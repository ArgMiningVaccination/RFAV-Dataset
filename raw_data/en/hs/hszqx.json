The Global Health Network WHO World Health Organization Summary XI Summary Background: Clinical trials have to follow strict standards in order to assure participant safety and data integrity. The development of these standards, however, did not include the perspec-tive from resource-limited settings, hence, leading to operational challenges when applied in these settings. Over the past decades, the conduct of clinical trials was characterised by inef-ficiency and waste, questioning in how far adherence to the existing standards reflects \"qual-ity\". A common and broadly accepted understanding of the concept of \"quality\" in clinical re-search has never been defined, potentially leading to wasteful, as well as undervalued clinical trial activities. An academic framework was developed to fill this gap; however, it did not con-sider the perspective of resource-limited settings. This thesis, therefore, sought to provide insight about particular needs in clinical trial guidance encountered in resource-limited settings and to contribute to the perception of \"clinical trial quality\" from a resource-limited perspective. Methods: We used a qualitative design, including semi-structured interviews with clinical trial stakeholders comprising investigators, sponsors, and monitors. 46 interviews were conducted with stakeholders having experience in 27 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Framework anal-ysis was performed to identify themes with respect to the entire clinical trial scope and build a clinical trial quality concept. We used MAXQDA software for the analysis. We additionally performed a systematic literature review to address the lack of guidance in the case of informed consent management for paediatric participants with minor parents. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar for articles pub-lished up to March 2019. In total, 4382 articles were screened, and two analyses were per-formed based on these articles. In the first analysis, 16 articles met our inclusion criteria. Var-ious study types addressing informed consent in clinical trials involving children with minor parents in sub-Saharan Africa were included. We performed descriptive and qualitative frame-work analyses. In the second analysis, 44 articles met our inclusion criteria. We included pub-lications of clinical trials that potentially included children with minor parents in sub-Saharan Africa and addressed informed consent. A descriptive analysis was performed. Results: Clinical trial quality definitions resulted in 11 elements, summarised into a clinical trial quality concept, consisting of two components: clinical trial quality-building factors (Scien-tific factors and Moral factors) and -promoting factors (Context adaptation; Infrastructure; Part-nership; Operational excellence; Quality system). 12 resource-limited settings specific themes were identified, which could be categorised under the promoting factors \"Context adaptation\", \"Infrastructure\", and \"Partnership\". Summary XII The systematic review showed that informed consent approaches for children with minor par-ents were variable and could involve either the minor parent, another representative or both. When individual consent by minor parents based on emancipation or \"mature minor\" status was applied, it lacked an evidence base in the context of research and mostly followed national laws on medical care. When no laws or guidance existed, an interpretation of the local deci-sion-making culture, including community engagement and collaboration with local ethics committees, defined the informed consent approach. In the secondary analysis, there was no robust evidence on whether any recruited children had minor parents and how consent was obtained for them. Explicit descriptions of proxy decision-makers were rare and were mostly provided in referenced clinical trial registrations or protocols. Also, terminology describing proxy decision-makers was often used inconsistently. Conclusions: A comprehensive clinical trial quality concept should be multidimensional, in-cluding quality-promoting factors in addition to scientific and ethical components. Considera-tion of resource-limited setting-specific aspects led to three clinical trial quality-promoting as-pects as possible additions to the INQUIRE framework: 1) Clear communication of infrastruc-tural disadvantages to funders, sponsors, and auditors, 2) Prevention of exploitation of re-search populations and workforce in resource-limited countries by following existing ethical frameworks, and 3) Context adaptation as an additional clinical trial quality promoter. Amend-ing the INQUIRE framework by adding these aspects could be beneficial for proactive imple-mentation of quality into clinical trials. The systematic literature review emphasised that the implementation of informed consent for children with minor parents may be context-dependent and hampered by absent or ambiguous clinical trial regulations, as well as divergent local realities. We recommended a set of ques-tions to be considered in the development of an ethically acceptable informed consent ap-proach and proposed information to be integrated into international clinical trial guidelines. The review further highlighted that CT reporting guidelines should require clinical trial publica-tions to state or reference exceptional informed consent procedures applied for special popu-lation groups. Moreover, international clinical trial guidelines should provide harmonised defi-nitions of proxy decision-maker types to facilitate correct and transparent informed consent for children and children with minor parents. Overall, adopting practical guidance on exceptional, or context-dependent situations into gen-eral guiding documents or referencing such guidance in the respective area was considered beneficial. This would, on the one hand, give more attention to these situations and, on the other hand, give more recognition to the related efforts.Introduction 1 1 Introduction 1.1 The importance of clinical trials Clinical trials (CTs) are controlled experiments on human subjects generating evidence on the safety and efficacy profiles of investigational products [1]. Therefore, CTs are an essential part of the development process of new medicines (i.e., drugs, vaccines or diagnostics), which first involves pre-clinical testing in tissue cultures and animal models typically followed by four clinical phases in humans. In the respective phases, CTs involve an increasing number of participants, and their focus moves from pure safety aspects to proof of concept to large scale confirmatory CTs being thus increasingly closer to real-life conditions [2, 3]. The data collected in CTs allow health authorities to decide on the investigational product's market authorisation [2]. Hence, CTs provide evidence-based knowledge that drives medical policymaking and ad-vancement. There is a continuous need for CTs to inform and improve global therapy standards: Some diseases lack effective treatments, or adverse drug reactions, as well as emerging drug re-sistance, may hinder the use of available treatments. Moreover, existing treatments are some-times not affordable or accessible to all those in need and require suitable alternatives. CTs are further necessary to improve therapeutic knowledge about specific patient groups, includ-ing women, children, the elderly or people with a lower socioeconomic status, which were previously underrepresented in clinical research [4, 5]. In resource-limited countries, CTs are of particular importance. While the global burden of disease is dominated by non-communicable diseases, resource-limited countries bear an over proportional share of communicable diseases [4]. These communicable diseases include HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and the group of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs; e.g., Buruli ulcer, Leishmaniasis, etc.) [5], and are further referred to in this thesis as poverty-related diseases. As poverty-related diseases correlate with high rates of early mortality, targeted and sustainable treatment options are undeniably needed [6]. Affected countries often lack the capacity to address this health disparity on their own. Therefore, fighting these diseases has been acknowledged as a global responsibility and health priority, which is reflected in the sus-tainable development goals (SDGs) and facilitated through various global and international initiatives and funding strategies [7, 8]. In this thesis, we focus on CTs conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) which is a region significantly affected by poverty-related diseases and resource-limitation. Introduction 2 1.2 The evolution of clinical trial guidelines As CTs involve experiments with human participants, they must follow ethical standards. These standards have undergone a long historical evolution. Already around the beginning of the 20th century, national food and drug legislation was used. However, the first internationally established ethical code of conduct for research was the Nuremberg Code in 1947, which resulted from problematic medical experiments led by Nazi members during World War II [9]. The Code essentially requires investigators to have a sound scientific basis for their experi-ment and to assure the participants' safety and voluntary participation [10]. Further disasters in clinical research, such as the thalidomide tragedy in 1961, contributed to the need for more extensive ethical guidance (Appendix 6.1, Figure S1) [9]. Consequently, the Declaration of Helsinki (DoH) was introduced in 1964 by the World Medical Association defining universal ethical principles for medical research involving human participants [11]. In 1982, the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) in collabo-ration with the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the International Ethical Guide-lines for Health-Related Research Involving Humans to facilitate the implementation of exist-ing ethical principles in research [12]. However, the implementation of CTs required additional standards, which led to a large variety of additional regulations. In order to achieve harmoni-sation in the conduct of CTs to promote the mutual recognition of CT data, a definition of common standards for CT became indispensable [9]. In 1996, the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals1 (ICH) published the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guideline [13]. The growing demand from regulatory authorities, ethics committees, funders and medical publishers for CTs to be ICH-GCP compliant ultimately led to the ICH-GCP guideline being recognised as the international standard for the conduct of CTs [14-16]. However, while the ICH-GCP guideline is defined as \"ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, recording and reporting trials that involve the participation of human subjects\" [1], it is unclear in how far adherence to this standard truly reflects the quality of CTs. Researchers argued that the guideline is not evidence-based, as it was built upon informal consensus, lacks references to literature or other systematic sources of information, and its benefits were not proven [17, 18]. Moreover, it was developed mainly by industry stakeholders 1 Before October 2015: International Conference for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals Introduction 3 and regulators, whereas it should also be followed by non-commercial, academic trials [17, 19, 20]. A restrictive interpretation of the guideline, including, for example, extensive CT documenta-tion and monitoring 100% of CT data, had contributed to an administrative burden that was disproportionate to the nature of many CTs [6, 17, 21]. At the same time, the heavy focus on assuring CT quality through \"reactive\" quality control measures, such as monitoring and au-diting, led to increasingly complex CT protocols [22], which, in turn, fuelled the demand for \"reactive\" quality control measures and contributed to a significant increase in study costs [23]. High study costs for their part contributed to increased outsourcing of CT activities to countries with lower salary costs [16], which reinforced the need for restrictive supervision of the com-pliance with CT regulation [22]. As a countermeasure, a trend towards \"proactive quality\" has been followed over the past decade [22]. Risk-based quality management principles and adapted monitoring approaches were promoted by various initiatives to increase the efficiency of the conduct of CTs [24-27]. Risk-based quality management involves identification and continuous evaluation of risks in-herent to the CT and prioritisation of quality measures according to the risk's potential impact. Adapted monitoring approaches include adjusting the monitoring intensity to the risk of a CT [28-30], as well as the possibility for remote or centralised monitoring with triggered monitoring visits [31]. These quality management principles were eventually adopted in a first amendment of the ICH-GCP guideline in 2016 [32]. Moreover, the concept of \"Quality by Design\" (QbD) was promoted by the Clinical Trial Trans-formation Initiative (CTTI), which is a US-based public-private-partnership between Duke Uni-versity and the FDA formed in 2007 [16]. QbD aims for prospective identification of possible errors or \"Critical to Quality Factors\" [33]. Thereby, a CT should be designed in a way to pre-vent errors, instead of coping with them retrospectively [29, 30]. These considerations on QbD were adopted by the draft version of the ICH E8(R1) General Considerations for Clinical Trials guideline (ICH-E8(R1) guideline) [34] and are planned to be also considered in a complete renovation of the ICH-GCP guideline that is currently ongoing [35]. Introduction 4 1.3 The need to define clinical trial quality In 2009, the Lancet provided striking evidence that 85% of CT investment was wasted [36]. A subsequent Lancet series entitled \"Increasing Value and Reducing Waste\" was published in 2014 and identified the following areas for improvement: proper selection of research ques-tions; robust study design; conduct and analysis; risk-based CT regulation and management; published and accessible results; and complete and useful reporting [37]. In order to promote quality in these areas, the authors started a campaign called \"Reduce Research Waste and Reward Diligence\" (REWARD) in 2016 [38]. Thereby, standardised tools and processes were promoted, such as the performance of systematic literature reviews when defining research questions; the application of the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) statement for CT protocol development [39]; the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement for appropriate reporting of randomised controlled trials [40]; and the registration of CTs in official CT registries before their initiation [41, 42]. The various areas for improvement addressed by the Lancet series brought CT quality into a broader context. In addition to the requirement of proactive and risk-adjusted CT quality man-agement, fundamental components of academic research (i.e., a scientifically sound method-ology) must be fulfilled, as otherwise, the CT becomes worthless. Since the overall perception of quality in CTs has been transitioning over the past decade, several CT quality definitions have been published to facilitate its management. For example, Switula explained CT quality according to ISO 9000:2015, which is an internationally recog-nised quality management standard for various industries [43]. The ISO 9000:20152 standard describes quality as \"the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics of an object meets the requirements\". Thereby, an object is defined as \"anything perceivable or conceivable\" (e.g., product, service, process, person, organisation, system, resource) and a requirement is defined as \"a need or expectation that is stated, generally implied or mandatory\" [44]. The CTTI also offered a perspective on CT quality, defining it as \"the absence of errors that matter to decision making - i.e., errors that have a significant impact on the safety of study partici-pants or the credibility of results (and thus on the care of future patients)\" [45]. Moreover, the current draft of the ICH-E8(R1) guideline contains another CTTI-inspired definition of CT qual-ity and considers it to be \"fitness for purpose\". Thereby, the purpose of a CT is to \"generate 2 In the paper by Switula ISO 9000:2001 was referenced, which used a slightly different phrasing for the quality definition and was superseded by the ISO 9000:2015. For the purposes of this thesis, the most recent definition was used. Introduction 5 reliable information to answer key questions and support decision-making while protecting trial participants\" [34]. However, a recent systematic literature review emphasised that there has been no generally recognised common definition of CT quality [46], which may be a potential source for wasteful as well as undervalued activities in CT management. Therefore, the authors developed a qual-ity framework for academic research \"INcreasing QUality In patient-oriented academic clinical REsearch (INQUIRE)\" that provides an overview combining established quality tools and guidelines [47]. Nevertheless, the framework was developed based on a review and compila-tion of existing quality aspects and, therefore, did not allow CT stakeholders to openly formu-late a definition of CT quality, which may have added new perspectives. Moreover, the IN-QUIRE framework designed to consider the needs of non-commercial trials only involved ex-perts from developed countries. 1.4 The need to consider a resource-limited settings perspective The following sections describe sensitivities and circumstances in resource-limited settings (RLS) that might influence perceptions of clinical trial quality: First, clinical researchers in resource-limited countries face particular challenges: Primarily, widespread poverty increases the vulnerability of the potential research population, as a lack of money, nutrition, health care and education can unduly influence individuals towards a CT participation [1]. Further, the frequently limited capacity of national ethics committees and reg-ulatory authorities can affect the CT overview and slow down approval processes [48-50]. In addition, there is a lack of education and career opportunities in the area of clinical research, which can affect the availability of qualified CT staff [19, 51]. Moreover, poverty-related dis-eases often affect remote areas where health facilities are inadequately equipped for research and difficult to access [52-54]. Legal frameworks for the conduct of CTs may also be missing or inconsistent [55], leaving certain CT aspects undefined (e.g., investigator qualifications, storage of the investigational product, informed consent and its documentation, essential doc-uments, notification of serious adverse events, and participant insurance and compensation). Also, studies can be affected by external factors such as climatic conditions or unstable local political situations [52-54]. Despite such challenges, CTs must meet the same quality stand-ards as developed countries, in order to get regulatory approval. However, when the ICH-GCP guideline was developed, the conditions in resource-limited countries were not taken into ac-count [14, 15, 50]. The need to adapt the ICH-GCP guideline to some common challenges in Introduction 6 resource-limited countries was debated in the past decade [15, 50]. Still, no respective adap-tations have yet been implemented. Second, several additional recommendations have been published in the meantime to support CTs in resource-limited countries. Among the most prominent examples are Ethical and Policy Issues in International Research: Clinical Trials in Developing Countries, published in 2001 by the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, The Ethics of Research Related to Health Care in Developing Countries and its follow-up Discussion Paper by the Nuffield Council on Bioeth-ics, published in 2002 [56] and 2005 [57], and The Ethical Principles for Clinical Research in Developing Countries by Emanuel et al. in 2004. These recommendations have never been updated since their implementation. However, in 2017, a CIOMS working group started to develop a new guideline. It aims to reach a consensus on \"pragmatic recommendations for environmental improvements and good practices for the social acceptance, planning, evalua-tion, implementation and interpretation of randomised controlled clinical trials in resource-con-strained environments (RLS)\" [58]. As the CIOMS recommendations are still under develop-ment, a perspective on CT quality arising from this thesis may provide additional input. Third, in sub-Saharan Africa, the conduct of CTs has been increasingly evolving in the past decades, and various Networks of Excellence have been established, promoted by interna-tional initiatives, including the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trial Partnership (EDCTP) and The Global Health Network (TGHN) [59]. In addition, special partnership models have been established to facilitate the implementation of CTs in RLS, such as public-private partnerships (PPPs), product development partnerships (PDPs) or consortia [52, 60]. Hence, this accumulated expertise in conducting successful CTs while having limited resources can potentially contribute to an understanding of critical contributors to CT quality. Fourth, Lang et al. emphasised that in sub-Saharan Africa, CTs often have different charac-teristics than in Europe, and include larger proportions of infectious diseases, children, and non-commercial financing [19]. As these characteristics might contribute to the way CTs are implemented, they may have a potential impact on the perception of CT quality and should be considered. While there are previous studies that have considered quality indicators, and monitoring as-pects specific to RLS [61, 62], we are not aware of studies that have developed a CT quality definition with particular focus on these settings. Therefore, the goal of Manuscript I (Defining clinical trial quality from the perspective of resource-limited settings: A qualitative study based on interviews with investigators, sponsors, and monitors conducting clinical trials in sub-Sa-Introduction 7 haran Africa) was to contribute to the recent trends in increasing awareness about the mean-ing of quality in CTs to help understanding how quality and efficiency in the conduct of CTs may be maximised. 1.5 Specific challenges with informed consent in resource-limited coun-tries Informed consent (IC) is a critical step in clinical research. It is the only way to allow the en-rolment of participants into research. Disregarding IC leads to a violation of human rights [11]. Only emergencies may justify a consent waiver or deferral if there is a clear indication of a potential benefit for the patient by the investigational medical product [63]. For a consent to be valid, it has to fulfil three elements: it has to be understood, voluntary and provided by a competent person, defined as someone who has the ability to understand the information pro-vided about the research [56]. However, in resource-limited countries, a number of challenges are faced, when considering these elements of IC validity: First, the understanding of potential CT participants might be hampered by limited school ed-ucation, substantial illiteracy rates and a large variety of national languages, which may not exist in written. There is a strong dependence on literate impartial witnesses, who need to be available [53]. Also, additional efforts may be needed to establish a basic knowledge about the concept of research [56]. Second, the participants' voluntariness may be influenced by hierarchical social structures. Some communities make important decisions collectively, baring the risk of potentially pres-suring individuals into CT participation [50, 64]. Also, local customs may require an initial agreement by a village chief, community leader or other family members in addition to an autonomous consent by individuals. Still, the participants need to be made aware of their in-dividual right to refuse or withdraw CT participation [65, 66]. Third, when individuals are considered incompetent to provide consent, a legally acceptable representative (LAR) must be available to consent on their behalf. As minors are generally considered incompetent, IC has to be provided by their parent(s) or a legal guardian3 [56]. In 3 The terminology defining such proxy decision-makers may be variable across guidelines as discussed in more detail in chapter 4.5.2 Transparency on proxy decision-makers and in the appendix 6.14 Examples and interpretations of proxy decision-maker definitions. Introduction 8 addition to this, children can provide assent according to their decision-making capacity (i.e., intellectual maturity). With growing age and maturity, children's decision-making capacity in-creases. Hence, the information provided and the assent process should be adapted accord-ingly [67]. While infants depend entirely on the consent by a LAR, adolescents may become emancipated or \"mature minors\" and provide autonomous consent [68]. Such cases include CTs in sensitive areas (e.g., sexual health-related research), where adolescents represent a significant proportion of the target population [69]. However, CTs involving such a vulnerable population should be generally of low risk and have a prospect of direct benefit [70]. The age of consent (i.e., the legal age of majority), the age of assent, as well as criteria for emancipa-tion or \"mature minor\" status are thereby subject to national legislation, which may be variable and difficult to define. Also, the identification of the appropriate LAR to provide consent for the child may pose chal-lenges. Persons accompanying children to medical facilities are not always the biological par-ents, as in some cultures, it is common to assign this duty to caregivers. As legal documenta-tion may not always be available, it might be difficult to determine the appropriate person to consent for these children, particularly when their home is kilometres away from the research site [50, 71, 72]. Further, a shared decision-making culture, such as provided by assent next to parental consent, might not be accepted in societies that follow strict hierarchical decision-making structures [73]. Gender dynamics (e.g., in a male-dominated society) may also com-plicate the IC process for children: Mothers might not be authorised to consent for their chil-dren without consulting their husbands or other family members [56]. Such consent may be subsequently revoked or silently refused by not showing up to visits [74]. Hence, a careful assessment of socioeconomic, linguistic, and cultural variations is essential to the develop-ment of appropriate paediatric IC processes [75]. 1.6 The need to evaluate informed consent approaches for children with minor parents in sub-Saharan Africa Due to high child morbidity [76-78], as well as high teenage pregnancy rates in SSA [79], it is probable for children recruited in clinical research in SSA to have minor parents. This situation raises the question of who should decide about CT participation on behalf of the child. Accord-ing to international guidelines, becoming a parent may grant \"emancipated\" or \"mature minor\" status, and authorise minors to consent autonomously [12, 80]. However, it remains unclear whether they are also allowed to consent on behalf of their children. While national guidance Introduction 9 may exist on the subject in some countries [81], it may be variable, missing, or in contradiction to local customs in others, which complicates the enrolment of such children in CTs [82]. There are three possible options for addressing the issue of IC for participation in CTs with children of minor parents (Figure 1): Figure 1: Informed consent possibilities for children of minor parents. 1) Exclusion of the child. Why should children of minor parents be included, when there are enough children with adult parents? However, such children would also be excluded from potential benefits provided, e.g., the continuous access to health care during the involvement in a CT. Also, a recent systematic literature review concluded that the most motivating factors for parents and children to participate in clinical research were: health benefit and altruism [83]. Therefore, preventing children from research based on the age of their parents would be unethical when they would otherwise be eligible to participate. Moreover, Ravinetto et al. state that children in SSA are the most vulnerable patients and, therefore, exclusion from research would be unfair and create a selection bias [15]. 2) Inclusion of the child with consent by the minor parent, considered emancipated or a \"ma-ture minor\". However, guidance concerning these definitions is ambiguous. In general medical treatment, emancipated adolescents may not always be deemed capable of consenting for themselves. At the same time, becoming a parent would, in some legislations, directly allow them to consent for their children [84]. Also, medical treatment does not necessarily translate equally to the sensitive field of clinical research. 3) Inclusion of the child with consent by a legally acceptable representative (LAR) that is not the minor parent. Again, guidance concerning appropriate persons to consent on behalf of Introduction 10 children is ambiguous [81]. Is additional assent or co-consent by the minor parent needed and feasible? How can the culturally rooted decision-making process, which may be different from legislation, be respected? Recently, various initiatives focusing on facilitating paediatric CT conduct were launched [85, 86]. The StaR Child Health Initiative contributed extensively to an improvement of paediatric CT quality by raising evidence about gaps in paediatric CT methodology and developing rec-ommendations also addressing IC [87, 88]. However, although this initiative also refers to special considerations in resource-limited countries, they do not address the case of consent for children with minor parents. As infants will continue to be a target population, especially when it comes to the development of vaccines in resource-limited countries, there will also be a probability of such infants to have minor parents. There is insufficient evidence to what extent this population has been consid-ered in the past, as there seems to be a general lack of transparency about their enrolment in clinical research. It is important and in line with the spirit of patient-centeredness to consider minority groups, address them appropriately, and provide them with adequate access to re-search and its potential benefits. Hence, the goal of Manuscript II (Informed consent ap-proaches for clinical trial participation of infants with minor parents in sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review) was to review literature to provide evidence and recommendations on IC approaches for such children. In addition, the goal of Manuscript III (Transparent reporting of recruitment and informed consent approaches in clinical trials recruiting children with minor parents in sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review) was to determine and promote transpar-ency regarding this situation in CT publications in order to adequately protect the rights of this extremely vulnerable population and facilitate their recruitment in the future. 1.7 Objectives 1.7.1 Research aim The PhD thesis is exploratory, and the overall goal is to contribute to the understanding of how clinical trial (CT) quality is composed from a resource-limited settings (RLS) perspective to allow an effective and efficient CT quality management. Introduction 11 1.7.2 Research questions 1) CT Quality definition a) How is CT quality defined by stakeholders involved in the conduct of CTs in RLS (sponsors, investigators, and monitors)? b) Are there differences to CT quality definitions in developed settings? c) Can developed settings benefit from a RLS perspective on CT quality? 2) Informed consent (IC) for CTs involving children with minor parents a) What IC approaches have been reported for children with minor parents in SSA? b) What needs to be considered to allow an appropriate IC approach for these chil-dren? c) How is the transparency on the recruitment and IC approach for these children in CT publications? d) How does the IC for children with minor parents relate to the overall CT quality? 1.7.3 Specific objectives The specific objectives of the thesis were: 1) CT Quality definition - To conduct interviews with CT stakeholders (sponsors, investigators, and moni-tors) from SSA. - To provide an overview of how these stakeholders define CT quality. - To develop a framework representing these CT quality definitions. - To determine the appropriateness of existing frameworks for developed settings. - To highlight possible differences from existing frameworks for developed settings. - To identify quality perspectives that could be of potential benefit for developed countries (reversed innovation). 2) IC for CTs involving children with minor parents - To review literature systematically to identify IC approaches for CTs with children of minor parents. - To determine the appropriateness of these IC approaches and highlight gaps. - To provide recommendations for the development of an appropriate IC approach for children of minor parents. - To provide recommendations for appropriate reporting of the IC approach. - To determine the relation of the IC management to the overall CT quality. Introduction 12 1.8 Justification This thesis aimed to contribute to a common understanding of CT quality by including the perspective of stakeholders involved in the conduct of CTs in resource-limited countries. Ini-tially, an exploratory mixed methods approach was planned. It first included a qualitative part, involving semi-structured interviews to define a conceptual framework of CT quality, and was followed by a quantitative part, involving a survey to confirm and elaborate the concept. How-ever, after defining the methodology, we gained awareness about a similar project conducted by a research group at the Department of Clinical Research at the University Hospital of Basel. The research group was developing a quality framework for clinical research based on a com-prehensive literature review, followed-up by a Delphi-survey [46, 47]. The development of the quality framework was already advanced and conducted on a larger scale, leading to a recon-sideration of the methods in this thesis. Eventually, an added value was recognised particu-larly in the qualitative part serving as a triangulation of methodology to challenge the quality framework and potentially complement it with specific aspects arising from resource-limited countries. Also, the decision to limit the research methodology for the CT quality definition to a solely qualitative approach, was reinforced and justified by the inclusion of a highly relevant, second research topic within the framework of CT quality. During the course of the first year, our In-stitute's Clinical Operations Unit (formerly: Pharmaceutical Medicines Unit) encountered a specific challenge during a CT conducted in sub-Saharan Africa: The informed consent ap-proach for children with minor parents. An analysis of this problem was found to be a relevant contribution the understanding of CT quality from the perspective of resource-limited coun-tries, hence, it was included in this thesis. As the informed consent part required the conduct of a systematic literature review, it also added a secondary methodological approach to the thesis, which eventually required more capacity than initially expected. However, the timeli-ness and the lack of information on the subject justified this effort. Introduction 13 1.9 Ethical clearance The PhD project was reviewed by the Ethikkommission Nordwest- und Zentralschweiz (EKNZ) and did not fall under the remit of the cantonal or federal law (Human Research Act). Hence, it was granted an exemption from ethical approval. However, the ethics committee confirmed that the project \"fulfils general ethical and scientific standards for research with humans and poses no health hazards\" (Appendix 6.2). As the interviews were conducted either in Basel or remotely from Basel (via phone or Skype), no international ethics clearances were necessary. Before starting the interviews, participants were informed (Appendix 6.3 and 6.4) and asked to provide oral consent, which was repeated for the record at the beginning of the interview. No ethical clearance was needed for the systematic literature review. 1.10 List of manuscripts Table 1: Resulted manuscripts Manuscript title Journal Status Defining clinical trial quality from the perspective of resource-limited settings: A qualitative study based on interviews with in-vestigators, sponsors, and monitors conducting clinical trials in sub-Saharan Africa PLOS Neglected Trop-ical Diseases Published Informed consent approaches for clinical trial participation of infants with minor parents in sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review PLOS One Published Transparent reporting of recruitment and informed consent ap-proaches in clinical trials recruiting children with minor parents in sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review BMC Public Health Published 1.11 List of references 1.

Recent evi-dence has highlighted that the lack of a clear clinical trial quality definition may have contrib-uted to previous inefficiencies. This study aims to support the understanding of what clinical trial quality entails from the perspective of resource-limited settings. 2.1.2 Methods We conducted 46 semi-structured interviews involving investigators, sponsors, and monitors with experience in conducting clinical trials in 27 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The ques-tionnaire addressed the overall meaning of clinical trial quality and a conclusive clinical trial quality definition, as well as specific aspects of resource-limited settings across the clinical trial process. We held the interviews either in person, via Skype or by phone. They were rec-orded and transcribed verbatim, and we performed the analysis using The Framework Method. 2.1.3 Results The analysis of clinical trial quality definitions resulted in 11 elements, which were summarised into a clinical trial quality concept consisting of two components: 1) clinical trial quality building factors (Scientific factors and Moral factors) and 2) promoting factors (Context adaptation; Infrastructure; Partnership; Operational excellence; Quality system). 12 resource-limited set-tings specific themes were identified. These themes were all categorised under the promoting factors \"Context adaptation\", \"Infrastructure\", and \"Partnership\". 2.1.4 Conclusions We found that in order to enable comprehensive clinical trial quality management, clinical trial quality should be defined by a multidimensional concept that includes not only scientific and ethical, but also quality-promoting factors. Such a concept is of general relevance and not limited to clinical trials in resource-limited settings, where it naturally carries particular weight. In addition, from the perspective of sub-Saharan Africa, we identified specific categories that appear to be critical for the conduct of clinical trials in resource-limited settings, and we pro-pose respective changes to a particular existing clinical trial quality framework (i.e., INQUIRE). Manuscript I 22 2.2 Author summary In recent decades, the quality management of clinical trials has been criticised for being inef-ficient and ineffective. This has led to a waste of clinical trial investment and has made it particularly difficult to conduct clinical trials in settings with limited resources. The lack of a universally accepted comprehensive definition of clinical trial quality was suggested as one of the possible causes of inadequate quality management. However, resource-limited countries were not considered in the attempt to create such a definition. In our study, we developed a quality concept based on qualitative interviews from the perspective of investigators, spon-sors, and monitors with experience in conducting clinical trials in sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis of these stakeholders' definitions of clinical trial quality has produced a Clinical Trial Quality Concept that includes quality-promoting factors (i.e., Context adaptation; Infrastruc-ture; Partnership; Operational excellence; Quality system) in addition to conventional scientific and ethical factors. The results thus support the need for a multidimensional quality concept to reflect clinical trial quality more comprehensively. We recommend the term \"Comprehensive Quality Management (CQM)\" for this concept. CQM has the potential to serve as a basis for the current revision of quality management principles in international clinical trial guidelines. Furthermore, the sub-Saharan African perspective has highlighted additional considerations compared to the existing comprehensive INQUIRE clinical trial quality framework. Therefore, we propose including the following three points relevant to resource-limited settings in the frame- work: 1) Communicating potential infrastructural disadvantages to funders, sponsors, and auditors. 2) Preventing potential exploitation of research populations and workforce in low- and middle-income countries by following existing ethical frameworks. 3) Including \"Con-text adaptation\" as an additional framework category (i.e., promoting factor). 2.3 Introduction The conduct of clinical trials (CTs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is essential, as it contributes to combatting the burden of poverty-related diseases. Irrespective of the re-search setting, CTs must meet international standards to assure the public of the participants' safety and data integrity [1]. Today's most widely recognised CT guideline is the Good Clinical Practice guideline by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH-GCP) [2]. The guideline is defined as \"ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, recording and reporting trials that involve the participation of human subjects\" [3]. However, it is unclear to what extent it is actually linked to the quality of CTs, as its development was Manuscript I 23 criticised for not being evidence-based [4, 5]. Moreover, it was developed mainly based on a pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authority perspective from the Global North, which leads to challenges when the guidance is applied to other settings, e.g., non-commercial, ac-ademic CTs, or CTs conducted in LMICs [4, 6, 7]. Also, an overly restrictive interpretation of the ICH-GCP guideline has been associated with decreasing efficiency in CT conduct in the past. Particularly, there was increasing evidence that the practice of assuring CT quality by implementing extensive monitoring was ineffective [1, 4, 8]. This \"reactive\" quality management approach had contributed to CT protocols be-coming increasingly complex, in turn fuelling the demand for restrictive quality control measures and driving CT costs [9, 10]. Consequently, the concept of quality management in CTs was reconsidered in CT guidance, promoting a risk-based approach, which was inte-grated into a first amendment of the ICH-GCP guideline in 2016 [3]. The ICH guideline is currently being completely revised, with one of the goals being to promote a proactive consid-eration of quality when designing CT protocols and processes by identifying \"Critical to Quality Factors\" [11-13]. It has further been demonstrated that as much as 85% of investment in global CT implemen-tation has been wasted [14]. The main reasons were deficiencies in research question selec-tion; study design, conduct, and analysis; CT regulation and management; publication and accessibility of results; and completeness and usability of reporting [15]. These findings high-light that the conduct of CTs has essential quality attributes that go beyond compliance with the current ICH-GCP guideline. A recent systematic literature survey found that there is no generally accepted consensus on a definition of CT quality [16]. A possible difference in understanding by the various stakehold-ers involved in CTs about what constitutes quality in CTs can inherently lead to both, under-valued and wasteful activities. Consequently, the authors of that study developed a quality framework called INcreasing QUality In patient-oriented academic clinical REsearch (IN-QUIRE) to summa- rise the quality criteria for CTs and achieve broad consensus [17]. The framework also provides an overview of existing standard tools to assure the quality of differ-ent parts of a CT (e.g., systematic reviews to define research questions, the SPIRIT statement for protocol development, the CONSORT statement for study publications, following GCP dur-ing the CT conduct, monitoring, and auditing). However, for the development of the INQUIRE framework, a LMICs' perspective was not considered, nor was an openly formulated CT quality definition sought. Our study aims to provide a complementary viewpoint on the definition of CT quality from the perspective of CTs conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. On the one hand, this perspective allows Manuscript I 24 the identification of challenges of CT conduct in LMICs. On the other hand, the analysis of CT quality in the context of resource-constraint situations may give insight into critical factors con-tributing to quality and efficiency in the conduct of CTs anywhere in the world. 2.4 Methods This explorative research follows both an inductive (based on raw data) and deductive (based on concept) theoretical approach. Such an interpretive model represents and involves the in-terplay of evidence and ideas. By this, collected data are reviewed in terms of theories and concepts and critically reflect on meaningful and reasonable causal relationships, contrasts and similarities, and homogeneity and heterogeneity in view of received meanings, percep-tions and notions. The identified significant patterns of meaning are of scientific, practice, or policy relevance. Consequently, the analytical procedure of this study is grounded on The Framework Method according to Gale et al. and its seven steps of data analysis [18]. 2.4.1 Ethics statement The study was reviewed by the ethics committee Ethikkommission Nordwest- und Zen-tralschweiz (EKNZ). It was granted an exemption from ethical approval, as it did not fall under the Human Research Act's remit. The ethics committee confirmed that the project \"fulfils gen-eral ethical and scientific standards for research with humans and poses no health hazards\". The stakeholders were contacted by email and received an information sheet addressing the study aim, privacy information, and the interviewers' contact details and credentials. The pri-vacy information included that the interview was voluntary, that withdrawal from the study was possible at any time, and that all identifying information are kept confidential. If they agreed to participate, an appointment was made for the interview. At the beginning of each interview, participants gave verbal consent to participate and their statements to be audio-recorded. We followed the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ, Appendix 6.5, Table S1) [19] and verified the trustworthiness of our methods based on criteria described by Anney [20]. 2.4.2 Study design and setting The study followed a qualitative research approach based on interviews with stakeholders having CT experience in at least one country in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The stakeholders could originate from in or outside SSA. Due to the large number of targeted countries, no travelling was intended. The interviewers were based in Switzerland and most interviews were Manuscript I 25 conducted remotely, either by phone or via Skype. Some interviews were conducted face-to-face in Switzerland, with visiting stakeholders. We focused on three stakeholder groups composed of sponsor representatives (referred to as 'sponsors'), investigators, and monitors with experience in conducting CTs in SSA. These stakeholder groups were selected as they are involved in CT planning, conduct, and quality control and were expected to provide comprehensive knowledge about the entire CT scope. A semi-structured interview guide using open-ended questions was chosen. It offered the pos-sibility to define the interview's core components but still allowed the interview participants to address further topics intuitively. The interviews were conducted by the lead and the second author. Both are pharmacists, female, and acquired interview experience in training and pilot rounds prior to the study. The application of the methods and interpretation of the findings was supervised and reviewed by an experienced social scientist. 2.4.3 Sampling and recruitment First, purposive sampling was applied: a list of interventional studies conducted in SSA (ex-cluding South Africa) between 2013 and 2017 was extracted from the WHO International Clin-ical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) [21]. The ICTRP was chosen as it accesses CT data from multiple providers, including ClinicalTrials.gov [22] and the Pan African Clinical Trial Reg-istry (PACTR) [23]. The study period was chosen in order to access stakeholders conducting CTs according to latest ethical guidelines (i.e., the latest update of the Declaration of Helsinki in 2013) and having most current contact details. Also, in earlier study periods, less countries in SSA were involved in the conduct of CTs. South Africa was excluded from the sample to achieve greater diversity of SSA countries, as South Africa accounts for a disproportionately high number of CTs compared to other countries in SSA. All investigators and sponsor and monitor organisations available in the ICTRP extract were systematically contacted. Second, as sponsors and monitors in particular were difficult to access through information provided in CT registries, we additionally applied a strategy of snowball sampling: a) We drew on an independent network that we established at international conferences prior to the study. Thereby, we distributed flyers and approached CT stakeholders asking them about their inter-est in participating in the interview and requesting their contact details. In addition, we screened for contacts based on the conference participant lists. b) We reached out to the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute's (Swiss TPH) professional network. Manuscript I 26 Interested members of these networks were asked to participate in the interview, as well as to provide us with further contacts until we reached sufficient participants in each stakeholder group. The sample size was defined according to the principle of saturation: Once the inter-viewers had the impression that no or only a few new content-related elements were men-tioned per stakeholder group, the sample size was considered sufficient. Thereby, the focus was set on defining key elements of CT quality. While investigators were reached through both sampling strategies (purposive and snowball), sponsors and monitors were mainly reached through snowball sampling (Box 1). Box 1: Interview participant recruitment and response rates 77 potential investigators were contacted based on the ICTRP and previous personal contact: \u00e0 17 persons accepted, 11 refused, the rest didn't reply to our interview invitation 103 potential sponsors and sponsor's organisations were contacted based on the ICTRP: \u00e0 1 person accepted, 4 refused, the rest didn't reply to our interview invitation 43 potential (known and unknown) monitors and CRO's were contacted based on the ICTRP: \u00e0 3 persons accepted, 8 refused, the rest didn't reply to our interview invitation 71 potential participants (sponsors, investigators, and monitors) were personal contacts from international conferences and recommendations: \u00e0 25 persons accepted, 21 refused, the rest didn't reply to our interview invitation 48 interviews were conducted \u00e0 2 interviews were excluded as the participant only had experience in observational re-search and not in clinical trials 46 interviews were finally included ICTRP: International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; CRO: Contract Research Organisation 2.4.4 Data collection The semi-structured interview guide (Appendix 6.6, Table S2) was based on an extensive preliminary literature review to cover the entire CT scope. Nine pilot testing interviews involving staff from the home institution with experience in CTs were conducted to gain information, limit the topic, identify a clear focus of the research scope, and improve the interview guide's clarity. The participant information sheet and interview guide were written in English and translated into French to extend the range of possible participants. The translation was checked for cor-rect terminology by French- and English-speaking persons. The following key topics were covered in the interview guide with reference to CTs conducted in SSA: personal and professional background; interpretation of CT quality in general; experi-ence in CT planning, design, initiation, conduct, and termination; collaboration of CT stake-holders; reflection on CT quality; and conclusion based on a one-sentence CT definition. The interviews were conducted between March and August 2018 and lasted 35-75 minutes. They were recorded using a digital voice recorder (Olympus Digital Voice Recorder VN-733PC), transcribed verbatim, and coded using MAXQDA 2018 VERBI software. During the interviews, the interviewer took notes to reflect and apply minor clarifications to the interview Manuscript I 27 guide for the subsequent interviews. Each audio file was re-listened by a second person, and the interview transcript was double-checked. The data output was anonymised to prevent the identification of interview participants or organisations. Only the lead author has access to the key for data anonymisation. 2.4.5 Data analysis The interviews were coded and analysed according to The Framework Method [18]. First, we developed framework matrices for the one-sentence and general CT quality definitions pro-vided by the respondents. The one-sentence CT quality definition matrix served as the basis for defining main categories that form the components of a CT quality concept. The general CT quality definition matrix was used to confirm and complement these categories. Second, the complete interview transcripts were screened collecting additionally resource- limited settings (RLS) specific themes. These themes were assigned to the CT quality concept categories. The RLS-specific themes were identified by reflecting on which aspects mentioned by respondents across all interview topics dare likely to be influenced by the research setting. Two authors coded and analysed the one-sentence CT quality definition. The remaining text was coded and analysed by one author and reviewed by a second author. All interviews were re-coded once by the same or a second author. During the coding process, memos on the content were created to support reflections. The codes as well as initial and final categories were reviewed and discussed with the co-authors. 2.5 Results 2.5.1 Participants We conducted 46 interviews, including 21 investigators, 13 sponsors, and 12 monitors. Satu-ration of information was reached after 10-12 interviews. For the investigators' group, satura-tion was reached after almost double that number, as a large proportion (n=8/21) of investiga-tors only had experience in investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Interview participants had expe-rience in 27 countries in SSA and the workplace of more than half of all participants (n=25/46) was in SSA. The participant characteristics show some notable differences between groups (e.g., work-place, place of CT conduct, years of experience, research environment). However, the char-acteristics of the total number of interview participants were relatively balanced (Table 2).

The average CT experience of the interview participants was 11.8 years. Most participants were involved in phase II and III CTs and focused on drugs (Table 3). About half of the partic-ipants experienced more than one CT phase (n=24/46) and more than one intervention type (n=23/46).

When con-sidering the registered number of CTs conducted in SSA [20], the countries of conduct were broadly reflected in this study (Table 4). While some countries were slightly underrepresented (Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, Cameroon, Zambia), only two (Zimbabwe and Botswana) were clearly underrepresented [20]. As expected, sponsors (5.4) and monitors (4.8) had on average worked in more countries in SSA than investigators (1.7).

Then, the various stages of a CT were run through to create a general overview of the CT process, and in the end, the participants were requested to define the term \"clinical trial quality\" in one sentence. The outcome of this task perfectly summarised the challenge of narrowing this topic down, as many participants (n=15/46) expressed that this request was challenging or even impossible, and the responses diverged widely and mostly contained mul-tiple aspects: Manuscript I 30 \"[Laughs] I don't know, one sentence is really difficult because it's so much, it's so many aspects I would say you cannot really define it in one sentence [...].\" - Investigator, female, 8 years of CT experience, based outside SSA The original responses can be found in (Appendix 6.7, Table S4). We coded the aspects men-tioned by the participants when defining CT quality and grouped them into the following main elements according to descending frequency (Table 5): Data integrity; Adherence; Soundness of research; excellence; Partnership; Infrastructure; Relevance and patient-centeredness; Documentation; and Context adaptation. Table 5: Categorisation of the clinical trial quality codes into elements Element Codes Data integrity Clinical trial data reflect the clinical trial quality; ensuring that the data are reproducible, verifiable, reliable, solid, credible, authentic, consistent, accurate, good, conclusive, close to reality, trustwor-thy, excellent, clear, and complete; entering data systematically; safeguarding the data integrity; successful achievement of a correct conclusion from a study Adherence Strict/disciplined/rigorous/mandatory adherence to general requirements, such as good clinical prac-tice (GCP), good clinical laboratory practice (GCLP), good manufacturing practice (GMP), and ethi-cal standards, adherence to specific requirements, such as the protocol, standard operating proce-dures (SOPs), study manuals, and national regulations Soundness of re-search Doing the right; good science; sound scientific premise; no waste; excellent research question; ro-bust study design; clear and simple protocol; looking for the right kind of data; minimisation of bias; sound research valid/meaningful/valuable re-sults/correct conclusions/representative figure; meeting the objectives; clear data collection tools Participant safety & rights Quality equals safety; protecting/ensuring safety, wellbeing, rights, confidentiality; integrity of volun-teers; subjects not put at risk; good participant experience; think about participant safety first; apply-ing all necessary safety measures; having a good safety awareness; no harm Quality system A number of aspects should be fulfilled; interaction of multiple factors; totality of data, material and staff; quality is everything/a continuous process/the whole package/a sum of overall implementation; looking at all aspects; a set of factors enabling the collection of data; having robust quality manage-ment; steps to ensure quality/consistency; having SOPs at each level; having manuals; ensuring maintenance instruments; having supervision; do-ing clinical quality control procedures (e.g., im-plementing monitoring/audits); checking in real-time; picking up errors in time; immediate checks; automatic checks Operational excellence Doing it right; doing the best; clever approaches; proper implementation; sophisticated; making smooth/sound trial execution; maintain relationships; networking/exchanging; motivation; communica-tion; meeting the expectations by all parties involved (e.g., sponsors, investigators, local investiga-tors, CRO); alignment of expectations; sharing values, beliefs, and principles; mutual acceptance; taking the community into account; consider the study type; capacity building Infrastructure Having a team; qualified personnel; basic clinical trial understanding (e.g., GCP, GCLP); specific research project understanding; knowing what to do, sticking to the timelines; continuous staff training; mentoring; systems knowledge; variable regula-tions; adequate facility/equipment/resources Relevance & Pa-tient centeredness Generating meaningful results for the population (e.g., life improvement of a vulnerable population); having an important research question; utility of the results; putting more focus on the safety than on the publication; having outcomes that people can see; understanding the participants' needs; ad-dressing the populations' needs; benefits are rather early than late Documentation Trace the research; having a trial master file; having a research protocol; having documented what you have formulated in your case report forms; transparency; having logs Context adapta-tion Adapted to the context (e.g., study environment, population, disease); variable norms (e.g., meaning of blood samples in a cultural context, involvement of the community); consider regional aspects (e.g., weather, politics, etc.); adapted to local guidelines and regulations Manuscript I 31 The major consensus we identified, when comparing the CT quality definitions, is that \"clinical trial quality\" involves multiple layers (n=10/46). \"Let's say, it's a full quality assurance management system that looks at all the aspects and tries to set up systems for all these aspects, not too heavy, but that can cover many aspects and not only one [...]. I mean not just SOP's [standard operating procedures], it goes beyond SOP's, it goes...it's also just [...]. Yes, how to cleverly recruit people, how to cleverly follow the data, so, it has several aspects.\" - Investigator, female, 20 years of CT experience, based outside SSA While data integrity as well as participant safety and rights, generally ranked among the ele-ments most frequently associated with CT quality, several participants (n=6/46) referred uniquely to those two broad elements. Half of these participants were sponsors, and half were investigators who had experience in sponsored CTs (commercial or non-commercial). \"Clinical trial quality is about [...] providing assurance that the data you collect is credible and accu-rate and at the same time making sure that, you know, all the safety, the wellbeing, the rights, integrity of the volunteers are taken into account or are protected.\" - Investigator, male, over 10 years of CT experience, based in SSA The elements of data integrity as well as participant safety and rights, were overall most fre-quently addressed by sponsors, while adherence was most frequently mentioned by monitors, and investigators referred most frequently to the soundness of the research. When considering additionally the request to describe the meaning of quality in an unrestricted way, the same elements defining CT quality were found. Interestingly, although the overall ranking of elements was slightly variable between the unlimited and the one-sentence CT quality definition, the stakeholder groups mentioning the elements most frequently remained the same, as described above. Overall, the 11 CT quality elements could be organised into two components: 1) CT quality building factors covering the entire CT process (i.e., concept, plan, conduct, analysis, and reporting) and 2) CT quality-promoting factors. The building factors were further subdivided into i) Moral factors, including the elements \"Participant safety and rights\"; and \"Adherence\" to general requirements, and ii) Scientific factors, including the elements \"Relevance and pa-tient-centeredness\"; \"Scientific \"Quality system\", and \"Operational excellence\" (Figure 2). Manuscript I 32 Figure 2: Clinical trial quality concept 2.5.3 Resource-limited setting specific themes When asking about the influence of conducting CTs in resource-limited settings (RLS) on the overall perception of CT quality, some participants first stressed that the quality standard for CTs should be the same, no matter where the CT is conducted. Nevertheless, participants also indicated that RLS show several characteristics that need to be taken into account to allow the implementation of the same standards. These characteris-tics could be mainly associated with the CT quality-promoting factors \"Context adaptation\", Table S5). 2.5.3.1 Context adaptation Several interviewees mentioned the need to adapt CT processes to the context relating to the population's overall health conditions (n=15/46), accessibility (n=11/46), and education levels (n=25/46), as well as to consider cultural (n=10/46) and regional (n=7/46) specificities as sub-themes. Health condition. Some interviewees highlighted the researchers' responsibility to consider the generally limited access to healthcare and to manage it ethically (e.g., motivation for CT participation, post-trial treatment access, and appropriate compensation). Also, there is a higher probability of serious co-morbidities and unregistered concomitant medication (e.g., using traditional medicine), which should be addressed, as they could affect patient manage-ment and study outcomes. Further, the eligibility criteria should be based on population-spe-cific laboratory norm values, and the development of simultaneous research activities or health intervention programs in the area should be observed. Manuscript I 33 \"But also it could be, and this is an example [...] where [...] the local circumstances were such that one of the communities had been heavily researched. It was actually over-researched, and then people are actually tired. So, if you go into that particular area to do a trial again, you may end up with low rates of recruitment [...].\" - Investigator, male, over 10 years of CT experience, based in SSA Accessibility. Some interviewees mentioned that potential study participants might be difficult to access, particularly in rural areas. They may live far away from health and research facilities, have limited or no mobile phone access, as well as unregistered households. Moreover, ne-glected diseases may be rare and spread over large areas, requiring adapted recruitment and follow-up approaches (e.g., active recruitment with mobile laboratories). Education levels. Due to limited access to health education, research populations in RLS may have lower awareness about the meaning of research. Some interviewees emphasised that such awareness should be raised before any CT activity is started to prevent rumours and misconceptions (e.g., the meaning of blood, signatures, stigma), as they may seriously impede the recruitment of CT participants. Especially when developing the informed consent process, high illiteracy rates, and the fact that the national language may not be spoken and some local languages may not exist in writing should be considered (e.g., availability of literate impartial witnesses and translators, audio-visual consent tools). \"Good informed consent is [...] the one that can be managed best between being short in text and also complying with all the points that have to appear in an informed consent as of ICH-GCP. [...] we more and more go towards audio, audio informed consents. The reality is that in sub-Saharan Africa, in most of the West African countries and East African countries, languages are not written. [...] Even if a very literate person speaks well his native language, he can never read it.\" - Monitor, female, 14 years of CT experience, based in SSA Overall, many interviewees (n=15/46) stressed that the informed consent form should be kept short or simple. Some also recommended assessing the participants' understanding depend-ing on their background knowledge and the research complexity before including them in the study. Culture. Many interviewees (n=23/46) stressed the importance of engaging community rep-resentatives when developing the informed consent process (see also the subtheme Collab-oration), as certain aspects may vary according to the cultural context, such as the age of consent, the definition of appropriate representatives to consent on behalf of children, the need of an initial consent by community leaders before addressing individuals, or the appro-priateness of group sessions. Manuscript I 34 \"Usually, for the informed consent, you take the initials of the subject. But in Africa, you can find some people with six to seven names, and the legal representative is also not necessarily he father and mother; an aunt or an uncle could act as a legal representative or elderly people from the same village [...]. So, I think an understanding of the culture while you are conducting a clinical trial is also important.\" - Sponsor, female, over 3 years of CT experience, based outside SSA Region. Some interviewees mentioned that the seasonal disease variability, climatic condi-tions, political stability, and public holidays might further impede the participant recruitment (e.g., participant reachability) or interfere with internet and mobile phone network connectivity, shipment and transport schedules, as well as storage conditions. 2.5.3.2 Infrastructure A key topic emerging from many interviews (n=13/46) when asking about aspects in RLS that affect CT quality were the long timelines that must be considered because of infrastructural shortcomings. Such shortcomings were mainly associated with the subthemes of health au-thority approval, availability of guidelines, staff qualification, and facility level. Health authority approval. Responses by interviewees clarified that the experience and re-sponsibilities of health authorities may vary widely across SSA. For example, ethics commit-tees may have different requirements (e.g., serious adverse event reporting timelines, inspec-tions, periodic reports, personal or electronic protocol submission). Their approval time may range from two weeks to over one year. Twelve interviewees, who combined had experience in 20 countries in SSA, stressed that national ethics committees' approval time was often long and unpredictable. Internal bureaucracy and high workload with limited capacity were blamed for the delays. The ethics committees' diversity was perceived as a particular challenge when conducting multinational trials, and a joint review was recommended. A few interviewees also mentioned that in some countries, the ethics committees' capacity had improved significantly over the past years and rather considered the regulatory authorities' capacity one of the most limiting factors. Overall, interviewees recommended anticipating long approval processes in RLS, prioritising, and planning more flexibly. Availability of guidelines. A monitor with experience in about half of all reported countries in SSA (n=13/27) highlighted that some countries might have established CT guidelines at a national or institutional level, while others may have none. Another interviewee further noted that some countries might be in the process of establishing a research infrastructure; there-fore, country-specific requirements may change frequently, and researchers have to adapt to them for every new CT. Manuscript I 35 All interview participants mentioned that they followed the ICH-GCP guideline. Established guidelines were reportedly mainly based on the ICH-GCP guideline, including additional, country-specific operationalisations. \"So, some of the recommendations of the ICH-GCP are contextualised in the local guidelines, so, they are really brought to the context of the countries. But they are largely the same, so, we don't see many divergences from these in critical things.\" - Sponsor, male, over 3 years of CT experience, based in SSA Examples of such setting-specific requirements included: reporting frequency to ethics com-mittees; participant compensation; initial community permission; community engagement; and drug im-/exportation; disease-specific guidance; staff licences (e.g., qualifications for principal investigators/monitors); insurance cover and indemnity; participant type specific guidance (e.g., paediatrics); and informed consent (e.g., age of assent/ consent). Staff qualification. When considering staff qualification, interviewees (n=11/46), who to-gether had CT experience in over two-thirds of the reported countries in SSA (n=19/27), called out some disadvantages in the education system: The principles of scientific work and GCP were not sufficiently represented during medical training; therefore, in some regions, the grad-uates were less familiar with, e.g., the concepts of documentation, validation, and deviation. This situation could have consequences for CT quality, as one respondent explained: \"Medical doctors, investigators, are not trained to use a computer in their routine practice. If you ask them to report [...], you face a bottleneck. If you want to go around this and say, ok, we will hire data entry clerks; those data entry clerks can't read the medical handwritings. They can't, because these people aren't trained for research to write them clearly! So, if you want to go around this, too, you will now design very nice source documents, you know, you see where we are going now. We are going to a very tricky, and I call it a poisonous way of doing, but it is now invading clinical research in Africa. You will now design some sort of source document, which is actually a printout of the CRF. Just a data capture tool. The medics and the investigator will just complete that data capture tool and will no more do their medics. They will not do routine practice!\" - Monitor, female, 14 years of CT experience, based in SSA Interviewees also emphasised that inexperienced researchers need time to grow accustomed to these concepts before taking on responsibilities in a CT. One sponsor pointed out the need to start working with an inexperienced site at least one year before implementing the CT. Overall, pilot runs, being initially accompanied by or following experienced researchers from other institutions, and close supervision were considered essential for CT quality when work- ing with less experienced staff. Manuscript I 36 Facility level. Facilities described by interviewees could be very variable and ranged from field labs over primary to tertiary health care facilities to specialised CT units within hospitals or institutional research centres. Urban and rural settings were both common. Most stakehold-ers had experience using existing facilities, which were frequently upgraded in terms of CT equipment and space. Some (n=8/46) had also experienced establishing facilities from the ground up. When working in remote, rural facilities, the coordination of material supply, as well as limited power and internet connectivity, were the main concerns for CT quality due to possible delays. According to interviewees, shipments could involve a lot of bureaucracy in some regions, while the limited internet may require the use of paper Case Report Forms (CRFs), losing the ben-efits of electronic CRFs, which were summarised by an interviewee as follows: \"Before, you would have to go through all these papers, and after a few hours, you also get slightly dizzy. But now they have these electronic CRFs that alert you already if there is something out of range [...] probably an error that was entered. So, this combination of this electronic CRF, also the way that we now electronically download, e.g., biochemistry and haematology data and upload it into the database prevents a lot of unnecessary query resolution.\" - Investigator, female, 10 years of CT experience, based outside SSA Some interviewees (n=9/46) highlighted the importance of a site assessment visit or question-naire for an appropriate site selection and study planning. However, a sponsor also warned that formal site assessments were not always desired due to the possibility of harming a cen-tre's reputation. 2.5.3.3 Partnership Under the element of \"Partnership\", CT quality was mainly associated with the subthemes of collaboration, communication, and sustainability. Collaboration. Since various organisations and stakeholders are always involved in the con-duct of CTs, interviewees mentioned the importance of good collaboration. Thereby, half of all interviewees (n=23/46) stressed the importance of community engagement when planning a CT (e.g., involving a community advisory board or community representatives). \"So, this is the group of volunteers of the community, who sort of act as a communication channel between the clinical trial team and the community. So, those also look at whatever you are planning to do, and they give feedback.\" - Investigator, male, 7 years of CT experience, based in SSA Manuscript I 37 Funders may explicitly require community engagement, and in some cases, the ethics com-mittee may be responsible for organising it. Community engagement could also involve re-search activities to assess the community's perspective on CTs. Many interviewees (n=30/46) emphasised the need to involve site investigators and their team early in the CT development in order to adapt to the site's working capacity (assessing the need for assistance or extra staff for, e.g., budgeting, accounting, or quality management) and the staff's routines and schedules (e.g., consider weekends and holidays) as well as to assure protocol and CRF suitability, and particularly to share responsibility. \"We always involve people in the very early stages of an idea. Because you can have a very nice idea, but if it's impossible, people are not motivated to do so, it's not going to work out. So, involving people from sub-Saharan Africa at a very early stage is very important to make sure that they are also owner of the idea and owner of the program. So, ownership is crucial!\" - Investigator, male, over 15 years of CT experience, based outside SSA Communication. Good communication was associated with CT quality by many interviewees (n=36/46). Thereby, interviewees referred to having a communication system between all par-ties involved in the CT and good communication tools. Some emphasised the notification of important stakeholders about the planning of a CT, reporting to, e.g., ethics committees during the CT, and informing the community about the CT outcomes. For external sponsors and prin-cipal investigators, regular and open communication was recommended (e.g., clear definition of roles, communication of expectations, exchange experiences). Moreover, cultural sensitivity was mentioned for the way of communication between the site staff and research participants, as well as between monitors and the site staff. It was also considered crucial for external sponsors to visit research sites to gain a good understanding of the study environment. Sustainability. In some interviews (n=17/46), it became clear that funding mechanisms, which could also depend on the CT model (i.e., IIT, industry, mixed partnerships), could be very variable and indirectly affect CT quality by influencing capacity building and sustainability. Ac-cording to interviewees, some funders had clear expectations for CTs (e.g., following ICH-GCP, implementing capacity building, electronic data capturing tools, or community engage-ment), while others predominantly cared for the CT to deliver results. One interviewee empha-sised that applying for competitive grants could particularly result in very limited funding, with only a little flexibility for adjustment. However, flexibility in the budget was necessary for many interviewees (n=25/46) who had to adjust the funding mainly because, e.g., the CT had taken longer than expected or due to protocol amendments. Manuscript I 38 Five interviewees raised particular concerns about the importance of adequate core funding and long-term partnership to provide workplace security and sustain research expertise inbe-tween studies. \"The core funding, and the core support for clinical trial teams is often very limited, and that means also that after one trial that even if it's only half a year or a one-year break in-between, you might have to start again from scratch because the team could not be paid throughout and they, of course, go somewhere else [...].\" - Investigator, male, 8 years of CT experience, based outside SSA Moreover, the establishment of local education programs (e.g., involving students in the CT conduct) and creating more research opportunities by increasing the visibility of research sites, investing in blood-/biobanks, or expanding laboratory capacity were proposed to increase the capacity and sustainability of CT conduct. However, three interviewees stressed that this could only be achieved if governments were more committed. For example, in some countries in SSA, research was considered a \"luxury\" and therefore as a lower priority. 2.6 Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this study provides a first overview of the definition of the term \"clinical trial quality\" by researchers with experience in conducting CTs in RLS. Moreover, it offers an insight into how the research context may contribute to this understanding. The in-terviewees who represented typical CT models (i.e., IIT, industry, mixed partnerships) in RLS had vast and diverse experience, sometimes in multiple CT models and countries, and could provide comparisons. Overall, the complexity and multi-layered nature of CT quality, as well as the difficulty of ex-pressing it, led to great variability in its definition (Appendix 6.7, Table S4). A conceptual inter-pretation of the definitions was therefore considered the best way to capture the different lay-ers. The resulting quality elements were compiled into a composition of CT quality building (i.e., scientific and moral factors) and -promoting factors (Figure 2). In comparison, these com-ponents correspond surprisingly well to the building blocks of the existing INQUIRE framework [17]. On a conceptual level, our results support the defined quality dimensions and the way they span across the different study stages, as presented in the INQUIRE framework. How-ever, variation was found when comparing the CT quality promoters in both quality concepts. In the INQUIRE framework, the CT quality promoters were limited to \"Infrastructure\" and \"Sus-Manuscript I 39 tainability/Education\", while next to theme \"Sustainability/Education\" was thereby classified under \"Partnership\" in our concept, whereas \"Quality system\", \"Operational excellence\", and parts of \"Partnership\" could be allocated to \"Infrastructure\" in the INQUIRE framework. Uniquely, \"Context adapta-tion\" is a completely new concept that is not reflected in the INQUIRE framework. However, this gap can be explained since the authors of the INQUIRE framework explicitly stated that they did not consider societal aspects and beliefs [16], which are central in our element of \"Context adaptation\". When considering the frequency of CT quality elements mentioned per stakeholder group in the one-sentence CT quality definitions, the proportions of monitors mentioning adherence, and sponsors mentioning data integrity as well as participant safety and rights were highest. Investigators mostly mentioned scientific soundness. However, the proportions per element addressed by investigators were distributed more evenly. Overall, the different stakeholder groups tended to focus on the quality aspects most important for their own role. In the case of sponsors, their particular focus on data integrity as well as participant safety and rights might also well be rooted in a perception of CT quality which is influenced by existing guidelines that use exactly these two broad (!) terms to describe what should be aimed for in CTs [3, 12]. Awareness about the divergence between the stakeholder groups may promote effective co-operation. Focusing on RLS-specific factors with potential influence on CT quality, the resulting themes were considered CT quality promoters and could be categorised under \"Context adaptation\", \"Infrastructure\", and \"Partnership\". These themes reflect aspects frequently discussed in the literature. However, existing literature addressed these aspects mainly from the perspective of ethics [24, 25], ICH-GCP applicability [2, 26, 27], or lessons learned when implementing specific studies in specific regions in SSA [28-30]. In contrast, our study was transnational and strictly oriented towards associations with CT quality, which could but did not necessarily have to overlap with these perspectives. We are aware of one other study focusing on quality indi-cators for CTs in RLS [31]. However, the quality indicator list was restricted to CT implemen-tation rather than the entire CT scope. When assessing a potential complementary introduction of RLS-specific themes into the IN-QUIRE framework, there were significant overlaps, indicating that the INQUIRE framework is a very comprehensive tool, even for RLS. Overlaps mainly concerned \"Infrastructure\" and \"Partnership\", since \"Context adaptation\" was not addressed. Still, two aspects should be Manuscript I 40 highlighted that need to be considered in addition to the framework in order to be more inclu-sive towards RLS: 1) Under \"Infrastructure\": Emphasis on clearly communicating potential in-frastructural disadvantages and their impact on timelines and, ultimately, the quality of CTs to funders, sponsors, and auditors. 2) Under \"Sustainability/Education\": Prevention of potential exploitation of research populations and workforce in LMICs by following specific ethical frameworks (e.g., The benchmarks of ethical research in developing countries [25], and Good collaborative practice: reforming capacity building governance of international health research partnerships [32]). As final amendment, we recommend adding 3) \"Context adaptation\" as an additional CT quality promoter to the INQUIRE framework. An aspect worth exploring in more detail for an appropriate representation in CT concepts was the distinction or similarity of community engagement versus the engagement of patient rep-resentatives. A recent study has shown that there are overlaps but also clear distinctions be-tween both notions [33]. However, in the interviews, it was not clear to what extent these concepts were distinguished or combined under one of the respective terms. Furthermore, it was suggested that the term \"patient representative\" could be discriminative or exclusive to-wards research involving healthy populations (e.g., vaccine research). 2.6.1 Strengths and limitations This study has some limitations: We focused on the region of SSA, however, the results may not be transferable to all of SSA or RLS outside SSA. Also, we focused only on investigators, sponsors, and monitors without including other CT stakeholders' perspectives, such as partic-ipants, ethics committees, funders, and regulatory authorities. Therefore, further research, in-cluding different stakeholder groups and regions, may offer new insights. Moreover, with our initial sampling strategy using the ICTRP we intended to reach stakehold-ers independently from each other to maintain confidentiality. However, based on CT regis-ters, mainly investigators and fewer sponsors and monitors could be identified and contacted directly. The overall participation rate remained low, and the following reasons may have con-tributed to this: Compared to surveys, interviews take much longer, which may have influenced the interest in participation; interviews also require a smaller number of participants, which may have reduced the pressure to participate. In addition, the contacts in the database could be outdated. Therefore, we decided to recruit more participants additionally via the snowball method, whereby a particular selection bias (i.e., personal relationship among interviewees) could hardly be avoided. However, in order to remain as independent as possible, we did not only approach known contacts, but also generated new contacts at conferences. Manuscript I 41 Further, we intended to increase generalisability by targeting many countries in SSA. which limited us in conducting interviews in person, possibly carrying over this distance into the in-terview atmosphere. However, since the interviewees were often participating in international research, they were used to the idea of communicating virtually. Also, the topics addressed were not personal, increasing the acceptability of this method. Talking about quality may have also been perceived as a \"testing\" situation by some participants. We tried to prevent this sentiment by addressing it upfront in the information sheet. Due to the limited time and budget, we were not able to seek feedback from the interview participants on the interview transcripts and the results. Also, given that many interviews were conducted remotely, we were not able to verify if other persons may have been present in the background during interviews, which may have influenced the responses. The methodology was qualitative; hence, numerical descriptions should be considered with caution. We also acknowledge that the interviewees' perspectives may be personal and not generalisable. However, our aim was to look for overarching CT quality aspects and we man-aged to involve stakeholders with extensive experience, often in several CTs and countries in SSA. Therefore, we believe that the methodology was suitable to produce a usable initial CT quality concept incorporating the perspective from RLS. Nevertheless, the concept could ben-efit from further research aimed at broader agreement, including transferability to other RLS, transferability to high-income countries, and the inclusion of participant and external feedback. Finally, our specific methodological approach maintains data trustworthiness by securing the following quality label: this research measures what it should measure (validity); it reproduces reliable results if it will be repeated (reliability); it is objective in the sense that no unwanted influences are exerted by involved persons (objectivity). 2.7 Conclusions A clear overview of quality components emerged from interviews with investigators, sponsors, and monitors with CT experience in SSA. These components form a CT Quality Concept that, in contrast to the conventional two-dimensional quality standard of the ICH-GCP (R1 & R2), which focuses primarily on scientific and ethical requirements, additionally emphasises \"CT quality-promoting factors\" as a CT quality component. Our results suggest that considering CT quality-promoting factors in the definition of CT quality can lead to a more adequate balance of quality management activities and thus a more effi-cient and successful CT conduct. This finding is in line with the existing INQUIRE framework, Manuscript I 42 which also represents a multidimensional quality concept and includes the component of qual-ity promoters [17]. Consequently, our results underline that future CT guidelines should not only be founded on two-dimensional but on multidimensional quality concepts, including scientific, ethical, and quality-promoting aspects. We recommend this approach to be understood as \"Comprehen-sive Quality Management (CQM)\". CQM could be considered in the ongoing revision (R3) of the ICH-GCP E6 guideline and/or the current draft of the ICH-E8 (R1) guideline and discussed as a basis for the identification of \"Critical to Quality Factors\" [11-13], enabling a true risk-based approach to CT planning, implementation and oversight. Insights from the SSA perspective suggested that important considerations in RLS are primar-ily categorised under the CT quality-promoting factors. Hence, when using a traditional two-dimensional quality standard as a basis to manage and assess CT quality, these considera-tions are neglected, potentially affecting the CT quality and efficiency. Furthermore, RLS-specific aspects resulted in an additional promoter, Context adaptation, as well as additions to the existing promoters in the INQUIRE framework. Therefore, we open the discussion to include the following points in the INQUIRE Framework to be inclusive towards critical reflections in CTs conducted in LMICs: 1) Addressing potential infrastructural disad-vantages and their impact on timelines and, ultimately, the quality of CTs to funders, sponsors, and auditors. 2) Preventing potential exploitation of research populations and workforce in LMICs by following specific ethical frameworks (e.g., The benchmarks of ethical research in developing countries, Good collaborative practice: reforming capacity building governance of international health research partnerships). 3) Adding \"Context adaptation\" as an additional CT quality promoter category, including reflections on the populations' socio-economic, as well as cultural and regional aspects. However, these suggestions are based on exploratory qualitative research. Therefore, they should not be considered exhaustive and need to be validated in further studies. 2.8 Acknowledgement Our acknowledgements go to Eric Huber (Department of Medicine, Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland) who facilitated a major part of the funding (EDCTP) for this study in the framework of the PZQ4PSAC project.

In countries with high rates of underage mothers, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, this lack of guidance may affect the rights of potential paediatric participants already bearing increased vulnerability. It can also influence the recruit-ment and generalisability of the research. We provide evidence and discuss informed consent management in such cases to inform best practice. 3.1.2 Materials and Methods We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar for articles pub-lished up to March 2019. In total, 4382 articles were screened, of which 16 met our inclusion criteria. Studies addressing informed consent in clinical trials involving children with minor parents in sub-Saharan Africa were included. We performed descriptive and qualitative frame-work analyses. The review was registered in PROSPERO: CRD42018074220. 3.1.3 Results Various informed consent approaches were reported. Articles supporting individual consent by minor parents based on emancipation or \"mature minor\" status lacked evidence in the con-text of research. National laws on medical care guided consent instead. When no laws or guidance existed an interpretation of the local decision-making culture, including community engagement and collaboration with local ethics committees, defined the informed consent ap-proach. 3.1.4 Conclusions The review emphasises that the implementation of informed consent for children with minor parents may be variable and hampered by absent or ambiguous clinical trial regulations, as well as divergent local realities. It may further be influenced by the research area and study-specific risks. Clear guidance is required to help address these challenges proactively in clin-ical trial planning. We provided a set of questions to be considered in the development of an ethically acceptable informed consent approach and proposed information that should be in-tegrated into international clinical trial guidelines. Manuscript II 48 3.2 Introduction Enrolment of children into clinical trials (CTs) is mandatory to enable the development of new medicines for this population [1]. Infectious diseases and malnutrition remain essential factors affecting childhood mortality, with around 50% of all cases occurring in Africa [2-4]. Compared to Europe or the USA, a higher proportion of CTs conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) involve children [5, 6]. Adolescent birth rates in SSA countries are also among the highest worldwide [7], increasing the likelihood that research staff might have to deal with the ethical challenge of obtaining valid informed consent (IC) for infant participation from minor parents. International guidelines on the conduct of CTs state that by being recognised as \"emanci-pated\" or \"mature minors\" through marriage, parenthood, etc. [8, 9], adolescents may be al-lowed to consent autonomously. However, it remains unclear whether autonomous consent refers only to adolescent's own research participation or whether such minors may consent independently for their child as well. Further specifications regarding the \"emancipated\" or \"mature minors\" status are subject to national provisions [8-10]. In the UK and the USA, professional guidelines recognise that minor parents can be responsible for medical decision-making for their children if they are consid-ered competent. Nevertheless, these guidelines lack strict criteria or principles defining such competence in relation to minor parents and its applicability to clinical trials [11, 12]. In some SSA countries, such as Kenya, guidelines may be in place (e.g., a national CT regu-lation or institutional guidance for the conduct of CTs) determining whether minor parents may consent for their children [10, 13]. However, such guidance may be missing, unclear, or difficult to source in other SSA countries. Even when concepts for \"emancipated\" or \"mature minors\" exist in general national legislations or research specific guidelines, their transferability to the context of CTs and the consent for children of minors often remain unspecified [14]. In addition, social and cultural norms may differ from country to country posing challenges for researchers in the development and implementation of IC procedures [10, 15]. Considerable efforts in the past decades sought to improve quality standards in global paedi-atric research, including strengthening recommendations on IC practices [16-18]. However, formal international guidance on implementing an ethically acceptable approach to the IC pro-cess for children with minor parents in various CT contexts is still lacking. There is a paramount need for best practices on IC, which ensure adequate protection while maintaining the option to enrol children under such circumstances. Manuscript II 49 The objective of this study was to address this gap by mapping the reported approaches to IC in paediatric CTs involving minor parents in SSA as identified through a systematic literature review. 3.3 Materials and methods This review followed the PRISMA 2009 statement (Appendix 6.9, Table S6) [19] in the PROSPERO database (CRD42018074220) [20]. 3.3.1 Eligibility criteria and screening We exported all search results to a reference management software (Endnote X7). After re-moving duplicates, we created an MS Excel table capturing selected information from the ex-tracted literature (Author, Year, Journal/Publisher, Title, Abstract, Keywords, ISBN/ISSN, DOI, and URL). Two independent reviewers (ADP and DOB) received a copy of the excel sheet and first screened articles based on title and abstract according to predefined eligibility criteria (Box 2). Box 2: Eligibility criteria Inclusion criteria Including any type of study, if relating to all of the following four key elements: - Informed consent procedure (proxy decision-maker, autonomous consent, assent, preterm consent) - Clinical trials (drug trials, vaccine trials, diagnostic trials, medical device trials, surgical trials, emergency research trials, nutritional supplementation trials) - Children as a. Participants (neonates, infants, toddlers, small children) with the age of 0.0-4.9 years b. Minor parents (adolescents, teenagers, mature minors, emancipated minors) with the age of 12.0-17.9 years - Sub-Saharan Africa (or global or international relevance, including sub-Saharan Africa) Exclusion criteria Excluding any type of study, if relating to: - Adults - Children with the age of 5.0-11.9 years - Vulnerable participants in the broader sense (individuals with disabilities, geriatric subjects, ethnic minorities, mi-grants, etc.) - Developed countries only - Informed consent procedure in other than clinical trials: Observational studies (with and without blood samples), quality of life studies, preventive interventions (health care/health behaviour/immunisation) Reproductive health care (HIV testing, abortion, fertilisation, contraception, adoption, pregnancy, cir-cumcision/sterilisation, etc.) Biobanking, organ donation, blood transfusion Genetic testing, new-born screening Diverse treatments Euthanasia/end-of-life decision-making Surgery (as treatment) Emergency treatment/treatment of serious illnesses Nutritional studies, if only addressing natural behaviour, such as breastfeeding If it is a study report using blood samples from a primary clinical trial - Other informed consent topics, such as addressing exclusively: Manuscript II 50 Informed consent understanding Informed consent return rates Informed consent confidentiality issues - Other language than English and French When eligibility was unclear based on title and abstract, available full-texts were screened. The interrater reliability was moderate (Cohen's Kappa = 0.47) for the initial screening and substantial (Cohen's Kappa = 0.71) for the update search screening [21]. Disagreements between reviewers were mostly systematic and were all resolved in several rounds of discus-sion. One reviewer (ADP) performed the full-text assessment and a second reviewer (DOB) verified a random sample of 10 %. Included papers' full-text was screened systematically look-ing for minor parents using pre-defined search terms (Box 3).

We used search terms related to the elements of IC, decision-making, CTs, minors, and SSA (Box 4). Reference lists of included articles were also screened. We performed the initial search in July 2017 (Appendix 6.10, Table S7) and updated it in March 2019 based on a reviewed search strategy by a medical librarian. The changes applied to the search strategy included: improving the combination structure of registered and Manuscript II 51 free-text terms, removing language filters, removing animal studies, instead of limiting to hu-mans, removing redundancies (term combinations were removed as single terms already cov-ered them), complementing child MeSH and free text terms, as well as adding the terms \"re-search\", \"placebo\", and all sub-Saharan African countries. Information on search strategies for all other databases can be found in the Supporting information (Appendix 6.10, Table S7). No protocol was published for this review. Box 4: Search strategy (updated search) Key elements Informed consent AND minors AND decision-making AND clinical trials AND sub-Saharan Africa PubMed (\"Informed OR OR South of the Sahara\"[mesh]) NOT (animals[mh] NOT humans[mh]) We requested inaccessible articles from different libraries but did not contact authors. Articles and conference abstracts potentially relating to our topic, but for which a determination of eligibility was impossible without full-text access, were listed in the Supporting information (Appendix 6.11, Table S8). Books were rarely accessible and, therefore, completely excluded Manuscript II 52 from the analysis. When available information on a book (accessible or inaccessible) sug-gested that it might relate to our search, the book was also listed in the Supporting information (Appendix 6.11, Table S8). We did not limit our review to a particular study type and searched for any publication containing information about IC by minor parents in paediatric CTs con-ducted in SSA. 3.3.3 Data extraction and analysis For the included articles, we extracted characteristic information on study type and proce-dures, country, health conditions, and the medical interventions addressed. We performed a descriptive and qualitative framework analysis using MAXQDA (VERBI GmbH) and MS Excel [22]. 3.3.4 Critical appraisal of studies Due to the information and study types identified in this review, no conventional assessment of bias risk or quality appraisal was applicable. We addressed the quality of the information descriptively in the results by reviewing the source and comprehensiveness of the imple-mented and recommended IC approaches, and did not exclude articles based on type or qual-ity. 3.4 Results We initially identified 3346 articles from the literature search (Figure 3). After removing dupli-cates (n=414), we screened the titles and abstracts of 2932 articles, and when eligibility re-mained unclear, we screened the full-text. 2501 articles were excluded, and the full-text of 431 was assessed, resulting in 9 articles included in the analysis. Our search update found 1450 additional articles from which seven were eligible, amounting to a total of 16 articles. The reasons for exclusion were: out of scope, emancipated/mature minors consenting for them-selves, not their children, duplicates, languages other than English and French, master theses, PowerPoint presentations, books, and non-accessible full-texts of conference abstracts and papers. Manuscript II 53 Figure 3: Study-selection flow diagram aThe total number comes from three combined Google Scholar searches. bOut of scope: not addressing informed consent, not addressing SSA, not addressing children < 5, not addressing clinical trials, not addressing minor parents, not clear if addressing minor parents. cA list of these books/papers/conference abstracts can be found in the Supporting information (Appendix 6.11, Table S8). dIf information about the key elements of the search lacked in the abstract or title, articles' full text was also screened using keywords (Box 3). eFull-text assessment was done based on a secondary screening using keywords relating specifically to minor parents (Box 3). The 16 identified articles included various study types (Table 6) categorised into: case studies (n=4) [23-26], one of which included a review [25], reviews of national legislations and ethical discussions (n=4) [27-30], reviews of IC challenges countries (Senegal, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Kenya, Botswana, South Africa, and Uganda), while the others related to SSA, low- and middle-income countries, or global CTs in general. Infectious diseases were the most prevalent health conditions, and vaccines were the most frequently discussed medical intervention. Five articles were secondary publications of CT experiences [23-26, 37] and described the IC approach for children with minor parents applied in specific CTs [39-43]. Five further articles discussed the national legislation concerning IC Manuscript II 54 requirements, including in the case of minor parents [27-30, 38]. The remaining articles men-tioned IC by minor parents among several ethical challenges faced in clinical research con-ducted in resource-limited countries [31-36].

One article [31] was a review, which included another of the included articles [25]. We consid-ered it for analysis only when it provided additional information. We systematically extracted information on minor parents according to six themes: The fre-quency and age of these parents, the IC approach and the related references, IC challenges, and recommendations affecting the IC approach (Table 7). Manuscript II 56 Table 7: Framework of themes concerning minor parents # Study Frequency of minor parents Age of minor parents (years) IC approach with minor parents References linked to the IC ap-proach with minor parents Challenges addressed concern-ing IC with minor parents Recommendations with potential influence on the IC approach with minor parents 1 Diallo et al. (2003) [23] 2 (1.4%) of CT partici-pants had a minor mother 15 and 16 IC provided by minor mothers. However, the father or paternal grandparents were included in the information process and contrib-uted to decision-making. Only with the mother's authorisation was the child included. The primary CT report states \"oral informed consent was obtained from all mothers of the study in-fants\" [42]. No source referenced. The child's father and grandparents did not consider the minor mothers as mature enough to decide on the research participation of children. The practicability of this IC ap-proach is, therefore, questionable. The study was conducted without an ethical approval: A local EC/IRB did not exist, and an EC in the Sponsor's country was not con-sulted as no EC had experience with research in resource-limited countries; the local Ministry of Health approved the protocol. No recommendation provided. 2 N'Goran et al. (2019) [24] Unspecified < 21 IC not provided by minor mothers. Although married minors are con-sidered emancipated under local law, they could not provide consent for their children, as decided by the national ethics committee. How-ever, it remains unclear to what ex-tent the minor parent participated in decision-making (e.g., assent). No CT report published yet. The reference provided for the Ivory Coast minority law (1970) [44] addresses emancipation of mi-nors through marriage, however, it does not explicitly refer to emanci-pated minor's right to consent for their child's participation in CTs. No clear interpretation of the rights afforded by the \"emancipated\" sta-tus for minors versus the legal age of majority was provided in the lo-cal law. The EC decided that emancipated minors could not con-sent. Involving fieldworkers with knowledge of the local population could facilitate the study recruit-ment. Revision of the ICH-GCP guide-lines to reflect the flexibility and al-low for adaptation to local settings. 3 Ott et al. (2019) [25] 211 (3%) of CT partici-pants had a minor par-ent < 18 IC was first provided by minor par-ents alone. During the CT, the IC procedure changed, and an addi-tional consent was required by ei-ther the other parent (if an adult), or by the grandparents. Re-con-sent by the minor parent alone was sought once the age of majority was reached. No source referenced. No clear local laws or guidance on the IC process in the case of minor parents existed. The study was reviewed and ap-proved by national public health authorities and a local EC, but after a routine review, the EC changed its requirements for the IC ap-proach. The EC took a decision based on the local cultural norm. The authors conducted a review of relevant literature and provided de-tailed recommendations: Involve local institutions, ethics commit-tees, and community stakeholders proactively in the definition of the IC process, respect the minor par-ents and involve them in decision-making, include another decision-Manuscript II 57 The primary CT report (conducted in Latin America) addresses minor parents [43]. making party depending on cultural context and the minor's capacity, implement a careful, adapted con-sent process, mitigate additional vulnerabilities of children of minor parents, and community engage-ment for a better understanding of the local context. 4 Preziosi et al. (1997) [26] 85 (4.1%) of CT partici-pants had a minor mother < 18 IC provided by minor mothers. The IC is explicitly considered valid. The primary CT report states \"...and those whose parents agreed were vaccinated\" [41]. No source referenced. No challenges mentioned. As local EC/IRB did not exist, the protocol was reviewed and ap-proved only abroad by an EC affili-ated with the collaborative study and the Human Subjects IRB of the CDC. Clinical trials in resource-limited countries should be reviewed by a sponsor's EC (if external) and a lo-cal one. Subsequent studies had, therefore, involved locally estab-lished \"ad hoc\" committees. 5 Slack and Strode (2016) [27] Unspecified < 18 IC should not be provided by minor mothers. When the mother is under the age of 18, her mother (the child's grandmother) will be the child's guardian. There is no information on whether the marital status of minor mothers makes a difference to this ap-proach and how to handle IC when minor mothers have lost the sup-port of their parents (as mentioned in earlier articles by the same au-thors, see Strode & Slack 2011, 2014). The sources refer to South African CT regulations (2013) [45] and a position paper about guidelines for the involvement of adolescents in research [46]. Neither source con-firms the IC approach explicitly. The South African CT regulations generally state that \"any IC given to the research must be in line with public policy\" and non-therapeutic research with minors needs addi-tional ministerial consent. The posi-tion paper for research with adoles-cents states that mature or emanci-pated minors (married or in military service) can consent for them-selves. It also states that \"other mi-nors authorised to consent may in-clude those who are parents\". But it does not explicitly address IC for the CT participation of their chil-dren. There are no specific challenges mentioned. The authors provide recommenda-tions aimed at researchers who want to implement parental/guard-ian consent, which is distinguished from caregiver consent. Its implica-tion on IC by minor parents is not addressed. 6 Strode et al. (2014) [28] Unspecified < 18 The legal competency of a married or unmarried, underage mother to consent is not evident (Strode and The source referenced [47] does not explicitly address minor parents consenting to CT participation of A law reform (Section 71 of the Na-tional Health Act) limits proxy con-sent to parents or legal guardians, The authors criticise the new re-strictive legislation to be reducing adolescents' access to research Manuscript II 58 Slack 2011 provide more infor-mation). It is vaguely suggested that IC can be provided by minor mothers if they are married. The consent right in the case of un-married minor mothers who have lost the support of their parents ap-pears uncertain. Apparently, un-married minor mothers used to consent as caregivers (especially when they had lost the support of their parents). As such caregiver consent is not accepted anymore according to a reform of the Na-tional Health Act; children of such mothers might be excluded from future research. their children. The IC approach seems to be based on a conclusion by the authors that the restriction of the law around adolescent partici-pation in research will affect chil-dren of minor mothers who lost the support of their parents and subse-quently lose their right to consent as caregivers. excluding IC by caregivers. The au-thors highlight that \"this principle will also apply to mothers under the age of 18 who have lost parental support...\" participation while promoting an IC approach that is adapted to the re-search setting. 7 Strode and Slack (2011) [29] Unspecified < 18 IC provided by minor mothers if they are married. IC provided by maternal grandmothers if the minor mothers are unmarried and the fa-ther of the child has no parental re-sponsibilities and rights. The South African Children's Act (2005) [48] is clear about the minor mothers' guardian being also the guardian of the minor mother's child when she is unmarried (and in case the father has not guardi-anship rights). According to a legal review of the South African law [49], minor mothers are recognised as their child's guardians once they are married. This source was inac-cessible, and the statement could not be confirmed. Strode and Slack also state that as guardians, mar-ried minor mothers can then con-sent to \"all forms of research\" on behalf of their child. This is the au-thors' interpretation, as no source is referenced. The South African Children's Act (2005), does not ex-plicitly state that this IC regulation also relates to research participa-tion. Local laws (Children's Act and the National Health Act) and ethical guidance are inconsistent concern-ing children's capacity to consent to research as well as adults' au-thority to provide proxy consent. Based on a review of South African legislation, the authors conclude that \"a biological mother, as the child's legal guardian, has the au-thority to consent to all forms of health research on behalf of the child as long as she is 18 years or older, or under the age of 18 and married.\" Manuscript II 59 8 van Wyk (2003) [30] Unspecified < 21 (at time of study, currently: < 18) Minor parents above 14 may pro-vide consent for therapeutic re-search. Minors over 18 may also consent for non-therapeutic research (pre-ventive HIV vaccine trials are con-sidered non-therapeutic research). Proxy consent in non-therapeutic research is, however, limited by re-quiring consent by a legally author-ised representative, assent by the participant and no more than negli-gible research risk (preventive HIV vaccine trials are considered more than negligible risk). The South African Child Care Act [50] confirms that: 1) Minors over 14 may consent for themselves and their children for \"any medical treatment\". The au-thors interpret medical treatment as interventions that benefit the in-dividual patients and, therefore, ex-tend the definition to \"medical re-search of therapeutic nature\". 2) Minors over 18 may consent for \"any type of operation. \" The Au-thors extend this to cover also non-therapeutic research. However, consent for their children is not ex-plicitly mentioned. (The referenced law is outdated and was replaced by the South Af-rican Children's Act No 38 of 2005 in 2007 [48]) Under South African legislation, there is no consistent approach re-garding the minor persons' capac-ity to consent to research. There are inconsistent definitions of minors in law: e.g., the age of majority is reached at 21, but chil-dren are defined as minors under the age of 18. Restrictions for proxy consent for non-therapeutic research bearing a more than negligible risk result in a prohibition to include infants in such research. The authors advise that research enrolment in non-therapeutic trials bearing more than negligible risk should be restricted to participants above the age of 21. 9 Colom and Rohloff (2018) [31] Unspecified Unspecified The study addressing minor par-ents in this review refers to an in-cluded paper (see Ott et al. 2018). See Ott et al. 2018 See Ott et al. 2018 Local ethics committees are ex-pected to play a substantial role in defining adaptive processes for IC. The community should be involved, and the local sociocultural context should be considered. 10 Idoko et al. (2016) [32] Unspecified < 18 IC provided by minor mothers. This approach is commonly allowed in most settings in Africa when the minor mothers are considered as mature or emancipated minors. However, some sponsors don't agree with this definition. There is no source referenced for the specific settings in Africa defin-ing IC by mature or emancipated minors. The authors state that there is \"considerable debate\" about the possibility of minor mothers to con-sent for themselves and their chil-dren in vaccine trials. It seems the issue is that some sponsors resist going along with local customs around this aspect. The issues perceived by sponsors concerning minor mothers being al-lowed to consent for research par-ticipation of their children in most settings in Africa when considered as mature or emancipated minors, Sponsors should give more consid-eration and leeway to the local cul-ture while ensuring that the chil-dren's rights are safeguarded. Regulatory authorities should be informed of the IC practice agreed upon by the sponsors and local re-searchers. Manuscript II 60 are due to \"legal reasons and may thus result in discrimination of this segment of the population.\" 11 Lema et al. (2009) [33] Unspecified Unspecified Not defining if IC by minor parents is acceptable for research. Only acknowledging the possibility of consent by minor mothers. How-ever, researchers faced the sce-nario when consent from mothers (not specified if adult) with legal guardianship was later withdrawn by fathers, challenging the mother's authority and the re-search team's decision not to con-sult fathers. Also, elders in the fam-ily may generally \"have to be con-sulted to give their nod before one can consent.\" No source referenced. Cultural norms (i.e., patri- or matri-lineal hierarchies) or a lack of legal clarification (e.g., individual paren-tal rights, marital status, variations in research and medical care) may complicate the IC requirements for women in general and impede them from being able to consent autonomously. The authors high-light the paradox that minor moth-ers may not be considered able to consent autonomously for their own research participation, while at the same time being considered the legal guardians of their children enabled to consent to medical care. Researchers should respect local social and cultural norms and val-ues to prevent conflicts with the lo-cal communities. The IC process should be evalu-ated individually for every CT to potentially detect specific issues. This process should be budgeted for. 12 Mamotte et al. (2010) [34] Unspecified Unspecified Not defining if IC by minor parents is acceptable. Only acknowledging that the case of minor parents is possible when obtaining proxy con-sent. No source referenced. Proxy consent in the case of minor parents may pose challenges. Proxy consent in the case of minor parents requires special considera-tion. 13 Ravinetto et al. (2010) [35] Unspecified Unspecified IC provided by minor mothers is accepted. The authors base this approach on the Guidelines of the Uganda National Council for Sci-ences and Technology, evaluating \"adulthood\" beyond age-depend-ence. The Ugandan research guideline [51] does not confirm this ap-proach. It states that emancipated minors (including minor parents) can consent for themselves, but it does not explicitly address IC for the CT participation of their chil-dren. The authors consider the issue of minor parents as \"more specific challenges\" in relation to IC validity. The decision whether minor par-ents are allowed to consent needs to balance social, cultural and legal factors. The definition of \"adult-hood\" should be based on more than just a person's age. The authors recommend involving social scientists and anthropologist in the development of effective, rel-evant, and ethical research and IC tools. Manuscript II 61 14 van Hoog (2013) [36] Unspecified < 18 (mostly, but global range 14-21) IC provided by minor mothers for their children is recorded as ac-cepted by most countries as these mothers are considered legally ma-ture minors. The source referenced [52] for this approach is not clear. It states that minor parents can be considered mature minors and consent for their own CT participation. It is not explicitly addressing CT participa-tion of their children. Also, the ap-proach is based on a personal communication concerning re-search in the USA. The authors highlight that parental consent could be a barrier to re-search participation of young peo-ple. Legal barriers need to be over-come, and youth organisations should be involved. Research advi-sory boards should also reflect and represent the specific target popu-lation. The IC process should be adapted to the needs of the participants or parents. 15 Angwenyi et al. (2014) [37] Unspecified 16-17 No explicit statement on who gave informed consent in the case of mi-nor parents. The primary CT report states \"Written informed consent was obtained from the children's parents or guardians\" [40]. No source referenced. No challenges mentioned. No recommendation provided. 16 Kasule (2013) [38] Unspecified < 21 (at time of study, currently: < 18) IC might theoretically be provided by minor parents if considered as mature minors. However, due to a lack of clear guidance, the IC was not provided by minor parents. A parent below the age of majority needed to be accompanied by an adult. It remains unclear to what extent the minor parent was en-rolled in decision-making (e.g., as-sent). The reference provided for mature minors did not address minor par-ents [53]. The Botswana Children's Act (2009) [54] does not explicitly relate to emancipated/mature mi-nors or IC for CT participation of their children. Botswana does not have a national law on research with children, or a law on the concept of 'mature' or 'emancipated minors'. Also, various legal acts in Bot-swana contain different concepts of 'child', 'parent', and 'guardianship' and different laws state different ages for childhood. (the Children's Act now states clearly that when-ever there is a conflict between the Children's Act and other legisla-tion/regulation, then the Children's Act has to be considered unless it would harm the child). Due to a lack of clear guidance, IC was sought from representatives of the minor parents. Clear research guidance for the le-gal and cultural context of Bot-swana is needed.

Manuscript II 62 Three of the articles relating to specific CTs mentioned explicitly the number of children with minor parents ranging from 1.4 to 4.1% [23, 25, 26]. The legal age of majority was 18 in most countries, except for C\u00f4te d'Ivoire where it was 21 (Botswana and South Africa had recently changed from 21 to 18) [45, 55]. One article highlighted that the legal age of majority might range from 14 to 21 globally [36]. In five articles, minor parents were allowed to consent for research participation of their chil-dren [23, 26, 32, 35, 36]. In four articles, consent by minor parents was denied [24, 25, 27, 38]. One of these articles reported that researchers first allowed minor parents to consent for the CT, but later reconsidered their procedure, as the ethics committee changed its policy during the course of the CT [25]. Three other articles proposed conditional approaches to consent by minor parents, e.g., depending on the research risk or the marital status of the mothers [28-30], and two more articles simply acknowledged that the case of minor parents is possible and may pose challenges [33, 34]. One article involved a CT including children of minor parents, however, it did not report any details on the IC approach [37]. A majority (n=11) of articles addressed challenges in designing an appropriate IC approach for CTs involving children with minor parents [23-25, 29, 30, 32-36, 38]. Most of these articles highlighted a lack of or inconsistency in local laws and guidance on the rights of minors in relation to clinical research [24, 25, 29, 30, 32, 33, 38]. A further challenge addressed in two older articles was a lack of local ethical review, as no local ethics committee existed at that time [23, 26]. Hence, one study was only reviewed by a foreign ethics committee and IRB [26], while the other was additionally submitted to the local ministry of health [23]. In the latter study, researchers experienced challenges when asking minor mothers to provide formal consent, as families viewed these mothers as immature; this resulted in involving the grandparents or fathers in the decision-making [23]. Two further articles addressed another challenge posed by a South African law reform restricting consent for children to adult parents and legal guard-ians, excluding other caregivers [27, 28]. This reform resulted in a specific barrier to recruiting children whose parents were minors and had lost the support of their parents [28]. Several articles provided specific references to IC approaches proposed for children with mi-nor parents, such as four national laws on children's rights [44, 48, 50, 54], one national re-search regulation [45], one national research guideline [51], and four position papers on chil-dren's rights in research [46, 47, 52, 53]. One source referred to a legal review inaccessible for our study [49]. Based on these references, none of the applied or proposed IC approaches reported in the initial articles could be confirmed as mandatory or an established standard of practice. Some references mentioned conditions for adolescents' autonomous consent for their own research participation without explicitly invoking their children [44, 46, 51, 52]. The Manuscript II 63 only reference directly referring to consent approaches for children of minor parents was the South African Children's Act (and its predecessor, the South African Child Care Act) [48, 50]. However, none of the national laws on children's rights (including the South African ones) addressed clinical research [44, 48, 50, 54]. Overall, only two articles provided comprehensive recommendations on IC for CT participation of children with minor parents [25, 29], as presented in detail in Table 3. One of these articles based the IC approach on a review and discussion of national legislation of children's rights [29]. The other one addressed ethical considerations for the development of an IC approach for children of minor parents based on a review of relevant literature and guidelines, including consensus by an international expert panel [25]. Other articles offered general recommendations concerning IC implementation in SSA [24, 26-28, 31-33, 35, 36, 38]. These involved a consideration for the local context and norms [24, 28, 32, 33, 35], the capacity of local ethics committees and regulatory authorities [31, 32], the availability of context-adapted research guidelines and laws [27, 38], and the representation of target populations in research advisory boards [36]. Finally, we provide an overview of additional challenges for IC in research in SSA (Table 8) mentioned across the 16 articles. These are general considerations, which may benefit the development of an appropriate IC approach for CTs involving children with minor parents in resource-limited settings (RLS). Table 8: Additional considerations for informed consent in sub-Saharan African research Theme Issue Additional vul-nerabilities of children with mi-nor parents - Increased poverty (including less access to health care, less educated parents) - Interpersonal complications through possible child marriage - Greater power differential between the minor parent and the researcher - Less decision-making experience - Impact of stressful conditions (child suffering from a chronic disease) on decision-making capacity Research risk - Consent requirements may vary according to the research risk - Research with minimal risk/a minor increase over minimal risk may allow for consent from caregivers - Increased risk research requires consent by one or both parents or legal guardians Legal aspects - Many resource-limited countries experience a cultural transition - Variable laws across and within countries (e.g., Common Law and Customary Law) - The population may lack legal records, such as birth certificates and identification documents IRB/EC Approval - ECs need to know relevant international and national regulations - The review by the ECs varies from country to country - Local laws and guidelines have to be considered - When there is no law or guidance, relying on the decision by the ECs according to their ethical norms - Studies sponsored from abroad should undergo dual review by local ECs and ECs abroad Community stakeholder - Community engagement and pre-trial design efforts may be needed to set-up research activities - Initial consent from local community stakeholders, leaders, or other key decision-makers may be needed Manuscript II 64 Decision-making culture - Communal, family and/or individual consent may be the norm - Consultation with spouses or close family members may be needed - Variable norms across and within countries (e.g., rural and urban areas) Gender dynam-ics - Mothers and fathers may have different decision-making authority - Determinations of decision-making authority may depend on the social structure (i.e., patri- or matrilin-eal) - Mothers may have to consult their husbands, parents, or other family members (e.g., maternal uncles) - Silent refusals by delaying research procedures are possible - Biological fathers may not automatically also be the legal guardians of their children - The marital status for both men and women may be criteria for the assignment of parental authority Assent - The ability to assent depends on a child's maturity and is recognised at different ages in various coun-tries - This concept of shared decision-making may not be consistent with local norms Autonomous consent by ado-lescents - The balance of adolescents' privacy needs and the demand for parental consent poses difficulties - Parental consent may represent an obstacle to adolescent research participation (e.g., in sexual health research due to stigmatisation) - Minors may be allowed to consent for themselves when they are considered mature or emancipated Caregivers vs le-gal guardians - Unclear if consent by a caregiver is acceptable in some countries and under what circumstances - The effort required to distinguish between parents, legal guardians, and caregivers is unclear - Due to a lack of legal records, special precautions may be required, such as village chiefs confirming the identity of people Orphans - Orphans are increasingly recognised as a special research population in resource-limited countries in terms of HIV risk and transmission - There is an ambiguity in defining the right decision-maker in the case of orphans and their children (e.g., consent by a High Court) - Ambiguity may lead to the exclusion of orphans and their children from research for convenience rea-sons IRB, Institutional Review Board; EC, Ethics Committee. 3.5 Discussion This systematic literature review presents evidence on CT recruitment and IC practice for chil-dren with minor parents in SSA. Overall, our results show that researchers experienced the need to find a solution concerning IC when enrolling children with minor parents and were challenged by the lack of a specific regulation or guidance. A similar number of articles accepted or denied minor parents providing independent IC for their children and both approaches involved specific uncertainties. Becoming an emancipated or \"mature minor\" was the key argument promoting independent consent by minor parents [32, 35, 36]. When considering the referenced literature, however, we found this approach to lack legislative clarity and generalisability [44, 46, 51, 52]. First, the emancipation or \"mature minor\" status did not explicitly relate to clinical trials with children of minors. Instead, it related either to autonomous consent by adolescents for their own research participation or to medical care rather than research. Further, the conditions to reach emancipated or \"mature minor\" status, through marriage, parenthood, etc., vary across countries, as do the rights ensuing Manuscript II 65 from the respective status. In N'Goran et al., minor parents could be considered emancipated when married; however, they could not provide consent for their children's research participa-tion [24]. Lema et al. mention that minor parents may have the authority to consent for their children's medical care while not being considered mature enough to consent to their own research participation autonomously [33]. A recent position paper by the American Academy of Pediatrics confirms this ambiguity: All (US) states accept medical decision-making by minor parents for their children, without necessarily acknowledging minor parents as emancipated or mature to authorise their own medical care [12]. Another perspective is yet added by the Guidelines for Conduct of Clinical Trials in Kenya, which consider minor parents directly as \"emancipated minors\" able to consent for themselves and being explicitly allowed to consent to CT participation of their children [13]. These examples indicate that the legal status alone does not always equate to an adolescent's capacity for decision-making and emphasise the need for clear conditions establishing minor parents' competence to consent for themselves and their children. In studies where minor parents were not considered emancipated or competent to consent independently for their children, consent was provided by an adult proxy [24, 25, 38], which included the other parent (if an adult), grandparents, or legally authorised representatives or guardians. This approach raises the problem of identifying appropriate decision-makers, a known issue for paediatric research in the SSA context [31]. It involves the additional consid-eration of gender dynamics, hierarchical family structures (e.g., matrilineal, or patrilineal), or shared versus individual decision-making within the family or community [31, 33, 35, 36, 38]. Also, formal identification of individuals accompanying children may pose problems, as people in RLS may lack birth certificates or identity documents [24, 27]. In one study, the village chief was therefore asked to confirm identities [24]. Ignoring local norms may affect the IC validity and, hence, the protection of CT participants and could result in a recruitment failure or sub-sequent consent withdrawal [33]. Therefore, community involvement in the development and approval of the IC approach before CT implementation is essential to address specific sce-narios upfront and find practical and acceptable solutions. CT participation risks may further influence the IC approach. Risks play a role in deciding whether one or both parents have to provide consent and at what age a person is capable of consenting. Earlier interpretations of South African laws restricted non-therapeutic trials bear-ing more than a negligible risk to participants above the age of 21 [30]. The research area may also have an influence, and in certain fields, such as HIV transmission prevention, additional consent by grandparents may pose a barrier to research participation of minor parents and their children, due to privacy reasons and fear of stigmatisation [36]. Hence, individual consent Manuscript II 66 by minor parents alone might be encouraged to improve access to such research. Independ-ent consent by minor mothers might also be encouraged in cases when children are typically accompanied by their mothers and health facilities are difficult to access [10, 23]. Requiring these mothers, when competent, to always consult their husbands or families before being able to consent, may be disruptive to the recruitment of these children. At the time when com-munities are informed about the CT, however, willingness to participate in the CT can also be discussed in advance, particularly in families where such a situation is expected. In the case of consent by adult proxies, included studies lacked information on the extent of minor parents' involvement in the IC process. Only one article mentioned explicitly how minor parents were consulted in parallel with the consent of an adult. It proposed that minor parents could first provide a co-consent and then re-consent independently when reaching majority during the CT [25]. This approach is supported by acknowledgements across literature in the past decade that minors should be involved in decision-making according to their develop-mental capacity [56, 57]. We further detected limited transparency for reported IC procedures for children of minor par-ents in primary CT publications. This is emphasised by the fact that we did not identify any primary CT publication addressing minor parents in our results. Five included articles, which were secondary studies on CT experiences, however, referenced primary CT publications. We reviewed these publications, and in three of them, we could not find any indication of the parents' ages, and the IC statement was limited as well [40-42]. Minor parents' involvement was only evident in the secondary studies' publications [23, 26, 37]. One of the three primary CT publications stated that \"oral IC was obtained from all mothers of the study infants\", and more information on minor mothers', parents' and husbands' participation in decision-making was reported as significant only in the secondary study [42]. The second primary CT publica-tion stated \"those whose parents agreed were vaccinated\" without mentioning that some of the consenting parents were minors [41]. The third primary CT publication provided the follow-ing statement: \"written IC was obtained from the children's parents or guardians\" [40]. It is debatable how much more information beyond such blanket statements should researchers report in primary CT publications to effectively describe the IC procedures applied, considering typical word limitations in publishing and the relevance of the topic in relation to other infor-mation provided in CT publications. Manuscript II 67 3.5.1 Strengths and limitations This review has some limitations. Information about minor parents was scarce and typically included as a tangential thought only. Hence, we additionally developed a full-text screening strategy to increase our screening efficiency (Box 3). This strategy may have led to overlook-ing some relevant terms and articles limited to these terms. We identified many articles, rep-resenting secondary studies based on primary CT publications, which sometimes included minor mothers. Most of these primary CT reports, however, did not figure in our search results independently, probably due to lacking specific links to standardised keywords. As many of those primary CT publications also lacked a reference, we systematically excluded them, ex-cept when including the secondary studies, then we also considered the information provided in the primary CT publications, if accessible. Further, we used Google Scholar to access also grey literature, such as dissertations, organ-isation reports, government publications, etc. The translated search, however, yielded more articles than Google Scholar was able to display, as it is limited to a maximum of 1000 articles [58]. We decided to include all accessible articles and ran two additional, very limited searches on Google Scholar to maximise the output of relevant publications under the given circum-stances. This also explains why the number of articles detected on Google Scholar, as pre-sented in the flow chart is larger than 1000. Also, we did not systematically search the supple-mentary files of articles, which may have contained information on minor parents. Moreover, the review clarifies that information about minor parents is typically published in secondary studies and in qualitative reports on CT experiences, and not in primary CT publi-cations. This suggested that IC information required in CT publications might be too brief to allow an adequate picture of ethical issues faced during the CT conduct and IC issues may be preferably addressed elsewhere (e.g., protocol, ethics committee review, supplementary files, or secondary article on CT challenges). Hence, future research could focus on identifying more details from screening CT protocols involving infants in SSA published in CT registries, as these may better reflect ethical considerations. However, technicalities on the identification of decision-makers may not be addressed in protocols either and may only become evident based on CT management manuals, standard operating procedures, or IC trackers, which are inaccessible to the public, if not specifically self-reported or requested. Despite available information on the subject being rare and the related challenges to detect such information, we consider this review valuable in supporting future CT conduct. With the help of an elaborate search strategy and the unlimited consideration of various study types, Manuscript II 68 we present a first overview of IC approaches applied for CT involving children with minor par-ents in SSA. We thereby raise evidence on the challenges faced in these situations and point to evidence-based solutions. 3.6 Conclusions This review highlights that there is no one-size-fits-all approach in handling IC in CTs with children of minor parents in SSA. The status of guidance is variable across countries and, frequently, clear conditions establishing minor parents' competence to consent for themselves and their children are missing. Nevertheless, challenges can be mitigated through increasing awareness about the IC approach and appropriate planning before CT implementation. Thereby, the following should be considered: 1) Is a local law available regarding emancipa-tion, or the \"mature minor\" status? 2) Does the law define whether and under what conditions minors are considered competent to consent on behalf of their children in a CT? Local laws often lack in the context of research, but when regulations on medical care exist, their provi-sions could also apply to research (see example by Strode and Slack (2011)), 3) Is there an existing official approach (e.g., in a national CT guideline or regulation, institutional guidance)? Did important stakeholders, including the ethics committee and the community approve the approach? Are the ministry of health, regulatory authorities, and local leaders aware of it? 4) Is the approach applicable under the individual circumstances of the CT, considering the local social and cultural context and study related risks? 5) When developing a new approach, have specific ethical considerations and practical challenges been addressed (see example pro-vided by Ott et.al 2018 and Table 8 of this article)? 6) Was the approach described or referred to in the study protocol and were possible practical challenges mitigated? 7) Was the possi-bility of minor parents addressed in the CT publication? We argue that special IC situations should be described in publications and, if this is not possible due to restrictions of word count, in an appendix to the publication. We further conclude that international CT guidelines, such as the ICH Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population E11 (R1), should be amended to include a general statement on the variability of IC for children of minor parents, e.g., \"National guidance on the IC for children must be adhered to; where they are missing or local conventions deviate from such guidance, the process must be described in the study protocol and be mentioned in scientific publications\".

However, particular specifications for exceptional cases, such as research in resource-limited countries, on rare diseases or patients unable to personally consent to participation are missing. This study aimed to examine the level of trans-parency regarding recruitment and informed consent approaches in publications of clinical trials recruiting children with minor parents in sub-Saharan Africa. We thereby focused partic-ularly on the transparency about consenting persons (i.e., proxy decision-makers) and as-sessed the need to expand reporting guidelines for such exceptional cases. 4.1.2 Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of a systematic review, searching multiple scientific da-tabases up to March 2019. Clinical trial publications addressing consent and potentially re-cruiting children with minor parents in sub-Saharan Africa were included. 44 of the in total 4,382 screened articles met our inclusion criteria. A descriptive analysis was performed. 4.1.3 Results None of the included articles provided full evidence on whether any recruited children had minor parents and how consent was obtained for them. Four proxy decision-maker types were identified (parents; parents or guardians; guardians; or caregivers), with further descriptions provided rarely and mostly in referenced clinical trial registrations or protocols. Also, terminol-ogy describing proxy decision-makers was often used inconsistently. 4.1.4 Conclusions Reporting the minimum maternal age alongside maternal data provided in baseline de-mographics can increase transparency on the recruitment of children with minor mothers. The CONSORT checklist should require clinical trial publications to state or reference exceptional informed consent procedures applied for special population groups. A standardised definition of proxy decision-maker types in international clinical trial guidelines would facilitate correct and transparent informed consent for children and children with minor parents. 4.1.5 Study registration CRD42018074220. Manuscript III 76 4.1.6 Keywords Clinical trials; Informed consent; Children; Minor parents; Reporting; Sub-Saharan Africa. 4.2 Background Children under five years in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are disproportionately affected by mal-nutrition and infectious diseases [1, 2], which contributes to a higher percentage of paediatric clinical trials (CTs) performed in SSA compared to Europe or the US [3, 4]. As teenage preg-nancy rates in SSA are among the highest worldwide [5], researchers will likely encounter children with minor parents when conducting CTs in this region [6-8]. Previous evidence from CTs in resource-limited countries indicates that researchers face par-ticular challenges when implementing IC for children with minor parents. The appropriate con-senting person (i.e., proxy decision-maker4) in this case may vary, depend on local legal and cultural conditions, and ad hoc solutions tailored to local customs might be implemented [7, 9]. However, despite the need for careful ethical considerations for this research group [10], evidence on practices is scarce and described typically in secondary studies, which suggests low transparency in primary CT publications [11]. Ethical guidance in research requires not only that consent is provided, but that it is docu-mented and reported transparently [12], which promotes public confidence in research [13]. As insufficient transparency was found to be a significant source of waste in the conduct of research [14], CT registration and publication of CT protocols, results, and participant-level datasets have been widely promoted to increase the usefulness and value of CT documenta-tion [15]. For a more consistent and complete availability of CT information, standardised checklists of critical items to be addressed in CT protocols and publications were implemented [16, 17]. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement guides the CT publications' content. It also includes requirements for details on CT registration and ac-cess to study protocols. The Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional-Trials (SPIRIT) statement guides protocol contents. The endorsement of reporting guidelines contributed to an improved reporting quality of CTs over time [18]. 4 Please refer to Footnotes 4.8.8 Manuscript III 77 Paediatric CTs require special considerations and researchers have argued for a specific checklist with additional reporting items for children. An informal CONSORT adaptation for children was published in 2010 [19]. Different, evidence-based extensions of the CONSORT and the SPIRIT checklists for children are currently being developed [20]. However, in the published development steps, neither of these checklists addresses unique circumstances encountered in resource-limited countries, such as children with minor parents. Based on a systematic literature review, we gained evidence on how IC is provided for children with minor parents in SSA. In a primary analysis, published elsewhere [11], we included any type of publication providing information on the CT recruitment and consent process for such children. Thereby, no CT publication providing such evidence was found. We therefore con-ducted a secondary analysis of the identified CT publications, aiming to determine the level of transparency relating to CT participation of children with minor parents and consent by proxy decision-makers. We discuss the need to expand reporting guidelines for such exceptional cases to increase transparency in CT publications. 4.3 Methods We carried out a systematic literature review registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42018074220) [21] and followed the PRISMA 2009 statement (Appendix 6.12, Table S9) [22]. All the criteria and terms guiding this review were pre-defined, but no protocol was pub-lished. This secondary analysis was based on the same search strategy and screening steps as the primary analysis [11], but we used different eligibility criteria and performed separate full-text assessments. 4.3.1 Search strategy We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar without any time limitation. The search strategy included the elements of IC, decision-making, CTs, minors, and SSA. We performed the first search in July 2017 and updated it in March 2019 based on a revised and improved search strategy [11]. The references of included articles were not sys-tematically searched. However, for publications that explicitly stated that some methodology details were published in other articles, we considered secondary sources for the analysis. We did not list the secondary articles separately in the results, but included them as supple-mentary data accompanying primary CT publications. Manuscript III 78 4.3.2 Eligibility criteria Articles were included if they were publications of CTs involving children in SSA whose parents were potentially minors. Minor parents were broadly defined as adolescents between the age of 12 and the respective age of majority in each country, who are the biological parents of a CT child participant. If information on the parental age was not given, we considered studies in which child participants were < 5 years, because for this age group the probability of minor parents is higher [23]. We referred to CTs as prospective health-related interventions in per-sons [24]. Health-related interventions included drug, vaccine, diagnostic, medical device, sur-gical, emergency research, and dietary supplements trials. CTs had to have taken place in at least one sub-Saharan African country. We only included publications in English or French. 4.3.3 Data extraction and analysis The search results were imported into the reference management software Endnote X7. After removing duplicates, we extracted information (Author, Year, Journal/Publisher, Title, Ab-stract, Keywords, ISBN/ISSN, DOI, and URL) into an MS Excel table for screening. The iden-tified articles were screened in two steps: First, two independent reviewers (ADP and DOB) screened titles and abstracts for potentially eligible articles. Second, if information about an inclusion criterion was missing, one reviewer (ADP) screened additionally full-texts. The re-viewers reached a moderate and substantial agreement for the title and abstract screening of the initial and updated search, respectively [25]. Disagreements were mostly systematic, mainly concerning the distinction of study types, and were all resolved through discussion. One researcher (ADP) then assessed the full-texts of potentially included articles for final eli-gibility and extracted data. The second reviewer (DOB) crosschecked 10% of the full-text ar-ticles for eligibility and the extracted information. Extracted data of resulting full-text articles included CT characteristics and the following ele-ments for analysis: Study location, health condition, medical intervention, population size and type, CT design, ethics committee (EC)/institutional review board (IRB) approval, information sections addressing eligibility criteria, IC approach, and proxy decision-makers. Whenever applicable, we accessed the referenced regulatory and ethical guidance, CT registration de-tails, supplementary files, and referenced protocols. We considered specific sections of the CONSORT statement [17], and its adaptation for children [19] to identify information concern-ing the recruitment and IC approach for children with minor parents. The considered CON-SORT sections included the eligibility criteria, participant flow diagram (exclusions), baseline data, ethical considerations, and access to protocol and registry information. We performed a descriptive analysis using MAXQDA (VERBI GmbH) and MS Excel. Manuscript III 79 In order to assess transparency on reported proxy decision-makers, we defined three levels of transparency according to the level of detail of their description: A basic level of transpar-ency was assigned when neither the type nor the number of proxy decision-makers was spec-ified. A first level of extended transparency was defined when the type or number of proxy decision-makers was specified. A second level of extended transparency was attributed when also the proxy decision-makers' age or competence was taken into account. 4.4 Results The literature search initially identified 3,346 articles (Figure 4). After removing duplicates (n=414), 2,932 articles were screened, of which 2,872 articles were excluded. The full-text was assessed for 60 articles, resulting in 33 included publications. A search update identified 1,450 additional articles, from which 11 were eligible. In total, 44 articles were included in the analysis. Figure 4: Study-selection flow diagram a Total number results from three combined Google Scholar searches. b If the title or abstract lacked information on key ele-ments of the search, the full text of the articles was also screened. c Out of scope: not addressing SSA, not addressing children < 5, clearly addressing adult parents, and not being a clinical trial publication. d List can be found in the additional material (Ap-pendix 6.13, Table S10). Manuscript III 80 The included articles' publication dates ranged from 1990 to 2017. More than half of them (n=25/44, 56.8%) were published from 2011 onward (Table 9). Two of the included articles were conference abstracts [26, 27]. The CTs were conducted in 17 different countries in SSA, with Malawi mentioned most frequently, followed by Ghana and South Africa. Malaria followed by undernutrition, and rotavirus gastroenteritis were the most frequently addressed health conditions, while antimalarials, followed by dietary supplements and vaccines were the most reported interventions. Included study participants were mostly infants, only (n=17/44, birth to <2years), or infants and children combined (n=17/44, birth to <12 years). Five studies also enrolled adolescents (12 to <18 years), four also included adults (18 years and over), and one addressed only children (n=1/44, 2 to <12 years). 31 of the 44 publications provided the pos-sibility of stratification according to the participants' age and included a total of 75,063 children under five years.

While in most CTs, children were directly recruited, in four CTs, recruitment was first based on the eligibility of pregnant women [32, 34, 67, 68]. One of these four publications [32] referred to a CT men-tioning minor mothers in the eligibility criteria. This CT took place in Malawi, recruited mothers and children explicitly as a dyad, and considered minor mothers 15 years and older eligible [71]. Further insight was provided in the study flow diagrams included in the Results section. The Malawian trial excluded \"underage\" mothers (and their children), but without making it clear if the exclusion was due to mothers not meeting the legal age of majority or being under 15 [71]. Additionally, maternal age was listed in the Results among the baseline data, but only the mean age, including standard deviation, was provided without explicitly stating the minimal Manuscript III 84 age of included mothers. Two more CT publications mentioned maternal age in the same way [41, 67] and no other CT report provided details about parental age in the Results section. 4.4.3 Transparency on proxy decision-makers for children's CT participation Proxy decision-makers providing IC for children's CT participation were mentioned 77 times across the CT publications or supplementary materials (i.e., CT registration, protocol, or ref-erenced articles further detailing the methodology) (Table 11). We found the terminology used to describe proxy decision-makers to be variable and identified four were provided in some CT publications or supplementary materials specifying a subtype and number of proxy decision-makers. Subtypes were specified in a third (32.5%), and the number was specified in about half (50.6%) of all cases. In 40.3% of all cases, neither the subtype nor the number was specified. Table 11: Proxy decision-maker types, subtypes, and numbers mentioned across CT publications and supplementary files Proxy decision-maker description n (%) Total 77 (100.0) Parents 30 (39.0) Unspecified parents 23 (29.9) Unspecified number 15 (19.5) Onea 8 (10.3) Mother 4 (5.2) Mother involving fathers/partners/husbands involved in the decision-making 1 (1.3) Mother able to understand study procedures and give consent/of a specific age 2 (2.6) Parents or guardians 28 (36.4) Unspecified parents or guardians 21 (27.3) Unspecified number 13 (16.9) Onea 6 (7.8) At least one 1 (1.3) Each 1 (1.3) Parents or legal guardians/legally acceptable representatives 4 (5.2) Unspecified number 2 (2.6) Onea 1 (1.3) Each 1 (1.3) Parents or guardians of legal age/adult/with the ability to give informed consent 3 (3.9) Unspecified number 2 (2.6) Onea 1 (1.3) 10 (13.0) Manuscript III 85 Caregivers (incl. caretaker, carer) Unspecified caregivers 5 (6.5) Unspecified number 3 (3.9) Onea 1 (1.3) At least one 1 (1.3) Family 3 (3.9) Unspecified number 3 (3.9) Primary caregiver (Mother/Father/Legal guardian) 2 (2.6) Onea 2 (2.6) Guardians 9 (11.7) Unspecified guardians 3 (3.9) Onea 2 (2.6) At least one 1 (1.3) Authorised/identifiable/legal guardian 5 (6.5) Onea 3 (3.9) At least one 2 (2.6) Guardian capable of providing consent 1 (1.3) Onea 1 (1.3) a Single proxy decision-makers were counted whenever the singular was employed to refer to consent by a parent/guardian. When consent was provided by mothers with no other specification, only one decision-maker was counted. Otherwise, terms in their plural form, as well as the designation of \"parental\" were recorded as \"unspecified number\", unless other indications re-garding multiple consenters were provided. The terms used to describe proxy decision-makers were sometimes inconsistent within publi-cations (n=20/44, 45.5%), as well as between publications and registrations (n=16/21, 76.2%) or protocols (n=6/6, 100%). Most inconsistencies within CT publications included a reduction from \"parents or guardians\" to \"parental\" consent, or from \"legal\" or guardians (n=12/20, 60%). However, CT publications (n=8/20, 40%) also applied the terms interchangeably by, e.g., first using \"caretaker\" then \"guardian\", or Inconsist-encies between publications and registrations or protocols mostly included more or less spec-ification of proxy decision-maker types and some included an interchangeable use of terms. Table 12 shows the transparency levels of reported proxy decision-makers in publications and supplementary files. When considering only the CT publications, without supplementary ma-terial, and focusing on the most detailed description of proxy decision-makers within each publication, in half of all CT publications (50.0%) neither the type nor the number of proxy decision-makers was specified. In less than half CT publications (45.5%) transparency on the type of proxy decision-makers was extended, and only one publication provided a second level of extended transparency [32].

Considering previously reported rates of children with minor parents recruited in indi-vidual CTs in resource-limited countries, which ranged from 1.4-4.1% [6-8], 1,051 to 3,078 of the children in our review may have had minor parents unless they were excluded at screening based on parental age. 4.5.1 Transparency on the recruitment of children with minor mothers Publications of CTs recruiting children and their mothers as dyad may list maternal age among the eligibility criteria and the effective reasons for exclusion [32]. In other CT publications, however, maternal eligibility requirements were uncommon, perhaps because research fo-cused on children independently from their mothers. Several CT publications included mater-nal data among the baseline data. These data contained maternal age (mean and standard deviation), years of education, or literacy levels [32, 41, 50, 60, 66-69]. The reporting of these aspects might aim at acknowledging some confounding factors pertinent for the study results. Two of the included CT publications also discussed possible relations between maternal data and study cooperation or the generalisability of study results [41, 68], which emphasises the importance of including information on special population groups in CT publications. Hence, standard reporting of maternal age when including small children as CT participants and the additional provision of the maternal age thresholds (i.e., minimum and maximum age) is a Manuscript III 87 straightforward way for researchers to increase transparency on the inclusion of children with minor mothers who are also the primary caregiver. 4.5.2 Transparency on proxy decision-makers In half of all CT publications, only a blanket statement was provided in the Methods section that IC was granted by four main proxy decision-maker types: \"parents\", \"parents or guardi-ans\", \"guardians\", or \"caregivers\". half of the CT publications additionally specified subtypes of proxy decision-makers (e.g., mother, legal guardian, and primary caregiver) and their number (at least one, each, and one). In 11% of the CT publications 33.3%) providing more trans-parency about the possible involvement of children with underage parents and the require-ments for proxy decision-makers were referenced. Therein, consent was required from par-ents or guardians who were adults (or of legal age) or able (or capable) to understand study procedures and give consent [33, 34, 44, 63, 69]. However, since the corresponding CT pub-lications contained only blanket statements that the consent was given by \"parents or guardi-ans\", the final procedure remained unclear. Overall, the information on proxy decision-makers in CT publications was very brief and over-looked any difficulties or exceptions. This is surprising since previous literature shows that, for example, identifying suitable proxy decision-makers in resource-limited countries can be chal-lenging [72]. Moreover, depending on the policy, context or law applied, the meaning of the main types of proxy decision-makers may vary and leave room for interpretation (Appendix 6.14, Table S11). This requires special attention in developing and reporting on the IC process. In the included CT publications, it remains uncertain whether these aspects were considered. It may well be that researchers are unfamiliar with the ethico-legal terminology on consent and consequentially interpret certain terms as synonymous and employ them as such in practice. Confusion may also arise from the possible variability of the terms across countries. This may explain the high frequency of inconsistencies within and between publications and their regis-trations or protocols, as found in this analysis. We, therefore, believe it is useful to establish standard operational definitions of possible proxy decision-maker types (e.g., guardians, legal guardians, legally acceptable representatives, caregivers) in international CT guidelines to fa-cilitate a correct and coherent use of terminology. Some of the publications referred to national CT guidelines they followed. However, again we could not find any particular statement on the case of children with minor parents. The general absence of information on children with minor parents in CT publications may suggest, first, that this case did not occur in these CTs, and, second, that researchers are not sensitised to Manuscript III 88 the possibility of children having minor parents. In contrast, for example, several CT publica-tions included additional details on other exceptional factors related to IC in resource-limited countries, such as high illiteracy rates and providing oral consent with thumbprints, or the need for prior community consent. One publication also discussed the impact of the social and cul-tural background of the population on consent [57]. Third, authors of CT publications may focus more on reporting that IC was granted, regardless of how this was achieved. Previous research showed that a detailed description of the consent process is uncommon in CT publications [73]. Consequently, the need to provide more details was debated [74]. Some critics question the practicality of adding succinct IC process descriptions, implying that it can be assumed that the adequacy of IC was evaluated and established by a competent ethics committee that has approved the CT [75]. While we agree that extensive IC descriptions in CT publications are not practical, given journals' limited word count, it can also not be ignored that consent processes carry not only ethical but also scientific implications. IC procedures must be appropriate and tailored to the risks involved in each trial and may contribute to selection bias [76]. A description of how the IC procedure is handled for specific groups may, therefore, be useful for the overall picture of the CT. For ethics committees to approve the appropriateness of IC procedures, these must be de-scribed in the CT protocol or reference must be made to applicable guidelines. Only publica-tions can confirm what processes were actually applied. Publishing specific IC processes would not only help ensure the consent's validity, but would also provide guidance for future researchers, prevent protocol deviations, and possibly highlight areas that need new guid-ance. Also, it can incentivise researchers to consider possible practical challenges early on, mitigating recruitment delays and consent withdrawals, and to strengthen reflections on risk-benefit analyses. We, therefore, recommend the general presentation of IC processes in CT publications and argue for the inclusion of evidence on exceptional IC cases. At a minimum, this should be described in an appendix to the publication in case of space limitations. Ethical considerations, including consent, are currently not part of the CONSORT checklist [17]. Although the explanation and elaboration of CONSORT refers to IC and mentions that obtaining consent should be reported, it defers to journal instructions for specific ethical re-quirements [77]. The CONSORT adaptations for children, however, deem IC in paediatrics more complicated than for adults and propose consent related considerations to the checklist, such as reporting if assent was provided [19, 20]. This view reinforces our recommendations, as similar to paediatric CTs, consent procedures in CTs conducted in resource-limited coun-tries may require specific considerations meriting additional clarification in publications. In case a new CONSORT extension for paediatric CTs is developed, it should address ethical Manuscript III 89 requirements and ask for an explicit description of exceptional IC situations for special popu-lation groups and of the solutions implemented. The SPIRIT protocol development checklist already contains a requirement to specify how the IC should be obtained from participants [16]. Our review found that CT protocols that were likely developed after the implementation of SPIRIT provided increased transparency about the proxy decision-maker, emphasising the possible benefit of including consent requirements also in checklists for CT publications. Furthermore, our study found that only a small number of publications provided information on the CT phase. However, a clear indication of the phase is useful to ascertain IC validity, as it is an indicator of research borne risks. It potentially has an impact on the operationalisation of the IC, including the selection and number of proxy decision-makers. The CONSORT ex-planation and elaboration paper also recognises that specifying the phase may be relevant in drug trials [77]. 4.5.3 Strengths and limitations To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review specifically analysing the recruitment and consent of children with minor parents in CT publications. The search strategy was designed to identify articles that relate to consent and proxy decision-makers in the abstract. If articles did not include such information in the abstract and were not otherwise linked to our topics of interest, they were not detected in some of the databases. Moreover, we included only CT publications that provide information on consent. Previous studies have shown that a small percentage of CT publications do not report the provision of consent [78, 79]. Additionally, by focusing on children with minor parents in SSA, our review addressed a vulnerable research population in resource-limited countries. Researchers on these trials may manifest an in-creased cautiousness to individual challenges, which can lead to significant reporting of IC information [78]. Hence, the extent of IC information provided in our selection of CT publica-tions may not be generalizable. However, these limitations also suggest that we identified CT publications that provide above-average information on consent. Therefore, it is likely that, overall, the management of children with minor parents in research might be even less trans-parent than shown in our analysis, which underlines the importance of increasing standards in reporting. Also, due to the nature of our search that excluded individual protocol publications, articles including IC information only in the corresponding CT protocol may have been missed. Fur-ther, CT publications that referred to other literature for more details on the research method-ology, but did not specifically refer to \"consent\" or \"permission\" within their text, may have Manuscript III 90 been missed. Our search strategy may have also overlooked some specific terms. For exam-ple, we searched for \"adolescent pregnancy\" but did not explicitly include the term \"pregnant women\", which may inadvertently excluded studies in which children of underage parents could be the focus of CTs with pregnant women. Further strengths and limitations were previ-ously published [11]. 4.6 Conclusions Despite the increased probability to encounter minor parents when recruiting children under five years of age in CTs in SSA countries, no CT publication in our analysis allowed us to ascertain whether such children were indeed included and who provided consent on their be-half. Transparency on the recruitment of children with minor parents could be increased when reporting additionally the minimum maternal age alongside maternal data provided in baseline data. Furthermore, CT publications should include or reference exceptional IC procedures applied for special population groups and these ethical considerations should be required by the CONSORT checklist. A standardised terminology on proxy decision-maker types in inter-national CT guidelines would also facilitate correct and transparent consent processes for children in general and, more importantly, for children with minor parents. 4.7 List of abbreviations SSA: Sub-Saharan Africa; CT: Clinical trial; Recommendations for EDCTP: European and de-veloping countries clinical trial partnership. 4.8 Declarations 4.8.1 Ethics approval and consent to participate Not applicable. 4.8.2 Consent for publication Not applicable.

Discussion 99 5 Discussion 5.1 Clinical trial quality definition Despite continuous debate about CT quality in recent years, no evidence-based definition of CT quality was yet available, which still represented a potential source of wasteful as well as undervalued CT activities. In response to the REWARD campaign, an academic quality frame-work called INcreasing QUality In patient-oriented academic clinical REsearch (INQUIRE) was developed to provide an understanding of different aspects influencing CT quality [1, 2]. How-ever, when developing the framework, the authors did not particularly consider the perspective of RLS. A recent report on the ongoing complete revision of the ICH-GCP guideline has in-creased focus on the need to redefine the meaning of \"high-quality\" trials and opened a dis-cussion on how best to incorporate RLS-specific factors in CT guidelines [3]. This thesis aimed to contribute to the definition of CT quality by including the perspective of researchers with experience conducting CTs in such settings. 5.1.1 How was clinical trial quality defined? We approached the definition of CT quality by performing semi-structured qualitative inter-views and analysing them using the framework method. We involved three CT stakeholder types (investigators, sponsors, monitors) experienced in conducting CTs of various models (i.e., IIT, industry, and mixed partnerships) across multiple countries in SSA. To get a holistic picture of what interviewees perceive as CT quality, we asked them first to define it in their own words in an unlimited way and second to try to phrase it in one sentence. We first ana-lysed the one-sentence definition to define an initial framework of elements that build up CT quality. Then, we used the unlimited definition to confirm and elaborate on the CT quality elements. CT quality definitions resulted in 11 elements. These elements formed a quality concept, which we organised into two components: (i) CT quality-building factors and (ii) CT quality-promoting factors. CT quality-building factors consisted of a) Scientific factors (Relevance and patient-centeredness; Scientific soundness; Adherence to study-specific requirements; Documenta-tion; Data integrity) and b) Moral factors (Participant safety and rights; Adherence to general requirements). CT quality-promoting factors included Context adaptation; Infrastructure; Part-nership; Quality system; and Operational excellence (Figure 2, p.32). Discussion 100 5.1.2 How did the resource-limited settings perspective contribute to the clinical trial quality concept? Searching the interviews for RLS-specific aspects resulted in 12 themes: Health conditions; Accessibility; Education Culture; Facility level; Collaboration; Communication; and Sustainability. The RLS-specific themes the CT quality-promoting factors \"Context adaptation\", \"Infrastructure\", and \"Partnership\". Many of these RLS-specific themes have been previously reported in the literature; however, they are not from a perspective strictly oriented towards associations with CT quality. For ex-ample, existing literature addressed RLS-settings-specific aspects mainly from the perspec-tive of ethics [4, 5], ICH-GCP applicability [6-8], or challenges and lessons learned when im-plementing specific studies in specific regions in SSA [9-11]. One other study focused explicitly on quality indicators for CTs in RLS [12]; however, it was restricted to CT implementation rather than the entire CT scope. Hence, this study offers the first comprehensive CT quality concept, which includes the perspective from RLS. 5.1.3 How does our clinical trial quality concept relate to the INQUIRE framework? Our approach to defining CT quality contributed to the understanding of CT quality in multiple ways: First, we used the opportunity to complement the existing INQUIRE framework through methodological triangulation. By applying qualitative interviews, we could collect independent perspectives, while the INQUIRE framework was principally based on a review of existing concepts [2]. Second, the building elements of our CT quality concept were comparable to the INQUIRE framework. Given the complexity of quality, it was remarkable that the results, which emerged inductively from our interview analysis, had many parallels to the INQUIRE framework. Our approach to methodological triangulation supports thus how quality in clinical research was conceptualised in the INQUIRE framework [1]. Thereby, an essential similarity was the idea of a multidimensional CT quality concept. In particular, considering \"CT quality-promoting fac-tors\" as a separate CT quality dimension resulted in being a shared conceptual complement to the conventional two-dimensional quality standard of the ICH-GCP guideline, which primar-ily focuses on scientific and ethical requirements [13]. Also, the fact that all RLS-specific themes were categorised as CT quality-promoting factors underlines the need to consider such factors when managing CTs in RLS. Discussion 101 Third, our concept also confirmed variability between the main interests of stakeholder groups, as reported by the authors of the INQUIRE framework. For example, the authors of the IN-QUIRE framework found that Academic research and Clinical Trial Units focused mainly on the following themes: Absence of bias, and Relevance and transparency, whereas the Phar-maceutical industry and Contract Research Organisations focused mainly on high-quality data [2]. In our concept, investigators mainly associated CT quality with scientific soundness, while sponsors emphasised participant safety and rights and data integrity, and monitors focused primarily on adherence (i.e., to guidelines, regulations, protocol, and SOPs). This variability, especially between sponsors and investigators, may be explained by the fact that sponsors are less involved in implementing the CT. Therefore, they may relate quality more to CT goals, such as safe participants and data integrity, which are also defined as critical CT aspects by current guidance on CT quality management (i.e., ICH-GCP, CTTI perceptions) [13, 14]. In contrast, investigators may have a more ongoing focus on scientific work during the CT imple-mentation process. Fourth, our findings also brought some additions to the INQUIRE framework: In our CT quality concept, the \"CT quality-promoting factors resulted in being more diverse including Context adaptation, Infrastructure, Partnership, Quality system, and Operational excellence. In com-parison, the INQUIRE framework includes only two promoters: Infrastructure and Sustainabil-ity and Education. While most of the promoters listed in our concept were categorised differ-ently in the INQUIRE framework, some topics were entirely absent. For example, we could not identify the themes under Context adaptation in the INQUIRE framework; however, the authors addressed this gap partially in their limitations (i.e., not considering societal aspects and beliefs). Hence, the following points that emerged from our interviews could complement the INQUIRE framework: 1) Clear communication of infrastructural disadvantages and their potentially significant impact on timelines and, ultimately, the quality of CTs to funders, spon-sors, and auditors, 2) Prevention of exploitation of research populations and workforce in re-source-limited countries by following specific available ethical frameworks, and 3) Context ad-aptation, including the consideration of the participants' health conditions, participant accessi-bility, education levels, cultural, as well as regional aspects. 5.1.4 Can developed settings benefit from a resource-limited settings perspective on clinical trial quality? Our findings from the RLS perspective emphasised the need for a multidimensional CT quality concept to contribute to comprehensive quality management (CQM). Such a comprehensive perception offers the opportunity to use resources in a more targeted and economical manner. Discussion 102 From the RLS perspective, context adaptation, infrastructure, partnership, operational excel-lence, and quality system emerged as supplementary quality-promoting factors that influence CT quality in addition to the traditional focus on scientific and ethical aspects. A quality concept that encompasses these factors offers the possibility to systematically consider them in the CT process. The RLS-specific aspects were broadly categorised as context adaptation, infrastructure, and partnership, and therefore these categories can be considered as key variables when working in different CT environments. The three CT quality-promoting factors (i.e., context adaptation, communication of infrastruc-tural disadvantages to CT stakeholders, and prevention of exploitation of workforce and study populations) we suggested to complement the INQUIRE framework may also be useful for developed settings, as these are also present in settings in the Global North, although to a lower degree or more difficult to detect. Further, some themes emerged from the interviews based on RLS that need further research to understand their potential impact on CTs conducted in developed settings. One such theme was the different funding mechanisms in RLS and their role in CT quality. For example, de-pending on the funding mechanisms, CT quality expectations of the funders could be very variable. In this context, some of our interviewees stated that external governmental funders often just cared for the CTs to deliver results, while international funding mechanisms provided clear CT expectations (e.g., to follow GCP, implement capacity building, electronic data cap-turing tools, community engagement, etc.) based on the respective study context. Another concept mentioned repetitively in the context of CT planning in RLS was community engagement, which supports adapting a CT to local circumstances. However, it is not clear how far it overlaps with the concept of the engagement of patient representatives, which is also common in developed research settings. A recent study has shown that these concepts overlap and need further clarification [15]. Also, our interviews did not reveal the extent to which the interviewees distinguished between these concepts. Moreover, one interviewee suggested that the term \"patient representative\" could be stigmatising or exclusive towards research with healthy populations (e.g., vaccines, preventive treatments). Hence, clear defini-tions of these concepts may help determine their role in CT quality and their potential impact in diverse settings. Discussion 103 5.2 Informed consent by minor parents In SSA, there is a higher probability of children involved in CTs to have minor parents. How-ever, clear international guidance on the appropriate person to consent on behalf of such chil-dren is missing. In some countries, the legal age of majority and conditions for emancipation or \"mature minor\" status may not be defined by law [16]. Even if such legislation exists, it may not correspond to local customs [17]. Due to these uncertainties, we performed two analyses based on a systematic literature review. The first one addressed reported IC approaches for the CT recruitment of children with minor parents in various studies, and the second one fo-cused on the level of transparency about the CT recruitment of children with minor parents, specifically in CT publications. Our first study showed that informed consent in this situation is implemented in various ways: While in Kenya, a minor mother would be directly allowed to consent [18], in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, she would not, despite becoming legally emancipated when being married [19]. When no guidance existed, the decision of whether minor mothers were able to consent for their child could be drawn from concepts of medical care [20] or depended on the local decision-making culture [21]. In the latter case, the process had to be established in collaboration with the local stake-holders (e.g., community and ethics committees). In order to facilitate the development of an appropriate IC approach that considers these various realities, we provided seven recommen-dations (3.6 Conclusions, p.68). We also recommended including specific reporting require-ments in international guidelines to promote transparency about such exceptional cases (3.6 Conclusions, p.68). We further analysed the level of transparency in CT publications about recruiting children with minor parents. This analysis revealed that none of the included articles provided robust evi-dence on whether any recruited children had minor parents and how consent was obtained for them. Specific descriptions of decision-maker types were provided rarely and mainly in referenced CT registrations or protocols. Also, terminology describing proxy decision-makers was often used inconsistently. We provided several recommendations on how to improve re-porting quality (4.6 Conclusions, p.90). The informed consent for children with minor parents represents a showcase of how contex-tual aspects can impact CT quality if not addressed appropriately. Considering the challenges are on a very specific level, involving children of minor parents, which represent an \"exception of an exception\", researchers may be placing less emphasis on the detail of information needed to truly assure transparency. Hence, the essence of IC is often not sufficiently repre-sented in as many details in study publications as \"scientific\" aspects [22]. Despite being only a small aspect in the process compared to the overall context of a CT, IC carries both ethical Discussion 104 but also scientific implications [23]. On the one hand, IC ensures the rights of patients. On the other hand, IC also influences the recruitment of study participants, which ultimately affects the study outcomes. Moreover, IC is a sensitive issue that determines the relationship between participants and researchers, which, in a more distant sense, can also affect the participants' safety or future study recruitment successes. In the existing CT guidelines, patient rights and safety already play a central role [13, 14]. However, this example shows that the management of exceptional cases lacks transparency and thus fails to correlate with its importance. A CT quality framework could integrate tools for handling such cases and promote appropriate consideration at each stage of a CT (i.e., plan-ning, execution, and documentation). 5.3 Methodological challenges and limitations This thesis was primarily based on qualitative research methodology, considered suitable for answering each research question. 5.3.1 Clinical trial quality concept We considered conducting qualitative interviews since the research focused on an interpreta-tion of quality based on CT stakeholders' personal experiences. Thereby, we chose a semi-structured design of the interview guide with open-ended questions, as it offered the possibility to define the core components of the interview but still allowed the interview participants to address further topics intuitively. The framework method is commonly used for the analysis of semi-structured interviews and benefited our research through the possibility of combining inductive and deductive data analysis approaches [24]. To minimise bias, we attempted to systematically select participants by filtering CT registries for CTs performed in SSA in the past five years. However, this method required extensive data cleaning before we could contact individuals because the indexing of CTs in the database did not accurately distinguish between CTs and observational studies. After contacting and re-contacting the first group of stakeholders, the response rate was low compared to the effort invested in collecting their contact details. The idea of contacting additionally observational researchers in the hope that they would also have CT experience risked an even lower re-sponse rate and was abandoned. However, we still consider CT registries valuable sources for such contacts, but rather when aiming for short surveys instead of one-hour interviews. Hence, we obtained more than half of the sample size through snowball sampling. In addition, Discussion 105 we considered the attendance at conferences combined with the screening of conference par-ticipants a helpful method of collecting contacts, which was more systematic than relying solely on known personal contacts. During the interviews, the answers and follow-up questions could have been influenced by the personal interests of the interviewees as well as by a possible leading by the interviewers. However, a semi-structured interview guide allowed for a common basic interview structure [25]. We conducted the interviews primarily using Skype or a phone, which may have influenced the interview atmosphere or prevented trustworthiness. However, the topics addressed were not personal. Also, as the interviewees often previously participated in international research, they were used to the idea of communicating about quality remotely. Still, in a few cases, there was some reluctance on the part of the interviewees to answer questions due to disruptions of the internet connection. Also, in some cases, interviewees may have felt tested based on the nature of the topic \"quality\". We tried to prevent this perception by addressing this possi-bility upfront in the information sheet. Overall, we considered remote interviews appropriate, given the nature of the research topic. When considering the external validity of this research approach, the main limitation was the small sample size. However, many interviewees had extensive experience from various coun-tries and studies conducted in SSA. Also, we reflected on the potential variability of the coun-tries' infrastructures and tried to generalise only subject levels applicable to most participants. Another limitation was that we included only three stakeholder groups. We chose these groups as they are closely involved in the conduct of CTs and likely oversee the entire process, and this kind of oversight was considered key to the development of the CT quality concept. Nev-ertheless, the concept only represents an initial attempt to set a basic framework for CT qual-ity. Hence, the CT concept could benefit from future input, including different stakeholder groups (e.g., ethics committees, study participants, regulatory authorities, etc.). However, add-ing these perspectives would have exceeded the scope of this project. Also, it seems more suitable to address these stakeholder groups at the local level through the involvement of local researchers. 5.3.2 Systematic literature review The main challenge of the systematic review was that we searched for a scarce situation (i.e., informed consent by minor parents) among a vast topic (i.e., consent issues in paediatric re-search in sub-Saharan Africa). Keywords to detect relevant information were very insensitive, Discussion 106 as they were based on qualitative content and blended in with the rest of the literature. Rele-vant information was rarely addressed as a primary topic and could sometimes be found only in tangential thoughts. The risk of missing this information was high and required a rigorous screening process. Also, distinguishing CTs from other research posed challenges since study characteristics were not always clearly reported in titles and abstracts. Therefore, we had to implement an additional full-text screening strategy to increase screening efficiency. Some challenges could also be attributed to the reviewers' minimal experience conducting systematic literature reviews. The search strategy and data extraction of such literature re-views are often developed by experienced medical librarians. However, for our studies, we first involved a librarian only at the beginning of the review to comment on the search strategy. We then involved another librarian at a later stage to update the search. However, the lead author performed the main steps in developing the search and screening strategy. Some ad-ditional technical challenges can be found in the respective publications (3 Manuscript II, p.46 and 4 Manuscript III, p.74). 5.4 Future implications Over the past decades, an increasing amount of literature has been published reporting spe-cific challenges in the conduct of CTs in RLS [9-11]. However, little empiric research has been done to translate such learning into helpful guidance [26]. This work attempted to contribute to filling this gap by integrating a RLS perspective in the definition of CT quality. However, the findings are conceptual and need to be translated into practice. Additionally, further research, including different stakeholder groups, would be beneficial to challenge the concept. A possible approach could involve a presentation of the concept to researchers in RLS involving an international panel. Moreover, researchers involved in developing the IN-QUIRE framework could be approached to discuss the value of the findings and a potential amendment, integrating the RLS-specific aspects. The findings could also be considered a validation of the INQUIRE framework since they con-firmed the conceptual building blocks and showed its transferability to RLS. Furthermore, this conceptual validation could also inform the current discussion with respect to the renovation of the ICH-GCP guideline about redefining \"high quality\" in CTs [3]. In doing so, the CT quality concept could help in discussing whether and how to integrate the concept of Comprehensive Quality Management, CT quality-promoting factors and RLS-specific guidance into general guidance. Discussion 107 The second part of this PhD resulted in specific recommendations on how to approach and raise transparency about the informed consent for children with minor parents. These recom-mendations could have a potential influence on international CT guidance [27] as well as re-porting practice [28]. Moreover, it could encourage national and local ethics committees and researchers to take leadership in increasing community engagement to provide local guidance for sensitive subjects. 5.5 Conclusions Through the involvement of stakeholders with experience in conducting CTs in RLS, we were able to define a CT quality concept combining scientific and ethical aspects, as well as CT quality-promoting factors. This finding is in line with the existing INQUIRE framework, which also represents a multidimensional quality concept and includes the component of quality pro-moters. Compared to the conventional two-dimensional quality standard of the ICH-GCP (R1 & R2), which focuses primarily on scientific and ethical requirements, a multidimensional CT quality provides oversight and puts critical CT dimensions into context with each other. Such a perception offers the opportunity to use resources in a more targeted and economic manner independently of whether CTs are conducted in the Global North or South. Hence, we propose considering such a multidimensional quality concept as a basis for \"Comprehensive Quality Management\" (CQM), which may be considered in future global CT quality management guid-ance. In our work, RLS-specific CT aspects were mostly related to CT quality-promoting factors. Therefore, considering CT quality-promoting factors in future CT quality models will help man-age CT quality more effectively. Also, RLS-specific CT aspects resulted in potential additions to the promoters defined in the INQUIRE framework (i.e., context adaptation, communication of infrastructural disadvantages to CT stakeholders, and prevention of exploitation of work-force and study populations). These additional CT quality-promoting factors are also essential to CT management in the Global North, where they are less visible and, therefore, at risk of being neglected. A specific topic we addressed in our work was the quality of the IC method for children with minor parents in SSA. This issue emerged during the execution of CTs in RLS. While IC con-cerns the participants' rights, which is a critical objective in existing quality standards, trans-parency about the actual methodology used was low. We developed guidance on establishing and reporting the IC methodology in such exceptional cases. Such guidance should find en-trance into CT quality concepts, e.g., the INQUIRE framework.

Appendix One-sentence clinical trial quality definitions Table S4: One-sentence clinical trial quality definitions Interview participant Definition 01A Well, for me I would call it the clinical trial is the trial that is directly related to the improvement of the life of the vulnerable population. 02A Let's say, it's a full quality assurance management system that looks at all the aspects and try to set up systems for all these aspects, not too heavy, but that can cover many aspects and not only one. But that does not become too heavy to paralyse the whole trial, because this can be too much and then it can paralyse the whole thing. So it has to be clever, light, but very targeted to the main risks, as you said when we talked about risks, but covering several aspects and not just one, something like that. I mean not just SOP's, it goes beyond SOP's, it goes...it's also just [...] Yes, how to cleverly recruit people, how to cleverly follow the data, so it has several aspects. 03A A good quality trial is a trial that is desired by the local investigators. ...No, I mean, the different thing is, the quality of a trial is, can be assessed by a lot of different things, and maybe not always all together, or, you know, kind of, for me a good quality trial can be a trial where everybody is happy, meaning the sponsor, because he got what he wanted, the CRO because...the investigators they got...the local investigators they got what they wanted...And finally the target population benefits, you know kind of, I think and benefits rather early than rather late, than if it's rather late. 04A [Laughs] I don't know, one sentence is really difficult because it's so much, it's so many aspects I would say you cannot really define it in one sentence, it's so many interplaying aspects that come together which need to be fulfilled [...] I think, I've mentioned several times before it's really these partnerships. It's the presence, the motivation, it's a good team, it's yeah all this. 05A I cannot, define or...? Yes I think it's difficult to define but...The quality is safeguarding the integrity of clinical trial data and protecting the safety of participants in a clinical trial. 06A Ahm...In one sentence I would say, you have not done harm and you have documented what you have formulated in your case report forms and you have met your primary objectives. 07A Based on the quality of the clinical trial, your clinical trials data reflects this quality...and if you want to have good results, valuable results you have to have good quality. 08A It's a huge challenge [assumption: to conduct a good quality trial]...but I think that...it's getting better now, also with the trial master file. Like, my first clinical trial didn't have a master file. So it's getting...now we are getting to more and more rules and stricter which might seem a bit boring and a bit too much when you are stressed in... [...] Yeah, when you are on the field you are really stressed and you don't want to pay attention on signature. But I think in the end it is really important, to have something that discipline your work step by step, so only have to do this, this, this. 09A It's a difficult task. Ok, let's try. I would say, check everything on a daily basis to make sure that...Yeah, check everything on a daily basis. Everything is what you have done as a work, your files, your patient forms, your informed consent form - check your daily work. Take time in the evening to check your daily work, so you ensure the quality. 10A In one sentence...Clinical trial quality means ensuring that we strictly obey by the step out and that what is outlined in the methodology. Okay, I would say that the clinical trial quality is ensuring that we strictly obey by the, by the standards that we set out in the methodology. 11A That's the most difficult question, you are asking me today [laughs]. So, clinical trial quality...Clinical trial quality is a set...I would say it's all factors that help you collect data that will help you arrive at the right conclusions, all the factors that contribute to what...the successful achievement of a correct conclusion from a study. 12A Clinical trial quality...Yes it is [challenging]. Clinical trial quality... Appendix 123 [...] Ok. Clinical trial quality...ok I can say clinical trial quality is dependent on the quality of data generated, yeah...and ensuring the safety of the participant is upheld at all times. 13A How I would define it? Well, you can't [define quality in one sentence]. No, in one sentence no. We just talked about it [referring to the whole interview. Considering also the initial question about the meaning of clinical trial quality, where the participant replied \"everything\", we went for \"many aspects\" in the analysis]. 14A Yes, I think good clinical trial quality is a clinical trial which follows all ICH-GCP & GCLP requirements and is having a good and well trained team to perform it. 15A I guess, I would, maybe the...in one sentence... Let's see: The rigorous execution of an important scientific question downed upon a cohort...or a clinical trial, which stresses an important hypothesis just founded upon a sound scientific premise. They are the phrases brought to-gether in one sentence. 16A Oh in one sentence [laughs]...Oh gosh, ok, so...I would say in one sentence...Clinical trial quality is about providing or ensuring...providing assurance that the data you collect is credible and accurate and at the same time making sure that, you know, all the safety, the wellbeing, the rights, integrity of the volunteers are taken into account or are protected. 17A I think clinical trial quality...refers to steps taken, to ensure the smooth running, and minimisation of bias and con-founding in a trial. 18A I think I'm going to say: If...clinical trial quality depends on the design and the methodology applied to the study [...] But a good quality study is a well-thought, well-planned, well-conducted study even in resource-limited settings. That's what I would say. 19A In one sentence, the quality means that the compliance with the requirements and the credibility, so that the data which will come out of the clinical trial will be reliable. 20A The quality after involvement is the safety...wherever the safety is and getting high quality that means that the clinical trial quality, I think, is where you applied very well all...that it takes to the safety of your participants then the quality is there. I would sum up that it's safety, quality equals safety. Quality, quality is if you have to carry out a good clinical trial, quality wise you should have a good safety awareness. 21A Yeah, Clinical trial quality in one sentence is that...the quality is specifically, how good or close to reality, close to the truth you are with your data, in form of a clinical trials, so this would be ability to get accurate and valid information for that kind of study, and that reaches the study objectives. 01B Quality is equal to...data integrity plus ethics. 02B I think clinical trial quality is really critical, it's crucial, it's one of the most important aspects and it's really what ensures your data quality and ensures that you think about the patient safety first. All this quality that has to be put in place...it's difficult in one sentence, sorry [laughs]...I think, yeah...quality is a lot about patient safety and wellbeing. 03B Ok, the quality...the quality of a clinical trial starts from the protocol. The protocol determines the end. If the protocol is complicated, then the study tools may not be clear enough to collect the kind of data that you need to answer the research question, so if the protocol is also ambiguous, then, you know, your analysis of the statistics may not be clear enough, you know, to define the end points. I think, for me it's really the protocol. The simpler the protocol, the lower the risk of having problems with quality and implementation. So more complex protocols, more ambiguous protocols, you know, risk of you having problems with quality down the stream. 04B Integrity of data...So no matter what kind of results we get, we have to be able to reproduce by doing different analyses at the end of the day. The quality...most of the people...That's all, that's with the integrity of the data at the end. 05B Wow...hm. Ok, I would say a trial that has been conducted adhering to the protocol, while ensuring the safety of the trial participants. Appendix 124 06B Mmh, that's a good question...well, I suppose, the bottom line is. I would...You can say that the quality of the clinical trials was good, if the data are good. I mean that's...it's all about the data, unfortunately, at the end of the day it is the data. 07B Oh my...in one sentence...clinical trial quality really comes down to good participant experience and trustworthy data. 08B You are aspiring to demonstrate operational excellence as well as excellent quality of data but you have to be flexible to understand that they will not necessarily be perfect, and you will need to adapt and be accepting of what you find with a reason. 09B Quality data is data that we can depend on to answer our question. To me that's what it means. Clinical trial quality, yes, it is thrilled down to data eventually, because this is what we are trying to generate. 10B I would say...I would define clinical trial quality and that it's not well defined. I think particularly in African setting that whole quality management of clinical trials...that is something that needs to be developed as an independent unit so that it supports the trials better...and I don't see enough networking of quality people in Africa to see that they help each other very well. 11B Clinical trial quality are all the measures that are put in place in order to protect subjects who take part in clinical trials while ensuring meaningful data generation. 12B Clinical trial quality in once sentence...well...You need a sound protocol and an adequately trained team and taking into account the community and patients' wellbeing into consideration. 13B Wow. I think for a good clinical trial it is important that the data that will come out of it is clear and the patient is not put at risk. 01C I would not be able to define it in one sentence, and I will tell you why [laughs]. So I am currently dealing, or partici-pating in a study where...which I believe was messed up by a monitor and the quality was really bad, so then our CRO was contracted to come in and try to mitigate and the quality extremely low to an extent that even enrolment logs were missing. So quality of clinical trials is that monitors' objectives still vary in sub-Saharan Africa, I would say. Largely, the quality is good, but there is still, you know, projects of very poor quality of the research than under the watch of monitors actually. So there's still quite a bit work that needs to be done. 02C In one sentence, oh...The quality of the study is the totality of data, material, and staff that collaborates to reach this quality. 03C In one sentence! I can't say in one sentence; I always touch a lot of whatever I have been mentioning. Maybe I would say in one word, compliance to protocols, procedures, GCP/GCLP and ethical requirements. 04C Clinical trial quality is mandatory, it's everything... I would say clinical trial quality is not...is not...something that people could say I want to do it, I don't want, it's mandatory. If we are not adhering to the guidelines, then nobody is going to trust what we are producing. So the quality is mandatory, no discussion on quality, I say no discussion on quality, no discussion! 05C Yes I'm saying that the quality of a clinical trial must be a trial that is conducted according to the laid out principles, as ensured in the ICH-GCP standards and according to SOPs and according to the protocol. 06C How will I define quality? Quality is...quality is doing what you do best, sticking with the international standards. 07C Ah...mmm! I think that's the most difficult one! [...] Ok. So I will say...yeah...quality is a continuous process [laughing]. 08C Clinical trials practice is a [...] set of the GCP-ICH guideline, country regulation guideline and sponsor, and site SOP. 09C Yeah...in one sentence [laughing]...You know, the thing is that at the end of the day, the clinical trial should be able to give you the right figure, you know, the right figure of the question you are asking yourself. You need to ensure that when you are doing a clinical trial, the information you will have is the right information. I mean you need to get the right information when you are doing a trial. You do not need to have a bias, you do not need to have a, you know...a good clinical trial is a clinical trial that gives you the right information. 10C For my expertise, doing the right thing at the right time [mentioning earlier in the interview: doing the right things right]. 11C I think there are a lot of challenges, but every person involved with this standardisation, with ICH-GCP, every person is fighting to fulfill all the requirements of ICH-GCP. I think this is a good thing. Appendix 125 12C Oh my! [laughs]. Ah...Clinical trial quality...I would say that clinical trial... I mean for me just clinical trial quality means to stick to the protocol and guidelines that are required. I mean I can't think of anything else of like a summary for that. They have to follow.

In the UK context, for example, this will include legally appointed guardians and also many others, such as grandparents, who have ac-quired parental responsibility through a parental responsibility order or residence order.\" (Nuffield 2015 [2]) Guardian Decision-making au-thority exercised by proxy, typically with legal power when permission is dele-gated to a guardian who is legally ap-pointed (recognised as legal representa-tive, e.g., court-ap-pointed). - May be a short form for \"legal guardian\": - \"Permission of a parent or legally authorized representative: The researcher must ob-tain the permission of at least one parent or guardian.\" (CIOMS 2016 [3]) - \"[...] permission of a parent, legal guardian or other duly authorized representative.\" (CIOMS 2016 [3]) - \"Parental (legal guardian) consent/permission: Expression of understanding and agree-ment by fully informed parent(s) or legal guardian to permit the investigator/sponsor of a clinical study to enrol a child in a clinical investigation.\" (ICH-E11 2017 [4]) - If \"guardian\" also equals interpreted in the sense of \"legally acceptable representative\" as defined by the ICH-E6 2016 guideline, it relates to any individual au-thorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of the child, which also covers \"par-ents\". - May be defined by national law: \"Guardian\" (if there is no parent): either court-appointed OR as indicated by the parent in a will (South African Children's Act 38 of 2005 [1]). - May be used in a broader context: \"In accordance with relevant national regulations, the permission of an immediate family member or other person with a close personal relation-ship with the individual must be sought [...] in situations where a legally authorized repre-sentative is not available to allow for timely enrolment, researchers may obtain the permis-sion of a representative who is socially accepted but not formally recognised before the law.\" (CIOMS 2016 [3]) Caregiver Informal or formal (when recognised as legal representative, e.g., court-ap-pointed) decision-making authority ex-ercised by proxy - May be short for primary caregiver: \"[...] a qualitative study was conducted to explore caregiver and community perceptions [...] primary caregivers (i.e., mothers and fathers) of eligible infants [...]\" (Achieng et al. 2020 [5]). - May be defined by national law: \"Caregiver\" (if there is no parent, guardian, or foster par-ent) \"[...] any person other than a parent or guardian, who factually cares for a child and includes - a) a foster parent; b) a person who cares for the child with the implied or ex-press consent of a parent or guardian of the child; c) a person who cares for the child whilst the child is in temporary safe care; d) the person at the head of a child and youth care centre where a child has been placed; e) the person at the head of a shelter; f) a child and youth care worker who cares for a child who is without appropriate family care in the community; and g) the child at the head of a child headed household' (South African Chil-dren's Act 38 of 2005 [1]) References 1.
