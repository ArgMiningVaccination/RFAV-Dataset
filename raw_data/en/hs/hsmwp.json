You've come to the right place. I enjoy a reputation in Durango for having a very gentle, yet surprisingly effective approach to Acupuncture. We'll begin your appointment with a thorough consultation involving tongue and pulse diagnosis, then you'll slip between the flannel sheets on the heated massage table and allow your senses to unwind. Depending on what you need, your session may involve massage with myofascial techniques, essential oils, guided meditation, cupping, moxa and cranial sacral therapy in addition to thoughtfully placed needles. You may be shown a few therapeutic yoga poses, given some recipes, or herbal supplement suggestions and will hopefully leave feeling nurtured, empowered and pain free. Initial 50 Appointment $130 50 minute Follow up $100 80 Minute (for those wanting a longer session) $145 for follow ups or additional $35 for initial appointments 5 pack: $445 (save $55) 10 pack: $880 (save $120) Cosmetic Acupuncture Looking for a non-toxic alternative to botox? As Durango's only certified Mei Zen Cosmetic Acupuncture practitioner, I use the combination of face and body to points to correct constitutional imbalances while directing collagen and elastin to the face. Reduce fine lines and wrinkles, improve acne, even out skin tone, firm jawline, and tighten pores while releasing the tension held in the face. As each session involves constitutional points, you may notice a reduction of pain, enhanced energy, improved digestion and sleep, less sinus congestion or headaches and reduction of stress. All treatments involve cleansing, toning and mask with natural Astara products as well as microcurrent, facial steaming, and hand and foot massage. Acupuncture facelifts involve twice weekly appointments for 5 weeks and last for 6 to 12 months. 65 minute individual $140 per treatment Acupuncture face-lift ten pack $1250 (save $150) Shonishin Pediatric Acupuncture Shonishin is a gentle and needle free approach to Acupuncture specifically designed for children. This system was developed by the Japanese and involves the use of specially hand welded tiny metal tools that are used to gently sweep and scrape along meridian pathways. Additionally one or two points may be needled with no retention if necessary. Children respond beautifully to shonishin treatments which can be effective for the following issues: bed wetting, indigestion and colic, teething, sleeping problems, emotional upset, ear infections, ADHD and more...I also carry a line of pediatric Chinese tinctures from a company in Boulder. These formulas are incredibly effective for the treatment of ear infections, teething and attention issues. $50 per half hour appointment Herbal Consultation Herbs are a very big part of Chinese Medicine, with hundreds and single herbs and complex formula recipes that have been handed down through generations for thousands of years. Chinese herbs are an excellent way to accelerate and compliment your Acupuncture treatments and recommendations are included with all treatments. At Durango Acupuncture Clinic, I carry an in-depth inventory of Chinese and western herbs and supplements. For those looking for Chinese herbs or supplement advice only, I am happy to offer 30 minute consultations which include comprehensive history gathering, tongue and pulse diagnosis and palpation. $50 for 30 minute consult, not including herbs Yoga Privates Uncover personal patterns and their relationship to musculoskeletal and internal imbalances in the body. In these private consultations we'll take a deep look at posture, breathing, gate and spinal structure to highlight patterns and empower you with appropriate and effective poses to counter these variances and help you rediscover your core in relationship to the neutrality of the spine. Disrupting any dependency on analgesics, massage, acupuncture, chiropractic, Rolfing, etc by giving you an active role in your own healing. $35 30 minute session added onto Acupuncture treatment. \"I am recovering from a serious illness, and dedicated to try Megan Lott's Acupuncture Face-lift. I have never tried Acupuncture before and was ready for a rejuvenated face and spirit. These sessions not only greatly improved my facial structure and appearance, they are truly taking my full body healing to the next level! I have found every session to be nurturing for my mind, body and spirit. I am only on session 6 of 10 and I am so happy that I discovered these treatments. "}
