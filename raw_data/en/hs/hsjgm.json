Like everything at Bio Energy, our approach to chronic illness involves looking for and treating the source of that illness. Whether a person is dealing with heart disease, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, digestive disorders, diabetes, autoimmune issues, or a host of other chronic illness, this approach is very useful. Covering up symptoms with medications tends to create further problems and never addresses the underlying illness. The chronic illness usually involves issues in one or more of these areas: hormone/thyroid imbalance, chronic hidden (stealth) infection, immune/gut dysfunction, sleep dysfunction, nutritional imbalance, toxicity, or lack of exercise. Our job is to identify which of those issues are contributing to the chronic illness and determine the best way to treat them. India is in need of help during this Covid-19 crisis.
