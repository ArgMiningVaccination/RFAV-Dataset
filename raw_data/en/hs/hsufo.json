If you're stuck at home for a little while due to social distancing, why not take up some new hobbies? Meditation is not only great for relaxation, but it turns out it's also great for your immune system too. Inflammation is not your friend \u2014 but meditation is Chronic stress weakens your immune system, making you more susceptible to viruses, bacteria, and other nasty stuff. We all know that eating healthy and getting enough sleep can help to offset some of that, but meditation is linked to an increase in cytokines, which play an essential role in the immune system response. One of the ways that the immune system responds to stress is through inflammation. Inflammation can be a helpful early response to injury or infection (think of the swelling that occurs when you get a cut). This inflammation is caused by proteins known as pro-inflammatory cytokines. A little inflammation is good, but chronic inflammation, which comes from chronic stress, is bad. It weakens the immune system, leading to inflammatory illnesses like arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome, and increasing your risk for type-2 diabetes and heart disease. Several studies have shown that participation in a mindfulness meditation program can [reduce the number of anti-inflammatory cytokines.](https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/ws/portalfiles/portal/36713701/30743012_Health_Benefits_of_Meditation_Special_Issue_Book.pdf) The brain-body link is clear. We know that meditation reduces stress, and now we see that it allows the body to heal itself and can potentially prevent infection. Natural Born Killers Natural Killer cells are white blood cells that serve as one of the first lines of defense in your immune system. They are the cells that target and kill abnormal cells like cancer and atypical cells like those infected by a virus. Natural Killers are important for fighting the flu. In two studies, [where participants actually volunteered to sniff live influenza,](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/06/180613205255.htm) they were able to show that those participants with high baselines of Natural Killers were far better able to fight off the flu. At least one small study has shown that [meditation may be able to "}
