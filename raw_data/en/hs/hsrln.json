Cyclin-dependent kin ase CDK5 has a 60% structural homology with other CDK family members, although it does not func tionally interact with cyclins or affect the mitoti c process. CDK5 is activated in the presence of p35 and p39 proteins, which are shown to be expressed i n normal and cancerous pancreatic cell lines. This s tudy shows that blockade of CDK5, by expression of a dominant-negative version of the protein, leads to decreased motility, invasion, and anchorage- independent growth in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Also, xenograft studies suggest that expression o f dominant-negative CDK5 reduces the size and metasta tic potential of orthotopically engrafted pancreati c cancer cells. Further, results suggest that CDK5 fu nctions through the K-ras pathway, via RalA and Ral B. Strikingly, reactivation of the Ral molecules can \" rescue\" the activities inhibited by dominant-negati ve CDK5 expression. Stereotactic Beneficial in Pancreatic Cance r http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/DDW/199 42 Stereotactic radiosurgery may be an alternative for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer t hat is traditionally unresectable. It is usually limite d to head and neck surgery, particularly brain tumo rs but is used in pancreatic cancer because it can deliver ra diation to one location minimizing damage to surrounding tissue. In this study, patients treated with stereotactic surgery had a local tumor contro l rate of about 90%; researchers note this is a high value compared to conventional treatment. High Intra-abdominal Fat Associated with Increased Pancreatic Cancer Mortality http://www.hemonctoday.com/article.aspx?rid=63944 Although BMI was not a significant predictor for su rvival in patients with pancreatic cancer, research ers at Baylor College of Medicine found that elevated leve ls of intra-abdominal fat increased the risk for de ath as much as fourfold in some patients. BMI was post ulated to be a poor predictor of prognosis because it does not show physicians where fat is distributed i n obese patients. Fat inside the abdomen is hypothesized to be a better predictor of outcome in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. The researchers concluded that patients with more visce ral fat are at greater risk for death. People with Inflammatory Bowel Disease May be at In creased Risk for Pancreatic Cancer http://www.webmd.com/ibd-crohns-disease/news/201005 05/ibd-may-raise-risk-of-pancreatic- cancer?src=RSS_PUBLIC University of Utah researchers noticed that pancrea tic cancer seemed to be developing at higher-than- normal rates in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pa tients and their family members. Data were examined for 2,877 adults treated for IBD at the Un iversity of Utah Health System between 1996 and 2006, along with information from the Utah Cancer R egistry and the Utah Population Database. People with IBD had a 3.36-fold higher risk of pancreatic cancer. Those with ulcerative colitis had a 4.85-fo ld greater risk of pancreatic cancer. Men with IBD had a 6.22-fold higher risk of pancreatic cancer, but women with IBD did not appear to be at increased ri sk for pancreatic cancer. This study does not prove cause and effect, and further research is needed to confirm and validate these findings. Big Belly Raises a Woman's Pancreatic Cancer Risk http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_9 8615.html While a link between obesity and pancreatic cancer is suggested, studies looking at the association ha ve yielded mixed results. New York University research ers report on results of a recent study that showed where a person carries their extra weight may influ ence their risk of pancreatic cancer. People -- especially women -- with more fat around their wais tline are at increased risk of the disease. For all study Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 2141 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 7000 | El Segundo, CA 90245 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan.org subjects, there was a positive link between increas ing BMI and increasing risk for pancreatic cancer. Overall, the researchers found, people in the top f ourth based on their BMI were at 33% higher risk of pancreatic cancer than those in the bottom fourth. High Carbohydrate Diet and Pancreatic Cancer http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64J6002010052 0 One of the first symptoms of pancreatic cancer -- o ften noticed even years before diagnosis -- is indigestion. A new study suggests that these timely tummy troubles may be enough to explain away previous links made between a high carbohydrate die t and an increased risk of the disease. Heavy Alcohol Use, Binge Drinking, Might Increase R isk of Pancreatic Cancer http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-05/usmc -hau051810.php Research from UT Southwestern Medical Center sugges ts heavy alcohol use and binge drinking could increase the risk of pancreatic cancer in men. Res earchers found that the more alcohol a man consumed, the higher his risk of pancreatic cancer. Men who consumed alcohol increased their risk of pancreatic cancer by 1.5 to 6 times compared with t hose who didn't consume alcohol or who had less than one drink per month. The increased risk depend ed on the amount and frequency of alcohol consumption. Researchers found that the risk was gr eater no matter when in the past heavy drinking occurred. They also found that men who engaged in b inge drinking had a 3.5 times greater likelihood of developing pancreatic cancer. They did not find the association among women, possibly due to the lower proportion of women who reported heavy or binge dri nking. Quality-of-Life Testing May Predict Malignancy and Survival in Patients with Pancreatic Disease http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100503 090143.htm According to a study by Henry Ford Hospital, qualit y-of-life measures used routinely to assess treatme nt outcomes for patients with pancreatic disease may b e used to predict both malignancy and survival for those patients. Researchers found that pre-treatme nt quality-of-life scores could predict malignancy in patients with pancreatic lesions and survival in th ose who are found to have malignancies. Their findi ngs suggest that pretreatment quality-of-life scores ma y show which patients will have a poor survival and therefore could avoid aggressive, but futile, treat ment. Suicide Risk and Cancer: Treat the Mind and Body http://www.hemonctoday.com/article.aspx?rid=64155 Among the psychological factors associated with a c ancer diagnosis is an increased risk for suicide among cancer patients and survivors. Depression may be an important marker in identifying patients most likely to commit suicide. In addition to depr ession and feelings of hopelessness, there are othe r factors strongly associated with suicide ideation. Older white men, particularly those who are unmarri ed, are among the patients most likely to have suicidal thoughts. Pancreatic Cancer Breakthrough http://www.abc2news.com/mediacenter/local.aspx?vide oId=22935&navCatId=14 This is a news story about Sinai Hospital's success using stereotactic radiosurgery (Cyberknife) in treating unresectable pancreatic cancer patients. Effects of 5-FU and Heparin-Based Portal Infusion C hemotherapy Combined with Mitomycin C and After Curative with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and heparin-ba sed portal infusion chemotherapy combined with systemic administration of mitomycin C and cisplati n following surgery is feasible and could become a promising adjuvant therapy in patients with potenti ally curative resection of pancreatic cancer. President's Cancer Panel - Reducing Environmental C ancer Risk http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/pcp/pcp08-09rpt /PCP_Report_08-09_508.pdf The President's Cancer Panel dedicated its 2008-200 9 activities to examining the impact of environmental factors on cancer risk. The Panel con sidered industrial, occupational, and agricultural exposures as well as exposures related to medical p ractice, military activities, modern lifestyles, an d natural sources. The Panel was particularly concern ed to find that the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated.

Map Tracks Incidences of Cancer throughout New York State http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/11/nyregion/11map.ht ml New York unveiled what it billed as the nation's fi rst comprehensive statewide cancer map, which becam e available Monday on the Web site of the State Depar tment of Health. The interactive map allows users t o see the count of incidences of various types of can cer in different census blocks. For instance, rand omly highlighting a four-square-block area of Brooklyn s hows 23 cases of cancer out of 1,195 residents, wit h pancreatic and uterine cancers the most prevalent. How Cancer Cells Lose Their (Circadian) Rhythm http://www.acor.org/news/display.html?id=9502 Immortality and uncontrolled cell division are the fundamental differences between cancer cells and normal cells. A widely held explanation for these d ifferences is that the biological clocks in cancer cells are damaged and can't regulate cell division in the fashion that they do in normal cells. This assumpt ion is challenged by the reported experiment that has cont inuously monitored variations in the rate of cell division for extended periods. Insurance Coverage Expanding for Cancer Clinical Tr ials http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/051810/page 5 The movement to push for adopting laws or other for mal agreements requiring coverage for the cost of \"routine care\" received in clinical trials culminat ed in March with the enactment of the Patient Prote ction and Affordable Care Act. This act requires health insurers to pay for routine costs of care delivered in phase I through phase IV clinical trials. The new r equirement does not take effect until 2014, but onc e in effect, the new law will offer a baseline of covera ge for clinical trial participants in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and help plug some gaps in exi sting state-level laws and agreements. Taking Action to Diversify Clinical Cancer Research http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/051810/page 7 Only 3 to 5% of adults with cancer in the U.S. join clinical trials; close to 90% of those who do enro ll in NCI-sponsored studies are white. Less than 6% are H ispanic/Latino. Minority, rural, elderly, and other underserved patient populations bear a heavy burden of cancer disease but remain underrepresented in clinical trials,\" says Dr. Jean Ford, from Johns Ho pkins. This finding limits the benefits of clinica l trials as a treatment option, and potentially compromises the ability to generalize trial results. The article s hares several of the approaches the NCI is using to incre ase the enrollment of minority and underserved patients in clinical trials. Why Don't More Medical Discoveries Become Cures? http://www.newsweek.com/id/238078/ From 1996 to 1999, the U.S. food and Drug Administr ation approved 157 new drugs. In the comparable time frame a decade later (2006 to 2009), the agenc y approved 74. Not among them were any cures, or even meaningfully effective treatments, for Alzheim er's, lung or pancreatic cancer, or a host of other afflictions that destroy lives. More and more polic ymakers and patients are therefore asking, \"Where a re the cures?\" The answer is that potential cures, or at least treatments, are stuck in the chasm between a scientific discovery and the doctor's office: what' s been called the \"valley of death\". Private founda tions like MMRF and the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Par kinson's Research are veering away from the NIH model of \"here's some money, go discover something\" to instead managing and directing researchers more closely, requiring data sharing and cooperatio n and related work that is required after a discove ry is made. Abstracts Novel STAT3 Phosphorylation Inhibitors Exhibit Pote nt Growth-Suppressive Activity in Pancreatic and Breast Cancer Cells http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20215512 The JAK/STAT pathway is frequently activated in hum an cancer, and is therefore an attractive therapeut ic target. Dr. Lin (recipient of a 2009 Pancreatic Ca ncer Action Network - AACR Pilot Grant) and colleagues developed novel inhibitors of STAT3 dime rization (necessary for activity), which are derive d from curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric. Results suggest that the compounds FLLL31 and Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 2141 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 7000 | El Segundo, CA 90245 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan.org FLLL32 are effective inhibitors of JAK2/STAT3 in pa ncreatic and breast cancer cell lines, leading to decreased growth, anchorage-independence, and invas ion. Preliminary in vivo studies suggest that these drugs may have anti-angiogenic properties as well. Primary Cilia Regulate Gli/Hedgehog Activation in P ancreas http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20479231 This study was coauthored by Dr. Matthias Hebrok, t he recipient of the 2008 Michael C. Sandler - Pancreatic Cancer Action Network - AACR Pilot Grant . The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway has been implicated in aiding pancreatic organogenesis and the developm ent of pancreatic tumors. However, previous studies did not differentiate between epithelial an d mesenchymal expression of Hh. In this study, the authors develop a mouse model with constitutively a ctivated GLI (the transcriptional regulator of the Hh pathway), localized to the pancreatic epithelium. S urprisingly, they find a lack of Hh activity in the mouse pancreata. Hh activity in the presence of activate d GLI can be stimulated by blocking the primary cil ia in these cells, leading to enhanced exocrine and endoc rine pancreatic function. Notch1 Functions as a Tumor Suppressor in a Model o f K-ras Induced Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20484026 This article was coauthored by Dr. Ben Stanger, rec ipient of the 2007 Ralph H. Hruban, MD - Pancreatic Cancer Action Network - AACR Career Development Awa rd. Observations that Notch is expressed and active in some pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PD AC) cases, whereas its expression is absent from normal adult pancreatic tissue, have suggested that Notch may behave as an oncogene. To test this, th e authors created mice with mutant K-ras and the abse nce of Notch expression. Rather than observing decreased tumor formation, the K-ras-mutant, Notch- null mice exhibited a greater number of pancreatic lesions, that were also more aggressive than those observed in the K-ras-mutant, Notch-intact mice. Therefore, the conclusion from this report is that Notch behaves as a tumor suppressor, rather than an oncogene, in the context of mutated K-ras-induced P DAC. Impact of Race, Age, and Socioeconomic Status on Pa rticipation in Pancreatic Cancer Clinical Trials http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20467351 Patients enrolled on clinical trials were younger, had better socioeconomic status, and were less ofte n African American. Patients with APC treated at acad emic institutions may have longer OS than patients treated in the community. Clinical trials seem to o ffer a survival advantage for patients with APC. Long Term Follow-up of Resected Pancreatic Cancer P atients Following Vaccination Against Mutant K-Ras http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20473937 K-ras mutations are frequently found in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and can elicit mutation-specific immune responses. Targeting the immune system again st mutant Ras may influence the clinical course of the disease. Twenty-three patients who were vacc inated after surgical resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma were followed for more than 10 years . Median survival for all patients was 27.5 months and 28 months for immune responders. The 5-year sur vival was 22% and 29%, respectively. was 20%, indicating that K-ras vac cination may consolidate the effect of surgery and represent an adjuvant treatment option for the futu re. Prognostic Relevance of CA 19-9, CEA, CRP, and LDH Kinetics in Patients Treated with Palliative Second-Line Therapy for Advanced Pancreatic Cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20480409 The study examined serum biomarkers that could serv e as surrogate survival endpoints during second- line treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. A pr etreatment value and one measurement during second-line treatment for CA 19-9, CEA, CRP, and LD H had to be available in order to evaluate the prognostic role on overall survival. Results indic ate that an increase of >20% during treatment was significantly related to worse overall survival for CA 19-9, CEA, and CRP. Serum biomarker kinetics mi ght serve as useful prognostic tools during second-line chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 2141 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 7000 | El Segundo, CA 90245 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan.org Surgical Pancreatic Islet Cell Carcinomas http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20480251 Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program was assessed for patients with islet cell cancers between 1982 to 2006. Two hundred thirty-six patien ts were identified; 86 patients underwent curative- intent surgery with median survival for local, regi onal, and distant disease of 17.3, 12.2, and 4.0 ye ars, respectively. In comparison, 102 patients underwent medical management alone; survival was significantly shorter when compared to the surgical cohort. Although patients with metastatic disease had 3-year longer survival with adjuvant chemotherapy, these improvements were not statistically significa nt. Surgical resection was associated with improved sur vival compared to medical management for any extent of disease in patients with islet cell cance r, but adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated wit h survival. New Drugs in Neuroendocrine Tumors: Rise of New The rapeutic Philosophies? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20473165 This review focuses on recent progress in the treat ment of neuroendocrine tumors, new agents and the optimization/improvement of currently available the rapies. Pilot Study of Blood Biomarker Candidates for Detec tion of Pancreatic Cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20467349 The results suggest that biomarker candidates could fail in various steps of biomarker development. Earlier knowledge of candidate biomarker flaws coul d lead to strategies to overcome the flaw or alternatively lead to earlier termination of biomar kers that are prone to failure in the later phases of validation testing. Phase II and Coagulation Cascade Biomarker Study of Bevacizumab With or Without Docetaxel ` http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20458210 Treatment options are limited for advanced pancreat ic cancer progressive after gemcitabine therapy. Th e vascular endothelial growth factor pathway is biolo gically important in pancreatic cancer, and docetax el has modest antitumor activity. Researchers evaluate d the role of bevacizumab as second-line treatment for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. No confirmed objective responses were observed and th e study was stopped. Bevacizumab with or without doce taxel does not in gemcitabine-refractory metastatic . Mass Index, and Pancre atic Cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20458087 Obesity has been proposed as a risk factor for panc reatic cancer. Pooled data from the National Cancer Institute Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium (PanS can) was analyzed to study the association between prediagnostic anthropometric measures and r isk of pancreatic cancer. 2,170 cases and 2,209 control subjects were studied. A positive associati on between increasing BMI and risk of pancreatic cancer was observed. In men, the adjusted odds rati o for pancreatic cancer for the highest vs lowest quartile of BMI was 1.33 and in women it was 1.34. Increased waist to hip ratio was associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer in women but le ss so in men. These findings provide strong support for a positive association between BMI and pancreat ic cancer risk. In addition, centralized fat distri bution may increase pancreatic cancer risk, especially in women. Mistletoe Therapy: Friend or Foe in Established Ant i-Tumor Protocols? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20455850 Mistletoe is often used as complementary therapy in oncology. The anti-tumor effects of mistletoe (Iscador) are well documented in-vitro. The clinica l activity of mistletoe treatment remains still controversial. The researchers report on the result s of a multicenter study of pancreatic cancer patie nts who following surgery were treated by adjuvant chem otherapy with gemcitabine supported by mistletoe, or with gemcitabine alone, or any other best of car e, but not including mistletoe. Phase II Study of Gemcitabine Plus Radiotherapy Ver sus Gemcitabine, 5-Fluorouracil, and Radiotherapy and 5-Fluorourac il http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20461765 A randomized phase II trial was conducted to assess toxicities and surgical resection rates in two neoadjuvant gemcitabine-based chemoradiation regime ns in patients with borderline resectable Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 2141 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 7000 | El Segundo, CA 90245 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan.org pancreatic cancer. While the trial was terminated e arly due to poor accrual, it showed that both regim ens were tolerable, and respectability and survival wer e comparable to previous studies. Available Carboydrates, Glycemic Load, and Pancreat ic Cancer: Is There http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20452999 High-carbohydrate diets have been linked to pancrea tic cancer risk in case-control studies, but prospective studies have shown mostly null results. The authors investigated the associations of glyce mic load, glycemic index, and carbohydrate intake with pancreatic cancer risk. Phase II Study of PX-12 in Patients with Advanced C ancer of the Pancreas Following Progression After a Gemcitabine-Containing Combination http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20461382 This study evaluated PX-12, a novel small molecule inhibitor of the proto-oncogene in patients with previously treated advanced pancreatic cancer. Due to the lack of significant antitumor activity, the study was terminated early. PX-12 does not appear to be a ctive in unselected patients with previously treate d advanced pancreatic cancer. Phase I Study of the Biomodulation of Capecitabine, Docetaxel and Gemcitabine (mGTX) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20461379 Researchers studied the three drug combination of g emcitabine (G), docetaxel (T) and capecitabine (X) (mGTX) with schedule modification to maximize biomo dulation of X. This results demonstrate acceptable tolerability with interesting activity in patients with pancreatic cancer. Multicenter Phase I-II Trial of Capecitabine and Ox aliplatin in Combination with Radiotherapy http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20451275 Researchers evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of capecitabine and oxaliplatin followed by the combination of these two drugs with radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced pancreatic or bilia ry tract cancer. Two cycles of XELOX (capecitabine + o xaliplatin) were followed with capecitabine and oxaliplatin). XELOX -RT was well tolerated and effective for locally advanced pancreatic and biliary tract cancer. Impact of S-1 in Patients with Gemcitabine-Refracto ry Pancreatic Cancer in Japan http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20462979 Researchers investigated the impact of S-1 on the p rognosis of patients with gemcitabine-refractory pancreatic cancer. Second-line chemotherapy was adm inistered to 34 patients: 29 using S-1, four using 5-fluorouracil-based chemoradiation, and one using 5-fluorouracil. The introduction of S-1 might impro ve the prognosis of patients with gemcitabine-refracto ry pancreatic cancer. Impact of Obesity on Perioperative Outcomes and Sur vival Following Pancreaticoduodenectomy http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20431978 Obese patients had similar tumor-specific character istics, as well as perioperative outcomes, compared with normal weight patients. However, obese patient s undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer had an improved long-term surviva l independent of known clinicopathologic factors. Ultraviolet B Irradiance and Vitamin D Status are I nversely Associated with Incidence Rates of Pancreatic Cancer Worldwide http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20442683 Countries with lower ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance had higher incidence rates of pancreatic cancer in both hemispheres, with occasional exceptions. Adjuvant Therapy Outcomes for Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20446118 Curative-intent surgery for pancreatic cancer at la rge academic institutions can have very low mortali ty rates. Pathology findings are valuable prognostic m arkers in resected pancreatic cancer. Few studies have examined the prognostic value of preoperative LFTs or lymph node ratio, and the analysis indicate s they may have prognostic value. This should be conf irmed in other series. Patients who receive adjuvan t therapy (chemo-XRT or chemotherapy) appear to live longer than patients who receive no adjuvant therapy in this retrospective analysis. Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 2141 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 7000 | El Segundo, CA 90245 advances in computed tomograp hy (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging, the involvement of the celiac or mesenteric artery in p ancreatic cancer remains uncertain in many cases. Infiltration of these vessels is important in makin g decisions about therapy choices but often can onl y be definitively determined through laparotomy. Local ( intraarterial) ultrasound may increase diagnostic accuracy. Endoscopic Ultrasound in Solid Pancreatic Masses http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20432768 Over two decades ago endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) wa s introduced into clinical practice for better visualization of the pancreas. At the time of intro duction, EUS was superior to other methods of detec tion of pancreatic masses, allowing tissue diagnosis by later introduced EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA). The aim of this review was to discuss the cu rrent evidence of clinical impact of EUS and EUS-FN A in evaluation of solid pancreatic masses, with spec ial emphasis on differentiation between benign and malignant pancreatic lesions.
