Participants of the Clean Energy Program are required to apply to the applicable EmPOWER Maryland incentive program: for market rate applicants, Pepco's Home performance with ENERGY STAR Program, or for income-qualified applicants, the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development's (DHCD) Low Income Energy Efficiency Program (LIEEP). Grants will be available to offset the costs of measures as recommended by a home energy assessment, to facilitate implementation of efficiency measures - funds may also be used to address challenges that would prevent the adoption of recommended efficiency measures. Upon completion of energy efficiency upgrades, residents in ERC designated communities may apply for solar PV and/or solar water heater grants. The Clean Energy Program, Energy Efficiency grant award provides up to $7,500 in funds for residential energy efficiency measures, in addition to Pepco and Washington Gas incentives. The maximum grant award amount is $7,500 (for gas and electric incentives), of which $5,000 can be allocated towards electric incentives and $2,500 toward natural gas incentives, and up to 50% of total grant award amount ($3,750) can be allocated towards air sealing and insulation (does not include ancillary equipment like baffles/ventilation). SOLAR PV GRANT This grant award, coupled with state energy incentives, aids residents to access the benefits of solar photovoltaic (PV) and/or solar water heater upon the successful implementation of energy-efficiency (electricity and natural gas) measures. It also builds on Maryland and Prince George's County's energy-efficiency and carbon reduction goals and will help in making our County more energy resilient, using a holistic approach to break energy and cost barriers. The incentive amount depends on whether the system is owned by the homeowner or a third-party: A. If system is owned by the homeowner: - Grant awards up to $10,000 to cover eligible costs associated with installing a solar photovoltaic system. - Grant awards up to $2,000 to purchase and install a solar power outlet in case of grid failure. B. For third-party owned systems: - Grant awards up to $2,000 to cover eligible costs associated with installing a solar photovoltaic system. - Grant awards up to $2,000 to purchase and install a solar power outlet in case of grid failure. Eligible costs include any parts, component, or accessory equipment necessary to operate and/or install the device. A maximum of 15% of the grant award can be spent on reasonable measures to facilitate the installation of the system on a home (for example, tree trimming). DoE Sustainable Energy staff should be contacted to ensure the measure(s) qualifies. SOLAR WATER HEATER GRANT This grant award, coupled with state energy incentives, aids residents to access the benefits of solar photovoltaic (PV) and/or solar water heater upon the successful implementation of energy-efficiency (electricity and natural gas) measures. It also builds on Maryland and Prince George's County's energy-efficiency and carbon reduction goals and will help in making our County more energy resilient, using a holistic approach to break energy and cost barriers. The incentive amount depends on whether the solar water heating system is owned by the homeowner or a third-party. A. If system is owned by the homeowner: - Grant awards up to $7,500 to cover eligible costs associated with installing a solar water heater. B. For third-party owned systems: - Grant awards up to $2,000 to cover eligible costs associated with installing a solar water heater. Eligible costs include any parts, component, or accessory equipment necessary to operate and/or install the device. A maximum of 15% of the grant award can be spent on reasonable measures to facilitate the installation of the system on a home. DoE Sustainable Energy staff should be contacted to ensure the measure(s) qualifies. ENERGY STAR CERTIFICATION & GREEN LEASING GRANT ENERGY STAR certified buildings save energy, save money, and help protect the environment by generating fewer greenhouse gas emissions than comparable buildings. Further, a building's energy usage and efficiency are increasingly becoming factors to attract new, and to retain existing, tenants. ENERGY STAR certification can help to increase a building's value and generate more income when compared to similar buildings. The ENERGY STAR Certification and Green Leasing (ESGL) grant award seeks to increase the number of ENERGY STAR certified buildings and encourage the adoption of green-leasing practices within Prince George's County. This effort will help support the County's goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and attract and retain high-valued tenants in the county. Maximum award available per application: $150,000 The following incentives are available to qualified applicants: - Of the $150,000, if required, up to $50,000 will cover the ASHRAE Level 2 Audit and shall not exceed this amount. - Grant awards to cover up to $100,000 for Electric and or Natural Gas measures. - Grant awards to cover up to $150,000 for Electric and or Natural Gas measures, if ASHRAE Level 2 Audit is not required. - Grant awards to offset 100% of the cost of the Licensed Professional's sign off to verify and stamp the ENERGY STAR certification application.
