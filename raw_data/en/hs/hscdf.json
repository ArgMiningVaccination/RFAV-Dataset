Photographs of missing children se- lected by the Center may appear in this publication on pa- ges that would otherwise be blank. You can help bring these children home by looking at the photographs and calling 800 -THE- LOST (800 -843- 5678) if you recognize a child. Introduction This publication explains the itemized deduction for medi- cal and dental expenses that you claim on Schedule A (Form 1040). It discusses what expenses, and whose ex- penses, you can and can't include in figuring the deduc- tion. It explains how to treat reimbursements and how to figure the deduction. It also tells you how to report the de- duction on your tax return and what to do if you sell medi- cal property or receive damages for a personal injury. Medical expenses include dental expenses, and in this publication the term \"medical expenses\" is often used to refer to medical and dental expenses. You can deduct on Schedule A (Form 1040) only the part of your medical and dental expenses that is more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). This publication also explains how to treat impair- ment- related work expenses and health insurance premi- ums if you are self-employed. Pub. 502 covers many common medical expenses but not every possible medical expense. If you can't find the expense you are looking for, refer to the definition of medi- cal expenses under What Are Medical Expenses , later.

Medical expenses are the costs of diagnosis, cure, mitiga- tion, treatment, or prevention of disease, and for the pur- pose of affecting any part or function of the body. These expenses include payments for legal medical services rendered by physicians, surgeons, dentists, and other medical practitioners. They include the costs of equip- ment, supplies, and diagnostic devices needed for these purposes. Medical care expenses must be primarily to alleviate or prevent a physical or mental disability or illness. They don't include expenses that are merely beneficial to gen- eral health, such as vitamins or a vacation. Medical expenses include the premiums you pay for in- surance that covers the expenses of medical care, and the amounts you pay for transportation to get medical care. Medical expenses also include amounts paid for qualified long -term care services and limited amounts paid for any qualified long-term care insurance contract. What Expenses Can You Include This Year? You can include only the medical and dental expenses you paid this year, but generally not payments for medical or dental care you will receive in a future year. (But see Decedent under Whose Medical Expenses Can You In- clude , later, for an exception.) This is not the rule for de- termining whether an expense can be reimbursed by a 969 1040 1040-SR Schedule A (Form 1040) 8962 Page 2 3 of 28 Fileid: ... tions/p502/2022/a/xml/cycle03/source 10:40 - 6-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. flexible spending arrangement (FSA). If you pay medical expenses by check, the day you mail or deliver the check is generally the date of payment. If you use a \"pay-by- phone\" or \"online\" account to pay your medical expenses, the date reported on the statement of the finan- cial institution showing when payment was made is the date of payment. If you use a credit card, include medical expenses you charge to your credit card in the year the charge is made, not when you actually pay the amount charged. If you didn't claim a medical or dental expense that would have been deductible in an earlier year, you can file Form 1040 -X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Re- turn, to claim a refund for the year in which you over- looked the expense. Don't claim the expense on this year's return. Generally, a claim for refund must be filed within 3 years from the date the original return was filed or within 2 years from the time the tax was paid, whichever is later. You can't include medical expenses that were paid by insurance companies or other sources. This is true whether the payments were made directly to you, to the patient, or to the provider of the medical services. Separate returns. If you and your spouse live in a non- community property state and file separate returns, each of you can include only the medical expenses each ac- tually paid. Any medical expenses paid out of a joint checking account in which you and your spouse have the same interest are considered to have been paid equally by each of you, unless you can show otherwise. Community property states. If you and your spouse live in a community property state and file separate re- turns or are registered domestic partners in Nevada, Washington, or California, any medical expenses paid out of community funds are divided equally. Generally, each of you should include half the expenses. If medical expen- ses are paid out of the separate funds of one individual, only the individual who paid the medical expenses can in- clude them. If you live in a community property state and aren't filing a joint return, see Pub. 555, Community Prop- erty. How Much of the Expenses Can You Deduct? Generally, you can deduct on Schedule A (Form 1040) only the amount of your medical and dental expenses that is more than 7.5% of your AGI. Whose Medical Expenses Can You Include? You can generally include medical expenses you pay for yourself, as well as those you pay for someone who was your spouse or your dependent either when the services were provided or when you paid for them. There are differ- ent rules for decedents and for individuals who are the subject of multiple support agreements. See Support claimed under a multiple support agreement , later, under Qualifying Relative . Spouse You can include medical expenses you paid for your spouse. To include these expenses, you must have been married either at the time your spouse received the medi- cal services or at the time you paid the medical expenses. Example 1. Taxpayer A received medical treatment before marrying Taxpayer B. B paid for the treatment after they married. B can include these expenses in figuring B's medical expense deduction even if B and A file separate returns. If A had paid the expenses, B couldn't include A's ex- penses on B's separate return. The amounts A paid dur- ing the year would be included on A's separate return. If they filed a joint return, the medical expenses both paid during the year would be used to figure their medical ex- pense deduction. Example 2. This year, Taxpayer X paid medical ex- penses for Taxpayer Y, the spouse, who died last year. X married Taxpayer Z this year and they file a joint return. Because X was married to Y when Y received the medical services, X can include those expenses in figuring X's medical expense deduction for this year. Dependent You can include medical expenses you paid for your de- pendent. For you to include these expenses, the person must have been your dependent either at the time the medical services were provided or at the time you paid the expenses. A person generally qualifies as your dependent for purposes of the medical expense deduction if both of the following requirements are met. 1.The person was a qualifying child (defined later) or a qualifying relative (defined later). 2.The person was a U.S. citizen or national or a resident of the United States, Canada, or Mexico. If your quali- fying child was adopted, see Exception for adopted child , later. You can include medical expenses you paid for an individ- ual that would have been your dependent except that: 1.The person received gross income of $4,400 or more in 2022; 2.The person filed a joint return for 2022; or 3.You, or your spouse if filing jointly, could be claimed as a dependent on someone else's 2022 return. Exception for adopted child. If you are a U.S. citizen or national and your adopted child lived with you as a mem- ber of your household for 2022, that child doesn't have to Publication 502 (2022) Page 4 of 28 Fileid: ... tions/p502/2022/a/xml/cycle03/source 10:40 - 6-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. be a U.S. citizen or national, or a resident of the United States, Canada, or Mexico. Qualifying Child A qualifying child is a child who: 1.Is your son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, half brother, half sister, or a descendant of any of them (for example, your grandchild, niece, or nephew); 2.Was: a.Under age 19 at the end of 2022 and younger than you (or your spouse if filing jointly), b.Under age 24 at the end of 2022, a full-time stu- dent, and younger than you (or your spouse if fil- ing jointly), or c.Any age and permanently and totally disabled; 3.Lived with you for more than half of 2022; 4.Didn't provide over half of their own support for 2022; and 5.Didn't file a joint return, other than to claim a refund. Adopted child. A legally adopted child is treated as your own child. This child includes a child lawfully placed with you for legal adoption. You can include medical expenses that you paid for a child before adoption if the child qualified as your depend- ent when the medical services were provided or when the expenses were paid. If you pay back an adoption agency or other persons for medical expenses they paid under an agreement with you, you are treated as having paid those expenses provi- ded you clearly substantiate that the payment is directly attributable to the medical care of the child. But if you pay the agency or other person for medical care that was provided and paid for before adoption nego- tiations began, you can't include them as medical expen- ses. You may be able to take a credit for other expen- ses related to an adoption. See the Instructions for Form 8839, Qualified Adoption Expenses, for more information. Child of divorced or separated parents. For purposes of the medical and dental expenses deduction, a child of divorced or separated parents can be treated as a de- pendent of both parents. Each parent can include the medical expenses they pay for the child, even if the other parent claims the child's dependency exemption, if: 1.The child is in the custody of one or both parents for more than half the year; 2.The child receives over half of the child's support dur- ing the year from the parents; and 3.The child's parents: TIPa.Are divorced or legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance, b.Are separated under a written separation agree- ment, or c.Live apart at all times during the last 6 months of the year. This doesn't apply if the child's exemption is being claimed under a multiple support agreement (discussed later). Qualifying Relative A qualifying relative is a person: 1.Who is your: a.Son, daughter, stepchild, or foster child, or a de- scendant of any of them (for example, your grand- child), b.Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, or a son or daughter of any of them, c.Father, mother, or an ancestor or sibling of either of them (for example, your grandmother, grandfa- ther, aunt, or uncle), d.Stepbrother, stepsister, stepfather, stepmother, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, or e.Any other person (other than your spouse) who lived with you all year as a member of your house- hold if your relationship didn't violate local law, 2.Who wasn't a qualifying child (see Qualifying Child , earlier) of any taxpayer for 2022, and 3.For whom you provided over half of the support in 2022. But see Child of divorced or separated parents , earlier, Support claimed under a multiple support agreement next, and Kidnapped child under Qualify- ing Relative in Pub. 501, Dependents, Standard De- duction, and Filing Information. Support claimed under a multiple support agree- ment. If you are considered to have provided more than half of a qualifying relative's support under a multiple sup- port agreement, you can include medical expenses you pay for that person. A multiple support agreement is used when two or more people provide more than half of a per- son's support, but no one alone provides more than half. Any medical expenses paid by others who joined you in the agreement can't be included as medical expenses by anyone. However, you can include the entire unreim- bursed amount you paid for medical expenses. Example. You and your three siblings each provide one- fourth of your parent's total support. Under a multiple support agreement, you treat your parent as your depend- ent. You paid all of your parent's medical expenses. Your siblings repaid you for three -fourths of these expenses. In figuring your medical expense deduction, you can include only one -fourth of your parent's medical expenses.

MUST be removed before printing. siblings can't include any part of the expenses. However, if you and your siblings share the nonmedical support items and you separately pay all of your parent's medical expenses, you can include the unreimbursed amount you paid for your parent's medical expenses in your medical expenses. Decedent Medical expenses paid before death by the decedent are included in figuring any deduction for medical and dental expenses on the decedent's final income tax return. This includes expenses for the decedent's spouse and de- pendents as well as for the decedent. The survivor or personal representative of a decedent can choose to treat certain expenses paid by the dece- dent's estate for the decedent's medical care as paid by the decedent at the time the medical services were provi- ded. The expenses must be paid within the 1 -year period beginning with the day after the date of death. If you are the survivor or personal representative making this choice, you must attach a statement to the decedent's Form 1040 or 1040 -SR (or the decedent's amended re- turn, Form 1040- X) saying that the expenses haven't been and won't be claimed on the estate tax return. Qualified medical expenses paid before death by the decedent aren't deductible if paid with a tax-free distribution from any Archer MSA, Medi- care Advantage MSA, or health savings account. What if the decedent's return had been filed and the medical expenses weren't included? Form 1040 -X can be filed for the year or years the expenses are treated as paid, unless the period for claiming a refund has passed. Generally, a claim for refund must be filed within 3 years of the date the original return was filed, or within 2 years from the time the tax was paid, whichever date is later. Example. Taxpayer J properly filed a 2021 income tax return. J died in 2022 with unpaid medical expenses of $1,500 from 2021 and $1,800 in 2022. If the expenses are paid within the 1 -year period, J's survivor or personal rep- resentative can file an amended return for 2021 claiming a deduction based on the $1,500 medical expenses. The $1,800 of medical expenses from 2022 can be included on the decedent's final return for 2022. What if you pay medical expenses of a deceased spouse or dependent? If you paid medical expenses for your deceased spouse or dependent, include them as medical expenses on your Schedule A (Form 1040) in the year paid, whether they are paid before or after the dece- dent's death. The expenses can be included if the person was your spouse or dependent either at the time the medi- cal services were provided or at the time you paid the ex- penses. CAUTION!What Medical Expenses Are Includible? Following is a list of items that you can include in figuring your medical expense deduction. The items are listed in alphabetical order.

Capital Expenses You can include in medical expenses amounts you pay for special equipment installed in a home, or for improve- ments, if their main purpose is medical care for you, your spouse, or your dependent. The cost of permanent im- provements that increase the value of your property may be partly included as a medical expense. The cost of the improvement is reduced by the increase in the value of your property. The difference is a medical expense. If the value of your property isn't increased by the improvement, the entire cost is included as a medical expense. Certain improvements made to accommodate a home to your disabled condition, or that of your spouse or your dependents who live with you, don't usually increase the value of the home and the cost can be included in full as medical expenses. These improvements include, but aren't limited to, the following items. Constructing entrance or exit ramps for your home. Widening doorways at entrances or exits to your home. Widening or otherwise modifying hallways and interior doorways.Installing railings, support bars, or other modifications to bathrooms. Lowering or modifying kitchen cabinets and equip- ment. Moving or modifying electrical outlets and fixtures. Installing porch lifts and other forms of lifts (but eleva- tors generally add value to the house). Modifying fire alarms, smoke detectors, and other warning systems. Modifying stairways. Adding handrails or grab bars anywhere (whether or not in bathrooms). Modifying hardware on doors. Modifying areas in front of entrance and exit door- ways. Grading the ground to provide access to the resi- dence. Only reasonable costs to accommodate a home to your disabled condition are considered medical care. Addi- tional costs for personal motives, such as for architectural or aesthetic reasons, aren't medical expenses. Capital expense worksheet.

MUST be removed before printing. as long as the main reason for them is medical care. This rule applies even if none or only part of the original cost of the capital asset qualified as a medical care expense. Improvements to property rented by a person with a disability. Amounts paid to buy and install special plumbing fixtures for a person with a disability, mainly for medical reasons, in a rented house are medical expen- ses. Example. Taxpayer B has arthritis and a heart condi- tion. B can't climb stairs or get into a bathtub. On the doc- tor's advice, B installs a bathroom with a shower stall on the first floor of B's two -story rented house. The landlord didn't pay any of the cost of buying and installing the spe- cial plumbing and didn't lower the rent. B can include in medical expenses the entire amount B paid. Car You can include in medical expenses the cost of special hand controls and other special equipment installed in a car for the use of a person with a disability. Special design.

Guide Dog or Other Service Animal You can include in medical expenses the costs of buying, training, and maintaining a guide dog or other service ani- mal to assist a visually impaired or hearing disabled per- son, or a person with other physical disabilities. In gen- eral, this includes any costs, such as food, grooming, and veterinary care, incurred in maintaining the health and vi- tality of the service animal so that it may perform its duties. Health Institute You can include in medical expenses fees you pay for treatment at a health institute only if the treatment is pre- scribed by a physician and the physician issues a state- ment that the treatment is necessary to alleviate a physi- cal or mental disability or illness of the individual receiving the treatment. Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) You can include in medical expenses amounts you pay to entitle you, your spouse, or a dependent to receive medi- cal care from an HMO. These amounts are treated as medical insurance premiums. See Insurance Premiums , later. Hearing Aids You can include in medical expenses the cost of a hearing aid and batteries, repairs, and maintenance needed to op- erate it. Home Care See Nursing Services , later.Home Improvements See Capital Expenses , earlier. Hospital Services You can include in medical expenses amounts you pay for the cost of inpatient care at a hospital or similar institution if a principal reason for being there is to receive medical care. This includes amounts paid for meals and lodging. Also see Lodging , later. Insurance Premiums You can include in medical expenses insurance premiums you pay for policies that cover medical care. You can't in- clude in medical expenses insurance premiums that were paid and for which you are claiming a credit or deduction. Medical care policies can provide payment for treatment that includes: Hospitalization, surgical services, X-rays; Prescription drugs and insulin; Dental care; Replacement of lost or damaged contact lenses; and Long-term care (subject to additional limitations). See Qualified Long -Term Care Insurance Contracts under Long-Term Care , later. If you have a policy that provides payments for other than medical care, you can include the premiums for the medical care part of the policy if the charge for the medi- cal part is reasonable. The cost of the medical part must be separately stated in the insurance contract or given to you in a separate statement. Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance Plan Don't include in your medical and dental expenses any in- surance premiums paid by an employer -sponsored health insurance plan unless the premiums are included on your Form W -2, Wage and Tax Statement. Also, don't include any other medical and dental expenses paid by the plan unless the amount paid is included on your Form W-2. Example. You are a federal employee participating in the premium conversion plan of the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) program. Your share of the FEHB premium is paid by making a pre -tax reduction in your sal- ary. Because you are an employee whose insurance pre- miums are paid with money that is never included in your gross income, you can't deduct the premiums paid with that money. Long- term care services. Contributions made by your employer to provide coverage for qualified long -term care services under a flexible spending or similar arrangement must be included in your income. This amount will be re- ported as wages on your Form W-2.

On B's 2022 tax return, B is allowed a premium tax credit of $3,600 and must repay $600 ex- cess advance credit payments (which is less than the re- payment limitation). B is treated as paying $5,100 ($8,700 less the allowed premium tax credit of $3,600) for health insurance premiums in 2022. B will enter $5,100 on Schedule A, line 1. Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 , except B is allowed a premium tax credit of $4,900 on B's tax return and receives a net premium tax credit of $700.

You can't include depreciation, insur- ance, general repair, or maintenance expenses. If you don't want to use your actual expenses for 2022, you can use the standard medical mileage rate. For 2022, the standard medical mileage rate allowed is 18 cents a mile from January 1, 2022, through June 30, 2022, and 22 cents a mile from July 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022. You can also include parking fees and tolls. You can add these fees and tolls to your medical expenses whether you use actual expenses or the standard mileage rate. Example. In 2022, Taxpayer J drove 2,800 miles (1,500 miles before June 30, 2022, and 1,300 miles after July 1, 2022) for medical reasons. J spent $400 for gas, $30 for oil, and $100 for tolls and parking. J wants to fig- ure the amount to include in medical expenses both ways to see which gives the greater deduction. J figures the actual expenses first. J adds the $400 for gas, the $30 for oil, and the $100 for tolls and parking for a total of $530. J then figures the standard mileage amount. J multi- plies 1,500 miles by 18 cents a mile for a total of $270. J multiplies 1,300 miles by 22 cents a mile for a total of $286. J then adds the total $100 tolls and parking and mileage for a total of $656 (270 + 286 + 100). J includes the $656 of car expenses with the other medical expenses for the year because the $656 is more than the $530 figured using actual expenses. Transportation expenses you can't include.

Nonprescription Drugs and Medicines Except for insulin, you can't include in medical expenses amounts you pay for a drug that isn't prescribed. A pre- scribed drug is one that requires a prescription by a doctor for its use by an individual. Example. Your doctor recommends that you take as- pirin. Because aspirin is a drug that doesn't require a physician's prescription for its use by an individual, you can't include its cost in your medical expenses. Nutritional Supplements You can't include in medical expenses the cost of nutri- tional supplements, vitamins, herbal supplements, \"natu- ral medicines,\" etc., unless they are recommended by a medical practitioner as treatment for a specific medical condition diagnosed by a physician. These items are taken to maintain your ordinary good health and aren't for medical care. Personal Use Items You can't include in medical expenses the cost of an item ordinarily used for personal, living, or family purposes un- less it is used primarily to prevent or alleviate a physical or mental disability or illness. For example, the cost of a toothbrush and toothpaste is a nondeductible personal ex- pense. In order to accommodate an individual with a physical disability, you may have to purchase an item ordinarily used as a personal, living, or family item in a special form. You can include the excess of the cost of the item in a special form over the cost of the item in normal form as a medical expense.

You also can't include in medical expen- ses any amount of advance payments of the premium tax credit made that you did not have to pay back. However, any amount of advance payments of the premium tax credit that you did have to pay back can be included in medical expenses. Swimming Lessons See Dancing Lessons , earlier. Teeth Whitening You can't include in medical expenses amounts paid to whiten teeth. See Cosmetic Surgery , earlier. Veterinary Fees You generally can't include veterinary fees in your medical expenses, but see Guide Dog or Other Service Animal un- der What Medical Expenses Are Includible , earlier. Weight-Loss Program You can't include in medical expenses the cost of a weight- loss program if the purpose of the weight loss is the improvement of appearance, general health, or sense of well -being. You can't include amounts you pay to lose weight unless the weight loss is a treatment for a specific disease diagnosed by a physician (such as obesity, hy- pertension, or heart disease). If the weight -loss treatment isn't for a specific disease diagnosed by a physician, you can't include either the fees you pay for membership in a weight- reduction group or fees for attendance at periodic meetings. Also, you can't include membership dues in a gym, health club, or spa. You can't include the cost of diet food or beverages in medical expenses because the diet food and beverages substitute for what is normally consumed to satisfy nutri- tional needs. See Weight -Loss Program under What Medical Expen- ses Are Includible , earlier. How Do You Treat Reimbursements? You can include in medical expenses only those amounts paid during the tax year for which you received no insur- ance or other reimbursement.Insurance Reimbursement You must reduce your total medical expenses for the year by all reimbursements for medical expenses that you re- ceive from insurance or other sources during the year. This includes payments from Medicare. Even if a policy provides reimbursement only for certain specific medical expenses, you must use amounts you re- ceive from that policy to reduce your total medical expen- ses, including those it doesn't reimburse. Example. You have insurance policies that cover your hospital and doctors' bills but not your nursing bills. The insurance you receive for the hospital and doctors' bills is more than their charges. In figuring your medical deduc- tion, you must reduce the total amount you spent for medi- cal care by the total amount of insurance you received, even if the policies don't cover some of your medical ex- penses. Health reimbursement arrangement (HRA). An HRA is an employer-funded plan that reimburses employees for medical care expenses and allows unused amounts to be carried forward. An HRA is funded solely by the employer and the reimbursements for medical expenses, up to a maximum dollar amount for a coverage period, aren't in- cluded in your income. Other reimbursements. Generally, you don't reduce medical expenses by payments you receive for: Permanent loss or loss of use of a member or function of the body (loss of limb, sight, hearing, etc.) or disfig- urement to the extent the payment is based on the na- ture of the injury without regard to the amount of time lost from work, or Loss of earnings. You must, however, reduce your medical expenses by any part of these payments that is designated for medical costs. See How Do You Figure and Report the Deduction on Your Tax Return , later. For how to treat damages received for personal injury or sickness, see Damages for Personal Injuries , later. What if Your Insurance Reimbursement Is More Than Your Medical Expenses? If you are reimbursed more than your medical expenses, you may have to include the excess in income. You may want to use Figure 1 to help you decide if any of your re- imbursement is taxable.

If you pay either the entire pre- mium for your medical insurance or all the costs of a plan similar to medical insurance and your insurance payments or other reimbursements are more than your total medical expenses for the year, you have excess reimbursement. Generally, you don't include the excess reimbursement in your gross income. However, gross income does include total payments in excess of $390 a day ($142,350 for 2022) for qualified long-term care services. Premiums paid by you and your employer. If both you and your employer contribute to your medical insurance plan and your employer's contributions aren't included in your gross income, you must include in your gross income the part of your excess reimbursement that is from your employer's contribution. If you aren't covered by more than one policy, you can figure the amount of the excess reimbursement you must include in gross income using Worksheet B. If you are covered under more than one policy, see More than one policy , later.Excess Reimbursement Includible in Income When You Have Only One PolicyWorksheet B. Keep for Your Records Instructions: Use this worksheet to figure the amount of excess reimbursement you must include in income when both you and your employer contributed to your medical insurance and your employer's contributions aren't included in your gross income. 1.Enter the amount contributed to your medical insurance for the year by your employer ........................ 1. 2.Enter the total annual cost of the policy ............................ 2. 3.Divide line 1 by line 2 ............... 3. 4.Enter the amount of excess reimbursement .................... 4. 5.Multiply line 3 by line 4. This is the amount of the excess reimburse- ment you must include as other income on Form 1040 or 1040-SR ........... 5. Premiums paid by your employer. If your employer or your former employer pays the total cost of your medical insurance plan and your employer's contributions aren't included in your income, you must report all of your ex- cess reimbursement as other income. More than one policy. If you are covered under more than one policy, the cost of at least one of which is paid by both you and your employer, you must first divide the medical expenses among the policies to figure the excess reimbursement from each policy. Then divide the policy costs to figure the part of any excess reimbursement that is from your employer's contribution. Any excess reim- bursement that is due to your employer's contributions is includible in your income. You can figure the part of the excess reimbursement that is from your employer's contribution by using Work- sheet C. Use Worksheet C only if both you and your em- ployer paid part of the cost of at least one policy. If you had more than one policy, but you didn't share in the cost of at least one policy, don't use Worksheet C.

This is the amount of your total excess reimbursement you must report as other income on Form 1040 or 1040-SR ...... 11. What if You Receive Insurance Reimbursement in a Later Year? If you are reimbursed in a later year for medical expenses you deducted in an earlier year, you must generally report the reimbursement as income up to the amount you previ- ously deducted as medical expenses. However, don't report as income the amount of reim- bursement you received up to the amount of your medical deductions that didn't reduce your tax for the earlier year.For more information about the recovery of an amount that you claimed as an itemized deduction in an earlier year, see Recoveries in Pub. 525, Taxable and Nontaxa- ble Income. What if You Are Reimbursed for Medical Expenses You Didn't Deduct? If you didn't deduct a medical expense in the year you paid it because your medical expenses weren't more than 7.5% of your AGI or because you didn't itemize deduc- tions, don't include the reimbursement, up to the amount of the expense, in income. However, if the reimbursement is more than the expense, see What if Your Insurance Re- imbursement Is More Than Your Medical Expenses , ear- lier. How Do You Figure and Report the Deduction on Your Tax Return? Once you have determined which medical expenses you can include, figure and report the deduction on your tax return. What Tax Form Do You Use? You report your medical expense deduction on Sched- ule A (Form 1040). See the Instructions for Schedule A (Form 1040) for more detailed information on figuring your medical and dental expense deduction. Recordkeeping. You should keep records of your medical and dental expenses to support your deduction. Don't send these records with your pa- per return. Sale of Medical Equipment or Property If you deduct the cost of medical equipment or property in one year and sell it in a later year, you may have a taxable gain. The taxable gain is the amount of the selling price that is more than the adjusted basis of the equipment or property. The adjusted basis is the portion of the cost of the equipment or property that you couldn't deduct because of the 7.5% or 10% AGI limit used to figure your medical deduction. Refer to your Schedule A for the year the cost was included to determine which limit applied to you. Use Worksheet D to figure the adjusted basis of the equipment or property. RECORDS Publication 502 (2022) Page 19Page 20 of 28 Fileid: ... tions/p502/2022/a/xml/cycle03/source 10:40 - 6-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Adjusted Basis of Medical Equipment or Property SoldWorksheet D. Keep for Your Records Instructions: Use this worksheet if you deducted the cost of medical equipment or property in one year and sold the equipment or property in a later year. This worksheet will give you the adjusted basis of the equipment or property you sold. 1. Enter the cost of the equipment or property ....................... 1. 2. Enter your total includible medical expenses for the year you included the cost in your medical expenses ..................... 2. 3. Divide line 1 by line 2 ............ 3. 4. Enter 7.5% or 10% of your AGI (whichever applies) for the year the cost was included in your medical expenses ..................... 4. 5. Multiply line 3 by line 4. If your allowable itemized deductions for the year you purchased the equipment or property weren't more than your AGI for that year, stop here. This is the adjusted basis of the equipment or property. If your allowable itemized deductions for the year you purchased the equipment or property were more than your AGI for that year, complete lines 6 through 11............................ 5. 6.

If your allowable itemized deductions for the year you purchased the equipment or property were more than your AGI for that year, this is the adjusted basis of the equipment or property ........... 12. Next, use Worksheet E to figure the total gain or loss on the sale of the medical equipment or property.Gain or Loss on the Sale of Medical Equipment or PropertyWorksheet E. Keep for Your Records Instructions: Use the following worksheet to figure total gain or loss on the sale of medical equipment or property that you deducted in an earlier year. 1.Enter the amount that the medical equipment or property sold for ...... 1. 2.Enter your selling expenses ......... 2. 3.Subtract line 2 from line 1 ........... 3. 4.Enter the adjusted basis of the equipment or property from Worksheet D, line 5, or line 12, if applicable ..... 4. 5.Subtract line 4 from line 3. This is the total gain or loss from the sale of the medical equipment or property ...... 5. If you have a loss, it isn't deductible. If you have a gain, it is includible in your income. The part of the gain that is a recovery of an amount you previously deducted is taxable as ordinary income. Enter it on Form 1040 or 1040 -SR. Any part of the gain that is more than the recovery of an amount you previously deducted is taxable as a capital gain. Enter it on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets, and Schedule D (Form 1040), Capital Gains and Losses. For more information about the recovery of an amount that you claimed as an itemized deduction in an earlier year, see Recoveries in Pub. 525. Damages for Personal Injuries If you receive an amount in settlement of a personal injury suit, part of that award may be for medical expenses that you deducted in an earlier year. If it is, you must include that part in your income in the year you receive it to the ex- tent it reduced your taxable income in the earlier year. See What if You Receive Insurance Reimbursement in a Later Year , discussed earlier under How Do You Treat Reim- bursements. Example. You sued this year for injuries you suffered in an accident last year. You sought $10,000 for your inju- ries and didn't itemize your damages. Last year, you paid $500 for medical expenses for your injuries. You deducted those expenses on last year's tax return. This year you settled your lawsuit for $2,000. Your settlement didn't itemize or allocate the damages. The $2,000 is first pre- sumed to be for the medical expenses that you deducted. The $500 is includible in your income this year because you deducted the entire $500 as a medical expense de- duction last year. Future medical expenses. If you receive an amount in settlement of a damage suit for personal injuries, part of Page 20 Publication 502 (2022)Page 21 of 28 Fileid: ... tions/p502/2022/a/xml/cycle03/source 10:40 - 6-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. that award may be for future medical expenses. If it is, you must reduce any future medical expenses for these inju- ries until the amount you received has been completely used. Example. You were injured in an accident. You sued and sought a judgment of $50,000 for your injuries. You settled the suit for $45,000. The settlement provided that $10,000 of the $45,000 was for future medical expenses for your injuries. You can't include the first $10,000 that you pay for medical expenses for those injuries. Workers' compensation. If you received workers' com- pensation and you deducted medical expenses related to that injury, you must include the workers' compensation in income up to the amount you deducted. If you received workers' compensation, but didn't deduct medical expen- ses related to that injury, don't include the workers' com- pensation in your income. Impairment-Related Work Expenses If you are a person with disabilities, you can take a busi- ness deduction for expenses that are necessary for you to be able to work. If you take a business deduction for these impairment- related work expenses, they aren't subject to the 7.5% limit that applies to medical expenses. You have a disability if you have: A physical or mental disability (for example, blindness or deafness) that functionally limits your being em- ployed; or A physical or mental impairment (for example, a sight or hearing impairment) that substantially limits one or more of your major life activities, such as performing manual tasks, walking, speaking, breathing, learning, or working. Impairment- related expenses defined. Impairment-re- lated expenses are those ordinary and necessary busi- ness expenses that are: Necessary for you to do your work satisfactorily; For goods and services not required or used, other than incidentally, in your personal activities; and Not specifically covered under other income tax laws. Where to report. If you are self -employed, deduct the business expenses on the appropriate form (Schedule C, E, or F) used to report your business income and expen- ses. If you are an employee, complete Form 2106, Em- ployee Business Expenses. Enter on Schedule A (Form 1040) that part of the amount on Form 2106 that is related to your impairment. Example. You are blind. You must use a reader to do your work. You use the reader both during your regular working hours at your place of work and outside your reg- ular working hours away from your place of work. The reader's services are only for your work. You can deduct your expenses for the reader as business expenses. Health Insurance Costs for Self-Employed Persons If you were self-employed and had a net profit for the year, you may be able to deduct, as an adjustment to income, amounts paid for medical and qualified long -term care in- surance on behalf of yourself, your spouse, your depend- ents, and your children who were under age 27 at the end of 2022. For this purpose, you were self -employed if you were a general partner (or a limited partner receiving guar- anteed payments) or you received wages from an S cor- poration in which you were more than a 2% shareholder. The insurance plan must be established under your trade or business and the deduction can't be more than your earned income from that trade or business. You can't deduct payments for medical insurance for any month in which you were eligible to participate in a health plan subsidized by your employer, your spouse's employer, or an employer of your dependent, or your child under age 27, at the end of 2022. You can't deduct pay- ments for a qualified long -term care insurance contract for any month in which you were eligible to participate in a long- term care insurance plan subsidized by your em- ployer or your spouse's employer. If you qualify to take the deduction, use the Self -Em- ployed Health Insurance Deduction Worksheet in the In- structions for Form 1040 to figure the amount you can de- duct. But if any of the following applies, don't use that worksheet. You had more than one source of income subject to self-employment tax. You file Form 2555, Foreign Earned Income. You are using amounts paid for qualified long-term care insurance to figure the deduction. If you can't use the worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1040, use the worksheet in Pub. 535, Business Expenses, to figure your deduction. Use Pub. 974, Premium Tax Credit, instead of the worksheet in the 2022 Instructions for Form 1040 if the in- surance plan established, or considered to be estab- lished, under your business was obtained through the Health Insurance Marketplace and you are claiming the premium tax credit. When figuring the amount you can deduct for insurance premiums, don't include amounts paid for health insur- ance coverage with retirement plan distributions that were tax free because you are a retired public safety officer. Where to report. You take this deduction on Form 1040 or 1040 -SR. If you itemize your deductions and don't claim 100% of your self -employed health insurance costs Publication 502 (2022) Page 21Page 22 of 28 Fileid: ... tions/p502/2022/a/xml/cycle03/source 10:40 - 6-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. on Form 1040 or 1040 -SR, include any remaining premi- ums with all other medical expenses on Schedule A (Form 1040) subject to the 7.5% limit. Child under age 27. If the insurance policy covers your nondependent child who was under age 27 at the end of 2022, you can claim the premiums for that coverage on Form 1040 or 1040 -SR. If you can't claim 100% of your self- employed health insurance costs on Form 1040 or 1040- SR, any excess amounts attributable to that child aren't eligible to be claimed on Schedule A (Form 1040). Generally, family health insurance premiums don't in- crease if coverage for an additional child is added. If this is the situation, no allocation would be necessary. If the premiums did increase (such as where coverage was ex- panded from single to family to add the nondependent child), you can allocate the amount on Form 1040 or 1040- SR to the nondependent child and any excess amounts not attributable to that child would be eligible to be claimed on Schedule A. Example 1. Taxpayer Z is self -employed in 2022 and has self -only coverage for health insurance. Z's premium for that coverage was $5,000 for the year. Z changes to family coverage only to add Z's 26 -year- old nondepend- ent child to the plan. Z's health insurance premium increa- ses to $10,000 for the year. After completing the Self -Em- ployed Health Insurance Deduction Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1040, Z can only deduct $4,000 on Form 1040 or 1040 -SR. The $4,000 is allocable to the nondependent child. Z can only claim the $5,000 alloca- ble to Z's coverage on Schedule A. The $1,000 excess premiums allocable to the nondependent child can't be claimed by Z. Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 , except that Z had family coverage when Z added the 26-year- old nondependent child to the policy. There was no increase in the $10,000 premium. In this case, Z could claim $4,000 on Form 1040 or 1040 -SR and $6,000 on Schedule A. More information. For more information, see Pub. 535.

Reporting and resolving your tax -related identity theft issues. Tax-related identity theft happens when someone steals your personal information to commit tax fraud. Your taxes can be affected if your SSN is used to file a fraudulent return or to claim a refund or credit. The IRS doesn't initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text messages (including shortened links), tele- phone calls, or social media channels to request or verify personal or financial information. This includes requests for personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, or similar information for credit cards, banks, or other financial accounts.Go to IRS.gov/IdentityTheft , the IRS Identity Theft Central webpage, for information on identity theft and data security protection for taxpayers, tax professio- nals, and businesses. If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you're a victim of tax-related identity theft, you can learn what steps you should take. Get an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN). IP PINs are six-digit numbers assigned to taxpayers to help pre- vent the misuse of their SSNs on fraudulent federal in- come tax returns. When you have an IP PIN, it pre- vents someone else from filing a tax return with your SSN. To learn more, go to IRS.gov/IPPIN . Ways to check on the status of your refund. Go to IRS.gov/Refunds . Download the official IRS2Go app to your mobile de- vice to check your refund status. Call the automated refund hotline at 800-829-1954. Note. The IRS can't issue refunds before mid -Febru- ary for returns that claimed the EIC or the additional child tax credit (ACTC). This applies to the entire refund, not just the portion associated with these credits. Making a tax payment. Go to IRS.gov/Payments for in- formation on how to make a payment using any of the fol- lowing options. IRS Direct Pay : Pay your individual tax bill or estima- ted tax payment directly from your checking or sav- ings account at no cost to you. Debit or Credit Card : Choose an approved payment processor to pay online or by phone. Electronic Funds Withdrawal : Schedule a payment when filing your federal taxes using tax return prepara- tion software or through a tax professional. Electronic Federal Tax Payment System : Best option for businesses. Enrollment is required. Check or Money Order : Mail your payment to the ad- dress listed on the notice or instructions. Cash : You may be able to pay your taxes with cash at a participating retail store. Same-Day Wire : You may be able to do same-day wire from your financial institution. Contact your finan- cial institution for availability, cost, and time frames. Note. The IRS uses the latest encryption technology to ensure that the electronic payments you make online, by phone, or from a mobile device using the IRS2Go app are safe and secure. Paying electronically is quick, easy, and faster than mailing in a check or money order. What if I can't pay now? Go to IRS.gov/Payments for more information about your options. Apply for an online payment agreement (IRS.gov/ OPA ) to meet your tax obligation in monthly install- ments if you can't pay your taxes in full today.

Understanding an IRS notice or letter you've re- ceived. Go to IRS.gov/Notices to find additional informa- tion about responding to an IRS notice or letter. You can use Schedule LEP (Form 1040), Request for Change in Language Preference, to state a preference to receive notices, letters, or other written communications from the IRS in an alternative language. You may not im- mediately receive written communications in the reques- ted language.

You will continue to receive communications, including notices and letters, in English until they are translated to your preferred language. Contacting your local IRS office.
