She found a chiropractor specializing in kinesiology and flourished in their care. Various adjustments with proper supplementation and nutrition got her back on track and racing at the collegiate level. Her passion grew deep roots in this experience and propelled her to the Athletic Training program at Kansas Wesleyan University. She attended Logan College of Chiropractic in Missouri and focused on Applied Kinesiology, with an additional 100 hours of acupuncture training, and graduated Cum Laude as a Doctor of Chiropractic in 2014. Crystal specializes in kinesiology, functional medicine integration and nutrition with her chiropractic roots, approaching each patient as a whole body. She treats patients with chronic disorders, gut and autoimmune diseases, food sensitivities, hormonal imbalance and methylation issues, and much more.
