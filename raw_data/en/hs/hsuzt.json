Data synthesis and 2.6.1 Protocol: Existential interventions in adult patients with cancer 2 1. Background During the last decades, a shift has been made in the treatment of cancer patients from focusing on physical symptoms to seeing patients as holistic human beings with physical, psy- choso cial and spiritual needs Piderman et al., 2015) . To b e diagnosed with a life threatening disease such as cancer can be a deeply unsettling exp erience that may raise existential concerns (Lee & Loiselle, 2012) . Patient s may ask themselves ques- tions on why this would happen to them and what sense to make out of it. While some cancer patients experience their illness as an opportunity for personal growth, others might find it hard to find answers to their questions , possibly resulting in decreased psychological and spir- itual well-being (Moreno & Stanton, 2013; Pearce, Coan, Ii, Koenig, & Abernethy, 2011) . Spiritual well -being refers to the construct of spirit uality, which can be defined \"as the way people find meaning and purpose, and how they experience their connectedness to self, others, the significant, or sacred\" (Puchalski, 2012, p. iii49) . Spirituality can be further divided into two subcomponents: a religio us component, referring to one's faith, and an existen tial component, referring to one's sense of meaning in life (Breitbart, 2001; Paloutzian & Ellison, 1982) . Spiritual well -being has been associated with several patient outcomes. A high level of spiritual well -being can help cancer patie nts cope with their illness, enhance qua lity of life and protect against end -of-life despair (Bai & Lazenby, 2015; Lin & Bauer -Wu, 2003; McClain, Rosenfeld, & Breitbart, 2003) . On the other hand, existential distress may lead to a sta te of demoralization, which is characterized by feelings of losing meaning, hope or dignity , by a desire for hastened death and by suicidal ideat ion (Kissane, Clarke, & Street, 2001; Robinson, Kissane, Brooke r, & Burney, 2015) . Additionally, anxiety and depressi on are prevalent in cancer populations and have been negatively associated with spiritual well -being and posi- tively with demoralization (Rabow & Knish, 2014; Robinson et al., 2015) . Therefore, psycho- logical and spiritual well -being seem to be connected and should both be considered by inter- ventions addressing existentia l needs and concerns of cancer patients . Meanwhile, a variety of such interventions has been developed and evaluated, stemming from different conceptual ba- ses like existential psychotherapy or logotherapy (LeMay & Wilson, 2008) . Recently a number of systematic reviews have been conducted to eval uate the effec- tiven ess of spiritual interventions in different populations (Best et al., 2015; Candy et al., 2012; Study Protocol: Existential interventions in adult patients with cancer 3 et al., 2016; Oh & Kim, 2014) . Three of them have provided descriptive evaluation s of spir- itual-religious and life review interventions in terminally ill patients, and of interventions ad- dressing holistic suffering in cancer patients (Best et al., 2015; Candy et al., 2012; Keall et al., 2015) . They all arrived at promising, yet inconclusive results and none of them could state which intervention is suited best for which outcomes and patients. However, they noted that there might be moderating factors like intervention format, therapist, time frame, attrition or screening for baseline distress. Other reviews on spiritual interventions used a meta -analytic approach (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2015; Kruizinga et al., 2016; Oh & Kim, 2014) . Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2015 ) found that religious and spiritual interventions signific antly reduce levels of anxiety across various populations, with only four studies conducted on cancer patients. Oh and Kim (2014) demonstrated significant effects of spiritual interventions on spiritual well -being, meaning of life and depression in cancer patients. But they included only five studies on exis- tential interventions, mainly meaning -centered psychotherapy. So far, only one review fo- cused on existential interventions in cancer patients (Kruizinga et al., 2016) . In this review, existential interventions with a narrative approach were found to significantly increase quality of life in the short term, but not in the long term. Quality of life was the only outcome of this review and also some types of interventions were not included, like supportive -expressive or cognitive -existential therapy . In sum, the impact of existential interventions on spiritual, psy- chological and physical outcomes in cancer patients is still largely unclear. Effects on different relevant outcomes like spiritual well -being, hope or physical well -being as well as detrimental effects have not yet been quantified. Potential moderator s like cancer stage and type or under- lying concepts have been scarcely explored. Questions remain open regarding which types of existential interventions consistently improve which outcomes to what extent in cancer pa- tients and what factors might influence the effectiveness. This review seeks to provide answers to these questions. To the author's knowledge, a comprehensive systematic review and meta - analysis on the effectiveness of existential interventions in cancer patients of all cancer stages, including a wide range of intervention concepts and outcomes, is still missing. The aims of the current systemati c review and meta -analysis therefore will be: 1. To synthesize the evidence and evaluate the effectiveness of existential interven- tions in adult cancer patients in comparison to no treatment, wait -list, active control or attention /psychological placebo. Study Protocol: Existential interventions in adult patients with cancer 4 2. To present pooled estimates of the effects of existential interventions on a wide range of patient outcomes at different time points , including indicators of spiritual, psychological and physical well -being. 3. To identify and explore factors that might moderate the effects of existential inter- ventions and account for heterogeneity . 2. Methods This systematic review and meta -analysis will be registered on Prospero (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ ) and it will be reported in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines (Liberati et al., 2009) . 2.1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria 2.1.1 Population Studies on adult s aged 18 or older of any gender that have been diagnosed with cancer of any type (solid and non -solid tumors) will be included. In case of mixed populations re- garding age or disease, authors wi ll be contacted and asked for separate data, unless at least 90% of the population consists of adults with cancer. From newly diagnosed to terminally ill patients or cancer survivors, all stages of cancer will be included, a s existential distress can occur in any stage (Lee & Loiselle, 2012) . Studies on interventions for children or adol escents with cancer and family members or caregivers of cancer patients will be excluded. Also studies investigating existential concerns in staff treating cancer patients will not be subject of this review. 2.1.2 Intervention s Interventions must be manualiz ed an d address existe ntial needs or concerns as a main component, for example by creating meaning , by enhancing hope or by preparing for death. Interventions may but need not be developed exclusively for terminally ill patients. They can be provided face-to-face by therapists with different professional backgrounds (e.g. physi- cians , psychotherapists, trained nurses ) or without face -to-face contact (e.g. online, via tele- phone) to individuals , dyads or groups . Interventions solely consisting of meditation and mindfulness -based techniques will be excluded as several meta -analyse s have been conducted on this topic (Piet, W\u00fcrtzen, & Zachariae, 2012; J. Zhang, Yang, Tian, & Wang, 2012; M. -F. Study Protocol: Existential interventions in adult patients with cancer 5 Zhang et al., 2015) . Also inte rventions solely consisting of religious rituals (e.g. daily prayer) or non-manualized occasional consultation s of chaplain s will be excluded. Relevant existential interventions will include but not necessarily be limited to : Meaning -centered psychothe rapy Dignity therapy Reminiscence and life review therapy Supportive -expressive group therapy Cognitive -existential therapy Interventions aimed at enhancing hope , forgiveness, etc. 2.1.3 Comparison s Comparison groups m ay include : No treatment (NT; participants rece iving no existential intervention , no active control and no attention/psychological placebo ) Wait -list (WL; participants receiving the existential intervention after a waiting time) Active control (AC; participants receiving pharmacological interventions, e.g. antidepressants, or other established non -existential psychosocial interven- tions, e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy) Attention /psychological placebo (A PP; participants receiving the same amount of time/attention as the treatment group in the form of non-specific support) In case of more than one comparison group in one study , data of the comparison groups will be combined , as recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins & Green, 2008) . 2.1.4 Outcome s Outcomes have to be assessed post-treatment using validated measures of either self - report or observer rating. Where outcome s are assessed both by self -report and observer rating , self-report measures will be preferred , as they describe more adequately the patients' subjec- tive experience . If several outcome measures of the same hierarchy level are used, the measure most frequently used across included studies will be select ed. If there is no predominantly Study Protocol: Existential interventions in adult patients with cancer 6 used measure, the outcome measure will be randomly selected. Outcome data will be pooled at the end of treatment. Follow -up data , if available, will be grouped into short -term (up to 3 months post -treatment), medium -term (3 to 6 months post -treatment) and long-term effects (more than 6 months post -treatment). Primary outcomes of this review will be : Spiritual well -being/ meaning , e.g. using scales like the Functional Assess- ment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Spiritual Well -Being Scale (FACIT -Sp) Depression , e.g. using scales like the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) Anxiety , e.g. using scales like the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Secondary outcomes will be : Existential well -being, e.g. using the meaning subscale of the FACIT -Sp Overall Quali ty of L ife, e.g. using scales like the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -General (FACT -G) Hope/ Hope lessness, e.g. using scales like the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) Self-efficacy, e.g. using scales like the General Self -Efficacy Scale (GSES) Desire for hastened death, e.g. using scales like the Schedule of Attitudes To- ward Hastened Death (SAHD) Severity of physical symptoms, e.g. pain using scales like the Brief Pain inven- tory (BPI) or scales of physical functioning Adverse events (measured as a binary outcome : adverse events yes/no ) 2.1.5 Study design Randomized and non -randomized controlled trials reported in the German and E nglish language will be included. Studies may have been conducted within any setting, such as inpa- tient, outpatient or bedside at the patients' home s. 2.2 Search strategy Electronic databa ses will be searched for studies with no restrictions being applied on publication date or publication statu s. The following data bases will be searched using the search strategy outlined in the app endix : Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CEN-Study Protocol: Existential interventions in adult patients ganization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/) will be searched for ongoing and unpublished trials . Refer- ence lists of all included studies and relevant reviews will be hand -searched and authors of included studies will be contacted and asked for additional studies. 2.3 Study selection Study selection will be conducted independently by two reviewers (NB, S\u00d6). In a first step, all titles and abstracts wil l be screened for potential eligibility by the primary reviewer (NB) , excluding obviously irrelevant studies . In a second step, titles an d abstracts will be screened by both reviewers (NB, S\u00d6) in order to identify relevant studies, considering the aforementioned eligibility criteria. Where titles and abstracts don't provide enough infor- mation to make a decision o n eligibility, full texts will be retrieved and analyzed. Disagree- ments will be resolved by discussion, involving a third reviewer (HB) if necessary. The whole search and selection process will be outlined in a PRISMA flowchart, pre- senting numbers of inclu ded and excluded studies at each step as well as reasons for exclusion . 2.4 Data extraction Two reviewers (NB, S\u00d6) will independently extract data using a standardized form that will be pilot -tested . Disagreements will be resolved by discussion, involving a th ird re- viewer (HB) if necessary. Study authors will be contacted in case of missing data. The follow- ing data will be extracted: Study characteristics: aut hors, title, publication status, publication year , coun- try, study design (RCT/CT) , study arms, study s etting, time points of follow - ups, attrition rates Participant characteristics: sample size, age, gender, ethnicity, type and stage of cancer, type and status of cancer treatment Intervention characteristics: name and short description of the intervention, conceptual framework (e.g. meaning -centered, dignity -based, etc.), duration and number of sessions, mode of delivery (e.g. face-to-face, telephone -based, web-based , etc.; individual, group ), (e.g. physician, psy- chotherapist, trained nurse) Study Protocol: Existential interventions in adult patients with cancer 8 Outcomes: measures and statistical data (means, standard deviations, effect sizes, confidence intervals) of primary and secondary outcomes 2.5 Quality assessment Risk of bias of the i ncluded studies will be evaluated independently by two reviewe rs (NB, S\u00d6) using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias T ool (Higgins et al., 2011) . Judg- ments on \"low\", \"high\" or \"unclear\" risk of bias will be made for each study across the fol- lowing five domains: random sequen ce gene ration, allocation concealment , incomplete out- come data, selective reporting and other sources of bias. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion, involving a third reviewer (HB) if necessary. Publication bias will be analyzed using funne l plots and testing for funnel plot asymmetry, if at least 10 studies can be included. 2.6 Data synthesis and analysis A detailed description of results will be given for all included studies in both text and tables . Meta -analyses will be conducted with the latest R software using ran dom effects mod- els. For continuous data standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated as effect sizes . In case of dichotomous data, effect sizes may include hazard ratios, relative risk s or odds rati os with 95% confidence intervals. Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using the I2 statistic and 2. According to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgin s & Green, 2011 ), heterogeneity can be regarded as not im- portant for an I2 value of 0% to 40%, moderate for an I2 value of 30% to 60%, substantial for an I2 value of 50% to 90% and considerable for an I2 value of 75% to 90%. In this review, heterogeneit y will be regarded as substantial with an I2 > 60%. Potential sources of heteroge- neity will be assessed by subgroup and sensitivit y analyses. 2.6.1 Subgroup analyses Subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution as they are observational in na- ture and may be misleading . The following subgroup analyses are planned to be conducted for the primary outcomes : Cancer stage and type (early stage vs. terminal vs. survivors ; breast vs. other ) Age of participants (younger vs. older patients) Type of intervention (meaning -centered therapy vs. dignity therapy etc.) Intervention format (individual vs. group ; number /length of sessions ; setting ) Study Protocol: Existential interventions in adult patients with cancer 9 Inclusion of religious components (religious components yes vs. no) Therapist's profession (physician vs. psychotherapist vs . trained staff) Screening for b aseline distress ( high vs. low baseline distress ) 2.6.2 Sensitivity analyses Sensitivity analyses will be carried out in order to assess the robustness of findings with regard to study design (excluding non-randomized studies ), risk of bias (excluding stud- ies with a high risk of bias) and publication status (excluding unpublished studies). 3. Discussion This systematic review and meta -analy sis will extend previous research on the effec- tiveness of spiritual interventions in several ways , focusing on existential interventions in can- cer patients . A wide perspective will be applied considering a variety of conceptual bases of existential interventions and a variety of relevant outcomes. In order to account for the multi- ple needs of cancer patients, o utcomes will include indicators of spiritual, psychological and physical well -being. As cancer patients may experience existential distress at any time during and after illness, a ll stages of cancer as well as survivorship will be include d. As a methodo- logical strength t here will be no restriction on publication status in order to better address publication bias. By combining a meta -analytic approach with a wide perspective, this review seeks to clarify open questions regarding the magnitu de and determinants of the beneficial and detrimental effects of existential interventions in cancer patients. Implications for research and clinical practice will be derived. 4. Dissemination The findings of this systematic review and meta -analysis will be summarized within a psychological master thesis at the University of Ulm and might be published in a peer -re- viewed scientific journal.
