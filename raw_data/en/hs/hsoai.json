Cross -Setting Measures Development Work: An Introductio n The Improving Medicare Post -Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (IMPACT Act), enacted October 6, 2014, directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \"specify quality measures on which post -acute care (PAC) providers are required under the appli cable reporting provisions to submit standardized patient assessment data\" in several quality measure domains, including incidence of major falls, skin integrity and changes in skin integrity, medication reconciliation, functional status, transfer of healt h information and care preference s when an individual transitions, and resource use and other measures. The IMPACT Act requires the implementation of quality measures to address these measure domains in inpatient r ehabilitation facilities (IRFs), long -term care hospitals (LTCHs), skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) , and home health agencies (HHAs). The IMPACT Act also requires, to the extent possible, the submission of such quality measure data through the use of a PAC assessment instrument and the modificati on of the instrument as necessary to enable such use. This requirement refers to the collecti on of such data by means of the IRF Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF -PAI) for IRFs, the LTCH Continuity Assessment Record and Evaluation Data Set (LTCH CARE Data Set or LCDS) for LTCHs, the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 for SNFs, and the Outcome and Assessm ent Information Set ( OASIS ) for HHAs. For more information on the statutory history of the IRF, LTCH, or SNF Q uality Reporting Program (QRP), please refer to the Fiscal Year ( FY) 201 6 final rules, and for the HH QRP, please refer to the C alendar Y ear (CY) 2016 final rule. More information on the IMPACT Act is available at https://www.govtrack.us/congre ss/bills/113/hr4994 . In this document, we present specifications for the standardized patient assessment data elements (SPADEs) and two measures finalized for adoption for the SNF QRP through the FY 2020 SNF Prospective Payment System (PPS) final rule. The Transfer of Health Information measure concept consists of two companion measures: 1. Transfer of Health Information to the Provider -Post -Acute Care Measure 2. Transfer of Health Information to the Patient -Post -Acute Care Measure We also provide updated specifications for the previously adopted Discharge to Community measure. 2 Section 2. Cross- Setting Measure: Transfer of Health Information to the Provider- Post- Acute Care Measure Measure Description This measure, the Transfer of Health Information to the P rovider, assesses for and reports on the timely transfer of health information, specifically transfer of a reconciled medication list. This measure evaluates for the transfer of information when a patient /resident is transferred or discharged from their current setting to a subsequent provider. For this measure, the subsequent provider is defined as a short - term general hospital, a SNF, intermediate care, home under care of an organized home health service organization or hospice, hospice in an institutional facility, an IRF, an LTCH, a Medicaid nursing facility, an inpatient psychiatric facility, or a critical access hospital. This measure, developed under the IMPACT Act, has been developed concept ually for the IRF, LTCH, SNF, and HHA settings. This measure is calculated by one standard ized data element that asks, \"at the time of discharge, did the facility provide the patient's /resident's current reconciled medication list to the subsequent provider ?\" It also includes one data element that asks the route o f transmission of the reconciled medication list (Appendix A). In order to track discharge to a subsequent provider, the MDS 3.0 will be used to track discharge location status. Guidance for what i s considered a reconciled medication list is discussed in g reater detail in the section below. The measure is conceptualized uniformly across the PAC settings. The measure is calculated using data from the IRF -PAI for IRF patients, the LCDS for LTCH patients, the MDS 3.0 assessment instrument for SNF residents, an d the OASIS for HHA patients. Data are collected and calculated separately in each of the four settings using standardized data elements. The collection of this measure and the components tied to t he standardized data element used to calculate this measure are described in Appendix A. The Reconciled Medication List The Transfer of Health Information measures serve as a check to ensure that a reconciled medication list is provided as the patient cha nges care settings at discharge . Defining the completeness of that medication list is left to the discretion of the providers and patient who are coordinating this care. An example of items that could be on a reconciled medication list can be but are not limited to a list of the current prescribed and over -the-counter medications, nutritional supplements, vitamins, and/or homeopathic and herbal products administered by any route at the time of discharge or transfer. A reconciled medication could also include important information about: ( 1) the patient/resident , including their name, date of birth, active diagnoses, known medication and other allergies, and known drug sensitivities and reactions ; and (2) each medication, including the name, strength , dose, route of medication administration, frequency or timing , purpose/indication, and/or any special instructions. However, this information serves as guidance and as stated prior, the completeness of the medication list is left to the discret ion of the providers and patient. Documentation sources for reconciled med ication list information include electronic and/or paper records. Some examples of such records are discharge summary records, a Medication Administration Record, an Intravenous Medication Administration Record, a home medication list, and physician orders. The guidance on what to include in a reconciled medication list is aligned to the provisions in the proposed Discharge Planning for Hospitals, Critical Access Hospital, and H HAs regulation, which outlines discharge planning and the documentation of medi cations (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/11/03/2015-27840/medicare-and- medicaid -programs- revisions -to-requirements-for- discharge-planning-for-hospitals ). In addition, this guidance follows the requirements finalized in the Reform of Requirements for Long- Term Care Facilities (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/10/04/2016-23503/medicare-and- medicaid -programs- reform -of-requirements-for-long- term-care-facilities ). 3 Purpose/Rationale for the Quality Measure In 2013, 22.3 percent of all acute hospital discharges were discharged to PAC settings, including 11 percent who were discharged to home under the care of a home health agency (HHA) , and 9 percent who we re discharged to SNFs.1 The proportion of patients being discharged from an acute care hospital to a PAC setting was greater among beneficiaries enrolled in fee-for- service (FFS) Medicare. Among FFS patients discharged from an acute hospital, 42 percent we nt directly to PAC settings. Of those, 20 percent were discharged to a SNF, 18 percent were discharged to an HHA, 3 percent were discharged to an IRF, and 1 percent were discharged to an LTCH.2 Of the Medicare FFS beneficiaries with a SNF stay in FY 2017, an estimated 21 percent were discharged or transferred to an acute care hospital, 11 percent were discharged home with home health services, and 2 percent were discharged or transferred to another PAC setting (for example, an IRF, a hospice, or another SNF ).3 The transfer and/or exchange of health information from one provider to another takes several forms , including verbal (e.g., clinician -to-clinician communication by telephone or in- person), paper - based (e.g. , faxed or printed copies of re cords) , and el ectronic communication (e.g., via health information exchange network, using an electronic health/medical record, secure messaging). Health information, such as medication information, that is incomplete or missing increases the likelihood of a patient/res ident safety risk, often life -threatening.4 Poor communication and coordination across health care settings contributes to patient complications, hospital readmissions, emergency department visits, and medication errors.5 Communication has be en cited as th e third -most -frequent root cause in sentinel 1 Tian, W.

However, there is limited information about the route or mode (for example, paper -based, verbal, and electronic) of transmission used by PAC providers to transfer health information. PAC provider health information exchange support s the goals of high -quality, personalized, and efficient health care; care coordination and person- centered care; and real- time, data -driven clinical decision making. PAC patients often have complicated medication regimens and require efficient and effecti ve communication and coordination of care between settings, including transfer of detailed medication information.9 Individuals in PAC settings may be vulnerable to adverse health outcomes because of insufficient medication information on the part of their health care p roviders, and their higher likelihood for multiple comorbid chronic conditions, polypharmacy, and complicated transitions between care Forster, A.

High prevalence of medication discrepancies between home health referrals and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services home health certification and plan of care and their potential to affect safety of vulnerable elderly adults. Journal of the A merican drug events (ADEs) occur after hospital discharge in a variety of settings , including PAC.11 Patients in PAC settings are often taking multiple medications. Consequently, PAC providers regularly are in the position of starting complex new medication regimens with little knowledge of the patient or their medication histor y upon admission. Furthermore, inter- facility communication barriers delay resolving medication discrepancies during transitions of care.12 The transfer of a medication list between providers is necessary for medication reconciliation interventions, which have been shown to be a cost -effective way to avoid ADEs by reducing errors,13 especially when medications are reviewed by a pharmacist and when it is done in conjunction with the use of electronic medical records.14 Denominator The denominator is the number of SNF Medicare Part A covered resident stays ending in discharge to a short -term general hospital, another SNF, intermediate care, home under care of an organized home health service organization or hospice, hospice in an institutional facility, a swing bed, an IRF, an LTCH, a Medicaid nursing facility, an inpatient psychiatric facility, or a critical access hospital. Discharge to one of these providers is based on response to the discharge location item, A2105, of the MDS assessment, shown below. A stay is defined as the time from resident admission or reentry to the facility (identified by a 5 -day PPS assessment) to Part A PPS discharge. 10 Chhabra, P. T., Rattinger, G. B., Dutcher, S.

Not Listed Numerator The numerator is the number of stays for which the MDS 3.0 indicated that the following is true: At the time of discharge, the facility provided a curre nt reconciled medication list to the subsequent provider (A2121= [1]). Measure Time Window The measure will be calculated quarterly. All SNF stays during the quarter will be included in the denominator and are eligible for inclusion in the numerator. For residents with multiple stays during the quarter, each stay is eligible for inclusion in the measure. Items Included in the Quality Measure One data element will be included to calculate the measure. One data element will be collected to inform internal measure consistency logic.

Quality Measure Calculation Steps The following steps are used to calculate the measure: Step 1. Calculate the denominator count Calculate the total number of patient stays with discharge to a subsequent provider based on discharge location item A2105. Step 2. Calculate the numerator count Calculate the total number of stays where a reconciled medication list was transferred: A2121= [1] Step 3 . Calculate the facility observed score Divide the facility's numerator count by its denominator count; in other words, divide the results of Step 2 by the results of Step 1. Multiply by 100. Quality Measure Coding Steps The following steps are used to code the measure: 1.At discharge, code for the patient's discharge location. Identify discharge location with item A2105. 2.At discharge, code for whether the facility provided the reconciled medication list to th e s ubsequent provider. A valid res ponse for item A2105 would trigger the coder to complete item A 2121.8 3. At discharge, code for the route of transmission. A valid response for item A2121 [A2121= 1] would s end the coder to it em A2122. This item i s us ed for internal measure consistency logic.9 Section 3. Cross- Setting Measure: Transfer of Health Information to the Patient -Post- Acute Care Measure Measure Description This measure, the Transfer of Health Information to the Patient, assesses for and reports on the timely transfer of health information, specifically transfer of a medication list. This measure evaluates for the transfer of information when a patient/resident is discharged from their current setting of PAC to a private home/apartment, board and care home, assisted living, group home, transitional living, or home under the care of an organized home health service organization or hospice. This measure, developed un der the IMPACT Act, ha s been developed conceptually for the IRF, LTCH, SNF, and HHA settings. This measure is calculated by one standard ized data element that asks, \"at the time of discharge, did the facility provide the patient's/resident's current reconc iled medication list to the patient /resident, family, and/or caregiver?\" It also includes one data element that asks the route of transmission of the reconciled medication list (Appendix A). In order to track discharge to home, the MDS will be used to t rack discharge location status. The measure is conceptualized uniformly across the PAC settings. The measure is calculated using data from the IRF -PAI for IRF patients, the LCDS for LTCH patients, the MDS 3.0 assessment instrument for SNF residents, and the O ASIS for HHA patients. Data are collected and calculated separately in each of the four settings using standardized data elements. The collection of this measure and the components tied to the standardized data element used to calculate this measure are in Appendix A. The Reco nciled Medication List Discussion related to what is a reconciled medication list is located in Chapter 1, Section 2. The Transfer of Health Information measures serve as a check to ensure that a reconciled medication list is provided as the patient chang es care settings at discharge . Defining the completeness of that medication list is left to the discretion of the providers and patient who are coordinating this care. Purpose/Rationale for the Quality Measure In 2013, 22.3 percent of all acute hospital discharges were discharged to PAC settings, including 11 percent who were discharged to home under the care of an HHA.15 Of the Medicare FFS beneficiaries with a SNF stay in FY 2017, an estimated 11 percent were discharged home with home health services, 41 percent were discharged home with self- care, and 0.2 percent were discharged with home hospice services.16 The communication of health information, such as a reconciled medication list, is critical to ensuring safe and effective patient transitions from health care settings to home and other community settings. Incomplete or missing health information, such as medication information, increases the likelihood of a patient safety risk, often life- threatening.17 Individuals who use PAC settings are particularly vulnerable to adverse health outcomes because of their higher likelihood of multiple comorbid chronic conditions, polypharmacy, and complicated transitions between care settings.18 Upon discharge to home, individuals in PAC settings may be faced with numerous medication changes, new 15 Tian, 2016. 16 RTI International analysis of Medicare claims data for index stays in IRF 2016/2017.

Chhabra et al. , 2012. 10 medication regimes, and follow-up details.19 The efficient and effective communication and coordination of medication information may be critical to prevent potentially deadly adverse effects. When care coordination activities enh ance care transitions, these activities can reduce duplication of care services and costs of care, resolve conflicting care plans, and prevent medical errors.20 The transfer of a patient's medication information to the patient, family, or caregiver is comm on practice and supported by discharge planning requirements for participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs.21 However, there is limited information about the route or mode (for example, paper-based, verbal, and electronic) of transmission used by PAC providers to transfer health information. PAC provider health information exchange with patients, families, and caregivers supports the goals of high - quality, personalized, and efficient health care; care coordination and per son-centered care; and real- time, data- driven clinical decision making. Most PAC electronic health record systems generate a discharge medication list. I n terventions to promote patient participation in medication management have been shown to be acceptable and potentially useful for imp roving patient outcomes and reducing costs.22 Furthermore, provision of a reconciled medication list to patients/residents and their caregivers can improve transitional care.23 Some clinical practice guidelines state the importance of medication safety and communicating accurate medication information to the patient. For example, The Joint Commission's National Patient Safety Goals #4 and #5 for Home Care Accreditation (NPSG.03.06.01) are as follows:24 4. Provide the pat ient (or family as needed) with written i nformation on the medications the patient should be taking when leaving the organization's care (for example, name, dose, route, frequency , pur pose) . 5.E xplain the importance of managing medication information to the patient.

A valid response for item A2123 [A212 3=1] would s end the coder to item A2124. This item is used for internal measure consistency logic. 14 Section 4. Update to the Discharge to Community-Post Acute Care (PAC) Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Quality Reporting Program (QRP) Measure Measure Up date The Discharge to Community-Post Acute Care (PAC Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Quality Reporting Program (QRP) measure was adopted for the SNF QRP in the FY 2017 SNF Prospective Payment final rule (81 FR 52021 through 52029 ) to meet the requirement of the IMPACT Act. Measure specifications were first published in July 2016.26 These draft specifications include a new measure exclusion for baseline nursing facility ( NF) residents; there are no other changes to measure specifications. Measure Description This measure assesses successful discharge to the community from a PAC setting, with successful discharge to the community including no unplanned rehospitalizations and no death in the 31 days following discharge. Specifically, this measure reports a SNF's risk-standardized rate of Medicare fee- for-servi ce (FFS) residents who are discharged to the community after a SNF stay, do not have an unplanned readmission to an acute care hospital or LTCH in the 31 days following discharge to community, and remain alive during those 31 days. Community, for this meas ure, is defined as home/self - care, with or without home health services, based on Patient Discharge Status Codes 01, 06, 81, and 86 on the Medicare FFS claim.27,28 We adopted four discharge to co mmunity measures for IRF, LTCH, SNF, and home health ( HH) settings, respectively. These measures are conceptualized uniformly across the PAC settings in terms of the definition of the discharge to community outcome, the approach to risk adjustment, and the measure calculation, with some differences where needed due t o setting -specific considerations. It is important to note that each measure is specific to the particular PAC setting (i.e., IRF, LTCH, SNF, or HH); we do not pool PAC patients/residents across settings in the measure development and calculation. Purpose/Rationale for the Measure Discharge to a community setting is an important health care outcome for many patients/residents for whom the overall goals of PAC include optimizing functional improvement, returning to a previous level of independence, and avoiding institutionalization. Returning to the community is also an important outcome for many patients/residents who are not expected to make functional improvement during their PAC stay, and for patients/residents who may be expected to decline functionally because of their medical condition. By assessing whether patients remain alive in the community without acute complications for 31 days following discharge, the Discharge to Community -PAC SNF Q RP measure is a meaningful patient - and family- centered measure of successful community discharge. In addition to being an important outcome from a patient/resident and family perspective, patients/residents discharged to community settings, on average, in cur lower costs over the recovery 26 The original measure specifications are available at Billing Committee Official UB -04 Data Specif ications Manual 2018 (Version 12). Chicago, IL: Author. 28 Patient disch arge status codes 81 and 86 are intended for use on acute care claims only. However, because these codes have sometimes been reported on PAC claims, we include them in our definition of community to credit the PAC provider for discharging the patient to a community setting. This definition is not intended to suggest that group homes, foster care, or other residential care settings included in the definition of \"community\" for the purpose of this measure are the most integrated setting for any particular individual or group of individuals under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504. 15 episode, compared with those discharged to institutional settings.29 Given the high costs of care in institutional settings, encouraging PACs to prepare patients for discharge to community, when clinically appropriate, may have cost -saving implications for the Medicare program.30 Also, providers have found that successful discharge to community was a major driver of their ability to achieve savings, where capitated payments for PAC were in place. 31 For patients/residents who r equire long -term care due to persistent disability, disc harge to community could result in lower long- term care costs for Medicaid and for patients'/residents' out -of-pocket expenditures.32 Analyses conducted by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) using 2013 PAC data demonstrate the substantially higher costs of institutional PAC stays compared with HH stays.33 Average costs of HH stays ranged from $1,790 to $2,699 depending on the position of the HH stay in a sequence of PAC care. Average cost s of institutional PAC stays (including IRF, LTCH, and S NF stays) ranged from $13,948 to $17,506, depending on the position of the institutional PAC stay in a sequence of PAC care. 34 Analyses conducted for the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) on PAC episodes, using a 5 percent sample of 2006 Medicare claims, revealed that relatively high average, unadjusted Medicare payments are associated with discharge to institutional settings from IRFs, SNFs, LTCHs , or HHAs, as compared with payments associated with discharge to community settings.35 Aver age, unadjusted Medicare payments associated with discharge to community settings ranged from $0 to $4,017 for IRF discharges, $0 discharges, and $0 to $992 for HHA discharges. In contrast, payments associated with discharge to non- community settings were considerably higher, ranging from $11,847 to $25,364 for IRF discharges, $9,305 discharges, $35,192 for HHA discharges. 36 These expe nditure estimates only include Medicare expenditures related to the immediate discharge destination following SNF, LTCH, IRF or HH care, and not expenditures related to any subsequent discharge destin ations. Measuring and comparing facility -level discharge- to-community rates is expected to help differentiate among facilities with varying performance in this important domain and to help avoid disparities in care across patient/resident groups. Variation in discharge -to-community rates has been reported withi n and across post -acute settings; across a variety of facility -level characteristics, such as geographic location (for example, region, urban or rural location), ownership (for example, for-profit or nonprofit), and freestanding or hospital -based units; and across patient -level characteristics, such as race 29 Dobrez, D., Heinemann, A.

This estimate includes risk adjustment for resident character istics with the facility ef fect removed. The \"expected\" number of discharges to community is the predicted number of risk-adjusted discharges to community if the same residents were treated at the average facility appropriate to the measure. The regressio n model used to calculate the denominator is developed using all non-excluded facility stays in the national data. The denominator is computed in the same way as the numerator, but the facility effect is set at the average. The descriptions of the discharg e to community outcome, res ident stays included in the measure, and numerator calculation are below. Numerator The measure does not have a simple form for the numerator and denominator \u2014that is, the risk adjustment method does not make the observed number of community discharges the numerator, and a predicted number the denominator. The measure numerator is the risk-adjusted estimate of the number of residents who are discharged to the community, do not have an unplanned readmission to an acute care hospital or LTCH in the 31-day post-discharge observation window, and remain alive during the post- discharge observation window. This estimate starts with the observed discharges to community and is risk-adjusted for resident characteristics and a statistical esti mate of the facility effect beyond case mix. The numerator uses a model estimated on full national data specific to the SNF setting; it is applied to the facility's resident stays included in the measure and includes the estimated effect of that facility. The prediction equation is based on a logistic statistical model with a two -level hierarchical structure. The resident stays in the model have an indicator of the facility they are discharged from; the effect of the facility is measured as a positive or n egative shift in the interc ept term of the equation. The facility effects are modeled as belonging to a normal (Gaussian) distribution centered at 0 and are estimated along with the effects of resident characteristics in the model. Numerator details are pr ovided below. Numerator details: discharge to community Discharge to community is based on the Patient Discharge Status Code from the SNF claim. Discharge to community is defined as discharge to home/self- care with or without home health services. 47 Table 1 lists the Patient Discharg e Status Codes used to define community. Table 1 Patient Discharge Status Codes Used to Determine Discharge to a Community Setting Discharge Status Codes Indicating Discharge to a Community Setting 01 Discharged to home/self -care (routine discharge) 06 Discharged/transferred to home under care of organized home health service organization 81 Discharged to home or self -care with a planned acute care hospital readmission 86 Discharged/transferred to home under care of organized home health service organization with a planned acute care hospital inpatient readmission 47 Amer ican Hospital Association , 2017. 19 Patient discharge status codes 81 and 86 are intended for use on acute care claims only. However, because these codes have sometimes been reported on PAC claims, we incl ude them in our definition of community to credit the PAC provider for discharging the patient to a community setting. Numerator details: unplanned readmissions in the 31-day post-discharge observation window A resident who is discharged to the comm unity is not considered to have a successful discharge to community outcome for this measure if they have a subsequent unplanned readmission to an acute care hospital or LTCH in the post-discharge observation window, which includes the day of discharge and the 31 days following day of discharge. We only assess the first readmission encountered in the post - discharge window. Our definition of acute care hospital includes hospitals paid under the Inpatient PPS (IPPS), critical access hospitals (CAH), and psych iatric hospitals or units. Using acute care and LTCH claims, we identify unplanned readmissions based on the CMS planned readmissions algorithm 48 used in the following PAC readmission measures, endorsed by the National Quality Forum ( NQF) and used in several CMS programs : (1) NQF #2510: Skilled Nursing Facility 30 -Day All ( 2) NQF #2502: All -Cause Readmission Measure 30 Days Discharge from Inpatient Rehabilitation ( 3) NQF #2512: All -Cause U nplanned Readmission Measure for 30 Days Post Discharge from Long -Term Care Hospitals; and ( 4) NQF #2380: Rehospitalization During the First 30 Days of Home Health.49 These readmission measures are based on the Hospital- -Cause Readmission Measure (H WR) (CMS/Yale) for the IRF, and LTCH setting measures.51 The CMS planned readmission definition is based on the claim from the readmission having a code for a diagnosis or procedure that is considered planned; how ever, if a planned procedure is accompanied by a principal diagnosis in a specified list of acute diagnoses, the readmission is reclassified as unplanned. Readmissions to psychiatric hospitals or units are classified as planned readmissions. We use the most cu rrent available version of the CMS planned readmission algorithm from the HWR measure specifications for measure calculation and make necessary updates to the additions made for PAC settings to ensure the algorithm corresponds to our measurement period . This measure was developed with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification ( ICD-9-CM) procedure and diagnosis codes, and it has been transitioned using the ICD-9-CM to ICD -10-CM crosswalk. Numerator details: death in the 31-day post- discharge observation window Residents who are discharged to the community are not considered to have a successful discharge to community outcome for this measure if they die in the post-discharge window, which includes the day 48 Yale New Haven Health Services Corporation - Center for Outcomes Research & Evaluation (YNHHSC/CORE).

Death in the post-discharge window is identified using date of death from Medicare eligibility files. Target Population and Measure Exclusions The target population for the measure is the group of Medi care FFS residents who are not excluded for the reasons listed below. Measure exclusions Exclusions for the discharge to community measure are listed below, along with the rationale and data source for each exclusion. Baseline long- term nursing facility residence is b ased on data from the Minimum Data Set (MDS). All other measure exclusion criteria are determined by processing Medicare claims and eligibility data to determine whether the individual exclusion criteria are met. Only SNF stays that are preced ed by a short- term acute care stay in the 30 days before the SNF admission date are included in the measure. Stays ending in transfers to the same level of care are excluded. 1) Age under 18 years Rationale: a. There is limited literature on discharge destinatio n outcomes in this age group . b. Residents in this age group represent a different cohort, likely living with their parents, and may be expected to have higher discharge- to-community rates than the rest of the Medicare population. c. Residents in this age group represent a small proportion of the post- acute Medicare FFS population. Data source: Birth date and SNF admission date from the Medicare Provider and Analysis Review (MedPAR ) File. 2) No short- term acute care stay within the 30 days preceding SNF admission Rationale: Acute care claims from the 30 days before SNF admission provide the principal diagnosis and other important resident data for risk adjustment. Residents without a short- term acute care discharge withi n the 30 days before PAC admission are excluded from the m easure, because important risk adjustment data are missing. Data source : Hospital discharge date in MedPAR acute care claims in the 30 days before SNF admission . 3) Discharges to psychiatric hospital Rationale: Residents discharged to psychiatric hospital are excluded from the measure because community living at the time of discharge may be potentially inappropriate or unsafe for them because of their mental health or psychiatric condition. Data source : Patient discharge status code from MedPAR SNF claim . 4) Discharges against medical advice Rationale: Residents who discharge themselves against medical advice are excluded because their care plan may not have been fully implemented, and the discharge destination may not reflect the facility's discharge recommendat ion. Additionally, residents discharged against medical advice may 21 be at higher risk of post-discharge readmissions or death, depending on their medical condition or because of potential nonadherenc e or noncompliance with care recommendations. Data source : Patient discharge status code from MedPAR SNF claim . 5) Discharges to disaster alternative care sites or federal hospitals Rationale: Residents discharged to disaster alternative care sites are excluded because these discharges are likely influenced by external emergency conditions and may not represent discretionary discharges by the SNF provider. Discharges to federal hospitals are also excluded . Data source : Patient discharge status code from MedPAR SNF claim . 6) Discharges to court/law enforcement Rationale : Residents who are discharged to court or law enforcement are likely ineligible for discharge to the community because of legal restrictions. Data source : Patient discharge status code from MedPAR SNF claim . 7) Residents discharged to hospice or those with a hospice ben efit in the 31 -day post -discharge window Rationale: a. Residents discharged to hospice care and those with a hospice benefit in the post- discharge observation window are terminally ill and have very different goals of care than non-hospice residen ts. For non -hospice residents, the primary goal of PAC is to return to baseline, independent living in the community; death is an undesirable outcome in the non-hospice population. For residents on hospice, the goal is to give them the opportunity to die comfortably, at home or in a facility. b. A large proportion of residents on hospice care die in the 31 -day window following discharge from the post- acute setting. c. The hospice agency, not the PAC setting , makes the final decision of discharge to hospice-home or hospice- facility. Data source : Discharge to hospice is based on the MedPAR SNF claim . Post-discharge hospice benefit is based on hospice enrollment dates (start and termination dates) in the Enrollment Database (EDB). 8) Residents not continuously enrol led in Part A FFS Medicare for the 12 months before SNF admission date, and at least 31 days after SNF discharge date Rationale: Residents not continuously enrolled in Part A FFS Medicare for the 12 months before the SNF admission date are excluded because risk adjustment for certain comorbidities requires information on acute inpatient bills for one year before SNF admission. Residents not continuously enrolled in Part A FFS Medicare for at least 31 days after SNF discharge are excluded because readmission s and death must be observable in the 31-day post-discharge period. Residents without Part A coverage or those who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans will not have complete inpatient claims in the system. Data source : EDB and Denominator Files. 22 9) Resid ents whose prior short -term acute care stay was for non -surgical treatment of cancer Rationale: Residents whose prior short -term acute care stay was for non -surgical treatment of cancer are excluded because they have a different trajectory for recovery af ter discharge, with a high mortality rate.52 Exclusion of these residents is consistent with the HWR and PAC readmission measures. Data source : Diagnosis codes from the MedPAR SNF claim . 10) SNF stays that end in transfer to the same level of care Rationale : SNF stays that end in transfer to the same level of care are excluded because their SNF episode has not ended. For a SNF episode that involves transfer to the same level of care, only the final SNF provider is included in the measure. Data source : Patient d ischarge status code from MedPAR SNF claim . 11) SNF stays with claims data that are problematic (e.g., anomalous records for stays that overlap wholly or in part, or are otherwise erroneous or contradictory; stays not matched to the denominator or EDB files ; claims not paid) Rationale : This measure requires accurate information from the SNF stay and prior short- term acute care stay in the elements used for risk adjustment. No -pay SNF stays involving exhaustion of Part A benefits are also excluded. Data source: MedPAR claims, EDB and denominator files. 12) Planned discharges to an acute or LTCH setting Rationale : Planned discharges to an acute care hospital or LTCH are excluded because these patients had a planned return to higher level of care, and discharge to co mmunity is not appropriate for these patients. Data source : The planned readmission algorithm is applied to diagnosis and procedure codes found on the first acute care or LTCH claim, if any, on the day of or day after index SNF discharge. 13) Medicare Part A benefits exhausted Rationale : Residents who have exhausted their Medicare Part A coverage during the SNF stay are excluded because the discharge destination decision may be related to exhaustion of benefits. Data source : MedPAR SNF claim . 14) Residents who re ceived care from a facility located outside of the United States, Puerto Rico , or a U.S. territory Ration ale: Residents who received care from foreign facilities may not have complete inpatient claims in the system, and these facilities may not be subject to policy decisions related to this quality measure. Data source : CMS Certification Number from the MedPA R SNF claim . Measure (HWR) (CMS/Yale). www.qualityforum.org/QPS/1789 23 15) Swing Bed Stays in Critical Access Hospitals Rationale : Critical access hospital (CAH) swing bed stays are excluded because CAH swing bed facilities are not required to submit quality data under the SNF QRP and are exempt from the SNF PPS. Note that non- CAH swing bed stays are included in the measure, because n on-CAH swing bed facilities are required to submit quality data under the SNF QRP and are subject to the SNF PPS. Data source : CMS Certification Number from the MedPAR SNF claim. 16) New exclusion: Residents who had a long- term NF stay in the 180 days precedi ng their hospitalization and SNF stay, with no intervening community discharge between the long- term NF stay and qualifying hospitalization for measure inclusion (i.e., baseline NF residents) Rationale : Baseline long- term NF residents did not live in the community before their SNF stay, and discharge to a community setting may not be a safe or expected outcome for these residents. Data source : We examine historical MDS data in the 180 days preceding the qualifying prior acute care admission and index SNF stay. Presence of an Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ( OBRA)- only assessment (a n on SNF PPS assessment) with no intervening community discharge between the OBRA assessment and acute care admission date flags the index SNF stay as a baseline long- term NF resident. Data Sources This measure is based on Medicare FFS administrative c laims and uses data in the Medicare eligibility files, inpatient claims, and MDS. The eligibility files provide information such as date of birth, date of death, sex, reasons for Medicare eligibility, periods of Part A coverage, and periods in the Medicare FFS program. The data elements from the Medicare FFS claims are those basic to the operation of the Medicare payment systems and include data such as date of admission, date of discharge, diagnoses, procedures, indicators for use of dialysis services, and indicators of whether the Part A benefit was exhausted. The inpatient claims data files contain resident -level PAC and other hospital records. Historical MDS data are used to identify baseline NF residents. No data beyond those submitted in the normal course of business are required from SNF providers for the calculation of this measure. The following are the specific files used for measure calculation with links to their documentation: Medicare Inpatient Claims (MedPAR Research Identifiable File [RIF]), Index SNF Claims: Documentation for the Medicare claims data is provided online by Research Data Assistance Center. The following web page includes data dictionaries for the MedPA R RIF: https://www.resd ac.org/cms- data/files/medpar Medicare Enrollment Database: the EDB may be found at http://a spe.hhs.gov/datacncl/datadir/cms.htm Medicare Denominator F ile: Information and doc umentation available at at https://www.resdac.org/cms -data/files/mds -3.0 Measure Time Window The measure is calculated using two years of data. All SNF stays during the two- year time window, except those that meet the exclusion criteria, are included in the measure. For residents with 24 multiple stays during the two- year time window, each stay is eligible for inclusion in the measure. Data from calendar y ear (CY) 2012-2013 were used to develop this measure. The analyses in this document are based on CY 2015-2016 data. Statistical Risk Model and Risk Adjustment Covariates We used a hierarchical logistic regression method to predict the probability of discharge to community. Resident characteristics related to discharge and a marker for the specific discharging facility are included in the equation. The equation is hierarchi cal in that both individual resident characteristics are accounted for, as well as the cluster ing of resident characteristics by facility. The statistical model estimates both the average predictive effect of the resident characteristics across all facilities, and the degree to which each facility has an effect on discharge to community that differs from that of the average facility. The facility effects are assumed to be randomly distributed around the average (according to a normal distribution). When computing the facility effect, hierarchical modeling accounts for the known predictors of discharge to community, on average, such as resident characteristics, the observed facility rate, and the number of facility stays eligible for inclusion in the measure. The estimated facility effect is determined mostly by the facility's own data if the number of resident discharges is relatively large (as the estimate would be relatively precise) , but is adjusted toward the average if the number of resident discharges is small (as that would yield a less- precise estimate). We used the following model: Let Y ij, denote the outcome (equal to 1 if resident i is discharged to community , 0 otherwise ) for a resident i at facility j; Zij denot es a set of risk adjustment variables. We assume the outcome is related to the risk adjusters via a logit function with dispersio j ; j ~ N(0, 2) where Z ij=(Z 1, Z2, ... Z k) is a set of k resident -level risk adjustment variables; j represents the facility -specific intercept; \u00b5 is the adjusted average outcome across all facilities; 2 is the between -facility variance component; and ~N(0,2) is the error term. The hierarchical logistic regression model is estimated using SAS software (PROC GLIMMIX: SAS/STAT User's Guide, SAS Institute Inc.). The estimated eq uation is used twice in the measure. The sum of the probabilities of discharge to community of all residents in the facility measure, including both the effects of resident characteristics and the facility, is the \"predicted number\" of discharges to commun ity after adjusting for the facility's case mix. The same equation is used without the facility effect to compute the expected number of discharges to community for the same residents at the average facility. The ratio of the predicted to expected number of discharges to community is a measure of the degree to which discharges to community are higher or lower than what would otherwise be expected. This standardized risk ratio (SRR) is then multiplied by the mean discharge- to-community rate for all facility stays for the measure, yielding the risk -standardized discharge- to-community rate for each facility. Please note that the estimation procedure is recalculated for each measurement period. Re- estimating the models for each measurement period allows the estimated effects of the resident characteristics to vary over time as resident case mix and medical treatment patterns change. Risk adjustment variable descriptions are below. See Appendix B, Table B-1, for the full list of variables in the risk adjustment m odels. 1. Age and sex groups. 2. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) or disability as original reason for entitlement. 3. Principal diagnosis (Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) groups) from the prior acute stay in the past 30 days. The principal diagnosis codes from the prior acute claim are grouped clin ically 25 using the CCS groupings developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).53 4.Surgical procedure categories (if present) based on the prior acute stay in the past 30 days.

Length of prior acute hospital stay in days for residents whose prior acute stay was in a non - psychiatric hospital (categorical variables are used to a ccount for nonlinearity); indicator of prior psychiatric hospital stay for residents whose prior acute stay was in a psychiatric hospital. 8.Ventilator use during the SNF stay. 9. Comorbidities based on prior acute stay in the past 30 days or based on a one- year look-back, depending on the specific comorbidity. Comorbidities are clustered using the Hierarchical Condition Categories ( HCC ) groups used by CMS.55 10.Nu mber of prior acute hospital discharges in the past year, not including the hospitalization in the 30 days before the SNF stay. Measure Calculation Algorithm The following steps describe the calculation algorithm/measure logic for the discharge- to- commu nity measures: Step 1: Identify residents meeting the criteri a for the target population, after applying measure exclusions. Step 2: Identify residents meeting the numerator criteria (i.e., discharge to community, no unplanned readmissions on the day of discharge or in the 31 days following discharge, and no death on the day of discharge or in the 31 days following discharge). Step 3: Identify presence or absence of risk adjustment variables for each resident . Step 4: Calculate the predicted and expect ed number of discharges to community for each facility using th e hierarchical logistic regression model. The predicted number of discharges to community for each facility is calculated as the sum of the predicted probability of discharge to community for each resident discharged from the facility and included in the m easure, including the facility -specific ef fect. 53 Document ation of the AHRQ Clinical Classifications Software groupings of ICD -9 codes is available at http://www.hcup - us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccs/ccs.jsp . Documentation of the AHRQ Clinical Classifications Software groupings of ICD -10 codes is available at https://www.hcup - us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccs10/ccs10.jsp Ibid. 55 CMS-HCC Mappings of ICD-9 and ICD-1 0 Codes are included in the software at the following website: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-P lans/MedicareAdvtg SpecRateStats/Risk-A djustors.html. 26 To calculate the predicted number of discharges to community, pred j, for index facility stays at facility j, we used the following equation: pred j=logit-1(\u00b5 + i + *Zij) (2) where the sum is over all stays in facility j, and i is the random intercept. To calculate the expected number , exp j, we used the following equation: exp (\u00b5 + *Zij) (3) Step 5: Calculate the SRR for each facility as the ratio of the predicted to expected number of discharges to community. To calculate the facility -wide SRR, SRR j, we used the following equation: SRR (4) Step 6: Calculate the risk -standardized disch arge-to-community rate for each facility. To aid interpretation, the facility -wide SRR j, obtained from equation (4) , is then multiplied by the overall national raw discharge -to-community rate for all facility stays, , to produce the facility -wide risk -standardized discharge- to-community (RSR j). To calculate the risk -standardized discharge- to-community rate for each facility, we used the following equation: RSR j=SRR j* (5) NOTE: Because the statistic described in Step 6 is a complex function of parameter estimates, re- sampling using bootstrapping may be necessary to derive a confidence interval estimate for the final risk - standardized rate to characterize the uncertainty of the estimate. See Appendix B for risk adjustment model results and providers' observed and risk- standardized score distributions. 27 Chapter 2 Standardized Patient Assessment Data Elements Section 1: Introduction The Improving Medicare Post- Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (IMPACT Act) requires CMS to develop, implement, and maintain standardized patient assessment data elements (SPADEs) for PAC settings. The four PAC settings specified in the IMPACT Act are HHAs, IRFs, LTCHs, and SNFs. The goals of implementing cross -settin g SPADEs are to facilitate care coordination and interoperability and to improve Medicare beneficiary outcomes. Existing PAC assessment instruments (i.e., OASIS for HHAs, IRF- PAI for IRFs, LCDS for LTCHs, and the MDS for SNFs) oft en collect data elements pertaining to similar concepts, but the individual data elements \u2014questions and response options\u2014vary by assessment instrument. With a few exceptions, the data elements collected in these assessment instruments are not currently standardized or interoperable; therefore, patient responses across the assessment instruments cannot be compared easily. The IMPACT Act further requires that the assessment instruments described above be modified to include core data elements on health assessment categories and that such data be standardized and interoperable. Implementation of a core set of standardized assessment items across PAC settings has important implications for Medicare beneficiaries, families, providers, and policymakers. CMS is adopting SPADEs for five ca tegories specified in the IMPACT Act: 1. Cognitive function (e.g., able to express ideas and to understand normal speech) and mental status (e.g., depression and dementia) 2. Special services, treatments, and interventions (e.g., need for ventilator, dialysis, chemotherapy, and total parenteral nutrition) 3. Medical conditions and co morbidities (e.g., diabetes, heart failure, and pressure ulcers) 4. Impairments (e.g., incontinence; impaired ability to hear, see, or swallow) 5. Other categories as deemed necessary by the Secretary Background In the following sections, we present additional information on the SPADEs finalized in the FY 2020 SNF PPS final r ule. We outline how each SPADE is relevant to the care of residents in the SNF , review its current use in existing P AC assessment item sets, and summarize any prior testing of the data elements. For SPADEs that were included in the National Beta Test, which was conducted by RAND between November 2017 and August 2018, we present detailed information on data element perfo rmance. Evidence supporting the se SPADEs comes from several sources, including the Post- Acute Care Payment Reform Demonstration (PAC PRD), MDS 3.0 testing, and the National Beta Test. The most relevant metrics for evaluation of SPADE p erformance (i.e., fe asibility and reliability) include the amount of missing data, time to administer the data element, and interrater reliability (IRR) . IRR is the level of agreement between two raters; that is, the extent to which two different individuals would code the sa me response when presented with the same information. Typically, percent agreement and the kappa statistic \u2014or weighted kappas, for ordinal data \u2014are used to represent IRR. The kappa statistic is preferred in most cases because there are agreed -upon conventi ons for its interpretation and it corrects for chance agreement between raters. However, kappa is sensitive to prevalence rates; when prevalence rates are extremely high or low, the resulting kappa statistic does not accurately convey the level of agreemen t. 56 56 Cicchetti , D. V., & Feinstein, A. R. (1990). High agreement but low kappa: II. Resolving the paradoxes. Journal of Clinical Epidemiology , 43(6), 551 -558. https://doi.org/10.1016/0895 -4356(90)90159-M 28 In those cases, percent agreement is preferred. The evidence offered for the SPADEs in the sections below follow standard conventions in reporting both percent agreement and kappas or weighted kappas to describe IRR. Post-Acute Car e Payment Reform Demonst ration (PAC PRD) Some prior evidence for these SPADEs comes from the PAC PRD. The PAC PRD was mandated by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 to examine the relative costliness and outcomes of similar types of Medicare beneficiaries d ischarged to different PAC settings (i.e., HHAs, IRFs, LTCHs, and SNFs). To meet these aims, the study collected standardized assessment data, using the Continuity Assessment Record and Evaluation (CARE) across PAC settings to measure patient severity and case mix across settings at more than 200 providers in 11 geographically diverse markets. The standardized assessment data allowed cross- setting comparisons of the factors associated with costs and outcomes, as well as service substitution among post- acute providers, all else being equal about the patient. Further information on the design and methods of the PAC PRD can be found at https://www.cms.gov/Research Minimum Data Set 3.0 (MDS 3.0) Additional testing information comes from the national testing of the MDS 3.0.57 During a 6- year period starting in 2003, CMS engaged in a national project to create an improved version of the MDS 2.0. A joint RAND/Harvard team employed an iterative development process that culminated in the national testing of the MDS 3.0 in 2006 and 2007. The national validation and evaluation testing of the MDS 3.0 included 71 community nursing homes (3,822 residents) and 19 Veterans Health Administration nursing homes (764 residents), distributed throughout the regions of the United States. The evaluation was designed to test and analyze IRR, validity of key items, response rates for interview items, feedback on changes from participating nurses, and time to complete the MDS assessmen t. In addition, the nati onal test design allowed comparison of item distributions between MDS 3.0 and MDS 2.0. Further information on the design and methods of MDS 3.0 testing can be found at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality - Initiatives -Patient -Assessment - Instruments/NursingHomeQualityInits/downloads/MDS30FinalReport.pdf . National Beta Test Purpose and goals The National Beta Test was conducted to evaluate the reliability and validity of candidate SPADEs and to support the identification of data elements for standardization across PAC settings, in accordance with the mandates of the IMPACT Act. To test SPADE performance within ea ch setting, sufficient numbers of patients/residents needed to be included in each of the four settings to enable setting -specific performance estimates. Further, the participating patients/residents needed to represent adequate cov erage of the clinical range of patients/residents receiving care nationally in each of the four PAC settings. To evaluate the suitability of the SPADEs for cross- setting use, sufficient numbers of Xu, S., & Lorber, M. F. (2014).

These f acilities/agencies needed to reflect a reasonable range of geographic diversity relative to PAC settings nationally. Many large national studies of patients and health conditions are designed to generate estimates and make comparisons of rates of conditions or severity of patients on one or more clinical characteristics (e.g., cognitive status). To do this, these studies seek to recruit a proportionally balanced representative sample, and employ case- mix models and/or sampling weights to the data. In contr ast, the National Beta Test was designed to generate valid and robust national SPADE performance estimates (i.e., time to complete and IRR), which fundamentally requires acceptable geographic diversity, sufficient sample size, and r easonable coverage of th e range of clinical characteristics. To meet these requirements, the National Beta Test was carefully designed so data could be collected from a wide range of environments, allowing for thorough evaluation of candidate SPADE perform ance in all PAC settings. These analyses included extensive checks on the sampling design (e.g., generating results by market and by urbanicity) to identify possible limitations to the generalizability of results. Results of these sensitivity analyses are not included in this doc ument, but will be described in detail in the forthcoming volumes of the National Beta Test Final Report (see https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality -Initiatives ). To help readers interpret evidence from the National Beta Test that is included for some SPADEs, we include an abridged description of the National Beta Test design and methods below. An in -depth technical discussion of the design and methods of the National Beta Test ca n be found in the document titled \" Development and Evaluation Candidate Standardized Patient Assessment Data Elements: Findings from the National Beta Test (Volume 2),\" available at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality -Initiatives Act-Downloads-and-Videos.html . Design and sampling The National Beta Test included PAC providers in 14 geographic/metropolitan areas, or \"markets,\" across the country. This number was chosen to be similar to the design used for the PAC PRD. A multistage s tratified random sampling plan was used to obtain the sample of 14markets in the United States, and then a sample of eligible PAC facilities was compiled from those markets. To be eligible for selection, markets had to meet the following criteria: Sampled markets would yield a predefined number of PAC facilities/agencies of each type for the sample (12 SNFs, 10 HHAs, at least four LTCHs or IRFs, and at least one LTCH) The predefined number of facilities/agencies within the markets were expected to have flow rates large enough to obtain the targeted number of assessments per facility The predefined number of facilities/agencies had to be loc ated within 2 hours of one another to facilitate completion of assessments in a timely manner Of 306 markets in the United States , 64 were deemed eligible. The random sampling of the 14 markets was stratified by U.S. Census division to enhance geographic r epresentation , yielding the following 14 markets: Boston, MA; Chicago, IL ; Dallas, TX ; Durham, NC ; Fort Lauderdale, FL; Harrisburg, VA ; Houston, TX ; Kansas City, MO ; Los Angeles, CA ; Nashville, TN ; Philadelphia, PA; Phoenix, AZ; St. Louis, MO ; and San Diego, CA. Because these markets are a random sample, they are expected to be representative of the set of 64 eligible facilities and findings are therefore generalizable to the set of eligible facilities. The target numbers of providers by setting within these 14 markets were 28 IRFs, 28 LTCHs, 84 SNFs, and 70 HHAs, totaling 210 PAC providers. The number of settings was determined based on standard sample size calculations, which included the numbers of facilities and patients rather than the 30 proportions of t he populations they represented. The power calculations indicated that 28 providers per setting type (two in each market) would yield enough admissions during the field period to obtain robust estimates of candidate SPADE performance. This minimum number was adopted as the recruitment target for IRFs and LTCHs; additional SNFs and HHAs were targeted to enhance sample diversity in light of the larger proportion of these setting types nationally. A total of 143 PAC facilities (35 HHAs, 22 IRFs, 26 LTCHs, 60 S NFs) were successfully recruited across 14 U.S. markets to participate in the National Beta Test. Although this number falls short of targets both overall and by setting, this shortfall was offset by extending the field period, allowing for the accrual of more eligible patient/resident admissions and discharges. Eligibility The National Beta Test SPADEs included in this ru le were evaluated for performance among a sample o f communicative patients/residents (who could make themselves understood through any means). All communicative patients/residents who were admitted to a participating provider site during the field period a nd were Medicare beneficiaries covered under one o f the PAC PPSs were eligible for the admission assessment, and all those who completed an admission assessment and were discharged during the field period were eligible for the discharge assessment. Nationa l Beta Test enrollment of non- communicative patients/residents was not tied to an admission date so as to ensure availability of sufficient numbers within the field period for evaluation of three data elements developed specifically for non-communicative p atients/residents (observational assessments of co gnitive status, mood, and pain). Although this ensured availability of sufficient numbers of non- communicative patients/residents for testing of the non- communicative data elements, it precluded assessing t hese patients/residents with non- interview SPADEs at admission. The three data elements developed specifically for non -communicative patients/residents are not included in this rule; thus, the non-communicative sample from the National Beta Test is not described further here. Section 1557 of the Patient P rotection and Affordable Care Act states that facilities that deliver PAC services under Medicare are required to provide qualified interpreters to their patients/residents with limited English proficiency. 58 Facilities have discretion in how they furnish q ualified interpreters, including the use of remote interpreters (i.e., high- quality telephone or video services). As described above, the focus of the National Beta Test was to establish the feasibility and validity of the data elements within and across P AC settings. Including limited English proficiency patients/residents in the sample would have required the National Beta Test facilities to engage or involve translators during the test assessments. In planning the National Beta Test, we anticipated that this would have added undue complexity to what facilities/agencies were being asked to do, and would have undermined the ability of facility/agency staff to complete the requested number of assessments within the assessment window (e.g., Admission Days 3-7) and within the study field period. In light of the strong existing evidence for the feasibility of all patient/resident interview SPADEs included in this rule (B rief Interview for Mental Status [BIMS] , Pain Interference, Patient Health Questionnaire [ PHQ] ) when administered in other languages, either through standard PAC workflow (e.g., as tested and currently collected in the MDS 3.0) and/or through rigorous translation and testing (e.g., PHQ), the perfor mance of translated versions of these patient/resi dent interview SPADEs did not need to be further evaluated. In addition, because their exclusion did not threaten our ability to achieve acceptable geographic diversity, sufficient sample size, and reasonable coverage of the range of PAC patient/resident c linical characteristics, t he exclusion of limited English proficiency patients/residents was not considered a limitation to interpretation of the National Beta Test results. 58 For more information, see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for -individuals/section -1557/index.html 31 Data c ollection Admission assessments were completed between admission days 3 -7; discharge assessments could be completed from 2 days before discharge through the discharge date. Trained research nurses and staff at participating PAC facilities /agencies administered all assessments. A subset of the admission assessments was completed by research nurse/facility staff assessor pairs to allow for evaluation of IRR . Power analyses indicated that reliability estimates required a minimum of 194 paired assessments, time to complete estimates could be compared across settings for detection of small effect sizes with a minimum of 274 assessments per setting, and as few as 460 assessments would be sufficient to evaluate aspects of validity (e.g., group differences, associations with other clinical variables, etc.) with small to moderate effect sizes. Therefore, average assessment contributions per participating facility/agency were calculated for each of these goals (i.e., paired assessments, assessments completed by facility/agency staff, total admission assessments) and communicated throughout the study period to guide the data collection and track progress. These minimums were more easily attainable in SNFs and HHAs because of the larger number of participating facilities/agencies. However, participating LTCHs and IRFs also were able to collec tively meet these targets by the end of the field period. The total number of admission assessments is shown in Appendix C, Table 1.1. This table also shows the number of assessments from which completion tim es were estimated, and the number of assessments that were conducted by paired raters and contributed to evaluation of IRR. In addition to meeting the minimum sample size requirements, the data collection yielded very small rates of missing data, speaking to the overall feasibility of the SPADEs. Table 1.2 in Appendix C shows completion rates by National Beta Test protocol module. Module completion rates ranged from 93.8 to 98.2 percent, and nearly 90 percent of the communicative admission sample completed all assessment modules. More information on the design and methods of the National Beta Test can be found in the document \"Development and Evaluation Candidate Standardized Patient Assessment Data Elements: Findings from the National Beta Test (Volume 2),\" available at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality -Initiatives . 32 Section 2: Cognitive Function Impairments in cognitive function can result from many underlying conditions, including dementia, Alzhei mer's Disease, stroke, brain injury, side effects of medication, metabolic and endocrine imbalances, and delirium.59 Cognitive impairments may affect a patient or resident's ability to recover from illness or injury, or they may be a sign of an acute condition (e.g., hypoxia) that requires immediate intervention. Cognitive impairment that manifests with behavioral s ymptoms\u2014or that impairs a patient's ability to communicate, prompting behavioral disturbances\u2014may put the patient or resident or others in the ca re setting at risk for injury or assault, or may signal unmet patient or resident needs (e.g., pain management). Screening for the presence of impairment can help ensure appropriate and timely intervention. A substantial proportion of PAC patients and resi dents experience cognitive impairment, delirium, communication impairment, or behavioral distress. Testing from the PAC PRD found that about one-third of patients and residents in PAC settings were classified as having moderately or severely impaired cogni tive function. 60 About one-third exhibited disorganized thinking and altered level of consciousness, and about one- half exhibited inattention. Fewer than 7 percent of patients and residents exhibited signs and symptoms of behavioral distress in the PAC PRD. Therapeutic interventions can improve patient outcomes, and evidence suggests that treatment (e.g., drugs, phy sical activity) can stabilize or delay symptom progression in some patients, thereby improving quality of life.61, In addition, assessments help PAC providers better understand the needs of patients and residents by establishing a baseline for identifying changes in cognitive function and mental status (e.g., delirium), elucidating the patient's ability to understand and participate in treatments during their stay, highlighting safety needs (e.g., to prevent falls), and identifying appropriate support needs at the time of discharge. The standardized assessment of patient or resident cognition supports clinical decision making, early clinical interven tion, person-centered care, and improved care continuity and coordination. The use of valid and reliable standa rdized assessments can aid in the communication of information within and across providers, enabling the transfer of accurate health information. CMS has identified several data elements as applicable for cross- setting use in standardized assessment of co gnitive impairment. 1. The B IMS 2. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) The data elements involve different aspects of cognition (e.g., short- term memory, comprehension) and types of data (e.g., interview, performance -based) . They are collected by various modes (e.g., clinician assessed, patient reported). 59 National Institute on Aging. (2013). Assessing cognitive impairment in older patients .

The BIMS evaluates repetition, recall with and without prompting, and temporal orientation. Relevance to SNFs The BIMS is currently a central component of the cognitive function data elements submitted by SNF providers through the MDS 3.0 and, as a screening tool, has been shown to accurately predict formal diagnoses of impaired cognitive function in nursing homes.62 The assessment of cognitive function in SNF residents is essent ial due to the substantial number of residents affected by cognitive impairments and its potential to impact ca re, health, and cost outcomes. BIMS data from the PAC PRD63 show that approximately 33 percent of Medicare FFS SNF residents are moderately to sev erely cognitively impaired. Furthermore, the BIMS has been shown to be an efficient assessment that is feasible to administer under the time constraints faced by nursing home staff, and suitable for use by all levels of staff that contribute to resident as sessment, including paraprofessionals.64 Results of the BIMS' screening for cognitive impairment can be used to initiate appropriate therapy in a timely fashion, to establish a baseline for identifying changes in cognitive function over time, and to inform staff about a resident's ability to understand and participate in treatments during their stay and about what supports and services will likely be needed at the time of discharge. The standardized assessment of cognitive function using the BIMS data elemen ts would provide important information for care planning, care transitions, patient safety, and resource use in SNFs.

Prior evidence supporting use of the BIMS The BIMS data elements were tested in the PAC PRD, where they showed substantial to almost perfect reliability of 0.71 to 0.91 (weighted kappas) when used across all four PAC settings. The lowest agreement was on the \"repetition of three words\" memory data element, with a kappa of 0.71, which still falls within the range of substantial agreement. PAC PRD testing also demonstrated the feasibility of the BIMS for use in SNF s and found evidence of strong reliability of the BIMS data elements in the SNF setting. In addition, the BIMS data elements were found to be predictive of higher patient cost.65 The BIMS data elements were also included in the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes and showed almost perfect reliability.66 Agreement ranged from 0.86 to 0.99 (standard kappa). The BIMS data elements were found to be highly correlated (0.906) with a gold- standard measure of cognitive functio n, the Modified Mini -Mental Status (3MS) exam.67 Evidence supporting use of the BIMS from the National Beta Test Assessing impairment: In the National Beta Test, the BIMS was administered at admission to 646 patients/residents in HHAs, 786 in and 1,134 in SNFs (n=3,062 overall). Overall, 5 percent of patients/residents met criteria for being severely impaired, 18 percent for being moderately impaired, and 76 percent for being intact. In the SNF setting, 7 percent were severely impaired, 22 percent were moderately impaired, and 72 percent were intact. SNF residents showed similar impairment levels to patients in the LTCH setting and somewhat greater impairment than those in an IRF or HHA. Setting -specific admission frequencies for BIMS data elements and the overall impairment category at admission are shown in Appendix C, Table 2.1.1. Missing data: In general, there were low rates of missing data for BIMS items. I tem-level missing data ranged from 0.4 to 1.7 percent overall and ranged from 0.3 to 1.1 percent in the SNF setting. For all settings, missing data rates were slightly higher for recall of current day of the week. In general, the low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time t o complete: To assess feasibility of administration, the length of time to administer the BIMS was assessed among 445 patients/residents in HHA s, 537 IRFs, 332 in LTCHs, and 494 in SNFs (n=1,808 overall). Overall mean time to complete the BIMS was 2.2 minutes ( standard deviation [SD]=1.2 minutes). Time to complete in the SNF se tting was 2.2 minutes (SD = 1.1 minutes). Interrater reliability: The IRR was excellent for the BIMS , as measured by kappa and percent agreement of paired raters (n =966 pair ed assessments across settings; n =270 paired assessments in 65 Gage, Morley, et al., 2012. 66 Saliba, D., & B uchanan, J.

Delirium screening: a systematic review of delirium screening tools in hospitalized patients. The Gerontologist, 55(6), 1079 -1099. 36 SNFs). Across all settings and in the IRF setting, the kappa for the BIMS Impairment Category classification (based on the BIMS total score) was 0.91. The kappas for individual items within the BIMS ranged from 0.83 to 0.93 across all settings and ranged from 0.78 to 0.93 i n the SNF setting. Overall kappa values were not estimated for two items within the BIMS because the proportion of patients across settings with correct responses was out of range for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement for the BIMS Impairment Category classification was 96 percent across all settings and 95 percent in the SNF setting. Percent agreement for the individual items ranged from 94 to 98 percent across settings and from 91 to 97 percent in SNFs. Please refer to Table 2.1.2 in Appendix C fo r kappa and percent agreement statistics for all BIMS items. Confusion Assessment Method (CAM\u00a9) The C AM is a widely used delirium screening tool.68 Delirium, when undetected or untreated, can increase the likelihood of complications, rehospitalization, and death relative to patients/residents without delirium.69 Although multiple versions of the CAM have been developed, CMS finalized that the short version be adopted for SPADEs . The Short CAM contains only four items (i.e., items 1 to 4) from the original CAM (Long CAM). These items focus on an acute change in men tal status, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. Relevance to SNFs The four-item Short CAM is currently used, in combination with other data elements, to assess SNF residents' mental status. The CAM allows trained facili ty staff to identify delirium with sensitivity and specificity, even in populations with a high prevalence of dementia.70 As assessed in the PAC PRD using the CAM, many SNF residents showed signs or sy mptoms of delirium: of residents in SNFs ex hibited inattention, 34.9 percent had disorganized thinking, and 14.9 percent had an altered level of consciousness.71 Assessing mental status of SNF residents has several benefits, including establish ing a baseline for recognizing changes in mental status, highlighting threats to patient safety (e.g., risk of falls), and helping clinicians identify appropriate treatment and supports to be incorporated into care plans. SNF residents with delirium are mo re likely to experience new complications and be re- hospitalized, and less likely to be discharged to the community within 30 days. 72 The standardized assessment of cognitive impairment, including delirium and reversible confusion using the Short CAM data elements, would provide important information for care pl anning, care transitions, patient safety, and resource use in SNFs. 68 De & Wand, 2015. 69 Marcanto nio, E.

Cu rrent use The Short CAM data elements are currently collected in the MDS and the LCDS, and the scoring is based on staff observations of signs and symptoms of delirium. Although the Short CAM data elements are used in both assessment tools, the response options curr ently differ. The current version of the LCDS includes two response options (yes/no, indicating that the behavior is present or not present), whereas the MDS offers three response options (behavior continuously present, does not fluctuate; behavior present, fluctuates; behavior not present). The LCDS and MDS versions of the CAM also differ slightly in wording and criteria for the \"Altered Level of Consciousness \" item. Prior evidence supporting use of the CAM A version of the CAM with an item added to asses s psychomotor retardation was tested in the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes. Reliabilities were substantial or almost perfect. Overall average kappa ranged from 0.85 to 0.89, and items ranged from 0.78 to 0.90 (standard kappa). 73 Based on a meta- analysis of diagnostic accuracy in nine studies, the CAM demonstrated moderate sensitivity (82 percent, 73 Saliba & Buchanan, 2008b. 38 95 percent confidence interval: 69-91 percent) and high specificity (99 percent, 95 percent confidence interval : 87-100 percent), respec tively, using a delirium diagnosis (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV) as the standard.74 Evidence supporting use of the CAM from the National Beta Test Assessing impairment: In the National Beta Test, we administered the version of t he CAM that is currently collected in the MDS 3.0, that is, the version with three response options. The CAM was administered at admission to 630 patients/residents in HHA, 771 (n=2,973 overall). Overall, 5 percent of patients/residents had evidence of mental status change from baseline, 12 percent had difficulty focusing (3 percent continuously), 6 percent had disorganized thinking (1 percent continuously), and 4 percent had alt ered consciousness (1 percent continuou sly). In the SNF setting specifically, 4 percent of residents had evidence of mental status change from baseline, 11 percent had difficulty focusing (3 percent continuously), 7 percent had disorganized thinking (1 per cent continuously), and 4 percent had altered consciousness (1 percent continuously). Setting -specific frequencies for CAM data elements at admission are shown in Appendix C, Table 2.2.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing data for the CAM. Across all settings, item-level missing data did not exceed 0.4 percent for any of the four CAM items. Similarly, in the SNF setting , item-level missing data did not exceed 0.4 percent. For all settings, missing data rates were slightly higher fo r the change in mental status from baseline item (0.4 percent missing). In general, the low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: To assess feasibility of administration, time to complete was assessed for 375 patie nts/residents in HHAs, 472 in IRFs, 284 in LTCH s, and 405 in SNFs (n =1,536 overall). Overall the mean time to complete the CAM was 1.4 minutes (SD =0.7 minutes). In the SNF setting, the mean time to complete the CAM was 1.4 minutes (SD = 0.7 minutes). Interrater reliability: The IRR was good for the CAM , as measured by kappa and percent agreement of paired raters (n =914 paired assessments across settings; n = 257 paired assessments in SNFs). The kappa for the focusing attention item was good both overa ll (0.66) and in the SNF setting (0.70). Kappa was not estimated for the other three items within the CAM for the overall sample, or for two of these items within SNFs, because the proportion of patients/residents across settings with correct responses was out of range for a stable kappa estimate. For the disorganized thinking item, kappa was substantial/good (0.68) in SNF. Percent agreement for the CAM across settings was high for all four CAM items: evidence of change of mental status from baseline (96 percent) and wh ether the patient had difficulty focusing attention (91 percent), had disorganized thinking (94 percent), and had altered consciousness (96 percent). Percent agreement in the SNF setting was similarly high for the four CAM items (97 percent, 93 percent, 94 percent, and 96 percent, respectively). Please refer to Table 2.2.2 in Appendix C for kappa and percent agreement statistics for all CAM items. Mental Status (Depressed Mood) Depression is the most common mental health condition in older adults, yet underrecognized and thus undertreated. Existing data show that depressed mood is relatively common in patients and residents receiving PAC services. The PAC PRD found that about 9 percent of individuals in PAC were classified as likely to have depr ession.75 The prevalence varied from a low of 7 percent of beneficiaries in SNFs to a 74 Shi, Q., Warren, L., Saposnik, G., & Macdermid, J.

If they responded \"often\" or \"always,\" they were conside red to have depression. 39 high of 11 percent of patients in IRFs.76 Almost half of nursing home residents in the United States with an active diagnosis of depression at the time of admission are not receiving ps ychiatric treatment (medication or psychological therapy) for the condition.77 Older adults with depression may exhibit different symptoms than younger adults, including fatigue, insomnia, irritable mood, confusion, and lack of focus.78 Some med ications and medical conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer, may also cause depressive symptoms in older adults.26 Diagnosis and treatment of depression can lead to significant improvement of symptoms, as measured on depression assessment scales. Depressi ve symptoms improve in 60 to 80 percent of elderly patients taking an antidepressant medication.79 Psychosocial treatments of depression in older adults have been shown to be more effective than no treatment, according to self-rated and clinici an-rated measures of depression.80 Assessments of the signs and symptoms of depression help PAC providers better understand the needs of their patients and residents by prompting further evaluation (i.e., to establish a diagnosis of depression); elucidatin g the patient 's or resident's ability to participate in therapies for conditions other than depression during their stay; and identifying appropriate ongoing treatment and support needs at the time of discharge. The standardized assessment of depression am ong PAC patie nts and residents supports clinical decision making, early clinical intervention, person- centered care, and improved care continuity and coordination. The use of valid and reliable standardized assessments can aid in the communication of infor mation within and across providers, further enabling the transfer of accurate health information. Standardized Data Elements to Assess Depressed Mood CMS has identified the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 to 9 (PHQ-2 to 9) data elements for standardized assessment of de pressed mood. Patient Health Questionnaire -2 to 9 (PHQ- 2 to 9) The PHQ -2 to 9 data elements use a summed -item scoring approach to first screen for signs and symptoms of depressed mood in patients and residents by assessing the two cardinal cr iteria for depression: depressed mood and anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure).81 At least one of the two must be present for a determination of probable depression, which signals the need for continued assessment of the additional seven PHQ symptoms. The interview is concluded if a respondent screens negative for the first two symptoms. Relevance to SNFs Major depressive disorder is common in SNF residents, with a prevalence of 7.3 percent, as assessed in the PAC PRD. 82 When signs and symptoms of depression are identified, treatments are available to alleviate suffering and improve clinical outcomes, prevent recurrence of symptoms, and 76 Gage, Morley, et al., 2012. 77 Ulbricht, C.

The PHQ- 2 is a subset of the PHQ -9, which is currently used by SNF providers to screen for the si gns and symptoms of depression. The PHQ-9 is reported in the MDS 3.0. The standardized assessment of screening for the signs and symptoms of depression using the PHQ-2 would provide important information for care planning, care transitions, and resource us e in SNFs . Note that the two items of PHQ-2 are the first two items in the PHQ -9. 41 Data Elements for the Assessment of Cognitive Function: PHQ -2 to 9 D0150. Resident Mood Interview (PHQ -2 to 9) Say to resident : \"Over t he last 2 weeks, have you been bothe red by any of the following problems? \" If symptom is present, enter 1 (yes) in column 1, Symptom Presence. If yes in column 1, then ask the resident : \"About how often have you been bothered by this ?\" Read and show the re sident a card with the symptom frequency choices. Indicate response in column 2, Symptom Frequency. 1. Symptom Presence 0. No (enter 0 in column 2) 1. Yes (enter 0 -3 in column 2) 9. No response (leave column 2 blank) 2. Symptom Frequency 0.

Enter 99 if unable to complete interview (i.e., Symptom Frequency is blank for 3 or more required items) Current use The PHQ -2 data elements are currently in use in the OASIS. The PHQ-9 data elements, which include the two questions used in the PHQ-2 plus additional items, are in use in MDS. 42 Prior evidence supporting use of PHQ -2 and PHQ-9 The PHQ -2 is a brief, reliable screening tool for assessing signs and symptoms of depression. Among studies conducted in primary care centers with large samples of adults, the PHQ-2 has performed well as both a screening tool for identifying depression and an assessment of depression severity. 83 It has also been shown to be sensitive to changes in a patient 's mood. Across 15 studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the PHQ -2 against a recognized gold- standard instrument for the diagnosis of major depression in adults, sensitivity estimates (based on the summed -item approach to scoring and a cutoff score of 3) have varied, ranging between 39 percent and 97 percent (median value = 77 percent); specificity estimates (based on the summed -item approach to scoring and a cutoff score of 3) have been higher and more stable, ranging between 74 percent and 97 percent (median value = 90 percent).84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 It is thus a viable option for standardization, with the benefits of the shorter assessment counterbalancing the limitation of the lower sensitivity. 83 L\u00f6we, B., Kroenke, K., & Gr\u00e4fe, K.

The PHQ -9 for detection of major depressive disorder in primary care: consequences of current thresholds in a cross -sectional study. BMC Fam ily Practice 11(1): 98. 43 The PHQ -9 was also tested in the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes. For the two presence items in the PHQ -2 (little interest in doing things; feeling down, depressed, or hopeless), kappa statistics were almost perfect and ranged from 0.98 to 0.99.99 The PHQ -9 was also found to have agreement with the Modified Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (m -SADS), a gold- standard measure for mood disorder, in residents without severe cognitive impairment (weighted kappa =0.69) and with the Cornell Depression Scale, a gold -standard measure for mood disorder, in residents with severe cognitive impairment (correlation =0.63).100 In addition, the Staff Time and Resource Intensity Verification ( STRIVE) study, conducted in a national sample of nursing homes by CMS, concluded that the PHQ-9 used in the MDS 3.0 was the \"best measure\" for identifying individuals with higher wage- weighted staff time, defined as the time that nursing home staff spent c aring for residents.101 Evidence supporting use of PHQ -2 to 9 from the National Beta Test Assessing depressed mood: The PHQ -2 to 9 was administered to assess depressed mood in the National Beta Test. As a hybrid measure, the PHQ -2 to 9 uses the first two ele ments (PHQ -2) as a gateway item for the longer PHQ -9. The assessor only administers the full PHQ -9 if the initial score on the PHQ-2 passes a threshold indicating possible depression. A patient/resident who did not show signs of depression in the PHQ -2 would not receive the seven additional elements contained in the PHQ -9. In the National Beta Test, the PHQ -2 to 9 was administered to 646 patients/residents in HHAs, 786 in IRFs, and 1,134 in SNFs (n =3,062 overall). Across settings, 38 percent of patients/residents reported having little interest in doing things and 43 percent reported feeling down, depressed, or hopeless at some point in the last 14 days. Among SNF residents, 35 percent reported h aving little interest in doing things, and 42 percent reported feeling down, depressed, or hopeless. For each of these two symptoms, about 1 in 10 SNF residents had experienced them nearly every day over the past 2 weeks. More than one in four patients/re sidents (28 percent) across settings passed the PHQ -2 to 9 threshold based on one or both of these symptoms, and continued to complete the remaining seven data elements. This positive screen rate was similar in the SNF setting (27 percent). Detailed sympto m endorsement and frequency for the PHQ-2 to 9 is shown in Appendix C, Table 3.1.1. The average PHQ - 2-only score across settings was 2.4 (SD = 1.7), and 2.4 (SD = 1.7) in the SNF setting. The average full PHQ -9 score across settings was 11.9 (SD =5.3), and the average score in the SNF setting was 11.5 (SD = 5.1) . The PHQ -9 has thresholds to indicate the severity of probable depression. 102 Across settings, the largest groups of patients/residents screening positive on the PHQ -2 and continuing on to complete the full PHQ -9 were the mild (31 percent) and moderate (32 percent) severity groups. The same trend was noted in SNF , with most patients/residents being classified in the mild (33 percent) or moderate (34 percent) severity group. The mean scores and severit y threshold proportions are shown in Table 3.1.1 of Appendix C. Missing data: Overall, there were low rates of missing data for the PHQ -2 to 9. Across all settings, item -level missing data did not exceed 5.2 percent for any of the i tems. Similarly, in the SNF setting, item -level missing data did not exceed 6.9 percent for any of the items. Missing data rates, overall and in IRFs, were greatest for the moving and speaking slowly item. In general, the low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administ ration. 99 Saliba & Buchanan, 2008b. 100 Ibid. 101 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. (2013).

Among patients/residents who only received the PHQ- 2, time to complete was an average of 1.7 minutes (SD =1.1). The a verage time to complete the PHQ -2 in the SNF setting was 1.7 minutes (SD = 1.1). Among patients receiving the full PHQ -9, the time to complete was an average of 4.0 minutes (SD =1.2). In the SNF setting, the time to complete the PHQ-9 was 4.1 minutes on average (SD =1.2). Without regard for PHQ- 2 versus PHQ -9 stratification, the mood data elements took an average of 2.3 minutes (SD =1.5) to complete across settings, and 2.3 minutes (SD = 1.5) in the SNF sett ing. Interrater reliability: IRR was HHA s, 254 in IRFs, 231 in LTCHs, and 267 in SNFs (n=948 overall). IRR for all symptom presence and frequency items was excellent: kappas ranged from 0.95 to 1.00 for the four set tings combined and from 0.94 to 1.00 in SNF s. IRR regarding eligibility for the full PHQ -9 based on PHQ- 2 responses was nearly perfect: kappa for whether to continue from the PHQ- 2 to the full PHQ -9 was 0.98 across settings and in SNF s. Finally, for patients/residents who received the full PHQ-9, the IRR for sum of symptom frequencies was nearly perfect (0.96 overall and 0.97 in SNF s). Percent agreement was also nearly perfect, ranging from 97 percent to 100 percent overall and 96 percent to 100 percent in SNF s. For eligibility to complete the full PHQ -9, percent agreement was 99 percent across settings and in SNFs. For the sum of symptom frequencies, percent agreement was 95 percent across settings and 96 percent in SNF s. Please refer to Table 3.1.2 in Appendix C for kappa and percent agreement statistics for all PHQ items. 45 Section 3: Special Services, Treatments, and Interventions (Including Nutritional Approaches) Some medical conditions require complex clinical care, consisting of special services, treatments, and interventions. The implementation of these interventions typically indicates conditions of a more serious nature and can be life- sustaining. Patients and residents who need them may have few clinical alternatives. Conditions requiring the use of special services, treatments, and interventions can have a profound effect on an individual's health status, self-image, and quality of life. Providers should be a ware of the patient or resident's clinical needs to plan the provision of these important therapies, ensure the continued a ppropriateness of care, and support care transitions. The assessment of special services, treatments, and interventions may also help identify resource use intensity by capturing the medical complexity of patients/residents. Standardized Data Elements to Assess for Special Services, Treatments, and Interventions C MS has identified data elements for cross- setting standardization of assessment for special services, treatments, and interventions in the areas of cancer, respiratory, and other treatments, as well as nutritional approaches and high- risk medications. 1.

High -risk drug classes: use and indication Chemotherapy (IV, Oral, Other) Chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses medications to destroy cancer cells. Receipt of this treatment indicates that a patient has a malignancy (cancer) and therefore has a serious, often life- threatening or life -limiting condition. Both IV and oral chemotherapy have serious side effec ts, including nausea/vomiting, extreme fatigue, risk of inf ection (due to a suppressed immune system), anemia, and an increased risk of bleeding (due to low platelet counts). Oral chemotherapy can be as potent as chemotherapy given by IV but can be signifi cantly more convenient and less resource intensive to admin ister. Because of the toxicity of these agents, special care must be exercised in handling and transporting chemotherapy drugs. IV chemotherapy may be given by peripheral IV but is more commonly 46 given via an indwelling central line, which raises the risk of bloodstream infections. The need for chemotherapy predicts resource intensity, both because of the complexity of administering these potent, because of toxic drug combinations following specific protocols, and because of what the need for chemotherapy signals about the patient's underlying medical condition. Furthermore, the resource intensity of IV chemotherapy is higher than for oral chemotherapy, as the protocols for administration and the care of the central line (if present) require significant resou rces. Relevance to SNFs In one study using MDS data, approximately 1 in 10 nursing home residents were estimated to have a cancer affecting their health. 103 However, chemotherapy is not a common treatment for SNF residents. According to a RAND analysis of 2013 MDS data, 0.5 percent of SNF residents were receiving IV chemotherapy. Despite low prevalence of IV chemotherapy, this and other chemotherapy treatments are expensive and resource intensive. The refore , the standardized assessment of whether the resident is receiving chemotherapy would provide important information for care planning, clinical decision making, and resource use in SNFs.

The MDS data element does not assess the route of chemotherapy. 103 Johnson, V. M. P., Teno J. M., Bourbonniere, M., & Mor , V. (2005). Palliative care needs of cancer patients in U.S. nursing homes. Journal of Palliative Medicine, 8(2), 273- 279. 47 Prior evidence supporting use of Chemotherapy (IV, Oral, Other) An IV Chemotherapy data element was found to be feasible for cross- setting use in the PAC PRD.104 In nursing homes, a checkbox for chemotherapy during the last 5 days was shown to have perfect agreement (100 percent) among rater pairs in the national MDS 3.0 test.105 Evidence supporting use of Chemotherapy (IV, Oral, Other) from the National Beta Test Assessing Chemotherapy: One item assessed whether chemotherapy was performed during the assessment period. If indicated, three follow- up items asses sed whether the chemotherapy was administered intravenous ly, oral ly, or by another route. In the National Beta Test, the data elements were administered to 629 patients/residents in HHAs, 762 1,087 in SNF s (n=2,926 overall). Across settings, the overwhelming majority of patients/residents (99 percent) did not receive chemotherapy. In the SNF specifically, 1 percent had chemotherapy treatment noted. More- detailed rates of chemotherapy implementation across se ttings are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.1.1. Missing data: Overall, rates of missing responses for the Chemotherapy items were very low . Across all settings, missingness did not exceed 0.7 percent for each of the four items. In the SNF setting , missingness was 0.9 percent for each of the four items. The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs, 244 in LTCHs, and 431 in SNFs (n=1,554 overall). The a verage time to complete the Chemotherapy items was 0.22 minutes overall (SD =0.1) and 0.21 minutes in the SNF setting (SD=0.1). Interrater reliability: The IRR was excellent for the Chemotherapy data element as measured by percent agreement of paired raters (n =882 paired assessments across settings; n = 256 paired assessments in SNF). Kappas were not estimated for the Chemotherapy data element because the proportion of patients and residents receiving chemotherapy was out of range for stable kappa estimates. Percent agreement was p erfect (100 percent) for all four c hemotherapy items across settings and 99 to 100 percent in the SNF setting . Please refer to Table 4.1.2 in Appendix C for percent agreement statistics for the Chemothe rapy items. Radiation Radiation is a type of cancer treatment that uses high -energy radiation to shrink tumors and kill cancer cells by damaging their DNA. However, it can also damage normal cells, leading to side effects such as fatigue, skin irritation or damage, hair loss, nausea, and delayed side effects such as fibrosis (scar tissue formation), damage to the bowels if radiation was delivered to the abdominal region, memory loss, and, infrequently, a second cancer due to radiation exposure. Radiation is a mainstay of cancer treatment; about half t o two -thirds of all patients with cancer receive radiation therapy at some point in their treatment course. 106 The indications range from early -stage cancer treated with curative intent to palliative radiation the rapy, such as to treat metastatic cancer; tum ors that are pressing on the spine or growing within bones, causing severe pain; or shrinking a tumor near the esophagus, which can inhibit 104 Gage, B, Constantine, R, Aggarwal, J, Morley, M, Kurlantzick , VG, Bernard, S, ...Ehrlich -Jones, L.

There are many types of radiation, such as external- beam radiation therapy , internal radiation therapy (brachytherapy that is delivered from sources placed inside or on the body), and systemic radiation therapy (in which the patient swallows or receives an injection of a radioactive substance). Relevance to SNFs Radiation is an important therapy for particul ar types of cancer . The resource utilization is high, with frequent radiation sessions required, often daily for several weeks. According to a RAND analysis of 2013 MDS data, 0.3 percent of SNF residents were re ceiving radiation treatment. Despite low prev alence of radiation treatment , assessment upon admission to a SNF is important for coordinating special services, equipment, and staff required to deliver a possible increase in the intensity and quantity of skilled nursing care. Receipt of radiation therapy typically indicates a higher level of resident acuity. Therefore, the standardized assessment of whether the resident is receiving radiation would provide important information for care planning, clinical decision making, and resource use in SNFs.

Kappas are not reported for the Radiation data element because its proportion w as out of range for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement for the Radiation data element was perfect, both across settings and in the SNF specif ically. Please refer to Table 4.2.2 in Appendix C for percent agreement statistics for the Radiation items. Oxygen Therapy (Int ermittent, Continuous, High-C oncentration Oxygen D elivery S ystem) Oxygen therapy provides a patient/resident with supplemental oxygen when medical conditions (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], pneumonia, severe asthma) prevent the patient or resident from adequately oxygenating their bloodstream. Oxygen administration is a resource- intensive intervention, as it requires specialized equipment: a reliable source of oxygen, various delivery systems (e.g., oxygen concentrator, liquid oxygen containers, and high- pressure systems), and the patient interface (e.g., nasal cannula, various types of masks). Accessories are also required (regulators, filters, tubing, etc.). The equipment is generally the same for both sub -elements of this data element (continuous vs. intermittent) . The main differences between delivering oxygen intermittently versus continuously are the severit y of the underlying illness (which often requires more hours per day of oxygen therapy) and the bedside nursing care to set up the oxygen delivery system if the patient is unable (whether physically or cognitively) to do so independently. Relevance to SNF s A large portion of SNF residents receive oxygen therapy; a RAND analysis of 2013 MDS data found that 23.1 percent of SNF residents were on oxygen therapy. Residents with community-acquired pneumonia are routinely discharged to SNFs to complete their recove ry. SNFs also have a high proportion of residents with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly those who have severe COPD. Taken together, this indicates an increased burden and nursing need in SNFs for caring with residents with oxyge n and other respiratory needs. The standardized assessment of whether a resident is receiving oxygen therapy would provide important information for care planning, clinical decision making, care transitions, and resource use in SNFs.

The MDS data element does not assess the type of oxygen therapy. Prior evidence supporting use of Oxygen Therapy (Continuous, Intermittent, High -Concentration Oxygen D elivery System ) A related data element on high-concentration oxygen use (FiO2 >40 percent) was used and found feasible for cross- setting use in the PAC PRD.108 In nursing homes, a checkbox for oxygen therapy during the last 5 days was shown to have reliability ranging from 0.93 to 0.96 (kappas) in the national MDS 3.0 test.109 Eviden ce supporting use of Oxygen Therapy from the National Beta Test Assessing Oxygen Therapy: One item assessed whether oxygen therapy was performed during the assessment period. If indicated, three follow- up items assessed therap y type: intermittent, continuo us, and use of a h igh-concentration delivery s ystem. In the National Beta Test, the data element Oxygen Therapy (Intermittent, Continuous, High -Concentration Delivery System) w as administered to 629 patients/residents in HHA s, 762 and 1,087 in SNFs (n=2,926 overall). Across settings, one in five patients/residents (20 percent ), received oxygen therapy. In the SNF setting, about one in six residents (16 percent) received oxygen therapy. Across settings, the most common type of oxygen therapy was i ntermittent therapy (14 percent). Only 6 percent of patients/residents had continuous therapy, and 1 percent of patients/residents had a high-concentration delivery system, respectively. This pattern was similar in the SNF setting, where intermittent therapy was the most common (11 percent). Continuous therapy (5 percent ) and high - conce ntration delivery ( 0 percent ) were less common. Detailed oxygen therapy implementation data are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.3.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Oxygen Therapy items. Across all settings, missingness was less than 0.9 percent . Similarly, in the SNF setting specifically, missingness was less than 0.9 percent . The low rate of missing data indicates feas ibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs, 244 in LTCHs, and 431 in SNFs (n=1,554, overall). The a verage time to complete the Oxygen Therapy data element was 0.22 minutes overall (SD =0.1). The a verage time to complete the data element in the SNF setting was 0.21 minutes (SD =0.1). Interrater reliability: IRR 236 in IRFs , 203 in LTCHs, and 256 in SNFs (n=882 overall). Across settings, the kappa for implementation of oxygen therapy was substantia l/good overall (0.82) and slightly lower in the SNF setting (0.71). The kappa for the intermittent therapy sub-element was 0.81 overall and 0.75 in the SNF setting, and the kappa for the continuous therapy sub-element was 0.55 overall . Kappas are not reported for the Continuous Therapy sub-element in SNF, and High Concentration Therapy sub-elem ent overall and in SNF because the proportions with these were out of range for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement for the data element was excellent/almost perfect. Across settings, percent agreement ranged from 93 to 99 percent. Percent agreement in the SNF setting was also excellent/almost perfect , ranging from 91 to 100 percent. 108 Gage, Constantine, et al., 2012. 109 Saliba & Buchanan, 2008b. 51 Please refer to Table 4.3.2 in Appendix C for kappa and percent agreement statistics for all Oxygen Therapy items. Suctioning (Scheduled, As Needed) Suctioning is used t o clear secretions from the airway when a person cannot clear those secretions on his or her own for a variety of reasons, including excess production of secretions from a pulmonary infectious process or neurological deficits that inhibit the ability to cough, swallow, and so on. Suction is done by aspirating secretions through a catheter connected to a suction source. Types of suctioning include oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal suctioning; nasotracheal suctioning; and suctioning through an artificial airw ay, such as a tracheostomy tube. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal suctioning are a key part of many patients' care plans, both to prevent the accumulati on of secretions that can lead to aspiration pneumonias (a common condition in patients and residents wi th inadequate gag reflexes) and to relieve obstructions from mucus plugging during an acute or chronic respiratory infection, which often lead to desaturations and increased respiratory effort. Suctioning can be done on a scheduled basis, if the patient is judged to clinically benefit from regular interventions, or can be done as needed, such as when secretions become so prominent that gurgling or choking is noted, or a sudden desaturation occurs from a mucus plug. As suctioning is generally performed by a care provider rather than independently, this intervention can be quite resource intensive if it occurs every hour, for example, rather than once a shift. It also signifies an underlying medical condition that prevents patients/residents from clearing thei r secretions effectively, which also means they need increased nursing care more generally (such as after a stroke or during an acute respiratory infect ion). Relevance to SNFs A RAND analysis of 2013 MDS data found that 1.3 percent of SNF residents received suctioning. Suctioning is necessary to improve patient comfort, improve oxygenation, relieve mucus obstructions during respiratory infections, and pre vent aspiration pneumonias. Pneumonia itself is also a cause of excess secretions, which is a concern in the SNF setting: the attack rate for pneumonia is highest among those in nursing homes. 110 One study found that 33 of 1,000 nursing home residents per ye ar required hospitalization for treatment of pneumonia, compared with 1.14 of 1,000 elderly adults per y ear living in the community.111 The standardized assessment of whether suctioning is being performed for a resident would provide important information for care planning, clinical decision making, care transitions, and resource use in SNFs. 110 U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, U.S. Department of Defense, & U.S. Department of Vet erans Affairs (2013).

It first assesses whether the resident received suctioning while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 14 days, and then whether the resident received suctioning while a resident and within the last 14 days. The MDS data element does not assess whether the suctioning is scheduled or as needed. Prior evidence supporting use of Suctioning (Scheduled, As Needed) In the PAC PRD, suctioning was assessed as part of the Trach Tube with Suctioning data element , which evaluated whether patients or residents had a tracheostomy tube or needed suctioning. This related data element was found feasible for cross-setting use in the PAC PRD.112 In nursing homes, a checkbox for suctioning during the last 5 days was shown to have perfect agreement (100 percent) among rater pairs in the national MDS 3.0 test.113 Evidence supporting use of Suctioning (Scheduled, As Needed) from the National Beta Test Assessing Suctioning: One item assessed whether suctioning was provided during the assessment period. If indicated, two follow- up items assessed therapy type: scheduled or as needed. In the National Beta Test, the data element Suctioning (Scheduled, As Needed) was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHA s, 762 in and 1,087s in SNF s (n=2,926 overall). Across settings, most patients/residents (99 percent) did not have suctioning noted, and those that did noted \" as needed \" suctioning (1 percent). In SNF s, 1 percent of residents had s uctioning noted, also most often noted \" as needed \" (1 percent). Detailed suctioning findings are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.4.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Suctioning items. Across all settings, missingness was less than 0.9 percent . In the SNF setting specifically, missingness for any Suctioning item was less than 0.9 percent . The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration.

The a verage time to complete the Suctioning items was 0.22 minutes overall (SD =0.1) and 0.21 minutes in the SNF setting (SD =0.1). 112 Gage, Constantine, et al., 2012. 113 Saliba & Buchanan, 2008b. 53 Interrater reliability: IRR was examined 187 assessments HHA s, 236 in IRFs , 203 in LTCHs, and 256 in SNFs (n=882 overall). The IRR was excellent for the Suctioning data element , as measured by percent agreement of paired raters. Kappas were not estimated for the Suctioning data element because the proportion of patients and residents receiving suctioning was out of range for stable kappa estimates. Percent agreement for the data elements ranged from 98 to 99 percent across settings and 96 to 99 percent in the SNF setting. Please refer to Table 4.4.2 in Appendix C for kappa and percent agreement statistics for all suctioning items. Tracheostomy Care A tracheotomy is a surgical procedure that consists of maki ng a direct airway opening (tracheostomy) into the trachea (windpipe). Tracheostomies are created primarily to bypass an obstructed upper airway; in chronic cases, to enable the removal of secretio ns from the airway; and to deliver oxygen to the patient's lungs. For example, some indications for tracheostomy include a need for long- term ventilation (such as those in a persistent vegetative state or those who require long -term ventilator weaning but are alert and oriented); tumors of the upper airway; severe neck, mouth, or chest wall injuries; degenerative neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); spinal cord injuries; and airway burns. Generally, suctioning is necessary to ensure that the tracheostomy is clear of secretions, which can inhibit successful oxygenation. Often, individuals with tracheostomies also receiv e supplemental oxygenation. The presence of a tracheostomy, permanent or temporary, warrants careful monitoring and immediate intervention if the tracheostomy becomes occluded or, in the case of a temporary tracheostomy, if the devices used become dislodged. For patients/residents with a tracheostomy, tracheostomy care, which primarily consists of cleaning, dressing changes, and replacement of the tracheostomy cannula (tub e), is a critical part of their care plans. Regular cleaning is important to prevent infection, such as pneumonia, and to prevent any occlusions, which create the risk of inadequate oxygenation. Al though in rare cases , the presence of a tracheostomy is not associated with increased care demands (and in some of those instances, the care of the tracheostomy is performed by the patient), in general, the presence of such a device is associated with increased patient risk, and clinical care services will necessarily include close monitoring to ensure that no life- threatening events occur because of the tracheostomy. Relevance to SNFs Although only 1.3 percent of SNF residents received t racheostomy c are, 114 maintenance and support of tracheostomies require increased resources, as above with suctioning, among other things. Residents with tracheostomies are at relatively high risk of hospital acquired infections or other complications, and require close monitoring to ensure that their tracheostomy is patent, enabling the resident to breathe or be mechanically ventilated through the tracheostomy. The standardized assessment of whether t racheostomy care is being performed for a resident would provide important information for care pla nning, clinical decision making, care transitions, and resource use in SNFs. 114 A RAND anal ysis of 2013 MDS data. 54 Data Element for the Assessment of Special Services, Treatments, and Interventions: Tracheostomy Care O0110.

Detail ed tracheostomy care findings across settings are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.5.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Tracheostomy Care item. Across all settings, missingness was 1.2 percent. Similarly, in the SNF setting , missingness was 1.1 percent . The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of adm inistration.

Percent agreement for the data element was 100 percent across settings and in the SNF setting. Please refer to Table 4.5.2 in Appendix C for percent agreement statistics for the Tracheostomy Care item. 115 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 55 Non-invasive Mechanical Ventilation (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure [BiPAP], Continuous Positive Airway Pressure [CPAP]) BiPAP and CPAP are respiratory support devices that prevent the airways from closing by delivering slightly pressurized air through a mask continuously or via electronic cycling throughout the breathing cycle. A BiPAP/CPAP mask supports breathing by providing positive airway pressure that prevents airways from collapsing during the respiratory cycle. Non- invasive mechanical ventilation differs from invasive mechanical ventilation because the interface with the patient is a mask rather than an endotracheal tube in the windpipe. BiPAP and CPAP have a variety of clinical indications, from obstructive sleep apnea, to acute respiratory infections, to progressive neuromuscular decline leading to respiratory failure. The key difference between BiPAP and CPA P is that BiPAP, as the name implies, delivers two different pressure levels (a higher pressure to support inhalation and a lower pressure to prevent the airways from collapsing during exhalation ), whereas CPAP delivers the same am ount of positive airway pressure throughout the breathing cycle. These interventions signify underlying medical conditions in the patient who requires their use. Relevance to SNFs A RAND analysis of 2013 MDS data found that 2.8 percent of SNF residents received non- invasive m echan ical v entilation (BiPAP/CPAP). However, there is a trend of increased mechanical ventilation use in SNFs. One projection estimates that discharges to SNF for residents on mechanical ventilation can be expected to rise from 91,000 in 2000 to nearly 220,000 by 2020.116 A study of Medicare patients who were hospitalized for acute respiratory failure found that 23 percent were discharged into a nursing home or SNF .117 In fact, SNFs also may be a better setting for weaning from mechanical ventilation. A study on 1,127 resid ents in seven Florida locations found that \"a number of [resid ents] can be weaned from mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy in Skilled Nursing F acilities even when these [resid ents] were deemed unweanable in the acute care and/or LTACs [Long -Term Acute Care hospitals].\"118 The standardized assessment of Non -Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, including BiPAP and CPAP, would provide important information for care planning, care transitions, and resource use in SNFs. 116 Zilberberg, M., & Sh orr, A.

The MDS first assesses whether the residen t received non- invasive mechanical ventilation while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 14 days, and then whether the resident received non- invasive mechanical ventilation while a resident and within the last 14 days. The LCDS and MDS data elements do not assess whether the non -invasive mechanical ventilation is BiPAP or CPAP. Prior evidence supporting use of Non- invasive Mechanical Ventilation (BiPAP, CPAP) A checkbox item for non -invasive v entilation (CPAP) was tested in the PAC PRD and was found to be feasible for cross- setting use.119 Evidence supporting use of Non- invasive Mechanical Ventilation (BiPAP, CPAP) from the National Beta Test Assessing Non -invasive Mechanical Ventilation: One item assessed whether a non- invasive mechanical ventilator was noted during the assessment period. If indicated, two follow- up items assessed whether this non- invasive m echanical v entilator was Bi PAP or C PAP. In the National Beta Test, the data element was administered to 629 pati ents/residents in HHA s, and 1,087 in SNFs (n=2,926 overall). Across settings overall, 5 percent of assessments noted use of a non- invasive mechanical v entilator . In the SNF setting specifically, a non- invasive m echanical ventilator was noted for 4 percent of residents . With regard to specific non- invasive m echanical v entilator , 2 percent of assessments across settin gs noted BiPAP and 3 percent noted CPAP. In SNF s specifically , CPAP was 3 percent and BiPAP was 1 percent. Detailed findings regarding non- invasive mechanical ventilators are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.7.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Non -invasive Mechanical Ventilator items. Across all settings, missingness did not exceed 1.2 percent. In the SNF setting specifically, missingness did not exceed 1.1 percent .

The a verage time to complete the Non - invasive Mechanical Ventilator items was 0.22 minutes overall (SD =0.1) and 0.21 minutes in the SNF setting (SD =0.1). Interrater reliability: IRR was examined assessments s, 236 in IRFs , 203 in LTCHs, and in SNFs (n=882 overall). Most kappas for the Non- invasive Mechanical Ventilator items are not reported because their proportions were out of range for stable kappa estimates. Percent agreement for the data elements ranged from 9 7 to 98 percent across settings and from 98 to 100 percent in the SNF setting. Please refer to Table 4.7.2 in Appendix C for percent agreement statistics for all Non- invasive Mechanical Ventilator items across settings. Invasive Mechanical Ventilator Invas ive mechanical ventilator includes any type of electrically or pneumatically powered closed - system mechanical support devices to ensure adequate ventilation of patients who are unable to support their own respiration. Patients /residents receiving closed -system ventilation include those receiving ventilation via a tracheostomy and patients /residents with an endotracheal tube ( i.e., nasa lly or orally intubated). Depending on the patient/resident's underlying diagnosis, clinical condition, and prognosis, the p atient may not be a candidate for weaning off the ventilator. For instance, certain medical conditions such as lung infections are expected to improve or resolve to a point where patients can support their own respiration, whereas chronic neurodegenerative diseases are likely to progress over time and therefore preclude patients from weaning and eventually having the tube removed. Ventilation in this manner is a resource- intensive therapy associated with l ife-threatening conditions in which the patient wou ld not survive without invasive ventilation . However, ventilator use has inherent risks requiring close monitoring, and failure to adequately care for ventilator -dependent patient s can lead to death, pneumonia, sepsis, and other iatrogenic events. Mechanical ventilation further signifies the complexity of the patient's underlying medical and/or surgical condition. Relevance to SNFs Although invasive mechanical ventilation is not common in the SNF setting, with less than 1 percent of residents on ventilator or respirator, 120 invasive mechanical ventilation is resource intensive and can indicate the complexity of the resident's underlying medical condition. The standardized assessment of whether the resident is on i nvasive m echanical ventilation would provide i mportant information for care planning, clinical decision making, care transitions, and resource use in SNFs.

Invasive Mechanical Ventilator (ventilator or respirator) 120 RAND analysis of 2013 MDS data. 58 Current use Invasive mechanical ventilator use is currently assessed in the LCDS and MDS. The MDS first assesses whether the resident received invasive mechanical ventilation while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 14 days, and then whether the resident received invasive mechanical ventilation while a resident and within the last 14 days. The LCDS includes an item that assesses use and type of invasive mechanical ventilator support (e.g., weaning or non-weaning). Prior evidence supporting use of Invasive Mechanical Ventilator Checkbox items for ventilator (weaning and non- weaning) were tested in the PAC PRD and were found to be feasible fo r cross -setting use.121 A version of the item was tested in the MDS 3.0 National Evaluation Study and had perfect agreement (100 percent).122 Evidence supporting use of Invasive Mechanical Venti lator from the National Beta Test Assessing Invasive Mechanical Ventilator: One item assessed whether an invasive mechanical ventilator was noted during the assessment period. In the National Beta Test, the data element was administered to 629 patients/res idents in 1,087 in SNFs (n=2,926 overall). Across settings overall, only 13 assessments (0 percent after rounding) noted use of an invasive m echanical v entilator . In SNF, no residents had i nvasive m echanical v entilato r noted . Detailed invasive m echanical v entilator findings across settings are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.6.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Invasive Mechanical Ventilator item. Across all settings, missingness was 1.2 percent for the item. In the SNF setting specifically, missingness was 1.1 percent . The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs, 244 in LTCHs, and 431 in SNFs (n=1,554 overall). The a verage time to complete the Invasive Mechanical Ventilator item was 0.22 minutes overall (SD =0.1) and 0.25 minutes in the SNF setting (SD=0.1). Interrater reliability: IRR was examined for 1 87 assessments in HHA s, 236 in IRFs, 203 in LTCHs, and 256 in SNFs (n=882 overall). The IRR was excellent for the Invasive Mechanical Ventilator data element , as measured by percent agreement of paired raters. The k appa was not estimated for the Invasive Mechanical Ventilator data element be cause the proportion was out of range for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement for the data element was 100 percent across settings and in the SNF setting. Please refer to Table 4.6.2 in Appendix C for percent ag reement statistics for the Invasive Mechanical Ventilator item across all settings. IV Medications (Antibiotics, Anticoagulation, Vasoactive Medications, Other) IV medications are drugs or biologics that are administered via intravenous push (bolus), single, intermittent, or continuous infusio n through a tube placed into the vein, including one that allows the fluids to enter the circulation through one of the larger heart vessels or more peripherally through a vein, e.g., commonly referred to as central midline, or peripheral ports. This data element is important to collect, as IV medications are more resource intensive to administer than oral medications and signify a higher patient complexity (and often higher severity of illness). The clinical indicatio ns for each of the sub types of IV medi cations (antibiotics, anticoagulants, vasoactive, and other) are very different. IV antibiotics are used for severe infections when (1) the bioavailability of the oral form of the medication would be inadequate to kill the pathogen, (2 ) an oral form of the medication does not exist , or (3) the patient is unable to take the medication by mouth. 121 Gage, Constantine, et al., 201 2. 122 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 59 Because of growing concern about antimicrobial resistance, antibiotic stewardship initiatives are aimed at increasing evidence-based antibiotic prescribing and decreasing antibiotic overuse. Although data on which antibiotic s are used would not be collected, collecting data on the use of IV antibiotics overall in the four PAC settings would assist with monitoring the implementation of evidence-based prescribing guidelines moving forward. IV anticoagulants refer to anti -clotting medications (\"blood thinners\") often used for the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and other thromboembolic complications. IV anticoagulants are commonly used in patients /residen ts with limited mobility (either chronically or acutely, in the post -operative setting), who are therefore at risk of deep vein thrombosis, or patients/residents with certain cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation. When a patient /resident is on an IV anticoagulant, they require frequent monitoring of laboratory values to ensure appropriate anticoagulation status. Vasoactive medications affect blood pressure and/or heart rate by causing dilation or constricting of the blood vessels. Vasoactive medications are used to treat septic shock, cardiac arrest, and other cardiac function issues. Continuous infusions of vasoactive medications require close observation of the patient, including constant monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate, in order to respond quickly to any changes. Relevance to SNFs A RAND analysis of 2013 MDS data found that 7.9 percent of SNF residents received IV medications. The indications, risks, and benefits of each of these classes of IV medications are distinct, making it imp ortant to assess each separately in PAC; k nowing not only whether or not residents are receiving IV medication but also the type of medication will be helpful in the SNF setting. The standardized assessment of IV medications, including the type of medications, would provide important information for care p lanning, clinical decision making, patient safety, care transitions, and resource use in SNFs.

The LCDS uses a checklist format, including an item at admission asking whether the patient is receiving any IV m edications. The MDS first assesses whether the resident received IV medications while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 14 days, and then whether the resident received IV medications while a resident and within the last 14 days. The MDS data element does not assess the type of IV medications. Prior evidence supporting use of IV Medications A similar but more focused data element, IV Vasoactive Medications, was tested in the PAC PRD and found to be feasible across PAC settings. This data element was specifi c to the IV administration of vasoactive drugs (e. g., pressors, dilators, continuous medication for pulmonary edema) that increase or decrease blood pressure and/or heart rate. In nursing homes, a checkbox for IV medications during the last 5 days was sho wn to have reliability of 0.95 (kappa) in the national MDS 3.0 test. 123 Evidence supporting use of IV Medications from the National Beta Test Assessing IV Medications : One item assessed whether IV medications were noted during the assessment period. If indic ated, three follow -up items assessed specific types of IV m edications (antibiotics, a nticoagulation, or other). In the National Beta Test, the data element was administered to 629 patients/residen ts in HHA s, and 1,087 in SNFs (n =2,926 overall). Across settings, one in four assessments (25 percent) had IV m edications noted. For specific types of IV m edication, 16 percent had antibiotics noted, 8 percent had a nticoagulat ion noted, and 7 percent had other IV medications noted. In SNF specifically, about one in six patients/residents (16 percent) had IV medications noted. For the specific types of IV medication, 9percent had antibiotics noted, 6 percent had anticoagulation noted, and 4 percent had other IV medications noted. Detail ed IV medications findings across settings are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.8.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the IV Medications items. Across all settings, missingness was less than 0.9 percent. In the SNF setting, missingness for the IV Medication items did not exceed 1.1 percent . The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs, 244 in LTCHs , and 431 in SNFs (n=1,554, overall). The a verage time to complete the IV Medications items was 0.22 minutes overall (SD =0.1) and 0.21 minutes in the SNF setting (SD=0.1). Interrater re liability: IRR was examined assessments HHA s, 236 in IRFs , 203 in LTCHs, and 256 in SNFs (n=882 overall). With the exception of the anticoagulation sub -element, the IRRs were fair to good for the IV Medications data elements, as measured by kappa and percent agreement of paired raters. The kappa for the overarching IV Medications data element was 0.70 across settings and 0.52 in the SNF setting. The kappa for the Antibiotics sub- element was 0.88 across settings and 0.78 in the SNF setting. The kappa for the Anticoagulation sub- element was 0.13 across settings, placing it in the \"slight/poor\" range. Consultation with assessors suggested that this low kappa was likely caused by inconsistent interpretation of the coding instructions, which will be improved in the future with more -comprehensive guidance. The kappa for the Other sub- element was 0.46 across settings. Kappa was not estimated for the Anticoagulation and Other data elements among SNF residents because the proportions were out of range for stable kappa estimate s. Percent agreement for the data element ranged from 88 to 96 percent across settings and from 87 to 96 percent in the SNF setting. Please refer to Table 4.8.2 in Appendix C for IRR statistics for all IV Medications items. 123 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 61 Transfusio ns Transfusions are the administration of blood or blood products (e.g., platelets, synthetic blood products) into the bloodstream. Blood transfusions are highly protocolized, with multiple safety checks and monitoring required during and after the infusion to avoid adverse events. Coordination with the facility's blood bank is necessary, as well as documentation by clinical staff to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, the need for transfusions signifies underlying patient complexit y that is likely to require additional nursing staff and care coordination, and affec ts planning for transitions of care, as transfusions are not performed in all PAC settings. Receipt of transfusions is also important to assess for case mix adjustment because of the need for added resources and to the extent that receipt of transfusions i ndicates a more medically complex patient. Relevance to SNFs One study found that 3.5 percent of residents had received a blood transfusion sometime during their stay at a SNF. 124 Knowing about prior transfusions is important for management as well, as transf usions require close monitoring because of the possibility of infection or complications. Transfusions are resource intensive, requiring coordination among the blood bank and bedside care staff, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent adverse reactions, which may range from mild to severe. The standardized assessment of whether the resident requires transfusions would provide important information for care planning, clinical decision making, patient safety, care transitions, and resource use in SNFs.

Transfusions Current use Transfusions are currently assessed in the MDS. It first assesses whether the resident received transfusions while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 14 days, and then whether the resident received transfusions while a resident and within the last 14 days. Prior evidence suppo rting use of Transfusions In nursing homes, a checkbox for transfusions in the past 5 days was shown to have reliability of 0.67 (kappa) in the national MDS 3.0 test.125 Evidence supporting use of Transfusions from the National Beta Test Assessing Transfusi ons: One item assessed whether transfusions were performed during the assessment period. In the National Beta Test, the data element was administered to 629 pat ients/residents in HHAs, 762 in in SNFs (n =2,926 overall). Acros s settings, only 14 124 Rogers, M. A.

Detailed transfusion findings across settings are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.9.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Transfusions item. Across all settings, missingness was 1.0 percent for the item. In the SNF setting specifically, missingness was 1.1 percent. The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administrati on. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs, 244 in LTCHs, and 431 in SNFs (n=1,554, overall). The a verage time to complete the Transfusion item was 0.22 minutes overall (SD =0.1) and 0.21 minutes in the SNF setting (SD=0.1). Interrater reliability: IRR was examined s, 236 in IRFs , 203 in LTCHs, and 256 in SNF s (n=882 overall). Kappas are not reported for the Transfusions data element because the proportion was out of range for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement for the Transfusions data element was perfect overall and in the SNF specifically (100 percent) . Please refer to Table 4.9.2 in Appendix C for setting- specific percent agreement statistics for the Transfusion item. Dialysis (Hemodialysis, Peritoneal dialysis) Dialysis is used primarily in the case of end -stage kidney failure. It is a process by which waste, salt, and excess water are removed from the body and key electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate are maintained at a safe level. Hemodialysis is conducted using an artificial kidney, an external hemodialyzer, which fi lters the blood. During peritoneal dialysis, the dialysate is injected into the peritoneal (abdominal) cavity, excess fluid and waste products are drawn out of the blood and into the dialysate, and the fluid is then drained. Hemodialysis sessions are typically performed three times a week and last up to 4 hours each. Peritoneal dialysis can be performed continuously ov ernight or intermittently during the day. Both forms of dialysis (hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) are resource intensive, not only during the actual dialysis process but before, during, and after . Patients /residents who need and undergo dialysis proc edures are at high risk for physiologic and hemodynamic instability from fluid shifts and electrolyte disturbances , as well as infections that can lead to sepsis. Further, patients /residents receiving hemodialysis are often transported to a different facil ity, or, at a minimum, to a different part of the facility if the SNF is adjacent to a dialysis center or provides dialysis services on site. Close monitoring for fluid shifts, blood pressure abnormalities, and other adverse effects is required before , during, and after each dialysis session. Nursing staff typically perform peritoneal dialysis at the bedside, and, as with hemodialysis, close mo nitoring is required. Relevance to SNFs Currently, the MDS gathers information about dialysis, but it does not dis tinguish between the types of dialysis. According to a RAND analysis of 2013 MDS data, 3.0 percent of SNF residents received dialysis.126 Each type of dialysis (i.e., hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis) has advantages and disadvantages: peritoneal dialysis (P D) can be done overnight, allowing the resid ents to spend their days in other activities rather than traveling for hemodialysis, and it offers cost savings (about $20,000 lower per year), though both kinds are covered by Medicare. It is important to track resid ents who receive this service because they are at risk for infe ction, and likely have chronic diseases that will require ongoing care. T he standardized assessment of Dialysis (Hemodialysis, Peritoneal dialysis) would provide important information for care planning, clinical decision making, patient safety, care transi tions, and resource use in SNFs. 126 RAND analysis of 2013 MDS data. 63 Data Element for the Assessment of Special Services, Treatments, and Interventions: Dialysis O0110.

Hemodialysis J3. Peritoneal dialysis Current use The data element Dialysis is currently assessed in the LCDS and MDS. The LCDS uses a checklist format, including an item asking whether the patient receives dialysis as part of the patient's treatment plan. The MDS first assesses whether the resident received dialysis while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 14 days, and then whether the resident received dialysis while a resident and within the last 14 days. The LCDS and MDS data elements do not assess the type of dialysis. Prior evidence supporting use of Di alysis (Hemodialysis, Peritoneal dialysis) In nursing homes, a data element assessing dialysis in the past 5 days was tested in the nati onal MDS 3.0 test and shown to have almost perfect reliability (kappas of 0.91 to 0.93). 127 Evidence supporting use of Dialysis (Hemodialysis, Peritoneal dialysis) from the National Beta Test Assessing Dialysis : One item assessed whether d ialysis was noted during the assessment period. If indicated, two follow- up items assessed whether the dialys is was hemodialysis or peritoneal d ialysis . In the National Beta Test, the data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHA s setting, 762 in IRF in LTCH s, and 1,087 in SNFs (n=2,926 overall). Across settings overall, 5 percent of assessments noted use of d ialysis. In the SNF setting specifically, 3 percent of residents noted use of dialysis . With regard to specific forms of d ialysis, the vast maj ority of noted d ialysis was hemodialysis. Only seven assessments overall and one in SNF (both 0 percent after rounding) indicated peritoneal dialysis. Detailed findings regarding dialysis are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.10.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Dialysis items. Across all settings, missingness was less than 1 percent. In the SNF setting specifically, missingness was less than 1.1 percent. The low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs, 244 in LTCHs, and 431 in SNFs (n=1,554 overall). The a verage time to complete the Dialysis item was 0.22 minutes overall (SD =0.1) and 0.21 minutes in the SNF setting (SD =0.1). Interrater reliability: IRR was examined assessments s, 236 in IRFs , 203 in LTCHs, and 256 in SNFs (n=882 overall). Most kappas are not reported for the Dialysis data element because the proportions both overall and for each setting were out of range for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement for dialysis was nearly perfect overall and in the SNF specifically ( 99 percent ). The 127 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 64 same was true for the two types of dialysis across settings (98 percent and 100 percent, respectively) and in the SNF (99 percent and 100 percent, respectively) . Please refer to Table 4.10.2 in Appendix C for percent agreement statistics for all Dialysis items. IV Access (Peripheral IV, Midline, Central line) IV access refers to a catheter inserted into a vein for a variety of clinical reasons, including long - term medication treatment ; hemodialysis; large volumes of blood or fluid; frequent access for blood samples; IV fluid administration ; total parenteral nutrition ; or, in some instances, the measurement of central venous pressure. The sub- elements associated with IV a ccess distinguish between peripheral access and central access. In addition, different types of central access are specified. The rationale for distinguishing between a peripheral IV and central IV access is that central lines confer higher risks associated with life-threatening events such as pulmonary embolism, infection, and bleeding. Patients with central lines, including those peripherally inserted or who have subcutaneous central line \"port\" access, always require vigilant nursing care to ensure patency of the lines and, importantly , to ensure that such invasive lines are free from any potentially life-threatening events such as infection, air embolism, and bleeding from an open lumen. Relevance to SNFs In SNFs studied in the PAC PRD, 3.0 percent of residents were on central line management treatment, 128 one type of IV access. The standardized assessment of IV Access would provide important information for care planning, c linical decision making, patient safety, care transitions, and resource use in SNFs. See the \"IV Medications\" sections of this document for more information. Data Element for the Assessment of Special Services, Treatments, and Interventions: IV Access O0110.

Peripheral O3. Midline O4. Central (e. g., PICC, tunneled, port) Current use The IV Access data element is not currently included in any of the PAC assessments. Prior evidence supporting use of IV Access The IV Access data element was not tested in the PAC PRD , but that study did test a re lated data element, Central Line Management, whic h was found feasible for cross -setting use. 128 Gage , Morley, et al., 2012 . 65 Evidence supporting use of IV Access from the National Beta Test Assessing IV Access : One item assessed whether IV access was noted during the assessment period. If indicated, four follow- up items assessed whether the IV was a peripheral line, m idline catheter, central line , or other form of IV. In the National Beta Test, the data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHA s, 762 and 1,087 in SNFs (n=2,926 overall). Across settings, 24 percent of assessments noted use of IV access. In the SNF setting specifically, 10 percent of assessments noted use of IV a ccess. For the specific type of IV access noted, a central line was most common across setting s (13 percent), followed closely by peripheral IV (11 percent). Midline c atheter (2 percent) and other (1 percent) were less common. In the SNF setting, a central line was also most common (7 percent), followed by peripheral IV (2 percent), other IV (1 per cent), and midline catheter (0 percent). Detailed findings regarding IV access are shown in Appendix C, Table 4.11.1. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the IV Access items. Across all settings, missingness was less than 1.4 percent . In the SNF setting specifically, missingness was less than 0.7 percent . The low rates of missing data indicate feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs, 244 in LTCH s, and 431 in SNFs (n=1,554, overall). The a verage time to complete the IV Access item was 0.22 minutes overall (SD =0.1) and 0.21 minutes in IRFs (SD=0.1). Interrater reliability: 187 HHA s, 236 in IRFs, 203 in LTCHs, and 256 in SNFs (n=882 overall). IRR was excellent across settings for the IV Access item (kappa =0.90) and the peripheral and c entral types of access (kappa =0.81 and kappa =0.85, respectively ). Similarly, IRR was substantial/good in the S NF for the IV Access item (ka ppa = 0.74). The remaining kappas are not reported because the proportions were out of range for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement for the data element was almost perfect. Across settings, percent agreement was 96 percent for IV Access generally and the types of IV a ccess (96 to 98 percent). In the SNF specifically, percent agreement was 95 percent for the general IV Access item, and the subsequent types were also excellent or almost perfect ( 97 to 100 percent ). Please refer to Table 4.11.2 in Appe ndix C for kappa and percent agreement statistics for all IV Access items. Parenteral/IV Feeding Patients/residents can be fed parenterally (i.e., intravenously) to bypass the usual process of eating and digestion. The person r eceives nutritional formulas containing salts, glucose, amino acids, lipids, and added vitamins. Parenteral/IV feeding is often used after surgery, when feeding by mouth or digestive system is not possible, when a patient's digestive system cannot absorb n utrients because of chronic disease, or if a patient's nutritional requirement cannot be met by tube feeding and supplementation. The need for parenteral/IV feeding indicates a clinical complexity that prevents the patient from meeting nutritional needs en terally. Overall, parenteral/IV feeding is a form of nutritional support that can be used to prevent or address malnutrition. 129 Without treatment, malnutrition can lead to a host of negative consequences, including a decline in health, poorer physical and cognitive function, increased use of health care services, earlier institutionalization, and increased risk of death.130 Malnutri tion is prevalent among older adults, a population commonly served in PAC settings. A study showed that 58.3 percent of hospitalized patients diagnosed with malnutrition in the U.S. in 2010 129 National Collaborating Centre for Acute Care (UK). (2006).

The Permanente Journal , 9(3), 38 -41. https://doi.org/10.7812/TPP/05 -056 66 were more than 65 years of age .131 Additionally, as mentioned above, parenteral/IV feeding is often used to provide nutrition for patients with specific diseases. For example, parenteral/IV feeding can be used for individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, a condition that is common in older adults.132 Parenteral/IV feedi ng is more resource intensive than other forms of nutrition, as it often involves monitoring of blood chemistries and maintenance of a central line. Therefore, assessing a patient's need for parenteral feeding is important for care planning and case mix ad justment. In addition to the risks associated with central and peripheral IV access, parenteral/IV feeding is associated with significant risks, such as emboli sm and sepsis. Relevance to SNFs Parent eral/IV feeding is not common in the SNF setting. However, this service is important for treating a population at risk for undernutrition, such as SNF residents: a 2015 review found that approximately 20 percent of nursing home residents had some form of malnutrition.133 Another review of nursing home surveys found that for chronically institutionalized older people, from 5 to 18 percent of nursing home residents had energy intakes below need, and up to half of these individuals were underweight.134 Malnutrition has been linked to development of pressure sores135 and increased risk of mortality in or failure to return home from a SNF.136 The standardized assessment of Parenteral/IV Feeding would provide important information fo r care planning, care transitions, and resource use in SNFs. 131 Corkins, M.

Nutritional Approaches Check all of the following nutritional approaches that apply on admission 1. On Admission Check all that apply A. Parenteral/IV feeding Current use Different versions of the Parenteral/IV Feeding data element are currently collected in the OASIS, IRF -PAI, LCDS, and MDS. The OASIS data element a ssesses whether the patient is receiving parenteral nutrition at home. The IRF-PAI includes a checkbox data e lement to assess total parenteral nutrition with a 3-day look- back period. The LCDS includes a checklist to assess whether the patient receives tot al parenteral nutrition at admission. The MDS first assesses whether the patient received parent eral/IV feedi ng while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 7 days, and then whether the patient received parent eral/IV feeding while a r esident and within the last 7 days. Prior evidence supporting use of Parenteral/IV Feeding A similar data element, Total Parenteral Nutrition, was tested in the PAC PRD and found to be feasible across PAC settings. Parenter al/IV feeding in the last 5 days was shown to have almost perfect reliability (kappa of 0.95) in the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes.137 Evidence supporting use of Parenteral/IV Feeding from the National Beta Test Assessing Parenteral/IV Feeding: The Parenteral/IV Feeding data elem ent was included in the National Beta Test. This data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in H HAs, 762 in IRFs, , and 1,087 in SNF s (n=2,926 overall). Across settings, only 1 percent of assessments indicated parenteral/IV feedi ng. In the SNF setting, only two residents ( 0 percent after rounding) had parenteral/IV feeding noted. Detailed parenteral/IV feeding implementation is shown in Appendix C, Table 5.1.1, for all four settings. Missing data: Overall, there were very low rates of missing responses for the Parenteral/IV Feeding item . Across all settings, missingness was 1.3 per cent, and in the SNF setting, missingness was 1.7 percent. The low rates of missing data indicate feasibility of administration. Time to complete: Time t o complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs, 244 in LTCHs, and 431 in SNFs (n=1,554, overall). The a verage time to complete the Parenteral/IV Feeding item was 0.22 minutes overall (SD =0.1) and 0.21 minutes in the SNF setting (SD=0.1). Interrater reliability: IRR was examined s, 236 in IRFs , 203 in LTCHs, and 256 in SNFs (n=882 overall). Kappas are not reported for the parenteral/IV feeding data element because the proportion w as too low for a stable k appa estimate. Percent agreement was perfect at 100 percent for the Parenteral/IV feeding data element across settings and in the SNF setting . Please refer 137 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 68 to Table 5.1.2 in Appendix C for setting- specific percent agreement statistics for the Parenteral/IV Feeding item. Feeding Tube The Feeding Tube data element refers to enteral nutrition, which is the delivery of a nutritionally complete diet containing protein, carbohydrate, fat, water, minerals, and vitamins directly into the stoma ch, duodenum, or jejunum. It is typically used for patients/residents who have a functional gastrointestinal tract but are unable to maintain an adequate or safe oral intake. This data element assesses whether the patient/resident received enteral nutrition during the assessmen t period. Enteral nutrition is a form of nutritional support that can be used to prevent or address malnutrition.138 Without treatment, malnutrition can lead to a host of negative consequences, including a decline in health, poorer phys ical and cognitive function, increased use of health care services, earlier institutionalization, and increased risk of death.139 Malnutrition is prevalent among older adults, a population commonly served in PAC settings. A study showed that 58.3 percent of hospitalized patients diagnosed with malnutrition in the U.S. in 2010 were over 65 years of age. 140 Additionally, enteral nutrition can be used to provide nutrition for patients with specific diseases. For example, tube feeding can be used for individuals wi th stroke141 and those with head and neck cancer,142 conditions that are common in older adults.143 Assessing use of a feeding tube can inform resource use , care planning, and care transitions. Relevance to SNFs Patients/residents with severe malnutrition are a t higher risk for a va riety of complications.144 According to a RAND analysis of 2013 MDS data, 4.3 percent of SNF resid ents were on e nteral n utrition treatment. Most patients admitted to acute care hospitals experience deterioration of their nutritional status during their hospi tal stay, making assessment of nutritional status and method of feeding if unable to eat orally very important in the SNF setting.145 Additionally, the standardized assessment of enteral nutrition is useful for care planning , care trans itions, and resource use in SNFs , as enteral nutrition is most often used in medically complex resid ents and is a relatively resource-intensive feeding method, requiring frequent monitoring and administration. 138 National Alliance for Infusion Therapy and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Public Policy Committee and Board of Directors.

Nutritional Approaches Check all of the following nutritional approaches that apply on admission 1. On Admission Check all that apply B. Feeding tube (e.g., nasogastric or abdominal [PEG]) Current use A version of the Feeding Tube data element is currently assessed in three existing PAC assessments. The data element Enteral Nutrition is currently collected in the OASIS, with a question asking whether the patient is receiving enteral nutrition at home. I n the IRF- PAI, a Swallowing St atus data element captures some information related to enteral nutrition through the response option \"Tube/Parenteral Feeding.\" The MDS data element, Feeding Tube - N asogastric or A bdominal (PEG), first assesses whether a resi dent used a feeding tube while not a resident of the assessing facility and within the last 7 days and then whether the resident used a feeding tube while a resident and within the last 7 days. Prior evidence supporting use of Feeding Tube In the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes , the Feeding Tube data element, collected for the last 5 days, was shown to have almost perfect reliability (kappa of 0.89). 146 Evidence supporting use of Feeding Tube from the National Beta Test Assessing Feeding Tube: The Feeding Tube data element was included in the National Beta Test. This data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHA s, 762 in and 1,087 in SNFs (n =2,926 overall). Across settings, 3 percent of assessments indicated use of a feeding tube. In the SNF setting, 2 percent of assessments noted use of a feeding t ube. Detailed f eeding tube implementation is shown in Appendix C, Table 5.2.1, for all four settings. Missing data: There were very low rates of missing data for the Feeding Tube data element both overall (1.3 percent) and in the SNF setting ( 1.6 percent). Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 422 assessments in HHA s, 457 in IRFs, 244 in LTCHs , and 431 in SNF s (n=1,554 overall). The a verage time to complete the Feeding Tube item was 0.22 minutes overall (SD =0.1) and 0.21 minutes in the SNF setting (SD=0.1). Interrater reliability: IRR was examined s, 236 in IRFs , 203 in LTCHs, and 256 in SNF s (n=882 overall). Kappas are not reported for the Feeding Tube data element because the proportion w as too low for a stable kappa estimate. Percent agreement was 100 percent across settings and in the SNF setting. Please refer to Tabl e 5.2.2 in Appendix C for setting- specific percent agreement statistics for the Feeding Tube item. 146 Saliba, & Buchanan, 2008b. 70 Mechanically Altered Diet A mechanically altered diet is one that is specifically prepared to alter the texture or consistency of food to facilitate oral int ake. Examples include soft solids, pur eed foods, ground meat, and thickened liquids. A mechanically altered diet should not automatically be considered a therapeutic diet. The provision of a mechanically altered diet is resource intensive, as it signifies difficulty swallowing/eating safely (dysphagia). Often, nurses are required to slowly feed patients/residents meals consisting of a mechanically altered diet rather than having them eat independently. Dysphagia is frequently associated with various health conditions , including nervous system-related diseases (e.g., cerebral palsy and Parkinson's disease); stroke; head injury; head, neck, and esophagus cancers; head, neck, and chest injuries; and dementia.147 In the absence of treatment, swallowing diso rders can lead to malnutrition, dehydration, aspiration pneumonia, poor overall health, chronic lung disease, choking, and death.148 Other consequences can include lack of interest and enjoyment related to eating or drinking, and embarrassment or isolation t ied to social situations involving eating.149 Dysphagia is highly prevalent in older adults, a population commonly served in PAC settings. A study of a geriatric population living independently found that the lifetime prevalence of a swallowing disorder was 38 percent, and c urrent prevalence of a swallowing disorder was 33 percent. 150 Additionally, increasing age has been shown to be associated with a higher likelihood of swallowing problems in the previous year.151 Beyond general aging effects on swallowing phys iology, age -related disease is the main risk factor for dysphagia in older adults.152 Stroke and dementia are examples of common conditions among the elderly that may contribute to issues with swallowing.153 Furthermore, discharge to a PAC setting is more likely among those wi th dysphagia. A study examining burden among inpatients diagnosed with dysphagia found that individuals with dysphagia had a 33.2 percent higher likelihood of being discharged to a PAC facility than patients without dysphagia. 154 Assessing w hether a patient requires a mechanically altered diet is important in ensuring patient safety and can inform care planning, care transitions, and resource utilization. Relevance to SNFs Dysphagia is a common health care issue among nursing home residents a nd can lead to complications , including aspiration pneumonia and death.155 In one study, 45 out of 82 nursing home 147 National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders.

According to MDS 3.0 assessments in the third quarter of 2016, 34.2 percent of acti ve nursing home residents nationally received a mechanically altered diet.157 Although a resident's clinical condition may benefit from a mechanically altered diet, residents' preferences and overall clinical goals should also be considered , as these diets can also diminish an individual's sense of dignity and self- worth and diminish pleasure from eating. Residents may also be inappropriately placed on a mechanically altered diet ; one study found that although 31 percent of residents in two SNFs were prescribed a mechanically altered diet, most of them were able to eat at a higher level.158 The standardized assessment of whether a SNF resident requires a mechanically altered diet would provide important information for care planning, care trans itions, patient sa fety, and resource use in SNFs.

Mechanically altered diet - require change in texture of food or liquids (e.g., pureed food, thickened liquids) Current use Mechanically Altered Diet is currently assessed in the MDS. It first assesses whether the resident received a mechanically altered diet while not a resident and within the last 7 days, and then whether the resident received a mechanically altered diet while a resident and within the last 7 days. Prior evidence support ing use of Mechanically Al tered Diet In the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes, the Mechanically Altered Diet data element was shown to have almost perfect reliability (kappas from 0.90 to 0.96).159 Evidence supporting use of Mechanically Altered Diet f rom the National Beta Test Assessing Mechanically Altered Diet: The Mechanically Altered Diet data element was included in the National Beta Test. The data element was administered to 629 patients/residents in HHAs, 762 1,087 in SNFs (n =2,926 overall). Across settings, 10 percent of assessments 156 Kayser -Jones, J. & Pengilly , K. (1999).

IRR for the Mechanically Altered Diet data element was substantial/good both overall (kappa=0.65) and in the SNF setting specifically (kappa = 0.70). Percent agreement for the data element was 93 percent across settings and 94 percent in the SNF setting. Please refer to Table 5.3.2 in Appendix C for setting- specific kappa and percent agreement statistics for the Mechanically Altered Diet item. Therapeutic Diet A therapeutic diet is a diet intervention ordered by a health care practitioner as part of the treatment for a disease or clinical condition manifesting an altered nutrit ional status. This diet will eliminate, decrease, or increase certain substances in the diet (e.g., sodium or potassium). Therapeutic diets can include low cholesterol, renal, diabetic, and low salt diets,160 the latter of which are most commonly used.161 Certain conditions, including diabetes,162 chronic kidney disease,163 hypertension,164 and heart disease165 are highly prevale nt among older adults who may receive services in a PAC setting. For example, the percentage of adults with diabetes is 25.2 percent among in dividuals 65 years of age or older.166 Additionally, 61.7 percent of adults 65 years of age or older have hypertension.167 These conditions may be treated with a therapeutic diet. The Therapeutic Diet data element is important to collect in the SNF setting to distinguish therapeutic diet from various other nutritional approaches. It is less resource intensive from the beds ide nursing perspective but does signify one or more underlying clinical conditions that preclude the patient from eating a regular diet. Communication among PAC settings on whether a patient is receiving a particular therapeutic diet is critical to ensure safe transitions of care. 160 Kamel, H. K., Malekgoudarzi, B., & Pahlavan, M.

These diets are common among SNF residents. Currently, almost half of nursing home residents nationally (48.1 percent ) received a therapeutic diet.168 The standardized assessment of whether a resident requires a t herapeutic d iet would provide important information for care planning, clinical decision making, care transitions, and resource use in SNFs.

Please refer to Table 5.4.2 in Appendix C for setting- specific kappa and percent agreement statistics for the Therapeutic Diet item. High -Risk Drug Classes: Use and Indication Most patients and residents receiving PAC services depend on short - and long- term medications to manage their medical conditions. However, medications are a leading cause of adverse events. A study by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) found that 31 percent of adverse events in 2008 among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries were related to medication. 170 Adverse drug events (ADEs) may be caused by medication errors such as drug omissions, errors in dosage, and errors in dosing frequency.171 In addition, approximately half of all hospital- related medication errors and 20 percent of ADEs occur during transitions within, admission to, transfer to, or discharge from a hospital.172 ADEs are more common among older adults, who make up most patients and residents receiving PAC services. The rate of emergency department visits for ADEs is three times higher among adults 65 years of age and older than that among those younger than age 65.173 Some classes of drugs are associated with more risk than others.174 The six medication class response options in the High -Risk Drug Classes : Use and Indication data element are anticoagulants, antiplatelets , hypoglycemic s (including insulin), opioids , antipsychotics, and antibiotics. These drug classes are considered high -risk because of the adverse effects that may result from use. In particular, anticoagulants and antiplatelets are associated with bleeding risk;175 hypogl ycemics are associated with fluid retention, heart failure, and lactic acidosis;176 opioids are associated with misuse;177 antipsychotics are associated with fractures and strokes;178 and antimicrobials, the category of medications that includes 170 Levinson, D.

In a nationally representative sample in 2011, about 8 percent of Medicare beneficiaries residing in SNFs experienced some type of medication -related adverse event over a 1-month period, ranging in severity from a longer SNF stay to contributing to death; 37 percent of a ll adverse events were related to medication.182 In the same study, almost 5 percent of residents in SNFs experienced a medication -related \"temporary harm event\" during the 1-month period, defined as requiring medical intervention, but not causing lasting harm; 43 percent of all temporary harm events in SNFs were medication -related.183 The top three categories of adverse events related to medication s in SNFs were delirium and other changes in mental status due to medication, excessive bleeding due to medication, and fall or other trauma with injury secondary to effects of medication.184 The top three categories of temporary harm events related to medication s in SNFs were hypoglycemic episodes, fall or other trauma with injury associated with medication, and medication -induced delirium or other change in mental status.185 Assessing use of high -risk medications by SNF residents and indications for each medication would provide important information related to resident safet y in SNF s and care transitions between SNFs an d other settings. Medication classes received is currently assessed in the MDS. The number of days the resident received medication during the last 7 days is assessed for the following pharmacological drug clas ses: diuretic, and opioid. The standardized assessment of high-risk medication use and ensuring that indications are noted in the medical record are important steps toward overall medication safety within and between PAC provider settings. 179 Faulkner, C.

Prior evidence supporting use of High -Risk Drug Classes: U se and Indication The High -Risk Drug Classes: Use and Indication data element was not tested in prior demonstration efforts. However, the use of similar data elements in the MDS 3.0 spe ak to the feasibility of collecting data on patient medications in a standardized assessment. Evidence supporting use of High-Risk Drug Classes: Use and Indication from the National Beta Test Assessing High -Risk Drug Classes: Use and Indication: As part of the assessment of the medication r econciliation process, the National Beta Test included a data element that assesses whether the patient/resident was taking any medications in each of the six high -risk drug classes, and for each medication, whether there was a corresponding indication noted. The six classes are anticoagulants, antiplatelets (excluding low -dose aspirin), hypoglycemics (including insulin), opioids, antipsychotics, and antimicrobials (excluding topicals). In the National Beta Test, the data element was administered to 627 patients/residents in HHA s, 769 and 1,096 in SNFs (n=2,951 overall). 77 In the four settings combined, the percent age of patients/residents taking medications in each of the six classes ranged from 12 percent (antipsychotics) to 51 percent (opioids). In the SNF setting, these percentages ranged from 12 perce nt (antiplatelets) to 52 percent ( opioids). The presence of indications for noted medications in the various classes ranged from 45 percent (anticoagulants and a ntiplatelets) to 92 percent ( opioids) in the f our settings combined, and in the SNF setting , the indication percentages ranged from 72 percent (hypoglycemics) to 96 percent (opioids). The overall and setting-specific findings for each high -risk drug class are detailed in Table 6.1.1 in Appendix C. Missing data: There were very low rates of missing responses for the medication use items. In the four settings combined, missingness rates did not exceed 4.2 percent for any of the six drug class items. Similarly, in the SNF setting , missingness rates did not exceed 4.0 percent for the six drug class items. Missing data was also very low for indication items. Missingness rates did not exceed 1.2 percent across settings or in the SNF setting specifically. In general, the low rate of missing data indicates feas ibility of administration. Time to complete: Time to complete was examined among 406 assessments in HHA s, 446 in IRFs, 271 in LTCHs, and 421 in SNF s (n=1,544 overall). Average time to complete the H igh-Risk D rug Classes: Use and I ndication items was approximately 1.0 minute (SD =0.6 minutes) in the four settings combined and 1.0 minute (SD=0.6 minutes) in the SNF setting. Interrater reliability: IRR was examined for 187 assessments in HHA s, 240 in IRFs , 212 in LTCHs, and 261 in SNFs (n=900 overa ll). Kappas were not estimated across or within settings for items assessing antipsychotic use and indication of opioids or , in the SNF setting, items assessing antiplatelet use and indication of antimicrobials. These proportions were out of range for stable kappa estimates. In the four settings combined, I RRs across settings ranged from substantial/good to excellent/almost perfect (kappas =0.72 to 0.89) for medication use items. In the SNF setting, kappas for medication use were in the excellent/almost p erfect range (kappas = 0.82 to 0.90). For indication items, kappas ranged from substantial/good to excellent/almost perfect, both in the four settings combined (kappa = 0.65 to 0.87) and in the SNF setting (0.73 to 0.89). Percent agreement was very high fo r the medication use items, both in the four settings combined (92 to 95 percent) and in the SNF setting (91 to 96 percent). Similarly, percent agreement was generally high for indication items, both in the four settings combined (82 to 94 percent) and in the SNF setting (89 to 100 percent). More -detailed IRR statistics are shown in Appendix C, Table 6.1.2. 78 Section 4: Medical Conditions a nd Co -Morbidities Pain Interference Pain is a highly prevalent medical condition in the United States. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analysis of 2016 National Health Interview Study data found that 8 percent of Americans report high -impact chronic pain, that is, pain that limits life or work activities on most days or every day in the past 6 months.186 Pain in older adults occurs in conjunction with many acute and chronic conditions, such as osteoarthritis, leg pain during the night, canc er and associated treatment, neuralgia from diabetes mellitus, infections such as herpes zoster/shingles, and periphe ral vascular disease .187 Conditions causing pain in older adults may be associated with depression,188 sleep disturbance,189 and lower participat ion in rehabilitation activities. 190 A substantial percentage of older adults receiving services in a PAC setting experience pain. According to assessment testing performed in the PAC PRD, more than half of patients/residents in the PAC settings reported having experienced \"pain or hurting at any time during the last two days,\" with 55 percent in LTCHs, 65 percent in SNFs, 68 percent in IRFs, and 70 percent of patients/residents in HHAs responding \"yes\" to this question.191 According to the 2009 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, the prevalence of moderate- to-severe pain192 among residents of skilled and non- skilled nursing facilities was 22 percent, and the prevalence of persistent pain \u2014defined as the same or worse pain over time\u2014was 65 percent.193 Pain in olde r adults can be treated with medications, complementary and alternative approaches, or physical therapy.194 Treatment of pain in older adults may be complicated by factors such as dementia ; 186 Dahlhamer, J., Lucas, J., Zelaya, C., Nahin, R., Mackey, S., DeBar, L., . . .

From the 2018 National Beta Test , 78 percent of residents in the SNF setting reported having \"pain or hurting.\" Of those who reported pain, 63 percent experienced pain \"frequently\" or \"almost constantly.\" Pain among SNF residents can interfere with rehabilitation and has potential secon dary complications. The potential effects of pain on resident health are myriad , and it is critical to assess pain during hospitalization and after discharge. Assessing pain in in SNF residents during their stay can lead to appropriate treatment and improved quality of life, red uce complications associated with immobility such as skin breakdown and infection, and facilitate rehabilitation efforts and returning to community settings. Pain assessment post -discharge can also be used to plan appropriate treatment and may reduce readm issions. Data Elements for Assessment of Pain Interference J0510.

Rarely or not at all 2. Occasionally 3. Frequently 4. Almost constantly 8. Unable to answer Current use Data elements on the topic of pain are currently assessed in OASIS and MDS. The OASIS assesses the frequency of pain interfering with patient's activity or movement. A pain assessment interview is included in MDS and has questions on whether pain has made it hard for the resident to sleep at night and whether pain has limited day -to-day activities. Prior evidence supporting use of Pain Interference data elements Two interview -based data elements, pain effect on sleep and pain effect on activities, were included in the PAC PRD testing of IRR and showed strong IRR (weighted kappas of 0.836 and 0.789, respectively).197 In a national test to develop and validate the MDS 3.0, two items (pain made it hard to sleep, pain limited day -to-day activities) were validated for measuring the effect of pain on function.198 Evidence supporting use of Pain from the National Beta Test Assessing Pain: In the National Beta Test, three pain interference data elements were assessed : Effect of Pain on Sleep, Pain Interference with Rehabilitation Therapies (If Applicable), and Pain Interference with Daily Activities. A total of 489 patients/residents in HHA s, 618 in IRFs, 375 in LTCHs, and 872 in SNFs (n=2,354 overall) reported experiencing any pain and were administered the three pain interfere nce items. Setting -specific frequencies are shown in Appendix C, Table 7.1.1. Across settings, among the 78 percent of patients/residents who reported experiencing any pain, pain interfered with sleep more often than \"rarely \" for two of three patients/res idents (65 percent); 37 percent of patients/residents with pain had pain that made it difficult to sleep \"frequently\" or \"almost constantly.\" In the SNF setting, among the 78 percent of residen ts who reported experiencing any pain, pain interfered with sle ep more than \"rarely \" for about two of three patients (63 percent); 36 percent of patients with pain in the SNF experienced pain that interfered with sleep \"frequently\" or \"almost constantly.\" Among the patients/residents who reported experiencing any pain , most had been offered rehabilitation therapies (e.g., physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy), both across settings (89 percent) and in the SNF (93 percent). A cross settings, among these patients/residents, 73 percent of these patients re ported that pain rarely interfered with rehabilitation. Within the SNF setting, 73 percent reported that pain \" rarely \" interfered with rehabilitation; about one in nine (11 percent) of SNF patients 197 Gage, B., Smith, L., Ross, J., Coots, L., Kline, T., Shamsuddin, K., ... & Gage -Croll, Z.

Retrieved 2008a. 81 who had pain and were offered therapy had pain that interfered with therapy \"frequently\" or \"almost constantly.\" Across settings, among those who reported experiencing any pain, 55 percent of patients/residents reported pain limiting their daily activities (not including rehabilitation) more often than \"rarely or not at all.\" About one in three of these patients/residents (33 percent) had pain that limited activities \"frequently\" or \"almost constantly.\" In the SNF setting, 59 percent of patients with pain had pain that interfered more often than \" rarely. \" About one in three SNF patients with pain (33 percent) had pain that limited activities \"frequently\" or \"almost constantly .\" Missing data: Overall, there were low rates of missing data for pain data elements. Across all settings, missing data did not exceed 2.4 pe rcent for any data element. Similarly, in the SNF setting, missing data did not exceed 2.5 percent for any data elemen t. In general, the low rate of missing data indicates feasibility of administration. Time to complete: The length of time to administer th e pain data elements was examined as another indicator of feasibility among 440 patients/residents in HHAs, 533 in IRFs, 321 in LTCHs, and 483 in SNFs (n =1,777 overall). Across settings, the average time to complete the three interference items was 1.3 minutes (SD =0.6). In the SNF setting, time to complete was similar , at 1.3 minutes (SD=0.5). Interrater reliability: IRR was assessed for 197 patient s/residents in HHAs, 256 in IRFs, 232 in LTCHs, and 268 in SNFs (n=953 overall). IRR statistics were generally excellent/perfect, indicating high levels of agreement in responses to the data elements across assessment s taff. For the pain interference dat a elements across settings, kappas were excellent/almost perfect, with values of either 0.97 or 0.98. The same was true in the SNF setting, where excellent/almost perfect kappas ranged from 0.97 to 0.99. Percent agreement was similarly high, with 98 percen t agreement for all items across settings and from 99 to 100 percent in the SNF setting . More -detailed IRR statistics are shown in Appendix C, Table 7.1.2. 82 Section 5: Impairments Hearing and Vision Impairments Hearing and vision impairments are common co nditions that, if unaddressed, affect patients' and residents' activities of daily living, communication, physical functioning, rehabilitation outcomes, and overall quality of life. Sensory limitations can lead to confusion in new settings, increase isolation, contribute to mood disorders, and impede accurate assessment of other medical conditions, such as cognition. Hearing impairments may cause difficulty in communication of important information concerning the patient's or resident's condition, preferenc es, and care transitions; vision impairments have been associated with increased risk of falls. Both types of impairment can also interfere with comprehension of and adherence to discharge plan s. Onset of hearing and vision impairments can be gradual, so a ccurate screening tools and follow-up evaluations are essential to determining which patients and residents need hearing- or vision- specific medical attention or assistive devices, and to ensur ing that person -directed care plans are developed to accommodate patient s' and resident s' needs during PAC and at discharge. Assessments pertaining to sensory status aid PAC providers in understanding the needs of their patients and residents by establish ing a diagnosis of hearing or vision impairment, elucidating th e patients' and residents ' ability and willingness to participate in treatments or use assistive devices during their stay s, and identifying appropriate ongoing therapy and support needs at the time of discharge. The standardized assessment of vision impai rment among PAC patients and residents supports clinical decision making, early clinical intervention, person -centered care, and improved care continuity and coordination. The use of valid and reliable standardized assessments can aid in the communication of information within and across providers, further enabling the transfer of accurate health information. Standardized Data Elements to Assess Hearing and Vision Impairments CMS has identified two data elements for cross- setting standardized assessment of hearing and vision impairment. 1. Hearing 2. Vision Hearing Hearing impairment is one of the most common complaints in adults over the age of 60 and is a major contributor to difficulties in spee ch comprehension.199 Causes of hearing loss can include noise, earwax or fluid buildup, a punctured ear drum, viruses and bacteria, certain health conditions (e.g., stroke, cardiac conditions, and brain injury), medications, heredity, and aging.200 Age -related hearing loss is caused by presbycusis and occurs gradually ove r time as an individual ages. It is typically hereditary and usually affects both ears. Hearing impairment in older adults has been associated with a myriad of 199 Peelle, J. E., Troiani, V., Grossman, M., & Wingfield, A. (2011).

Hearing Loss: A common problem for older adults. Retrieved from emotional vitality,206 and various medical conditions (e.g., arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, emphysema, high blood pressure, and stroke).207 A high proportion of older adults receiving services in a PAC setting experience hearing impairment. About 51 percent of nursing facility patients and residents are estimated to have moderate to severe hearing impairment. 208 Data from the PAC PRD suggest that severe hearing impairment affects 1 to 2 percent of Medi care FFS beneficiaries in the four types of PAC.209 Among older adults more generally, reports on the prevalence of hearing loss vary. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders has stated that one-third of people between ages 65 and 74 have hearing loss and roughly half of those older than 75 are hearing -impaired.210 Additionally, a study found that two- thirds of individuals aged 70 years or older have bilateral hearing loss and approximately three- quarters have hearing loss in at least one ear.211 Assessing hearing impairment is critical to improv ing patient outcomes, safety, and quality of life. In addition, assessment can inform future care planning and care transitions. Relevance to SNFs Inadequate hearing is common among residents in SNFs. According to a study on hearing loss, 51 percent of nur sing home residents had a moderate to severe loss.212 The assessment of hearing allows SNFs the opportunity to treat these impairments or improve the ability to hear (e.g., with devices), supporting better outcomes. Problems with hearing can contribute to sensory deprivation, social isolation, 201 Contrera, K. J., Wallhagen , M. I., Mamo, S. K., Oh, E. S., & Lin, F. R. (2016).

Data Element for the Assessment of Impairments: Hearing B0200. Hearing Enter Code Ability to hear (with hearing aid or hearing appliances if normally used) 0. Adequate - no difficulty in normal conversation, social interaction, listening to TV 1. Minimal difficulty - difficulty in some environments (e.g., when person speaks softly or setting is noisy) 2. Moderate diffic ulty - speaker has to increase volume and speak distinctly 3. Highly im paired - absence of useful hearing Current use The Hearing data element is currently collected in the MDS, and is assessed with the use of a hearing aid, if applicable. Prior evidence supporting use of Hearing The Hearing data element tested in the PAC PRD includes one question regarding hearing ability, which showed high reliability across PAC settings (unweighted kappa =0.78). The MDS 3.0 version of the Hearing data element also had almost perfect agreement in the MDS 3.0 national test in nursing homes (weighted kappas =0.94 and 0.89).215 Evidence supporting use of Hearing from the National Beta Test Assessing Hearing: In the National Beta Test, a Hearing assessment item was administered to 643 patients/residents in HHAs, 783 in IRFs, 498 in LTCHs, and 1, 141 in SNF s (n=3,065 overall). Overall, 74 percent of patients/residents had adequate hearing, 17 percent h ad minimal difficulty hearing, 8 percent had moderate difficulty hearing, and 1 percent were highly impaired. In the SNF setting, 76 percent of patients had adequate hearing, 15 percent had minimal difficulty hearing, 8 percent had moderate difficulty hear ing, and 1 percent were highly impaired. See Appendix C, Table 8.1.1, for setting -specific response frequencies for the Hearing data element. Missing data: There were very low rates of missing responses for the Hearing data element both overall (0.3 percen t) and in the SNF setting ( 0.3 percent ), indicating feasibility of administration. 213 Cacciatore, F., Napoli, C., Abete, P., Ma rciano, E., Triassi, M., & Rengo, F.

Across all settings and in the SNF setting specifically, the mean time to complete the Hearing item was 0.3 minutes (SD =0.2 minutes). Interrater reliability: IRR wa s assessed for the Hearing item for 197 patients/residents in HHAs, 258 in IRFs, 237 in LTCHs, and 268 in SNFs (n=960 overall). Across all settings, kappa for the Hearing item was substantial/good (0.65). In the SNF setting, kappa for the Hearing item al so was substantial/good ( 0.62). Percent agreement was high for the Hearing item across settings (84 percent ) and in the SNF setting ( 83 percent ). More -detailed IRR statistics are shown in Appendix C, Table 8.1.2. Vision Visual impairment can be caused by n ot only age -related diseases (e.g., age- related macular degeneration, cataract s, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy) but also nearsightedness, farsightedness, loss of near vision with age, and/or untreated disease.216 In addition to conditions affecting the eye itself, visual deficits can be caused by other conditions, such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. Visu al impairment in older adults has been associated with depression and anxiety,217 lower cognitive function,218 and poorer quality of life.219 The PAC PR D study found that between 1 and 3 percent of Medicare FFS beneficiaries among the four types of PAC providers had the most extreme category of visual impairment assessed, \"No vision or object identification questionable.\" 220 Although most patients and resi dents in the PAC settings do not exhibit severely impaired vision, visual impairment affects a substantial pro portion of older adults and is predicted to increase substantially over time. A study examining visual impairment among adults in the United State s found that in 2015, among the 3.22 million persons in the United States who were visually impaired, the larg est proportions comprised those in older age categories: 80 years of age and older (50 percent), 70-79 years (24 percent), and 60-69 years (16 per cent).221 By 2050, the proportion of adults with visual impairment will increase to 64 percent among individuals aged 80 years and older.222 Assessing visual impairment is critical to improving patient outcomes, safety, and quality of life. Additionally, assessment can inform future care planning and care transitions. 216 Cimarolli, V. R., Boerner, K., Brennan -Ing, M., Reinhardt, J. P., & Horowitz, A. (2012).

Among nursing home residents, two studies have found 38 and 57 percent of residents experience visual impairment,223 224 The assessm ent of vision allows SNFs the opportunity to address these impairments or improve the ability to se e, supporting better outcomes. Additionally, assessment of this information is useful for ensuring safety in the SNF setting, as impaired vision increases th e risk of falls.225 If uncorrected, vision impairment can limit the enjoyment of everyday activities such as reading newspapers, books or correspondence, and maintaining and enjoying hobbies and other activities. The standardized assessment of vision in a resident would provide important information for patient safety, communication, care planning, care t ransitions, and resource use in SNFs. Data Element for the Assessment of Impairments: Vision B1000. Vision Enter Code Ability to see in adequate light (with glasses or other visual appliances) 0. Adequate - sees fine detail, such as regular print in newspapers/books 1. Impaired - sees large print, but not regular print in newspapers/books 2. Moderately impaired - limited vision; not able to see newspaper headlines but can identify objects 3. Highly impaired - object identification in question, but eyes appear to follow objects 4. Severely impaired - no vision or sees only light, colors or shapes; eyes do not app ear to follow objects Current use Vision i s currently assessed in the OASIS and MDS, with corrective lenses when applicable. Vision is assessed in OASIS with three response options ranging from 0 (normal vision) to 2 (severely impaired). The Vision data element (Ability to See in Adequate Light) in the MDS contains five response options ranging from 0 (adequate) to 4 (severely impaired). Prior evidence supporting use of Vision The MDS 3.0 Vision data element has been shown to perform reliably in screening for vision impairment (weighted kappa =0.917) in the national MDS 3.0 test in nursing homes.226 The Vision data element is also linked to performance with readily available materials (i.e., newspaper). In addition, the Vision data element was tested in t he PAC PRD assessment. The PAC PRD found subs tantial agreement for IRR across settings for this data element (kappa of 0.74).227 223 Owlsey, C., McGwin, G., Scilley, K., Meek, G. C., Dyer, A., Seker, D. (2007).

More - detailed IRR statistics are shown in Appendix C, Table 9.2.2. 88 Section 6: New Categor y: Social Determinants of Health Standardized Data Elements to Assess for Social Determinants of Health CMS has identified data elements for cross- setting standardization of assessment for seven social determinants of health (SDOH). The data elements are as follows: 1. Race 2. Ethnicity 3. Preferred Language 4. Interpreter Service s 5. Health Literacy 6. Transportation 7. Social Isolation Race and Ethnicity Relevance to SNFs The persistence of racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care is widely documented, including in PAC settings. 228 Although racial and ethnic disparities decrease when social factors are controlled for, they often remain. The root causes of these disparities are not always clear because data on many SDOH are not collected. Measuring SDOH in SNF settings is an important step to addressing these avoidable differences in health outcomes. Collecting data on race and ethnicity supports patient- centered care and informs understanding of patient complexity and risk factors that may affect payment, quality measurement, and care outcomes for SNFs . Improving how race and ethnicity data are collected is an important component of improving quality by identifying and addressing health disparities that affect Medicare beneficiaries. 228 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

The data element consists of a single question, which aligns with the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) minimum data standards for federal data collection efforts.229 The 1997 OMB Standard li sts five minimum categories of race: (1) American Indian or Alaska Native, (2) Asian, (3) 229 Office of Management and Budget. (1997, October 30). Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity (Notice of Decision ). Federal Register -30/pdf/97- 28653.pdf 90 Black or African American, (4) Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and (5) White. The 1997 OMB Standard also lists two minimum categories of ethnicity: (1) His panic or Latino, and (2) Not Hispanic or Latino.230 The current version uses a \"Mark all that apply\" response option. Evidence supporting use of Race and Ethnicity The modification will result in two separate data elements, one for race and one for ethnicity, that will conform with the 2011 HHS Data Standards for person-level data collection and the 1997 OMB Standards. The 2011 HHS Data Standards permit the collection of more- detailed information on population groups provided additional categories can be aggr egated into the OMB minimum standard set of categories. The 2011 HHS Data Standards require a two -question format when self -identification is used to collect data on race and ethnicity. Large federal surveys, such as the National Health Interview Survey, t he Behavioral Risk Facto r Surveillance System, and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, have implemented the 2011 HHS Data Standards. CMS has similarly updated the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey, and the Hea lth Insurance Marketplace Application for Health Coverage with the 2011 HHS data standards. Preferred Language and Interpreter Services Relevance to SNFs More than 64 million people in the United States speak a language other than English at home, and nea rly 40 million of those individuals have limited English proficiency (LEP).231 Individuals with LEP have been shown to receive worse care and have poorer health outcomes, including higher readmission rates.232 Communication with individuals with LEP is an important component of quali ty health care, which starts by understanding the population in need of language services. Unaddressed language barriers between a patient and provider care team negatively affect the ability to identify and address individual medical and non- medical care needs, to convey and understand clinical information, and to convey and understand discharge and follow-up instructions, all of which are necessary for providing high- quality care. Understanding the communication assistance needs of residents and patients with LEP, including individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, is critical for ensuring good outcomes. 230 Ibid. 231 U.S. Census Bureau, 2013-2017 American Community Survey. https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_5YR_S1601&prodType=table 232 Karliner , L.

B .Do you need or want an interpreter to communicate with a doctor or health care staff? 0.No 1.Y es 9.Unable to determine C urrent use The preferred language of residents and patients and the need for interpreter services are assessed in two PAC assessment tools. The LCDS and the MDS use the same two data elements to assess preferred language and whether a patient or resident needs or wants an interpreter to communicate with health care staff. The current preferred language data element in LCDS and MDS is open -ended, allowing the patient or resident to identify their preferred language, including American Sign Language. The MDS initially implemented preferred language and interpreter services data elements to assess the needs of SNF residents and patients and inform care planning. For alignment purposes, the LCDS later adopted the same data elements for LTCHs. Evidence supporting use of Pr eferred Language and Interpreter Services The 2009 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report on standardizing data for health care quality improvement emphasizes that language and communication needs should be assessed as a standard part of health care delivery and quality improvement strategies. 233 Although the 2011 HHS Primary Language Data Standard recommends a two -part question to assess spoken language, the need to improve the assessment of language preferences and communication needs across PAC settings should be balanced with the provider and patient assessm ent burden. In addition, preferred spoken language would not allow information to be collected on American Sign Language, as is accounted for by the preferred language and interpreter services data elements currently in the MDS and LCDS. Health Literacy Relevance to SNFs Similar to language barriers, low health literacy can interfere with communication between the provider and resident or patient and the ability for resi dents and patients or their caregivers to understand and follow treatment plans, including medication management. Poor health literacy is linked to lower levels of knowledge about health, worse health outcomes, receipt of fewer preventive services, higher medical costs, and higher rates of emergency department use.234 233 Institute of Medicine .

Sometimes 3. Often 4. Always 8. Resident unable to respond Current use A health literacy data element is not currently used in any of the PAC assessment tools. Evidence supporting use of Health Literacy Health literacy is prioritized by Healthy People 2020 as an SDOH.235 NASEM' s 2016 report on accounting for social risk factors in Medicare payment considers health literacy an individual risk factor affected by other social risk factors.236 The Single Item Literacy Screener (SILS) question, which assesses reading ability (a primary component of health literacy), tested reasonably well against the 36 -item Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S -TOFHLA), a thoroughly vetted and widely adopted health literacy test, in assessing the likelihood of low health literacy in an adult sample from primary care practices participating in the Vermont Diabetes Information System .237 SILS is publicly available, and shorter and easier to administer than the S-TOFHLA. Research found that a positive result on the SILS demonstrates an increased likelihood that an individual has low health literacy.238 Transportation Relevance to SNFs Transportation barriers commonly affect access to needed health care, causing missed appointments, delayed care, and unfilled prescriptions, all of which can have a negative impact on health outcomes.239 Access to transportation for ongoing health care and medication access needs, particularly for those with chr onic diseases, is essential to successful chronic disease management. Adopting a data element to collect and analyze information regarding transportation needs across PAC settings will facilitate the connection to programs that can address identified needs. 235 Healthy People 2020.

Resident unable to respond Current use A transportation data element is not currently used in any of the PAC assessment tools. Evidence supporting use of Transportation The data element uses the Transportation item from the Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patient Assets, Risks, and Exper iences (PRAPARE) tool and is reflective of research on the importance of addressing transportation as a critical SDOH. The national PRAPARE SDOH assessment protocol is developed and owned by the National Association of Community Health Centers, in partners hip with the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organization, the Oregon Primary Care Association, and the Institute for Alternative Futures. More information about development of the PRAPARE tool can be found at http://www.nachc.org/prapare . Items in the assessment tool are consistent with Healthy People 2020 priorities and ICD-10 coding. 240 Social Isolation Relevance to SNFs Distinct from loneliness, social isolation refers to an actual or perceived lack of contact with other peopl e, such as living alone or residing in a remote area. 241 Social isolation tends to increase with age, is a risk factor fo r physical and mental illness, and is a predictor of mortality.242 PAC providers are well - suited to design and implement programs to incre ase social engagement of patients and residents while accounting for individual needs and preferences. Adopting a data e lement to collect and analyze information about social isolation in SNFs and across PAC settings would facilitate the identification of residents and patients who are socially isolated and who may benefit from engagement efforts. 240 National Association of Community Health C enters.
