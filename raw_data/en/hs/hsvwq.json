Reiki is a form of complementary and alternative medicine; there's evidence it can reduce daily stress and help with management of some chronic diseases. When the energy centers within our body are healthy and open, so are we physically, emotionally, and mentally in our relationships with ourselves and others. But when they are blocked or out of alignment, it can create physical and emotional imbalances which hold us back us from being our best selves. Reiki healing is a great choice if you're looking to alleviate stress, anxiety, emotional or physical pain. Or if you are looking to connect back to yourself and feel more alignment in your day-to-day life.
