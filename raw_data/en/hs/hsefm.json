Approved December 19, 2006. VerDate 14-DEC-2004 2022 Page 422U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES | PAGE 1Explaining Operation Warp Speed What's the goal? Operation Warp Speed's goal is to produce and deliver 300 million doses of safe and effective vaccines with the initial doses available by January 2021, as part of a broader strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics (collectively known as countermeasures). How will the goal be accomplished? By investing in and coordinating countermeasure development, OWS will allow countermeasures such as a vaccine to be delivered to patients more rapidly while adhering to standards for safety and efficacy. Who's working on Operation Warp Speed? OWS is a partnership among components of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and the Department of Defense (DoD). OWS engages with private firms and other federal agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs. It will coordinate existing HHS-wide efforts, including the NIH's Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) partnership, NIH's Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative, and work by BARDA. What's the plan and what's happened so far? DEVELOPMENT: To accelerate development while maintaining standards for safety and efficacy, OWS has been selecting the most promising countermeasure candidates and providing coordinated government support. Protocols for the demonstration of safety and efficacy are being aligned, which will allow these harmonized clinical trials to proceed more quickly, and the protocols for the trials will be overseen by the federal government (NIH), as opposed to traditional public-private partnerships, in which pharmaceutical companies decide on their own protocols. Rather than eliminating steps from traditional development timelines, steps will proceed simultaneously, such as starting manufacturing of vaccines and therapeutics at industrial scale well before the demonstration of efficacy and safety as happens normally. This increases the financial risk, but not the product risk. Picker, Platforms and Networks Spring 2022 Page 423Explaining Operation Warp SpeedU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES | PAGE 2Select actions to support OWS vaccine and therapeutic development so far include: March 30: HHS announced $456 million in funds for Johnson & Johnson's (Janssen) candidate vaccine. Phase 1 clinical trials began in Belgium on July 24th and in the U.S on July 27th. Janssen's large-scale Phase 3 clinical trial began on September 22, 2020, making them the fourth OWS candidate to enter Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States. Up to 60,000 volunteers will be enrolled in the trial at up to nearly 215 clinical research sites in the United States and internationally. April 16: HHS made up to $483 million in support available for Moderna's candidate vaccine, which began Phase 1 trials on March 16 and received a fast-track designation from FDA. This agreement was expanded on July 26 to include an additional $472 million to support late-stage clinical development, including the expanded Phase 3 study of the company's mRNA vaccine, which began on July 27th. May 21: HHS announced up to $1.2 billion in support for AstraZeneca's candidate vaccine, developed in conjunction with the University of Oxford. The agreement is to make available at least 300 million doses of the vaccine for the United States, with the first doses delivered as early as October 2020, if the product successfully receives FDA EUA or licensure. AstraZeneca's large-scale Phase 3 clinical trial began on August 31, 2020. July 7: HHS announced $450 million in funds to support the large-scale manufacturing of Regeneron's COVID-19 investigational anti-viral antibody treatment, REGN-COV2. This agreement is the first of a number of OWS awards to support potential therapeutics all the way through to manufacturing. As part of the manufacturing demonstration project, doses of the medicine will be packaged and ready to ship immediately if clinical trials are successful and FDA grants EUA or licensure. July 7: HHS announced $1.6 billion in funds to support the large-scale manufacturing of Novavax's vaccine candidate. By funding Novavax's manufacturing effort, the federal government will own the 100 million doses expected to result from the demonstration project. July 22: HHS announced up to $1.95 billion in funds to Pfizer for the large-scale manufacturing and nationwide distribution of 100 million doses of their vaccine candidate. The federal government will own the 100 million doses of vaccine initially produced as a result of this agreement, and Pfizer will deliver the doses in the United States if the product successfully receives FDA EUA or licensure, as outlined in FDA guidance , after completing demonstration of safety and efficacy in a large Phase 3 clinical trial, which began July 27th. July 31 : HHS announced approximately $2 billion in funds to support the advanced development, including clinical trials and large scale manufacturing, of Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) investigational adjuvanted vaccine. By funding the manufacturing effort, the federal government will own the approximately 100 million doses expected to result from the demonstration project. The adjuvanted vaccine doses could be used in clinical trials or, if the FDA authorizes use, as outlined in agency guidance, the doses would be distributed as part of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign. August 5: HHS announced approximately $1 billion in funds to support the large-scale manufacturing and delivery of Johnson & Johnson's (Janssen) investigational vaccine candidate. Under the terms of the agreement, the U.S. Government will own the resulting 100 million doses of vaccine, and will have the option to acquire more. The company's investigational vaccine relies on Janssen's recombinant adenovirus technology, AdVac, Picker, Platforms and Networks Spring 2022 Page 424Explaining Operation Warp SpeedU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES | PAGE 3a technology used to develop and manufacture Janssen's Ebola vaccine with BARDA support; that vaccine received European Commission approval and was used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda during the 2018- 2020 Ebola outbreak that began in the DRC. August 11: HHS announced up to $1.5 billion in funds to support the large-scale manufacturing and delivery of Moderna's investigational vaccine candidate. Under the terms of the agreement, the U.S. Government will own the resulting 100 million doses of vaccine, and will have the option to acquire more. The vaccine, called mRNA-1273, has been co-developed by Moderna and scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. NIAID has continued to support the vaccine's development including nonclinical studies and clinical trials. Additionally, BARDA has supported phase 2/3 clinical trials, vaccine manufacturing scale up and other development activities for this vaccine. The Phase 3 clinical trial, which began July 27, is the first government-funded Phase 3 clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. August 23: As part of the agency's efforts to combat COVID-19, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for investigational convalescent plasma. Based on available scientific evidence, the FDA determined convalescent plasma may be effective in lessening the severity or shortening the length of COVID-19 illness in hospitalized patients, and that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks. The EUA authorizes the distribution of convalescent plasma in the U.S. as well as its administration by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Click here to learn more about EUAs. October 9: HHS announced an agreement with AstraZeneca for late-stage development and large-scale manufacturing of the company's COVID-19 investigational product AZD7442, a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies, that may help treat or prevent COVID-19. The goal of AstraZeneca's partnership with the U.S. Government is to develop a monoclonal antibody cocktail that can help prevent infection. An effective monoclonal antibody that can prevent COVID-19, particularly one that is long-lasting and delivered by intramuscular injection, may be of particular use in certain groups. This includes people who have compromised immune function, those who are over 80 years old, and people undergoing medical treatments that preclude them from receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. October 28: HHS announced a $375 million agreement with Eli Lilly and Company to purchase the first doses of the company's COVID-19 investigational antibody therapeutic bamlanivimab, also known as LY-CoV555. Bamlanivimab currently is being evaluated in Phase 3 clinical trials funded by Eli Lilly, in addition to clinical trials as part of the ACTIV public-private partnership. The FDA is reviewing bamlanivimab as a possible treatment for COVID-19 in outpatients. Monoclonal antibodies, which mimic the human immune system, bind to certain proteins of a virus, reducing the ability of the virus to infect human cells. November 10: HHS announced plans to allocate initial doses of Eli Lilly and Company's investigational monoclonal antibody therapeutic, bamlanivimab, which received emergency use authorization from the FDA on November 9, for the treatment of non- hospitalized patients with mild or moderate confirmed cases of COVID-19. A data-driven system will ensure continued fair and equitable distribution of these new products. Weekly allocations to state and territorial health departments will be proportionally Picker, Platforms and Networks Spring 2022 Page 425Explaining Operation Warp SpeedU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES | PAGE 4based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in each state and territory over the previous seven days, based on data hospitals and state health departments enter into the HHS Protect data collection platform. To find out how much bamlanivimab has been allocated to specific states, territories, and jurisdictions, visit the allocation dashboard. This dashboard will be updated each distribution week until the FDA issues a revised EUA indicating the U.S. government involvement in the allocation and distribution process is no longer needed. November 23: HHS announced plans to allocate initial doses of Regeneron's investigational monoclonal antibody therapeutic, casirivimab and imdevimab, which received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on November 21, 2020, for treatment of non-hospitalized patients with mild or moderate confirmed cases of COVID-19 at high risk of hospitalization. In July, the federal government announced federal funding to support large-scale manufacturing of the therapeutic with approximately 300,000 doses of the medicine expected to result from the project. HHS will allocate these government-owned doses equitably on a weekly basis to state and territorial health departments which, in turn, will determine which healthcare facilities receive the infusion drug. To find out how much of Regeneron's therapeutic has been allocated to specific states, territories, and jurisdictions, visit the allocation dashboard . This dashboard will be updated each distribution week until the FDA issues a revised EUA indicating the U.S. government involvement in the allocation and distribution process is no longer needed. As announced on May 15, the vaccine development plan is as follows, subject to change as work proceeds: Fourteen promising candidates have been chosen from the 100+ vaccine candidates currently in development\u2014some of them already in clinical trials with U.S. government support. The 14 vaccine candidates are being narrowed down to about seven candidates, representing the most promising candidates from a range of technology options (nucleic acid, viral vector, protein subunit), which will go through further testing in early-stage clinical trials. Large-scale randomized trials for the demonstration of safety and efficacy will proceed for the most promising candidates. MANUFACTURING: The federal government is making investments in the necessary manufacturing capacity at its own risk, giving firms the confidence to invest aggressively in development which will allow faster distribution of an eventual vaccine. Manufacturing capacity for selected candidates will be advanced while they are still in development, rather than scaled up after approval or authorization. Manufacturing capacity developed will be used for whatever vaccine is eventually successful, if possible given the nature of the successful product, regardless of which firms have developed the capacity. Select actions to support OWS manufacturing efforts so far include: The May 21, April 16, and March 30 HHS agreements with AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson respectively include investments in manufacturing capabilities. Picker, Platforms and Networks Spring 2022 Page 426Explaining Operation Warp SpeedU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES | PAGE 5 June 1: HHS announced a task order with Emergent BioSolutions to advance domestic manufacturing capabilities and capacity for a potential COVID-19 vaccine as well as therapeutics, worth approximately $628 million, using Emergent's BARDA-supported Center for Innovation in Advanced Department and Manufacturing. July 27: HHS announced a task order with Texas A&M University and FUJIFILM to advance domestic manufacturing capabilities and capacity for a potential COVID-19 vaccine, worth approximately $265 million, using another BARDA-supported CIADM. August 4 : Grand River Aseptic Manufacturing Inc., (GRAM) Grand Rapids, Michigan, was awarded a $160 million firm-fixed-price contract for domestic aseptic fill and finish manufacturing capacity for critical vaccines and therapeutics in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. October 13: HHS announced a $31 million agreement with Cytiva to expand the company's manufacturing capacity for products that are essential in producing COVID-19 vaccines, such as liquid and dry powder cell culture media, cell culture buffers, mixer bags, and XDR bioreactors. Cytiva is a major manufacturer of pharmaceutical consumables and hardware products and the primary supplier to many of the companies currently working with the U.S. government to develop COVID-19 vaccines. This capacity expansion will help Cytiva respond to the demand for COVID-19 vaccine consumables and hardware products without impacting on current manufacturing output. DISTRIBUTION: OWS and our private partners are developing a plan for delivering a safe and effective product to Americans as quickly and reliably as possible. Experts from HHS are leading vaccine development, while experts from DoD are partnering with the CDC and other parts of HHS to coordinate supply, production, and distribution of vaccines. Select actions to support OWS distribution efforts include: MAY: May 12 : DoD and HHS announced a $138 million contract with ApiJect for more than 100 million prefilled syringes for distribution across the United States by year-end 2020, as well as the development of manufacturing capacity for the ultimate production goal of over 500 million prefilled syringes in 2021. JUNE: June 9: HHS and DoD announced a joint effort to increase domestic manufacturing capacity for vials that may be needed for vaccines and treatments. June 11 : HHS announced $204 million in funds to Corning to expand the domestic manufacturing capacity to produce approximately 164 million Valor Glass vials per year if needed. Valor Glass provides chemical durability to minimize particulate contamination. The specialized glass allows for rapid filling and capping methods that can increase manufacturing throughput by as much as 50 percent compared with conventional filling lines, which in turn can reduce the overall manufacturing time for vaccines and therapies. June 11 : HHS announced $143 million to SiO2 Materials Science to ramp up capacity to produce the company's glass-coated plastic container, which can be used for drugs and vaccines. The new lines provide the capacity to produce an additional 120 million vials per year if needed. Picker, Platforms and Networks Spring 2022 Page 427Explaining Operation Warp SpeedU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES | PAGE 6AUGUST: August 14 : HHS and DoD announced that McKesson Corporation will be a central distributor of future COVID-19 vaccines and related supplies needed to administer the pandemic vaccinations. The CDC is executing an existing contract option with McKesson to support vaccine distribution. The company also distributed the H1N1 vaccine during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009- 2010. The current contract with McKesson, awarded as part of a competitive bidding process in 2016, includes an option for the distribution of vaccines in the event of a pandemic. Detailed planning is underway to ensure rapid distribution as soon as the FDA authorizes one or more vaccines. Once these decisions are made, McKesson will work under CDC's guidance to ship COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites. SEPTEMBER: September 16: HHS and DoD released two documents outlining the Trump Administration's detailed strategy to deliver safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine doses to the American people as quickly and reliably as possible. The documents, developed by HHS in coordination with DoD and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), provide a strategic distribution overview along with an interim playbook for state, tribal, territorial, and local public health programs and their partners on how to plan and operationalize a vaccination response to COVID-19 within their respective jurisdictions. OCTOBER: October 16: HHS and DoD announced agreements with CVS and Walgreens to provide and administer COVID-19 vaccines to residents of long-term care facilities (LTCF) nationwide with no out-of-pocket costs. Protecting especially vulnerable Americans has been a critical part of the Trump Administration's work to combat COVID-19, and LTCF residents may be part of the prioritized groups for initial COVID-19 vaccination efforts until there are enough doses available for every American who wishes to be vaccinated. The Pharmacy Partnership for Long- Term Care Program provides complete management of the COVID-19 vaccination process. This means LTCF residents and staff across the country will be able to safely and efficiently get vaccinated once vaccines are available and recommended for them, if they have not been previously vaccinated. It will also minimize the burden on LTCF sites and jurisdictional health departments of vaccine handling, administration, and fulfilling reporting requirements. NOVEMBER: November 12: HHS and DoD announced partnerships with large chain pharmacies and networks that represent independent pharmacies and regional chains. Through the partnership with pharmacy chains, this program covers approximately 60 percent of pharmacies throughout the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Through the partnerships with network administrators, independent pharmacies and regional chains will also be part of the federal pharmacy program, further increasing access to vaccine across the country\u2014particularly in traditionally underserved areas. Picker, Platforms and Networks Spring 2022 Page 428Explaining Operation Warp SpeedU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES | PAGE 7Who's leading Operation Warp Speed? HHS Secretary Alex Azar and Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller oversee OWS, with Dr. Moncef Slaoui designated as chief advisor and General Gustave F. Perna confirmed as the chief operating officer. To allow these OWS leaders to focus on operational work, in the near future the program will be announcing separate points of contact, with deep expertise and involvement in the program, for communication with Congress and the public. What are you doing to make these products affordable for Americans? The Administration is committed to providing free or low-cost COVID-19 countermeasures to the American people as fast as possible. Any vaccine or therapeutic doses purchased with US taxpayer dollars will be given to the American people at no cost. How is Operation Warp Speed being funded? Congress has directed almost $10 billion to this effort through supplemental funding, including the CARES Act. Congress has also appropriated other flexible funding. The almost $10 billion specifically directed includes more than $6.5 billion designated for countermeasure development through BARDA and $3 billion for NIH research.

VerDate Sep 11 2014 Spring 2022 Page 440Picker, Platforms and Networks, Spring 2022 Page 441 FACT SHEET: The Biden-Harris Electric Vehicle Charging Ac- tion Plan December 13, 2021 Vice President Kamala Harris to Announce Action Plan that Fast Tracks Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Investments President Biden has united automakers and autoworkers to drive American leader- ship forward on clean cars, and he set an ambitious target of 50% of electric vehicle (EV) sale shares in the U.S. by 2030. No w, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will su- percharge America's efforts to lead the el ectric future, Building a Better America where we can strengthen domestic supply chains, outcompete the world, and make electric cars cheaper for working families. President Biden, American families, automakers, and autoworkers agree: the future of transportation is electric. The electric car future is cleaner, more equitable, more affordable, and an economic opportunity to support good-paying, union jobs across American supply chains as automakers cont inue investing in manufacturing clean ve- hicles and the batteries that power them. Today, the Biden-Harris-Administration is releasing an EV Charging Action Plan to outline steps federal agencies are taking to support developing and deploying chargers in American communities across the country. As a result of the Bipartisan Infrastruc-ture Law, the Department of Energy (DOE) and Department of Transportation (DOT) will establish a Joint Office of Ener gy and Transportation focused on deploy- ing EV infrastructure, working hand-in-hand to collect input and guidance from in-dustry leaders, manufacturers, workers, and other stakeholders that will ensure the na-tional network provides convenient charging for all. The initial focus will be building a convenient, reliable public charging network that can build public confidence, with a focus on filling gaps in rural, disadvantaged, and hard-to-reach locations. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the most transformative investment in electric vehicle charging in U.S. history that will put us on the path to a convenient and equitable network of 500,000 chargers and make EVs accessible to all Americas for both local and long-distance trips. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $5 billion in formula funding for states with a goal to build a national charging network. 10% is set-aside each year for the Secretary to provide grants to States to help fill gaps in the network. The Law also provides $2.5 billion for communities and corridors through a competitive grant program that will support innovative approaches and en- sure that charger deployment meets Administ ration priorities such as supporting rural charging, improving local air quality and incr easing EV charging access in disadvan- taged communities. Together, this is the larg est-ever U.S. investment in EV charging and will be a transformative down payment on the transition to a zero-emission future. With the historic investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Biden-Harris Administration is laying the foundation for a nationwide network of EV charging in- frastructure to provide a reliable, affordable, convenient, seamless user experience that is equitable and accessible for all Americans. This network will enable: An accelerated adoption of electric vehi cles for all private consumers and com- mercial fleets, including those who cannot reliably charge at their home that Picker, Platforms and Networks Spring 2022 Page 441Picker, Platforms and Networks, Spring 2022 Page 442 can improve our air quality, reduce emissions, put us on a path to net-zero emissions by no later than 2050, and position U.S. industries to lead global ef-forts. Targeted equity benefits for disadvantaged communities, reducing mobility and energy burdens while also creating jobs and supporting businesses. Create family-sustaining union jobs that can't be outsourced. Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing the following actions: Establishing a Joint Office of Energy and Transportation : Tomorrow, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm an d Transportation Secretary Pete Butti- gieg will sign an agreement enabling them to leverage the best resources, talent, and experience at the DOT and the DOE, including the DOE's National Labs. The Joint Office will ensure the agencies can work together to implement the EV charging network and other electrification provisions in the Bipartisan In-frastructure Law. This will provide states, communities, industry, labor, and consumer groups with a coordinated Fe deral approach and a \"one-stop-shop\" for resources on EV Charging and related topics. The agencies will complete a Memorandum of Understanding on December 14th to formally launch the Joint Office. Gathering Diverse Stakeholder Input : The White House is convening a se- ries of initial stakeholder meetings on t opics including partnerships with state and local government, domestic manufacturing, equity and environmental jus-tice, civil rights, partnering with trib al communities, and maximizing environ- mental benefits. DOT and DOE will also launch a new Advisory Committee on Electric Vehicles and is targeting to appoint members to this committee by the end of the first quarter of 2022. DO T released an updated guide to deploy- ing EV Charging in highway right-of-way in response to stakeholder interest. To gather input from the widest possible array of stakeholders, DOT has a new EV Charging Request for Informat ion, where stakeholders can submit their priorities for Federal standards and guidance for consideration. Preparing to Issue Guidance and Standards for States and Cities: The Admin-istration is already hard at work developing the guidance and standards de-scribed in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. No later than February 11th, DOT will publish guidance for States and cities to strategically deploy EV charging stations to build out a national network along our nation's highway system. This guidance will look at wh ere we already have EV charging and where we need\u2014or will need\u2014more of it. It will focus on the needs of disad- vantaged and rural communities, catalyze further private investment in EV charging, and ensure we're smartly conn ecting to our electric grid. No later than May 13th, DOT will publish standards for EV chargers in the national network to ensure they work, they're safe, and they're accessible to everyone. Requesting Information from Domestic Manufacturers : EV charger man- ufacturing, assembly, installation, and ma intenance all have the potential to not only support our sustainability and climate goals, but also to drive domestic competitiveness and create good-paying, union jobs in the United States. To ensure this network of EV chargers can be built in America, by America, DOT Picker, Platforms and Networks Spring 2022 Page 442Picker, Platforms and Networks, Spring 2022 Page 443 and DOE are working directly with manufacturers, automakers and labor to understand what domestic sourcing is available today, and what may be possi- ble in the future. In November, DOT and DOE released a request for infor-mation from domestic manufacturers to identify EV chargers and other charg-ing related components that meet US DOT Buy America requirements and to highlight the benefits of shifting all manufacturing and assembly processes to the United States. New Solicitation for Alternative Fuel Corridors : Today, the DOT is an- nouncing a forthcoming solicitation for the 6th round of Alternative Fuel Cor-ridors designations. This program, created by the FAST Act in 2015, recog-nizes highway segments that have infrastructure plans to allow travel on alter-native fuels, including electricity. FHWA will establish a recurring process to regularly update these corridors. The current network of over 100,000 public chargers operates with different plug types, payment options, data availability, an d hardware hookups. Today's actions will establish a more uniform approach, provid e greater convenience for customers, and offer increased confidence for industry. Th ese federal programs will spur additional private sector investments and drive the bu ild-out of a user-friendly, cost-effective, and financially sustainable national network creating well-paying jobs across manufac- turing, installation, and operation. A ubiquitous charging infrastructure targeted to meet different consumers' needs will provide equitable benefits to all Americans and provide flexibility for future investments, effective integration with a clean power sys- tem, and support a growing and diversif ying fleet of electrified vehicles. Electric Vehicle Batteries Another key component of our electric vehicle strategy is to increase domestic man- ufacturing of EV batteries and components and advance environmentally responsible domestic sourcing and recycling of critical minerals. In June, the Biden-Harris Administration released 100-day reviews of the supply chains of four critical products, including high-capacity batteries and critical minerals and materials. The reviews made dozens of recommendations across Federal agencies securing a reliable and sustainable end-to-end domestic supply chain for advanced bat-teries. These recommendations include supporting sustainable and responsible domes-tic mining and processing of key battery mi nerals, such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel, and ensuring new domestic automotive batter y production adheres to high-road labor standards. The Federal Consortium for Advanced Batteries released the National Blueprint for Lithium Batteries , codifying the findings of the battery supply chain review in a 10-year, whole-of-governm ent plan to urgently develop a domestic lithium battery supply chain that combats the clim ate crisis by creating good-paying clean energy jobs across America. The DOE Loan Programs Office (LPO) published new guidance and a fact sheet for the approximately $17 billion in loan authority in the Advanced Tech- nology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM) to support the domes-tic battery supply chain. LPO will levera ge full statutory authority to finance key strategic areas of development and f ill deficits in the domestic supply chain capacity. This will include the ATVM program making loans to manufacturers Picker, Platforms and Networks Spring 2022 Page 443Picker, Platforms and Networks, Spring 2022 Page 444 of advanced technology vehicle battery cells and packs for re-equipping, ex- panding or establishing such manufacturing facilities in the United States. DOE's Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) launched a new effort to support deployment of energy storage projects by federal agencies, including a federal government-wide energy storag e review that will evaluate the current opportunity for deploying battery storage at federal sites and a call for projects from federal sites interested in deploying energy storage projects. These actions build on steps taken earlier this year to leverage $13 million in FEMP's Assist- ing Federal Facilities with Energy Conser vation Technologies grants to unlock an estimated $260 million or more in project investments, including battery storage projects. There are already promising signs that the Administration strategy is working and industry is ready to step up. For example, Lithium is a critical input to batteries where the United States currently has very little domestic supply. The Biden Administration has funded two dozen teams to expand sour cing of lithium from geothermal brines and approved a permit for the Nevada-bas ed Thacker Pass lithium mine. Automakers area also signing contracts that leverage do mestic supply, including Ford sourcing lith- ium from recycled content through Redwood Materials, GM sourcing lithium from geothermal brines in the Salton Sea with Controlled Thermal Resources, and Tesla sourcing lithium from a Piedmont project in North Carolina. The investments proposed by the Biden Ad ministration will accelerate and amplify this progress. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes more than $7 billion in fund- ing to accelerate innovations and facilitie s across the battery supply chain from battery materials refining, processing and manufa cturing to battery manufacturing, including components, to battery recycling and reuse. These investments will support the devel- opment of a North American battery supply chain, help expand manufacturing and recycling facilities in the United States and substantially advance the battery recycling through research, development and demonstration projects in collaboration with re-tailers as well as state and local governments. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes: $3 billion in competitive grants for battery minerals and refined materials aimed at accelerating the developmen t of the North American battery supply chain. An additional $3 billion for competitive grants aimed at building, retooling, or expanding manufacturing of batteries and battery components (such as cath-odes, anodes, and electrolytes), and to establish recycling facilities in the United States. Recognizing the need for innovative and practical approaches to battery and critical mineral recycling, the act includes research, development, and demon-stration recycling projects ($60 million) and efforts in cooperation with retailers ($15 million) and state and local governments ($50 million) to increase the col-lection of spent batteries for reuse, recyc ling or proper disposal. The electric drive vehicle battery recycling and second -life applications program ($200 mil- lion) is focused on making electric vehicles batteries (e.g., optimized designs) easier to recycle and utilize in secondary applications before recycling.

President Biden, USDOT and USDOE Announce $5 Billion over Five Years for National EV Chargi ng Network, Made Possible by Bipartisan Infrastructure Law February 10, 2022 Joint Energy and Transportation Office and DriveElectric.gov Available to Assist States with Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plans FHWA 05-22 WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Departme nts of Transportation and Energy to- day announced nearly $5 billion that will be made available under the new National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Fo rmula Program established by President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to bu ild out a national electric vehicle charging network, an important step towards making electric vehicle (EV) charging accessible to all Americans. The program will provide nearly $5 billion ov er five years to help states create a network of EV charging stations along designated Alternative Fuel Corridors, partic-ularly along the Interstate Highway System. The total amount available to states in Fiscal Year 2022 under the NEVI Formula Program is $615 milli on. States must sub- mit an EV Infrastructure Deployment Plan before they can access these funds. A sec- ond, competitive grant program designed to further increase EV charging access in locations throughout the country, includin g in rural and underserved communities, will be announced later this year. \"A century ago, America ushered in the modern automotive era; now America must lead the electric vehicle revolution,\" said U.S. Transportation Secr etary Pete Buttigieg. \"The President's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help us win the EV race by work- ing with states, labor, and the private sector to deploy a historic nationwide charging network that will make EV charging accessible for more Americans.\" \"We are modernizing America's national highway system for drivers in cities large and small, towns and rural communities, to ta ke advantage of the benefits of driving electric,\" said U.S. Secretary of Energy Je nnifer M. Granholm. \"The Bipartisan Infra- structure Law is helping states to make el ectric vehicle charging more accessible by building the necessary infrastructure for dr ivers across America to save money and go the distance, from coast-to-coast.\" Today's news follows President Biden's announcement earlier this week on EV man- ufacturing, and the White House Fact Sheet on actions taken to date to prepare for this historic EV investment. To access these new Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds - and to help ensure a convenient, reliable, affordable, and equitable charging experience for all users - each state is required to submit an EV Infrastructure Deployment Plan to the new Joint Office of Energy and Transportation that describes how the state intends to use its Picker, Platforms and Networks Spring 2022 Page 445Picker, Platforms and Networks, Spring 2022 Page 446 share of NEVI Formula Program funds cons istent with Federal Highway Administra- tion (FHWA) guidance. These plans are expected to build on Alternative Fuel Corridors that nearly every state has designated over the past six years of this program. These corridors will be the spine of the new national EV charging netwo rk. The Joint Office will play a key role in the implementation of the NEVI Formula Program by providing direct technical assistance and support to help states develop their plans before they are reviewed and approved by the Federal Highway Administration, which administers the funding. \"Americans need to know that they can pu rchase an electric vehicle and find con- venient charging stations when they are using Interstates and other major highways,\" Deputy Federal Highway Administrator Stepha nie Pollack said. \"The new EV formula program will provide states with the resour ces they need to provide their residents with reliable access to an EV ch arging station as they travel.\" The new Joint Office of Energy and Transportation also launched a new website this week at DriveElectric.gov . There, officials can find links to technical assistance, data and tools for states, and careers. To join the Joint Office and support a future where everyone can ride and drive el ectric, individuals are encouraged to apply to be an EV charging fellow. As part of today's announcement, FHWA released the NEVI Formula Program funding to states that will be available following approval of state plans for Fiscal Year 2022 in addition to the Program Guidance and a Request for Nominations for states to expand their existing Alternative Fuel Corridors.

Microsoft Corp. 373 F.3d 1199 (D.C. Cir. 2004) GINSBURG, Chief Judge: In United States v. Microsoft Corp. , 253 F.3d 34 (D.C. Cir. 2001) ( Microsoft III), we affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment of the dis- trict court holding Microsoft had violated \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, vacated the associated remedial order, and directed the district court, on the basis of further proceedings, to devise a remedy \"ta ilored to fit the wrong creating the occa- sion\" therefor, id. at 107, 118-19. On remand, the United States and certain of the plaintiff states entered into a settlement ag reement with Microsoft. Pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties (Tunney) A ct, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 16(b)-(h), the district court held the parties' proposed consent decree, as amended to allow the court to act sua sponte to enforce the decree, was in \"the public interest.\" Meanwhile, the Common- wealth of Massachusetts and several other plai ntiff states refused to settle with Mi- crosoft and instead litigated to judgment a separate remedial decree. The judgment entered by the district court in their case cl osely parallels the consent decree negotiated by the United States. Massachusetts alone appeals the district court's entry of that decree. *** A. Remedial Proposals Massachusetts objects to several provisions th e district court included in the remedial decree. The Commonwealth also appeals the district court's refusal to adopt certain other provisions proposed by the States. 1. Commingling In Microsoft III we upheld the district court's finding that Microsoft's integration of IE and the Windows operating system generally \"prevented OEMs from pre-installing other browsers and deterred consumers from using them.\" 253 F.3d at 63-64 . Because they could not remove IE, installing anot her browser meant the OEM would incur the costs of supporting two browsers. Id. at 64. *** Accordingly, the district court instead approved the proposed requirement that Microsoft \"permi t OEMs to remove end-user access to aspects of the Window s operating system which perform middle- ware functionality.\" States' Remedy, at 159. Specifically, \u00a7 III.H of the decree requires Microsoft to \"[a]llow end users ... and OEMs ... to enable or remove access to each Microsoft Middleware Product or No n-Microsoft Middleware Product....\" Id. at 270. *** The district court's decision to fashion a re medy directed at the effect of Microsoft's commingling, rather than to prohibit comming ling, was within its discretion. *** The district court fashioned a remedy aimed at reducing the costs an OEM might face in having to support multiple internet browsers. The court thereby addressed itself to Microsoft's efforts to reduce software devel opers' interest in writing to the Application Program Interfaces (APIs) exposed by any operating system other than Windows. Far from abusing its discretion, therefore, the district court, by remedying the anticompet-itive effect of commingling, went to the heart of the problem Microsoft had created, and it did so without intruding itself into the design and engineering of the Windows operating system. We say, Well done! But soft! Massachusetts and the amici claim the district court nonetheless erred in rejecting a \"code removal\" remedy for Micr osoft's commingling, principally insofar as the court was concerned with \"Microsoft's ability to provide a consistent API set,\" Picker, Platforms and Networks Spring 2022 Page 466Picker, Platforms and Networks, Spring 2022 Page 467 which Microsoft referred to as the problem of Windows' \"fragmentation.\" They argue that any effort to keep software develope rs writing to Microsoft's APIs\u2014and thereby avoiding \"fragmentation\"\u2014is not procomp etitive but rather \"an argument against competition.\" *** Letting a thousand flowers bloom is usually a good idea, but here the court found evidence, as discussed above, that such dr astic fragmentation would likely harm con- sumers. Although it is almost certainly true, as both Massachusetts and the amici claim, that such fragmentation would also pose a thre at to Microsoft's ability to keep software developers focused upon its APIs, addressing the applications barrier to entry in a manner likely to harm consumers is not self-evidently an appropriate way to remedy an antitrust violation. The district court's end-user access provis ion fosters competition by opening the channels of distribution to non-Microsoft middleware. It was Microsoft's foreclosure of those channels that squelched nascent middleware threats and furthered the domi-nance of the API set exposed by its operati ng system. The exclusive contracts into which Microsoft entered with IAPs were likewise aimed at foreclosing channels through which rival middleware might otherw ise have been distributed. Prohibiting Microsoft from continuing those exclusive arrangements, see States' Remedy \u00a7 III.G, at 269-70, would not have the same deleterious effect upon consumers as would the fragmentation of Windows. *** 3. Forward-looking provisions The district court exercised its discretion to fashion appropriate relief by adopting what it called \"forward-looking\" provisions, which require Microsoft to disclose certain of its APIs and communications protocols. Alt hough non-disclosure of this proprietary information had played no role in our holding Microsoft violated the antitrust laws, \"both proposed remedies recommend[ed] the mandatory disclosure of certain Mi-crosoft APIs, technical information, and communications protocols for the purposes of fostering interoperation.\" States' Remedy, at 171. In approving a form of such disclo- sure\u2014while, as discussed below, rejecting the States' proposal for vastly more\u2014the district court explained \"the remedy [must] not [be] so expansive as to be unduly reg-ulatory or provide a blanket prohibition on all future anticompetitive conduct.\" Id. (citing Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc. , 395 U.S. 100, 133 (1969)). *** a. Disclosure of APIs The district court recognized the \"hallmark of the platform threat\" to the Windows monopoly posed by rival middleware is the ability to run on multiple operating sys- tems: The \"ready ability to interoperate with the already dominant operating system will bolster the ability of such middleware to support a wide range of applications so as to serve as a platform.\" States' Remedy, at 172. In order to facilitate such interopera- tion the district court required Microsoft to disclose APIs \"used by Microsoft Middle-ware to interoperate with a Wind ows Operating System Product.\" Id. \u00a7 III.D, at 268. *** Massachusetts further argues the district co urt made no finding the required disclo- sure of APIs under the decree would \"meaningfully assist\" developers of middleware. Massachusetts objects both to the breadth of disclosure\u2014that is, the number of APIs to be disclosed under \u00a7 III.D\u2014and to the \"depth\" or detail of the disclosure, with respect to which Massachusetts claims \"the remedy fails to require the disclosure of Picker, Platforms and Networks Spring 2022 Page 467Picker, Platforms and Networks, Spring 2022 Page 468 sufficient information to ensure that the mandated disclosure may be effectively uti- lized.\" *** In sum, the district court's findings are fu lly adequate to support its decision with respect to disclosure. *** We do not find persuasive Massachusetts' arguments that the district court overstated or misapprehe nded the significance of the disclosure re- quired by the decree. In light of the forw ard-looking nature of the API disclosure provision, the court reasonably balanced its goal of enhanced interoperability with the need to avoid requiring overly broad disclosure, which it determined could have ad-verse economic and technological effects, including the cloning of Microsoft's soft-ware. Moreover, we cannot overlook the threat\u2014as documented in the district court's findings of fact in the liability phase\u2014posed by Netscape and Java, which relied upon Microsoft's then more limited disclosure of APIs. Microsoft managed to squelch those threats, at least for a time, but that does not diminish the competitive significance of the disclosure of Microsoft's APIs, a disclosure enhanced by the decree. We therefore hold the district court did not abuse its discretion in fashioning the remedial provision concerning Mi crosoft's disclosure of APIs. b. Disclosure of communications protocols The district court also included in the decree a provision requiring Microsoft to dis-close certain communications protocols. See States' Remedy \u00a7 III.E, at 269. As with APIs, we did not hold Microsoft's disclosure practices with respect to communications pro-tocols violated \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act. Communications protocols involve technolo-gies\u2014servers and server operating systems\u2014that are not \"middleware\" as we used that term in our prior decision. See Microsoft III, at 53-54. It is therefore not surprising the district court described the provision requiring the disclosure of communications protocols as the \" most forward-looking\" in the decree. States' Remedy, at 173 (emphasis in original). Communications protocols provide a comm on \"language\" for \"clients\" and \"serv- ers\" in a computing network. A network typically involves interoperation between one or more large, central computers (the servers) and a number of PCs (the clients). By interoperating with the server, the clients may communicate with each other and store data or run applications directly on the server. The district court found that servers may use any of several different operating systems, id. at 121, but most clients run a version of Windows.\" *** Massachusetts argues \u00a7 III.E will not enhance interoperability and there is no evi- dence, and the district court made no finding, that it will. Microsoft responds that \"a substantial degree of interoperability alread y exists between Windows desktop operat- ing systems and non-Microsoft server operating systems\" and the ability of third par-ties to license those protocols from Micr osoft pursuant to \u00a7 III.E will enhance interop- erability. The parties' divergent predictions point up the difficulties inherent in crafting a forward-looking provision concerning a typ e of business conduct as to which there has not been a violation of the law. *** Massachusetts objects that the district court should not have limited the disclosure requirement of \u00a7 III.E to protocols for native communications, which the district court found is only \"one of at least five basic approaches to achieving interoperability between Windows client operating systems and non-Microsoft server operating sys-tems.\" States' Remedy, at 234 ( citing Short \u00b6 35, 6 J.A. (II) at 3535). We think the district Picker, Platforms and Networks Spring 2022 Page 468Picker, Platforms and Networks, Spring 2022 Page 469 court prudently sought not to achieve complete interoperability but only to \"advance\" the ability of non-Microsoft server operatin g systems to interoperate with Windows and thereby serve as platforms for applicati ons. It was not an abuse of discretion for the court not to go further; indeed, to have done so in the absence of related liability findings would have been risky. *** 4. Web Services Massachusetts next argues the district cour t erred by failing to adopt a remedy ad- dressed to Web services. In particular, Ma ssachusetts claims the court should have extended Microsoft's disclosure obligation b eyond interoperation of server operating systems and PCs running Windows to reach interoperation among \"other nodes of the network encompassed by network-base d computing and the Web services para- digm, such as multiple servers or handheld devices.\"17 Microsoft responds by pointing out there was no mention of Web services in the liability phase of this case, and by claiming it has no monopoly power in the market for Web services, \"if such a [market] exists.\" Also, the district court found \"Web-browsing software of the type addressed during the liability phase will play no role in the creation, delivery, or use of many Web services.\" States' Remedy, at 127. *** Far from ignoring this area of rapid innovation, as Massachusetts claims, the district court concluded Web services are si mply too far removed from the source of Microsoft's liability in this case\u2014as to whic h the relevant market is operating systems for Intel-compatible PCs\u2014to be implicated in the remedy. Nor did the court think the States had sufficiently \"explained how the increase in the use of non-PC devices in conjunction with Web services will reduce Microsoft's monopoly in the market for PC operating systems.\" Id. at 134. Massachusetts claims the district court excluded Web services based upon the clearly erroneous premise \"that this new paradigm is a threat to the PC, and not to Windows.\" For a correct understanding Massachusetts points us to the testimony of Jonathon Schwartz, Chief Strategy Officer at Sun Mi crosystems: \"[S]o long as consumers can access Web services using competing devices and operating systems, they are free to switch away from Windows if competing al ternatives are more attractive.\" Direct Tes- timony \u00b6 37, 2 J.A. (II) at 882. According to Massachusetts, the district court acknowl- edged as much when it stated: The Chief Strategy Officer for Sun Microsystems, Inc., Jonathon Schwartz, testi- fying on behalf of Plaintiffs ... theorized that \"[i]f the most popular applications are delivered as Web services, instead of [as] stand-alone PC applications, the ap- plications barrier protecting Windows could be substantially eroded.\" States' Remedy, at 127 (brackets in original). Cl early, however, the district court ex- pressed its view that Schwartz was \"theoriz [ing],\" not stating a conclusion based upon fact. In any event, the district court was primarily\u2014and correctly\u2014focused upon whether a provision addressing Web services could be linked to Microsoft's liability in Microsoft III ; it could not. 17 Although Massachusetts does not mention it, the States' proposal would have done just that, see SPR \u00a7 C, 6 J.A. (II) at 3172; see also SPR \u00a7 4, id. at 3172-73, extending Microsoft's disclosure obligation to interoperability with respect to, among others, \"Handheld Computing Devices\"\u2014a term defined in the SPR to Platforms and Spring 2022 Page 469Picker, Platforms and Networks, Spring 2022 Page 470 Moreover, it does not follow that, because a proposed requirement could reduce the applications barrier to entry, it must be ad opted. Recall the applications barrier to entry arose only in part because of Microsoft's unlawful practices; it was also the product of \"positive network effects.\" 84 F.Supp.2d at 20 . If the court is not to risk harming consumers, then the remedy must address th e applications barrier to entry in a manner traceable to our decision in Microsoft III. This the decree does by opening the channels of distribution for non-Microsoft middleware. The district court reasonably deter- mined, based upon evidence in the record, a provision addressing Web services might not be so benign. States' Remedy, at 134. *** 6. Open Source Internet Explorer Massachusetts argues the district court abused its discretion in rejecting the States'\"open-source IE\" provision, which would require that Microsoft ... disclose and license all source code for all Browser software [and that the license] grant a royalty-free, non-excl usive perpetual right on a non-discrimi- natory basis to make, use, modify and distribute without limitation products im- plementing or derived from Microsoft's source code.... SPR \u00a7 12, 6 J.A. (II) at 3178. Microsoft res ponds that this type of remedy is unneces- sary because the decree already proscribes the anticompetitive conduct by which Mi- crosoft had unlawfully raised the applications barrier to entry and thereby diminished the threat posed by platforms riva ling Microsoft's operating system. The district court rejected the States' proposal for three reasons. First, the open- source IE proposal \"ignores the theory of lia bility in this case,\" which was directed at Microsoft's unlawful to cross-pl applications, not operating sys- tems,\" States' Remedy, at 185; the proposed remedy would directly benefit makers of non-Microsoft operating systems, even though the harm, if any, to them was indirect. Second, the proposal would \"provide [a] sign ificant benefit to competitors but [has] not been shown to benefit competition.\" Id. Finally, the proposal would work a \"de facto divestiture\" and therefore should be analyzed as a structural remedy pursuant to this court's opinion on liability. Id. at 186. Here the court carefully considered the \"causal connection\" between Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct and its dominance of the market for operating systems, and held the causal link insufficient to warrant a structural remedy. States' Remedy, at 186. Massachusetts argues the district court \"improperly ignored evidence that IE's dom- inance is competitively important for Micr osoft\" and complains that Microsoft \"ad- vantage[s] its own middleware by using the browser to limit the functionality of com- peting products.\" These are not objections, however, to the district court's reasons for rejecting the States' proposal. Rather, they ar e criticisms of what Massachusetts terms the district court's \"implicit determination that [certain] facts were not relevant\" to its analysis of the open-source IE provision. For instance, Massachusetts points to the testimony of David Richards of RealNetwork s stating there would be \"substantial end user benefit\" if Microsoft disclosed enough APIs to allow competitors such as Real- Networks to create their own versions of the \"Media Bar,\" one of Microsoft's recent additions to the IE interface. According to Richards, the Media Bar is a version of Microsoft's Windows Media Player \"embedde d as the default media player\" in IE. \u00b6 79, id. at 1094-95. If Microsoft were to disclose the internal architecture of the Media Bar, including the APIs upon which it relies, he says, then end users could \"play back more digital formats within the [IE] browser than [Microsoft's] Windows Media Picker, Platforms and Networks Spring 2022 Page 470Picker, Platforms and Networks, Spring 2022 Page 471 Player, including our own RealAudio and RealVideo \u00b6\u00b6 81, 82, id.at 1098. *** The district court's premise, as discussed mo re fully below, was that the fruit of Microsoft's unlawful conduct was not the ha rm particular competitors may have suf- fered but rather Microsoft's freedom from pl atform threats posed by makers of rival middleware. See Part II.B.1. The district court properly focused, therefore, upon open- ing the channels of distribution to such rivals; facts tending to show harm to specific competitors are not relevant to that task . Also recall the district court was properly concerned with avoiding a disclosure requirement so broad it could lead to the cloning of Microsoft's products. That, in essence, appears to be what the cited testimony would require with respect to Microsoft's Media Bar. *** Massachusetts next argues the district co urt \"misunderstood\" that the States' open- source IE proposal could \"reestablish a cross- platform browser,\" thereby allowing ap- plications to be written to APIs exposed by IE and, as a result, lower the applications barrier to entry. As discussed in preceding sections of this opinion, the decree the district court approved includes several pr ovisions addressed directly to Microsoft's efforts to extinguish nascent threats to it s operating system. Specifically, the decree restores the conditions necessary for rival mi ddleware to serve as a platform threat to Windows and thereby speaks directly to our holding with respect to liability. See Mi- crosoft III. Moreover, the district court found th e States' open-source IE proposal ig- nores the theory of liability in this case not because the court \"misunderstood\" the implications of the proposal but because the proposal would most likely benefit mak-ers of competing operating systems, namely , Apple and Linux, rather than restore competitive conditions for potential developers of rival middleware. States' Remedy, at 242-43. That is why the court conclude d the open-source IE proposal would help specific competitors but not the process of competition. There is more than one way to redress Microsoft's having unlawfully ra ised the applications barrier. And it was certainly within the district court's discretion to address the applications barrier to en- try as it did, namely, by restoring the cond itions in which rival makers of middleware may freely compete with Windows. Indeed, to have addressed itself narrowly to aiding specific competitors, let alone competitors th at were not the target of Microsoft's un- lawful efforts to maintain its monopoly, could well have put the remedy in opposition to the purpose of the antitrust laws. Massachusetts also complains the district court, in rejecting the open-source IE pro- vision, erred by probing the causal connection between Microsoft's unlawful acts and harm to consumers. In response Microsoft points out that the district court viewed the States' proposed relief as structural and therefore applied a test of causation along the lines we set out in Microsoft III. See 253 F.3d at 106-07 . Our instruction to the district court was to consider on remand whether divestiture was an appropriate remedy in light of the \"causal connection between Micr osoft's anticompetitive conduct and its dominant position in the ... market [for operating systems].\" Id. at 106. *** As Massachusetts correctly notes, we were there addressing the district court's order to split Microsoft into two separate companies, whereas on remand, the district court was addressing the States' open-source IE proposal. But the district court reasonably analogized that proposal to a divestiture of Microsoft's assets. States' Remedy, at 185, 244. The court pointed to testimony both of Microsoft's and of the States' economic experts characterizing the open-source IE remedy as \"structural\" in nature. Id. at 244. Picker, Platforms and Networks Spring 2022 Page 471Picker, Platforms and Networks, Spring 2022 Page 472 Although Microsoft could continue to use its intellectual property under the open- source IE proposal, the \"royalty-free, non-exclusi ve perpetual right\" of others to use it as well would confiscate much of the va lue of Microsoft's investment, which Gates put at more than $750 million, \u00b6 128, 8 J.A. (II) at 4714, and the court clearly found to be of considerable value. See States' Remedy, at 241, 244. Massachusetts claims United States v. National Lead Co. , 332 U.S. 319 (1947), upheld compulsory licensing as a remedy while at th e same time rejecting the need for divest- iture. The licenses in National Lead, however, were not to be free; on the contrary, the Supreme Court specifically pointed out that reducing \"all royalties automatically to a total of zero ... appears, on its face, to be inequitable without special proof to support such a conclusion.\" Id. at 349. (The Court left open the possibility that royalties might be set at zero or at a nominal rate, but only where the patent was found to be of nominal value.) Here the States proposed Microsoft be required to license IE \"royalty-free,\" SPR \u00a7 12, 6 J.A. (I I) at 3178. Therefore, National Lead is worse than no support for the States' proposal; it tells us that proposal is \"on its face ... inequitable.\" 332 U.S. at 349 . Finally, Massachusetts claims the district court erred in rejecting the open-source IE proposal on the ground it \"is predicated not upon the causal connection between Mi-crosoft's illegal acts and its position in the PC operating system market, but rather the connection between the illegal acts and the harm visited upon Navigator.\" This plainly misstates the issue as we remanded it. We were concerned a drastic remedy, such as divestiture, would be inappropriate if Micr osoft's dominant position in the operating system market could not be attributed to its unlawful conduct. Microsoft III, at 106-07. The district court did not abuse its discretion by insisting that an analogous form of structural relief\u2014namely, divesting Microsoft of much of the value of its intellectual property\u2014likewise meets the test of causation. Massachusetts' statement that the open-source IE provision \"is predicated ... [upon] the connection between the illegal acts and the harm visited upon Navigator\" highlights precisely why the district court was right to reject that provision: The remedy in this case must be addressed to the harm to competition, not the harm visited upon a competitor. The district court's remedy is appropriately addressed to the channels of distribution for non-Microsoft middleware, including rival browsers such as Netscape Navigator. The court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to adopt the States' proposed open-source IE provision for the bene fit of Microsoft's competitors. 7. Java must-carry Massachusetts argues the district court erred in refusing to require Microsoft to dis- tribute with Windows or IE a Sun-compliant Java runtime environment, as the States had proposed. Consider: For a period of 10 years from the date of entry of the Final Judgment, Microsoft shall distribute free of charge, in binary form, with all copies of its Windows Op- erating System Product and Browser ... a competitively performing Windows-com- patible version of the Java runtime environment ... compliant with the latest Sun Microsystems Technology Compatibility Kit. SPR \u00a7 13, 6 J.A. (II) at 3179-80. The district court rejected this proposal because it did not think appropriate a remedy that \"singles out particular competitors and anoints them with special treatment not accorded to other competitors in the industry.\" States' Picker, Platforms and Networks Spring 2022 Page 472Picker, Platforms and Networks, Spring 2022 Page 473 Remedy, at 189. Microsoft adds that the proposal would give \"Sun's Java technology a free-ride on Microsoft's OEM distribution channel.\" Massachusetts argues the district court was wrong as a matter of law in thinking that mandated distribution of Java would benefit a competitor and not competition: \"If the district court were correct that broad distribu tion of Java did not benefit competition, then this Court could not have held that Mi crosoft's undermining of Java's distribution was anticompetitive.\" Not surprisingly, this non sequitur misrepresents the reasoning of the district court. That court focused u pon remedying Microsoft's unlawful foreclo- sure of distribution channels for rival mi ddleware, not upon propping up a particular competitor. Massachusetts also complains that if any measure that helps a \"would-be competitor of a monopolist\" is rejected out of hand, then \"competition can never be restored to a monopolized market.\" There is a real difference, however, between re- dressing the harm done to competition by providing aid to a particular competitor and redressing that harm by restoring conditi ons in which the competitive process is re- vived and any number of competitors may flourish (or not) based upon the merits of their offerings. Even in the latter instance, of course, a competitor identifiable ex ante may benefit but not because it was singled out for favorable treatment. Massachusetts also complains the district court ignored evidence \"that the wide- spread availability of the cross-platform Java runtime environment on PCs would re-duce the applications barrier to entry.\" According to Massachusetts, only if Java is available on PCs at \"a percentage that appr oaches the percentage of PCs running Win- dows\" will developers write to it. Testimony cited by Massachusetts extolling the ben-efits of Java ubiquity, e.g., Green \u00b6 53, 2 J.A. (II) at 949; Shapiro \u00b6 131, id. at 840, does not, however, call into question the district co urt's rejection of the States' proposal as \"market engineering,\" States' Remedy, at 262 (quoting Murphy \u00b6 239, 5 J.A. (II) at 2678), aimed at benefitting a specific competitor. B. Cross-cutting Objections Massachusetts also raises arguments that pertai n to multiple provisions of the remedial decree. One such objection goes to the district court's overall appr oach to fashioning a remedy. 1. \"Fruits\" Massachusetts also objects that, because the district court did not require open-source IE licensing and mandatory distribution of Sun's Java technology, the decree fails to \"deny Microsoft the fruits of its exclusi onary conduct.\" *** The present decree, how- ever, does not require that Microsoft be broken up. Nor did the district court adopt any other of the States' proposals it deemed structural in nature\u2014open-source IE, as discussed above, and the \"porti ng\" of Microsoft Office. The district court also specif- ically rejected the idea that IE was the fr uit of Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct, finding, \"[n]either the evidentiary record from the liability phase, nor the record in this portion of the proceeding, establishes that the present success of IE is attributable entirely, or even in predominant part, to Microsoft's illegal conduct.\" States' Remedy, at 185-86 n. 81; see also id. at 244 n. 121. Rather, the frui t of its violation was Microsoft's freedom from the possibility rival middleware vendors would pose a threat to its mo-nopoly of the market for Intelcompatible PC operating systems. The district court therefore reasonably identified opening the channels of distribution for rival middle- ware as an appropriate goal for its remedy. By \"pry[ing] open\" these channels, Interna- tional Salt , 332 U.S. at 401 the district court denied Micr osoft the ability again to limit Picker, Platforms and Networks Spring 2022 Page 473Picker, Platforms and Networks, Spring 2022 Page 474 a nascent threat to its operating system monopoly. The district court certainly did not abuse its discretion by adopting a remedy that denies Microsoft the ability to take the same or similar actions to limit competition in the future rather than a remedy aimed narrowly at redressing the harm suffered by specific competitors in the past. This dis- tinction underlies the difference between a case brought in equity by the Government and a damage action brought by a private plaintiff. Massachusetts also complains the district court erred in applying a \"stringent but- for test\" of causation in determining whether \"advantages gained by Microsoft could be considered a fruit of Microsoft's illega lity.\" Here it points to a footnote in which the district court, in the course of reje cting the States' open-source IE proposal, ques- tioned the extent to which the success of IE could be traced to Microsoft's unlawful conduct. See States' Remedy, at 242 & n. 119. We have already determined the district court properly refused to impose that structu ral remedy without finding a significant causal connection \"between Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct and its dominant po-sition in the ... market [for operating systems].\" Microsoft III, at 106; see also Part II.A.6. More important, the fruit of Microsoft's unlawful conduct, as mentioned, was its abil-ity to deflect nascent threats to its operating system by limiting substantially the chan- nels available for the distribution of non- Microsoft middleware. *** Finally, even if stunting Navigator and Java specifically wer e deemed the fruits of Microsoft's viola- tions, the decree would still be adequate because it opens the way to their distribution, both directly through the end-user access prov ision in \u00a7 III.H and generally through the other conduct prohibitions found in \u00a7 III of the decree. *** IV. Conclusion The remedial order of the district court in No. 02-7155 is affirmed. In No. 03-5030, the order denying intervention is reversed and the order approving the consent decree in the public interest is affirmed. So ordered.
