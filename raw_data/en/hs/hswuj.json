Emanating a familiar feeling and deeply rooted in the country's oldest traditions, this branch of authentic natural medicine is your safest bet.

Isotine Eye Drops, an ayurvedic solution based on rare herbs and bhasmas, assures 100% natural remedy with zero side effects. Dr Basu's ingenious discovery relieves incurable retinal eye diseases such as cataract, glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy as well as eye stress and computer screen strain effectively while also helping in improving the vision. It is filled with the goodness of wholesome natural ingredients such as Mint, Tankana purified, Yashed Bhasma purified and Tuth bhasma purified which strengthens eye muscles and restores their immunity, hence uprooting the very cause behind cataract and several other eye problems. Isotine is also extremely helpful in minimal focal powers for far and nearsighted issues. Ayurveda empowers the world with vision. Dr. Basu's Bansa Cough Syrup is an effective Ayurvedic formulation that helps treat respiratory tract infections and common cough & cold. It is equipped with anti-diabetic, anti-acidic, anti-viral and anticonvulsant properties and works as a bronchodilator, a cardiac stimulant, and an antispasmodic agent. The non-toxic, non-alcoholic and non- sedative cough syrup provides the best results with zero side effects. Brimming with natural herbs such as Sunthi, Mulethi, Ajwain and Tulsi, Bansa is undeniably an impeccable invention to fight off cough and respiratory tract infections.
