Best known for the foundational documents of the profession on nursing ethics, scope and standards of practice, and social policy, Nursesbooks.org is the publisher for the professional, career-oriented nurse, reaching and serving nurse educators, administrators, managers, and research-ers as well as staff nurses in the course of their professional development. ixPreface In 2011, the American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA) and the International Society of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses (ISPN) appointed a joint task force to begin the review and revision of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, published in 2007 by the American Nurses Association (ANA, 2007). The taskforce members were comprised of psychiatric-mental health nursing clinical administrators, staff nurses, nurs-ing faculty, and psychiatric advanced practice registered nurses working in psychiatric facilities and the community. This taskforce convened in July 2011 to conduct an analysis of the existing document and begin crafting sections incorporating the results of the analysis. In accordance with ANA recommendations, this document reflects the template language of the most recent publication of ANA nursing standards, Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, Second Edition (ANA, 2010). In addition, the introduction has been revised to highlight the leadership role of psychiatric-mental health nurses in the transformation of the mental health system as outlined in Achieving the Promise, the President's New Freedom Commission Report on Mental Health (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2003) and the Institute of Medicine's Report (IOM) The Future of Nursing (2010). The prevalence of mental health issues and psychiatric disorders across the age span, and the disparities in access to care and treatment among diverse groups attest to the critical role that psychiatric-mental health (PMH) nursing must continue to play in meeting the goals for a healthy society. Safety issues for persons with psychiatric disorders and the nurses involved in the recovery processes of persons with mental disorders are major priorities for PMH nursing in an environment of fiscal constraints and disparities in reimbursement for mental health services. Development of this edition of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice included a two-stage field review process: 1) review and feedback from the boards of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association and the International Society of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing and 2) posting of the draft for public comment at www.ISPN-psych.org with links from the ANA website, www.nursingworld.org, and the APNA website, www.apna.org. Notice of the public comment period was distributed to nursing spe-cialty organizations, state boards of nursing, nursing schools, faculty groups, x Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2EPREFACE and state nurses associations. All groups were encouraged to disseminate notice of the postings to all of their members and other stakeholders. The feedback was carefully reviewed and integrated when appropriate. 1Scope of Practice of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing Psychiatric-mental health nursing is the nursing practice specialty committed to promoting mental health through the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of behavioral problems, mental disorders, and comorbid conditions across the lifes-pan. Psychiatric-mental health nursing intervention is an art and a science, employing a purposeful use of self and a wide range of nursing, psychosocial, and neurobiological evidence to produce effective outcomes. Introduction By developing and articulating the scope and standards of professional nurs-ing practice, the nursing profession both defines its boundaries and informs society about the parameters of nursing practice. The scope and standards also guide the development of state level nurse practice acts and the rules and regulations governing nursing practice. Because each state develops its own regulatory language about nursing, the designated limits, functions, and titles for nurses, particularly at the advanced practice level, may differ significantly from state to state. Nurses must ensure that their practice remains within the boundaries defined by their state practice acts. Individual nurses are accountable for ensuring that they practice within the limits of their own competence, professional code of ethics, and profes-sional practice standards. Levels of nursing practice are differentiated according to the nurse's educa- tional preparation. The nurse's role, position, job description, and work setting further define practice. The nurse's role may be focused on clinical practice, administration, education, or research. This document addresses the role, scope of practice, and standards of prac- tice specific to psychiatric-mental health nursing. The scope statement defines psychiatric-mental health nursing and describes its evolution in nursing, the 2 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGlevels of practice based on educational preparation, current clinical practice activities and sites, and current trends and issues relevant to the practice of psychiatric-mental health nursing. The standards of psychiatric-mental health nursing practice are authoritative statements that describe the responsibilities for which its practitioners are accountable. History and Evolution of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing Psychiatric-mental health nursing began with late 19th century reform move- ments to change the focus of mental asylums from restrictive and custodial care to medical and social treatment for the mentally ill. The \"first formally organized training school within a hospital for insane in the world\" was estab-lished by Dr. Edward Cowles at McLean Asylum in Massachusetts in 1882 (Church, 1985). The use of trained nurses, rather than \"keepers,\" was central to Cowles' effort to replace the public perception of \"insanity\" as deviance or infirmity with a belief that mental disorders could be ameliorated or cured with proper treatment. The McLean nurse training school was the first in the United States to allow men the opportunity to become trained nurses (Boyd, 1998). Eventually, asylum nursing programs established affiliations with general hospitals so that general nursing training could be provided to their students. Early on, training for psychiatric nurses was provided by physicians. The first nurse-organized training course for psychiatric nursing within a general nursing education program was established by Effie Jane Taylor at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1913 (Boyd, 1998). This course served as a prototype for other nursing education programs. Taylor's colleague Harriet Bailey published the first psychiatric nursing textbook, Nursing Mental Disease, in 1920 (Boling, 2003). Under nursing leadership, psychiatric-mental health nursing developed a biopsychosocial approach with specific nursing methods for individuals with mental disorders. The PMH nurse also began to identify the didactic and clini-cal components of training needed to care for persons with mental disorders. In the post-WWI era, \"nursing in nervous and mental diseases\" was added to curriculum guides developed by the National League for Nursing Education and was eventually required in all educational programs for registered nurses (Church, 1985). The next wave of mental health reform and expansion in psychiatric nursing began during World War II. The public health significance of mental disorders became widely apparent when a significant proportion of potential military Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 3 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGrecruits were deemed unfit for service as a result of psychiatric disability. In addition, public attention and sympathy for the large number of veterans with combat-related neuropsychiatric casualties led to increased support for improv - ing mental health services. As a psychiatric nurse consultant to the American Psychiatric Association, Laura Fitzsimmons evaluated educational programs for psychiatric nurses and recommended standards of training. These recom-mendations were supported by professional organizations and backed with federal funding to strengthen educational preparation and standards of care for psychiatric nursing (Silverstein, 2008). The national focus on mental health, combined with admiration for the heroism shown by nurses during the war, led to the inclusion of psychiatric nursing as one of the core mental health disciplines named in the National Mental Health Act (NMHA) of 1946. This act greatly increased funding for psychiatric nursing education and training (Silverstein, 2008) and led to a growth in university-level nursing education. In 1954, Hildegard Peplau estab-lished the first graduate psychiatric nursing program at Rutgers University. The post-war era was marked by growing professionalization in psychi - atric-mental health nursing (PMH). Funding provided by the NMHA led to a rapid expansion of graduate programs and the start of psychiatric-mental health nursing research. In 1963, the first journals focused on psychiatric-mental health nursing were published. In 1973, the ANA first published the Standards of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing Practice and began certify-ing generalists in psychiatric-mental health nursing (Boling, 2003). Peplau's Interpersonal Relations in Nursing (1992), which emphasized the importance of the therapeutic relationship in helping individuals to make positive behav-ior changes, articulated the predominant psychiatric-mental health nursing approach of the period. The process of deinstitutionalization began in the late 1950s when the majority of care for persons with psychiatric illness began to shift away from hospitals and toward community settings. Contributing factors included the establishment of Medicare and Medicaid, changing rules governing involuntary confinement, and the passage of legislation supporting construction of com-munity mental health centers (Boling, 2003). Although psychiatric-mental health nurses prepared at the undergraduate level continued to work primar-ily in hospital-based and psychiatric acute care settings, many also began to practice in community-based programs such as day treatment and assertive community treatment. 4 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGMental health care in the United States began another transformation in the 1990s, the \"Decade of the Brain.\" The dramatic increase in the number of psychiatric medications on the market, combined with economic pressures to reduce hospital stays, resulted in briefer psychiatric hospitalizations char-acterized by use of medication to stabilize acute symptoms. Shorter hospital stays and higher patient acuity began to shift psychiatric nursing practice away from the emphasis on relationship-based care advocated by Peplau and toward interventions focused on stabilization and immediate safety. Psychiatric-mental health nursing education began to include more content on psychopharmacol-ogy and the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. More recent trends in psychiatric-mental health nursing include an empha- sis on integrated care and treatment of those persons with co-occurring psy-chiatric and substance use disorders, as well as integrated care and treatment of those with co-occurring medical and psychiatric disorders. Integrated care emphasizes that both types of disorders are primary and must be treated as such. Since the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has declared that recovery is the single most important goal in the transformation of mental health care in America (SAMHSA, 2006), psychiatric-mental health nursing is moving to integrate person-centered, recovery-oriented practice across the continuum of care. This continuum includes settings where psychiatric-mental health nurses have historically worked, such as hospitals, as well as emergency rooms, jails and prisons, and homeless outreach services. Psychiatric-mental health nursing is also tasked with developing and applying innovative approaches in caring for the large population of military personnel, veterans, and their families experiencing war-related mental health conditions as a result of military conflicts. Major developments in the nursing profession have a corresponding effect within psychiatric-mental health nursing. The Institute of Medicine's (2010) report, The Future of Nursing: Leading Change to Advance Health has strengthened the role of psychiatric-mental health nurses as mental health policy and program development leaders in both national and international arenas. Nursing's emphasis on the use of research findings to develop and implement evidence-based practice is driving improvements in psychiatric-mental health nursing practice.Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 5 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGOrigins of the Psychiatric-Mental Health Advanced Practice Nursing Role Specialty nursing at the graduate level began to evolve in the late 1950s in response to the passage of the National Mental Health Act of 1946 and the creation of the National Institute of Mental Health in 1949. The National Mental Health Act of 1946 identified psychiatric nursing as one of four core disciplines for the provision of psychiatric care and treatment, along with psychiatry, psychology, and social work. Nurses played an active role in meet-ing the growing demand for psychiatric services that resulted from increasing awareness of post-war mental health issues (Bigbee & Amidi-Nouri, 2000). The prevalence of \"battle fatigue\" led to recognizing the need for more mental health professionals. The first degree in psychiatric-mental health nursing, a master's degree, was conferred at Rutgers University in 1954 under the leadership of Hildegard Peplau. In contrast to existing graduate nursing programs that focused on developing educators and consultants, graduate education in psychiatric-mental health nursing was designed to prepare nurse therapists to assess and diag-nose mental health problems and psychiatric disorders and provide individual, group, and family therapy. Psychiatric nurses pioneered the development of the advanced practice nursing role and led efforts to establish national certi-fication through the American Nurses Association. The Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963 facilitated the expan- sion of psychiatric-mental health clinical nurse specialist (PMHCNS) practice into community and ambulatory care sites. PMHCNSs with master's and doc-toral degrees fulfilled a crucial role in helping deinstitutionalized mentally ill persons adapt to community life. Traineeships to fund graduate education pro-vided through the National Institute of Mental Health played a significant role in expanding the PMHCNS workforce. By the late 1960s, PMHCNSs provided individual, group, and family psychotherapy in a broad range of settings and obtained third-party reimbursement. PMHCNSs also functioned as educators, researchers, and managers, and worked in consultation-liaison positions or in the area of addictions. These roles continue today. Another significant shift occurred as research renewed the emphasis on the neurobiologic basis of mental disorders, including substance use disor-ders. As more efficacious psychotropic medications with fewer side effects were developed, psychopharmacology assumed a more central role in psychi-atric treatment. The role of the PMHCNS evolved to encompass the expand-ing biopsychosocial perspective, and the competencies required for practice 6 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGwere kept congruent with emerging science. Many psychiatric-mental health graduate nursing programs added neurobiology, advanced health assessment, pharmacology, pathophysiology, and the diagnosis and medical management of psychiatric illness to their curricula. Similarly, preparation for prescriptive privileges became an integral part of advanced practice psychiatric-mental health nursing graduate programs (Kaas & Markley, 1998). Other trends in mental health and the larger healthcare system also sparked significant changes in advanced practice psychiatric nursing. These trends included: A shift in National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funds from education to research, leading to a dramatic decline in enrollment in psychiatric nursing graduate programs (Taylor, 1999); An increased awareness of physical health problems in mentally ill persons living in community settings (Chafetz et al., 2005); A shift to primary care as a key point of entry for comprehensive health care, including psychiatric care; and The growth and public recognition of the nurse practitioner role in primary care settings. In response to these challenges, psychiatric nursing graduate programs modified their curricula to include greater emphasis on comprehensive health assessment, referral, and management of common physical health problems, and a continued focus on educational preparation to meet the state criteria and professional competencies for prescriptive authority. The tremendous expansion in the use of \"nurse practitioners\" in primary care settings had made nurse practitioner (NP) synonymous with \"advanced practice registered nurse\" in some state nurse practice acts and for many in the general public. In response to conditions including public recognition of the role, market forces, and state regulations, psychiatric-mental health nursing began utilizing the Nurse Practitioner title and modifying graduate psychiatric nursing programs to conform to requirements for NP credentialing (Wheeler & Haber, 2004; Delaney et al., 1999). The Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner role was clearly delineated by the publication of the Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner Competencies (National Panel, 2003), the product of a panel with representation from a broad base of nursing organizations sponsored by the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculty (NONPF).Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 7 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGWhether practicing under the title of clinical nurse specialist (CNS) or NP, Psychiatric-Mental Health Advanced Practice Registered Nurses share the same core competencies of clinical and professional practice. Although psychiatric-mental health nursing is moving toward a single national certification for new graduates of advanced practice programs, titled Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner, persons already credentialed as Psychiatric-Mental Health Clinical Nurse Specialists will continue to practice under this title (NCSBN Joint Dialogue Group Report, 2008). Current Issues and Trends Since the publication of the landmark report Achieving the Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America (DHHS, 2003), mental health professionals have been sensitized to the need for a recovery-oriented mental health system. Further, in 2010, SAMHSA approved awards to five national behavioral healthcare provider associations, including the American Psychiatric Nurses Association, to promote awareness, acceptance, and adop-tion of recovery-based practices in the delivery of mental health services. This theme of integrating recovery in practice has been echoed in Leading Change , SAMHSA's (2011) most recent statement on federal priorities in mental health. Here recovery is endorsed as the essential platform for treatment, along with seven other foci: prevention, health reform, health information technology (IT), data/quality and outcomes, trauma and justice, military families, and public awareness and support. These themes are echoed in important reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Institute of Medicine, and have been endorsed by consumer groups. The current mental health treatment landscape has also been shaped by multiple legislative and economic developments. The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA) is a federal law that has and is expected to continue to favorably affect the quality of care for individuals with mental and substance use disorders. The MHPAEA prevents group health plans and health insurance issuers that provide mental health and substance use disorder (MH/SUD) benefits from imposing less favorable benefit limitations for MH/SUD benefits than on medi-cal/surgical coverage. Thus, this vulnerable and highly stigmatized population will have equivalent MH/SUD benefits to those that are provided for general medical treatment.8 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGAnother important development is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) that brought, among other transformational changes, the promise of expanded healthcare coverage and an assessment of the current system's capacity to address anticipated demand. In the midst of launching this landmark policy, the economic downturn reverberated through federal and state budgets, which created immediate impacts on mental health services and became a harbinger of a decade of fiscally conservative policies (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2011). Another major focusing event was the pub-lication of data on the medical comorbidities and decreased life expectancy of individuals with serious mental illness (McGuire et al., 2002). These data hastened the movement toward integrated behavioral/primary care with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) monies rapidly shifting to fund innovations in integrated care delivery. The mental health initiatives of the PPACA and SAMHSA are also affected by the triple aim of the broader federal policy agenda: improving the experi-ence of care, improving the health of populations, and reducing per capita costs of health care (Berwick, Nolan, & Whittington, 2008). This shift is accompanied by significant payment reform (most prominently the return of case based and capitation models) and a call for partnership with healthcare consumers (Onie, Farmer, & Behforouz, 2012). This federal focus is finding its way into mental health care, particularly via initiatives to move Medicare and Medicaid into a capitated system (Manderscheid, 2012). This shifting reimbursement structure reflects the realization that engineering a significant impact on the mental health of individuals demands building healthy commu-nities that increase support, reduce disparities, and promote the resiliency of members. This 21st century mental healthcare system must be equally focused on prevention, quality, an integrated approach to health, and a paradigm shift that puts mental health care into the hands of the consumer. PREv AlENCE OF MENTAl DISORDERS ACROSS THE lIFESPAN: CRITICAl F ACTS Despite the promise of recovery, the prevalence of mental disorders continues to impose a significant burden on individuals, families, and society. According to 2008 SAMHSA data, during the preceding year, an estimated 9.8 million adults aged 18 and older in the United States had a serious mental disorder and 2 million youth aged 12 to 17 had a major depressive episode. More recent incidence data (CDC, 2011) indicate that 6.8% of U.S. adults had a diagnosable episode of depression during the 2 weeks before the survey was administered. In a multi-state survey spanning 2-year collection points, the reported rates of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 9 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGlifetime depression were similar in 2006 (15.7%) and 2008 (16.1%). The prevalence of lifetime diagnosis of anxiety disorders was 11.3% in 2006 and 12.3% in 2008. Finally in 2007, the National Health Interview Survey data on lifetime diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia indicated that 1.7% of participants had received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and 0.6% had received a diagnosis of schizophrenia (CDC, 2011). Although the prevalence of mental disorders remains high, treatment rates are distressingly low. In 2010, fewer than 40% of the 45.9 million adults with mental disorders had received any mental health services. The figure only improved slightly for those individuals with serious mental illness (SMI). Approximately 60% of the 11.4 million adults with SMI in the prior year had received treatment (SAMHSA, 2012). In 2006, increased mortality was found to be coupled with high prevalence of chronic medical conditions in individuals with mental health issues (Parks, Svendsen, Singer, & Forti, 2006). Further study indicated that, on average, peo-ple with SMI die 25 years earlier than those without these illnesses, and little of that increased mortality is attributable to direct effects of the SMI (Prince et al., 2007). These findings lent increased urgency to the call for integration of medical and mental health services (Manderscheid, 2010). In addition to premature mortality, Scott et al. (2009) found that comorbidity of chronic physical and mental disorders creates a synergistic impact on disability, thus supporting the need to give both mental and physical conditions equal prior-ity in order to adequately manage comorbidity and reduce disability. These comorbidities significantly increase healthcare costs (Melek & Norris, 2008), with only a small fraction of those costs (16%) attributable to mental health services. Estimates show that 2.8 million citizens in the United States are deal-ing with problems related to substance use. This figure is expected to double in 2020, particularly in adults over 50, casting specific concerns for the older adult population (Han, Gfroerer, Colliver, & Penne, 2009). SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS: PREv AlENCE AND COMORBIDITIES High rates of substance use disorders (SUD) and co-occurring serious mental disorders are also of great concern. The National Drug Use and Health sur-vey estimates that 25.7% of adults with SMI had co-occurring dependence or abuse of either illicit drugs or alcohol (SAMHSH, 2009). This figure puts co-occurring substance use disorders among individuals with SMI at a rate nearly four times higher than SUD in the general population (SAMHSH, 2012). These individuals, particularly persons dealing with co-occurring SUD 10 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGand major depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), demonstrate poorer life outcomes (Najt, Fusar-Poli, & Brambilla, 2011) such as increased disability and higher suicide rates. CHIlDREN AND OlDER ADUl TS Prevalence of psychiatric disorders in children is not as well documented as it is in the adult population. It is estimated that approximately 13% of children ages 8 to 15 had a diagnosable mental disorder within the previous year (Merikangas et al., 2010). The 12-month prevalence estimates for specific disorders of children range from a high of 8.6% for attention deficit/hyperactivity disor-der to a low of 0.1% for eating disorders (Merikangas et al., 2010). Similarly, the prevalence estimate of any Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) disorder among adolescents is 40.3% at 12 months (79.5% of life-time cases); the most common disorder among adolescents is anxiety, followed by behavior, mood, and substance use disorders (Kessler et al., 2012). Approximately 10.8% of the older adult population had some form of mental distress in 2009, and half of nursing home residents carried a psychi-atric diagnosis (SAMHSA, 2009). This prevalence does not include cognitive impairments and dementias like Alzheimer's disease, the most common of these impairments (New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003). Considering that in 2030, 20% of United States residents will be 65 years or older (Vincent & Velkoff, 2010), the need for mental health services for this population will continue to increase (SAMHSA 2009, 2012). DISPARITIES IN MENTAl HEAl TH TREATMENT Data from the U.S. Census Bureau (2004) demonstrate significant changes in the racial and ethnic composition of the U.S. population. Most significant is the steady increase in the Hispanic or Latino population, which rose to 12.6% in 2000 and will likely rise to 30.2% in 2050 (Shrestha & Heisler, 2011). Although rates of mental disorders in minority populations are estimated to be similar to those in the white population, minorities are less likely to receive mental health services for many reasons, including financial, affective, cognitive, and access barriers (Leong & Kalibatseva, 2012). Efforts to improve quality and access to mental health services for minority populations will need to include greater emphasis on expanding outreach to ethnic communities, developing cultural awareness and sensitivity among individual mental healthcare provid - ers, and increasing cultural sensitivity in healthcare organizations. Barriers to social inclusion, as well as barriers to accessible, effective, and coordinated treatment, contribute to health disparities within the entire Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 11 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGpopulation (Institute of Medicine, 2005). Financial barriers include lack of parity in insurance coverage for psychiatric-mental health care and treat-ment, resulting in restrictions on the number and type of outpatient visits, limits on the number of covered inpatient days, and high co-pays for services. The payment changes anticipated by the PPACA, particularly the expansion of Medicaid to 133% of persons above the poverty level, are likely to bring more individuals into the mental health system. However, the probability of receiving actual treatment may be affected by barriers such as scarcity and maldistribution of mental health providers. Geographical barriers include lack of affordable, accessible public transportation in urban areas and lack of accessible clinical services in rural areas. Cultural issues, including lack of knowledge, fear of treatment, and stigma associated with mental disorder, also constitute barriers to seeking help for mental health problems. Though grow-ing evidence shows the effectiveness of treatment for behavioral problems and psychiatric disorders, these disparities necessitate further efforts to improve access to mental health services. OPPORTUNITIES TO P ARTNER wITH CONSUMERS FOR RECO vER y AND wEllNESS The growing demand for coordinated, cost-effective psychiatric-mental health nursing presents the opportunity to be creative in developing psychiatric-mental health registered nurse (PMH-RN) roles in care coordination, enhanc-ing psychiatric-mental health advanced practice registered nurse (PMH-APRN) roles in integrated care, and developing service delivery models that align with what consumers want. The reimbursement shift away from fee for service and toward caring for populations creates incentives to develop non-traditional services that may have greater effectiveness in supporting the mental health of individuals and families and the construction of healthy communities. The focus on recovery supports PMH traditions of relationship-based care where the focus is on the care and treatment of the person with the disorder, not the disorder itself. By using therapeutic interpersonal skills, PMH-RNs are able to assist persons with mental disorders in achieving their own individual recovery and wellness goals. Research specific to recovery-oriented PMH nurs-ing practices is beginning to emerge. However, more of this research needs to be conducted in varied care and treatment settings and specific outcomes must be connected to recovery-oriented nursing interventions (McLoughlin & Fitzpatrick, 2008). At the systems level, current developments offer opportunities for psychiatric-mental health nurses to connect to the broader nursing and 12 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGhealthcare community to achieve a public health model of mental health care. In such a model, individuals would receive mental health and substance use interventions at multiple points of connection with the healthcare delivery system and the system would aim to match the intensity of service with the intensity of need. The vision must aspire to create a person-centered mental health system where prevention efforts are balanced with attention to individu-als with serious mental disorders. Such a vision will require unifying nurses from a wide range of specialties to create the structure for integrated care; it will also involve constructing consumer-centered outcome evaluation strategies so that all efforts are aligned with the individual goals of the person seeking care or treatment. STRUCTURE OF A PERSON-CENTERED , RECO vER y-ORIENTED PUBlIC HEAl TH C ARE MODEl: UNIFyINg EFFORTS Prevention: The Promise of Building ResiliencyIn 2009, the Institute of Medicine released its report Preventing Mental, Emotional and Behavioral Disorders among Young People: Progress and Possibilities (O'Connell, Boat, & Warner, 2009). The report contained a land-mark synthesis of what was known about the onset of mental disorder, risk factors, environmental influences, and how prevention was possible through strengthening protective factors and reducing risk factors. The report also pro-vided a systematic review of the science of the prevention of mental disorders, articulating the promise of developmental neuroscience not only to map the possible origins and courses of disorders, but also to demonstrate how preven-tion and early intervention might build resiliency. Clearly, the future of mental health must be grounded in prevention, on platforms of effective programs such as newborn home visiting for at-risk mothers, early childhood interventions, increasing children's social and emotional skills, and creating social supports within communities (Beardslee, Chien, & Bell, 2011). This paradigm shift has profound implications for PMH nurses, particu- larly in regard to their work with children and adolescents and their families. Creating a prevention-oriented mental health system will demand that PMH nurses, pediatric nurses, and family nurses understand the science base that supports prevention and the scientific principles aimed at helping children achieve regulation and build resiliency (Greenberg, 2006). Further, it is essen-tial that nurses communicate how a shared science base will help nurses refine interventions that are applicable in both primary care and mental health care (Yearwood, Pearson, & Newland, 2012). Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 13 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGUnderstanding the interplay of environment and risk has implications for SMI prevention throughout the lifespan. Such an approach recognizes the multiple determinants of mental health, risk, and protective factors (WHO, 2004). In a report about global initiatives on prevention, the World Health Organization (WHO) carefully traced the relationship of SMI to social prob-lems, particularly poverty, as well as the relationship of SMI to nutritional, housing, and occupational issues. Prevention, therefore, relies on impacting social determinants of health and reducing the impact of factors that increase risk, such as poverty and abuse/trauma (Onie, Farmer, & Behforouz, 2012). An increasingly important emphasis is placed on strengthening the health of communities, which empowers and supports individuals, as well as builds protective connectivity. Screening and Early Intervention Evidence that roughly half of all lifetime mental health disorders start in the mid-teens (Kessler et al., 2007) increases the need for screening and early intervention in children and adolescents. The synergy of prevention and devel-opmental neuroscience is progressing, particularly at the juncture where early intervention targets psychological processes relevant to the origins of particular mental disorders (March, 2009). Evidence-based programs are increasingly emerging to address early signs of anxiety, depression, and conduct issues in children and teens (Delaney & Staten, 2010). The profound impact of early adverse childhood events (ACE) such as family dysfunction and abuse on an individual's mental and physical health throughout the lifespan is well docu-mented (Felitti et al., 1998) and informs innovative programs for addressing early trauma and its impact (Brown & Barila, 2012). Screening and early intervention is critical throughout the lifespan, requiring shifting attention away from pathology and dysfunction and toward optimal functioning. Recent recommendations include depression screening in primary care when practices have the capacity for depression care support (USPSTF, 2012). There is increasing interest in prevention of depression relapse and the possible mechanisms that may limit its all too frequent occurrence (Farb, Anderson, Block, & Siegel, 2012). Embedding screening and early intervention into practice will require shifting attention away from pathology and dysfunc-tion and toward optimal functioning. Psychiatric nursing will be pivotal in weaving together the emerging neuroscience that supports building resiliency and the evidence-based practices that support early intervention. Their efforts 14 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGmust extend to building communication networks with nurses in primary care specialties to create prevention efforts that span disciplinary silos. Integrated Care Several promising initiatives, such as the Penn Resiliency program for teenage depression, demonstrate how to structure early intervention as signs of mental distress are emerging. In this program, using a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approach, preadolescents are taught how to challenge negative think-ing; i.e., by evaluating the accuracy of the thought, assessing the evidence to support it, and then devising an alternate response. This program has been implemented in a variety of settings, including schools. In program outcomes across 13 studies, data demonstrate that intervention prevents symptoms of anxiety and depression (Gillham & Reivich, n.d.). Healthcare systems, such as Intermountain Healthcare, have developed scales for systematically screening healthcare consumers; after the assessment, professionals complete a Mental Health Integration form based on the scale scores. The healthcare consumer is then assigned a level of treatment that matches her or his level of service need (Intermountain Healthcare, 2009). Such secondary prevention efforts of school-based health centers and large primary care organizations such as Intermountain must become the norm if APRNs are to engineer systems where persons are treated holistically, and mental health and medical needs are systematically acknowledged with equal vigor. This effort will demand that nurses see themselves as one workforce while recognizing the unique skills that each specialty contributes to the team. Problems such as high costs, fragmentation, gaps in coverage and care, and tendency to deliver care in highly specialized subsystems in the United States healthcare system have provided momentum to the movement toward an integrated care system. Integrated care involves caring for the whole person in a single place, an organization of services that is both more effective and less costly (Manderscheid, 2012). Manderscheid (2012) believes the pace of orga-nizational change to accommodate integrated care is accelerating \"like snow in an avalanche.\" Initially, models of integrated care called for variations in co-location of services where the emphasis of treatments depended on the needs of the population (National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare, 2009; Parks et al., 2005). These diverse and evolving models rely on technol-ogy and innovations such as integrated services in healthcare homes (Collins, Hewson, Munger, & Wade, 2010). Psychiatric nurses, who always remain close to the needs of the consumer, must ensure that as systems of integrated care Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 15 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGare constructed, there is a parallel effort to ensure that individuals can access them, are not intimidated by them, and know how to make the most of the services offered (Geis & Delaney, 2011). Integration should also be guided by the voice of consumers who outline how to build systems on collaboration, effective communication, use of peer navigators, and the critical support of family and community members (CalMed, 2011). Technology of a Public Health Model of Mental Health Care Healthcare technology will be expanded in the coming decade via the increas-ing use of telehealth and Internet-delivered services, the rising prevalence of Health Information Technology (HIT) to connect service sectors and build care coordination, and the integration of data systems to track outcomes and engineer rapid quality improvement. In their vision for the use of health infor-mation technology, SAMHSA (2011) plans innovation support of HIT and the electronic health record (EHR) to reach a 2014 goal of behavioral health care interoperating with primary care. Within this initiative are plans for developing the infrastructure for an interoperable EHR and addressing the accompany-ing privacy, confidentiality, and data standards. Such information exchange is anticipated to integrate care, contain costs, and increase consumers' control of their personal health care and health information. Internet-delivered behavioral health interventions, such as online cognitive- behavioral treatments for depression and anxiety, are rapidly being developed, which continues to clarify their key elements and outcomes (Bastelaar et al., 2011; Bennett & Glasgow, 2009). Rapid growth in Internet behavioral health treatment is likely to continue, and must address the challenge of creating interventions with fidelity to the framework of the original intervention and the careful measurement of outcomes. Emerging Models of Acute Care While there is widespread agreement among mental health providers and consumers that treatment should be provided in the least restrictive environ-ment, there is also recognition that, when needed, inpatient services must be available for those in crisis (NAMI, 2011). The continual shrinkage of inpatient psychiatric beds in the United States, which some estimates put at a deficit of nearly 100,000, has caused increases in homelessness and the use of emer-gency rooms, jails, and prisons as de-facto psychiatric inpatient treatment centers (Bloom, Krishnan, & Lockey, 2008; Treatment Advocacy Center, n.d.). In tandem with efforts to preserve needed inpatient beds are evolving models to provide acute care services to individuals in crisis both within emergency 16 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGdepartments and on small specialty units Currier, Brenner, & Brown, 2012; Kowal, Swenson, Aubry, Marchand, & MacPhee, 2011). The integration of Mental Health Recovery components into all service systems, including into all forms of acute treatment, is now considered vital. Persons in crisis need a safe environment and, as their illness stabilizes, a cul-ture that empowers them to re-engage with life in the community (Tierney & Kane, 2011; Barker & Buchanan-Barker, 2010; Sharfstein, 2009). Consumers, the federal government, and regulators believe that to reach these goals psychi-atric services must be recovery-oriented and delivered using a person-centered approach. Since the elements of the recovery framework mirror the Institute of Medicine's indicators for quality in health services (IOM, 2001), PMH nurses now have a platform for assessing quality in inpatient psychiatric care. This is a welcome expansion of inpatient quality indicators that have centered on limiting restraint and seclusion use in the last decade (Joint Commission, 2010; Stefan, 2006). While restraint reduction is critical, this narrow focus on quality fails to recognize that in addition to a safe environment, individuals with SMI need services that are person-centered and recovery-oriented. As the single largest professional group practicing in inpatient arenas, PMH nurses must provide leadership in constructing recovery-oriented environments and measuring these efforts with tools that capture the social validity of the services provided; e.g., the extent to which the type of help provided in inpatient care is seen as acceptable and having a positive impact in ways that are important to consumers (Ryan et al., 2008). Workforce Requirements for a Public Health Model of Mental Health Care Availability of a mental health workforce with the appropriate skills to imple-ment necessary changes in the healthcare system, as well as appropriate geographic distribution of this workforce, is crucial to improving access and quality. While the overall number of mental health professionals appears ade-quate, rural areas face shortages of clinicians (SAMHSA, 2012). Independent of healthcare reform and its potential to increase access through expansion of health insurance, an estimated 56 million individuals nationally will face difficulties accessing needed health care because of shortages of providers in their communities (National Association of Community Health Centers [NACHC], 2012). Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 17 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGNursing models for rural mental health care specifically address the inter- play of poverty, mental disorders, and social issues (Hauenstein, 1997). Such nursing models recognize that resource-poor environments require service models that move clients into self-management and bridge systems so that medical issues are addressed. The need for PMH nurses is great because their command of multiple bodies of knowledge (medical science, neurobiology of psychiatric disorders, treatment methods, and relationship science) posi-tions them as the healthcare professionals best suited to facilitate connections between mental health, primary care, acute care, and case management systems (Hanrahan & Sullivan-Marx, 2005). Given that the supply of psychiatrists is showing only modest increases (Vernon, Salsberg, Erikson, & Kirch, 2009), there is a great need, especially in rural areas, for additional clinicians who can provide psychotherapy, case management, medication management, and a range of other services. PMH-APRNs are prepared to provide a full scope of behavioral health services, including both substance use and mental health services (Funk et al, 2005).However, restrictive reimbursement policies and regulatory barriers associ-ated with scope of practice that limit healthcare consumer access to APRNs must be addressed to achieve access and quality goals. PMH-APRNs need to continue systematic and enhanced data collection on practice and outcomes to document their contribution to quality health care. Several curriculum frameworks have been developed to prepare nurses with the appropriate knowledge and skills to meet future healthcare chal-lenges. Essential PMH competencies have been presented for all practicing RNs (Psychiatric-Mental Health Substance Abuse Essential Competencies Taskforce of the American Academy of Nursing Psychiatric-Mental Health Substance Abuse Expert Panel, 2012). The APNA Recovery to Practice (RTP) curriculum committee is producing a curriculum to integrate recovery into PMH nursing practice, which will be disseminated by SAMHSA as part of the Recovery to Practice initiative. A key aspect of this curriculum development, and of program development in general, is having consumers of these men-tal health services at the table and contributing to the development of these systems of care (SAMHSA, 2010). Curriculum models should also include the competencies promoted by the Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) Institute, which provides \"the knowledge, skills and attitudes neces-sary to continuously improve the quality and safety of the healthcare systems in which they work\" (QSEN, n.d.).18 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGA comprehensive blueprint for building the PMH-APRN workforce has been suggested that includes recommendations for how the PMH nursing will increase its numbers and prepare practitioners with the specific competencies needed to build a transformed mental health system (Hanrahan, Delaney, & Stuart, 2012). This workforce plan calls on PMH-APRNs to include the role of individuals in recovery into every aspect of planning and delivery of mental health care. An additional emphasis focuses on expanding the capacity of com-munities to effectively identify their needs and promote behavioral health and wellness. Indeed, the coming era will demand strong alliances with individuals, families, and communities to build health, recovery, and resilience. PSyCHIATRIC -MENTAl HEAl TH NURSINg lEADERSHIP IN TRANSFORMINg THE MENTAl HEAl TH Sy STEM In the course of their practice, it is critical that PMH nurses consider the particular vision of mental health care that informs their practice. Federal agencies, commissions, and advocacy groups have identified a future vision of a mental healthcare system as person-centered, recovery-oriented, and orga-nized to respond to all consumers in need of services. These reports converge on several points, but most crucial is that a transformed mental health system is centered on the person. Integral in this vision are strategies for remedying the inadequacy and fragmentation of services, and for creating a workforce to carry out the transformation. There is particular emphasis on providing ser-vices to children, adolescents, older adults, and other underserved populations. In leading the transformation of the mental healthcare delivery system, PMH nurses must understand the key threads in the government/agency/consumer group plan and the factors that can affect enactment. The transformed mental health system will require nurses who can work between and within systems, connecting services and acting as an important safety net in the event of service gaps. PMH nurses are perfectly positioned to fill this role and make significant contributions to positive clinical recovery outcomes for this vulnerable and often underserved population. Definition of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing Nursing's Social Policy Statement (ANA, 2010) defines nursing as \"the protec- tion, promotion, and optimization of health and abilities, prevention of illness and injury, alleviation of suffering through the diagnosis and treatment of human response, and advocacy in the care of individuals, families, communi-ties, and populations.\"Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 19 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGPsychiatric-mental health nursing is the nursing practice specialty com- mitted to promoting mental health through the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of behavioral problems, mental disorders, and comorbid conditions across the lifespan. Psychiatric-mental health nursing intervention is an art and a science, employing a purposeful use of self and a wide range of nurs-ing, psychosocial, and neurobiological evidence to produce effective outcomes. PMH nurses work with people who are experiencing physical, psychological, mental, and spiritual distress. They provide comprehensive, person-centered behavioral and psychiatric care in a variety of settings across the continuum of care. Essential components of PMH nursing practice include health and wellness promotion through identification of mental health issues, prevention of mental health problems, care of mental health problems, and treatment of persons with psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders. Due to the complexity of care in this population, the preferred educational prepara-tion is at the baccalaureate level with credentialing by the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) or a recognized certification organization. The role of the PMH nurse is to not only provide care and treatment for the healthcare consumer, but also to develop partnerships with healthcare consumers to assist them with their individual recovery goals. These goals may include: renewing hope, redefining self beyond illness, incorporating illness, becoming involved with meaningful activities, overcoming barriers to social inclusion, assuming control, becoming empowered, exercising citizenship, managing symptoms, and being supported by others (Davidson, O'Connell, Sells, & Stacheli, 2003). The PMH nurse has the responsibility to do more for the person when the person can do less, and to do less for the person when he or she is able to do more for him or herself. In this way PMH nurses develop and implement nursing interventions to assist the person in achieving recov-ery-oriented outcomes (McLoughlin, 2011). This philosophy of directing and providing care when the person is in acute distress and eventually transferring the decision-making and self-care to the individual is rooted in Peplau's theory of Interpersonal Relations in Nursing (Peplau, 1991). An important focus of PMH nursing involves substance disorders. Just as Schizophrenic Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders are described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders are also described in the DSM as Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). For example, a healthcare consumer may have a primary mental disorder with a secondary substance-related disorder (e.g., a person diagnosed with bipolar disorder with 20 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGhypomanic symptoms who uses alcohol to slow down); or, a person may have a primary substance disorder with a secondary mental disorder, (e.g., a person who is addicted to cocaine and becomes suicidal as a result of the cocaine use), or a person may have two primary disorders such as schizophrenia and alcohol addiction. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has long advocated for integrated treatment of both mental and substance disorders (U.S. Health and Human Services, 2005). Thus, in the first example, if a healthcare consumer was admitted to a hospital with symp-toms of hypomania, the PMH-RN would not only need to assess and treat the symptoms related to mania, but would also need to assess the consumer for alcohol use and treatment that might include detoxification. Therefore, the PMH-RN requires competency in assessment and treatment of both disorders. Further, PMH nurses provide basic care and treatment, general health teaching, health screening, and appropriate referral for treatment of general or complex physical health problems (Kane & Brackley, 2011; Haber & Billings, 1995). The PMH nurse's assessment synthesizes information obtained from interviews, behavioral observations, and other available data. From these, the PMH nurse determines diagnoses or problems that are congruent with avail-able and accepted classification systems. This synthesis and development of a problem or area of focus differentiates the PMH nurse from others who work as nursing staff who may gather data for the PMH nurse. Next, personal goals or outcomes are established, with the individual direct- ing this process as much as possible. Finally, the nurse and the healthcare con-sumer develop a treatment plan based on assessment data and the healthcare consumers' goals. The PMH nurse then selects and implements interventions to assist a person in achieving their recovery goals and periodically evaluates both attainment of the goals and the effectiveness of the interventions. Use of standardized classification systems enhances communication and permits the data to be used for research. However, in keeping with person-centered, recovery-oriented practice, the goal/outcome development must be individu-alized as much as possible, ideally with the consumer developing her or his own goals with assistance from the PMH nurse (Adams & Grieder, 2005; McLoughlin & Geller, 2010). Mental health problems and psychiatric disorders are addressed across a continuum of care. A continuum of care consists of an integrated system of settings, services, healthcare clinicians, and care levels spanning health states from illness to wellness. The primary goal of a continuum of care is to provide Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 21 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGtreatment that allows the individual to achieve the highest level of functioning in the least restrictive environment. Phenomena of Concern for Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses Phenomena of concern for psychiatric-mental health nurses are dynamic, exist in all populations across the lifespan and include but are not limited to: Promotion of optimal mental and physical health and well-being Prevention of mental and behavioral distress and illness Promotion of social inclusion of mentally and behaviorally fragile individuals Co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders Co-occurring mental health and physical disorders Alterations in thinking, perceiving, communicating, and functioning related to psychological and physiological distress Psychological and physiological distress resulting from physical, interpersonal, and/or environmental trauma or neglect Psychogenesis and individual vulnerability Complex clinical presentations confounded by poverty and poor, inconsistent, or toxic environmental factors Alterations in self-concept related to loss of physical organs and/or limbs, psychic trauma, developmental conflicts, or injury Individual, family, or group isolation and difficulty with interpersonal relations Self-harm and self-destructive behaviors including mutilation and suicide Violent behavior including physical abuse, sexual abuse, and bullying Low health literacy rates contributing to treatment non-adherence22 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGPsychiatric-Mental Health Nursing Clinical Practice Settings Psychiatric-mental health registered nurses practice in a variety of clinical set- tings across the care continuum and engage in a broad array of clinical activities including but not limited to health promotion and health maintenance; intake screening, evaluation, and triage; case management; provision of therapeutic and safe environments; promotion of self-care activities; administration of psychobiological treatment regimens and the monitoring of response and effects; crisis intervention and stabilization; and psychiatric rehabilitation, or interventions that assist in a person's recovery. PMH nurses may be paid for their services on a salaried, contractual, or fee-for-service basis. In the 21st century, advances in the neurosciences, genomics, and psycho- pharmacology, as well as evidenced-based practice and cost-effective treatment, enable the majority of individuals, families, and groups in need of mental health services to be cared for in community settings. Acute, intermediate, and long-term care settings still admit and care for healthcare consumers with behav-ioral and psychiatric disorders. However, lengths of stay, especially in acute and intermediate settings, have decreased in response to fiscal mandates, the availability of community-based settings, and consumer preference. CRISIS INTER vENTION AND PS yCHIATRIC EMERgENC y SER vICES One of the most challenging clinical environments in psychiatric nursing is the psychiatric emergency department. Emergency departments are fast-paced, often overstimulating environments, with typically limited resources for those individuals with psychiatric and/or substance-related emergencies. Psychiatric emergency service can be based in a hospital or a community. The specific models of care continue to evolve and develop based on identified local health care needs. The current models in dealing with psychiatric emergencies include consultative services in a medical center or hospital emergency depart-ment (these psychiatric services may either be internally based or externally contracted); an enhanced, autonomous psychiatric emergency department; extended observation units; crisis stabilization units; respite services; and mobile crisis teams (Glick, Berlin, Fishkind, & Zeller, 2008). Extended obser-vation units, crisis stabilization units, respite service, and mobile crisis teams are alternative treatment options for individuals with a psychiatric emergency or crisis that does not require inpatient psychiatric treatment. Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 23 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGACUTE INPATIENT C ARE This setting involves the most intensive care and is reserved for acutely ill healthcare consumers who are at imminent risk for harming themselves or others, or are unable to care for their basic needs because of their level of impairment. This treatment is typically short-term, focusing on crisis stabi-lization. These units may be in a psychiatric hospital, a general care hospital, or a publicly funded psychiatric facility. INTERMEDIATE AND lONg-TERM C ARE Intermediate and long-term care psychiatric facilities may admit patients directly but more often receive patients transferred from acute care settings. Intermediate and long-term care provides treatment, habilitation, and reha-bilitation for patients who are at chronic risk for harming themselves or oth-ers due to mental disorders or who are unable to function with less intense supervision and support. Long-term inpatient care usually involves a minimum of 3 months. Both public and private psychiatric facilities provide this type of care. Long-term care hospitals also include state hospitals that admit patients through the criminal justice system. Often these forensic patients must remain in locked facilities for long periods of time; this is related to state statutes and legal statuses rather than clinical status. PARTIAl HOSPITAlIzATION AND INTENSIvE OUTPATIENT TREATMENT The aim of partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient programs is acute symptom management and stabilization with safe housing options. Partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient treatment programs admit healthcare consumers who are in acute need of treatment but do not require 24-hour medical management or 24-hour nursing care. These programs function as free-standing programs and also serve as step-down programs for patients discharged from inpatient units. RESIDENTIAl SER vICES A residential facility provides 24-hour care and housing for an extended period of time. Services in typical residential treatment facilities include psychoedu-cation for symptom management and medications, assistance with vocational training, and, in the case of the severely and persistently mentally ill, training for daily activities. Independent living is often a goal for occupants of residen-tial treatment facilities. 24 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGCOMMUNITy-BASED C ARE Psychiatric-mental health registered nurses provide care within the community as an effective method of responding to the mental health needs of individu-als, families, and groups. Community-based care refers to all non-hospital or facility-based care, and therefore may include care delivered in partnership with healthcare consumers in their homes, worksites, mental health clinics and programs, health maintenance organizations, shelters and clinics for the homeless, crisis centers, senior centers, group homes, and other community settings. Schools and colleges are an important site of mental health promo-tion, primary prevention, and early intervention programs for children and youth that involve psychiatric-mental health registered nurses. Psychiatric-mental health registered nurses are involved in educating teachers, parents, and students about mental health issues and in screening for depression, suicide risk, post-traumatic stress disorder, and alcohol, substance, and tobacco use. ASSERTIvE COMMUNITy TREATMENT (ACT) ACT is a team treatment approach designed to provide comprehensive, community-based psychiatric treatment, rehabilitation, and support to per-sons with SMI (Assertive Community Treatment Association, 2012). An ACT team is comprised of a group of professionals whose background and training include social work, rehabilitation, peer counseling, nursing, and psychiatry. The ACT approach provides highly individualized services directly to consum-ers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year. A 2003 study on ACT teams found that a full-time nurse was rated as the most important member of an ACT team (McGrew, Pescosilido, & Wright, 2003). levels of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing Practice There are two levels of practice. The first level of PMH practice is that of the psychiatric-mental health registered nurse (PMH-RN), with educational prepa-ration within a bachelor's degree, associate's degree, or a diploma program. This level is discussed in the next section. The next level of PMH practice is that of the psychiatric-mental health advanced practice registered nurse (PMH-APRN) with educational preparation within a master's degree or doctoral degree pro-gram. That level is discussed starting on pg. page 27. Further, two sub-categories exist at the advanced practice register nurse level: the psychiatric-mental health mental clinical nurse specialist (PMHCNS) and the psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner (PMHNP). The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) as described by the American Association of Colleges Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 25 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGof Nursing (AACN, 2004) has advanced education in systems function, analysis, health policy, and advocacy. Nurses with the doctor of nursing practice degree may be at the PMH-RN level (e.g., RN administrators or educators) or at the APRN level (e.g., clinical nurse specialists or nurse practitioners). PSyCHIATRIC -MENTAl HEAl TH REgISTERED NURSE (PMH-RN) A psychiatric-mental health registered nurse (PMH-RN) is a registered nurse who demonstrates competence\u2014including specialized knowledge, skills, and abilities\u2014obtained through education and experience in caring for persons with mental health issues, mental health problems, psychiatric disorders, and co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders. The science of nursing is based on a critical thinking framework, known as the nursing process, composed of assessment, diagnosis, outcomes identi-fication, planning, implementation, and evaluation. These steps serve as the foundation for clinical decision making and are used to provide an evidence base for practice (ANA, 2010). Psychiatric-mental health registered nursing practice is characterized by the use of the nursing process to treat people with actual or potential men-tal health problems, psychiatric disorders, and co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders. This nursing process is meant to promote and foster health and safety; assess dysfunction and areas of individual strength; assist persons to achieve their own personal recovery goals by gaining, re-gaining, or improving coping abilities, living skills, and managing symptoms; maxi-mize strengths; and prevent further disability. Data collection at the point of contact involves observational and investigative activities, which are guided by the nurse's knowledge of human behavior and the principles of the psychiatric interviewing process. The data may include but are not limited to the healthcare consumer's: Central complaint, focus, or concern and symptoms of major psychiat- ric, substance related, and medical disorders Strengths, supports, and individual goals for treatment History and presentation regarding suicidal, violent, and self- mutilating behaviors History of ability to seek professional assistance before engaging in behaviors dangerous to self or others26 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNG History of reasons why it may have been difficult in the past to follow- through with suggested or prescribed treatment Pertinent family history of psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, and other mental and relevant physical health issues Evidence of abuse, neglect, or trauma Stressors, contributing factors, and coping strategies Demographic profile and history of health patterns, illnesses, past treatments, and difficulties and successes in follow-through Actual or potential barriers to adherence to recommended or pre- scribed treatment Health beliefs and practices Methods of communication Religious and spiritual beliefs and practices Cultural, racial, and ethnic identity and practices Physical, developmental, cognitive, mental, and emotional health concerns, as well as neurological assessment Daily activities, personal hygiene, occupational functioning, functional health status, and social roles Work, sleep, and sexual functioning Economic, political, legal, and environmental factors affecting health Significant support systems and community resources, including those that have been available and underutilized Knowledge, satisfaction, and motivation to change, related to health Strengths and competencies that can be used to promote health Employment and military service Current and past medications, both prescribed and over-the-counter, including herbs, alternative medications, vitamins, or nutritional supplementsPsychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 27 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSING Medication interactions and history of side effects and past effectiveness Allergies and other adverse reactions History and patterns of alcohol, substance, and tobacco use, including type, amount, most recent use, and withdrawal symptoms Complementary therapies used to treat physical and mental disorders and their outcomes The work of psychiatric-mental health registered nurses is accomplished through the interpersonal relationship, therapeutic intervention skills, and professional attributes. These attributes include but are not limited to self-awareness, empathy, and moral integrity, which enable psychiatric-mental health nurses to practice the artful use of self in therapeutic relationships. Some characteristics of artful therapeutic practice are respect for the person or family, availability, spontaneity, hope, acceptance, sensitivity, vision, account-ability, advocacy, and spirituality. Psychiatric-mental health registered nurses play a significant role in the articulation and implementation of new paradigms of care and treatment that place the healthcare consumer at the center of the care delivery system. PMH-RNs are key members of interdisciplinary teams in implementing initiatives such as fostering the development of person-centered, trauma-informed care environments in an effort to promote recovery and reduce or eliminate the use of seclusion or restraints; promoting individually-driven, person-centered treatment planning processes; and, developing skill-building programs to assist individuals to achieve their own goals. Psychiatric-mental health registered nurses maintain current knowledge of advances in genetics and neuroscience and their impact on psychopharmacol-ogy and other treatment modalities. In partnership with healthcare consumers, communities, and other health professionals, psychiatric-mental health nurses provide leadership in identifying mental health issues and in developing strate-gies to ameliorate or prevent them. PSyCHIATRIC -MENTAl HEAl TH AD vANCED PRACTICE REgISTERED NURSE (PMH-APRN) The American Nurses Association (ANA) defines advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) as professional nurses who have successfully completed a 28 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGgraduate program of study in a nursing specialty that provides specialized knowledge and skills that form the foundation for expanded roles in health care. The psychiatric-mental health advanced practice registered nurse is edu- cated at the master's or doctoral level with the knowledge, skills, and abili-ties to provide continuous and comprehensive mental health care, including assessment, diagnosis, and treatment across settings. Psychiatric-mental health advanced practice nurses (PMH-APRN) include both nurse practitioners (PMH-NP) and clinical nurse specialists (PMH-CNS). Psychiatric-mental health advanced practice registered nurses are clinicians, educators, consul-tants, and researchers who assess, diagnose, and treat individuals and fami-lies with behavioral and psychiatric problems and disorders or the potential for such disorders. Psychiatric-mental health nursing is necessarily holistic and considers the needs and strengths of the individual, family, group, and community. APRNs play a pivotal role in the future of health care. Often primary care providers, they are at the forefront of providing preventive care to the public (ANA, n.d.1) ). Demand for healthcare services will continue to grow as mil-lions of Americans gain health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and baby boomers dramatically increase Medicare enrollment. The nation will call on APRNs to meet these needs and participate as key members of healthcare teams (ANA, n.d.2). Consensus Model: LACE (Licensure, Accreditation, Certification and Education) and APRN Roles The Consensus Model for Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) Regulation\u2014focusing on licensure, accreditation, certification, and education (LACE)\u2014was completed in 2008 by the APRN Consensus Work Group and the National Council of State Boards of Nursing APRN Advisory Committee. Broadly, the model identifies four APRN roles for which to be certified: clini-cal nurse specialist (CNS), certified nurse practitioner (CNP), certified regis - tered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), and certified nurse midwife (CNM). Each of these roles involves specialized graduate educational preparation that can be applied to a focused population. Finally, a nurse must demonstrate specific competencies as outlined by her or his practice area (NCSBN Joint Dialogue Group Report, 2008). Unlike other areas in nursing, the roles of a PMH-CNS and PMH-NP are virtually synonymous. In 2007, American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA) and the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) conducted a logical job analysis that described the purpose, essential functions, setting, and Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 29 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGqualifications needed to perform as a PMH-CNS or a PMH-NP. This analysis confirmed that the vast commonalities in practice warranted the development of one advanced practice examination for both roles (Rice, Moller, DePascale, & Skinner, 2007). With mental health parity and other healthcare reforms, PMH-CNSs and PMH-NPs play key roles in the integration of physical and mental health care and treatment in both hospital and community settings. All APRNs are educationally prepared to provide a scope of services to a population across the continuum of care as defined by nationally recognized role and population-focused competencies; however, the emphasis and imple-mentation within each APRN role varies based on care needs (NCSBN Joint Dialogue Group Report, 2008) The full scope and standards of practice for psychiatric-mental health advanced practice nursing is set forth in this document. While individual PMH-APRNs may actually implement portions of the full scope and practice based on their role, position description, and practice setting, the full breadth of the knowledge base informs their practice. PMH-APRN practice focuses on the application of competencies, knowl- edge, and experience to individuals, families, or groups with complex psychiatric-mental health problems. Promoting mental health in society is a significant role for the PMH-APRN, as is collaboration with and referral to other health professionals, as either the individual need or the PMH-APRN's practice focus may dictate. The scope of advanced practice in psychiatric-mental health nursing is continually expanding, consonant with the growth in needs for service, prac-tice settings, and the evolution of various scientific and nursing knowledge bases. PMH-APRNs are accountable for functioning within the parameters of their education and training, as well as the scope of practice as defined by their state practice acts. PMH-APRNs are responsible for making referrals for health problems that are outside their scope of practice. Although many primary care clinicians treat some symptoms of mental health problems and psychiatric disorders, the PMH-APRN provides a full range of specialized services that constitute mental health and psychiatric primary care and treat-ment (see below). Specialty programs in advanced psychiatric-mental health nursing education generally have focused either on adult or child-adolescent psychiatric-mental health nursing practice. However, with the ongoing national implementation of the APRN Consensus Model and Licensure, Accreditation, Certification, and Education (LACE) recommendations, advanced psychiatric-mental health 30 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGnursing educational preparation has adopted a lifespan approach which includes preparing PMH-APRN to care for individuals, families, groups, and communities from pre-birth until death. PMH-APRNs are accountable for their own practice and are prepared to perform services independent of other disciplines in the full range of delivery settings. Additional functions of the PMH-APRN include prescribing pharma-cological agents, providing integrative therapy interventions, various forms of psychotherapy and community interventions, case management, consultation and liaison services, clinical supervision, developing policy for programs and systems, and actively engaging in advocacy activities, education, and research. The settings and arrangements for psychiatric-mental health nursing prac- tice vary widely in purpose, type, and location, and in the auspices under which they are operated. The PMH-APRN may be self-employed or employed by an agency, practice autonomously or collaboratively, and may or may not bill clients for services provided. Primary Care Currently, PMH-APRNs provide mental health services in primary care via several avenues. Examples of how PMH-APRNs practice in primary care set-tings include but are not limited to (a) collaboration and consultation with a primary care provider, (b) providing behavioral health care in integrated set-tings, and/or (c) unifying primary care and behavioral health within a men-tal health service site in what has been termed reverse co-location models. These roles are constantly evolving as healthcare reform, payment structures, and service delivery models continue to alter the nature of primary care and its relationship to mental health service delivery (Delaney & Kwasky, 2013). Healthcare consumers are more likely to see a primary care provider than con-nect with scarce mental health care. Additionally, healthcare consumers may prefer receiving services in less stigmatizing primary care. Thus, integrated care is a strategy that is likely to expand (Manderscheid, 2010). Evolving and diversifying models for integrated care is essential, especially with regard to the large number of people that will be seeking mental health services in primary care settings, the complexity of treating medical and wellness issues among the serious mentally-ill (SMI) population, and the varying levels of mental health need that must be addressed in primary care (Delaney, Robinson, & Chafetz, 2013). To build these systems will require not just innovations in integrated ser- vice delivery models, but also attention to how the various components of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 31 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGthese systems fit together\u2014i.e., the work flow process, financial integration, the teams to build a culture of care, and the workforce to enact it (Delaney et al., 2013; Reiss-Brennan, Cannon, Briesacher, & Leckman, 2011). Effective integrated care models will necessitate that clinicians develop the knowledge and competencies to provide person-centered care and address the various levels of intensity of mental health needs, including individuals with complex comorbidities (Delaney et al., 2013). An important issue related to building this workforce involves how primary care is currently conceptualized, which in turn influences how the integrated care workforce is defined and how its training is supported (APNA, 2013). This workforce crosses traditional primary care and behavioral health care lines. The current restrictive definition of primary care (as residing in one of five specialty areas and at the point of first contact) limits the boundaries of the primary care workforce and perpetuates a mind-body split. A conceptualiza-tion of primary care that fits with the current expansion of services is found in an earlier definition of primary care forwarded by the IOM: Primary care is the provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for address - ing a large majority of personal health care needs, develop-ing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community (Donaldson, Yordy, & Vanselow, 1994, p.1). This definition creates more appropriate boundaries for the integrated care models that reside in both traditional primary care and expanded behavioral health care settings. As the conceptualization of primary care broadens to accommodate integrated care, it is clear that PMH advanced practice nurses are, by this definition, already delivering primary care services, which include the diagnosis and treatment of common health problems. These roles will only increase as the systems evolve and, given their unique skill set and clinical train-ing, primary care PMH-APRN practice will only expand in the next decade. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy interventions include all generally accepted and evidence-based methods of brief or long-term therapy, specifically including individual therapy, group therapy, marital or couple therapy, and family therapy. These interventions use a range of therapy models including but not limited to 32 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGpsychodynamic, cognitive, behavioral, and supportive interpersonal therapies to promote insight, produce behavioral change, maintain function, and pro-mote recovery. \"Psychotherapy\" denotes a formally structured relationship between the therapist (PMH-APRN) and the healthcare consumer for the explicit purpose of effecting negotiated outcomes. This treatment approach to mental disorders is intended to alleviate emotional distress or symptoms, to reverse or change maladaptive behaviors, and to facilitate personal growth and development. The psychotherapeutic contract with the healthcare consumer is mutually agreeable and usually verbal, although it may be written. The contract includes well-accepted elements such as purpose of the therapy, treatment goals, time, place, fees, confidentiality and privacy provisions, and emergency after-hours contact information. Psychopharmacological Interventions Psychopharmacological interventions include the prescribing or recommending of pharmacologic agents and the ordering and interpretation of diagnostic and laboratory testing. Collaboration with the person seeking help is essential to promote adherence and recovery. In utilizing any psychobiological intervention, including the prescribing of psychoactive medications, the PMH-APRN inten-tionally seeks specific therapeutic responses, anticipates common side effects, safeguards against adverse drug interactions, and monitors for unintended or toxic responses. Current technology and research, including genomic testing, can help PMH-APRNs understand medication efficacy. Case Management Case management by the PMH-APRN involves population-specific nursing knowledge coupled with research, knowledge of the social and legal systems related to mental health, and expertise to engage a wide range of services for the consumer regardless of age or healthcare setting. The PMH-APRN is the point person who is responsible for the integration of all care and related decision-making. The PMH-APRN case manager designates an organized, coordinated approach to care by overseeing or directly engaging in case man-agement activities. The PMH-APRN case manager identifies and analyzes real or potential barriers to care and intervenes to help provide access to appro-priate levels and types of care and treatment to achieve optimum outcomes. Case manager interventions may be with a single client, or a designated family, group, or population. Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 33 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGProgram, System, and Policy Development and Management The PMH-APRN may focus on the mental health needs of the population as a whole on various levels, including community, state, national, or international. This focus involves the design, implementation, management, and evaluation of programs and systems to meet the mental health needs of a general popu-lation (e.g., persons with serious mental illnesses and co-occurring substance use disorders) or target a population at risk for developing mental health problems through prevention, health and wellness promotion, identification and amelioration of risk factors, screening, and early intervention. These activities are informed by the full range of nursing knowledge, which includes a holistic approach to individuals, families, and communities that is cognizant and respectful of cultural and spiritual norms and values. Additionally, policy, practice, program management, quality management, and data analysis knowl-edge and skills are essential for success in this arena. This area of practice has taken on a greater importance since the 2010 Institute of Medicine's (IOM) consensus report on the future of nursing. One of the key messages of this report is that \"nurses should be full partners, with physicians and other health care professionals, in redesigning health care in the United States\" (IOM, 2010, p.3). The PMH-RN with advanced education and experience may assume these responsibilities in select instances. Psychiatric Consultation-Liaison Nursing (PCLN) Psychiatric consultation-liaison nursing (PCLN) practice emphasizes the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of behavioral, cognitive, developmental, emotional, and spiritual responses of individuals, families, and significant oth-ers with co-occurring [actual or potential] physical illness(es) and/or dysfunc-tion (ANA, 1990). This advanced practice psychiatric-mental health nursing role is performed in settings other than traditional psychiatric settings\u2014most often in medical hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. Additionally, practice settings have expanded to primary care, \"healthcare homes,\" and community settings. As an APRN, the PCLN role requires expanded knowledge of complex psychiatric and medical disorders, the ability to complete diagnostic assess - ments leading to DSM diagnoses, and considerable expertise in navigating intricate health systems. Consultation is used as a modality to provide successful psychiatric and bio- psychosocial treatment for healthcare consumers/families and to enable non-psychiatric healthcare providers to provide such care. PMH-APRNs will often work as integral members of an interdisciplinary consultation-liaison team, 34 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGapsychosomatic service, on independent liaison nursing teams, or as individual consultants within medical settings. PMH-APRNs provide highly specialized advanced assessments, diagnoses, and interventions with recommendations for effective behavioral health care planning and symptom management. Psychiatric-mental health consultation may be accomplished by either direct or indirect consultation models. In the direct model, the consultee is typically the healthcare consumer or family. Specific activities may include psychophar-macologic recommendations, prescriptions, and monitoring, behavioral care plan development, and implementation of stabilization-focused therapeutic interventions for individuals and families. For example, a hospitalized child that is diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may present increased anxi-ety, depressive symptoms, and suicidal tendencies. The PCLN may be asked to consult, which may include completing a full psychiatric evaluation and recommending psychopharmacological treatments. It is the PCLN who has the expertise to differentiate between medication-induced psychiatric symp-toms, primary psychiatric disorders, or a combination of both. Additionally, the PCLN would work with the nursing staff to develop a plan of how to keep the child safe and improve the child's mental status while continuing the medical treatment needed for the RA. In the indirect model, the consultee is the care provider or organization. In this approach, best practices are applied to general and unique clinical scenarios to improve individualized care as well as to improve overall health systems. The goals of consultation and liaison are mutually complimentary and interdependent. PCLN uses both processes in conjunction with specific theoretical knowledge, clinical expertise, and an ability to synthesize and inte-grate information to influence healthcare delivery systems (Gonzalez, Walker, & Krupnick, 1995; Lewis & Levy, 1982; Robinson, 1987). The PCLN role continues to develop, as does international expansion of the role (Sharrock, 2011). Referenced earlier in this document, integrated care is a major trend in today's healthcare landscape. The specialty skills and knowledge inherent in PCLN will continue to be invaluable as new integrated care models are implemented. Clinical Supervision The PMH-APRN provides clinical supervision to assist other mental health clinicians to evaluate their practice, expand their clinical practice skills, meet the standard requirement for ongoing peer consultation, and fulfill the need for peer supervision. This process, aimed at professional growth and development Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 35 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGrather than staff performance evaluation, may be conducted in an individual or group setting. As a clinical supervisor, the PMH-APRN is expected both to be involved in direct care and to serve as a clinical role model and a clinical consultant. Through educational preparation and clinical experience in individual, group, and family therapy, the PMH-APRN is qualified to provide clinical supervision at the request of other mental health clinicians and clinician-trainees. Although clinical supervision is not exactly the same as a therapy relationship, the PMH-APRN uses similar theories and methods to assist cli-nicians in examining and understanding their practices and developing new skills. PMH-APRN nurses providing clinical supervision must be aware of the potential for impaired professional objectivity or exploitation when they have dual or multiple relationships with supervisees or healthcare consumers. The nurse should avoid providing clinical supervision for people with whom they have pre-existing relationships that could hinder objectivity. Nurses who provide clinical supervision maintain confidentiality, except when disclosure is required for evaluation and necessary reporting. Administration, Education, and Research Practice The PMH-APRN or the PMH-RN with advanced education or experience also plays a significant role in administrative, educational, and research arenas. As health care is a clinical, consumer-centered business, a key to successful outcomes is to have people who are both clinically knowledgeable and knowl-edgeable about business practices making administrative decisions and holding significant leadership positions in healthcare organizations. Roles also include nursing educators, nursing school faculty, and researchers. Research practice may include a broad range of quantitative and qualitative approaches among the healthcare consumer population, nursing education, policy, and practice. Additionally, translational science in which nursing science is translated to the care and treatment of the healthcare consumer is another important piece of the PMH-RN's role. Self-Employment Self-employed PMH-APRNs offer direct services in solo private practice and group practice settings, or through contracts with employee assistance pro-grams, health maintenance organizations, managed care companies, preferred provider organizations, industry health departments, home health care agen-cies, or other service delivery arrangements. In these settings, the PMH-APRN provides comprehensive mental health care to clients. In the consultation and 36 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGliaison role, the PMH-APRN may also provide consultative services at the organization, state, and national levels. This type of consultation includes the provision of clinical or system assessment, development, implementation, and evaluation. Further, psychiatric nurse consultants have independent practices as legal consultants or experts for both individual legal actions and systemic actions or litigations. Self-employed nurses may be sole-proprietors or form nurse-owned corporations or organizations that provide mental health service contracts to industries or other employers. Other Specialized Areas of Practice PMH nurses practice in a variety of specialized areas. As healthcare policies change and the needs of the healthcare consumer change so does the PMH nurses' areas of practice. Some key areas include: programs of integrated care and treatment, telehealth, forensic mental health, and disaster psychiatric-mental health. INTEgRATIvE PROgRAMS Integrative programs provide simultaneous care and treatment for individuals with all mental disorders, including substance use disorders and co-occurring disorders. Typically provided by a team of trained professionals, these pro-grams exist across the care continuum and the span of all disorders included in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5 ) of the American Psychiatric Association, (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). As such, providers of mental health services, including PMH-RNs and PMH-APRNs, must be well-versed in the assessment, care, and treatment of those with co-occurring mental and substance disorders. In a 1998 SAMHSA consensus report on co-occurring disorder standards, practice, competencies, and training curricula, the following principle was emphasized: comorbidity should be expected, not considered an exception. Consequently, the whole system must be welcoming and accessible to consumers with all combinations of diagnoses; and, whenever possible, treatment of persons with complex comorbid disorders should be provided by individuals, teams, or programs with expertise in mental health and substance use disorders (SAMHSA, 1998). Further, individuals with co-occurring disor-ders present complicated, chronic, interrelated conditions that often require personalized solutions for the specific set of symptoms, level of severity, and other psychosocial and environmental factors. Thus, treatment plans must be individualized to address each person's specific needs using staged interven-tions and motivational enhancement to support recovery (SAMHSA, 2002). Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 37 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGTElEHEAl TH Telehealth is the use of telecommunications technology to remove time and distance barriers from the delivery of healthcare services and related healthcare activities. Electronic therapy is an expanded means of communication that promotes access to health care (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, 2009). The psychiatric-mental health registered nurse may use electronic means of communication such as telephone consultation, computers, electronic mail, image transmission, and interactive video sessions to establish and maintain a therapeutic relationship by creating an alternative sense of the nursing pres-ence that may or may not occur in \"real time.\" In telehealth, psychiatric-mental health nursing care incorporates practice and clinical guidelines that are based on empirical evidence and professional consensus. Telehealth encounters raise special issues related to confidentiality and regulation. Telehealth technology can cross state and even national boundaries and must be practiced in accor-dance with all applicable state, federal, and international laws and regulations. Particular attention must be directed to confidentiality, informed consent, documentation, maintenance of records, and the integrity of the transmitted information. FORENSIC MENTAl HEAl TH PMH-RN and the PMH-APRN levels of practice are found within forensic mental health settings. Roles include working with victims and offenders across the continuum of care from community (forensic ACT and conditional-release teams) settings to jails, prisons, and state psychiatric hospitals. In essence, any intersection between the criminal justice system and psychiatric nurs-ing can be considered to be in the area of forensic mental health. Estimates indicate that one-third of persons in jails and prisons have mental disorders, and most admissions to inpatient care are court-ordered (Torrey, Kennard, Eslinger, Lamb, & Pavle, (2010). Forensic PMH-APRNs perform psychiatric assessments, prescribe and administer psychiatric medications, and educate correctional officers about mental health issues. Forensic PMH-APRNs also provide therapeutic services to witnesses and victims of crime. DISASTER PS yCHIATRIC -MENTAl HEAl TH NURSINg Psychiatric-mental health nurses provide psychological first aid and mental health clinical services as first responders through organizational systems in response to environmental and man-made disasters. Disaster psychiatry is a growing field of practice designed to facilitate effective coping by disaster vic-tims and relief workers as they experience extreme stresses in the aftermath 38 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGof a disaster. The mental health problems experienced by disaster survivors are typically stress-induced symptoms that are precipitated by numerous and simultaneous practical problems that they encounter after the disaster. Disaster psychiatry and mental health services encompass a wide range of activities, including public health preparations, early psychological interventions, psychi - atric consultation to surgical units, relief units to facilitate appropriate triage, and psychotherapeutic interventions to alleviate stress to individuals, families, and children. Both PMH-RNs and PMH-APRNs may be actively engaged in the practical work of providing psychological first aid (Young, 2006) and com - munity education networking to assist in building community resilience. The APRN-PMH also engages in psychiatric triage, referral, and crisis stabilization, and addresses specific health issues with individuals who have pre-existing psychiatric-mental health and/or substance use disorders (Stoddard, Pandya, & Katz, 2011; Ursano, Fullerton, Weisaeth, & Raphael, 2007). Psychiatric-mental health nurses care for persons with psychiatric, behav- ioral health, and comorbid conditions across the lifespan and continuum of care. Using therapeutic interpersonal and/or pharmacological interventions, PMH nurses promote recovery for countless persons afflicted with the debili-tating effects of behavioral, psychiatric, and substance use disorders. Ethical Issues in Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing PMH nurses adhere to all aspects of Code of Ethics for Nurses with Interpretive Statements (ANA, 2001). Codes of ethical practice educate and inform pro- fessionals about sound ethical behavior while mandating a minimal standard of practice. While PMH nurses have the same goals as all nurses, there are unique ethical dilemmas in PMH nursing practice. Specific examples are provided for each of the nine provisions of the Code of Ethics for Nurses. These provisions are comprised of three groupings: the first three describe the most fundamental values and commitments of each nurse; the next three address the boundaries of loyalty and duty; and the last three examine the duties beyond individual encounters with patients and healthcare consumers [ANA, 2001, p. 10]. RESPECT FOR THE INDIvIDUAl Provision 1: The nurse, in all professional relationships, practices with com-passion and respect for the inherent dignity, worth, and uniqueness of every individual, unrestricted by considerations of social or economic status, personal attributes, or the nature of health problems. Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 39 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGCompassion is a key value of PMH nursing. PMH nurses show compassion by recognizing the importance of helping others through caring; instilling hope in those who feel hopeless; and empowering those who are powerless as a result of PMH disorders. Respect is another key value. PMH nurses respect the dignity and worth of every individual, based on the understanding that PMH disorders, like other chronic health problems, can be treated. Hence, PMH nurses are staunch advocates in helping to overcome negative attitudes and beliefs related to PMH to ensure appropriate, compassionate, and respectful care. COMMITMENT TO THE HEAl THCARE CONSUMER Provision 2: The nurse's primary commitment is to the patient, whether an individual, family, group, or community. Personal behaviors and attitudes can conflict with ethical guidelines. PMH nurses must be open to exploring and reconciling their personal experiences. They must also have a keen awareness of boundary issues with clients, whether healthcare consumers, their families, or the community and other groups. PMH nurses are willing to participate in self, peer, and supervisory assessment of clinical skills and practice. PMH nurses recognize that people with PMH disorders may have maladap- tive coping behaviors that affect the individual, the family and other groups, and society as a whole. Grounded on the understanding that these are brain-based disorders, PMH nurses appreciate the difficulties that individuals experience in continuing to behave despite significant negative consequences. PMH nurses also understand the behavior change process and recognize that setbacks will occur during progress toward recovery and the initiation or maintenance of a behavior change goal. The PMH nurse is always cognizant of the responsibility to balance human rights with safety and the potential need for coercive practices (e.g., restric - tive measures such as restraint or seclusion) or forced treatment (e.g., court-mandated treatment or mental hygiene arrest/involuntary admission for an emergent psychiatric evaluation) when individuals lack the ability to maintain their own safety. ADvOCAC y FOR THE HEAl THCARE CONSUMER Provision 3: The nurse promotes, advocates for, and strives to protect the health, safety, and rights of the patient. The PMH nurse monitors and carefully manages confidentiality, therapeutic self-disclosure, and professional boundaries through all forms of interaction 40 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNG(i.e., face-to-face, electronic record, social media). These obligations are intensi- fied in PMH nursing due to the vulnerability of the population, the complex-ity of clinical care, and legal issues which are dictated by legislation and the criminal justice system. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) was enacted to help protect confidential information through specific rules that outline how confidential information is shared. Because these rules have potentially severe civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, the PMH nurse has an obligation to be aware of the rules regarding protected confi-dential information. The PMH nurse understands that the therapeutic relationship between the PMH nurse and the healthcare consumer and family is unbalanced in nature. To formulate effective nursing interventions, care and treatment often includes gaining knowledge of the healthcare consumer's intimate thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Therefore, any sort of sexual activity or sexual intimacies (physi-cal, verbal, electronic, social media) with current clients, their close relatives, guardians, or significant others is unethical (American Psychiatric Association, 2010a; American Psychological Association, 2010b). The PMH nurse helps resolve ethical issues by participating in such activi- ties as consulting with and serving on ethics committees, or advocating for optimal psychiatric care through policy formation and political action. RESPONSIBIlITy AND A CCOUNTABIlITy FOR PRACTICE Provision 4: The nurse is responsible and accountable for individual nursing practice and determines the appropriate delegation of tasks consistent with the nurse's obligation to provide optimum patient care. The population of PMH providers is quite diverse. The specific proficiencies, skills, levels of involvement with healthcare consumers, and scopes of practice vary widely among specializations (e.g., physicians, nurses, social workers, psy - chologists, counselors/therapists, case workers, mental health workers, peer counselors). These roles often become blurred with inappropriate functions subsumed by healthcare providers working outside their scope of practice (e.g., assessment or diagnosis by a non-licensed provider and/or noncertified provider), academic preparation, training, or competency. PMH nurses may work in settings where nursing administration may not be dominant or even present. Thus, PMH nurses must be able to articulate their competence as well as their scope of practice; be aware of the professional standards that guide Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 41 Scope oF pRA cTIce oF pSY cHIATRIc -MeNTAL HeALTH NURSINGother team members; and possess the knowledge, skills, and abilities that all PMH providers have in common. DUTIES TO SElF AND O THERS Provision 5: The nurse owes the same duties to self as to others, including the responsibility to preserve integrity and safety, to maintain competence, and to continue personal and professional growth. PMH nurses must accord moral worth and dignity to all human beings. This moral respect extends to oneself and to others, including nurse colleagues whose practice may be impaired as a result of substance use, PMH disorders, or other physical disorders. PMH nurses are in key roles to change prevailing negative perceptions and attitudes toward individuals with PMH disorders. The PMH nurse demonstrates a commitment to practicing and maintain- ing self-care, managing stress, nurturing self, and maintaining supportive relationships with others so that the nurse is meeting her or his own needs outside of the therapeutic relationship. Moral distress (Jameton, 1993) should be identified, addressed, and reduced using an appropriate action plan (Epstein & Delgado, 2010; Lachman, 2010). PMH nurses render respectful and skilled care, understanding that lifelong learning is critical for professional growth and competence. CONTRIBUTIONS TO HEAl THCARE ENvIRONMENTS Provision 6: The nurse participates in establishing, maintaining, and improv-ing healthcare environments and conditions of employment conducive to the provision of quality health care and consistent with the values of the profession through individual and collective action. Given their knowledge, skills, and abilities, PMH nurses are often the first to recognize signs or symptoms of a psychiatric disorder in the workplace (e.g., depression, eating disorder, substance use). PMH nurses have an ethical obligation to report peer observations or concerns to their nurse leader. PMH nurses have a moral obligation to help address problems faced by colleagues with symptoms suggestive of mental distress and/or substance use that may potentially impact patient safety and violate public trust. PMH nurses may face situations of competing values, loyalties, and obligations that generate tension and conflict. Satisfying solutions to these situations preserve the integrity of nursing values while helping to maintain a safe environment for healthcare consumers.42 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Scope oF practice oF pSY cHiatric -MeNtaL HeaL tH NUrSiNGADvANCEMENT OF THE NURSINg PROFESSION Provision 7: The nurse participates in the advancement of the profession through contributions to practice, education, administration, and knowledge development. PMH nurses have an ethical obligation to be knowledgeable of and apply evidence-based practice guidelines, which includes risk assessment and man-agement. PMH nurses need to engage in continuous quality improvement efforts to promote the highest quality of care for individuals, families, and populations affected by PMH disorders. The PMH nurse engages in continu-ing education experiences to maintain and advance professional competence regardless of whether these continuing education experiences are required by the state board of nursing. COllABORATION TO MEET HEAl TH NEEDS Provision 8: The nurse collaborates with other health professionals and the public in promoting community, national, and international efforts to meet health needs. PMH nurses engage in partnerships with other specialty nurses (e.g., oncology nursing, addictions nursing, pain management nursing, emergency nursing, correctional nursing), government agencies (e.g., SAMHSA, NIH, IOM), the larger nursing community (e.g., ANA, APNA, ISPN, state nurses associations), and the public (e.g., National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, Mental Health America) to promote the societal benefits of prevention, treatment, and recovery to affected individuals, groups, and populations. PROMOTION OF THE NURSINg PROFESSION Provision 9: The profession of nursing, as represented by associations and their members, is responsible for articulating nursing values, for maintaining the integrity of the profession and its practice, and for shaping social policy. PMH nurses have a central role in advocating for environments where the human rights, values, customs, and spiritual beliefs of individuals, families, and communities are respected. PMH nurses recognize the importance of direct human interactions, communication, and professional collaboration. These relationships may be with individuals, with populations, and with other healthcare professionals and health workers, both within and between nurses and public representatives. Within the larger nursing community, PMH nurses inform policy development and implementation in recognition that PMH disorders are treatable and that nursing service is delivered with respect for human needs and values and without prejudice to vulnerable populations. 43Standards of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing Practice The following Standards of Practice and Standards of Professional Performance specify psychiatric-mental health competencies that must be demonstrated in addition to the current edition of Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice (ANA, 2010).

In early 2004, the American Psychiatric Nurses Association and the Inter- national Society of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses appointed a jointtask force to begin the review and revision of the Scope and Standards of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing Practice published in 2000 by the American Nurses Association (ANA, 2000). A panel of psychiatric-mental health nursing experts and ANA policy leaders convened in August, 2005, to review initial drafts and make recommendations. The panel members held leadership positions as psychiatric-mental health nursing experts in various nursing organiza- tions, including the American Psychiatric Nurses Association, the Inter-national Society of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses, the American Academy of Nursing, the Child and Adolescent (ACAPN) Division of the International Society of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses, the NationalOrganization of Nurse Practitioner Faculty, and the International Nursing Society on Addictions. The panel members represented psychiatric- mental health nursing clinical administrators, staff nurses, and psychi- atric advanced practice nurses working in acute psychiatric care settings. In accordance with their recommendations, this document reflects the template language of the most recent publication of ANA nursing standards, Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice (ANA, 2004). In addi- tion, the introduction has been revised to highlight the leadership role of psychiatric-mental health nurses in the transformation of the mental health system as outlined in the President's New Freedom Commission Report of 2003 (New Freedom Commission, 2003). The prevalence ofmental health issues and psychiatric disorders across the age span andthe disparities in access to care and treatment among diverse groups attest the critical role that the specialty of psychiatric-mental health nursing must continue to play in meeting the goals for a healthy society.Safety issues for patients with psychiatric disorders and the nurses in- volved in their care are major priorities for this nursing specialty in an environment of fiscal constraints and disparities in reimbursement formental health services.Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 115 Appendix A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. viiiDevelopment of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Stan- dards of Practice included a two-stage field review process: 1) review and feedback from the boards of the American Psychiatric Nurses Associa- tion and the International Society of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing and 2) posting of the draft for public comment at http://www.ISPN-psych.org with links from the ANA website, http://nursingworld.org, andthe APNA website, http://www.apna.org. N otice of the public comment period was distributed to nursing specialty organizations, state boardsof nursing, schools of nursing, faculty groups, and state nurses associa-tions. All groups were encouraged to disseminate notice of the postings to all of their members and other stakeholders. Ninety-three people reg- istered on the website during the posting period. Twenty-one com-ments and suggestions were received from individuals, faculty groups, and state nurses association psychiatric nursing groups. The feedback was carefully reviewed and integrated as appropriate.116 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. PSYCHIATRIC -MENTAL HEALTH NURSING : SCOPE OF PRACTICE Psychiatric-mental health nursing is a specialized area of nursing practice committed to promoting mental health through the assess- ment, diagnosis, and treatment of human responses to mentalhealth problems and psychiatric disorders. Psychiatric-mental healthnursing, a core mental health profession, employs a purposeful use of self as its art and a wide range of nursing, psychosocial, and neuro- biological theories and research evidence as its science. Introduction The nursing profession, by developing and articulating the scope andstandards of professional nursing practice, defines its boundaries andinforms society about the parameters of nursing practice. The scope and standards also guide the development of state-level nurse practice acts and the rules and regulations governing nursing practice. Because each state develops its own regulatory language about nurs- ing, the designated limits, functions, and titles for nurses, particularly at the advanced practice level, may differ significantly from state to state. Nurses must ensure that their practice remains within the boundaries defined by their state practice acts. Individual nurses are accountablefor ensuring that they practice within the limits of their own compe- tency, professional code of ethics, and professional practice standards. Levels of nursing practice are differentiated according to the nurse's educational preparation. The nurse's role, position, job description, and work practice setting further define practice. The nurse's role may befocused on clinical practice, administration, education, or research. This document addresses the role, scope of practice, and standards of practice specific to the specialty practice of psychiatric-mental healthnursing. The scope statement defines psychiatric-mental health nursingand describes its evolution as a nursing specialty, its levels of practice based on educational preparation, current clinical practice activities and sites, and current trends and issues relevant to the practice of psychiatric-mental health nursing. The standards of psychiatric-mental health nursing 1Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 117 Appendix A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. 2 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practicepractice are authoritative statements by which the psychiatric-mental health nursing specialty describes the responsibilities for which its prac- titioners are accountable. History and Evolution of the Specialty Psychiatric-mental health nursing as a specialty has its roots in nineteenth-century reform movements to reorganize mental asylums into hospitalized settings and to develop care and treatment for the mentally ill (Church, 1982). The first organized efforts to develop psychi- atric nursing started at McLean Asylum in Massachusetts in 1882. Early nursing leaders such as Harriet Bailey, Euphemia Jane Taylor, and LillianWald supported the Mental Hygiene Movement and advocated for the acceptance of the emerging specialty of psychiatric nursing into the larger community of general nursing. The first nurse-organized trainingprogram for psychiatric nursing within a general nursing education pro-gram was established at Phipps Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1913. This served as the prototype for other nursing education programs (Buckwalter & Church, 1979). Under nursing leadership, psychiatric-mental health nursing evolved from the narrow focus of medical models and mind-body dichotomy towards a biopsychosocial approach to mental illness, including the concept of mind as expressed in behavior and adaptation to experience (Church, 1982). Psychiatric-mental health nursing leaders played a criti- cal role in identifying and developing relevant specialized bodies of knowledge and in securing the didactic and clinical experiences neces-sary for students to achieve competence as mental health nurses. The successful promotion of the integration of mental health con- cepts into general nursing educational programs facilitated a national public awareness of the relationship between mental and physical health in achieving patient outcomes. Through such efforts, psychiatric-mental health nursing practice moved far beyond the walls of state hospital institutions to meet the mental health needs of the community (Church, 1982). This more visible position became extremely importantwhen the next wave of reform occurred in the 1940s with the passage of the National Mental Health Act and the development of nursing graduate programs in psychiatric-mental health nursing.118 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope of Practice 3Many nurses entered graduate programs in psychiatric-mental health nursing once they became available beginning in 1954. However, reg- istered nurses prepared at the undergraduate level continued to prac- tice within the specialty of psychiatric-mental health nursing, primarily in hospital-based and psychiatric acute care settings. In recognition ofthis specialty nursing practice, the American Nurses CredentialingCenter (ANCC) began to offer certification in psychiatric-mental health nursing at the undergraduate level in 1979. As the locus of care moved towards community-based programs, psychiatric-mental health nursescontinued to develop their role to meet the needs of patients across the entire spectrum of care including continuing day treatment programs and group homes. Origins of the Advanced Practice Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing Role Specialty nursing at the graduate level began to evolve in the late 1950s in response to the passage of the National Mental Health Act of 1946and the creation of the National Institute of Mental Health in 1949. The National Mental Health Act of 1946 identified psychiatric nursing as one of four core disciplines for the provision of psychiatric care and treat-ment, along with psychiatry, psychology, and social work. Nurses played an active role in meeting the growing demand for psychiatric services that resulted from increasing awareness of post-war mental healthissues (Bigbee & Amidi-Nouri, 2000). The incidence of \"battle fatigue\" led to the recognition of the need for more mental health professionals. The first specialty degree in psychiatric-mental health nursing, a master's degree, was awarded at Rutgers University in 1954 under the leadership of Hildegard Peplau. In contrast to existing graduate nursing programs that focused on developing educators and consultants, gradu- ate education in psychiatric-mental health nursing was designed to pre- pare nurse therapists to assess and diagnose mental health problemsand psychiatric disorders, and provide individual, group, and family therapy. Psychiatric nurses pioneered the development of the advanced practice nursing role and led in establishing national specialty certifi-cation through the American Nurses Association. The Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963 facilitated the expansion of psychiatric Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) practice intoPsychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 119 Appendix A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. 4 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practiceoutpatient and ambulatory care sites. These master's and doctorally pre- pared CNSs fulfilled a crucial role in helping deinstitutionalized mentallyill persons adapt to community life. Traineeships to fund graduate edu- cation provided through the National Institute of Mental Health played a significant role in expanding the psychiatric Clinical Nurse Specialistworkforce. By the late 1960s they were providing individual, group, andfamily psychotherapy in a broad range of settings and obtaining third- party reimbursement. Psychiatric Clinical Nurse Specialists were also functioning as educators, researchers, and managers, and working inconsultation-liaison positions or in the area of addictions. These roles continue today. Another paradigm shift occurred as research renewed the emphasis on the neurobiologic basis of mental illness and addiction. As more efficacious psychotropic medications with fewer side effects were de- veloped, psychopharmacology assumed a more central role in psychi- atric treatment. The role of the psychiatric-mental health Clinical NurseSpecialist evolved to encompass the expanding biopsychosocial per-spective, and the competencies required for practice were kept congru- ent with emerging science. Many psychiatric graduate nursing programs added neurobiology, advanced health assessment, pharmacology,pathophysiology, and the diagnosis and medical management of psychiatric illness to their curricula. Similarly, preparation for prescrip- tive privileges became embedded in advanced practice psychiatric- mental health nursing graduate programs (Kaas & Markley, 1998). Other trends in mental health and the larger healthcare system sparked other significant changes in advanced practice psychiatric nurs- ing. These trends included: A shift in National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funds from education to research, leading to a dramatic decline in enrollment in psychiatric nursing graduate programs (Taylor, 1999). An increased awareness of physical health problems in mentally ill persons living in community settings (Chafetz et al., 2005). The shift to primary care as a primary point of entry for compre- hensive health care, including psychiatric specialty care. The growth and public recognition of the nurse practitioner role in primary care settings.120 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope of Practice 5In response to these challenges, psychiatric nursing graduate pro- grams changed their curricula to include greater emphasis on compre- hensive health assessment and referral and management of common physical health problems, and a continued focus on educational prepa- ration to meet the state criteria and professional competencies for pre-scriptive authority. The tremendous expansion in the use of nursepractitioners in primary care settings had made Nurse Practitioner syn- onymous with advanced practice nurse for many in the general public and in some state practice acts. Although psychiatric-mental healthnursing was not seeking a title change (Bjorklund, 2003), the specialty found itself drawn toward the use of the title Nurse Practitioner in re- sponse to market forces and state regulations (Wheeler & Haber, 2004;Delaney et al., 1999). The Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner role was clearly delineated by the publication of the Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner Competencies (National Panel, 2003), the prod- uct of a panel with representation from a broad base of nursing orga- nizations sponsored by the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculty. Psychiatric-Mental Health Advanced Practice Nurses, whether they practice under the title of CNS or NP , share the same core competencies of clinical and professional practice. This is reflected in the core curricu- lum of graduate Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing programs. Since there is little evidence of consistent differences in these roles nation- wide, support has grown within the specialty for use of the term Advanced Practice Registered Nurse-Psychiatric-Mental Health (APRN- PMH) as the preferred title for advanced practice psychiatric nursing. ANA identifies Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) as profes-sional nurses who have successfully completed a graduate program of study in a nursing specialty that provides specialized knowledge and skills that form the foundation for expanded roles in health care. Current Issues and Trends Major changes in the healthcare delivery system, practice patterns of health professionals, and funding continue to have a profound effect on mental health care and psychiatric-mental health nursing practice.Nationally, healthcare delivery systems, educational institutions, policymakers, and health professionals have been challenged to create aPsychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 121 Appendix A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. 6 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practicevision for mental healthcare delivery that reduces health disparities and embeds quality, safety, evidence-based practice, inter-professionalpractice, and cultural competence as essential dimensions of consumer- focused twenty-first-century mental healthcare delivery and profes- sional practice (New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003;Daniels & Adams, 2004). Prevalence of Mental Disorders Across the Lifespan Because mental disorders are a major health problem in the UnitedStates and internationally, a challenge has been issued to all core health professions to identify, treat, and prevent mental illness. An estimated 22% of Americans aged 18 and older, about one in five adults, sufferfrom a diagnosable psychiatric disorder at any given time. Based on the 1998 U.S. Census residential population estimate, this figure translates to some 44.3 million people. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2002) cites depression as the number one health problem worldwide. Approximately 15% of the population with a medical illness has co-occurring psychiatric illnesses. This co-morbidity predisposes them to a persistent course of chronic illness and increased utilization of mental health and other resources.Furthermore, four of the ten leading causes of disability in the United States and other developed countries are psychiatric disorders, namely major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders. WHO (2001) reports that psychiatric disorders account for 24% of all health-related disability, 12% of alcohol and drug use disorders, and 7% of Alzheimer's and dementias. Adding these categories together allowsone to conclude that fully 43% of all health-related disability is directlydue to psychiatric disorders. The overall prevalence of psychiatric disorders in children is not as well documented as it is for adults. However, approximately 20% of chil-dren are estimated to have mental disorders with at least mild func-tional impairment. Children and adolescents with a serious emotional disturbance number approximately 5% to 9% of children ages 9 to 17 (New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003). Estimates suggest that approximately 20% of the older adult popu- lation have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder during a one-year period. This does not include cognitive impairments and dementias, the most122 Psychiatric-Mental Health A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope of Practice 7common being Alzheimer's disease (New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003). Considerable research now documents that mental health is the key to overall physical health and well-being (Fawzy et al., 1993; Sephton et al., 2000). Compelling evidence reports that up to 75% of all primary care visits can be attributed to psychosocial problems, including mood,anxiety, and substance-related disorders (New Freedom Commission onMental Health, 2003) and that mental health has a significant impact on clinical outcomes related to myocardial infarction, stroke (Whyte & Mulsant, 2002), cancer (Chochinov, 2001; Stark & House, 2000), and otherchronic diseases like diabetes (deGroot et al., 2001). Although the prevalence of psychiatric disorders did not significantly change between 1990-1992 (29.2%) and 2001-2003 (30.5%), the rate of treatment increased from 20.3% to 32.9% in the same period (Kessleret al., 2005), reflecting the expansion of primary care, managed care, andbehavioral \"carve-out\" programs for mental health services. Note, how- ever, that most people with psychiatric disorders still do not receive treatment for their disorder. Disparities Among Diverse Populations Data from the U.S. Census Bureau demonstrate significant changes inthe racial and ethnic composition of the U.S. population. The percent-age of non-Hispanic whites is projected to decrease from 70% in 2000 to 50% by 2050, with the greatest growth seen in Hispanic and Asian populations which are projected to double in the same period (U.S.Census Bureau, 2004). Although rates of mental illness in minoritypopulations are estimated to be similar to those in the white popula- tion, minorities are less likely to receive mental health services and are likely to receive services of poorer quality (U.S. DHHS, 2001). Efforts toimprove quality and access to mental health services for minority populations will include greater emphasis on developing cultural awareness and sensitivity among individual mental healthcare provid-ers and increasing cultural competence in healthcare organizations. This will entail promotion of linguistic competence, including utiliza- tion of bilingual staff, more effective and widespread use of transla-tion services, and redesign of written materials for persons with lowEnglish literacy.Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E Appendix A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. 8 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of PracticeStigma and barriers to accessible, effective, and coordinated treat- ment contribute to health disparities within the population (Institute of Medicine, 2005). Financial barriers include lack of parity in insurance coverage for psychiatric-mental health care and treatment, resulting in restrictions on the number and type of outpatient visits and number ofcovered inpatient days, and high co-pays for services. Changes in eligi-bility criteria for public insurance programs have contributed to an in- crease in the number of uninsured. Reductions in reimbursement have affected the number of clinicians willing or able to afford to provideservices at lower rates. Geographical barriers include lack of affordable, accessible public transportation in urban areas and lack of accessible clinical services in rural areas. Cultural issues, including lack of knowl-edge, fear, and stigma associated with mental illness, also constitute barriers to seeking help for mental health problems. These disparities occur at a time of growing evidence regarding ef- fective treatment of mental health problems and psychiatric disorders. Research evidence now supports the lifelong ability to influence thestructure and function of the brain (brain plasticity) through manipu- lation of environmental, interpersonal, and behavioral factors. The evi- dence to support clinical decision-making by psychiatric nurses andother mental health professionals continues to accumulate. Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing Leadership in Transforming the Mental Health System In the course of their practice, it is critical that psychiatric-mental health nurses consider the particular vision of mental health care that informs their practice. Federal agencies, commissions, and advocacy groups have identified a future vision of a mental healthcare system organized torespond to all consumers in need of services. These reports converge onseveral points, but most crucial is that a transformed mental health system is centered on the patient. Key to this vision are strategies for remedying the inadequacy and fragmentation of services and for cre-ating a workforce to carry out the transformation. There is particular em- phasis on providing services to children, adolescents, older adults, and other underserved populations. In leading the transformation of themental healthcare delivery system, psychiatric-mental health nurses must understand the key threads in the government/agency/consumer group plan and the factors that can affect enactment.124 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope of Practice 9Recovery is the lead principle of the transformation plans of the Sub- stance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, National Alli- ance for the Mentally Ill, National Council on Disabilities, the Institute of Medicine, and the President's New Freedom Commission. The recovery paradigm of mental health care emphasizes reawakening of hope, en-gagement in life, and empowerment over illness. Recovery is a criticalcomponent of psychosocial rehabilitation, which also focuses on help- ing individuals develop the skills they need to assume meaningful em- ployment, suitable housing, and interpersonal relationships (Anthonyet al., 2002). The person-centered recovery model supports an individualized and subjectively defined path to healing. It is an experience-based approach in which the process and outcome of recovery is defined and paced bythe individual. In this era of evidence-based practice, intervention is driven by objective outcomes data derived scientifically to support pre- scriptive approaches. This creates a tension that must be explored andnegotiated by psychiatric-mental health nurses; they must balance andintegrate the science of evidence-based treatment with a philosophi- cal understanding of how individuals attach meaning to experiences that shape their behavior and their treatment choices. With its ground-ing in the patient narrative, nursing is in an excellent position to maxi- mize and integrate standard patient outcomes with desired outcomes defined by the patient (Raingruber, 1999; & Macy, 2005). The transformation plan of the President's New Freedom Commission calls for community-level service systems that coordinate multiple agen- cies to provide care. These points of connection between agencies are vital to the realization of individualized recovery plans (SAMHSA, 2005). However, the notion of widespread outpatient community-based services runs contrary to the current trend of reduced funding for all forms of mental health treatment, including outpatient services (Manderscheid etal., 2004; Martin & Leslie, 2003; National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems, 2003). A person with a serious and persistent psychiatric disorder may in- deed move toward recovery with the assistance of interagency collabo- ration and assertive community treatment, but historically there hasbeen no guarantee that the infrastructure would enact the plan (Phillips et al., 2001). A review of the past demonstrates that complex casePsychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 125 Appendix A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. 10 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practicemanagement systems demand team leaders who are experienced, trained mental health professionals (Rapp, 1998), and that psychiatricnurses are a key agent for achieving positive patient outcomes in case management teams (McGrew & Bond, 1995). The transformed mental health system will require nurses who under- stand systems and can work between and within systems, connecting services and acting as an important safety net in the event of servicegaps. Psychiatric nurses are perfectly positioned to fill this role and make significant contributions to positive clinical recovery outcomes for the vulnerable, and often underserved, patient population. The mental health transformation plan in the President's New Free- dom Commission Report also calls for inclusion of the homeless, chil- dren, older adults, rural sector, and other underserved populations. Certainly an ideology of inclusion restores both equity and humanityto the system. But for many of these groups social problems are inex-tricably bound with emotional illness. A recent study of children with serious emotional disorder (SED) found that almost half had social, family, and educational issues as well(Pottick et al., 2002). Evidence related to psychiatric disorders in olderadults reveals high rates of co-morbid medical illness. Co-morbidity in the aged is a predictor of poorer response to mental health treatment, as well as a predictor of relapse (Hanrahan & Sullivan-Marx, 2005). More-over, despite a dramatic growth in evidence-based treatment for mental health problems in older adults, mental health service use is extremely low. Less than 3% of older adults receive outpatient mental health ser-vices, only 7% inpatient psychiatric services, and 9% private psychiatriccare (Persky, 1998). Nursing models for rural care are specifically designed to address the interplay of poverty, mental illness, and social issues (Hauenstein, 1997).Such nursing models recognize that resource-poor environmentsrequire service models with provisions for moving clients into self- management and for bridging systems so that medical issues are addressed. This nursing approach will be of significant importance incrafting individualized treatment plans for populations with tremen- dous physical and social needs inextricably bound with their mental health issues. The need for psychiatric nurses will be great because their command of multiple bodies of knowledge (medical science, neuro-126 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. biology of psychiatric disorders, treatment methods, and relationship science) positions them as the healthcare professionals best suited tomaintain the connection between psychiatry, medicine, and case man- agement systems (Hanrahan & Sullivan-Marx, 2005). Prevention Psychiatric-mental health nurses also lead prevention efforts. Armedwith the growing understanding of how stress and mental illness inter- act, psychiatric-mental health nurses educate the public on the ramifi-cations of stress and om stress reduction techniques (deVries & Wilkerson,2003). Increasingly, researchers are demonstrating the promise of pre- vention via intervention into sub-threshold symptoms (Kuijpers, Van Straten, & Smit, 2005). Nursing's traditional focus on primary prevention will fit nicely with this effort to treat mental conditions in early stages. The behaviors that place youth at risk are priority foci for prevention efforts. While traditional prevention foci (such as decreasing tobacco, alco- hol, and substance use) continue, increased attention is being directed to the effects of media and the Internet on teens' risk behaviors. Though youth spend, on average, three hours a day watching television and spend two hours online at least four times a week, little is known abouthow this media saturation shapes their normative behaviors and social interaction patterns (Escobar-Chaves et al., 2005). Depression in adoles- cence is an important focus for early identification and intervention(Draucker, 2005). School nurses, often the first contact with youth, already function as key mental health service providers, and their role in prevention should be strengthened and supported by the specialty. The Evolving Role of National Data Systems to Improve Quality Another key to the transformed mental healthcare system is consumerinput in determining the indicators used to gauge quality. The govern-ment is seeking to define and capture quality on the patient level viathe development of an information system, termed the DS2000 (Duffy et al., 2004). This system exemplifies the broad use of information tech- nology to capture not just quality data but provider data, cost, and out-comes. With its full implementation, decision support would link quality performance to quality outcomes and payment information. The hope is to establish a large data system that providers, mental health systems, Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope of Practice 11Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 127 Appendix A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. 12 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practiceand state planners could access to determine what works, at what cost, with what type of patient. Quality initiatives should be implemented in an integrated fashion, whereby clinicians are accountable for understanding and using tech- nology to build an evidence base for their practice. As clinicians, psychi- atric nurses must understand that technology is the vehicle for dataaccountability that will be used to gauge quality of care and to revisepolicy. Psychiatric nursing faculty members are in an excellent position to use technology in the educational process and thus create future clinicians who are fluent in its use (Carlson-Sabelli & Delaney, 2005;McGuiness & Noonan, 2004). Evidence-Based Practice and Lifelong Learning The transformed mental healthcare system will require a mental healthworkforce with additional characteristics. It is a workforce that must becomfortable with the use of technology in care delivery, able to oper- ate in teams, and fluent in the use of evidence-based practice (Stuart, Tondora, & Hoge, 2004). The transition to evidence-based practice has been rapid and not without its critics (Norcross, Beutler, & Levant, 2005). The use of the \"best available\" research evidence, coupled with expert clinical judgment and patient preferences, creates essential linkages among the patient, theprovider, the setting, and the science (Sackett, 2000). The key is that the person is not relegated to either extreme\u2014being a patient or a con- sumer\u2014and that evidence-based practices are always maintained in arelationship-based approach (Messer, 2006). Advances in genetics and innovative treatments for major mental ill- ness are the promise of the future (Kestenbaum, 2000). Psychiatric dis- orders occur as the result of complex interactions between genes, behavior, personality, and the environment. Estimates of genetic risk forpsychiatric disorders are the outcomes of population studies, twin stud- ies, adoption studies, first- and second-degree relatives (pedigree) studies, neuroimaging studies, and molecular linkage studies. Gene mapping in-volves the study of the interaction of multiple abnormal genes that aug- ment vulnerability to a specific psychiatric disorder (Pestka, 2003; Sapolsky, 2003). An earlier age of onset increases the likelihood of inheritability inselected disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.128 Psychiatric-Mental A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. Environmental factors and behavior influence the expression of the inheritable psychiatric disorders. Major stressful events such as an insult to the brain during fetal development, stress and trauma, medical illness, and illicit drug use can raise the risk for symptoms of the disorder to begin. Identification of and education about risk factors and strategiesfor lifestyle modifications is warranted when there is a high-risk familyhistory. Pharmacogenetics, which matches DNA variants such as fast or slow metabolizers to individualized pharmacological treatments, holds promise. Gene expression, gene therapy, and vaccines to alter geneticexpression are future tools to prevent or treat certain disorders. Psychiatric nursing leads in creating client-centered care based on the evidence related to the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders and the effects of medications, but it also constructs relationships within arecovery-based model (Forchuk et al., 2005). This demands a commit- ment to continuing professional development, lifelong learning, and a working knowledge of the current literature. Safety for Patients and for PMH Nurses While the transformed mental healthcare system is largely dedicated to the creation of new service structures, none of the agencies have lost sight of safety (Spear, 2005). Especially pertinent to nursing practice aresafety issues surrounding restraint and information that error and mor- tality rates can be tied to nurse-patient ratios. As scrutiny of safety and errors continues, nurses have assumed key roles in designing studies onthe relationship of nursing, staffing, and patient safety. They must alsomaintain roles consistent with their direct care position, anticipate sys- tems errors, and employ preventive safety measures. In the inpatient arena, psychiatric nurses, as managers of the milieu, must move thesafety agenda beyond reducing restraint to a studied approach of how to create safe units, both physical and psychological, and develop, mea- sure, and evaluate key systems and staffing factors that result in reduc-tions in restraint, violence, and other threats to patient safety (Johnson & Delaney, 2006; Delaney, 2005). Definition of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing Nursing's Social Policy Statement (ANA, 2003) defines nursing as \"the pro- tection, promotion, and optimization of health and abilities, prevention Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope of Practice 13Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 129 Appendix A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. 14 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practiceof illness and injury, alleviation of suffering through the diagnosis and treatment of human response, and advocacy in the care of individuals,families, communities, and populations.\" Psychiatric-mental health nursing is a specialized area of nursing prac- tice committed to promoting mental health through the assessment,diagnosis, and treatment of human responses to mental health prob-lems and psychiatric disorders. Psychiatric-mental health nursing, a coremental health profession, employs a purposeful use of self as its art and a wide range of nursing, psychosocial, and neurobiological theories and research evidence as its science. Psychiatric-mental health nurses pro-vide comprehensive, patient-centered mental health and psychiatric care in a variety of settings across the continuum of care. Essential com- ponents of this specialty practice include health and wellness promo-tion through identification of mental health issues, prevention of mental health problems, care of mental health problems, and treatment of per- sons with psychiatric disorders. It is within the scope of psychiatric-mental health nursing practice to provide mental health care to patients seeking mental health servicesin a wide range of delivery settings. Mental health care involves overall health promotion, universal, selective, and preventive interventions (Mrazek & Hagerty, 1994), general health teaching, health screening andappropriate referral for treatment of general or complex health prob- lems, and a specialization in the evaluation and management of those with psychiatric disorders and those at risk for them, including psychi-atric rehabilitation (Haber & Billings, 1995). The psychiatric nurse's assessment synthesizes information obtained from interviews, behavioral observations, and other available data. From these, the psychiatric nurse determines diagnoses or problem state- ments that are congruent with available and accepted classification sys-tems and develops a treatment plan based on assessment data and theoretical premises. The nurse then selects and implements interven- tions and periodically evaluates patient outcomes, revising the plan ofcare as needed, to achieve optimal results. Use of standardized classifi- cation systems enhances communication and permits the data to be used for research. Mental health problems and psychiatric disorders are addressed across a continuum of care. A continuum of care consists of an inte-130 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. grated system of settings, services, healthcare clinicians, and care levels spanning states from illness to wellness. The primary goal of a con-tinuum of care is to provide treatment that allows the patient to achieve the highest level of functioning in the least restrictive environment. Psychiatric-mental health advanced practice nursing involves the delivery of comprehensive primary mental health care in a variety of settings. Primary mental health care is defined as the continuous andcomprehensive services necessary for the promotion of optimal health; the prevention of mental illness; health maintenance; management of, and referral for, mental and physical health problems; the diagnosis andtreatment of psychiatric disorders and their sequelae, and rehabilitation (Haber & Billings, 1995). Psychiatric-mental health nursing is necessarily holistic and considers the needs and strengths of the individual, family,group, and community. Phenomena of Concern for Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses Phenomena of concern for psychiatric-mental health nurses include: Promotion of optimal mental and physical health and well-being and prevention of mental illness. Impaired ability to function related to psychiatric, emotional, and physiological distress. Alterations in thinking, perceiving, and communicating due to psy- chiatric disorders or mental health problems. Behaviors and mental states that indicate potential danger to self or others. Emotional stress related to illness, pain, disability, and loss. Symptom management, side effects or toxicities associated with self-administered drugs, psychopharmological intervention, and other treatment modalities. The barriers to treatment efficacy and recovery posed by alcohol and substance abuse and dependence. Self-concept and body image changes, developmental issues, life process changes, and end-of-life issues. Physical symptoms that occur along with altered psychological status.

Societal factors such as violence, poverty, and substance abuse. Levels of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing Practice Psychiatric-mental health nurses are registered nurses who are educa-tionally prepared in nursing and licensed to practice in their individual states. Levels of practice are differentiated by educational preparation, complexity of practice, and performance of certain nursing functions(SERPN, 2005). Psychiatric-Mental Health Registered Nurse (RN-PMH) A Psychiatric-Mental Health Registered Nurse (RN-PMH) is a registerednurse who demonstrates competence, including specialized knowledge,skills, and abilities, obtained through education and experience in caring for persons with mental health issues, mental health problems, and psy- chiatric disorders. Nurses from a number of educational backgrounds participate and practice in psychiatric nursing settings. Due to the complexity of care in the specialty, the preferred educational preparation is at the bacca- laureate level with credentialing by the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC). The science of nursing is based on a critical thinking framework, known as the nursing process, composed of assessment, diagnosis, out- comes identification, planning, implementation, and evaluation. These steps serve as the foundation for clinical decision-making and are usedto provide an evidence base for practice (ANA, 2004). Psychiatric-mental health registered nursing practice is characterized by the use of the nursing process to treat people with actual or potential132 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. mental health problems or psychiatric disorders to: promote and foster health and safety; assess dysfunction; assist persons to regain or improvetheir coping abilities; maximize strengths; and prevent further disability. Data collection at the point of contact involves observational and inves- tigative activities, which are guided by the nurse's knowledge of humanbehavior and the principles of the psychiatric interviewing process. The data may include but is not limited to the patient's: Central complaint, focus, or concern and symptoms of major psy- chiatric disorders. History and presentation regarding suicidal, violent, and self-mu- tilating behaviors. History of reliability with regard to patient's verbal agreement to seek professional assistance before engaging in behaviors danger- ous to self or others. Pertinent family history of psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, and other mental and relevant physical health issues. Evidence of abuse, neglect, or trauma. Stressors, contributing factors, and coping strategies. Demographic profile and history of health patterns, illnesses, past treatments, and level of adherence and effectiveness of those in treatment. Actual or potential barriers to adherence to recommended or pre- scribed treatment. Health beliefs and practices. Method of communication. Religious and spiritual beliefs and practices. Cultural, racial, and ethnic identity and practices. Physical, developmental, cognitive, mental status, emotional health concerns, and neurological assessment. Daily activities, personal hygiene, occupational functioning, func- tional health status, and social roles. Work, sleep, and sexual functioning. Economic, political, legal, and environmental factors affecting health.

Medication interactions and history of side effects and past efficacy. Allergies and other adverse reactions. History and patterns of alcohol and substance abuse, including type, amount, most recent use, and withdrawal symptoms. Complementary therapies used to treat health and mental illness and their outcomes. The work of psychiatric-mental health registered nurses is accom- plished through the nurse-client relationship, therapeutic intervention skills, and professional attributes. These attributes include but are not limited to self awareness, empathy, and moral integrity, which enablepsychiatric-mental health nurses to practice the artful use of self intherapeutic relationships. Some characteristics of artful therapeutic practice are respect for the client, availability, spontaneity, hope, accep- tance, sensitivity, vision, accountability, advocacy, and spirituality. Psychiatric-mental health registered nurses practice in a variety of clinical settings across the care continuum and engage in a broad array of clinical activities including, but not limited to, health promotion and health maintenance; intake screening, evaluation, and triage; case man-agement; provision of therapeutic and safe environments; promotion of self-care activities; administration of psychobiological treatment regi- mens and monitoring response and effects; crisis intervention and sta- bilization; and psychiatric rehabilitation. Psychiatric-mental health registered nurses play a significant role in the articulation and implementation of new paradigms of care and treatment that place the patient at the center of the care delivery sys- tem. They are key members of interdisciplinary teams in implementing initiatives such as seclusion and restraint reduction or elimination,134 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. patient involvement in treatment planning processes, and skill-building programs to assist patients to achieve their own goals. Psychiatric-mental health registered nurses maintain current knowl- edge of advances in genetics and neuroscience and their impact on psychopharmocology and other treatment modalities. In partnership with patients, communities, and other health professionals, psychiatric-mental health nurses provide leadership in identifying mental healthissues, and in developing strategies to ameliorate or prevent them. Psychiatric-Mental Health Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN-PMH) The Psychiatric-Mental Health Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN-PMH) is a licensed registered nurse who is educationally pre- pared at the master's or doctorate level in the specialty of psychiatric-mental health nursing and holds advanced practice specialty certification from ANCC. The APRN-PMH expands the practice of a registered nurse by demonstrating a greater depth and breadth of knowledge, a greatersynthesis of data, increased complexity of skills and interventions, andsignificant role autonomy (ANA, 2004). The American Nurses Association (ANA) defines Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) as professional nurses who have successfullycompleted a graduate program of study in a nursing specialty that pro-vides specialized knowledge and skills that form the foundation for ex- panded roles in health care. The full scope and standards of practice for psychiatric-mental health advanced practice nursing are set forth in this document. While individual APRN-PMHs may actually implement portions of the full scope and prac-tice based on their role, position description, and practice setting, it is, importantly, the full breadth of the knowledge base that informs their practice. APRN-PMH practice focuses on the application of competencies, knowledge, and experience to individuals, families, or groups with com- plex psychiatric-mental health problems. Promoting mental health in society is a significant role for the APRN-PMH, as is collaboration withand referral to other health professionals as either the patient's need or the APRN-PMH's practice focus may dictate. The scope of practice in psychiatric-mental health nursing is continu- ally expanding as the context of practice, the need for patient access to Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope of Practice 19Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 135 Appendix A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. 20 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practiceholistic care, and the various scientific and nursing knowledge bases evolve. It is within the scope of practice of the APRN-PMH to provideprimary mental health care to patients seeking mental health services in a wide range of delivery settings. APRN-PMHs are accountable for functioning within the parameters of their education and training, andthe scope of practice as defined by their state practice acts. APRN-PMHsare responsible for making referrals for health problems that are outside their scope of practice. Although many primary care clinicians treat some symptoms of mental health problems and psychiatric disorders,the APRN-PMH provides a full range of comprehensive services that constitute primary mental health and psychiatric care and treatment. APRN-PMHs are professionally qualified to assume responsibility for clinical functions. They are accountable for their own practice and are prepared to perform services independent of other disciplines in the full range of delivery settings. The educational preparation of advanced practice psychiatric-mental health nurses in both the biological andsocial sciences gives them a unique ability to differentiate various as-pects of the patient's functioning and to make appropriate judgments and decisions about the need for interventions, referral, or consultation with other clinicians (ANA, 2004). Additional functions of the APRN-PMH include prescribing psycho- pharmacological agents, integrative therapy interventions, various forms of psychotherapy, community interventions, case management, consul- tation and liaison, clinical supervision, expanded advocacy activities,education, and research. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy interventions include all generally accepted methods ofbrief or long-term therapy, specifically including individual therapy,group therapy, marital or couple therapy, and family therapy using a range of therapy models including, but not limited to, insight-oriented, cognitive, behavioral, and interpersonal therapies to produce change orsupportive therapy to maintain function. Psychotherapy denotes a formally structured relationship between the therapist (APRN-PMH) and the patient for the explicit purpose ofeffecting negotiated outcomes. This treatment approach to mentaldisorders is intended to alleviate emotional distress or symptoms, to136 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. reverse or change maladaptive behaviors, and to facilitate personal growth and development. The contract with the patient or client is usu-ally verbal but may be written. It includes well accepted elements such as purpose of the therapy, time, place, fees, confidentiality and privacy provisions, and emergency after-hours contact information. Psychopharmacological Interventions Psychopharmacological interventions include the prescribing or recom-mending of pharmacologic agents and the ordering and interpretation of diagnostic and laboratory testing. In utilizing any psychobiological intervention, including the prescribing of psychoactive medications, theAPRN-PMH intentionally seeks specific therapeutic responses, antici- pates common side effects, safeguards against adverse drug inter- actions, and is alert for unintended or toxic responses. Case Management Case management by the APRN-PMH involves population-specific nurs- ing knowledge coupled with research, knowledge of the social and legal systems related to mental health, and expertise to engage a wide rangeof services for the patient, regardless of setting. The APRN-PMH mayoversee or directly engage in case management activities. The APRN- PMH analyzes barriers to care and intervenes to change or improve systems to mobilize therapeutic resources needed by the patient for op-timum outcomes. Case management activities may be with a single client or with a designated population such as the seriously and persis- tently mentally ill. Program Development and Management In the community, the APRN-PMH may focus on the mental health needs of the population as a whole. The APRN-PMH may design programs to meet the mental health needs of a population (such as the seriously andpersistently mentally ill) or to target a population at risk for developingmental health problems through health and wellness promotion, iden- tification and amelioration of risk factors, screening, and early interven- tion. These activities are informed by the full range of nursingknowledge which includes a holistic approach to individuals, families, and communities that is cognizant and respectful of cultural and spiri- tual norms and values. Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope of Practice 21Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 137 Appendix A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. 22 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of PracticeConsultation and Liaison Consultation and liaison activities take place in general (non-psychiatric) healthcare arenas such as hospitals, extended care facilities, rehabilita- tion centers, schools, nursing homes, and outpatient clinics. The consul- tation and liaison role of the psychiatric-mental health nurse centers on providing mental health specialist consultation or direct care psychiatric-mental health nursing services. The clinical aspect of the role ranges from mental health promotion to illness rehabilitation. In consultation and liaison activities, the APRN- PMH concentrates on the emotional, spiritual, developmental, cognitive, and behavioral responses of patients who enter any setting of thehealthcare system with actual or potential physiological dysfunction (patient-centered consultation). The psychiatric-mental health consul- tation may include consultee-centered consultation with nurses andclinicians in other specialty areas to increase their biopsychosocial knowledge and skills. Such consultation may also assist consultees to recognize and manage their own reactions to patients that couldadversely affect their patient care if undetected and unaddressed.Psychiatric-mental health consultation may also include assessment and recommendations for action when the healthcare delivery organization is the client (administrative consultation) (Caplan & Caplan, 1993). Clinical Supervision The APRN-PMH provides clinical supervision to assist other mentalhealth clinicians to expand their clinical practice skills, to meet the stan-dard requirement for ongoing peer consultation, and for essential peer supervision. This process is aimed at professional growth and develop- ment rather than staff performance evaluation. Through education,preparation, and clinical experience, the APRN-PMH is qualified to pro-vide clinical supervision at the request of other mental health clinicians and clinician-trainees. As a clinical supervisor, the APRN-PMH is expected both to be involved in direct patient care and to serve as a clinical role model and a clinical consultant. APRN-PMH nurses providing clinical supervision must be aware of the potential for impaired professional objectivity or exploitation when theyhave dual or multiple relationships with the supervisee or patients. Thenurse should avoid providing clinical supervision for people with whomthey have pre-existing relationships that could hinder objectivity. Nurses138 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. who provide clinical supervision maintain the confidentiality of staff and patients, except as is required for evaluation and necessary reporting. Ethical Issues in Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing Psychiatric-mental health registered nurses adhere to all aspects ofCode of Ethics for Nurses with Interpretive Statements (ANA, 2001). The psychiatric-mental health registered nurse monitors and carefully man-ages therapeutic self-disclosure. The nurse demonstrates a commitmentto practicing self-care, managing stress, nurturing self, and maintaining supportive relationships with others so that the nurse is meeting their own needs outside of the therapeutic relationship. The psychiatric-mental health registered nurse is always cognizant of the responsibil- ity to balance patient rights with patient safety and the potential need for coercive practices (e.g., restrictive measures such as restraint or se- clusion), or forced treatment (e.g., court-mandated treatment, mental hy- giene arrest for an emergent psychiatric evaluation) when the patient lacks the ability to maintain their own safety. The psychiatric-mental health registered nurse helps resolve ethical issues of patients, col-leagues, or systems as evidenced in such activities as consulting with and serving on ethics committees. Specialized Areas of Practice Specialty programs in psychiatric-mental health nursing generally focus on adult or child-adolescent psychiatric-mental health nursing, and cer- tifications are currently available for these two specialties. Areas of fo- cus within psychiatric-mental health nursing have emerged based oncurrent and anticipated societal needs. These areas may be organizedaccording to a developmental period (geriatric), a specific mental or emotional disorder (depression, severe and persistent mental illness, developmental disability), a particular practice focus (forensics, addic- tions, community, family, couple, individual), or a specific role or func- tion (case management, consultation and liaison). Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing Clinical Practice Settings The settings and arrangements for psychiatric-mental health nursing practice vary widely in purpose, type, and location, and in the auspices Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope of Practice 23Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 139 Appendix A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. 24 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practiceunder which they are operated. Psychiatric-mental health nurses may work in organized settings and may be paid for their services on a sala-ried, contractual, or fee-for-service basis. In addition, the APRN-PMH may be self-employed or employed by an agency, practice autonomously or collaboratively, and bill clients for services provided. Today, because of the advances in brain research and pharmacological treatments, as well as the current focus on cost-effective treatment, mostclients in need of mental health services are cared for in community settings. Acute, intermediate, and long-term care settings still admit and care for psychiatric patients but lengths of stay, especially in acute andintermediate settings, have decreased in response to fiscal mandates, the availability of community-based settings, and consumer preference. Crisis Intervention and Psychiatric Emergency Services Crisis intervention units may be found in the emergency department of a general or psychiatric hospital or within centers in the community. Patients in crisis demonstrate severe symptoms and require a high in- tensity of nursing services. Acute Inpatient Care This setting involves the most intensive care and is reserved for acutelyill patients who are at high risk for harming themselves or others, or are unable to care for their basic needs. This treatment is often short-term. These units may be in a psychiatric hospital, a general hospital, or a pub-licly funded psychiatric facility or program. Intermediate and Long-Term Care Intermediate and long-term care facilities may admit patients but moreoften they receive patients transferred from acute care settings. Inter-mediate and long-term care provides treatment and rehabilitation forpatients who are at chronic risk for harming themselves or others due to mental illness. Long-term inpatient care usually involves a minimum of three months. Both public and private psychiatric facilities providethis type of care. Partial Hospitalization and Intensive Outpatient Treatment The aim of partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient programs isacute symptom stabilization for patients with safe housing options or140 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. employment. Partial hospitalization may also serve as a step down for patients discharged from an inpatient unit. Residential Services A residential facility provides care for patients over a twenty-four-hour period. Services in typical residential treatment facilities include psycho-education around symptom management and medications, assistancewith vocational training, and, in the case of the severely and persistently mentally ill, may include training for activities of daily living. Rehabilita- tion is often a goal for residential treatment facilities. Community-Based Care Psychiatric-mental health registered nurses provide care within the com- munity as an effective method of responding to the mental health needsof individuals, families, and groups. Community-based care refers to caredelivered in partnership with patients in their homes, work sites, mental health clinics and programs, health maintenance organizations, shelters and clinics for the homeless, crisis centers, senior centers, group homes,and other community settings. Schools and colleges are important sites of mental health promotion, primary prevention, and early intervention programs for children and youth that involve psychiatric-mental healthregistered nurses. Psychiatric-mental health registered nurses are involved in educating teachers, parents, and students about mental health issues and in efforts such as depression screening. They may also provide mentalhealth assessments and psychiatric services to students. Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) The Assertive Community Treatment model is an interdisciplinary teamapproach to the care of people with severe mental illness; it providesservices in the individual's natural setting, including homeless shelters. ACT provides a comprehensive range of treatments. The goals of ACT are to help patients meet the requirements of community living afterdischarge from another more restricted form of care, and to reduce re- currences of hospitalization. Primary Care Because of recent changes in the healthcare system, primary care set- tings have assumed increasing importance in treating mental disorders. Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope of Practice 25Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2E 141 Appendix A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. 26 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of PracticeDepression is now more likely to be treated in primary care than in spe- cialty mental health settings (Olfson et al., 2002). Psychiatric-mentalhealth registered nurses provide mental health services in primary care via several models: consultation: the APRN-PMH functions as an expert resource for primary care providers; provision: patients are referred to an APRN-PMH affiliated with the primary care setting; integrated: APRN-PMHs who have additional training in primary care provide a mixture of psychiatric and primary care services; and collaborative: a network of primary care and mental health provid- ers collaboratively manage a group of patients. Psychiatric-mental health nurses at both the RN and APRN level partici- pate in large-scale initiatives to improve the quality of depression care in primary care settings (Koike, Unutzer, & Wells, 2002). Integrative Programs Integrative programs provide simultaneous care for co-occurring sub- stance use disorders and serious mental health disorders by a team oftrained professionals. Services include assertive outreach, comprehen- sive services, and shared decision-making with staff, patients, and pa- tients' families. Treatment progresses in stages from engagement intreatment to relapse prevention, incorporating a long-term commit-ment to services and pharmacological interventions. Sustained re- mission rates from substance use, lower rates of victimization, longer retention in treatment, and less time in the hospital are outcomes of integrated treatment for co-occurring disorders. Levels of care are de- termined by the severity of the substance use disorder and the sever- ity of the mental illness. Those with the most severe disorders may betreated in specialized residential treatment centers or modified thera- peutic communities. Telehealth Telehealth is the use of telecommunications technology to remove time and distance barriers from the delivery of healthcare services and re-lated healthcare activities. It is an expanded means of communication142 Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, A: Psychiatric-Mental health nursing: scoPe and s tandards of Practice (2007) this appendix is not current and is of historical significance only. that promotes access to health care. The psychiatric-mental health reg- istered nurse may use electronic means of communication such as tele-phone consultation, computers, electronic mail, image transmission, and interactive video sessions to establish and maintain a therapeutic rela- tionship with patients by creating an alternative sense of the nursingpresence that may or may not occur in \"real time\" . Psychiatric-mentalhealth nursing care in telehealth incorporates practice and clinical guidelines that are based on empirical evidence and professional con- sensus. Telehealth encounters raise special issues related to confidenti-ality and regulation. Telehealth technology can cross state and even national boundaries and must be practiced in accordance with all ap- plicable state, federal, and international laws and regulations. Particularattention must be directed to confidentiality, informed consent, docu- mentation, maintenance of records, and the integrity of the transmitted information. Self-Employment Self-employed psychiatric-mental health advanced practice nurses offer direct services in solo private practice and group practice set- tings, or through contracts with employee assistance programs, healthmaintenance organizations, managed care companies, preferred pro- vider organizations, industry health departments, home healthcare agencies, or other service delivery arrangements. In these settings, theAPRN-PMH provides primary mental health care to clients in the nurse's caseload. In the consultation and liaison role, the APRN-PMH may also contract for consultation services directed at either the needsof the organization and its staff or the needs of patients in a varietyof healthcare settings (nursing homes, medical units, home health care). Self-employed nurses may also form nurse-owned corporations or organizations that would provide mental health service contractsto industries or employers. Forensic Mental Health Recent studies have noted the high rates of mental illness in jails andprisons. APRN-PMHs perform psychiatric assessments, prescribe and administer psychiatric medications, and educate correctional officers about mental health issues. They are also involved in providing thera-peutic services to witnesses or victims of crime.

Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2nd Edition . Silver Spring, MD: Nursesbooks.org.ANA Standards of Psychiatric-Mental Health ANA, APNA, and ISPNhttp://www.ispn-psych.org/ http://www.apna.org/About ANA's Specialty Nursing Standards Since the late 1990s, ANA has partnered with other nursing organizations to establish a formal process for recognition of specialty areas of nursing practice. This includes the criteria for approving the specialty itself and the scope statement, and an acknowledgment by ANA of the standards of practice for that specialty. Because of the signicant changes in the evolving nursing and healthcare environments, ANA's approval of specialty nursing scope statements and its acknowledgment of specialty standards of practice remain valid for ve years, starting from the publication date of the documents. The standards in this publication are based on language from ANA's Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, Second Edition , a helpful supplement to this specialty text, which in turn is of optimal use with two complementary ANA texts: Nursing's Social Policy Statement: The Essence of the Profession and Guide to the Code of Ethics for Nurses: Interpretation and Application . These three books are also available as a set, ANA's Foundation of Nursing Package, to guide nursing practice, thinking, and decision-making. The set is proving useful as a professional reference, classroom textbook, in-service training guide, and credentialing exam resource. For more on these publications, go to www.Nursesbooks.org.Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing SCOPE AND STANDARDS OF PRACTICE 2ND EDITION Psychiatric-mental health (PMH) nursing is the nursing practice specialty committed to promoting mental health through the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of behavioral problems, mental disorders, and comorbid conditions across the lifespan. PMH nursing intervention employs a purposeful use of self and a wide range of nursing, psychosocial, and neurobiological evidence to produce effective outcomes. The American Psychiatric Nurses Association and the International Society of Psychiatric Mental-Health Nurses convened a task force of nurse experts from across their practice to review and revise Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, published in 2007. With input from across the nursing profession that was facilitated by ANA, the task force developed this all-new edition . It is the denitive and up-to-date delineation of psychiatric-mental health nursing, articulating the competent level of nursing practice and professional performance of all PMH registered nurses, whatever their practice level or setting. The publication's scope of practice addresses what is expected of all psychiatric- mental health nurses, specifying the who, what, where, when, why, and how of their practice. The detailed discussion of that scope of practice provides the context needed to understand and use the standards, presenting the underlying assumptions, characteristics, environments and settings, education and training requirements, key issues and trends, and ethical and conceptual bases of the specialty. The standards themselves are authoritative statements that describe the responsibilities by which psychiatric-mental health nurses are held accountable in their practice. Each standard is measurable by a set of specic competencies that serve as evidence of minimal compliance with that standard. While this foundational volume is primarily for those directly involved with psychiatric-mental health nursing practice, education, and research, other nursing and allied healthcare providers, researchers, and scholars will nd value in this content. In addition, it is a resource for employers, insurers, lawyers, policy makers, regulators, and stakeholders.For more information about Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, scan this QR code. 8515 Georgia Avenue, Suite 400 "}
