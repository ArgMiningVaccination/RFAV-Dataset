A collaborative process that allows patients and theirproviders to make health care decisions together, considering: The best scientific evidence available, as well as the patient's values and preferences. Including treatment or no treatment Includes information exchange, deliberation, and decision making When to use SDM in my practice? In preference sensitive situations-new diagnosis: When conditional clinical guidelines exist Change in disease prognosis or progression Change in health status Clinical trials Screening tests and preventative strategies Life changes that may alter patient's priorities (family, partners, caregiver support) Challenges to SDM in Asthma Most clinicians (80%) think they are doing it; while recent study suggest patient believe SDM to be done under 20% of the time. Clinicians having access to the latest evidence-based knowledge Most clinicians and their staff have limited training in Shared Decision-Making and motivational interviewing.

He needs facts as well as consider his needs ,values ,what he hopes for in best outcome for him Alex is never alone, has family and clinicians as support through active listening Alex prepares for future appointments by using other SDM Tools prior to or during subsequent visits SDM is process not one and doneActivating and Engaging Alex in his care decisions Engaging Alex and his Family in SDM Key Messages-Use SDM Tools/Aids Shared decision making will improve Alex's health care quality, but risk communication to Alex and his family can pose a challenge to efficient implementation. Asthma treatment risk perception (HCP and patient) can be influenced by recency bias, professional training, numeracy, and geography. SDM Tools to improve risk communication include providing numeric (not just descriptive) likelihoods of risk and benefits, using absolute (not just relative) risks, incorporating pictograms, reducing cognitive overload, and keeping risk in perspective of everyday hazards. Variation of patient preferences for nonallergic health states measured under conditions of risk is not well characterized but can significantly affect the health and economic outcomes of many allergy therapies. Challenges to incorporating shared decision making into Alex's treatment choice include the need to develop, validate, maintain, index, and update patient decision aids as well as understand how to efficiently use these tools in clinical practice. Shaker M, et al. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. September 2020;125(3):252-261 Risk Communication Should Incorporate Information Alex and his Family Need to Effectively Make Decisions at the Point of Care Shaker M, et al. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. September 2020;125(3):252-2612/28/2023 6 Asthma Shared Decision-Making in the Care of Alex and his Family Shared decision-making is a patient-centered approach that involves a mutual discussion about management or treatment options, which account for the patient's underlying values and preferences for therapy. This process is meant to help clarify the patient's values regarding their options, but not instill the clinician's values or preferences into that choice. Decision support tools, such as decision aids, are useful instruments to assist patients in the values clarification process, to help find congruence between decisions and personal values. Preference-sensitive care exists in which there are multiple treatment/management options each with significant tradeoffs and varying outcomes, in which the decision to choose 1 option is reflective of personal values and preferences. Asthma has multiple potentially preference-sensitive care scenarios. Involving especially early biologics and as needed ICS/LABA therapy. Only 1 decision aid exists for the choice of asthma treatment. More are needed. Greenhawt M. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. September 2020;125(3):262-267 A Review of Shared Decision-Making Key Messages Shared decision-making (SDM) is a patient-centered process of communication between health care providers and patients to arrive at optimal care decisions that recognize patient preference. Quality SDM tools and aids are clear and evidence-based, with accurate and unbiased information that outlines the risks and benefits of each intervention. Correct population As of now, SDM is required by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid for some interventions. Notably, SDM is the preferred tool for the care of Alex because it involves the patient and family with the assistance of the health care providers. Bukstein DA, et al. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. September 2020;125(3):273-279 Documented Effects of Validated Decision Tools that could be used with Alex and his family Increased patient involvement Improved patient knowledge Increased realistic perception of outcomes Improved informed values-based choices (pertains to decision aids with explicit values - clarification exercises) Positively affect patient-practitioner communication Have a variable effect on length of consultation with healthcare providers Allow Alex and his families values and preferences to be taken into consideration2/28/2023 7 Contact MeDon donabukstein@gmail.com Website: https://sdmcentral.com/Feel free to reach out with more questions.
