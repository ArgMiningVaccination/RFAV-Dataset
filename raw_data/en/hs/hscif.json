The Stein Eye Institute is a proud affiliate of the Doheny Eye Institute.LETTER FROM THE CHAIR To have 20/20 vision is to see clearly, and for the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology, the year 2020 heralds in both a new decade and a focus on our mission to preserve sight and end avoidable blindness. Research is core to this aim, and in this issue of EYE Magazine, we highlight basic scientists in the UCLA Stein Eye Institute's Vision Science Division who are studying the fundamental mechanisms of visual function and using that knowledge to define, identify, and ultimately cure eye disease. Clinical research trials are also underway at Stein Eye and the Doheny Eye Centers UCLA, and include the first in-human trial of autologous cultivated limbal cell therapy to treat limbal stem cell deficiency, a blinding corneal disease; evaluation of an investiga- tional medication to treat graft-versus-host disease, a potentially serious complication after transplant procedures; comparison of drug-delivery systems to determine which is most effective for treatment of diabetic macular edema; and analysis of regenerative strategies for treatment of age-related macular degeneration. UCLA Department of Ophthalmology award-winning researchers conduct investigations of depth and magnitude, and the Depart - ment has taken a central role in transforming vision science as a powerful platform for discovery. I thank our faculty and staff for their sight-saving endeavors, and I thank you, our donors and friends, for supporting our scientific explorations. Sincerely, Bartly J. Mondino, MD Bradley R.

Photo: Robin Weisz EYE | UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE | SPRING 20202When Emily, a 15-year-old girl, complained of sensitivity to light and blurriness in the center of her vision, she was referred to the UCLA Stein Eye Institute by her family doctor, who suspected that the symptoms indicated more than routine issues with her sight. Examination and testing at Stein Eye confirmed the problem: Emily had Stargardt disease, an inherited condition that eventually leads to progressive damage of the macula, the area in the mid - dle of the retina. As a result, patients with Stargardt disease eventually lose their central eyesight, eliminating their ability to read, recognize faces, or perform other activities of daily life. Stargardt disease is a genetic disorder, a condition caused by the defect in a single gene (see related story) . Although the cause of Stargardt disease is known and its progress can be slowed somewhat, no effective long-term treatment or cure yet exists. Stargardt disease represents only one of many conditions that are the focus of basic research at the Institute on the most fundamental issues affecting the eye, and investigations at Stein Eye have produced significant progress in finding the key to Stargardt disease\u2014work that may one day lead to a cure. Basic research at the Institute also builds understanding in a broad range of issues involving the central processes in the eye\u2014how it functions normally, and how it can fail\u2014as UCLA Department of Ophthalmology scholars work to define, identify, and ultimately cure eye disease. Fundamental research at the Stein Eye Institute's Vision Science Division is building knowledge about a broad range of issues involving the central processes in the eye\u2014how it functions normally, and how it can fail\u2014as UCLA Department of Ophthalmology scholars work to define, identify, and ultimately cure eye disease.EYE | UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE | SPRING 20203\"Studying the origins and progression of eye diseases such as Stargardt is at the core of our work in the basic sciences,\" says Alapakkam P. Sampath, PhD , associate director of the Stein Eye Institute and chief of the Vision Science Division. \"Our goal in the Division,\" says Dr. Sam - path, \"is to identify the fundamental mech - anisms of visual function, use that knowl - edge to better understand specific diseases, and explore how to correct them.\" Basic research in the Institute's Vision Science Division is conducted in 19 spe - cialized laboratories involving Stein Eye faculty, graduate students, residents, and staff, often working in collaboration with other faculty from the David Geffen School of Medicine and throughout UCLA. \"All faculty in the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology are involved in some aspects of vision research,\" says Bartly J. Mondino, MD , chair of the Department and director of the Stein Eye Institute. \"For example, many of our faculty conduct clin - ical research, which looks at the range of issues that relate directly to human care, such as the effectiveness of drugs or pro - cedures ( see related story ). But a core group of our scholars conducts basic research that explores the eye at its most funda - mental level.\" Looking at the principal mechanisms of vision \"Basic research in the Vision Science Divi - sion studies the central functions within the eye,\" says Dr. Sampath. \"Studying how the eye works at its most primary levels opens opportunities to understand the molec - ular or genetic issues that can destroy sight, and how we can create therapies to recover vision.\" \"As scientists involved in core research,\" says Dr. Sampath, \"we are asking how cells in the eye contribute to our visual expe - rience: how do they work under natural conditions? What are the molecules that contribute to this function? And even more important, in patients that suffer from a variety of types of visual loss\u2014how are those proteins malfunctioning?\"Progression from largest to smallest Within the Vision Science Division, ongoing research explores all of the major elements of sight. The eye deserves such close atten - tion; what might appear to be a relatively simple orb is actually a profoundly com - plex organ unlike any other in the human body\u2014a machine that in addition to its pri - mary functions of capturing and recording visual information, manages itself with its own circulating chemicals, waste disposal, and nourishment. \"Research in the Department crosses all levels of the eye, from the front of the lens to the back where the retina forms the optic nerve that continues into the brain,\" says Gabriel H. Travis, MD , Charles Kenneth Feldman Chair in Ophthalmology and pro - fessor of ophthalmology. \"The eye is an ideal model for core research on the human body,\" says Dr. Travis. \"Humans are very visual animals; when something goes wrong in the eye, it's usually a big problem and we notice it immediately. And many elements of the workings of the eye can be closely observed in living patients.\"\"Our goal in the Division is to identify the fundamental mechanisms of visual function, use that knowledge to better understand specific diseases, and explore how to correct them.\" ALAPAKKAM P. SAMPATH, PHD Chief of the Vision Science Division EYE | UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE | SPRING 20204Stein Eye investigators pursue basic research on the eye at different scales, from the workings of tissues and cells, down to the operation of molecules within those cells, and\u2014at the most fundamental\u2014the purpose of specific genes and how they control normal functions within the eye, or the origins of defects and malfunc - tions when they fail. \"So what makes one labo - ratory different from another is two things: which part of the visual process are they working on, and what level of the eye they are explor - ing,\" says Dr. Sampath. For instance, Dr. Sam - path conducts research to understand the molec - ular mechanisms under - lying visual processing\u2014 in particular, the processes involved in the sensitivity of night vision. In the laboratory of Suraj P. Bhat, PhD , Oppen - heimer Brothers Chair* and pro - fessor of ophthalmology, researchers study the fiber cells of the lens, and how the unique position of each cell in the lens contributes to vision clarity when function - ing normally, or promotes cataracts when malfunctioning . But regardless of the level of basic research, a key issue is identifying the origins of a disease or defect before it expresses itself with symptoms or illness. \"Working to model a disease from the earliest possible time in its development is precisely what we are focusing on in the lab,\" says Roxana A. Radu, MD , assistant professor of ophthalmology. \"We want to see the trigger mechanisms for a disease or disorder that are lurking within the genetic structure, to learn how we can treat it be - fore it damages vision.\" A \"golden age\" for basic vision research Pursuing such ambitious goals in the Vision Science Division is possible in part because basic research has entered a \"golden age\" for studies at the genetic level\u2014bringing with it a wealth of opportunities for prog - ress in ophthalmic studies. In the 1980s and '90s, researchers in labs worldwide produced significant advances in identify - ing the mechanisms of the eye, especially how it reacts to light, and the role of pho - toreceptors in the retina. \"Then at about the same time, we saw a wave of discovery about the functions of genes, which was great for vision science,\" says Dr. Travis. \"What came out of that period was the identification of about 200 different genes that can cause blindness or visual loss in humans.\" \"So after this period of discovery at the genetic level,\" says Dr. Travis, \"we were left with knowledge of many proteins and their genes, and we knew they were important, but we didn't really know their specific functions or how we can control them. Working to better understand those func - tions is what many of us are now doing. That's the way with basic research\u2014many challenges and even more opportunities for building our core understanding of the eye.\" A future of great promise As the third decade of the century begins, the opportunities for basic research in oph - thalmology are bright, the future filled with possibilities for advances. \"Over the last 20 years, we've made great progress in understanding the eye\u2014 at the level of cells, molecules, and genes,\" says Dr. Sampath, \"and in the Vision Science Division we've laid a foundation for moving increasingly toward answering essential questions involving therapies for a variety of blinding diseases, such as corneal blindness, age-related macular degeneration, or other inherited retinal degenerations. I think this is our direction over the next 10 years\u2014to be highly focused on translating our work from the lab to the bedside.\" *Pending title \"Working to model a disease from the earliest possible time in its development is precisely what we are focusing on in the lab. We want to see the trigger mechanisms for a disease or disorder that are lurking within the genetic structure, to learn how we can treat it before it damages vision.\" ROXANA A. RADU, MD Assistant Professor of OphthalmologyEYE | UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE | SPRING 20205Stargardt disease, an eye disease caused by the malfunction of a single gene, affects only a small percentage of people. But research on the disease in the Stein Eye Institute's Vision Science Division is also creating opportunities to learn about one of the most common causes of blindness. Hold a penny six inches in front of your nose. The area of vision blocked by the penny demonstrates the deterioration of sight in the mid-stages of Stargardt disease, a disorder that causes progressive degeneration of the macula, the oval region at the center of the retina. Discovered in 1909 by German ophthalmologist Karl Stargardt, the disease often begins in childhood, growing progressively worse for adolescents and adults; that penny- size area can eventually grow to the size of a cell phone held at the same distance, thus destroying sharp, straight- ahead vision and leaving behind only the fringes of sight. \"Imagine trying to read a book that is visible only in the corner of your eye\u2014you can't do it,\" says Gabriel H. Travis, MD, Charles Kenneth Feldman Chair in Ophthalmology. \"It's tremendously frustrating to be able to see but not fully identify anything.\" Stargardt disease is relatively rare, affecting about 1 in 10,000 Americans. But basic research in the Institute's Vision Science Division has not only led to significant advances in understanding the origins and progression of Stargardt disease, but is also moving to new directions in the study of even more common diseases of the macula that affect millions of new patients annually. Vitamin A: a key culprit in genetically triggered macular degeneration The cause of Stargardt disease is no mystery: it is an inher - ited disorder of the retina, caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene, and how the eye processes vitamin A. Any fourth-grader who has studied nutrition will tell you that vitamin A is important for healthy vision; vitamin A is a key component in the production of light-sensitive molecules inside the photoreceptors of the retina. Stargardt disease is the most common inherited disease of the retina caused by a single gene; a defect in the ABCA4 gene disrupts the creation of a protein that normally cleans the eye of toxic byproducts of vitamin A that are produced inside the photoreceptors. \"Without the proper function of the protein, a fatty sub - stance called lipofuscin clumps in the cells in the macula,\" says Alapakkam P. Sampath, PhD , associate director of the Stein Eye Institute and chief of the Vision Science Division. STARGARDT DISEASE AND BASIC RESEARCH: Insights that are Opening Doors \"The lipofuscin causes the photoreceptors to die; the result is the dark region in the center of the eye that grows as the disease progresses.\" Although Stargardt disease can be slowed through a diet low in Vitamin A and with protection from ultraviolet light, no full cure yet exists. However, study of Stargardt disease at the Institute has led to significant progress in understanding its progression\u2014work that may also lead to new directions in research on even more common diseases of the macula that affect millions of new patients annually. \"We know what causes Stargardt disease, but why the malfunction in the gene occurs and how we can prevent it are still ahead of us,\" says Dr. Travis, whose lab focuses on how light-receiving molecules are regenerated inside the rods and cones of the retina. But the Institute's work on Stargardt disease is also opening new opportunities to progress in understanding other eye diseases. In particular, researchers are focusing on age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which like Stargardt disease causes deterioration of the macula. AMD affects more than 100 million people worldwide, is the third most common cause of adult blindness (after cataracts and glaucoma), and is the most frequent con - tributor to vision loss in Americans over age 50. But AMD is not a genetic condition; the disease is caused primarily by lifestyle \u2014in particular smoking\u2014but also by poor diet and high blood pressure. So the issue addressed by Institute researchers is: what are the possible links between two diseases with vastly different causes but sim - ilar symptoms? Could AMD also be associated with a genetic mutation in addi - tion to its other risk factors? Research on Stargardt and other genetic diseases of the eye may help form an answer. \"What can we learn about AMD\u2014a disease with a variety of environ - mental causes that affects millions\u2014from our study of Stargardt, a disease with a sin - gle genetic origin?\" says Roxana A. Radu, MD , assistant professor of ophthalmology. 6 EYE | UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE | SPRING 2020The Stein Eye Institute's history with the National Eye Institute (NEI) can be traced to our founder, Dr. Jules Stein\u2014a musician, ophthalmologist, entertainment magnate, and advocate for vision\u2014whose multiyear campaign culminated in the establishment of the NEI in 1968. In his appearance before the United States Congress (shown in the above illustration), Dr. Stein said, \"I am here to express indignation that millions of our people are compelled to face the threat of visual loss without the benefit of sharp, pointed action.\" In Dr. Radu's Retina Biochemistry and Clinical Disease Modeling Laboratory, researchers are working to under - stand the mechanisms of how photoreceptor cells degen - erate, using experimental models of disease to investigate disruption of normal vision functioning at the levels of genes, molecules, and cells; and developing experimental treatments to prevent blindness. \"We are looking at the functions of the eye at their most fundamental,\" says Dr. Radu. \"Stargardt disease is important, because not only are we progressing in finding treatments for this specific disease, but we are also learning how this type of genetic-based disease may be a gateway to understanding much more common disorders.\" According to Dr. Travis, \"There's every reason to think that a treatment for Stargardt disease will soon be within our grasp. But even more important than a cure is what we will continue to learn about the core functions of the eye. That's what basic research is all about\u2014encountering the challenges and developing opportunities for building our core understanding of the functions of the eye.\" Says Dr. Radu, \"This type of basic research on the fundamental functions of the human cell is a meticulous process that can take years\u2014or decades. But the work is tremendously gratifying because it can tell us so much about eye diseases and the potential for cures. I'm so happy I can make a difference.\"\"There's every reason to think that a treatment for Stargardt disease will soon be within our grasp. But even more important than a cure is what we will continue to learn about the core functions of the eye.

TRAVIS, MD Charles Kenneth Feldman Chair in OphthalmologyEYE | UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE | SPRING 20207Research funding at UCLA from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is increasing, and the Stein Eye Institute is a significant beneficiary of this support, which is funded through the National Eye Institute (NEI). These seven new NIH grants awarded in 2019 total nearly $10 million in funding and indicate the scope of basic research within Stein Eye on key questions affecting the eye. Ava K. Bittner, OD, PhD Smotrich Family Optometric Clinician-Scientist Chair Development of a Behavioral Intervention with Socially Assistive Robots to Enhance Magnification Device Use for Reading This exploratory research project aims to customize and evaluate a socially assistive robot as a novel approach to motivate and encourage optimal use of new magnifi - cation devices for reading in individuals with vision loss. The goals are to promote patient acceptance, adherence, and skills reinforcement to achieve proficiency in the use of the magnifier in order to attempt to reduce visual disability while performing important daily activities, such as read - ing tasks. This is a high priority given the increasing prevalence of low vision, paucity of low vision rehabilitation providers, and barriers related to access to care, such as transportation and geography, all of which motivate the development of this com - plementary approach for the provision of additional support at home by the socially assistive robot. $439,994New Grants Fund Vital Research Jean-Pierre Hubschman, MD Associate Professor of Ophthalmology Intraocular Robotic Interventional and Surgical System for Automated Cataract Surgery This project aims to reduce the risk of surgi - cal complications and improve the surgical outcomes of cataract surgery by developing an automated, image-guided robotic sur - gical system for cataract extraction. The proposed surgical system (1) improves surgical safety through intraocular tissue stabilization and per-operative imaging during surgical tasks; (2) realizes com - plete visualization of the lens equator by incorporating an intraocular optical coher - ence tomography probe; and (3) improves refractive outcomes through accurate intra - ocular lens implant positioning. It is hypoth - esized that the proposed surgical system will decrease sight-threatening surgical complication rates, improve surgical out - comes, and abate costs related to surgical complications. $2,305,000 Amounts shown are the total for all years of NIH funding.8Anna Matynia, PhD Associate Research Ophthalmologist Molecular, Cellular, Anatomical, and Neurobiological Investigation of Melanopsin-Expressing Corneal Innervation, and Its Role in Pain and Photophobia Corneal pain is an important mechanism to detect injury or damage, leading to pro - tective responses to limit injury if possible (eg, tearing to remove a foreign object), initiate healing, and protect the ocular sur - face required for clear vision. When mal - adaptive, corneal pain can be so debilitat - ing as to limit daily function, dramatically reduce quality of life, and cause significant economic burden. The proposed research will elucidate the molecular, cellular, ana - tomical, and neurobiological mechanisms of ocular pain and hypersensitivity includ - ing photoallodynia by investigating corneal nerves and their responses in nonhuman disease models of corneal surface injury/ dry eye, allergic eye disease, and migraine. $1,950,000 Kouros Nouri-Mahdavi, MD, MSc Associate Professor of Ophthalmology Detection of Disease Progression in Advanced Glaucoma Eyes with advanced glaucomatous dam - age have little residual reserve and small amounts of progression can have important consequences affecting a patient's visual function and quality of life. The investi - gation's purpose is to optimize the use of longitudinal optical coherence tomography macular data to confirm and predict func - tional progression. Results of the study should lead to the development of more effective methods for earlier detection of glaucoma progression and will allow cli - nicians to more aggressively treat deteri - orating eyes resulting in decreased visual disability and reduced rates of blindness from glaucoma. $1,951,500Gabriel H. Travis, MD Charles Kenneth Feldman Chair in Ophthalmology Mechanisms for Light-Driven Chromophore Synthesis by M\u00fcller Cells to Regenerate Cone Opsin and Maintain Cone Sensitivity The research purpose is to provide import - ant new information about the functioning of cones under daylight conditions. Prelim - inary studies suggest that the regeneration of cone pigments is driven by light through a novel biochemical mechanism in M\u00fcller cells. Given the importance of cones to human vision, the proposed research is highly relevant to the National Eye Insti - tute's mission. The gene for one of the pro - teins to be studied (RGR) is a susceptibility locus for retinitis pigmentosa, hence the project is also relevant to the broad National Institutes of Health mission that pertains to reducing illness and disability. $2,271,848 Irena Tsui, MD Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology Retinal and Choroidal Vasculature Changes in Healthy and High-Risk Pregnancies Pregnancy is a complex process that can lead to physiologic changes as well as complications such as preterm birth and preeclampsia. This study aims to use pic - tures of the retina to generate normative pregnancy curves as well as to predict which pregnancies will develop perinatal complications. Success of this endeavor will allow better prediction and monitoring of high-risk pregnancies. $445,314David S. Williams, PhD Karl Kirchgessner Foundation Chair in Vision Science* Exploring the Relationship of Water Flow Across the RPE and Mutant-MYO7A/Usher 1B Patients with Usher syndrome type 1B fre - quently suffer from cystoid macular edema (CME), which causes fluid accumulation in the retina and impairs central vision in young patients. The proposed research will explore why mutant MYO7A, the genetic cause of Usher 1B, affects water flow across the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). It will also test the efficacy of the drugs commonly prescribed for CME in promoting water flow across Usher 1B RPE, thus potentially iden - tifying the most treatment for CME in Usher 1B. $429,000 *Pending titleEYE | UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE | SPRING 20209 Laboratory-based research, also called basic vision-science re- search, forms the foundation for the clinical research, educa- tion, and patient care that are the visible hallmarks of the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology.

CLINICAL FOCUS EYE | UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE | SPRING 2020 14A research team of neuro-ophthalmol - ogists in the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology is attracting con - siderable interest from pharmaceutical companies for the group's expertise in optic nerve diseases. Although the diseases stud - ied by Alfredo A. Sadun, MD, PhD , and his colleagues are rare, they are increasingly viewed as models for both ophthalmologic and non-ophthalmologic conditions that affect much larger populations, but are more complex and difficult to study. Dr. Sadun, Flora L. Thornton Endowed Chair in Vision Research at Doheny and vice chair of ophthalmology, Doheny Eye Center UCLA, is part of six formal clini - cal trials in neuro-ophthalmology, making the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology group by far the most active neuro-oph - thalmology research group in the country. Neuro-ophthalmology is a subspecialty focusing on how the brain works with the eye and processes visual information, as well as how the eye sends messages to the brain. From the beginning of his career, Dr. Sadun has been a leader in the latter, also known as the afferent pathway. In particular, Dr. Sadun and his col - leagues have concentrated on the optic nerve\u2014the cable connecting the eye and the brain, composed of 1.2 million fibers, each representing a different pixel point on the brain's vision map. \"It turns out that there are obvious and not-so- obvious diseases of the optic nerve,\" Dr. Sadun explains. \"The optic nerve can suffer any disease the brain can\u2014such as tumors, stroke, and multiple sclerosis\u2014but there are also diseases that affect the optic nerve specifically, which is what I find to be the most compelling.\" Intriguingly, these condi - tions almost all involve injury in one way or another to mitochondria\u2014the powerhouse of cells. \"In these diseases, if the mitochon - dria become sick, the canary in the coal mine is the optic nerve,\" Dr. Sadun says. Dr. Sadun is especially interested in Leb - er's hereditary optic neuropathy, a disease Exploring the Optic Nerve Stein/Doheny Research Group Leads the Way in Neuro-Ophthalmology Clinical Trials that affects only the genes of the mitochon - dria and can cause sudden and permanent blindness, usually among individuals in their teens or 20s. The genetics for Leber's are simple\u2014when the mother has a genetic defect in her mitochondria, it will always be passed down to her children; Leber's can - not be passed by the father. \"The genetic defect is necessary but not sufficient for blindness,\" Dr. Sadun notes. \"Something else triggers the disease and makes car - riers go blind, suddenly and dramatically.\" Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is extremely rare\u2014so rare, in fact, that Dr. Sadun sees many of the patients from throughout the United States who are sus - pected of having the disease. But the central involvement of mitochondria in the dis - ease also makes it of considerable interest as it becomes increasingly apparent that mitochondria are important in other, more common conditions. These include vision diseases such as macular degeneration and glaucoma, as well as neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. With three decades of experience determining the natural history of a pure mitochondrial disease, Dr. Sadun's group has emerged as a focal point for clinical trials of optic nerve conditions such as Leber's that could also prove effective in treating the more com - mon conditions. Of the six ongoing clinical trials headed by the UCLA Department of Ophthalmol - ogy team, four involve Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy; the other two are for patients who experience a type of stroke of the optic nerve, properly termed acute nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neurop - athy (NAION), in which a loss of blood flow to the nerve causes sudden vision loss in one eye. Three of the trials for Leber's use gene therapy\u2014injecting a virus that delivers a \"good\" version of the mutated gene into the inner layer of the eye, where the cells that give birth to the optic nerve reside. The fourth Leber's-related study is the latest in a series of trials Dr. Sadun has led using Medical visualization showing an overhead view of the human head. The optic nerve, which connects the eyes to the brain, is highlighted in blue.EYE | UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE | SPRING 202015small molecules\u2014in this case, in the form of a topical ophthalmic solution\u2014designed to allow the affected cells to compensate for the genetic error. As recently as 15 years ago, there were no neuro-ophthalmology clinical trials in the United States, Dr. Sadun notes, because of the perceived small size of the market for neuro-ophthalmologic drugs. That was before it became apparent that because the optic nerve is part of the brain, clinical trials involving diseases of the optic nerve could serve as testing grounds for more complex neurological diseases that affect far more people. Dr. Sadun made that point early in his career with a study he published in the mid- 1980s showing that the optic nerve is also damaged in Alzheimer's disease. \"The rea - son I chose that approach was that I figured one quick measurement of visual function such as color vision was substantially eas - ier than subjecting people to a few days of psychometric examinations,\" Dr. Sadun explains. \"We have much better ways of measuring signs and symptoms for the eye.\" Ever since, he has consistently made the case that the accessibility of the optic nerve\u2014through both vision testing and the ability to image the eye as a transparent organ\u2014renders it a powerful model for gaining insight into a host of neurological diseases. \"There is much less 'noise' in studies of the optic nerve than there would be for something like Alzheimer's disease, where there are so many variations that could potential influence the results,\" Dr. Sadun says. \"Any disease of the brain also affects the optic nerve, but whereas the brain is diffuse, complicated, and hard to measure, in the optic nerve these diseases are very precise. We know the starting point is 1.2 million fibers, we know their size and location, and any damage can be assessed accurately through a variety of tests. In addition, when we have a patient com - plaining of a black spot or blurred vision, that's much more specific than when an Alzheimer's patient complains of not being able to think right.\" Using the optic nerve as a model for neurological studies, results in less \"noise,\" which means it takes fewer patients to prove the efficacy of a treatment, Dr. Sadun notes. The hope is that once that proof of principle is established for patients with optic nerve conditions, the same therapy could be tested in patients with the more common neurological diseases, using the already established information about dos - ing and side effects. That potential to bene - fit large numbers of patients is what makes the neuro-ophthalmology research at the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology of such great interest to the pharmaceutical industry.\"The optic nerve can suffer any disease the brain can\u2014such as tumors, stroke, and multiple sclerosis\u2014but there are also diseases that affect the optic nerve specifically, which is what I find to be the most compelling.\" ALFREDO A. SADUN, MD, PHD Vice Chair of Ophthalmology, Doheny Eye Center UCLAEYE | UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE | SPRING 202016Community Outreach Increasing Accessibility to Vision Care In 2019, the UCLA Mobile Eye Clinic (UMEC) collaborated with influential organizations including the Los Angeles Dodgers where they attended eight events and served over 230 patients. Based on the success of these vision-screening events, UMEC will be returning to the Los Ange - les Dodgers events in spring and summer 2020 to continue performing eye health screenings for underserved and under - treated Angelenos. Continuing to find ways to increase accessibility to vision care, in November 2019, UMEC partnered with Care Harbor, a mega-clinic event that focuses on grass - roots healthcare solutions and has served over 26,000 patients in the last 10 years. At Care Harbor, UMEC's team addressed the needs of patients who had preexisting eye health conditions including diabetes and high blood pressure to provide them with further examinations and referrals to specialists as needed. At the three-day event, UMEC's diverse staff of multilin - gual ophthalmologists, ophthalmic tech - nicians, volunteers, and interns provided care for 262 patients with 105 referrals for follow-up care. Additionally, in recognition for their impact on the Los Angeles community, UMEC received a grant of $75,000 from The Nicholas Endowment to support their efforts to alleviate visual healthcare dis - parities. These funds will be used to fully maximize the potential of the two mobile eye clinics in the UMEC Fleet. The grant will allow UMEC to leverage the two buses so they can operate concurrently, one con - ducting the pre-school and student eye evaluation programs, while the other serves the homeless population. During the holiday season, UMEC staff and volunteers continued to foster the com - munity and provide vision care services to underserved Angelenos by returning to volunteer at the Westside Thanksgiving Dinner and Celebration, an event that pro - vides medical, dental, and vision services to community members. UCLA Department of Ophthalmology doctors, technicians and staff volunteered to provide free health screenings at the event. Since fall 2019, UMEC's Student Lead - ership Club (UMEC SLC) has earned over $13,000 to support UMEC, which has been used to buy and distribute over 500 pairs of free reading glasses. Additionally, UMEC SLC was allocated funding for BruinCars to facilitate transportation for volunteers and interns to participate in health fairs and clinics to assist the UMEC staff with screenings and exams. Displaying their determination to maximize their impact on the community, UMEC SLC is also spear - heading a compliance call research project to assess pediatric adherence to eyeglasses to improve the current eye-care model. UMEC SLC's co-president, Winnie Liu , was also awarded the esteemed True Bruin Distinguished Senior Award for her dedi - cation to UMEC and for exemplifying the True Bruin values of Integrity, Excellence, Accountability, Respect, and Service. At Care Harbor and other events, the UCLA Mobile Eye Clinic team of ophthalmologists, ophthalmic technicians, volunteers, and interns performs eye health screenings for underserved and undertreated Angelenos, providing further examinations and referrals to specialists as needed. 171.

It can cause a scratchy or sandy feeling in the eye, stinging or burning, secretion of mucus, redness, bouts of excessive tearing (due to reduced lipid and mucin layers of the tear film), and diffi - culty wearing contact lenses. Though it may be a natural function of aging for some, dry eye can also be associated with diabetes, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, the taking of certain medications, and dry climates. As such, a generic \"one size fits all\" approach is not the most beneficial way to treat dry eye. In recognition that everybody's dry eye is unique and usually multifactorial, the UCLA Stein Eye Institute's newest clinic focuses solely on treating the condition. \"The clinic implements a full diagnostic workup look - ing at all the different parts of the ocular surface that can contribute to dry eye. This then helps us to tailor a specialized treat - ment focused on each patient's individ - ual needs,\" says Vivian Shibayama, OD , in runs the clinic with Saba Al-Hashimi, MD , health sciences assistant clinical professor of ophthalmology. \"These same diagnostic tests can then be used to determine if the therapy is effective.\" The clinic, located in the Jules Stein Build - ing at the Stein Eye Institute vision-science campus in Westwood, also offers in-office procedures not typically available at eye centers, such as BlephEx , a deep cleaning of the lid margin; LipiFlow to remove blockages from the meibo - pulsed light (IPL) therapy tion on the lid margin; scleral lenses, saline-filled contact lenses that encase the cornea in fluid; amniotic membrane therapy , which promotes healing with drops or in a contact lens form; and autol - ogous serum tears , customized drops derived from the patient's own blood that are rich with nutrients and growth factors that can help with certain types of dry eye. The ophthalmologists and optometrists in the clinic also work with other UCLA medical divisions, such as rheumatology and immunology, if necessary, as well as neurology if systemic disease is suspected to be correlated with the eye condition.New Clinic Focused on Treating Dry Eye To make an appointment at the UCLA Stein Eye Institute Dry Eye clinic, call: (310) 206-6351.EYE | UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE | SPRING 202019Institute News American Academy of Ophthalmology Honorees Congratulations to UCLA Department of Ophthalmology faculty and alumni who were recognized for their leadership in our field at the October 12-15, 2019, American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) annual meeting in San Francisco, California.

The Alumni Association also became an officially recognized UCLA Support Group, with the primary objectives to promote the social and professional relations of its members and alumni as well as advance the interests of Stein Eye and the Depart - ment of Ophthalmology. Stein Eye is the common bond, and as such, membership is open to all graduates, residents, fellows, faculty, and volunteer clinical faculty. Annual membership dues are nominal and help underwrite the Resident Research Grant Awards, the Stein Eye Institute Excellence in Research Gradua- tion Awards for Residents and Fellows, and the annual receptions at the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology. With the vast footprint Stein Eye has made in ophthalmology the world over, the officers are invigorated with the goal to inspire more active engagement of our broad group of constituents across all regions and foster a supportive network among Stein Eye and community-based ophthalmologists.

In addition to seeing friends and colleagues, the event marked a five-year milestone: In 2014, the Doheny Eye Institute began its historic partnership with the UCLA Depart - ment of Ophthalmology. With that action, UCLA became the only university in the United States with two eye institutes: the Stein Eye Institute and the Doheny Eye Institute. In his speech to attendees, Bartly J. Mondino, MD , chair of the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology and affiliation chair for the Doheny Eye Institute, reflected on this brave leap of faith: \"Over five years ago in the boardroom of the Doheny Eye Insti - tute, I looked around the table at members of the USC faculty and at Ronald E. Smith, MD , former chair of the Department of Ophthalmology at USC. There was a sense of understandable apprehension based on consideration of this drastic career move for each and every one of them. I told the USC faculty they would be on the ground floor in establishing something great\u2014this unprecedented and perhaps unique affiliation in ophthalmology.\" Trust in that promised outcome was justified. Doheny's part - nership with UCLA has proven to be a bona fide success. Over 20 faculty have been recruited as a result of the affiliation, and between the two Institutes, there are 35 endowed chairs and more than 30 fellows. Doheny Eye Centers UCLA in Arcadia, Orange County, and Pasadena are operational, with strong upward trajectories in new visits, return visits, and surgeries. Just as importantly, the three Centers have returned a profit, which is noteworthy for medical centers with senior faculty, broad research, federal grants, and educational activities. Looking forward, the Doheny Eye Institute has purchased a state-of-the-art facility in Pasadena, with generous grounds for parking and future expansion. The building will include research labs, as well as educational and patient care facilities. The Doheny Eye Institute in \"Eastwood\" will be home to the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology's second vision-science campus, complementing the Stein Eye Institute's vision-science campus in Westwood, which was completed in 2017, with the construc - tion of the Edie & Lew Wasserman Building and renovation and seismic upgrade of the Jules Stein Building. \"Aside from the historic and remarkable affiliation,\" said Alfredo A. Sadun, MD, PhD , vice chair of ophthalmology at the Doheny Eye Center UCLA, \"I personally feel extremely gratified that the large core of former faculty, who, by voting with their feet demonstrated great courage in leaving USC, can now look back, five years after, knowing that their faith in UCLA, in our leadership, and in each other, was fully justified.\" The Doheny Eye Institute vision-science campus in Pasadena, anticipated opening 2021.
