Additionally, our Center frequently participates in clinical trials utilizing the latest wound care products available. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy is a proven medical treatment that enhances the body's natural healing while strengthening the immune system. Delivered and monitored by trained wound healing center specialists, HBOT is an effective treatment option for many chronic wounds. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a high-oxygen-pressure course of treatment used for various conditions and illnesses, including diabetic ulcers and other non-healing wounds, necrosis of soft tissue and bone due to radiation treatments, gas gangrene and more. Inside the comfortable chamber, pure oxygen is administered at an air pressure 2 to 3 times higher than that of the external atmosphere. By placing the patient in a high-pressure, high-oxygen environment, the body's white blood cells significantly increase the body's ability to heal. As the patient breathes normally, the high pressure atmosphere forces pure oxygen into the bloodstream, increasing blood flow and creating new blood vessels. This increased oxygen delivery to all tissues improves the ability of the white blood cells to kill bacteria and helps boost the body's own natural healing process. Throughout the treatment session, the HBOT technicians are in ongoing contact with each patient, ensuring the highest level of comfort and accommodation. The technicians can view the patient in the chamber, adjust the temperature and help ensure maximal patient comfort throughout the process. Patients can read, watch television or just relax. Physician supervision is provided during all treatments, to ensure the highest quality of care. HBOT is an effective treatment for: - Diabetic ulcers of leg and foot - Chronic Bone Infection - Gas gangrene - Necrosis of soft tissue and bone due to cancer radiation treatments - Non-healing sores and wounds - Post surgical procedures - Preservation of compromised skin grafts\\ - Other Non-Healing Wounds HBOT is recognized as a successful adjunctive treatment by the American Medical Association, Medicare, and most commercial insurers.
