Each Party shall ensure that the merits of the case are duly taken into account. Pending the outcome of any such appeal, the decision of the re gulator shall stand, un less the appeal body decides otherwise.

Each Party shall ensure that any se rvices suppliers authorised to provide electronic communication services have th e right and obligatio n to negotiate access and interconnection with suppliers of pub licly available electronic communication networks and services. Access and intercon nection should in principle be agreed on the basis of commercial negotiation betw een the services suppliers concerned. 2.

Each Party shall ensure that upon the finding in accordance with Article 105 of this Agreement that a relevant market is not effectively competitive, the regulatory authority shall have the pow er to impose on the supplier designated as having significant market power one or more of the following obligations in relation to interconnection and/or access: (a) obligation on non-discrimination to ensure that the operator applies equivalent conditions in equivalent circumstances to other suppliers providing equivalent services, and provides services and information to others under the sa me conditions and of the same quality as it 72 provides for its own services, or thos e of its subsidiaries or partners; (b) obligation of a vertically integr ated company to make transparent its wholesale prices and its internal transfer prices, where there is a re quirement for non-discrimination or for prevention of unfair cross-subsidy. The regulatory authority may specify the format and accounting methodology to be used; (c) obligations to meet reasonable requests for ac cess to, and use of, specific network elements and associated facilities, including unbundled acce ss to the local loop, inter alia, in situations where the regulatory authority considers that denial of access or unreasonable terms and conditions having a similar effect would hinder the emergence of a sustainable competitive market at the retail level, or would not be in the end user's interest. Regulatory authorities may at tach conditions covering fairness, reasonableness and timeliness to the obligations included under this point; (d) to provide specified services on a wholesale basi s for resale by third parties; to grant open access to technical interfaces, protocols or ot her key technologies that are indispensable for the interoperability of services or virtual netw ork services; to provide co-location or other forms of facility sharing, including duct, build ing or mast sharing; to provide specified services needed to ensu re interoperability of end-to-end services to us ers, including facilities for intelligent network services; to provide ac cess to operational support systems or similar software systems necessary to en sure fair competition in th e provision of services; to interconnect networks or network facilities. Regulatory authorities may a ttach conditions covering fairness, reasonableness and timeliness to the obligations included under this point; (e) obligations relating to cost recovery and pr ice controls, including obligations for cost orientation of prices and obligations concerning cost accounting systems, for the provision of specific types of interconnection and/or ac cess, in situations where a market analysis indicates that a lack of effective competition means that the operator concerned might sustain prices at an excessively high level, or apply a price squeeze, to the detriment of end- users. Regulatory authorities shall take into account the investment made by the operator and allow the operator a reasonable rate of return on ad equate capital employed, taking into account the risks involved; (f) to publish the specific obligations imposed on se rvices suppliers by the regulatory authority identifying the specific product/service and ge ographical markets. Up -to-date information, provided that it is not confiden tial and it does not comprise business secrets is made publicly available in a manner that guarantees all intere sted parties easy access to that information; (g) obligations for transparency requiring operators to make public specifie d information and, in particular, where an operator has obligations of non-discrimination, the regulator may require that operator to publish a reference offer, which shall be sufficiently unbundled to ensure that services suppliers are not required to pay for facilities which are not necessary for 73 the service requested, giving a description of the relevant offerings broken down into components according to market needs, and th e associated terms and conditions including prices. 4. Each Party shall ensure that a service supplier requ esting interconn ection with a supplier designated as havi ng significant market power shall have recourse, either at any time or after a reas onable period of time which has been made publicly known, to an independent domestic body , which may be a regulatory body as referred to in Article 104(2)(d) of this Ag reement, to resolve disputes regarding terms and conditions for in terconnection and/or access. Article 108 Scarce resources 1. Each Party shall ensure that any proced ures for the allocatio n and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, numbers and rights of way, shall be carried out in an objective, proportionate, timely, tran sparent and non-discriminatory manner. The current state of allocated frequency bands shall be made publicly available, but detailed identification of frequencies alloca ted for specific government uses is not required. 2. Each Party shall ensure the effectiv e management of radio frequencies for electronic communication services in their territory with a view to ensure effective and efficient use of the spectrum. Where demand for sp ecific frequencies exceeds their availability, appropriate and transparent procedures shall be followed for the assignment of these frequencies in order to optimise their us e and facilitate the development of competition. 3. Each Party shall en sure that the assignment of na tional numbering resources and the management of the nati onal numbering plans are en trusted to the regulatory authority. 4. Where public or local authorities retain ownershi p or control of suppliers operating public communications networks and/or services, ef fective structural separation needs to be ensured between th e function responsibl e for granting the rights of way from activities associated with ownership or control. Article 109 Universal service 1. Each Party has the right to define the kind of universal se rvice obligations it wishes to maintain. 2. Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided they are administered in a transparent, obje ctive and non-discriminatory way. The administration of such obliga tions shall also be neutral with respect to competition 74 and be not more burdensome than nece ssary for the kind of universal service defined by the Party. 3. Each Party shall ensure that all supplier s should be eligible to ensure universal service and no services supplier shall be a priori excluded. The designation shall be made through an efficient, transparen t, objective and non-discriminatory mechanism. Where necessary, each Party shall assess whether the provision of universal service represents an unfair bu rden on organisation(s) designated to provide universal service. Where justified on the basis of such calculation, and taking into account the market benefit, if any, which accrues to an organisation that offers the universal service, regulatory authorities shall determine whether a mechanism is required to co mpensate the services supplie r(s) concerned or to share the net cost of univers al service obligations. 4. Each Party shall ensure that, where dire ctories of all subscrib ers are available to users, whether printed or electronic, the or ganisations that provide those directories apply the principle of non-discrimination to the treatment of information that has been provided to them by other organisations. Article 110 Cross-border provision of electronic communication services Neither Party may require a service supp lier of the other Party to set up an establishment, to establish any form of presen ce, or to be resident, in its territory as a condition for the cross-bord er supply of a service. Article 111 Confidentiality of information Each Party shall ensure the confidenti ality of electronic communications and related traffic data by means of a public communication network and publicly available electronic communica tion services without restri cting trade in services. Article 112 Disputes between services suppliers 1. Each Party shall ensure that in the event of a disp ute arising between suppliers of electronic communication networks or services in connect ion with rights and obligations referred to in this Section, the regulatory authority concerned shall, at the request of either Party, issue a binding decision to resolve the dispute in the shortest possible timeframe and in any case within four months. 2. The decision of the regulatory authority shall be made available to the public, having regard to the requirements of bus iness confidentiality. The suppliers of electronic communication netw orks and services concerned shall be given a full statement of the reasons on which it is based. 75 3. When such a dispute c oncerns the cross-border provision of services, the regulatory authorities concer ned shall co-ordinate their efforts in order to bring about a resolution of the dispute. Article 113 Gradual approximation With a view to considering further liberalisation of trad e in services, the Parties recognise the importance of the gradual approximation of the existing and future legislation of Georgia to the list of the Union acquis included in the Annex XV-B to this Agreement.

CHAPTER 8 Public procurement Article 141 Objectives 1. The Parties recognise the contributi on of transparent, non-discriminatory, competitive and open tendering to sust ainable economic development and set as their objective the effectiv e, reciprocal and gradual opening of their respective procurement markets. 2. This Chapter envisages mutual acces s to public procurement markets on the basis of the principle of national treatment at national, regional and local level for public contracts and concessions in the traditional sector as well as in the utilities sector. It provides for a gradual appr oximation of the public procurement legislation in Georgia with the Union public procurement acquis based on the principles governing public procurement in the Union a nd the terms and definitions set out in Directive 2004/18/ EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordina tion of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts an d public service contracts (Directive 2004/18/EC) and Directive 2004/17/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors (Directive 2004/17/EC). Article 142 Scope 90 1. This Chapter applies to works, supplies and services public c ontracts, as well as works, supplies and services contracts in the utilities sect ors and, if and where such contracts are used, to works and services concessions. 2. This Chapter applies to any contract ing authority and any contracting entity which meets the definitions of the Union public procurement acquis (hereinafter referred to as 'the contracting entities'). It covers also bodies governed by public law and public undertakings in the field of utilities such as state-owned enterprises carrying out the relevant activ ities and private undertakin gs operating on the basis of special and exclusive rights in the field of utilities (25). 3. This Chapter applies to contracts abov e the value thresholds set out in Annex XVI-A to this Agreement. 4. The calculation of the estimated value of a public contract shall be based on the total amount payable, net of taxes on valu e added. When applying these thresholds, Georgia shall calculate and convert contract values into its national currency, using the conversion rate of its national bank. 5. Value thresholds shall be revised regularly every two years, beginning in the year of entry into force of this Agreement, based on th e average daily value of the euro, expressed in Special Dr awing Rights, over the 24 months terminating on the last day of August preceding the revision with effect fr om January 1. The value of the thresholds thus revise d shall, where necessary, be rounded down to nearest thousand euro. The revision of the thres holds shall be adopted by the decision of the Association Committee in Trade configurat ion, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement. Article 143 Institutional background 1. Each Party shall establish or maintain an appropriate institutional framework and mechanisms necessary for the proper functioning of the public procurement system and the implementation of th e principles in this Chapter. 2. Georgia shall designate in particular: (a) an executive body at central government level tasked with guaranteeing a coherent policy and its implementation in all areas related to public procurement. That body shall facilitate and coordinate the implementation of this Chapter and guide the process of gradual approximation to the Union acquis, as set out in Annex XVI-B to this Agreement; (b) an impartial and independent body tasked with the review of decisions taken by contracting authorities or entities during the award of c ontracts. In this context, 'independent' means that that body shall be a public authority which is separate from all contracting entities and economic operators. There shall be a possibility to subject the decisions taken by this body to judicial review. 91 3. Each Party shall ensure that decisions taken by the authoritie s responsible for the review of complaints by economic operat ors concerning infringements of domestic law shall be effectively enforced. Article 144 1. No later than three years from the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall comply with a set of basic standa rds for the award of all contracts as stipulated in paragraphs 2 to 15 of th is Article. These basic standards derive directly from the rules and principles of public procurement, as regulated in the Union public procurement acq uis, including the principl es of non-discrimination, equal treatment, transparency and proportionality. 2. Each Party shall ensure that all intended procurem ents are published in an appropriate media (26) in a manner that is sufficient: (a) to enable the market to be opened up to competition; and (b) to allow any interested economic operator to have appropriate access to information regarding the intended procurement prior to the award of the contract and to express its interest in obtain ing the contract. 3. The publication shall be appropriate to the economic interest of the contract to economic operators. 4. The publication shall contain at least th e essential details of the contract to be awarded, the criteria for qualitative selection, the award method, the contract award criteria and any other additional inform ation that the economic operators reasonably need to decide whether to express their interest in obtaining the contract. 5. All contracts shall be awarded th rough transparent and impartial award procedures that prevent corruptive practices. This impartiality shall be ensured in particular through the non-discriminatory description of the subject matter of the contract, equal access for al l economic operators, a ppropriate time- limits and a transparent and ob jective approach. 6. When describing the characteristics of the required work, supply or service, the contracting entities shall use general descri ptions of performance and functions and international, European or national standards. 7. The description of the ch aracteristics required of a wo rk, supply or service shall not refer to a specific make or source, or a particular process, or to trademarks, patents, types or a specific origin or pro duction unless such a reference is justified by the subject matter of the contra ct and accompanied by the words 'or equivalent'. Preference shal l be given to the use of general descriptions of performance or functions. 92 8. Contracting entities shall not impose cond itions resulting in direct or indirect discrimination against the economic operators of the other Party, such as the requirement that economic operators interest ed in the contract must be established in the same country, region or territory as the contracting entity. Notwithstanding the above, in cases where it is justified by the specific circumstances of the contract, the successful ap plicant may be required to establish certain business infrastructure at the place of performance. 9. The time-limits for expression of interest and for submission of offers shall be sufficiently long to allow economic operators from the other Party to make a meaningful assessment of the tender and prepare their offer. 10. All participants must be able to know the ap plicable rules, selection criteria and award criteria in advance. Those rules mu st apply equally to all participants. 11. Contracting entities may invite a lim ited number of applicants to submit an offer, provided that: (a) this is done in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner; and (b) the selection is based only on objective factors such as the experience of the applicants in the sector concerned, the size and infrastructure of their businesses or their technical and professional abilities. In inviting a limited number of applicants to submit an offer, account shall be taken of the need to ensure adequate competition. 12. Contracting entities may use negotiated procedures only in exceptional and defined cases when the use of such a procedure effectively does not distort competition. 13. Contracting entities may use qualification systems only under the condition that the list of qualified operators is compiled by means of a sufficiently advertised, transparent and open procedure. Contracts falling within the scope of such a system shall be awarded also on a non-discriminatory basis. 14. Each Party shall ensure that contracts are awarded in a transparent manner to the applicant who has submitted the economi cally most advantageous offer or the offer with the lowest price, based on the tender criteria and the procedural rules established and communicated in advance. The final decisions shall be communicated to all applicants withou t undue delay. Upon request of an unsuccessful applicant, reasons must be provided in sufficient detail to allow the review of such a decision. 15. Each Party shall ensure that any person having or having had an interest in obtaining a particular contr act and who has been, or ri sks, being harmed by an alleged infringement is entitled to effec tive, impartial judici al protection against any decision of the contracting entity rela ted to the award of that contract. The decisions taken in the course and at the end of such review procedure shall be 93 made public in a manner that is suffici ent to inform all interested economic operators. Article 145 Planning of gradual approximation 1. Prior to the commencement of gradual approximation, Georgia shall submit to the Association Committee in Trade configurat ion, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement, a comprehensive roadmap for the implementation of this Chapter with time schedules and milestones which shall include all reforms in terms of approximation to the Unio n acquis and institutional capacity building. This roadmap shall comply with the phases and time schedules set out in Annex XVI-B to this Agreement. 2. Following a favourable opinion by the Associ ation Committee in Trade configuration, the roadmap shall be cons idered as the refere nce document for the implementation of this Chapter. The Union shall make its best efforts in assisting Georgia in the implementation of the roadmap. Article 146 Gradual approximation 1. Georgia shall ensure that its legislati on on public procurement will be gradually approximated to the Union's public procurement acquis. 2. Approximation to the Union acquis shall be carried out in consecutive phases as set out in the schedule in Annex XVI-B to this Agreement and further specified in identify elements that need not be approximated, whereas Annexes XVI-L to XVI-O to this Agreement identify elements of the Union acquis that remain outside the sc ope of approximation. In this process, due account shall be taken of the corresponding case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and th e implementing measures adopted by the European Commission as well as, shou ld it become necessary, of any modifications of the Union acquis occurr ing in the meantime. The implementation of each phase shall be evaluated by the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408( 4) of this Agreement, and, following a positive assessment by th at Committee, be linked to the reciprocal granting of market access as set out in Annex XVI-B to this Agreement. The European Commission shall notify Georgi a without undue delay of any modifications of the Union acquis. It shall, upon request, pr ovide appropriate advice and technical assistance for the purpose of im plementing such modifications. 3. The Association Committee in Trade c onfiguration shall only proceed to the evaluation of a next phase once the measures to implemen t the previous phase have 94 been carried out and approved in accordance with the moda lities set out in paragraph 2. 4. Each Party shall ensure that those aspects and ar eas of public procurement which are not covered by this Article comply with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and equal treatment as set out under Article 144 of this Agreement. Article 147 Market access 1. The Parties agree that th e effective and reciprocal op ening of their respective markets shall be attained gradually and simultaneously. During the process of approximation, the extent of the market access mutually gr anted shall be linked to the progress made in this process as stip ulated in Annex XVI-B to this Agreement. 2. The decision to proceed to a further phase of market opening shall be made on the basis of an assessment of the complia nce of the legislation adopted with the Union acquis as well as its practical im plementation. Such assessment shall be carried out regularly by the Association Co mmittee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 408(4) of this Agreement. 3. In so far as a Party has, in accord ance with Annex XVI-B to this Agreement, opened its procurement market to the other Party: (a) the Union shall grant access to contract award procedures to Georgian companies, whether established or not in the Union, pursuant to the Union public procurement rules under treatment no less favourable than that accorded to Union companies; (b) Georgia shall grant access to contract award procedures for Union companies, whether established or not in Georgia, pursuant to national procurement rules under treatment no less favourable than that accorded to Georgian companies. 4. After the implementation of the last pha se in the process of approximation, the Parties will examine the possi bility to mutually grant ma rket access with regard to procurement below the value thresholds set out in Annex XVI-A to this Agreement. 5. Finland reserves its position w ith regard to the \u00c5land Islands. Article 148 Information 1. Each Party shall ensure that contracting entities and economic operators are appropriately informed ab out public procurement pr ocedures, including through the publication of all relevant legi slation and administ rative rulings. 95 2.

Sub-section 3 Geographical indications Article 169 Scope 1. This Sub-Section applies to the recognition and protection of geographical indications which are originating in the territories of the Parties. 2. In order for a geographical indication of a Party to be protected by the other Party, it shall cover products within th e scope of the legislation of that Party referred to in Article 170 of this Agreement. Article 170 Established geograp hical indications 1. Having examined the Law of Geor gia on appellations of origin and Geographical Indications of Goods, a dopted on 22 August 1999, the Union concludes that that law m eets the elements laid down in Annex XVII-A to this Agreement. 2. Having examined Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/ 91 of 10 June 1991 laying down general rules on the definition, desc ription and presentation of aromatised wines, aromatized wine-bas ed drinks and aromatized wine-product cocktails, Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs, with its implementing rules, fo r the registration, control and protection of geographical indications of agricultural products and foodstuffs in the European Union, Section I of Chapter I of Title II of Part II of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for cer tain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) and Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 20 08 on the definition, de scription, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographic al indications of sp irit drinks, Georgia concludes that those laws, rules and proce dures meet the elements laid down in Annex XVII-A to this Agreement. 3. Georgia, after having completed an ob jection procedure in accordance with the criteria set in Annex XVII-B to this Agreement, having examined a summary of the specifications of the ag ricultural products and foodstuffs corresponding to the geographical indications of the Union listed in Anne x XVII-C to th is Agreement and the geographical indications for wines, aromatised wines and spirit drinks 104 listed in Annex XVII-D to this Agreement, which have been registered by the Union under the legislation referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, shall protect those geographical indications according to the level of pr otection laid down in this Sub-section. 4. The Union, after having completed an objection pr ocedure in accordance with the criteria set out in A nnex XVII-B to this Agreem ent, having examined a summary of the specificati ons of the agricultural products and foodstuffs corresponding to the geograph ical indications of Georgi a listed in Annex XVII-C to this Agreement and the geographical indications for wines, aromatised wines and spirit drinks listed in Annex XVII-D to this Agreem ent, which are registered by Georgia under the legislation referred to in paragraph 1, shall protect those geographical indications according to the le vel of protection laid down in this Sub- Section. 5. The decisions of the Joint Committee set up by Article 11 of the Agreement between the European Union and Georgi a on protection of geographical indications of agricultural products and foodstuffs concerni ng the amendment of Annexes III and IV to that Agreement, wh ich are taken before the entry into force of this Agreement, shall be deemed to be decisions of the Geog raphical Indications Sub-Committee, and the geographical indi cations added to Annexes III and IV to that Agreement shall be deemed to be pa rt of Annexes XVII-C and XVII-D of this Agreement. Accordingly, the Parties shall protect those geographical indications as established geographical indica tions under this Agreement. Article 171 Addition of new geographical indications 1. The Parties agree on the possibility to add new geographical indications to be protected in Annexes XVII-C and XVII-D to this Agreement in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 179(3) of this Agreement after having completed the objection procedure and after having ex amined a summary of the specifications as referred to in Article 170(3) and (4) of this Agreement to the satisfaction of both Parties. 2. A Party shall not be required to protec t as a geographical in dication a name that conflicts with the name of a plant variety or an animal breed and as a result is likely to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the product. Article 172 Scope of protection of geographical indications 1. The geographical indications listed in Annexes XVII-C and XVII-D to this Agreement, as well as those added pursuant to Article 171 of this Agreement, shall be protected against: 105 (a) any direct or indirect commercial use of a protected name: (i) for comparable products not compliant with the product specification of the protected name, or (ii) in so far as such use exploits the reputation of a geographical indication; (b) any misuse, imitation or evocation (28), even if the true origin of the product is indicated or if the protected name is translated or accompan ied by an expression such as similar; (c) any other false or misleading indication as to the provenance, origin, nature or essential qualities of the product, on the inner or outer packaging, advertising material or documents relating to the product concerned, and the packing of the product in a container liable to convey a false impression as to its origin; (d) any other practice liable to mislead the consum er as to the true origin of the product. 2. If geographical indications are wholly or partially homonymous, protection shall be granted to each indicatio n provided that it has been used in good faith and with due regard for local and traditional usage a nd the actual risk of confusion. Without prejudice to Article 23 of the TRIPS Agr eement, the Parties shall mutually decide the practical conditions of use under which the homonymous geographical indications will be differentiated from each other, taking into account the need to ensure equitable treatment of the produ cers concerned and that consumers are not misled. A homonymous name which mislead s the consumer into believing that products come from another territory shall not be registered even if the name is accurate as far as the actual territory, region or place of origin of the product in question is concerned. 3. Where a Party, in the context of negotia tions with a third country, proposes to protect a geographical indication of th at third country, and the name is homonymous with a geographical indication of the other Party, the latter shall be informed and be given the opportunity to comment before the name becomes protected. 4.

Similarly, geographical in dications protected under th is Sub-Section in a Latin alphabet shall be protected to gether with their tr anscription in the characters of the Georgian alphabet and in the characters of other non-Latin alphabets officially used in the Member States. This transc ription may also be used for labelling purposes for the products concerned. Article 174 Right of use of geographical indications 1. A name protected under this Sub- Section may be used by any operator marketing agricultural products, foodstu ffs, wines, aromatised wines or spirit drinks conforming to the corresponding specification. 2. Once a geographical indication is protec ted under this Sub-Section, the use of such protected name shall not be subject to any registration of users or further charges. Article 175 Enforcement of protection The Parties shall enforce the protection provi ded for in Articles 170 to 174 of this Agreement by appropriate administrative action by their public authorities. They shall also enforce such protection at the request of an interested party. Article 176 Relationship with trademarks 1. The Parties shall refuse to register or sh all invalidate, ex offi cio or at the request of any interested party in c onformity with the legislation of each Party, a trademark that corresponds to any of the situations referred to in Article 172(1) of this Agreement in relation to a protected geographical i ndication for like products, provided an application to register the trademark is submitted after the date of application for protection of the geographic al indication in the territory concerned. 2. For geographical indications referred to in Article 170 of this Agreement, the date of application for protection shall be 1 April 2012. 3. For geographical indications referred to in Article 171 of this Agreement, the date of application for protec tion shall be the date of the transmission of a request to the other Party to protect a geographical indication. 4. The Parties shall have no obligation to protect a geographical indication where, in the light of a reputed or well-known tr ademark, protection is liable to mislead consumers as to the true identity of the product. 107 5. Without prejudice to paragraph 4, the Parties shall pr otect geographical indications also where a prior trademark exists. A prior trad emark shall mean a trademark the use of which corresponds to one of the situations referred to in Article 172(1) of this Agreement, whic h has been applied for, registered or established by use, if that possibility is provided for by the legislation concerned, in the territory of one of the Parties be fore the date on which the application for protection of the geographical indication is submitted by the other Party under this Sub-Section. Such trademark may co ntinue to be used and renewed notwithstanding the protection of the geographical indication, provided that no grounds for the trademark's invalidity or revocation exist in the legislation on trademarks of the Parties. Article 177 General rules 1. This Sub-Section shall apply without pr ejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties under th e WTO Agreement. 2. The import, export and marketing of a ny product referred to in Articles 170 and 171 of this Agreement shall be conduc ted in compliance with the laws and regulations applying in the terr itory of the importing Party. 3.

In particular a desi gn right shall not subsist in features of appearance of a prod uct which are required to be re produced in their exact form and dimensions in order to permit the pro duct in which the design is incorporated or to which it is applied to be mechanically connected to or placed in, around or against another product so that either product may perform its function. Article 183 Relationship to copyright A design shall also be eligible for protec tion under the law of copyright of a Party as from the date on which the design was created or fixed in any form.

The Parties may provide that, in appr opriate cases and at the request of the person liable to be subject to the measures provided for in this Article, the competent judicial authorities may order pe cuniary compensation to be paid to the injured party instead of applying the measur es provided for in th is Article if that person acted unintentionally and without ne gligence, if execution of the measures in question would cause hi m/her disproportionate harm and if pecuniary compensation to the injured party appears reasonably satisfactory. Article 196 Damages 116 1.

The process consists of an objective demonstration of equivalence of individual measures by the exporting Party and an objective assessment of the equivalence with a view to the possible recogn ition of equivalence by the importing Party; (d) the final recognition of equivalence of the re levant measures of the exporting Party rests solely with the importing Party. 2. Preconditions: (a) the process depends on the health or pest status, the law and the effectiveness of the inspection and control system related to the commo dity in the exporting Party. To this end the law in the sector concerned shall be taken into account, as well as the structure of the competent authority of the exporting Party, the command chain, the authority, the operational procedures and resources, and the effectiveness of the competent authorities as regards inspection and control systems, includin g the level of enforcement related to the commodity and the regularity and the rapidity of information flow to the importing Party in case of identified hazards. Th is recognition may be supported by documentation, verification and document, reports and information relate d to past experiences, assessments and verifications earlier documented; (b) the Parties shall initiate the pr ocess of recognition of equivalence pursuant to Article 57 of this Agreement after the successful completion of the approximation of a measure, a group of measures or a system included in the approx imation list set out in Article 55(4) of this Agreement; (c) the exporting Party shall initiate the process only when no safeguard measures imposed by the importing Party apply to the expo rting Party as rega rds the commodity. 3. The process: (a) the exporting Party initiates th e process by submitting to the importing Party a request for recognition of equivalence of an individual me asure or a group of measures or a system for a commodity or a category of commodities in a sector or sub-sector or all of them; (b) when appropriate, this request includes also the request and the required documentation for approval by the importing Party on the basis of equivalence of any programme or plan of the exporting Party required by the importing Party and/or the status of approximation as laid down in Annex XI of this Agreement regarding the measures or systems described in point (a) of this paragraph as a condition for allowing import of that commodity or a categories of 253 commodities; (c) with this request, the exporting Party: (i) explains the importance for trade of that commodity or categories of commodities; (ii) identifies the individual measure(s) with which it can comply from all the measures expressed in the import conditions of the importing Party ap plicable to that commodity or category of commodities; (iii) identifies the individual measure(s) for which it seeks equivalence out of the total of the measures expressed in the import conditions of the importing Party, applicable to that commodity or categories of commodities; (d) in reply to this request the importing Party ex plains the overall and individual objective and the rationale behind its measure(s), including the identification of the risk; (e) with this explanation, the importing Party in forms the exporting Part y on the relationship of its domestic measures and the import condit ions for that commodity or categories of commodities; (f) the exporting Party objectively demonstrates to the importing Party that the measures that it has identified are equivalent to the import co nditions for that commodity or category of commodities; (g) the importing Party objectively assesses the demonstration of equivalence by the exporting Party; (h) the importing Party concludes whether equivalence is achieved or not; (i) the importing Party provides to the exporting Party full explanation and supporting data for its determination and decision if so required by the exporting Party. 4.

When appropriate, equivalence shall objectively be demonstrated for any plan or program required by the importing Party as a condition to allo w import (e.g. residue plan, etc.); (b) objective demonstration and assessment in this context should be based, as far as possible, on: (i) internationally recognis ed standards; and/or (ii) standards based on proper scientific evidence; and/or 254 (iii) risk assessment; and/or (iv) documents, reports and inform ation related to past experiences, assessments and/or (v) verifications; and (vi) legal status or level of administrative status of the measures; and (vii) level of implementation and enforcement on the basis of, in particular: \u2014 corresponding and relevant results of surveillance and monitoring programmes; \u2014 inspection results of the exporting Party; \u2014 results of analysis with recognised analysis methods; \u2014 verification and import check re sults by the importing Party; \u2014 the performance of the competent aut horities of the exporting Party; and \u2014 earlier experiences. 5. Conclusion of the importing Party The process may include an inspection or verification; In case the importing Party arrives at a ne gative conclusion, it shall provide the exporting Party with a detaile d and reasoned explanation. 6. For plants and plant products, equivalence concerning phytosanitary measures, shall be based on the conditions referred to in Article 57(6) of this Agreement. ANNEX IX IMPORT CHECKS AND INSPECTION FEES A. Principles of import checks Import checks consist of documentary chec ks, identity checks an d physical checks. As regards animals and animal products, the physical checks and their frequency shall be based on the level of the risk associated with such imports. In carrying out the checks for plant hea lth purposes, the importing Party shall ensure that the plants, plant products and other objects shall be meticulously inspected on an official ba sis, either in their enti rety or by inspecting a representative sample, in order to make sure, that they are not contaminated by pests. 255 In the event that the check s reveal non-conformity with the relevant standards and/or requirements, the importing Party sh all take measures pr oportionate to the risk involved. Wherever possible, the impo rter or his representative shall be given access to the consignment and the opportunity to provide any relevant information to assist the importing Party in taking a fi nal decision concerning the consignment. Such decision shall be proportional to the level of the risk a ssociated with such imports. B. Frequencies of physical checks B.1.

ANNEX X CERTIFICATION A. Principles of certification Plants and plant products and other objects: In respect of certification of plants and plant products and other objects, the competent authorities shall apply the principles laid down in the relevant ISPMs. Animals and animal products: 1. The competent authorities of the Parties shal l ensure that certifying officers have a satisfactory knowledge of the veterinary law as regards the animals or animal products to be certified and, in general, are informed about the rules to be followed for drawing up and issuing of the certificates and, if necessary, as to the nature and extent of the enquiries, tests or examinations which should be carried out before certification. 2. Certifying officers must not certify data of which they have no personal knowledge or which cannot be ascertained by them. 3. Certifying officers must not sign blank or incomplete certificates, or certificates relating to animals or animal products, which they have not inspected or which have passed out of their control. Where a certificate is signed on the basis of another certificate or attestation, the certifying officer shall be in possession of the latter document before signing. 4. A certifying officer may certify data which have been: (a) ascertained on the basis of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Annex by another person authorised by the competent authority and acting under the control of the latter authority, provided that the certifying officer can verify the accuracy of the data; or (b) obtained, within the context of monitoring programmes, by reference to officially recognised quality assurance schemes or by means of an epidem iological surveillance system where this is authorised under the relevant veterinary law. 5. The competent authorities of the Parties shall ta ke all necessary steps to ensure the integrity of certification. In particular they shall ensure that certifying officers designated by them: (a) have a status which ensures their impartialit y and have no direct commercial interest in the animals or products being certified or in the holdings or establishments in which they originate; and (b) are fully aware of the significance of the c ontents of each certificate which they sign. 259 6. Certificates shall be drawn up in order to ensure that a specific certificate refers to a specific consignment in a language understood by the ce rtifying officer and in at least one of the official languages of the importing Party as set out in Part C of this Annex. 7. Each competent authority shall be in a position to link a certificate with the relevant certifying officer and ensure that a copy of all certificates issued is available for a period to be determined by that competent authority. 8. Each Party shall introd uce the checks and the controls necessary to prevent the issuing of false or misleading certifications and the fraudule nt use of certificates purported to be issued for the purposes set out in the veterinary law. 9. Without prejudice to any judicial proceedings or penalties, the competent authorities shall carry out investigations or checks and take ap propriate measures to penalise any instances of false or misleading certification, which are br ought to their attention. Such measures may include the temporary suspension of the certif ying officers from their duties until the investigation is over. In particular: (a) if in the course of the checks it is found that a certifying officer has knowingly issued a fraudulent certificate, the competent authority shall take all necessary steps to ensure, as far as is possible, that the person concerned cannot repeat the offence; (b) if in the course of the checks it is found th at an individual or an undertaking has made fraudulent use of or has altered an official certificate, the competent authority shall take all necessary measures to ensure, as far as possible, that the individual or the undertaking cannot repeat the offence. Such measures may include a refusal to issue an official certificate to the person or the undertaking concerned. B. Certificate referred to in Ar ticle 60(2)(a) of this Agreement The health attestation in the certificate re flects the status of equivalence of the commodity concerned. The health attestation stat es compliance with the production standards of the exporting Party recognised as equivalent by the importing Party. C. Official languages for certification 1. Import into the European Union For plants, plant products and other objects: The certificates shall be drawn up in a language understood by the certifying officer and in at least one of the offi cial languages of the importing Party. For animals and animal products: The health certificate must be drawn up in at least one of the official languages of the EU Member State of dest ination and in one of those of the EU Member State in which the import checks provided for in Ar ticle 63 of this Agreement are carried 260 out. However, an EU Member State may co nsent to the use of an official Union language other than its own. 2. Import into Georgia The health certificate must be drawn up in Georgian, and in at least one of the official languages of the cer tifying EU Member State. ANNEX XI APPROXIMATION ANNEX XI-A PRINCIPLES FOR THE EVALUATION OF PROGRESS IN THE APPROXIMATION PROCESS FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECOGNITION OF EQUIVALENCE PART I Gradual approximation 1. General rules The sanitary, phytosanitary and animal welfare law of Georgia shall be gradually approximated to that of the Union, based on the approximation list of the EU sanitary, phytosanitary and an imal welfare law. That li st shall be divided into priority areas that relate to measures, as defined in Annex IV to this Agreement. For this reason Georgia shall id entify its trade priority areas. Georgia shall approximate domestic ru les to the EU acquis by either: (a) implementing and enforcing through the adoption of additional domestic rules or procedures the rules in relevant EU acquis, or (b) by amending relevant domestic rules or procedures to incorporate the rules in relevant EU acquis. In either case, Georgia shall: (a) eliminate any laws, regulations or any other me asures inconsistent with the approximated domestic legislation; (b) ensure the effective implementation of approximated domestic legislation. Georgia shall document such approximation in tables of correspondence according to a model indicating the date on which domestic rules enter into force and the official journal in which the rules were published. The model of the tables of 261 correspondence for the prepara tion and evaluation is provid ed in Part II of this Annex. If the approximation is not complete, reviewers (1) shall describe the shortcomings in the column provided for comments. Irrespective of the priority area identified, Georgia shall prepare specific tables of correspondence demonstrating the approximation for other general and specific legislation, including, in partic ular, the general rules related to: (a) control systems: \u2014 domestic market, \u2014 imports; (b) animal health and welfare: \u2014 the identification and the registration of animals and the registration of their movements, \u2014 the control measures for animal diseases, \u2014 domestic trade with live animals, semen, ova and embryos, \u2014 animal welfare on farms, during transport and slaughter; (c) food safety: \u2014 placing on the market of food and feed, \u2014 labelling, presentation and advertising of food including nutritional and health claims, \u2014 residues controls, \u2014 specific rules for feed; (d) animal by-products; (e) plant health: \u2014 harmful organisms, \u2014 plant protection products; (f) genetically modified organisms: \u2014 released into the environment, \u2014 genetically modified food and feed.

Tables of correspondence shall be prepared according to the model as laid down in point (2) of this Annex for each single ap proximated act and s ubmitted in English for review by the reviewers. If the result of the evaluation is positive for an individual measure, a group of measures, a system applicable to a sector , sub-sector, a commodity or a group of commodities, the conditions of Article 57(4) of this Agreement shall apply. 2. Tables of correspondence 2.1. When preparing tables of corresp ondence, the following shall be taken into consideration: The EU acts shall serve as a basis for prep aration of a table of correspondence. To this end the version in force at the time of approximation shall be used. Particular attention shall be paid to precise translatio n into the national la nguage, as linguistic imprecisions may lead to misinterpretation, in particular if they concern the scope of the law (3). 2.2. Model of table of correspondence: Table of correspondence BETWEEN Title of the EU act, latest amendments incorporated: AND Title of the national act (Published in) Date of publication: Date of implementation: EU Act National legislation Remarks (from Georgia) Reviewer's comments Legend: EU act: its articles, paragraphs, sub-paragraphs etc. shall be mentioned with full title and 263 reference (4) in the left column of the table of correspondence.
