Yet, moisture trapped inside respiratory tubing can cause ventilator acquired pneumonia (VAP), which puts the health of patients in jeopardy. Envalior's Arnitel\u00ae VT materials offer unique moisture vapor transmission capabilities to minimize rainout that forms inside tubing, and support design simplification that can potentially eliminate the need for moisture traps. Governments and medical industry leaders are taking action to aid patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - the [third leading cause of death worldwide](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-(copd)). Although widespread vaccination against COVID-19 has lowered the number of ICU patients who need to be put on respiratory support, the rising rate of COPD continues to drive up the need for mechanical ventilators each year. Between 2022 and 2030, the market for these devices is estimated to see a [compound annual growth rate of 4.8%](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/mechanical-ventilators-market). Approximately 2 million hospital patients placed on mechanical ventilators each year are expected to develop ventilator acquired pneumonia (VAP), which has a mortality rate of up to 13% in the US. Respiratory tubing is prone to building up condensate and creating a risk of microaspiration. Bacteria-filled microdroplets can be re-aspirated back into the lungs and increase the patient's likelihood of developing VAP - a risk that increases the longer someone needs to be intubated and undergo continuous mechanical ventilation. To address this issue, ventilators are often designed with moisture condensation traps that help prevent fluid from building up. However, in addition to creating more work for nurses and clinicians, opening a breathing circuit to drain this trap also increases the risk of bacteria-laden fluid that collects above the endotracheal tube (ET) leaking past the cuff and entering the lungs. Polyolefin materials, which are most commonly used to manufacture respiratory tubing, don't allow condensate to escape. Ventilator tubing developers stand to gain a competitive advantage by leveraging a copolyester elastomer material capable of transporting moisture out through the tube wall to the ambient environment. This approach to mitigating rainout can significantly minimize condensation and may eliminate the need for a moisture trap altogether - lowering the risk of VAP, simplifying breathing circuit designs and driving cost savings. Envalior's Arnitel\u00ae VT material solutions respond to ongoing challenges and changing requirements that medical device suppliers face. With the performance characteristics of high-strength rubber combined with outstanding flexibility, the thermoplastic elastomer compound is optimized for medical tubing applications designed for high-stress clinical settings and offers: Arnitel VT's monolithic membrane is a unique combination of soft and hard polymer blocks that continuously absorbs moisture into the inner tube wall and expels it through the surface. ASTM E96 cup testing conducted by our team verifies that our Arnitel VT3112 offers a MVTR of 17,500 (g/m\u00b2/day) - outperforming every widely-used respiratory tubing material. Our Arnitel portfolio includes a range of grades that demonstrate varying strength, stiffness and MVTR performance to meet individual customer requirements. As you develop next-generation breathing circuits, we are prepared to help you save more time and costs. Our teams provide advanced part modeling capabilities to accurately predict the long-term performance of tubing in high humidity conditions - eliminating unnecessary design cycles while keeping patients safe. To help you meet the rising demand for medical equipment with a lower carbon footprint, we offer numerous bio-based materials for medical applications - and are launching a complete portfolio of these solutions by 2030. Delivering lifesaving medical equipment such as ventilators means centering your activities around patient safety. Envalior's approach to customer success combines in-depth material and design expertise and has enabled medical equipment suppliers worldwide to launch next-generation devices that are sustainable, cost-effective and significantly improve patient outcomes.
