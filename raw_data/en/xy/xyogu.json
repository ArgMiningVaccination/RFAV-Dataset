Multi-disciplinary Corrective Care Colorado Health and Wellness offers multi-disciplinary holistic care that coordinates with chiropractic treatment and focuses on holistic pain management and enhanced function. This ensures long-term solutions to your concerns rather than quick-fixes that do not address the root cause.

It is best to call the office of your chiropractor to learn more about accepted insurance plans. If you are planning to use insurance and would like to see a chiropractor, patients can learn more by checking in with their insurance provider to find out if they are eligible. Colorado Health and Wellness also offers payment plans for those who cannot use insurance. Our goal is to provide quality care while being the affordable chiropractor Colorado Springs residents can count on. Colorado Health and Wellness utilizes the latest chiropractic treatment methods, which are founded in traditional chiropractic. If you have questions about our approach, schedule an appointment! We'd love to share more information about what we have to offer here at our multidisciplinary clinic.

We provide physical therapy, nutrition counseling, electrical cell therapy for neuropathy (Sanexas), knee injections, and spinal decompression.

Our team has earned a variety of qualifications and licenses such as DC (Doctor of Chiropractic), MD (Medical Doctor), NP (Nurse Practitioner), and DPT (Doctor of Physical Therapy).
