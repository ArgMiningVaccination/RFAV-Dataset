Reiki is a Japanese technique for the relaxation and the reduction of stress. Reiki also promotes the healing of the body. It is natural and safe method of spiritual healing and self improvement that has been shown to be effective in helping virtually every known illness. Reiki works in tandem with other medical or therapeutic techniques to relieve side effects and promote recovery. During a standard reiki treatment, energy will flow from the practitioner's hands and into the patient. The patient will be laying comfortably on a massage table or chair and will be fully clothed. The reiki master will then place her hands on and near the body in a series of hand positions dependent upon the individual patient's needs. Each hand position is held for 3 to 10 minutes and the whole treatment lasts between 30 and 90 minutes. Benefits of Reiki Healing The benefits of reiki healing are numerable to say the least.
