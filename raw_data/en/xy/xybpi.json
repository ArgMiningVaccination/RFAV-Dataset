The web-based curriculum includes the following four courses: - DN 880 Dietary and Herbal Supplements (3 hours) - DN 881 Introduction to Dietetics and Integrative Medicine (3 hours) - DN 882 A Nutrition Approach to Inflammation and Immune Regulation (3 hours) - DN 980 Nutrigenomics and Nutrigenetics in Health and Disease (3 hours) Develop skills to partner with patients in making dietary supplement decisions. Explore the safe, efficacious use of botanicals and supplements in nutritional support of aging, maternal health and wellness. Discussions on supplementation in the prevention and treatment of chronic disease include: arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular, diabetes, digestive, mood and renal disorders. Prerequisite: Human physiology is advisable. Course offered each year, usually summer. Introduction to principles guiding the practice of integrative and functional medical nutrition therapy; clinical application of the nutrition care process (assessing, diagnosing, intervening, monitoring, and evaluating) toward restoring function for an individual client; focusing on the unique nutritional imbalances characteristic of chronic disease pathophysiology; supporting individuals with persistent symptoms; preventing chronic disease. Prerequisites: Introductory genetics, medical nutrition therapy, or consent of instructor. Course offered each year, usually fall. Inflammation and immune dysregulation is common in chronic disease. The course presents the integrative medicine approach to identify the underlying causes of inflammatory and immune-related conditions and associated nutritional influences; applies individualized nutritional interventions, as powerful modulators of the pathophysiology of inflammatory and immune responses. Prerequisites: Medical nutrition therapy, genetics or consent of instructor. Course offered once a year, usually spring. A review of nuclear receptors and their mechanisms of action with specific examples of regulation by nutrients (retinoids, fatty acids), amino acid control of gene expression, lipid sensors (PPARs), selenoprotein expression, and functional genomic studies (atherosclerosis, cancer, obesity, metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, inflammation) with relationships to nutrient intake and polymorphisms. Prerequisite: DN 836, 895 or 896 or permission of instructor. Course offered each year, usually summer. After Completing the Program As an advanced specialty program, KU's certificate in dietetic and integrative medicine does not provide eligibility for professional licensing for employment. Students enter this program having already obtained credentialing for health care practice. Vaccines and Clinical Site Requirements The University of Kansas Medical Center requires various immunizations for its students. For a detailed list please visit the [student health forms webpage](/academic-and-student-affairs/departments/student-health-services/forms.html) or speak with Student Health Services. These immunization requirements help promote health and safety and facilitate clinical placement. Many, if not all, clinical sites who partner with the University of Kansas Medical Center require proof of these vaccines for students engaged in training or other programmatic experiences at clinical sites. Not being vaccinated may preclude students from participating in activities, potentially impeding their ability to complete all program requirements for degree completion. Applicants with questions should speak with a representative from the academic program to which they intend to apply.
