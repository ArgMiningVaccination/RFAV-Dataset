Kate Brown pursuant to Ballot Measure 109, the Oregon Psilocybin Services Act , which is now codified in ORS 475A . OPAB is an advisory board whose duties include making recommendations to the Oregon Health Authority. OPAB has organized five subcommittees to focus on specific areas of interest during the development phase, January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, and to p rovide recommendations to OHA by June 30, 2022, per statute. A pproved recommendations are organized in this document by originating subcommittee and by the date of subcommittee approval . OPAB considered recommendations on 11/17/21, 12/21/21 4/27/22, 5/25/22 and 6/22/22. In some cases, the recommendations are very lengthy or refer to separate documents. The full text of these recommendations can be found in the appendices. TABLE OF CONTENTS Approved Recommendations Page 2 Appendix A \u2014Approved Nov.

A facilitator will not authorize a client to operate a vehicle after completing a psilocybin administration session. If previously arranged transportation is not available after the administration session, the facilitator will help the client make other arrangements, prioritizing the client's safety and well -being. T he facilitator will not be held responsible for a violation of this requirement if they take reasonable steps to discourage the client from driving. 2/10/22: Recommend adoption of content for client information form in Appendix G. (Recommendation amended d uring 6/22/23 OPAB meeting to reformat content as yes/no questions. ) 3/10/22: Recommend risk assessment framework to assess client suitability for psilocybin services.6 (Recommendation amended during 6/22/23 OPAB meeting to reconcile content with intake form and remove items that exceed scope of practice.) 3/10/22: Recommend safety plan framework for clients receiving psilocybin services.7 Training, 3/10/22: Recommend the following integration framework: Integration, as defined in the measure, will tak e place as a single in at least one session. A facilitator shall not engage in any activities with a client during the integration session that would require credentialing or licensure beyond the provider's Psilocybin Facilitator License. A facilitator may connect a client to further services, outside the regulated psilocybin service framework, in support of a client's ongoing integration needs. A facilitator may also self- refer a client to supportive services outside the regulated psilocybin service framew ork when the facilitator is credentialed or licensed to provide those services. An example would be a facilitator 1 See Appendix A for full text of recommendations 2 See Appendix A for full text of recommen dations 3 See Appendix A for full text of recommendations 4 See Appendix B for full text of recommendations 5 See Appendix D for full text of recommendations. 6 See appendix J for full text of risk assessment framework 7 See appendix J for full text of sa fety plan framework 3 who is also a licensed psychologist and, after the formal integration session, self- refers a client to ongoing \"integration therapy.\" Produ cts Subcommittee 9/23/21: Limit species to P.

This person need not be a licensed facilitator. 12/2/21: Recommend that a client's licensed facilitator shall always be present in the facilitation room or area and shall continuously monitor the client for the duration of an administrat ion session. The only permitted exceptions shall be short restroom or meal breaks in which the 6 client or facilitator temporarily steps out of the treatment room or area. Facilitators shall only take such breaks when the client is safe and comfortable. During short breaks, a second staff person shall monitor the client. Facilitators shall remain on the premises during meal breaks. 8/26/21: Recommend that group administration sessions be permitted subject to rule requirements. 9/9/21: Recommend that during ou tdoor administration sessions, facilitators have a duty to ensure client safety comfort and privacy.

As with all OPAB subcommittees, OPAB members may submit a request to join the Licensing Subcommittee. 10/21/21: Recommend that OHA ad opt the following language on license penalties: Denial, suspension, or revocation of licenses; restrictions on admission; penalties . (1) The Oregon Health Authority may assess a civil penalty and, pursuant to ORS 479.215, shall deny, suspend, or revoke a license, in any case where the State Fire Marshal, or the representative of the State Fire Marshal, certifies that there is a failure to comply with all applicable laws, lawful ordinances and rules relating to safety from fire. (2) The authority may: (a) Assess a civil penalty or deny, suspend, or revoke a license of psilocybin manufacturer, testing laboratory, service center, or facilitator in any case where it finds that there has been a substantial failure to comply with ORS [sections that pertain to M easure 109]. (b) Suspend or revoke a license issued under ORS [sections that pertain to Measure 109] for failure to pay a civil penalty imposed under ORS [relevant sections]. 7 10/21/21: Recommend that a psilocybin service center, or person acting in the interest of the center, may not take any disciplinary or other adverse action against any employee or facilitator who in good faith brings evidence of inappropriate care or any other violation of law or rules to the attention of the proper authority solely because of the employee or facilitator's action as described in this subsection. 10/21/21: Recommend that OHA adopt the following language on license responsibility: Service center staff and bylaws; rule s. (1) The licensee of a psilocybin service center shall be responsible for the operation of the facility, the selection of the staff and the quality of services rendered in the facility. The governing body shall: (a) Ensure that all personnel for whom st ate licenses, registrations or certificates are required are currently licensed, registered or certified; (b) Ensure that psilocybin facilitators licensed to practice in the facility are granted privileges consistent with their individual training, experie nce and other qualifications; (c) Ensure that procedures for granting, restricting and terminating privileges exist and that such procedures are regularly reviewed to ensure their conformity to applicable law; 8/26/21: Allow group administration sessions without limiting the total number of clients in a group, provided that the service center is compliant with building occupancy and other applicable state and local requirements. Licensing, 1/6/22: Recommend maximum client to facili tator ratio for group sessions of 8:1 for perceptual doses and 10:1 for subperceptual doses and require back up facilitator who is able to be present at the service center within 15 minutes . 10 1/6/22: Recommend that to reduce costs and increase the accessi bility of psilocybin services in Oregon: Group preparation sessions shall be permitted; Facilitators shall be permitted to conduct individual and group preparation sessions remotely, provided that the client agrees and has opportunities for one-on-one interaction with the facilitator; Group integration sessions shall be permitted and Facilitators shall be permitted to conduct individual and group integration sessions remotely, provided that the client agrees and has opportunities for one-on-one interact ion with the facilitator. Licensing, 1/6/22: Recommend that to promote equity and accessibility, while keeping costs down for facilitation students and training programs candidates for facilitator licenses: Shall be permitted to complete all portions of core facilitator training online through either synchronous or asynchronous learning; Shall be permitted to complete up to 50% of practical facilitator training online through synchronous or asynchronous learning; and Shall be permitted to comp lete 100% of practical facilitator training online if at least 50% of the practical training is completed synchronously. Licensing, 9/9/21: Recommend requiring fiduciary duties of loyalty, care and confidentiality that facilitators owe to clients. 10 Note: License SC recommended 3:1 ratio on 8/26/21; that recommendation was rejected at 5/25/22 OPAB 8 12/2/21: Recommend that supportive touch, such as holding a client's hand or placing a hand on a client's shoulder, shall be permitted provided that the informed consent of the client has been appropriately obtained and documented before the administration session begins. Sexual or romantic contact between facilitators and clients or contact that may reasonably be construed as sexual or romantic, shall be prohibited and shall be grounds for an investigation and potential license revocation. 1/6/22: Adopt 1/2/22 dr aft of the ethical principles/code of conduct for psilocybin facilitators for consideration by the full Psilocybin Advisory Board .11 10/21/21: Recommend that the Client Bill of Rights should be posted in a prominent place visible to clients in every service center.12 12/2/21: Recommend that clients may leave an administration session before it has concluded. However, in such cases, the facilitator shall advise the client that they are leaving before the session has concluded (against the advice of the facilitator), record this information in the client record, ask the client to sign a form acknowledging that they are leaving against the facilitator's advice, and take reasonable efforts to ensure that the client has a trusted person transport them home safely. Though clients may leave an administration session before it has concluded, facilitators may not prematurely conclude an administration session. An administration session is concluded prematurely if continuing the session is necessary to ensure the safety of the client and the public. o 12/2/21: Recommend that the client informed consent document shall be updated to inform clients of the requirements of the preceding motion as part of the informed consent process. 11/4/21: Approve draft informed conse nt document presented during meeting and move the document to the full Psilocybin Advisory Board for consideration.13 12/2/21: Recommend that to reduce the costs associated with psilocybin services, and maximize accessibility of the Oregon model, there shall be no minimum or maximum duration for administration sessions. The length of each administration session may depend on several factors such as the dose and type of psilocybin products administered, the goals of the client, whether the client ha s trustworthy transportation to take them home, and the degree to which the administered psilocybin products are affecting the client's physical abilities and cognitive function. Considering these factors, the facilitator shall determine when an administration session has concluded, and if, in the facilitator's professional judgement, continuing an administration session is unnecessary to ensure the safety of the client and the public, then the facilitator may conclude the administration session and shall record the time at which the session concluded in the client record. Framing the required duration of administration sessions in this manner leaves room for the administration of subperceptual doses of psilocybin products while allowing administration sessions to be completed in less time (compared to the time required to complete sessions in which higher doses of psilocybin products are administered). 10/7/21: Recommend that there be no waivers for the licensing exam. 10/21/21: Require that t o receive a psi locybin facilitator license, candidates must pass a multiple -choice exam (the licensing exam) that evaluates knowledge of concepts included in the 11 See Appendix E for code of conduct document 12 See Appendix J for complete text of Client Bill of Rights as adopted by OPAB 5/25 13 See Appendix D for informed consent document 9 training curriculum, the text of Measure 109, documents produced by the licensing subcommittee, and rules ado pted by OHA. 10/21/21: Recommend that the licensing exam should be developed and maintained by OHA and OPAB and its subcommittees. The Licensing Subcommittee may seek the advice of outside experts who may contribute to the process as needed. 10/21/21: Reco mmend that candidates should be permitted to take the licensing exam at home using remotely proctored administration software that protects candidate privacy and is accessible to people with disabilities. 10/21/21: Recommend that the licensing exam should be made available in multiple languages and in alternate formats that promote accessibility. 10/21/21: Recommend that the cost of registering for the licensing exam should be no higher than is necessary to maintain the testing program, and fee waivers sho uld be offered to increase accessibility 10 Appendix A\u2014Training Subcommittee Recommendations Adopted by OPAB on 11/17/21 DEFINTION For Training Subcommittee recommendations, the terms \"program\" and 'training program' shall mean a comprehensive training program.

At least 50% of Core Training not conducted in- person shall be conveyed through online synchronous learning. Synchronous Learning means that students learn from their instructor at the same time as their fellow students. 3. Core Training will devote specified minimum hours to each of the following subject areas: Historical, Traditional, and Contemporary Plant Medicine Practices and Applications (12) Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in relation to Psilocybin Services (12) Safety, Ethics and Responsibilities of a Psilocybin Facilitator (10) Psilocybin Pharmacology, Neuroscience, and Clinical Research (12) Core Psilocybin Facilitation Skills (16) Conducting a Psilocybin Preparation and Orientation Session (16) Conducting a Psilocybin Administration Session (20) Conducting Psilocybin Integration (14) Group Psilocybin Facilitation (8) 4. Programs shall require students to complete practicum training. The goal of practicum training is to provide students the opportunity to facilitate and observe the facilitation of non- ordinary states of consciousness. Over time, and as the number of licens ed Service Centers and qualified supervisors allows, practicum training shall include placement at a Practicum Site where students shall observe and facilitate psilocybin services under the supervision of a Practicum Site Supervisor. In cases in which a 11 Practicum Site is not reasonably available or accessible to students, a training program will identify and facilitate alternative training for students to fulfill the practicum requirement and describe to the Oregon Health Authority how this alternative trai ning reasonably approximates training at a Practicum Site. Students shall complete a minimum of 40 hours of practicum training, including at least 30 hours of direct practice, and at least 10 hours of consultation relating to the student's direct practice. a. Practicum Site: A licensed Psilocybin Service Center or other designated site approved by the Oregon Health Authority to provide practicum training. b. Practicum Site Supervisor (Site Supervisor): An onsite practicum supervisor of assigned trainees, affilia ted with a Practicum Site. It is the primary responsibility of the Site Supervisor to develop the trainee's practicum skills and evaluate a trainee's practicum performance, focusing on direct services with clients / participants. 5. Partial Training Programs may be approved by the Oregon Health Authority to offer specific Core Training to students while not providing all Core Training. Partial Training Programs must clearly identify to prospective students that they do not offer all required Core Training. If a program grants Accelerated Training hours to students, it must also accept transfer credits from Partial Training Programs. Partial training programs are not subject to the requirement that their students complete practicum training. 14 6. Training programs can either categorically accept or not categorically accept transfer hours from all Partial Training Programs. Training programs cannot accept transfer hours from one or some Partial Training Programs while denying transfer hours from others. 15 7. Comprehensive training programs shall have more than one Lead Educator on staff. All presenters of the curriculum affiliated with a training program, whether Lead Educators, contracted specialists, or guest speakers, shall have significant relevant experience and/or education in the subject areas on which they are presenting. Partial Training Programs are not required to have more than one Lead Educator. a. Lead Educator: An educator affiliated with a training program who provides Core Training to students and tracks the progress of students throughout the program. 8. Each training program shall identify a Program Director who has authority to confer student enrollment and program completion. 9. Training programs shall maintain a level of training for students such that students who successfully complete the program's training could reasonably expect to possess the knowledge and skills required to pass the state licensing exam and practice in good standing as a licensed facilitator. 14 Equity subcommittee considered an identical recommendation on 11/3/21 15 Equity subcommittee consid ered an identical recommendation on 11/3/21 12 10.

Programs shall train students in pharmacology related to psilocybin, supporting students to understand: Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of psilocybin How various medications and supplements, including MAO inhibitors and SSRI's, can interact with psilocybin The metabolism of psilocybin and psilocybin products 4. Programs shall train students in basic neuroscience relating to psilocybin, supporting students to understand: The concept of neuroplasticity and neurogenesis The primary effects of psilocybin on the brain, including connectivity in and between areas in the brain, such as effects on the Default Mode Network Current theories on mechanisms of action of psilocybin 5. Programs shall train students in key areas of research, including, but not limited to: Depression and Treatment Resistant Depression Substance Use Concerns End of Life / Palliative / Existential Distress Anxiety Trauma Spirituality Enhancements relating to measures of wellness, such as well -being, pro -social behavior, creativity, eco -mindedness, openness, and connectedness Emerging research in the field 14 6.

Programs shall train students in how to prepare clients for psilocybin use in a manner that ensures informed consent, safety planning, and promotes an understanding of the boundaries between the facilitator and the client. 11. Programs shall train students to recognize their scope of practice, how to relate scope of practice to a Client Information Form, how to identify clients in need of referral to specialized treatment services, and how to provide such referrals in a timely manner. 12. Programs shall train s tudents to have the capacity to evaluate a standardized Client Information Form to help determine whether and under what circumstances a client is an appropriate candidate for psilocybin services, what should be included in safety planning, and whether a client's needs fall under a facilitator's scope of practice. 13. Programs shall train students to have the capacity to conduct an intake interview for the purpose of establishing a trusting alliance with a client and evaluating a client's readiness for psilo cybin services. 14. Programs shall train students to determine a client's goodness of fit with a facilitator, based on information on a standardized Client Information Form, a facilitator's scope of practice, the strength of the alliance between the client and facilitator, and a facilitator and client's assessment of the appropriateness of psilocybin services for the client at the current time. 15. Programs shall train students to understand various dosing strategies and considerations, taking into account: Exper iential differences relating to differing dosages Physiological considerations in relation to dosage Delivery mechanisms of psilocybin Use of secondary doses 15 16 16. Programs shall train students in the foundations of traumatic stress (individual and systemic), including how it's stored in the body, how it can manifest during the psilocybin experience, and what to do in these circumstances. Programming will help students to: Understand that trauma is embedded in the body Identify repressed trauma rising to the surface of consciousness during a psilocybin experience Identify intergenerational trauma and traumatic stress resulting from systemic oppression Create safety for trauma resolution Understand the risks associated with re-traumatization resulting from the psilocybin experience Use self -regulatory skills in response to a client's trauma reaction 17. Programs shall train students in skills needed to serve as an empathic presence for clients, including an ability to sustain a nondirective facilitation approach and a nonjudgmental and accepting disposition, to suspend attention evenly over the course of a session, to communicate clearly and compassionately, to respond to distress with calmness, and to monitor interpersonal boundaries. a. Nondirective Facilitation: An approach to facilitation in which the facilitator maintains a consistent, warm, and affirming disposition with a client, while avoiding giving the client direct advice or directly interpreting a client's statements or behaviors. The goal of nondirective facilitation is for clients to discover things about themselves for themselves with minimal guidance from a facilitator. Pace and direction is controlled by the client. An exception would be when safety is at stake, at which point it may be incumbent on a facilitator to become directive in the service of safety. 18. Programs shall train students to identify and facilitate a variety of subjective psilocybin experiences, including experiences relating to bodily sensations, cognitive processes, emotional states, spiritual and mystical states, and traumatic memories. 19. Programs shall train students to demonstrate skills necessary to safely and effectively facilitate non- ordinary states of consciousness during a personal process of transformation, including, but not limited to: Reflective listening Discerning when to intervene and when to step back during a client's experience Resisting the urge to impose meaning upon a client's experience Ethically navigating power differ entials between facilitator and client Demonstrating a capacity to create a safe container for difficult or intense thoughts, emotions, and experiences Understanding when and how a client may need additional support or a higher level of care 17 20. Programs shal l train students to develop an understanding of the optimal use of environmental components within a psilocybin administration session, including, but not limited to, space, lights, smells, decor, comfort, access to bathroom, and minimization of outside -session distractions. 21. Programs shall train students in a trauma- informed manner on how to safely manage and reduce potential harms related to difficult or adverse behavioral or medical responses that may arise as a result of psilocybin ingestion. a. Adverse Behavioral Response means behavior engaged in by a b. client during an administration or integration session that endangers c. the safety of the client, the Facilitator, or others whom the client encounters or may reasonably encounter. d. Adverse Medical Re sponse means a physiological reaction of a client during an administration session the continuation of which could lead to medical harm. 22. Programs shall train students to develop characteristics and skills related to effectively working with challenging be haviors during session, such as: Calmness Empathic presence and nonjudgmental listening Non- directive communication skills Knowing when and how to be directive in support of safety Recognizing signs of medical distress and knowing when and how to seek support if there are safety concerns beyond the facilitator's scope of practice 23. Programs shall train students to demonstrate an understanding of skills, processes, and criteria involv ed in completing a psilocybin administration session, including an ability to discern when and how to initiate and document completion of the administration session, and how to facilitate this transition with a client. 24. Programs shall train students on proper integration tools, techniques, and resources available to help clients process their psilocybin experiences. 25. Programs shall train students to articulate the goals of an integration session, including, but not limited to: Exploration of negative feelings from psilocybin session Facilitation of positive internal and external changes Enhancement of existing supportive relationships Maintenance of trust and positive connection between client and facilitator 18 26. Programs shall train students t o use open -ended questions that support effective integration, including those relating to: Memories from the psilocybin experience Positive and challenging aspects of the psilocybin experience Role of previously identified intention during the experience How the experience might affect a client's relationships How the client can incorporate new insights and breakthroughs into daily life 27. Programs shall train students to demonstrate skills required to facilitate an effective and safe psilocybin group session, including, but not limited to: Screening a participant for compatibility with group format Facilitating group rapport Establishing a sense of safety within the group Discussing group agreements, including confidentiality, boundaries, ethics, and communication rules Facilitating group cohesion, belonging, and safety Identifying when an individual within a group requires one -to-one support, removal from a group, or additional intervention SUPPLEMENTARY RECCOMENDATIONS 1.

STUDENT MASTERY OF EQUITY IN CORE MATERIALS (See attached doc for detail and defintions ) 1) Recommend that OHA require training programs to have a means to measure student proficiency in cultural equity, racial justice, and the ethics of relational care 6 and reciprocity 21 Appendix B\u2014Equity Subcommittee Recommendations Adopted by OPAB on 11/17/21 DETAIL: General question to consider: How do we institutionalize and codify the ways in which Facilitator Training Programs demonstrate equity? Note: items highlighted indicate terms or concepts requiring further development. Additional notes and details about these items can be found in the footnotes that accompany them. Ensuring Equity In Core Materials OAR should require Facilitator Training Programs to: Orient learners to the meanings of cultural equity1 and racial justice2, and to the ethics of relational care and reciprocity, and use these core competencies as the framework to develop and present all core modules. Teach \"cultural equity\" as a core module, and include in this module a historical accounting of systemic inequity and intergeneration al trauma, particularly highlighting: Cultural equity and its relationship to health equity3 Cultural equity and its relationship with environmental and racial justice The rationalization of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and psilocybin prohibi tion The War on Drugs of 1971 including who it impacts and its effects on cultural and health equity today Social power and privilege, their misuse, and who they impact and their effects on cultural and health equity today Decolonization4 and cultura l appropriation 1 \"Cultural equity\" means [the embodiment of values, policies, and practices that ensure that all people, especially those who have been historically marginalized based on race, ethnicity, language, disability, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, social class, intersections among these communities or identities, or other socially determined circumstances, are represented in the development of social pathways to health 22 equity] 2 \"Racial justice\" means [the restitutional fairness in the treatment of racially marginalized people by way of eliminating discriminatory and systemic barriers and creating new pathways for the same in order to ensure health equity for people of all races] 3 \"Health equity\" means [the assuredness of access to full health and wellbeing for all people despite differences and disadvantages created by designations of race, ethnicity, language, disability, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, social class, intersections among these communities or identities, or other socially determined circumstances]. See OHA's definition of Health Equity. 4 \"Decolonization\" means [unlearning the thinking, practices, and societal systems that assert western superiority over traditional and Indigenous governance, knowledge and practices. Decolonization requires dismantling systems and structures that assert pow er and control, and cause harm by the dominant culture, making repairs for the damages done, and returning to a culture which honors and centers Indigenous sovereignty and justice] Teach \"historical, traditional knowledge and practices\" as a core module and include in this module the following topics: Historical, traditional knowledge and practices including: origin, Indigenous lineage, ceremonial and other traditional practices across cultivation and preservation, harvesting and preparation, and administr ation and experience The impact of historical, traditional knowledge and practices on today's modes and standards of use Western exposure and 20th century research, study, and practices Cover Trauma Informed Care16, broader concepts of trauma includin g the physiology of trauma, and how physiology generally shapes all experiences including the experience of trauma. Cover community - and self -care, addressing vicarious trauma, vicarious resilience, empathic stress, compassion fatigue, and compassion satisfaction. The Psilocybin Services Program, by rule or by policy, should orient Facilitator Training Programs and their learners to Measure 109 and its impacts on and intersection with Measure 110. The Psilocybin Services Program, by rule, should require training in basic CPR for all facilitators and look into the opportunities and implications of dual tracking with Traditional Health Workers or Community Health Workers. 16 \"Trauma Informed Care\" means [ ] vs. \"Trauma Focused Care\" which means [ ] 23 Ensuring Student Mastery of Equity in Core Materials OAR should require that Facilitator Training Programs: Have a means to measure student proficiency in cultural equity, racial justice, and the ethics of relational care17 and reciprocity. Proficiency should demonstrate the following: Value and respect for cultural, individual, and role differences, including those due to race, ethnicity, language, disability, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, social class, intersections among these communities or identities, or other socially determined circumstances. Awarene ss and knowledge of cultural equity and racial justice, the difference between the two, and the meaning of inclusion, including contextual and systemic dynamics related to inequities due to race, ethnicity, language, disability, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, social class, intersections among these communities or identities, or other socially determined circumstances. Awareness and skills to become accountable and create repair18 when they have misused or abused their privileges due to race, ethnicity, language, disability, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, social class, intersections among these communities or identities, or other socially determined circumstances. Ensuring Equity in Program Business and Operating Practi ces OAR should require that Facilitator Training Programs: Develop and maintain social equity plans19-plans encompassing internal and external equity strategies -as a condition of approval. Social equity plans should, at minimum, present a well- defined miss ion and describe the ways Programs will 1) integrate equity (e.g., DEI) throughout their internal practices, policies, and programming; 2) participate in and support the Psilocybin 17 \"Relational care\" means [to support the personal needs, growth, and wellbeing of others, particularly of those going through temporal crises such as houselessness, illness, marginalization, stigmatization, ostracization., etc.] 18 Some models of repair include, but are not limited to, [ ] 19 Criteria and administrative oversight details TBD 24 Service Program's equity efforts; and 3) monitor, measure, and report again st proposed key performance indicators. Advise new trainers applying to their Programs to demonstrate through their CV how they have been involved in promoting equity, diversity and inclusion and list what they have done in these areas. Maintain continuing education for their leadership and staff in the areas of cultural equity, decolonization and racial justice. Meet social equity plan KPIs, maintain continuing education, report the evaluations of student proficiency in equity, and report student satisfact ion assessments as a condition for Program renewal. The Psilocybin Services Program, by rule or by policy, should prioritize the approval of Facilitator Training Programs that have a diverse group of trainers (according to race, ethnicity, language, disability, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, social class, intersections among these communities or identities, or other socially determined circumstances); and that have diversity target goals and strategies for the recruitment and retention of diverse staff trainers in their social equity plans. Ensuring Equity in Economic Opportunity OAR should require that the Psilocybin Services Program: Prioritize Oregon -based and Oregon -owned Facilitator Training Programs, Programs that are owned by culturally marginalized people and those directly impacted by the War on Drugs, and Programs that demonstrate diversity in their trainers and staff. Programs that demonstrate all three criteria should have a highest priority for acceptance. Charg e application fees to non -Oregon Programs that build a fund to support the development and maintenance of Programs owned by culturally marginalized people and those directly impacted by the War on Drugs so that these Programs may succeed. Examples of suppo rt include: Grants and low interest rate small business loans Technical assistance and business support services Require Programs to identify their business relationships and funding sources, including connections with venture capital. 25 Ensuring Equit y in Training Access OAR should require that the Psilocybin Services Program: Charge application fees to non -Oregon Programs that build a fund to support culturally and economically disadvantaged students' enrollment in Facilitator Training Programs. Examples of support include: Grants and scholarships The Psilocybin Services Program, by rule or by policy, should work to provide access to Facilitator Training Programs through public and private sector agencies and organizations that offer free train ing programs available to culturally marginalized people. OPAB should work to build connections and rapport with accreditation organizations so that in the future there may be federal accreditation of the Programs to provide access to federal student loan and grant money. OAR shall require that Facilitator Training Programs: Offer translation services for programmatic documents and lectures for students for whom English is a second language, or offer reduced fees so students may purchase interpretation them selves. Offer academic and physical accommodation in Facilitation Training Programs for people living with disabilities to guarantee academic equity. Offer reduced fees for applicants with disabilities who are receiving state assistance. Offer other forms of experiential learning to those who are unable to undergo a facilitated psilocybin experience due to contraindicated medical conditions. Ensuring Equity in Community The Psilocybin Services Program and OPAB should work to answer these additional question s: How does the Psilocybin Services Program integrate, support, and make accessible community - based peer support groups and networks for clients, facilitators, and Service Center staff, especially those consisting of culturally marginalized people? 26 What ro le, if any, can the Psilocybin Services Program play in helping people, and especially those identifying as culturally marginalized, learn how to establish peer support groups to be made available for clients, facilitators, and Service Center staff? How do es the Psilocybin Services Program facilitate connections between clients, facilitators, Service Center staff, Service Centers, and community -based peer support groups, and in a way that doesn't over professionalize community -based services? How are facili tators and Service Centers protected when referring clients to community -based peer support groups? How can the Psilocybin Services Program facilitate learning from and sharing with community - based peer support groups? 27 Appendix C\u2014Equity Subcommittee's Product Recommendations, Adopted by OPAB 11/17/21 1. Recommend that rules create a list of prohibited additives and ingredients. 2. Direct OHA and the Psilocybin Services Program to maintain a list, with scientific citations, of allowable and prohibited food, food ingredients, and additives that may potentiate, attenuate, or affect the onset of action or duration of action of psilocybin. 3.

You should receive this informed consent form at the start of your preparatory session. During the session, your facilitator will discuss the form with you. Please ensure that you read and understand every section because you must sign the form before the preparatory session concludes. If you do not understand any part of this document, please ask your facilitator for clarification before signing. Statement on Data Collection: While receiving psilocybin services, you may be asked to contribute information for research purposes. Efforts will be made to protect the security and confidentiality of your information, such as th e deidentification of your data, consistent with standards of medical care and research. However, there is a risk the information could be used to identify you and reveal that you have received psilocybin services. If you agree to share your information, t hen data collected about you by your facilitator may be shared with people and institutions outside the psilocybin service center. If you would prefer that your information not be shared for these purposes, then you should not agree, and your information w ill only be shared if permitted or required by law. Your decision will not affect your ability to receive psilocybin services. I have been informed of and understand the following: (Please initial each item below) 1. ____ I have been provided with a copy of t he Psilocybin Services Client Bill of Rights, my facilitator has explained it to me, and I understand my rights as a client. 2. ____ I understand that psilocybin services do not constitute medical diagnosis or treatment. 3. ____ I understand that Psilocybin has not been approved by the FDA for marketing as a drug, and the federal government currently classifies psilocybin as a Schedule I controlled substance. 31 a. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Schedule I controlled substances have (1) a high potential for abuse; and (2) no currently accepted medical use. b. Federal law prohibits the manufacture, distribution, and possession of psilocybin even in cities and states that have modified their laws to allow its possession or use. c. Despite its federal Schedule I status, research suggests that psilocybin is very unlikely to be addictive. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has designated psilocybin a \"breakthrough therapy\" for major depressive disorder and treatment resistant depression, which means p silocybin may be a significant improvement over current FDA approved therapy. Additionally, randomized controlled clinical trials and peer reviewed medical literature suggest that psilocybin may improve symptoms of depression, anxiety, end of life distress , various forms of trauma, and problematic substance use. Participants also report improvements in mental and spiritual wellbeing. 4. ____ I understand that while existing research has shown promising results, the risks, benefits, and drug interactions of ps ilocybin are not fully understood, and individual results may vary. During clinical trials, participants may have received more preparatory, administration, and integration sessions, and clients should use caution when using the results of research to pred ict the nature of their experience when receiving psilocybin services. 5. ____ I understand that some people find psilocybin administration sessions challenging and uncomfortable. Common potential side effects include mild and transient headache, fatigue, anxiety, confusion, increased blood pressure, elevated heart rate, paranoia, perceptual changes, altered thought patterns, reduced inhibitions, unmasking of repressed memories and traumas, and altered perception of time and one's surroundings. If they occur, these side effects are usually mild and temporary. However, because the potential risks and benefits of psilocybin administration are not fully understood, there may be unanticipated side effects. 6. ____ I understand that less common, and potentially more s erious side effects may include dizziness, fainting, and changes in heart rhythm (arrythmia) such as QT prolongation. 7. ____ I understand that if I am taking prescription medications or have a chronic medical condition including, but not limited to, heart d isease, kidney disease, or liver disease, I should check with my doctor before being administered psilocybin. 32 8. ____ I understand that people diagnosed with certain mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, may be at increased risk for serious side effects during or following the administration of psilocybin. 9. ____ I understand that some people are allergic to mushrooms, and psilocybin is sometimes derived from mushrooms. If I have a known mushroom allergy, I should check with my doctor before being administered psilocybin. 10. ____ I understand that the effects of psilocybin during pregnancy and breastfeeding are unknown. 11. ____ I understand that facilitators may use different types of touch while providing psilocybin services and that certain types of touch may be unavoidable. My facilitator has had a thorough discussion about which types of touch are acceptable to me prior to the start of my psilocybin administration session. 12. ____ I understand that if I disclose instances of child or sexual abuse to my facilitator, or information that may put me or another person at risk of imminent harm, my facilitator may be required by law to report my statements to police and other authorities. 13. ____ I agree not to drive, operate heavy machinery, or engage in any activities that require alertness or quick responses for at least 24 hours after psilocybin administration. 14. ____ I understand that being administered psilocybin is completely voluntary a nd I may decide not to receive psilocybin at any time. 15. ____ I understand that if I agree to share my information for research purposes, then data collected by my facilitator may be shared with people and institutions outside the psilocybin service center . Efforts will be made to protect the security and confidentiality of my information, such as the deidentification of my data, consistent with standards of medical care and research. However, there is a risk the information could be used to identify me and reveal that I have received psilocybin services. If I do not want my information to be used for research, then I should decline to share my data. I may still receive psilocybin services, and my data will only be shared to the extent permitted or required by law. 16. ____ I understand that for my own safety, leaving a psilocybin service center during an administration session once it has begun is not recommended. Doing so could expose me to safety and legal risks. 17. ____ I understand and have been informed of t he potential benefits, risks, and complications of psilocybin services with my facilitator to the extent that they are known. 33 18. ____ I have had the opportunity to ask questions regarding anything I may not understand or that I believe should be clarified. ____________________ Name (Print) ________________________ ________________________ Signature Date 34 Appendix , 1/6/22 Principles/Code of Conduct for Psilocybin Facilitators 1. Ge neral principle. Beneficence and nonmaleficence: All facilitators shall strive to benefit others, to do no harm, and to safeguard the welfare of clients. 2. Fiduciary Duties. Fiduciary duties are intended to protect the more vulnerable parties in relationships where one party has greater expertise and influence. Facilitators owe clients fiduciary duties including, but not limited to, the duties of loyalty, care, and confidentiality. Duty of Loyalty: While acting in the role of fiduciary, facilitators have a duty to put their clients' interests above their own. When soliciting a client's consent for psilocybin services, facilitators shall have a duty to disclose all information that is material to the client's decision, including but not limited to, any personal or financial interests unrelated to the client's welfare that may affect the facilitator's judgement. Should such information arise after consent is obtained, the facilitator has an ongoing duty to disclose it to the client. Duty of Care: Facilitators have a dut y to use the degree of skill, knowledge, and care that other reasonably careful licensed facilitators would use in the same or similar circumstances. Facilitators shall understand the laws and regulations governing the provision of psilocybin services, com ply with the facilitator's professional code of conduct, and complete the continuing education necessary to maintain the requisite level of skill, knowledge, and care. Duty of Confidentiality: Facilitators have a duty to maintain the confidentiality of c lient information. When disclosure of client information may be permitted under Section 56 of the Oregon Psilocybin Services Act, facilitators should attempt to maintain the confidentiality of client information to the greatest extent possible, and if compliance can be achieved without disclosing client information, the facilitator should avoid disclosure. 3. Misconduct and Responsibility for the Acts of Others It is professional misconduct for a facilitator to: a. Violate this code of conduct, knowingly induce another to do so, or to do so through the acts of another; b. Commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the facilitator's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness to provide psilocybin services; 35 c. Engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; A facilitator shall be responsible for another facilitator's violation of this code of conduct if: a. The facilitator orders or, with the knowledge of the specific conduct, observes, condones, or approves the conduct inv olved; or 36 b. The facilitator has direct supervisory authority over the other facilitator and knows of the conduct at the time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take reasonable remedial action. Facilitators who observe or ratify the mis conduct of another facilitator shall report the misconduct to the OHA within 7 calendar days . 4. Privacy and Confidentiality. Facilitators have an obligation to protect confidential client information obtained during their work. Unless required by law , disclosures of client information shall be made only with a client's written consent. Facilitators shall not disclose confidential client information when consulting with colleagues or with other clients. Limits of confidentiality should be discussed wi th clients, including under what conditions confidential information is legally required to be released. 5. Competence. Facilitators shall demonstrate successful completion of an OHA approved training program that meets training standards set by OHA. Facilitators shall only provide services within the boundaries of their competence (scope of practice), based on education, training, and licensure. Facilitators shall undertake relevant education, training, supervision, and consultation when providing techniques or services that are new to them. Facilitators shall participate in ongoing training or continuing education to maintain competence. 6. Contacting Emergency Services. Facilitators shall acknowledge that due to the stigmatization and current l egal status of psilocybin, contacting police and other emergency responders can pose unique risks to client safety and privacy. Accordingly, facilitators shall have safety plans in place that reduce the need to contact emergency responders. Nevertheless, f acilitators must learn to distinguish benign side effects of psilocybin services from medical emergencies, and when true emergencies arise, they shall contact emergency responders. In those circumstances, facilitators have ongoing fiduciary duties to clients requiring facilitators to minimize potential harms to clients associated with contacting and involving first responders. 7. Dual/Multiple Relationships. When a facilitator sees a client with whom they have an existing relationship, or sees a person closely associated with a client, this creates a dual relationship. The conflation of personal relationships with the provision of psilocybin services can be problematic and may impair the facilitator's objectivity or effectiveness. 37 Facilitators should not provide services to people over whom they have supervisory, evaluative, or other authority (e.g., students, employees). 38 When a facilitator serves a client with whom they have a previous or existing relationship, great care should be taken to delineate between professional and personal roles and respect and understand the vulnerable position of clients receiving psilocybin services. A facilitator shall not offer or render psilocybin services as a means of establishing a personal relationship with clients. 8. Record Keeping. Facilitators shall create and maintain records of services provided to meet service center requirements, to document client response to psilocybin services, for accurate billing, and for the maintenance of licensure. Facilitator records shall include: Completed Client Information Form Completed Informed Consent Form for each round of psilocybin services Start and stop time of each preparatory, administration, and integration session The identity, dose, and batch number of the psilocybin product(s) administered during each administration session Adverse outcomes 9. Maintenance, dissemination, and disposal of confidential records Facilitators shall store client information in accordance with the following rules: Client records must be stored and maintained for a minimum of 5 years. To prevent unauthorized access and protect client confident iality, records shall be stored in a manner that meets or exceeds HIPAA standards. With reasonable notice, facilitators shall allow clients to access, review, and correct their records. Records should only be destroyed in a manner that maintains client confidentiality, such as a commercial shredding service. After maintaining a client's records for 5 years, facilitators shall destroy those records upon receiving a written request from clients for their records' destruction. 10. Fees and Financial Arrangements. Agreement between client and facilitator regarding fees, and any other financial arrangements, shall be recorded in writing prior to the provision of psilocybin services. 11. Advertising and other public statements. Facilitators shall not make false, deceptive, or misleading statements and shall take reasonable efforts to prevent others from making false, deceptive, or misleading statements on their behalf. Facilitators providing public advice (in person, in print, or on the internet, etc.) shall take precautions to ensure statements are based on training and experience and are consistent with this code of ethics. 39 Facilitators shall not solicit testimonials from clients. 12. Resolving Ethical Issues. Facilitators and members of the public shall submit complaints to an ethics/licensing committee that receives complaints from the public, adjudicates/investigates complaints, and has the power to revoke licenses or mandate remedies. 13. Special considerations for non- ordinary states of consciousness Clients may be especially open to suggestion, manipulation, or exploitation, and because the effects of psychedelics can persist for months, this state of vulnerability may be prolonged, which requires increased attention to safety and consent. Psilocybin facilitation has the potential for stronger, more subtle, more complicated transference (strong feelings a client projects onto a provider; for example, as a parental figure) and counter transference (strong feelings a provider feels toward a client). This potential dynamic requires facilitators to be self -awareness, to engage in self -reflection and self -examination, and when possible, to participate in supervision/peer support for facilitators. 14. Non- Directive Approach to Facilitation of Psilocybin Services Facilitators shall provide psilocybin services, which consist of preparation, administration, and integration sessions, in a non- directive manner. The non- directive approach to facilitation is charac terized by maintenance of a consistent, warm, and affirming disposition with clients, while avoiding giving clients direct advice or directly interpreting their statements or behaviors. The goal of nondirective facilitation is for clients to discover thing s about themselves for themselves with only minimal guidance from a facilitator. The pace and direction of facilitation are controlled by clients, while facilitators serve in a supportive role. An exception would be when safety is at stake, at which point facilitators shall become directive only in the service of safety. 15. Use of Touch Clients may want or benefit from a facilitator's reassuring touch during the administration session. Facilitators shall complete training regarding the appropriate use of touch and demonstrate an acceptable level of understanding regarding the context and boundaries for appropriate touch. Facilitators shall discuss the use of touch with clients before the start of each administration session, and permission to use touch shall be requested and recorded. 16. Romantic and Sexual Relationships No romantic relationships, sexual contact, or sexual intimacy with clients is permitted during any stage of psilocybin services including preparatory, administration, and integration sessions. In addition, sexual contact or romantic relationships with clients, or their partners or immediate family members, is prohibited for one year after the facilitator -client relationship has been formally terminated. 40 17. Storage and Diversion of Psilocybin Products Facilitators shall store psilocybin products in accordance with OHA administrative rules and shall have a duty to prevent their adulteration, contamination, or diversion from psilocybin service centers. 18. Acknowledgements This code of conduct was inspired by ethical codes of the American Counseling Association, the American Psychological Association, and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). 41 Appendix G\u2014Proposed Social Equity Framework, adopted by Equity Subcommittee 1/21/22 CONSIDERATIONS FOR MANUFACTURING & SERVICE CENTER LICENSE HOLDERS OHA shall require that applicants for manufacturing and service center licenses develop Social Equity Plans as part of their application for licensure. OHA shall require that licensed manufacturers and service centers maintain Social Equity Plans as a condition of renewal. Social Equity Plans shall encompass internal and external equity strategies and shall be commensurate to the size of the organization. At minimum, Social Equity Plans shall include a well -defined mission and description of the ways license holders will accomplish the following: Integrate DEJI throughout their internal practices, policies, and programming Participate in and support any Psilocybin Services Program's equity efforts, including the implementation and support of any future equity program Monitor, measure, and report against stated key performance indicators (KPIs) as defined in the Social Equity Plan Social Equity Plans shall include a forecast of incremental KPIs (milestones) that advance the license holders' Social Equity Plan. 42 License holders shall submit an annual report detailing the implementation and management of their Social Equity Plans, including the following: Plan summary Narrative of activity to date Evaluation of each KPI Successes Challenges Assessment of internal and external impact Future plans and opportunities Opportunities for policy and regulation changes OHA shall report and highlight SEP impacts (spotlight, rank on efficacy and best practices) OHA shall review SEPs each renewal period, provide an assessment of the plan's efficacy and the organization's achievement of stated goals, and make a determination on whether the organization's license may be renewed, put on an improvement plan, or discontinued. CONSIDERATIONS FOR FACILITATOR LICENSE HOLDERS Require continuing education in cultural equity, racial justice, and health equity as part of facilitator renewals.
