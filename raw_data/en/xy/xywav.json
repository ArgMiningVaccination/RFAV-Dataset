Natural medicines have been used for ages - doctors in ancient Rome, the druids in the British isles, doctors in China, native peoples in the Americas all used natural medicines derived from plants to effectively treat pain and other symptoms of illnesses. In the 18th century, a German doctor named Samuel Hahnemann became very concerned that many of the then \"scientific\" modes of treating illness (such as blood-letting with leaches) had excessive side-effects and dubious efficacy. He studied the use of micro doses of thousands of natural substances and discovered that a select few helped the human body resolve symptoms of many illnesses ... and in an exceptionally safe way. He called his approach \"homeopathy\".

Reckeweg, the most luminous figure in homeopathy of the last century. He advanced the thinking of Dr. Hahnemann by discovering that combining multiple, carefully curated herbal extracts, a remedy can deliver higher levels of relief of more symptoms compared to the traditional homeopathic approach of using only one active ingredient. To this day we apply this approach in every one of our amazing remedies. In our FDA-inspected facility in Albuquerque, NM, we develop homeopathic remedies that are made using rigorous pharmaceutical Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) which ensure potency and purity.
