Activities 33 For the Teacher During the fourteenth century, sailors and traders on the Mediterranean Sea learned a variety of Italian, Turkish, French, Spanish, Greek, and Arabic phrases so they could communicate with one another. Eventually an international language of trade developed, known as lingua franca, borrow- ing words and sounds from each people. The term lingua franca has come to mean any language used by a group of people whose rst languages are dif- ferent. T oday scientists from around the world communicate in English, and English has therefore become the lingua franca of science. The English lexicon (the entire stock of words belonging to the language) is much greater than any other due in part to the scienti c words that are added daily. The English scienti c vocabulary is increasingly rich and complex, allowing scientists and others to express themselves more precisely than ever before. Unfortunately the growing vocabulary of scienti c English makes it increasingly dif cult for students to master, particularly for those who learn it as a second language. This chapter presents resources and activities to make this task easier. Scientists give names to new discoveries, concepts, theories, and inventions using classi-cal Latin and Greek roots, pre xes, and suf xes. Since these languages are no longer spoken (they were replaced by modern Italian and Greek), the meanings of words never change. For exam-ple, the ancient Greeks used the word therme to describe heat, and today we use the root therm to mean \" heat \" in a variety of English words, such thermocline. A simple science root word can provide clues to numerous other words, greatly reducing the amount of memorization necessary to master this new vocabulary and making it easier for people speaking different rst languages to understand. A knowledge of Greek and Latin root words can greatly enhance student understanding of c01.indd 3 3 5/9/08 4:54:17 PM 5/9/08 4:54:17 PM4 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science I suggest that teachers provide their students with copies of the relevant root word lists that fol-low in this chapter to keep in the back of their note-books alongside the glossaries that they develop. Each time a new term is introduced in class, stu-dents should analyze its pre xes, suf xes, and roots and add the entry to their personal glossaries as described in the activities that follow. 1.1 Biology Vocabulary Biology has a larger vocabulary than any other branch of science, but fortunately nearly all bio-logical terms contain roots, pre xes, and suf xes with predictable meanings, many of which appear in Table 1.1 . Knowing these roots greatly simpli es the acquisition of new terms, and the following activities will help in memorizing and understand- ing these roots. scienti c terms and provide a better understanding of English and other European languages. Approx-imately 50 percent of all words in English have Latin roots, many of them shared by Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Italian words. Learning scienti c root words thereby helps us understand the vocabulary of a variety of languages, particu-larly English. The activities in this chapter focus on scienti c terms, but the roots are used in other words as well. For example, the pre x anti - means \" against \" or \" opposite \" as in the following scien-ti c terms: antiseptic, same pre x is used in many nonscienti c terms as well, such as anticlimac- tic, antifreeze, antiperspirant, antidepressant, and antiterrorism. Thus, an understanding of the roots introduced in this chapter helps us all master both scienti c and nonscienti c terms and become more pro cient in the use of language.

Many stu-dents memorize the names of the elements but do not realize that these names are descriptive. For example, helium derives its name from the Greek word helios, meaning \" sun, \" because the rst evi- dence of its existence was obtained by analyzing the spectrum of sunlight. The word hydrogen comes from the Greek words hydro, meaning \" water \" (as in hydroelectric and hydrolysis ) and gen, mean- ing \" beginning \" (as in Genesis, gene, and genetics ). Thus, the word hydrogen means \" water former, \" an appropriate name for a substance that forms water when it combusts. Examine Table 1.4 , and note that every element has a meaningful name. ACTIVITY 1.2.1 Understanding Chemistry Root Words Table 1.5 lists the most common roots, pre- xes, and suf xes used in chemistry. Following each de nition is a series of chemical terms that share this root.

According to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a scienti cally literate person is one who is aware that science, mathematics, and technology are interdependent human enter-prises with strengths and limitations; under-stands key concepts and principles of science; is familiar with the natural world and recognizes both its diversity and unity; and uses scienti c knowledge and scienti c ways of thinking for individual and social purposes. 1 The National Academy of Science states: Scienti c literacy means that a person can ask, nd, or determine answers to questions derived from curiosity about everyday experiences. It means that a person has the ability to describe, explain, and predict natural phenomena. Scienti c literacy entails being able to read with understanding articles about science in the pop-ular press and to engage in social conversation about the validity of the conclusions. Scienti c literacy implies that a person can identify scien-ti c issues underlying national and local deci- sions and express positions that are scienti cally and technologically informed. A literate citizen should be able to evaluate the quality of scien-ti c information on the basis of its source and the methods used to generate it. Scienti c liter- acy also implies the capacity to pose and evaluate arguments based on evidence and to apply con-clusions from such arguments appropriately. 2 Finally the Programme for International Stu- dent Assessment de nes scienti c literacy: As the capacity to use scienti c knowledge, to identify questions and to draw evidence - based conclusions in order to understand and help c02.indd 35 c02.indd 35 5/9/08 5:53:38 Sourcebook for Teaching Science Decoding is the transformation of an encoded message into a usable form; reading requires com prehension. Therefore, if students have poor compre hension, they are poor readers even if they can decode fl uently. Fortunately, there are tech- niques to help poor readers become good read-ers. Table 2.1 contrasts the habits of poor readers with strategic readers. It is important for teachers to recognize these characteristics so they can diag-nose reading problems and help students improve. Techniques for Improving Reading This book introduces a variety of strategies for improving science literacy by improving science make decisions about the natural world and the changes made to it through human activity. 3 A scienti cally literate person is able to read and write about scienti c topics. The person who speaks English has a distinct advantage in this regard, since more scienti c research is published in English than any other language. English - language literacy strategies promote scienti c literacy by pro- viding the tools necessary to read scienti c material. In this chapter, we introduce strategies that are use-ful for English learners as well as native speakers. Developing Strategic Readers Many students believe that they are good readers, when in fact they are simply good decoders. Table 2.1 Characteristics of Poor and Strategic Readers Poor readers . . . Strategic readers . . .Before readingFocus Do not eliminate distractions Establish an environment free of distractions Background Start reading without thinking about contentReview background information before reading Structure Do not review the structure established by the authorReview structure, author notes, headings, and formatted terms Goals Do not have speci c goals for what they hope to accomplishSet speci c goals before they start readingWhile readingNotes Do not take notes List the key points and summarize major ideas Vocabulary Ignore words they do not understandUse roots, semantic, and syntactic clues to determine meanings Re-reading Continue \"reading\" even if they do not understand key pointsRe-read confusing sections Synthesis Do not relate new information with prior knowledgeIntegrate new material with prior understanding Refl ection Do not refl ect on what they have readGenerate questions from the reading Highlights Highlight and underline too much or not at allHighlight or underline only key points Assessment Do not assess understanding, or only at the end of the passageAssess understanding by outlining and solving problemsAfter readingEvaluation Do not have any goals to evaluate Determine if they have reached their goals Paraphrase Memorize material verbatim or not at all.Express key points in their own words Discussion Do not \"self-talk\" or discuss the material with othersConduct \"self-talk\" and discuss concepts with others Review Do not review the material they have readIntegrate new information with prior knowledge c02.indd 36 c02.indd 36 5/9/08 5:53:39 PM 5/9/08 5:53:39 PMDeveloping Science Reading Skills 37 reading comprehension. Many of these strategies are found in other chapters. Following is a sum-mary of these techniques (the number in parenthe-ses is the section number where the full discussion may be found): Cornell notes (3.1): Cornell notes are commonly used in lectures, but can also be helpful for understanding and remembering the struc-ture and content of written material. Students must take notes (brief phrases, words, and dia-grams) and identify cues (key words or ques-tions) from the reading. They then cover their notes and use the cues to quiz themselves and see what they have remembered. Eventually they summarize the key points. Advanced organizers (8.1): Students preread the science text to understand its structure and the scope of its content. By consciously ana-lyzing and recording the author ' s outline and advance organizers, they are better prepared to understand the text when they read it. Mind (semantic) maps (9.4): Mind mapping is a brainstorming technique in which a radial \" map \" is developed showing the relationship of a central idea to supporting facts and con-cepts. Mind maps can be used to review and discuss the central theme of a chapter. Concept maps (9.5): Students can develop a con- cept map for the theme of a chapter or section. This technique requires a good understanding of the material and can be used as a postread-ing activity to develop comprehension. KWL (8.0): Students discuss what they K now and what they W ant to know prior to read- ing and what they have L earned after reading a passage. This approach is used to develop read-ing goals so students can read with a purpose. SQ3R (8.0): SQ3R is the acronym for a technique known as S urvey, Q uestion, R ead, R ecite, R eview. SQ3R is a structured approach that focuses on comprehension. Root words (1.1 - 1.4): Students learn how to construct and decipher scienti c words by understanding the meanings of roots, pre xes, and suf xes common to biology, chemistry, physics, and the earth and space sciences. Cloze (2.1): Cloze activities (providing closure to passages with missing words) are used to assess the readability of a passage. The higher the cloze scores for a given population, the more readable the passage is. In this chapter, we introduce cloze as a technique for develop-ing and assessing reading comprehension. Jigsaw (2.2): Jigsaw is a technique whereby stu- dents develop reading skills by consulting with others, preparing notes, and teaching their peers. Cognates (2.3 - 4): Cognates are words in differ- ent languages that have the same linguistic roots. Once students recognize the similarities between English and their native language, they will be better prepared to gure out the meanings of unfamiliar words. Choosing Textbooks for English Learners Students learn English and science fastest if their science textbooks are well structured, match the curriculum, and include well - documented charts, diagrams, and pictures. T eachers should review the following features before adopting a science textbook for English learners: Organization: Is the text clearly organized with appropriate chapters, headings, and subheadings? Guide questions: Does the text have questions that guide the reading? Terms and principles: Are key terms and princi- ples highlighted using special formatting? Diagrams: Is the text with clear, Are these diagrams anno-tated and labeled? Illustrations: key ideas illustrated with informative diagrams, charts, or pictures? Sentence structure: Are sentences clear, concise, and instructive? Summaries: Does the text include section sum- maries and key points to remember? Glossary: Does the text include a comprehensive glossary showing the relationship between roots and science terms? Teaching Science 2.1 Science Reading Comprehension: Cloze Look at Figures 2.1 A, 2.1 B, and 2.1 C, and record the shapes you see. Most people see a square in Figure 2.1 A, a circle in Figure 2.1 B, and a trian-gle in Figure 2.1 C, but if you look again, you will note that none of these shapes is actually found in the diagram. Y our mind sees clues and provides \" closure \" to the partial patterns it detects. Similarly, your mind provides closure if you don ' t decode every word when you are reading. Reading specialists believe that your ability to provide closure is a measure of reading compre-hension and have developed the cloze activity to assess and develop this skill. A passage of two hun-dred to three hundred words in length is selected. The rst and last sentences are kept intact, and every fth word of the remaining text is replaced by a blank. The blanks are of equal length so as not to give the reader clues other than the context. Students work individually or in groups to infer or predict words that provide meaning. Readers use syntax, context, and prior knowledge to predict the hidden words. ACTIVITY 2.1.1 Develop a Science Cloze Worksheet Create a science cloze worksheet for another stu-dent by doing the following: 1. Select a 200 - to 300 - word passage from your science textbook, science magazine, or related resource. 2. Transcribe the rst sentence intact. 3. Transcribe all but the last sentence, replacing every fth word with a blank of equal length, as illustrated in Exhibit 2.1 . 4. Transcribe the last sentence intact. 5.

Involve me, and I ' ll understand. \" One of the most effective ways to be involved in the learning process is to share your understanding with another. In the process of explaining to others, you develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding. In this activ-ity, students study a science passage and explain it to their peers. Each student is assigned to a home group (groups 1 - 4, Figure 2.2 A) and an expert group (groups A - D, Figure 2.2 B). The text from a chapter or other read-ing is divided into as many sections as there are expert groups. Students go to their \" expert group \" to study their portion of the chapter. In the exam-ple (Figure 2.2 ), the chapter on fundamental forces is divided such that group A studies gravity, group B studies electromagnetism, group C studies strong nuclear force, and group D studies weak nuclear force. In expert groups, students read the perti-nent portion of the chapter and prepare to teach by developing a summary, list of key terms, diagrams, and ques tions. They consult with each other, share explanations, and prepare to teach. The \" experts \" return to their home groups and teach their peers using the materials prepared in the expert group. In the example (Figure 2.2 ) the A ' s teach about gravity, the B ' s electromagnet-ism, the C ' s strong nuclear force, and the D ' s weak nuclear force. The content will vary depending on the material the teacher selects. ACTIVITY 2.2.1 Peer Teaching with the Jigsaw Technique Divide into expert groups as directed by the teacher. Dialogue with the other experts and pre-pare a summary, list of key terms, set of diagrams, and questions for the passage designated that the teacher has designated. Return to your home group, and teach your colleagues using the mate-rial you have prepared. 2.3 Science Vocabulary in Spanish and English Spanish (Espa \u00f1 ol) is one of the most infl uential languages in the world, particularly in the Western Hemisphere, where it is the dominant language in Central and South America. Spanish is also preva-lent in the United States, where it is the rst lan- guage of many immigrants. Spanish is a Latin - based language and shares much in common with other Romance languages, such as Italian, French, and A1 B1 1 home group 2 home group 4 home group 3 A1 A2 A3A4D1 D2 D3D4 B1 B2 B3B4C1 C2 C3C4expert group D expert group C expert group A expert group B Sample assignment go to expert group to study return to home groups to teach peersABTopics for groups A - gravity B - electromagnetismC - strong nuclearD - weak nuclear Figure 2.2 Jigsaw Strategy c02.indd 39 39 5/9/08 5:53:41 PM 5/9/08 5:53:41 PM40 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Portuguese. It also shares much in common with English, particularly in science, where many words in both languages are based on Latin roots. As a result, an English - speaking scientist with no formal training in Spanish can recognize many scienti c words in Spanish, and a Spanish - speaking scientist with no formal training in English can recognize many scienti c words in English. Words that have similar linguistic roots are known as cognates. A list of a few English/Spanish science cognates appears in Table 2.2 .

Table 2.5 shows the similarity of some common scienti c terms among ve major Western European languages. Pronounce each term as best you can, and note that words in different languages sound similar even if they have different spellings. There are also many similarities between English scienti c words and scienti c words in languages not native to Western Europe. These similarities arise when both languages rely on Latin and Greek roots to coin new terms or when English words are imported, as shown by the wide- spread adoption of the word ecology (Table 2.6 ).

Scientists share their hypotheses, ndings, and criticisms through writing. Upon completion of their research, they write manuscripts describing their hypotheses, methods, materials, results, and conclusions. These manuscripts are examined by other scientists, who write reviews to determine if the research is wor-thy of publication. This process of peer review is central to the scienti c endeavor. In 1989, two chemists, Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischman, broke this convention when they made a startling announcement of their achievement of \" cold fusion \" to the media with-out rst committing their work to writing and submitting it for peer review. 1 These scientists claimed to have achieved nuclear fusion (the proc-ess that releases energy in the Sun and other stars) at room temperature, an achievement that offered the promise of a limitless supply of energy for the world. While Pons and Fleischman were enjoying worldwide attention, their colleagues were express- ing outrage that media announcements had been made prior to peer review of the work. Since the work had never been submitted for peer review or published in a reputable journal, other scien-tists were unable to assess its validity. For years, other chemists continued to work on the problem but were unable to replicate the results. Pons and Fleischman were widely discredited in the scien-ti c community not because of their experiments, but because they had announced their ndings to the media without rst committing them to writ- ing and submitting them for peer review. The cold fusion scandal underscores the importance of writing to the scienti c endeavor. Writing is an essential element of many profes- sions and is fundamental to business and commu-nication. Ernest Boyer, one of the most infl uential spokesmen of higher education, said that \" perhaps more than any other form of communication, writ-ing holds us responsible for our words and ulti-mately makes us more thoughtful human beings. \" 2 c03.indd 45 c03.indd 45 5/9/08 12:36:19 PM 5/9/08 12:36:19 PM46 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science different from dictation. The verbatim copying of notes from a screen or board or the verbatim copy-ing of a teacher ' s spoken words reduces the time and energy for understanding and integrating the infor-mation presented. Many students think that it is unnecessary to take notes if they can understand what their instructor is saying. This misconception arises when students view note taking as a form of dictation rather than an integral portion of the learning process. When stu-dents take notes correctly, they are actively engaged in the lecture and remember concepts and ideas better, even if they never review the notes. The very process of distilling the thoughts of the lecturer is helpful in comprehending and remembering the material. Here are some rules for effective note taking. Rules for Effective Note Taking Review: Review previous notes before the lecture begins. This provides context and allows you to connect new ideas and information with previously learned material. Think! Notes should include your thoughts as you process the lecture. Y ou must be actively engaged, thinking about the content while you are taking notes. Key concepts: As you listen to and see infor- mation presented in lecture, identify and record key concepts, and skip less meaning-ful details and information. Filter what the teacher says, and take notes on ideas that will prompt your memory. Notes, not dictation: Do not write in full sen- tences as this requires too much time and may cause you to miss important points. Substitute phrases for sentences and words for phrases whenever possible. Use your own words: Whenever possible, put ideas in your own words rather than quoting the teacher. This requires comprehension and will help you remember material longer. Format: Use an informal but uniform format. Underline main concepts and indent subcon-cepts. Leave space for later additions. Organization: Number your pages, and keep the notes in order. Using a bound notebook helps maintain the pages in sequential order. Unfortunately a large percentage of students never gain this bene t because they do not write very often or very much. No one becomes a profes-sional athlete without extensive practice, and no one becomes an excellent writer without extensive practice. Just as coaches schedule workouts for their athletes, teachers should schedule writing oppor-tunities for their students. The activities in this chapter are \" workouts \" designed to help students become better writers of science. Scienti c writing offers special challenges for English learners. English learners may simultane-ously be learning to use conversational English in their language acquisition courses, write creative essays in English, review opinion papers in govern-ment, write slang in instant messages, and draft lab reports in science. Learning to write in many forms is challenging for native speakers and can be over-whelming for English learners, particularly if they are unfamiliar with such forms of writing in their native languages. It is therefore important that teachers model scienti c writing and provide exam- ples to their students, showing how it differs from other literary forms. Scienti c writing is precise, economical, and formal, and it is helpful to read good examples of scienti c writing aloud to illus- trate these principles to your students. Encourage all of your students to read their own writing aloud, since hearing the text is one of best ways to see if it fl ows and makes sense. It may also be helpful for students to use the speech synthesis feature of their computer to listen to their written work. 3.1 Science Note Taking Lectures are a hallmark of secondary and higher education. Unlike video recordings, lectures are live performances, requiring mental and physical partic-ipation on the part of students. Many students think that the primary use of note taking is to capture the teacher ' s ideas so they can be studied after class. Although this is a value of note taking, it is minor in comparison with the potential learning that can take place during active engagement in thought-ful, refl ective note taking. True note taking requires discernment, ltering, and processing and is quite 5/9/08 12:36:20 Writing Skills 47 Rework: Rework your notes shortly after completing them. Add points, diagrams, and other reminders, but do not rewrite them as this detracts from time that is better spent in other activities. Review: Review your notes shortly after com- pleting them and prior to the next lecture or assessment. One of the most popular and effective note - taking methods is the Cornell notes system. This system was developed at Cornell University to help students learn more effectively from lectures and readings, and it is now widely used in secondary schools as well. T o begin, divide a piece of paper into three sections as illustrated in Figure 3.1 . The largest section is devoted to notes; the side column is reserved for cues, key words, and concepts; and the bottom row is allocated for a summary. ACTIVITY 3.1.1 Note Taking with the Cornell Notes System: Lecture Take Cornell notes of your class lecture or dis-cussion for a day, week, or other period de ned by your instructor. Follow these guidelines when using Cornell notes: Notes : Write your raw notes in the \" notes \" col- umn using brief phrases, words, and diagrams. Cues : Shortly after class, write a list of key words and questions in the \" cue \" column. Recite : Cover the notes, and using the cue words to trigger your memory, try to deliver the key points of the lecture to yourself or another student. Summary : Summarize the key points in the sum- mary section. ACTIVITY 3.1.2 Note Taking with the Cornell Notes System: Reading Cornell notes are useful for organizing the con-cepts in a section or chapter of a book or maga-zine. Following the directions listed for Activity 3.1.1, write Cornell notes for a chapter or other portion of your text. 3.2 Science Journaling Publilius Syrus, a rst century b.c. author, wrote, \" Practice is the best of all instructors. \" Syrus knew that only those who practice can become excellent writers. More recently it has been said that the secret of becoming a writer is to write, write, and keep on writing. Athletes do not become good at their sport with an occasional game, but through regular practice and competition. Similarly, people do not become good writers by writing occasional brief notes, but only through regular informal and formal writing. Unfortunately many students never develop good writing skills because they fail to write enough. Many get so bogged down with the mechanics of writing (style, spelling, punctuation, form, and syn- tax) that they never get enough writing practice to improve. A popular technique to give students ample writing practice is known as journaling. Journaling is a widely used technique in which individuals keep a daily written record of their Figure 3.1 Cornell Note-Taking System: Sample from a Lecture on Photosynthesis 5/9/08 12:36:20 PM 5/9/08 12:36:20 PM48 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science thoughts and activities. Writing gives them the opportunity to clarify their thoughts, opinions, and plans. In the science classroom, journaling can be used to provide students with writing prac-tice while they refl ect on relevant topics. Students record their thoughts in a bound notebook and share their writings periodically with their teacher. The process of translating an idea into writing helps students process and clarify ideas. The idea eventually takes shape for a learner when he or she must discuss a concept in writing. Journals are typically evaluated on the basis of the quality and quantity of thoughts expressed, not on the quality of the syntax, spelling, and form. Journals should be kept in a bound note-book (Figure 3.2 ) with the date written at the top of each page. It is important to have regular entries, so assignments should be kept short and distinctly different from traditional worksheets or homework. Following is a list of journaling topics for the science classroom: Current events (seeing the connection between science, technology, and society). Summarize an article about a relevant scienti c discovery. The summary should contain the title, date, author, and source, and a one - paragraph summary of the article writ-ten in your own words. There are numerous sources of current events in science, including the science sections of many newspapers. These can generally be accessed online ( sciencesourcebook.com or search \" New Y ork Times science \" ). Observations (building observational skills). Record as many observations as possible about an object or process selected by the teacher. Be certain to record only observations, and not inferences that you have made (see section 5.3). Suitable observa-tions include teacher demonstrations or experi-ments, samples of items from the natural world (rocks, fossils, plants, insects), chemical reactions (for example, Faraday ' s burning candle activity in section 5.2.1), photographs (plant communities, machines, animals), and video clips (athletic feats, natural proc-esses, technological innovations). Observations can include color, shape, odor, texture, structure, compo-sition, organization, moveme nt, direction, location, temperature, magnetism, and pressure. Longitudinal studies (recording observations over time). Scienti c observations and experi- ments often take place over numerous days (these are called longitudinal studies ) and require careful note taking. Record your observations and meas-urements of a long - term process on a regular basis of such things as bacterial growth on an agar plate, the germination of a seed, the growth response of a plant with respect to gravity or light, the decompo-sition of plant material in a plastic bottle decom-position chamber, or the growth of crystals in an evaporating dish. Prior knowledge (refl ecting on what you already know). Write down everything you know about a particular topic before it is introduced in class. For example, if the topic is electricity, write down all know about electricity: how it is pro-duced, what it is used for, how it is delivered to your home, how it is stored, how it is purchased, who produces it, and so forth. This can be done for virtually any topic in science. Misconceptions (using critical reasoning). There are many common misconceptions in science that may serve as prompts for journal entries. For exam-ple, many people think that the reason temperatures are higher in the summer is that the Earth is closer to the Sun at this time. T o explore this misconcep-tion, a journal prompt could ask, \" If it is true that seasons are a function of our distance from the Sun, then why is it winter in the Southern Hemisphere Figure 3.2 Notebook for Science Journaling c03.indd 48 c03.indd 48 5/9/08 12:36:22 PM 5/9/08 12:36:22 PMDeveloping Science Writing Skills 49 when it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere? Provide a reasonable explanation for seasonality. \" Students will gain experience writing as they wres-tle with such misconceptions. See sections 7.4 to 7.7 for a series of misconceptions that may be used as journal prompts. ACTIVITY 3.2.1 Journaling in Science Maintain a bound journal (Figure 3.2 ) for your science class. Record entries for all prompts (cur-rent events, observations, longitudinal studies, prior knowledge, misconceptions, and so forth) provided by your teacher. For each journal entry, include the date, the prompt, and your answer or response to the prompt. 3.3 Science Essay Questions Educators use essays to assess analytical skills, written expression, and content mastery. Essays are a common element of standardized assessments such as the Scholastic Aptitude and Advanced Placement tests. Unfortunately many students do poorly on such assessments because they do not accurately analyze the essay questions before start-ing to write. Consequently they may write lengthy essays that are interesting, but off - topic, so they receive little or no credit for their efforts. In my own experience as a consultant for national testing agencies, I have noted common problems that arise when students do not ade-quately analyze essay questions. These problems are illustrated in response to two past Advanced Placement Biology Exam questions: Sample Question Discuss the processes of exchange of O 2 and CO 2 that occur at the alveoli and muscle cells of mammals. Include in your answer a description of the transport of these gases in the blood. Problems Hasty assumptions: A large percentage of stu- dents wrote lengthy essays on the respiratory system and included diagrams of the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, lungs, and diaphragm. They immediately saw the formulas for oxy-gen and carbon dioxide and assumed the question dealt with the respiratory system. Being familiar with the mechanics of respira-tion, they proceeded to write lengthy off - topic essays. Not only did such students receive no points for their efforts, but this diversion took away valuable writing time. Incomplete responses: Many students wrote good essays about one component of the question but forgot to address the other components. For example, some focused entirely on oxygen, alveoli, or processes of exchange and failed to discuss carbon dioxide, muscle cells, or trans-port in the blood. Their incomplete responses cost them points on the test. Sample Question Discuss the processes of cleavage, gastrula-tion, and neurulation in the frog embryo. T ell what each process accomplishes. Describe an experiment that illustrates the importance of induction in development. Problems Inability to generalize: Many students wrote comments such as, \" We only studied chicken embryology, so I know nothing about frogs! \" Such students panicked when they saw \" frog embryo, \" not realizing that vertebrates have similar embryological development and that the question could have been answered ade-quately using knowledge from the embryology of other vertebrates such as the chicken. Poor time allocation: \" Primacy \" and \" recency \" effects cause us to remember the beginning and ends of questions more than the material in the middle. In this instance, some students spent the majority of their time focusing on the induction experiment (the most recent item in the question), even though it was only a fourth of the question and points. Disorganized responses: Many students never organized their thoughts before writing, and as a result, their answers were rambling c03.indd 49 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science and incoherent. This and the other problems can be avoided by developing a framework or conceptual grid as shown in the next section. Preparing a Response If you do not check your map before driving to a new location, you will probably waste a lot of time and gasoline and may never arrive at your desti-nation. Similarly, if you do not analyze the \" road map \" inherent in an essay question before you start to write, you will likely waste a lot of time and energy and may never meet the requirements. T o ensure an accurate \" road map \" when writing essay, do the following before writing: Read the question twice. Highlight and categorize key terms. Develop a grid (Exhibit 3.1 ) or outline of the question. Write notes of items to discuss in each section. These steps are illustrated in the following examples. In question 1, we have put boxes around the two major topics of exchange and transport, double underlined the two gases in question, and underlined the regions where we must discuss exchange and transport. This can be expressed as a matrix or table, as shown in Exhibit 3.1 . The table indicates that a complete response to the question should address six speci c issues, indicated by the six boxes in the table. For question 2 we have boxed the major issues (processes, accomplishments, and experi-mentation) and underlined the categories to which these apply (cleavage, gastrulation, neurulation, and the importance of induction), then charted the question as shown in Exhibit 3.2 . Once the speci cs have been lled in, one can proceed to write the essay. ACTIVITY 3.3.1 Preparing an Outline or Grid for an Essay Question Highlight the key terms in the following essay questions and create grids or frameworks simi-lar to those shown in Exhibit 3.1 . It is not necessary to have an understanding of the topics because the questions provide suf cient infor- mation to develop an outline or grid. Y ou do not need to ll in the cells with notes unless you have recently studied these topics. 1. Discuss how the rate of photosynthesis var- ies in C3, C4, and CAM plants with respect to temperature, wavelength, and light intensity. 2. Compare the inner planets with the outer planets with respect to composition, size, and orbital velocity.

Compare and contrast the nutritional require- ments and means of acquiring nutrition of angiosperms (fl owering plants) and verte- brates. 4. Explain how energy transfer occurs and how ATP is involved in cellular movement, fermen-tation, chemiosmosis, and active transport. ACTIVITY 3.3.2 Completing an Outline or Grid for an essay question Develop an outline or grid for essay questions pro-vided by your teacher. Fill in the cells from your knowledge of the topic as illustrated in Exhibit 3.2 . 3.4 Types of Science Writing There are many types of literary genre, includ- ing poetry, novels, history, ballads, plays, and short stories, each with its own rules and nuances. Similarly, there are a variety of scienti c gen- res, including lab report, open essay, directed essay, library research review, and scienti c jour- nal report, each with its own distinctive rules and nuances. This section includes activities for writing a variety of scienti c genre. All work that is not your own should be cited. The MLA (Modern Language Association), ACS (American Chemical Society), Chicago (University of Chicago), APA (American Psychological Society), and CBE (Council of Biology Editors) style manuals are commonly used, and you should check with your teacher regarding the preferred format at your school. Table 3.1 illustrates sample citations based on the APA Style Manual. ACTIVITY 3.4.1 Writing a Science Lab Report The laboratory report derives its structure from the scienti c method and is similar in structure to research papers found in scienti c journals. The lab report is used to document laboratory work done in class. Write your laboratory reports using the following structure: Problem: Statement of the question or problem to be researched Background: Description of what is already known Exhibit 3.2 Grid and Notes for Answering an Essay Question (2) Discuss the processes of cleavage, gastrulation, and neurulation in the frog embryo; tell what each process accomplishes .

In such situations, it is recommended that students adopt the classic essay structure: introduction, body, and conclu-sion. Write your open essays using the following structure: Introduction: The introduction is the rst para- graph of an essay and presents a clear state-ment of the intent of the essay and a brief summary of what will follow in the body. Body: The body presents concrete evidence to support the ideas expressed in the introduc-tion. It is supported by speci c examples and references to ndings in the literature or labo- ratory. Each paragraph has a topic statement, summarizing the key points addressed. Conclusion: The conclusion summarizes and interprets the essay. ACTIVITY 3.4.3 Writing a Directed Essay Directed essays have speci c prompts that dictate the structure of the essay. Students should develop a conceptual outline or grid (see section 3.3) that refl ects the issues that must be addressed and write the essay accordingly. Write your directed essays using the following guidelines: Response to prompt: Examine the essay prompt and identify each major question and all sub-questions (see section 3.3). The essay should answer these in a logical manner, which is Table 3.1 Citing References Using APA Style Citations as They Appear in the Bibliography or Reference Section Citations as They Appear in the Text Books Herr, N., & Cunningham, J.

Directed essays require speci c mate- rial, and it is therefore generally not necessary to provide an introduction and conclusion, but ask your teacher for clari c a t i o n . ACTIVITY 3.4.4 Writing a Library Research Paper A library research paper summarizes the ndings of other researchers. It does not include new infor-mation, although it may be assembled in a novel or concise manner. It is often given as a special assignment or extra - credit project. Write your library research papers using the following structure: Introduction: The introduction is one or more paragraphs that include a clear statement of the research topic and any speci c questions addressed. Body: The body elaborates on the issues dis- cussed in the introduction. All references are according to the style you are using. Summary: The summary reviews major ndings and raises questions for future research. References: Many science journals use the name - year system for citing references (Table 3.1 ). ACTIVITY 3.4.5 Writing a Scienti c Journal Paper Scienti c research published in journals usually has the following format, which you should follow in writing your scienti c journal papers: Title: The title concisely describes the contents of the paper. Authors and af liations: The primary investiga- tor ' s name is rst, followed by the names of the other researchers. Each author ' s name is followed by his or her institution. Abstract: The abstract summarizes the paper in 300 words or less. It includes a brief statement of the question, experimental design and meth-ods, major ndings including key quantitative results or trends, and a brief summary of the researcher ' s interpretations and conclusions. Introduction: The introduction establishes the context of the research by discussing pri-mary research (with citations); summarizing current understanding of the issues; stating the purposes of the research in the form of a hypothesis, question, or problem to be inves-tigated; and explaining the rationale for the research. Methods: The methods section explains how the research was conducted, including details on subjects (plants, animals, rocks), study site (global positioning system coordinates, slope, aspect), and experimental or sampling design (controls, treatments, independent variable, dependent variables, replications, and proce-dures for collecting data). Results: The results section presents the data in an orderly and logical sequence, using tables, charts, gures, and graphs as appropriate. Summaries, highlights, and negative results are included. Discussion: The discussion interprets the hypoth- esis or problem statement in the light of the data and shows how the study has helped move our understanding forward. References: All references are cited using one of the accepted formats (see above). 3.5 Science Writing Style Each type of literary genre has its own style con- ventions. For example, the repetition of a line may be appropriate in the lyrics of a poem or song but inappropriate when writing a book on English grammar. Science has its own writing style con-ventions that differ from those in other disciplines, but many students don ' t understand these con-ventions because they learned to write in English classes, not in science classes. The following are characteristics of scienti c writing. Scienti c Writing Is Logical Start each paragraph with a topic sentence. Subsequent sentences in each paragraph should relate to the topic sentence. Do not use unlinked ideas in the same paragraph. c03.indd 53 c03.indd 53 5/9/08 12:36:26 PM 5/9/08 12:36:26 PM54 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Do not change the direction of an argument more than once in a paragraph. For example, do not use the word however more than once per paragraph. Organize your writing into appropriate sec-tions and subsections. Explain abbreviations and acronyms in paren-theses the rst time they are used \u2014 for exam- ple, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) or BMI (body mass index). Focus your thoughts by writing the summary rst. Make certain that the body of text is con- sistent with the summary. Format your document to show its logical structure: Put headings in BOLD UPPER CASE . Put subheadings in Bold Title Case . Use italics for emphasis and bold for strong emphasis. Scienti c Writing Is Economical Scientists write economically. They avoid redun- dancy and use as few words as necessary to com-municate. The following list has examples of phrases that may be expressed more economically by deleting unnecessary or redundant words as shown. a total of n samples four different groups absolutely essential in close proximity also included in order to except for period of time for the purpose of summarize briefl y found previously the reason is because Scienti c Writing Is Precise Scientists write with precision, choosing words that communicate as accurately as possible. Scientists avoid unwarranted generalizations by using speci c terminology. Examine Table 3.2 . Although the terms in the left column may be accurate, they are not precise. By contrast, the terms in the right column are precise and there-fore more appropriate in most scienti c writing. Scienti c Writing Is Standardized Scienti c writing is standardized. There is a standard way of representing units ( mks ), unit symbols, unit names, and numbers. Standardization makes it easy to compare information from a variety of sources. The standards accepted by most scientists follow. Standard Units Le Syst \u00e9 me International des Unit \u00e9 s (SI) is an internationally recognized system of measurement adopted in 1960 by the General Conference of Weights and Measures. Scientists are encouraged to express all measurements in SI units so colleagues around the world can interpret them readily. There are seven fundamental units from which all other units can be derived: Quantity Unit Symbol distance meter m mass kilogram kg time second s temperature kelvin K amount mole mol charge coulomb C luminous intensity candela cd The far - right column in Table 3.3 shows how mks units are expressed in terms of these seven units.

Electrical current is the amount of electrical charge (measured in coulombs) per unit of time. Standardized Number Formatting For numbers less than 1, a zero precedes the decimal point: 0.0453, not .0453. A tilde (~) is used to indicate \" approximately equal \" : ~57 kg. A space is placed between numbers and units: 82 m, not 82m. The number of signi cant gures includes all of the certain digits plus the rst uncertain digit. Numbers beginning sentences should be spelled out. Rewrite sentences so that large numbers are not at the beginning of sentences. Standardized Unit Names When written in full, units begin with a lowercase letter: Correct: kelvin, 12:36:27 PM56 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Standardized Unit Symbols The rst letter in a unit symbol is uppercase when the unit name is derived from a person ' s name. The following list shows units that are named after scientists. Note that the unit name is not capitalized, but the unit symbol is. ampere A Andr \u00e9 Amp \u00e8 re discovered basic principles of electrodynamics. coulomb C Charles Coulomb discovered the law of force between charged bodies. farad F Michael Faraday pioneered research in electricity and magnetism. henry H Joseph Henry discovered electromagnetic induction and self - induction. hertz Hz Heinrich Hertz discovered radio waves. joule J James Joule pioneered research in thermodynamics. kelvin K William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) developed the absolute temperature scale. newton N Isaac Newton pioneered work in forces, calculus, optics, and gravitation. ohm /H9024 Georg Ohm discovered the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance. p ascal Pa Blaise Pascal discovered basic principles of hydrostatics. tesla T Nikola Tesla developed the AC motor and high - voltage transformers. volt V Allesandro Volta invented the rst battery. watt W James Watt developed the steam engine as a practical power source. weber Wb Wilhelm Weber performed early research in electricity and magnetism. The following units are not named after people, and therefore their symbols are not capi-talized: meter, m; degree, . Unit Pre xes The symbols for all pre xes representing factors less than 1 million are never capitalized (y, z, a, f, p, n, k , m, c, d, da, h, k). The symbols representing factors equal to or greater than 1 million are always capitalized (M, G, T, P , X, Z, Y).

The following are examples of common compound units: volt /H11005 kg\u00b7 Quantity Symbols Versus Unit Symbols By convention, quantity symbols are italicized, and unit symbols are not. Quantity symbols represent a physical quantity such as time, mass, and length; unit symbols represent speci c measures of those quantities, such as seconds, kilograms, and meters. c03.indd 56 c03.indd 56 5/9/08 12:36:28 PM 5/9/08 12:36:28 PMDeveloping Science Writing Skills 57 Quantity Symbols Unit Symbols time, t seconds, s mass, m kilograms, kg length, l meter, m heat, Q joule, J ACTIVITY 3.5.1 Principles of Style Review the principles of style for scienti c writing, and identify the best expression from each pair: 1 it is suggested that a relationship may exist a relationship may exist 2 because based on the fact that 3 the reason is because because 4 very strong storm category 4 hurricane 5 low pressure 950 mb 6 83% of all those tested many 7 the same one and the same 8 0.0567 .0567 9 temperature of 273 K temperature of 273 k 10 length (l) and mass (m) . . . length . . . 11 length of 5 m and mass of 10 kg length of 5 m and mass of 10 kg 12 how many newtons of force? how many Newtons of force? 13 current of 25 a (amperes) current of 25 A (amperes) 14 pressure of 1000 Pa (pascals) pressure of 1000 pa (Pascals) 15 15 kg \u00b7 m/s 2 15 Kgm/s 2 16 1 calorie of energy 4.1868 joules of energy 17 1 pascal of pressure 10 bayre of pressure 18 1 kilometer 0.621 miles 19 32 Fahrenheit 273 Kelvin 20 44.7 meters/second 100 miles per hour Answers to Chapter Activities 3.1.1 Students will develop Cornell notes such as shown in Figure 3.1 . 3.1.2 Students will develop Cornell notes such as shown in Figure 3.1 . 3.2.1 Students will maintain a science journal as speci- ed.

Kinematics, bonding, DNA, and seis-mology are esoteric topics until one understands how they are used in the design of safer automo-biles, better pharmaceuticals, frost - resistant vari-eties of crops, and new oil wells. The activities in this chapter will help students understand the signi cance of scienti c research to the develop- ment of technology and the relevance of scienti c and technological developments to their everyday lives. Understanding the relationship of science, technology, and society is foundational to scien-ti c literacy. Signi cance of Science Activity 4.1.1 focuses on the signi cance of chemistry to society by discussing chemical prod-ucts that have altered agriculture, food, health, medicine, transportation, electronics, technology, the household, and the environment. This activity can be adapted to discuss the signi cance of phys- ics, biology, and the earth and space sciences. For example, the class can discuss the signi cance of biological discoveries to agriculture (plant breed-ing, bioengineered crops, hormone treatments, cloning), food (nutritional requirements, meta-bolic disorders, pasteurization, diets for those with diabetes), and other areas. T eachers should consider dividing the class into study groups and assigning each a speci c connection to investi- gate. The groups can then share their information with other students through class presentations or electronically through a news group, Web site, or related medium. Relevance of Science Activity 4.1.2 focuses on the relevance of physics to other elds of study by giving speci c exam- ples of how physics principles provide a richer understanding of music, botany, health, geology, biology, chemistry, geology, astronomy, literature, 58 c04.indd 58 c04.indd 58 5/9/08 12:44:29 PM 5/9/08 12:44:29 PMScience, Technology, and Society 59 and inventions to learn that science is a grow- ing and developing eld that will ultimately yield many new innovations and inventions for them and generations to follow. 4.1 Science and Society ACTIVITY 4.1.1 The Signi cance of Chemistry to Society Many people have an inaccurate understanding of chemistry and chemists. Chemists rarely appear in the movies or other media, and when shown, they often are portrayed as unkempt, isolated, asocial individuals or as \" mad scientists \" bent on destruc-tion. Similarly, many people view all chemicals as hazardous, not realizing that their very bodies, the clothing they wear, and the houses they live in are made of chemicals. Chemistry is the study of matter, and chemists study the properties and uses of matter. Chemists often develop new substances that have practical signi cance to society, yet they rarely get media attention for their discoveries or developments. Many of these products have life - saving potential, such as sodium azide, which powers automobile air bags; epinephrine, which prevents anaphylactic shock in those allergic to bee stings; and tempered glass, which eliminates the threat of glass cuts in automobile accidents. Many chemical products are less glamorous yet support our way of life. For example, chemists have been involved in the devel-opment and study of virtually everything in your classroom. The paint on the wall, the linoleum or concrete on the fl oor, the gas in the fl uorescent lights, the ink in your pens, and the dyes in your clothing are but a few of the many things in your room that were developed by chemists. Chemistry is a basic science and is foundational to an understanding of other sciences, such as biol-ogy (biochemistry, molecular genetics), physiology (nutrition, metabolism) geology (geochemistry), and physics (nuclear physics). In the activities that follow you will investigate the signi cance of chemistry to the world around you by considering the products that are made possible because of the work of chemists. sports, shop, home economics, history, govern- ment, math, drama, business, foreign languages, and computers. This activity can be adapted to show the relevance of other sciences as well. For example, it can be shown that an understanding of earth science leads to a better understanding of health (asbestosis, earthquake preparedness, pol-len count), business (mineral exploration, mining, seismic retro tting), and other elds. Science Careers and Guest Speakers The section on science - related careers will help students see the importance of science to the econ-omy. Students are encouraged to write research reports on careers of their choice but should realize that some of the job titles listed are very speci c, and it may be necessary to generalize their research to gain suf cient information. We encourage teachers to invite guest speakers to their classes to discuss science - related careers. T eachers can gather information about potential parent guest speakers through voluntary student surveys, letters to parents, Web site notices, or personal conversations with parents at open house and back - to - school night. In addition, many science - and technology - related businesses provide guest speakers or offer company tours. When inviting guest speakers to your class, provide them clear expectations regarding the top-ics you wish them to discuss and the time frame they will have with your students. Encourage them to bring handouts and Internet addresses for fur-ther information. The Infl uence of Science on Technology and Medicine Activity 4.4.2 focuses on the infl uence of science on technology and medicine. I have provided a list of some of the most signi cant inventions and inventors of the past four hundred years. Students research the signi cance of these inventions to society and investigate the scienti c principles that made them possible. After researching inventions of the past, students focus on current discoveries c04.indd 59 c04.indd 59 5/9/08 12:44:30 PM 5/9/08 12:44:30 PM60 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Chemistry and agriculture. Agriculture is the most basic profession; without it we would starve, yet the percentage of farmers in the labor force has declined steadily for many years. In 1900, about 41 percent of the United States labor force worked on farms, but by 2000, less than 2 percent did (Figure 4.1 ). This monumental shift in the labor force resulted from increasing agricultural ef - ciency due largely to advances in agricultural chemistry. Research and describe one or more types of agricultural chemicals that infl uence the way we raise crops and animals (see Figure 4.2 ; Figure 4.1 U.S. Agricultural Workforce, in Percentage 051015202530354045 1900 1930 1945 1970 2000 AGRICULTURE fungicidesgrowth regulators feed supplements soil conditionersherbicides analgesics narcotics PRODUCTS adhesives detergents disinfectants plastics lubricants fibers cosmetics dyespolymerspaints ENVIRONMENT air pollutantswater pollutantsacidscarcinogenstoxinsemulsifierscatalystsdioxinsteratogensgreenhouse propellants concretes fuels paints asphalts refrigerants plasticsSIGNIFICANCE OF CHEMISTRY TO SOCIETY Figure 4.2 The Signi cance of Chemistry to Society 12:44:30 PM 5/9/08 12:44:30 PMScience, Technology, and Society 61 fertilizers, soil conditioners, plant growth regula- tors, animal hormones, feed supplements, insecti-cides, rodentcides, herbicides, fungicides). Describe the role these chemicals play in modern agricul-ture, and give three or more speci c examples. Chemistry and foods. Research one or more types of food chemicals (see Figure 4.2 , additives, thickeners, minerals, antioxidants). Describe the role these chemicals play, and provide three or more speci c examples. Chemistry and medicine. Figure 4.3 shows that life expectancy in the United States has increased dramatically since 1900. Much of this increase is due to advances in chemistry that have yielded products that directly or indirectly infl uence health. Research and describe three or more chemical products that have bene ted public health and medicine (see Figure 4.2 ; antibiotics, vaccines, medical plastics, arti cial blood analgesics, antihista-mines, transportation. How has chem- istry infl uenced transportation (see Figure 4.2 )? Research and describe three or more speci c chem- icals or processes that chemists have developed that improve our means of transportation. For example, identify speci c fuels, fuel additives, or vehicular materials that allow us to move faster or more ef - ciently on land and water or in the air and space. Chemistry and household products. It is impossible to escape chemistry, even at home! Look around your house, and identify and research three or more chemicals that have application in household products. For general classi cations of household chemicals, refer to Figure 4.2 . Chemistry and electronics. Computers, elec- tronics, and related technologies are made pos-sible because of a variety of chemicals with very speci c properties. Identify and research three or more chemicals that are essential to computers or other high - tech applications (see Figure 4.2 ), and explain how the speci c properties of these chem- icals have facilitated the technology revolution. Chemistry and the environment. Many indus- trial and household chemicals have adverse effects on the environment, and chemists are employed to nd ways of reducing these problems (see Figure 4.2 ). Research and describe three or more environmental problems that have a chemical basis or chemical solutions or both chemical bases and solutions. For example, you may research the chemistry of air and water pollution, the green-house effect, environmental toxins, and the ways chemists address these and other chemically related environmental problems. ACTIVITY 4.1.2 The Signi cance of Physics to Society Adapt Activity 4.1.1 for physics. Show the signi cance of physics to each of these seven areas (agriculture, foods, medicine, transportation, household products, electronics, and environment) or other areas (energy, defense, engineering, manu-facturing, and communications) by giving speci c examples of products or processes that have been made available by an understanding of physics. 4.2 Science and Other Subjects Relevance of Physics to Other Fields of Study Physics is the most basic science because it is concerned with the nature and properties of mat-ter and energy. Physics studies mechanics, heat, light, radiation, sound, electricity, magnetism, 46.348.371.179.7 0102030405060708090 1900 1950 2000years65.674.3male female Figure 4.3 U.S. Life Expectance at Birth, 1900, 1950, and 2000 c04.indd 61 5/9/08 12:44:32 PM 5/9/08 12:44:32 PM62 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science and the nature of matter, and it is essential for an understanding of other sciences, such as chemistry, biology, physiology, geology, meteorology, astron-omy, health, and environmental science. Physics also helps us understand seemingly unrelated elds, such as music, art, literature, political sci- ence, history, sports, and home economics, as the following examples illustrate. Relevance of Physics to Music Sound waves: Music is an artistic expression in the form of organized vibrations. Vibrating strings in string instruments and columns of air in wind instruments generate sound by vibrating at fundamental fre-quencies or multiples of these frequencies known as harmonics. An octave is a harmonic that is dou- ble or half the frequency of a given note. Sound travels as longitudinal, compression waves, the fre-quency of which determines the pitch, and the amplitude of which determines the volume. Law of strings: The rst law of strings states that the frequency at which a string vibrates is inversely proportional to its length : f/f ' /H11005 l ' /l ; where f /H11005 orig- inal frequency, f ' /H11005 new frequency, l /H11005 original length, and l ' /H11005 new length. Thus, the musician can play a higher note on a guitar, banjo, violin, or other stringed instrument by shortening the length of the string. T o facilitate this, these instru-ments are equipped with narrow lateral ridges underneath the strings known as frets. The musi- cian presses the wire against these frets to shorten the length of the string that is plucked. A second law of strings states that the frequency of a string is directly proportional to the square root of its tension : f /H20907 f ' /H11005 /H20906/H33524 T / /H20906/H33524 T\u00b4 , where T represents tension. Thus, if the tension on a string is quadrupled, the fre-quency of the string is doubled ( f ' /H11005 f /H20906/H33524 T /H11032 )//H20906/H33524 T ) . All string instruments are tuned by adjusting the tension of the strings. Relevance of Physics to Art Frequency, wavelength, color: Red, green, and blue are the fun- damental colors of light, and by mixing them in different ratios, you can obtain any desired color. Stage lights, televisions, and monitors mix red, green, and blue to get the desired colors by addition of lights. This is known as additive mixing. The mix- ing of red, green, and blue light produces white light. By contrast, cyan, yellow, and magenta are the three fundamental pigments that can be com-bined in different ratios to produce a wide variety of colors of paint, dye, or ink. Pigments refl ect light, and therefore the more pigments that are present, the less light is refl ected. When pigments are mixed, colors are subtracted, The mixing of cyan, yellow, and magenta pigments produces a black pigment that refl ects no light. Artists who under- stand the properties of light and pigments can achieve the desired effects for their artwork. Center of mass: The center of mass is a point representing the mean position of the matter in a body or system. Many works of art rely on the principle that an object will return to stable equi-librium as long as its center of mass passes within the base of support or below the pivot point. Ancient sculptors used this principle to ensure stability of sculptures, and more recent art, such as Alexander Calder ' s kinetic sculptures or mobiles (Figure 4.4 ), are dramatic illustrations of this principle. Relevance of Physics to Literature Physics terms: Physics terms are frequently used in litera- ture to explain events in everyday life. For example, authors may use terms such as quantum leap, free fall, light - years, black holes, leverage, force, power, inertia, energy, work, resonance, and phrases such as \" on the same wavelength, \" \" magnetic attraction, \" and \" gaining momentum \" to explain by analogy to physics concepts. center of mass is located on dotted line Figure 4.4 Center of Mass in a Mobile c04.indd 62 c04.indd 62 5/9/08 12:44:36 PM 5/9/08 12:44:36 PMScience, Technology, and Society 63 Physics authors : Great physics literature has had a profound infl uence on science and literature. Nicholas Copernicus ( On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, 1543), Johannes Kepler ( A New Astronomy, 1609), and Isaac Newton ( Principia \u2014 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, 1687) are a few of the physics authors who popu-larized scienti c writing as an acceptable literary form. More recently, books on exotic theories in physics, such as Stephen Hawking ' s best - selling A Brief History of Time (2002), have provided themes for movies, ctional literature, and pop culture. Relevance of Physics to Political Science Bosons/atomic structure: The Higgs boson is a hypo- thetical massive scalar elementary particle. T o test for the existence of this particle and to further stud-ies in the basic nature of matter, Congress approved the development of the superconducting super col- lider (SSC), a multibillion - dollar facility. Various congressmen argued to have it in their district because of the prestige and jobs it would create, and eventually construction was started on an 87 km circumference underground collider in T exas. Debate again erupted in Congress, and in 1993 the project was canceled when it was decided the gov-ernment did not have the funds to build the collider and the International Space Station simultaneously, leaving a $ 2 billion hole in T exas. Nuclear X - ray laser: A nuclear X - ray laser was designed at Lawrence Livermore laboratories in California, and President Ronald Reagan was told of its potential for destroying enemy missiles. In his famous Star Wars speech, Reagan said, \" I call upon the scienti c community who gave us nuclear weapons to turn their great talents to the cause of mankind and world peace: to give us the means of rendering these nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete. \" Reagan initiated the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a multibillion - dollar program, to develop this technology. There was much criti-cism of the program, and it failed to achieve its goals before being abandoned by the Clinton administration. The George W. Bush administra-tion revived the program and the national missile defense, and in 2005 a test missile was intercepted using the physics principles discovered and the technology developed in the program. Relevance of Physics to History Special relativity and nuclear ssion: In 1905 Albert Einstein published his theory of special relativ- ity, suggesting that a small amount of mass could be converted into a huge amount of energy ( E /H11005 mc 2 ). Further discoveries by physicists Rutherford, James Chadwick, Enrico Fermi, and Leo Szil \u00e1 rd produced additional information about the nature of matter and the potential to develop a nuclear bomb. Albert Einstein warned President Roosevelt that the Nazis might develop a nuclear weapon, and the president decided to initiate the Manhattan Project, which resulted in the design, production, and detonation of three atomic bombs in 1945. The bombs hastened the end of World War II and opened the nuclear arms race of the cold war between the Soviet Union and the United States. Levers and torque: The principle of leverage has been applied for thousands of years in the building of civilizations. The ancient Egyptians used levers to upright obelisks weighing in excess of 100 tons. In the third century b.c., Archimedes wrote, \" Give me the place to stand, and I shall move the earth, \" illustrating his understanding that levers can be used to multiply force (when the effort is farther from the fulcrum than the load). Alternatively, levers magnify speed if the effort is inside the ful-crum. First - class levers (the effort and load are on opposite sides of the fulcrum) are found in oars (used to move ancient galleys and modern row-boats), trebuchets (medieval siege engines), and many tools such as wrenches and pliers. Second - class levers (the effort is beyond the load on same side of fulcrum) are found in wheelbarrows and nutcrackers, and third - class levers (the effort is before the load on the same side of the fulcrum) are found in hoes, scythes, brooms, and catapults to amplify speed. Imagine how different the world would be if these tools had not been developed. Relevance of Physics to Sports Inertia: Inertia is a property of matt er by which it continues c04.indd 63 c04.indd 63 5/9/08 12:44:37 PM 5/9/08 12:44:37 PM64 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science in its existing state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless that state is changed by an external force. Newton ' s rst law describes inertia: an object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction, unless acted on by an outside force. This principle is important in contact sports such as football and boxing. Football coaches recruit heavier players to serve as linemen, knowing that their greater mass will mean greater inertia and make it more dif cult for the oppos- ing team to penetrate the line. Boxers compete only against others in their weight class (bantam- weight, featherweight, lightweight, middleweight, and heavy weight) because unequal weights would create uneven matches due to differences in iner-tia. Rotational inertia is useful in sports such as bicycling and ice skating. Bicyclists maintain their upright position due to the rotational inertia of the wheels, and ice skaters adjust the rate of their spin by changing the moment of inertia as they move their arms or legs. Impulse and momentum: Momentum ( p ) is the product of mass and velocity ( p /H11005 mv ). Impulse ( I ) is the product of force and time ( I /H11005 F /H9254 t, for constant force) and changes momentum F /H9254 t /H11005 mv. Baseball players want to increase the time of contact with the bat ( /H9254 t ) to increase the veloc- ity ( v ) imparted to the ball. When catching a ball, baseball players recoil to increase the time ( /H9254 t ) of the impulse, and thereby decrease the force ( F ) necessary to stop the ball. Football running backs who have large mass ( m ) and are fast ( v ) will have greater momentum and be more dif cult to stop. Relevance of Physics to Home Economics Convection, conduction, radiation: Thermodyna- mics studies the movement of energy and the effect of energy on movement. It helps us understand how conventional ovens, convection ovens, and microwave ovens work. Conventional ovens trans- fer heat to food by radiation (radiant energy from the fl ame or heating element reaches the food), convection (warm air in the oven moves past the food, transferring energy to it), or conduction (metal racks or pans conduct heat to the food). Convection ovens are more effective because they have fans that move air past the food. Microwave ovens send microwave radiation (2450 MHz) through food. Water, sugar, and fat molecules absorb energy through dielectric heating as they vibrate in the alternating electric eld induced by the oven. Thermal conductivity: Thermal conductivity is an intensive property of matter that describes the tendency to conduct heat. Copper has a ther-mal conductivity of 386 W \u00b7 m /H11002 1 \u00b7 K /H11002 1 while iron has a conductivity of only 80 W \u00b7 m /H11002 1 \u00b7 K /H11002 1 . To increase the transfer of heat to food, manufactur-ers coat the bottoms of pots and pans with copper. T o increase the speed of cooking turkeys or other large items, cooks use aluminum cooking pins that conduct heat into the food. ACTIVITY 4.2.1 The Relationship of Physics to Other Subjects Figure 4.5 shows a variety of classes commonly taught in secondary schools. Unfortunately, we often see these classes as distinct entities with no overlap or relationship to one another. Although the curricular emphasis of each class may be unique, the concepts are not. Information from one class is often helpful for another. For example, the gram-matical rules students learn in English class help MusicBotanyChemistrySports History Government Home EconComputersForeign Lang. Business ArtBiologyDramaMathShop AstronomyLiterature Health GeologyPhysics additive color s \u2014 stage lightin g Figure 4.5 Diagram for Giving Examples of How Physics Principles Are Used in Other Classes c04.indd 64 c04.indd 64 5/9/08 12:44:37 PM 5/9/08 12:44:37 PMScience, Technology, and Society 65 them understand the rules in other languages, and an understanding of American government helps in understanding the events of American history. Most students, however, see little connection between physics and other classes because these connections were not made explicit in readings or lectures. The following list sets out a physics principle, and then an example of a phenomenon it explains. Read each description, and identify a class other than physics for which this information is useful. Write the summary relationship on the appropri-ate connecting lines in Figure 4.5 (the rst is given as an example). Y our completed diagram will illus-trate how physics principles are used in all of these classes. 1 . Additive colors stage lighting. A color gel, or lter, is a translucent or transparent colored material used in theaters to produce colored light-ing. By illuminating red, green, and blue (the fundamental colors of light) gels in different pro-portions, lighting experts use the principle of color addition to achieve the desired color and mood. 2. Wave interference tuning. Beats are periodic fl uctuations in the intensity of a sound when two sound waves of slightly different fre-quencies interfere. A musician can tune a stringed instrument by using a tuning fork of known fre-quency and changing the tension on a string of the same note until no beats are heard. 3 . Bernoulli ' s principle curve ball. Pitchers put a spin on baseballs to cause them to curve. The air carried along by the stitching on the side of a spinning baseball travels faster relative to the sur-rounding air than does the air on the other side where the surface motion is opposite the move-ment of the ball. According to Bernoulli ' s princi-ple, faster - moving fl uids experience lower pressure, causing the baseball to veer to the side where the surface motion is in the same direction as the ball ' s forward movement. 4. Buoyancy swim bladder. Gas - lled sacs located on the dorsal side of sh are known as gas or swim bladders and are used to control buoyancy. When gases are introduced into the bladder, sh become slightly larger, displace more water, and become more buoyant according to Archimedes ' principle. When gases are absorbed from the bladder into the bloodstream, sh dis- place less water, becomes less buoyant, and sink. 5 . Circuits microprocessors. Microprocessors are digital electronic components with mini-aturized transistors on a single semiconductor integrated circuit and often serve as the central processing unit for computers and related devices. Microprocessors rely on numerous miniature cir-cuits to perform logic functions. 6 . Coulomb ' s law ionic bonding. Coulomb ' s law states that the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point charges is directly pro-portional to the magnitudes of each charge and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Electrostatic bonds form between two ions when the distances between them are small. 7 . Physics terms cognates . Cognates are words in different la nguages that have the same linguistic roots. Most English physics terms have cognates in other languages. For example, the English word thermodynamics has the follow- ing cognates: termodin 8 . Evaporative cooling refrigeration . Energy is required to evaporate liquids. Heat is removed from the body to evaporate sweat, causing body temperature to drop. Refrigerators and freezers use this same principle. Compressors on the out-side of the refrigerator liquefy ammonia or other refrigerant, releasing heat to the room. The refrig-erant is pumped to tubes inside the unit, where it evaporates, removing heat from the surrounding air, and causing the temperature to drop. 9 . Sound intensity inverse square law . The surface area of a sphere is 4 /H9266 r 2 , where r represents the radius. Assuming sound expands spherically from a point source, such as an omnidirectional speaker, its intensity (power per unit area) falls off as the inverse square of the radius from the source ( I /H11005 P /4 /H9266 r 2 ) as the same amount of power is dis- tributed over an ever - expanding spherical surface. 1 0 . Heat engine industrial revolution . A heat engine converts heat energy to mechanical work by using the temperature gradient between c04.indd 65 c04.indd 65 5/9/08 12:44:38 PM 5/9/08 12:44:38 PM66 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science a warmer \" source \" and a cooler \" sink, \" according to the laws of thermodynamics. The development of the rst practical steam engine by James Watt spurred the industrial revolution. 11. Photons photosynthesis. Photons are quanta of light that can be perceived as waves or particles, depending on how they are measured. Photons are captured by antenna complexes in chlorophyll within the chloroplasts of plant cells, and their energy is ultimately used to produce sugars and oxygen. Virtually all life is dependent on the products of photosynthesis. 1 2 . Physics literature realism . Romanticism, a popular literary movement in late eighteenth - century Europe, emphasized strong emotion and imagination. Publication of an increasing number of scienti c works in the middle of the nineteenth century ushered in a new literary movement known as realism, which deemphasized emotion and imagination and focused on reality as de ned by the methods of science. 1 3 . Ram pressure meteors. Ram pressure is the pressure exerted on supersonic bodies traveling through a fl uid such as air. Meteors may travel in excess of 15 km per second, causing violent com-pression of air in front of them. Compressional heating, combined with frictional forces on the meteor, causes the meteor to become extremely hot and glow, making it appear as a \" shooting star. \" 1 4 . Physics research appropriations . The large electron positron collider in Switzerland is a circular tube 3.8 m (12 ft 6 in.) in diameter and 27 km (17 mi) in circumference and has been used to study the smallest particles of matter by accelerating electrons and positrons that collided with each other. The establishment of such an expensive research facility was accomplished only because of political and economic support from 20 European countries. Such political and economic cooperation was also necessary to establish the International Space Station (ISS), a joint project of NASA (United States), the Russian Federal Space Agency, the European Space Agency, the Japan Aerospace Exploration agency, the Canadian Space Agency, and the Brazilian Space Agency. 15. Subtractive pigments paint mixing . The three primary colors of light our eyes see are red, green, and blue. Pigments absorb some wave- lengths of light and refl ect others. Artists use cyan, magenta, and yellow (the same three colors in a color printer) dyes to create the myriad of colors we see in a painting. Cyan dyes absorb red light and refl ect blue and green, which our brains per- ceive as cyan. Magenta dyes absorb green light and refl ect red and blue, which our brains perceive as magenta. Y ellow dyes absorb blue light and refl ect red and green light, which our brains perceive as yellow. Thus, if you mix cyan and magenta dyes, red and green light will be absorbed so that the sur-face refl ects only blue. Similarly, if cyan and yellow are mixed, red and blue are absorbed so that only green is refl ected. Finally, if yellow and magenta are mixed, blue and green are absorbed so that only red is refl ected. If cyan, magenta, and yellow are mixed, then red, green and blue are absorbed, and the sur-face appears black. Mixing of pigments results in the subtraction (absorption) of more wavelengths of light and is used to create a myriad of colors. Artists have used this principle for centuries to cre-ate the variety of colors exhibited in such works as Leonardo da Vinci ' s Mona Lisa, Vincent van Gogh ' s Starry Night, and Paul C \u00e9 zanne ' s Still Life. 16. Technological applications venture capital . As physicists study the nature of matter and energy, they often discover principles that have potential applications in technology. It was noted that car-bon dust adheres electrostatically to paper that has been illuminated. When an image is projected on the page, carbon toner particles are attracted to the electrostatic latent image, creating a visible image. Although this technique was developed by Chester Carlton in 1938, it wasn ' t until a great deal of venture capital was poured into research and development that the photocopier became a con-sumer product. In 1959 the Xerox Company intro-duced the rst one - piece plain paper photocopier, and in the decades that followed, many patient investors became millionaires off the money had they invested as the company expanded and stock prices soared. Venture capital is sometimes neces-sary to make useful products from the discoveries physicists make. 17. Torque wrenches . T orque causes rotation and is de ned as F /H11003 r, where F is the force and c04.indd 66 c04.indd 66 5/9/08 12:44:39 PM 5/9/08 12:44:39 PMScience, Technology, and Society 67 r is the radius (torque arm) between the pivot and applied force. T orque is directly proportional to the length of the torque arm. Thus, a mechanic can develop twice the torque on a nut simply by using a wrench that is twice as long. 18. Radiation cancer . Electromagnetic radiation can have a physiological effect only if it is absorbed. Radio waves stream through the body continuously but have no physiological effect because they are not absorbed. Infrared and visible light are absorbed by the skin and warm the body but do not have suf cient energy to cause tissue damage. Ultraviolet light, however, is strongly absorbed by the skin and has suf cient energy to ionize molecules and cause genetic errors. It is responsible for various forms of skin can-cer. Higher - energy radiation, such as X - rays and gamma rays, although absorbed less by tissues, can cause mutations and cancer or can be focused to kill malignant tissues in the process of radiation therapy. 19. Wave refl ection oil exploration . New oil deposits are found using geophysical techniques such as the refl ection of shock waves. Explosives are detonated in the ground or water, and scien-tists watch for refl ections using seismometers or hydrophones. Oil deposits refl ect shock waves dif- ferently than they do surrounding rock, allowing scientists to predict potential oil reserves. ACTIVITY 4.2.2 Relationship of Chemistry to Other Subjects Create a diagram like Figure 4.5 , but put chemistry in the center box. Then write connections between chemistry and other subjects on the connecting lines. Y ou may select principles of chemistry that help you understand other subjects, or principles from other subjects related to chemistry. Label each line with a connecting idea as illustrated in Figure 4.5 . For example, to connect chemistry and computers, you could discuss the chemical proc-esses for growing the semiconductor crystals that are used in the integrated circuits of comput-ers. On the connecting line between chemistry and computers, write \" semiconductor crystals ( chemistry) \u2014 integrated circuits (computers). \" ACTIVITY 4.2.3 The Relationship of Biology to Other Subjects Create a diagram like Figure 4.5 , but put biol-ogy in the center box.

Y ou may select principles of biology that help you understand other subjects, or principles from other subjects related to biology. Label each line with a connecting idea as illustrated in Figure 4.5 . For example, to connect biology and geology, you could discuss the processes in which the plant materials in swamp ecosystems are gradually com-pacted, chemically altered, and metamorphosed by heat and pressure to form coal. On the connecting between biology and geology write \" swamp eco-systems (biology) \u2014 coal (geology).\" ACTIVITY 4.2 .

On the connecting line between earth and space science and government write \" planetary science (earth and space science) \u2014 NASA space exploration (government). \" 4.3 Careers in Science Most high school graduates or college freshmen have only a vague idea of what they want to pursue as a career. They may register in college as a biology, chemistry, physics, geology, or astronomy major, but have no idea what they will do when they earn their degree. Y ou are therefore strongly encouraged to take a career and interest survey before gradu-ating from high school. Such surveys and related information are available from the school coun-selor or online through free or commercial serv-ices (for example, sciencesourcebook.com , or search using \" career interest survey \" ). After responding to a series of questions regarding your interests and aptitudes, the surveys identify professions for which c04.indd 67 5/9/08 12:44:39 PM 5/9/08 12:44:39 PM68 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science you might be well suited. Although such tests are helpful in providing ideas, you should also talk to professionals in the eld to gain more insights. Ask your school counselor for more information regard-ing interest surveys, colleges, and career contacts.

T oday such surgeries are common, and there are abdo-minal, thoracic, and brain surgery specialties. \" This ' telephone ' has too many shortcom- ings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us. \" Western Union internal memo, Agrochemist Analytical chemistAnesthesiologistAquatic chemistAssayerAtmospheric chemistBiochemistChemical analystChemical assistantResearch chemistSpectroscopistTechnical writer Table 4.2 Careers Req uiring a Back ground in Chemistry Careers Requiring a Background in Physics c04.indd 70 c04.indd 70 5/9/08 12:44:40 PM and Society 71 1876. T oday wireless phone communication is common throughout the world. \" I have always consistently opposed high - tension and alternating systems of electric lighting (AC current) . . . not only on account of danger, but because of their general unreli-ability and unsuitability for any general system of distribution. \" 2 Thomas Edison, 1889. T oday power lines deliver alternating current to virtually every household and business in the United States. People have become accustomed to change and expect rapid developments in science and technology, but as these quotations show, this has not always been so. Each day brings new discov-eries or innovations in science, technology, and medicine, many of which may eventually infl uence our life or culture signi cantly. Scientists provide the basic research to discover new principles, and engineers apply these concepts to produce new products that change the way we live and work. ACTIVITY 4.4.1 Science and the Develop- ment of Technology Table 4.5 lists many of the most signi cant inven- tions and inventors of the past four centuries. Each of these inventions has played a signi cant role in society, and each is dependent on the scienti c and technological discoveries of others who went before. For example, Hans Lippershey is cred-ited with designing the rst practical telescope, but his work was preceded by ancient Greeks and Romans who rst developed convex glass lenses for starting res, and by Pliny and Seneca who described the magnifying effect of a glass globe lled with water. Lippershey used the collective knowledge of spectacle makers and lens crafters when assembling his rst telescope. Galileo was one of the rst to use Lippershey ' s design, and from it he developed an improved telescope that led to the discovery of four of Jupiter ' s moons, the phases of Venus, the transit of Mercury, and evidence verifying the Copernican heliocentric model of the solar system. Thus, Lippershey ' s tel-escope, which was based on principles discovered by ancient Greeks and Romans, contributed to the development of modern astronomy and science. Select one or more of the inventions from Table 4.5 .

Exhibit 4.2 Sample Report on the Steel Plow (1) Invention : John Deere produced the rst commercial steel plow in 1837. (2) Scienti c principles : An alloy is a mixture of two or more elements, at least one of which is a metal. Alloys may have different properties from their component elements. Metallurgists worked for centuries perfecting steel, an alloy of iron and carbon (0.02 % -1.7 % by weight) that is substantially harder than iron. John Deere selected steel for his plows because it was hard to break up the tough sod of the American Great Plains. (3) Impact of invention : The steel plow made it possible to cultivate grasslands and led to the rapid growth and settlement of the Great Plains, as well as the demise of native prairie ecosystems. The steel plow paved the way for a variety of steel - based agricultural machines (seeders, planters, combines, harvesters) that increased ef ciency while reducing the need for farmers, thereby increasing productivity while accelerating migration to the cities. c04.indd 73 c04.indd 73 5/9/08 12:44:42 PM 5/9/08 12:44:42 PM74 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Ways of Summarizing Science and Technology Articles 1 .

T oday most science textbooks de ne the scienti c method as a technique in which the researcher de nes a problem, makes observations, generates a hypothesis, designs an experiment to test this hypothesis, and uses data from this exper-iment to draw conclusions concerning the valid-ity of the hypothesis so he or she can answer the research question. The scienti c method is often presented in outline form: Research question : De ne the question to be answered. Observations: Make observations related to this question. Hypothesis: Offer a possible explanation. c05.indd 79 PM 5/9/08 5:55:06 PM80 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science velocity, distance). Quantitative data are displayed in scatter plots or histograms. Categorical (qualitative) variables: A categori- cal variable includes data grouped on a given property, such as genus, chemical family, or population. Categorical data are best displayed in bar graphs or pie charts. Control: A control is a subject or object in an experiment that is not involved in the proce-dures affecting the rest of the experiment, thus acting as a standard against which experimen-tal results can be compared. Constants: These are factors that are held con- stant during an experiment. T o determine the effect of an independent variable on a depend-ent variable, all other potential factors must be held constant. 5.1 Discrepant Events: Establishing a \" Need to Know \" Early bacteriologists and microbiologists deter- mined to identify microbes involved in disease. Such a task was challenging for early work-ers, and samples were often contaminated by fungi and other microorganisms. In 1928, a researcher by the name of Alexander Fleming was studying a group of bacteria ( staphylococci ) when he noticed a slight discrepancy in their growth pattern. Bacteria that would normally cover the growth medium were not found near spots of fungal contamina-tion. These observations were not consistent with Fleming ' s prior experiences, and he immediately set out to determine the cause for this discrepancy. After much research, Fleming isolated a substance from the mold that inhibits the growth of bacte-ria and named it penicillin. T en years later, English researchers Ernst Chain and Howard Florey dem-onstrated the therapeutic effects of penicillin in the treatment of bacterial infections. Penicillin became the rst widespread antibiotic and has since saved many lives. One man ' s interest in a slight discrepancy (the lack of bacteria surrounding fungal con-tamination) led to many subsequent discoveries, Experiment: Design an experiment to test the validity of this hypothesis. Conclusions: Evaluate the hypothesis in the light of experimental data, and offer an answer to the research question. Although many science textbooks imply that there is but one scienti c method (generally in this form), the Nobel Prize - winning physicist Percy Bridgman states, \" There are as many scien-ti c methods as there are individual scientists. \" Bridgman says that the scientist \" is not consciously following any prescribed course of action, but feels complete freedom to utilize any method or device whatever, which in the particular situation before him seems likely to yield the correct answer. In his attack on his speci c problem he suffers no inhibi- tions of precedent or authority, but is completely free to adopt any course that his ingenuity is capa-ble of suggesting to him. \" 2 Bridgman ' s comments are a good reminder that science is a creative endeavor and that scien-tists are not restricted to a cookbook methodology in their pursuit of knowledge. Nonetheless, the sci-enti c method, as commonly presented, is a good tool for learning how to answer problems, and like any other tool, it is best understood through use. In this chapter, students will employ the sci- enti c method in a variety of ways to answer real problems. They will also use scienti c vocabulary, including the following key terms: Key Terminology Related to the Scienti c Method Variable: A variable is something that is capable of changing or varying. Independent variable: An independent vari- able is independent of others. A change in the dependent variable does not cause a change in the independent variable. In most graphs it is plotted on the x - axis. Dependent variable: A dependent variable depends on the independent variable. A change in the independent variable may cause a change in the dependent variable. Quantitative variable: A quantitative variable has numerical values (height, age, temperature, c05.indd 80 c05.indd 80 5/9/08 5:55:06 PM 5/9/08 5:55:06 PMEmploying Scienti c Methods 81 and ultimately the introduction of antibiotics. Students, like researchers, tend to pay more atten-tion if something does not behave the way they expect it to. Such discrepant events engender curi-osity and stimulate a need to know. Those who have a need to know are likely to investigate in more depth. Educators employ discrepant events in an effort to capture student interest and provide parameters in which students will naturally develop a need to know. In this section, we intro-duce a few discrepant events and many more may be found in Hands - On Physics with Real - Life Applications and Hands - On Chemistry with Real - Life Applications. 3 ACTIVITY 5.1.1 A Reversible, Spon taneous Color hydroxide, fl asks, dextrose. We are not accustomed to seeing liquids spon- taneously change color, much less revert back to their original color when shaken. In this demon-stration, the teacher lls a fl ask with a liquid that turns blue when shaken (Figure 5.1A ), but reverts to clear when allowed to stand (Figure 5.1B ). This discrepant event can be used to introduce the importance of observation in the scienti c method. The teacher should put on protective eyewear and a lab coat. Add the following to an Erlenmeyer fl ask: 200 mL of 0.5 M potassium hydroxide (5.7 grams KOH in 200 mL water; allow to cool before adding other substances), 7 grams of dextrose (glucose), and a few drops of methylene blue indi-cator solution (or approximately 0.5 g of methyl-ene blue powder). In a basic solution, methylene blue is reduced to its colorless state: reducing environme ent methylene blue (colorless)reduced Methylene blue may be subsequently oxidized by shaking the fl ask vigorously. Atmospheric oxy- gen dissolves into solution, oxidizing methylene blue to ironment methylene blue fl ask to stand undis- turbed until it returns to clear. This process can be repeated numerous times. When students observe this phenomenon, they will start to ask questions concerning how it works. The teacher can use this discrepant event to whet student curiosity about science or launch an exploration of the underlying principles of oxida-tion and reduction. ACTIVITY 5.1.2 The Collapsing Can: Teacher Demonstration Materials: 12 oz soda can, water, hot plate, beaker tongs, safety goggles, lab coat. This is a teacher demonstration only. Put on goggles and a laboratory coat. Obtain a large beaker or bucket, and ll it with water. Pour water into an empty, opened, aluminum soft drink can to a depth of approxi-mately 1 cm, and place the can on a hot plate until the water boils (Figure 5.2A ). Do not allow the can to boil dry! After the water has boiled (watch for steam) for approximately 1 minute, use tongs to remove the can from the heat source and place it in an upright position with the base in water (Figure 5.2B ). Students will notice no changes in the can. Repeat the process, but this time invert the can and submerge the opening in the water, as illustrated in (Figure 5.2C) . This time the can will immediately collapse. Ask your students to draw a diagram of the experimental setup and indicate 100300400500 200500 ml Pyrex swirl (blue)reducing B Figure 5.1 Spontaneous Color 5/9/08 5:55:07 PM 5/9/08 5:55:07 PM82 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science where the pressure must be highest and where it must be lowest to produce the observed results. When 1 mL of water boils (vaporizes), it changes into approximately 1000 mL of steam. As the water in the soft drink can boils, it displaces air originally in the can. When the can is sealed and cooled, steam condenses to liquid water but now occupies only approximately 1/1000 the volume it occupied as steam. In other words, for every 1 mL of steam that condenses inside the sealed can, approximately 999 mL of vacuum are left behind. The air pressure outside the can remains the same while the pressure inside drops, creating a pressure differential that collapses the can. Air pressure can also be illustrated in a very dramatic manner by using a resealable metal can such as those used to package paint thinner and other solvents. The instructor should make certain the can is completely clean and dry prior to the dem-onstration or else dangerous fumes may enter the atmosphere when the can is heated. Seal the can, and ask a student to crush it with his or her hands. It will be very dif cult for the student to do much more than dent the sealed can because the air inside resists compression. Remove the lid and cover the threads with plumb-er ' s T efl on tape. Add water to a depth of 1 cm and heat unsealed until the water boils (Figure 5.3A ). Never heat a sealed container! Using potholders, remove the can from the heat, and seal with the lid (Figure 5.3B ). Do not reseal the can while it is being heated, or an explosion may occur. As the can is allowed to cool on a bench top, it will gradually collapse as the water vapor condenses and the internal pressure drops to a fraction of the external atmospheric pressure. Cooling the outside of the can with water or a damp cloth will acceler-ate this process. Students can calculate the force on the can by calculating the surface area ( A ) and then solving the equation F /H11005 PA, where P (atmospheric pressure) is approximately 101,325 N/m 2 . Under normal circumstances, empty cans do not spontaneously collapse, so when students observe them imploding in this activity, their curiosity is immediately aroused. Y ou can use this discrepant event as an introduction to the impor-tance of observation to scienti c method or to introduce students to air pressure and the gas laws. ACTIVITY 5.1.3 Retinal Fatigue: What You Perceive Is Not Always Real!: Teacher Demonstration Materials: overhead transparency; yellow, green, and black overhead pens; overhead projector. When you are photographed with a camera equipped with an electronic fl ash (strobe), you may have noticed a dark afterimage of the strobe long after the fl ash of light disappeared. The fl ash is so intense that it fatigues photoreceptive cells in your retina (see Figure 5.4 ) so they are temporarily unresponsive to light. As a result, a black image of the fl ash appears in your vision. Y our retinas may also fatigue after staring at colored objects for long periods of time. However, when you look toward a white surface, you will not see a black afterimage but rather one that is the complementary color of WWorld's Gr orld's Greatest eatest Cola Cola WWorld's Gr orld's Greatest eatest ColaCola A C B Figure 5.2 The Collapsing Soda Can Empty Can (no lid)airpressure Sealed canNever heat a sealed container!

For example, if you stare intensely for 1 minute at a red dot and then turn your eyes toward a sheet of white paper, you will see a cyan (the complementary color of red) afterimage of the dot. Light refl ected from white paper normally stimulates the red, green, and blue cones (photoreceptive cells) of the retina, but if you have rst fatigued the red cones by staring at a red object, these cells temporarily will not respond to red light. As a result, only the green and blue cones in that region of the retina are stimulated, causing the image to appear cyan (the combination of green and blue light), the complementary color of red! For this activity, color an American fl ag on an overhead transparency using the colors indicated in Figure 5.5 , or project the fl ag image from the companion Web site of this sourcebook ( sciencesourcebook.com ). Instruct your students to cover one eye, and stare intensely at the middle of the fl ag with the other. After 1 minute, remove the transparency, and instruct students to keep their eyes focused on the same point on the white screen. They should soon see the American fl ag, correctly colored in red, white, and blue! Instruct your students to draw a solid red cir- cle on a white sheet of paper using a marker or paintbrush. They should cover one eye, place the circle in bright light, and stare at it. At the end of 1 minute, instruct them to quickly refocus on a well - lit sheet of white paper and ask them to iden-tify the color of the afterimage (it will be cyan). Repeat this process with green and blue dots, and discuss the results. Students should identify magenta as the complementary color of green and yellow as the complementary color of blue. Under normal circumstances, we don ' t see colors where none exist, so when students observe colors when they stare at a sheet of white paper, their curiosity is immediately aroused. Y ou can use this discrepant event as an introduction to the importance of observation in the scienti c method or to introduce students to vision and ret-inal physiology. 5.2 Developing Scienti cally Oriented Questions Michael Faraday (1791 - 1867) was a British sci- entist who invented the rst electric motor and dynamo, demonstrated the relationship between electricity and chemical bonding, and discov-ered the effect of magnetism on light. Faraday was not only a brilliant scientist but also a well - known educator who brought science to the pub-lic through lectures he delivered each Christmas season at the Royal Society in London. 4 Faraday ' s Christmas Lectures were popular because he illus-trated concepts with numerous hands - on activities and experiments. Faraday knew the importance of observa- tion in science and began his most famous lecture series by asking his audience to record as many observations as possible about a burning candle. Even today science teachers use Faraday ' s activity to encourage the development of observation skills.

Hock ' s comments helped Osheroff distinguish observation from inference, and this distinction ultimately helped him in his career as a scientist. c05.indd 84 c05.indd 84 5/9/08 5:55:13 85 ACTIVITY 5.2.1 Observations of a Candle Materials: small candle, matches, tongs, beaker, funnel, clay or putty, bromthymol blue or phenol red indicator, test tube clamp, safety glasses, dull butter knife, lamp oil (optional). The purpose of this activity is to record as many observations of a candle as possible. Refer to Table 5.1 for ideas on the types of observations that may be made. Record your observations in a laboratory notebook or worksheet. Firmly plant a candle in a small clump of clay. Using beaker tongs, suspend a clean, cool beaker over the unlit candle, as illustrated in (Figure 5.6A ), and record your observations. Repeat the proce-dure with a funnel on which there are drops of the pH indicator methylene blue or phenol red (Figure 5.6B ). Does the indicator change color? Put on safety goggles, and light the can- dle. Record all observations (Figure 5.6C ). Using beaker tongs, suspend a cooled beaker over the fl ame, as shown in Figure 5.6D . What observations can you make about the inside of the beaker? Repeat the procedure with a funnel in which there are drops of bromthymol blue (Figure 5.6E ). Place a dry, clean beaker over the fl ame (Figure 5.6F ), and make observations as the fl ame is extinguished. Repeat the procedure with different sizes of glass beakers. Is there any corre-lation between the size of the glass beaker and the time it takes to extinguish the fl ame? Remove the beaker, and relight the candle by placing a match in the smoke near the wick (Figure 5.6G ). Is it possible to relight the candle simply by moving the fl ame into the smoke? Using a dull knife, cut the wick free from the candle, and place one end of the wick in a dish of water. Light the other end of the wick (Figure 5.6H ). What do you observe? Dry the wick off, place it in a dish of lamp oil, and relight it.

Why does it occur? ' and you in the course of time will nd out the answer. \" Write down as many questions as you can based on the observations you made in Activity 5.2.1. For example: What is wax? What is the wick? Why is the wax soft? Why does the wick turn black? Why does the wax melt? Why does the smoke ignite? What is the substance that appears on the glass above the fl ame? Why does the indica- tor turn color when placed over the candle? Do all candles burn the same? 5.3 Observation Versus Inference Science is based largely on observations and infer- ences. An observation is a record resulting from the study of an event or object, whereas an inference is a conclusion drawn from evidence or reasoning based on observations. Unfortunately many people cannot distinguish observations from inferences and use the concepts interchangeably. The follow-ing activities are designed to help students under-stand the differences between observations and inferences and help them use each appropriately. ACTIVITY 5.3.1 Observations Versus Infer - ences of a \" Plant \" \u2014 Teacher Demonstration Place a realistic - looking silk plant with fl owers in a pot containing soil (Figure 5.7A ). Place the plant in the front of the class, and ask your students to record all of their observations of the plant on a sheet of paper. After a few minutes, ask students to read their observations, and list them on the board or an overhead transparency. Do not allow any of your students to discuss the \" observations \" that appear on the list. Because many students do not understand the difference between observation and inference, the list will probably include inferences such as fl ower scent, root structure, photosynthesis, and respiration, in addition to true observations, such as leaf color, leaf shape, and fl ower color. Once the list is complete, pull the plant out of the pot and pass it around the room (Figure 5.7B ). It will now be evident that many of the \" observations \" were merely incorrect inferences made because the students assumed that the plant was real. Draw another column on the list, and ask students to identify which of the \" observations \" should be cat-egorized as inferences. ACTIVITY 5.3.2 Observations versus Inferences of \" Raisidia \" \u2014 Teacher Demonstration \" Raisidia \" is a humorous activity designed to help students differentiate observations from infer-ences. Before class begins, place raisins in a cup of tapwater for at least 20 minutes. During this time, the raisins hydrate, and their densities decrease. Without allowing students to see the raisins, drain off the water, and place them in a tall, clean, clear drinking glass, and ll the glass with a clear car- bonated drink such as lemon - lime soda or club soda. After the zzing has subsided and the raisins begin to bob up and down, present the cup to the students and ask them to make as many observa-tions as possible (Figure 5.8 ). Do not allow the students to approach the container. Y ou may wish to tell them a tall tale about how you collected these \" creatures \" ( raisidia ) in a nearby bog or gutter. When asked 100% silk AB Figure 5.7 Observations Versus Inferences of a \"Plant\" c05.indd Scienti c Methods 87 to make observations, many will describe how the creatures swim to the surface and dive back, or how they congregate on the bottom before swim-ming to the top. Record all of the students ' obser-vations of the \" raisidia \" on the board. After your students complete all of their observations, you may wish to astound them by drinking the con-tents of the glass. Students will be shocked until you pull out the raisin box and tell them that the \" creatures \" are actually raisins. Draw another col-umn on the list and have the students identify which of the \" observations \" should be categorized as inferences. The English scientist William Henry (1774 - 1836) observed that the concentration of gas in a solution increases in a linear fashion as the pres-sure of the gas above the solution increases: C g a s /H11005 k P g a s where C gas /H11005 molar concentration of the gas in the solution, k /H11005 Henry ' s law constant for that gas at a particular temperature, and P gas /H11005 partial pressure of the gas above the solution. Carbonated soft drinks are packaged under pressure, forcing a large amount of carbon diox-ide to dissolve in solution. When a can of carbon-ated soft drink is opened, the external pressure is reduced to atmospheric pressure, and the carbon dioxide comes out of solution as bubbles (the zz). Bubbles of carbon dioxide form on the surface of the submerged raisins, and the raisins are soon buoyed to the surface where the bubbles break, causing the raisins to sink (Figure 5.8 ). This activity illustrates Archimedes ' principle, which states that an object is buoyed up by a force equivalent to the weight of the fl uid displaced. The bubbles on the raisins displace suf cient soft drink so that the buoyant force on the raisins exceeds the force of gravity, and they rise to the surface. When the bubbles break, the raisins displace less fl uid and experience a buoyant force that is less than that of their own weight, causing them to sink once again to the bottom. The raisins will continue to bob up and down until the soda becomes fl at (no more carbon dioxide escapes from solution). 5.4 Brainstorming and Hypothesizing Brainstorming is a group problem - solving tech- nique that involves the spontaneous contribution of ideas from all members of the group. Scientists often hold brainstorming sessions to generate pos-sible solutions to dif cult problems, particularly in the hypothesis generation phase of the scienti c method. Often the comments of one team mem-ber stimulate the thought processes of another, creating a chain reaction of ideas. The follow-ing guidelines should be used in a brainstorming session: Do not discuss or evaluate ideas until the brainstorming session is complete. Focus on quantity, not quality. Y ou want to get many ideas for discussion. Build on the ideas of others, combining or modifying ideas already presented. In the rst activity, students engage in a clas- sic brainstorming session that has been used as a team - building activity in many schools and organ-izations. T eams are told to imagine that they are part of a lunar exploration mission and that their craft has experienced mechanical dif culties, leav- ing them stranded some distance from the lunar research station. They are asked to develop con-sensus regarding the relative value of various items that may be taken with them from the wreckage on their trek to the research station. The activity presented here is a variation of the original exercise, modi ed to encourage Lemon Lime Lemon Lime Soda Soda A BC Figure 5.8 Observations Versus Inferences of \"Raisidia\" c05.indd 87 Sourcebook for Teaching Science brainstorming, consensus building, and evaluative reasoning. Before proceeding with the activity, you may wish to show images and videos of the Moon ' s surface (online at sciencesourcebook.com , or search \" lunar photos \" ) to familiarize students with the lunar environment. ACTIVITY 5.4.1 Lost on the Moon: Brainstorming and Consensus Building Divide students into teams of three to ve mem- bers, and read the following paragraphs aloud to the class: Y ou are members of a scienti c team bound for a permanent research station on the sur-face of the moon. Unfortunately, your lunar craft malfunctions, forcing an emergency landing in Mare Crisium, approximately 300 km from the research station at Mare Serenitatis. Both you and the research station are on the lighted surface of the moon. During the landing process, much of the equipment aboard has been damaged, and since your sur-vival depends on reaching the research station, only the most critical items must be chosen for the trek. These 15 items have been left intact fol-lowing the emergency landing [project the list so everyone can see it]. As a group, you must reach consensus regarding the relative impor-tance of these items in your mission to reach help at the research station. Here is the list of 15 items: box of matches two 100 kg tanks of oxygen stellar map 10 kg dehy- drated food traditional signal fl ares rst aid kit 50 m of nylon rope solar - powered FM radio 10 L water portable heating unit two 45 caliber pistols case of dehy- drated milk life raft magnetic compass parachute silk Now provide these instructions: 1 . Brainstorming: Write down as many ideas as possible regarding the potential use of the 15 items for your trek to the research station. At this time, do not discuss or evaluate the merit of these ideas. 2 . Analysis: Review the maps, photos, movies, and data on the moon available on the Web site. Record the similarities and differences between the Earth and the Moon with respect to gravity, atmosphere, lighting, radiation, magnetic eld, visibility, surface, and so forth. 3 . Evaluation and consensus building: Discuss the merits of the ideas presented during the brain-storming session, and develop a consensus within your group regarding the relative value of each of the items. Place a 1 by the item you value most and a 15 by the item you value least, recording the rationale for your ranking. 4 . Discussion and defense of position: Compare your ranking with those of other groups. If there are differences, discuss them, presenting reasoned arguments for your ranking. ACTIVITY 5.4.2 The Mysterious Bottle: Generating a Hypothesis \u2014 Teacher Demon stration Materials: surgical tubing, pliers, burner, ring stand, nail, beakers, food coloring, utility knife, black electrician ' s tape, foil. A discrepant or counterintuitive event is a dem- onstration or activity that produces unexpected results, causing the observer to ask questions. Y ou can use discrepant events to create an environ-ment in which your students, rather than you, are asking the questions. The \" mysterious bottle \" is a discrepant event that can be used as a brain-storming activity in which students build on each other ' s ideas to surmise the contents of a covered container that exhibits some very unusual proper-ties. They then evaluate each other ' s hypotheses in the light of their observations. The preparation for this activity should be done in a location where none of the students will see how the device is assembled. Obtain a 2 L plastic soda bottle. Put on protective eyewear. Using insulated pliers, hold the tip of a large nail c05.indd 88 c05.indd 88 5/9/08 5:55:21 PM c Methods 89 in the fl ame of a laboratory burner (Figure 5.9A ), and then use the heated nail to melt a hole in the side (near the base, Figure 5.9B ) of the 2 L bot-tle. Slowly move the nail around in a circle until the diameter of the hole is just slightly smaller than the diameter of fl exible latex surgical tub- ing. Using a sharp utility knife or scissors, cut off the top of the bottle as shown in Figure 5.9 . Pinch the end of the tubing so it will t through the hole, and then pull the tubing until it is posi-tioned as shown in Figure 5.9C . T est the seal by adding water to the container. Leakage may occur if you use Tygon or other stiff plastic tubing, or if the hole is too large. Empty the bottle, and place it on a ring stand equipped as illustrated in Figure 5.9C . Place a few drops of blue food coloring in the base of the container, and add water until the level is just below the base of the arch in the tubing. Hide the contents of the container from view by wrap-ping the bottle in aluminum foil and taping the tube that protrudes with black electrician ' s tape (Figure 5.9D ). Place a few drops of red food coloring in a small beaker, and add water. Place the full assem-bly in view of the class. Pour water from the beaker into the bottle until water starts to fl ow out of the exit tube and into a 2 L collection fl ask, beaker, or cylinder. Ask students to record their observations, for example, the amount and color of fl uid added and the amount and color of fl uid that exits. Students will be surprised to see much more water leave the bottle than entered it. Ask students to use these observations when generating ideas regard-ing the possible contents of the container. Provide students with overhead transparen- cies and pens, and instruct them to draw diagrams of what they think may be in bottle. Ask for vol-unteers to explain their hypotheses using the over-head projector. Encourage the participation of all students, and allow them to build on the ideas of others. After the nal presentation, discuss each idea to see if it explains all of the observed phenom-enon (e.g., increase in amount of fl uid, change in color). Keeping the bottle covered, pour an equal quantity of red water as before into the container. The students will note that nothing comes out of the container. Ask them to evaluate their hypoth-eses to see if they can explain these new data. The class should be able to rule out many of the hypotheses on the basis of the observations that they have made. After completing this process, ask students to vote on the hypothesis that they believe best explains the observations. Commend students for their contributions and critiques, and discuss how scientists use similar processes to gen-erate a variety of hypotheses before focusing in on one to be tested. Although the primary purpose of this activity is to engage students in brainstorming and hypoth-esis generation, students will undoubtedly want to Figure 5.9 Setup for the Mysterious Bottle Activity A Bcut D250 ml 150 50200 100 red blue PM 5/9/08 5:55:22 PM90 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science see the contents of the bottle to determine if their hypotheses were correct. Remove the aluminum foil, and show the simple siphon (Figure 5.10 ). The action of the siphon is dependent on differ-ences in gravitational attraction on the fl uid in the two arms of the siphon. There is greater pull on the side of the tube with a higher vertical column of water (in this case, the tube exiting the bottle) than there is on the shorter branch (the section inside the bottle). Water exhibits signi cant cohe- sive forces that prevent the column of water from breaking. As water starts to fl ow out the exit tube, water is pulled in through the inlet. The column of water \" falls \" toward the lowest point in much the way that a short section of rope placed over a railing falls to the side on which more of the rope hangs. For a siphon to function, there must be a dif- ference in pressure at the two ends of the tubing. In the siphon in this activity, the atmospheric pressure is approximately the same at both ends of the tube, but the liquid pressure is different. Liquid pressure can be calculated by multiplying the density of the fl uid ( /H9267 /H11005 1 g/cm 3 for water) by the acceleration due to gravity ( g /H11005 9.8 m/s 2 ) by the height differential ( h ). Thus, a 20 cm col- umn in the intake arm exerts a pressure of approx-imately 2 kPa (2000 N/m 2 ) while a 30 cm column of water in the exit tube exerts (not to scale shown in diagram) a pressure of approximately 3 kPa (3000 N/m 2 ). Fluid )9.8m3=/H9267= )9.8m s3 2=/H9267= (0.3m) kPa 3 Thus, pressure in the intake arm is 99 kPa (101 kPa of air pressure /H11002 2 kPa of water pressure) while pressure in the lower (exit) arm is only 98 kPa (101 kPa of air pressure /H11002 3 kPa of water pres- sure). Since the net pressure in the intake arm is greater than in the exit arm, water fl ows toward the exit. The greater the difference in height, the greater the pressure differential, and the greater the rate of fl ow. This activity provides a great model for \" black - box \" research. Researchers are often unable to see the thing that they are studying and must rely on observations of inputs and outputs. In this activ-ity, the addition of water is an input, and the water exiting is an output. Scientists draw inferences based on inputs and outputs, especially when they cannot see the inner workings. 5.5 Experimental Design Assume that you sit on the council of a major city, and the re commissioner comes to request more funding to hire additional re ghters. In the course of the presentation, the commis-sioner presents the data as shown in Figure 5.11A . PYREX1000 500 PYREX1000 Scienti c Methods 91 On the basis of these data, would you vote to hire more re ghters? I hope not! The graph suggests that the numbers of res in your city are propor- tional to the number of re ghters. Note that the number of re ghters is plotted on the x - axis, while the number of res is plotted on the y - axis. By convention, we plot the independent variable (the variable that we change independently of the other) on the x - axis, while plotting the dependent variable (the variable that changes in response to the independent variable) on the y - axis. The data in Figure 5.11A suggest that if you hire more re- ghters (the independent variable), your city will experience more res (dependent variable). As a city council member, you would probably not be reelected if your constituency learned that you voted in favor of the re commissioner ' s request on the basis of these data! If, however, the com-missioner presented the data as shown in Figure 5.11B , your vote would not provoke concern. These data suggest that as the number of res (the independent variable on the x - axis) has grown, the city has hired more re ghters (the depend- ent variable on the y - axis). As you can see, much confusion can be gen- erated by not following the standard convention for plotting data. By convention, the independent variable should be plotted on the x - axis (horizon- tal axis) and the dependent variable on the y - axis (vertical axis): Independent variable: Mathematicians tradi- tionally refer to the horizontal axis of a graph as the x - axis or the abscissa ; scientists refer to it as the independent variable. An independent variable is one that is unaffected by changes in the depend-ent variable. For example, when the infl uence of temperature on photosynthesis is examined, tem-perature is the independent variable because it does not depend on photosynthetic rate. A change in the photosynthetic rate does not affect the tem-perature of the air! Experimenters often manipu-late independent variables and look for changes in dependent variables in order to understand basic relationships. Dependent variable: Mathematicians refer to the vertical axis of the graph as the y - axis or ordinate, and scientists refer to it as the dependent variable. The dependent variable is dependent on changes in the independent variable. For example, photosynthesis is dependent on temperature. A change in air temperature will result in a change in photosynthetic production. Constants: T o conduct an experiment, it is necessary to keep factors other than the inde-pendent variable constant. For example, if a food scientist is studying the relationship between the concentration of preservative and the growth rate of bread mold, it is important that the tem-perature, humidity, light, and other factors be the same for all bread used in the study. If these are not kept constant, it is impossible to determine the effect of the variable that you are intending to test. Controls: Experiments also require a control, that is, a specimen that is not subjected to the pro-cedures affecting the rest of the experiment, thus acting as the standard against which the results are compared. ACTIVITY 5.5.1 Interpreting Graphs Figures 5.12A to 5.12H show the data from a vari-ety of experiments and studies. For each graph, (1) identify the independent variable, (2) identify the dependent variable, (3) list factors that must be held constant, (4) describe an experiment that would produce such data, and (5) give a simple interpretation of the data. firefighters firesfires firefi ghtersAB Figure 5.11 Relationship of Fires and The Sourcebook for Teaching Science 5.6 Independent Variables In 1976, the United States celebrated its two - hun- dredth anniversary, and many people fl ocked to Philadelphia to celebrate and commemorate the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Shortly after the celebrations, 180 people who had attended the American Legion Convention in Philadelphia contracted pneumonia - like symptoms, and 34 eventually died from related complications. \" Legionnaires ' disease, \" as it was called, pro mpted a massive medical investigation. Researchers knew that all who had suffered from Legionnaires ' dis-ease had attended the American Legion convention, but beyond that, they did not have much informa-tion. Was the disease caused by an environmental toxin, a virus, bacteria, or other pathogen? Was it transmitted by food, water, air, or direct contact? To nd the cause, medical researchers isolated and studied single variables and then studied these in conjunction with others. After much methodical research, scientists were successful in identifying the disease agent (the bacteria Legionella pneu- mophila ) and the environmental parameters (mists containing the bacteria) that set the stage for this deadly outbreak. As with Legionnaires ' disease, most other real - life problems are complex and contain many vari-ables, each of which may infl uence the outcome individually or in conjunction with other varia- bles. In Activity 5.6.1, you will be confronted with a complex situation in which many things happen simultaneously, and you must use a methodical approach of isolating variables to determine the causes of the phenomena you see. ACTIVITY 5.6.1 Isolating Variables in a Complex Chemical Reaction Materials: resealable sandwich bags, plastic spoons, plastic beral pipettes, anhydrous calcium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, phenol gram solid phenol red/liter of solution), beakers Put on a laboratory coat and protective eye- wear. Place 5 g (approximately 1 teaspoon) of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 ) in one corner of a plastic bag with a zipper lock and an equal amount of anhydrous calcium chloride in another. Be careful not to mix the powders. Place a plas-tic beral pipette lled with phenol red solution (made by dissolving 0.1 g of phenol red powder in 100 mL of water) in the bag with the tip posi-tioned so no solution leaks into the powder. Seal the bag, and mix all the components as rapidly as possible. Once the contents are thoroughly mixed, set the bag on a table, and record any changes (such as color, temperature, and appearance) you observe in Table 5.2 . height of plants (cm) acidity of water (pH) ozone molecules destroyed per CFC molecule altitude percent with emphysema cigarettes smoked per day hydrocarbon concentration in exhaust when new year of production (same model of car)photosynthetic rate wavelength of light photosynthetic rate carbon dioxide concentration current voltage number of bird species height of tree forestAC EB FGD H Figure 5.12 Graphs of Experimental 92 5/9/08 5:55:26 PM 5/9/08 5:55:26 PMEmploying Scienti c Methods 93 Although a variety of changes occur when the phenol red, sodium bicarbonate, and calcium chloride are mixed, it is not possible to deter-mine the speci c causes of each change because there are too many variables. For example, is the observed color change due to the mixing of phenol red solution with sodium bicarbonate, the mixing of phenol red solution with calcium chloride, the mixing of sodium bicarbonate and calcium chloride, or the mixing of all three items? T o answer such questions, it is necessary to change one variable at a time while controlling, or keeping constant, the rest. For example, rather than mixing all three substances together at once, try mixing small quantities of pairs of chemi-cals independently in small beakers and then mixing the resulting mixtures with the remaining substance. Mix phenol red and sodium bicarbonate, and report your observations in Table 5.2 . Mix phenol red and calcium chloride in a separate bag, and record your observations. Finally, mix sodium bicarbonate and calcium chloride without any phenol red, and again record your observations. Repeat the original process, but starting with a mixture of two substances as shown in Table 5.3 . Record your observations in the appropriate col-umns, and then add the nal substance to each mixture as speci ed in the table. Answer the fol- lowing questions. 1. Which combination is necessary for the for- mation of a precipitate? 2. Which combination(s) (the temperature drops)? 4. Is a precipitate formed as a result of mixing two powders, a powder and phenol red, or the two solutions?

Explain your answer. 5.7 Writing Clear Procedures In September 1999, the Mars Global Surveyor, a $ 125 million NASA spacecraft, disappeared as it was about to enter orbit around the red planet. When an investigation was performed, it was learned that Lockheed Martin Corporation, the company that built the spacecraft, had pro-grammed it using pounds of thrust, a custom-ary or English system of measuring force, while the navigators at Jet Propulsion Laboratory were assuming it was programmed in newtons, a met-ric unit of measuring thrust. This major loss high-lighted the need of scientists and engineers to communicate in clear and unambiguous terms. The following activities help students learn the difference between ambiguous and unambiguous procedures and observations. ACTIVITY 5.7.1 Assembling a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich T ell your students to write instructions for the construction of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Collect their papers, and select a few for illustra-tion. Read their instructions, and follow them in a manner consistent with the writing, not necessar-ily with the intent of the author. For example: Student instruction: Place a dinner plate on a fl at table surface. Your response: Place the plate upside down on the table. Student instruction: Take two pieces of bread from the loaf. Your response: Grab two pieces of bread through the wall of the bag. Student instruction: Put peanut butter on the bread. Your response: Place the unopened container of peanut butter on the slice of bread. Student instruction: Spread the peanut butter on the bread with the knife. Your response: Hold the blade and spread the peanut butter with the handle. Student instruction: Spread jelly on the other slice of bread. Your response: Spread jelly on the crust of the other slice. Student instruction: Place the two pieces of bread together. Your response: Place the two pieces together, but with the peanut butter and jelly on the outsides. Use this humorous activity to illustrate the importance of writing instructions or recording observations in a precise and unambiguous man-ner. Y ou may wish to share the following set of more precise procedures with your students: 1. Place a plate on a table with the concave side facing up. 2. Gently hold a loaf of bread on the table with your nondominant hand. 3. Using your dominant hand, twist the tie - wire counterclockwise until it is completely unwound. 4. Using your dominant hand, remove the tie, and place it on the table. 5. Using your dominant hand, remove the sec- ond and third slices of bread from the sack through the opening. 6. Lay both pieces of bread fl at on the plate. 7. Grasp the jar of peanut butter with your non- dominant hand. 8. Place the palm of your nondominant hand on the side of an unopened jar. 9. Grasp the lid of the jar with your dominant hand, and twist the cap in a counterclockwise direction until the jar opens, and set the cap down on the table. 10. Release your dominant hand, and use it to grasp the handle of the knife and dip the blade into the peanut butter, scooping out approximately 2 tablespoons of peanut butter. 5/9/08 5:55:27 PMEmploying Scienti c Methods 95 11. Spread the peanut butter that is now on the knife blade as evenly as possible onto the upper surface of one slice of bread. 12. Repeat steps 7 to 11, substituting jelly for pea- nut butter and applying jelly to the exposed face of the second slice of bread. 13. Place the faces of the bread together with the peanut butter and jelly sides in the middle. ACTIVITY 5.7.2 Writing Unambiguous Procedures Pierre Fermat (1601 - 1665) was one of the most famous number theorists who ever lived, but unfor-tunately he was not a great communicator and published only one mathematical paper in his entire life. One of Fermat ' s most famous unpublished works is known as Fermat ' s Last Theorem. It states that x n /H11001 y n = z n has no nonzero integer solutions for x, y, and z when n > 2. Fermat wrote, \" I have discovered a truly remarkable proof which this margin is too small to contain. \" But he never documented his proof, and for centuries mathematicians have been seeking to rediscover it. Scientists, like math-ematicians, need to document their work and share it with others. They need to clearly explain their observations, experimental procedures, and ndings. In this activity you will repeat the process in the preceding activity, although you will be writ-ing instructions for one of the following: (1) putting on a jacket, (2) shuffl ing a deck of cards, or (3) drawing a map to your home. Y our direc-tions should be unambiguous so that they can be followed without any assumptions. 5.8 Using History to Teach Scienti c Methods Isaac Newton, one of the most infl uential physi- cists of all time, said: \" If I have seen farther than other men, it is because I have stood upon the shoulders of giants. \" Newton, like all other sci-entists, did not make his discoveries in a vacuum but relied heavily on the methodologies, data, and conclusions of others who had gone before him. Although educators often do a good job intro- ducing their students to the conclusions of scientists, most do not take time to introduce the methodolo-gies and thought processes that lead to these con-clusions. Unfortunately this may lead students to believe that science is merely a set of conclusions rather than a vital endeavor of discovery. An apprentice electrician learns the trade not by merely analyzing wiring diagrams or nished circuits but by watching and imitating the proce-dures practiced by a master electrician. In a simi-lar manner, a surgical intern learns surgery not by looking at the results of a successful surgery but by accompanying an experienced surgeon through diagnostic and surgical procedures. T o learn science, students need to observe not only the conclusions of scienti c research but also the processes that lead to these conclusions. In the activities that follow, stu-dents are led through historical accounts of major discoveries and must learn to ask and answer appro- priate questions the way the original scientists did. ACTIVITY 5.8.1 Tracking Down the Cause of Beriberi Disease I suggest that the teacher read the narrations and questions and ask for student responses. The ques-tions are designed to refl ect those raised by the original researchers. Narration 1: The Republic of Indonesia en- compasses the world ' s largest archipelago, a chain of islands on the equator north of Australia, stretching one - eighth of the earth ' s circumference. Indonesia is the fth most populated country in the world and was the largest Dutch colony before it gained its independence in 1949. In 1602 (eight-een years before the Mayfl ower sailed to America), Dutch merchants formed the Dutch East Indies Company to protect a lucrative trade that they had established with the people of those islands. The Dutch who came to live or trade in the Indonesian archipelago soon learned of numerous diseases never seen in their native Holland. One of the most famous diseases was beriberi, an often fatal con-dition marked by extreme weakness. The Dutch c05.indd 95 5/9/08 5:55:28 PM 5/9/08 Sourcebook for Teaching Science wanted to nd the cause of this dreaded disease so they might also be able to nd a cure. By the mid - nineteenth century, French scien- tist Louis Pasteur had demonstrated that fermen-tation (the production of alcohol in aging plant material) and putrefaction (the rotting of food) were caused by microscopic organisms in the air. The work of Pasteur and others led to the estab-lishment of germ theory, which suggests that many diseases are caused by microorganisms. The Dutch East Indies Company was aware of Pasteur ' s work and commissioned a team of scientists to go to the archipelago to identify the germ causing beriberi. Assume that you were one of the researchers on this team as you address the following questions. Question: What is the research question that must be answered? Note to teacher : Research begins with a research question or problem. Just as a golfer needs to see the fl ag of the next hole before teeing off, a researcher needs to develop a research question before initiat-ing research. In projects like this, students often raise questions that are too speci c. For example, their rst question might be, \" Is beriberi caused by mos- quito bites? \" or \" Is it transmitted through the water? \" Guide your students to ask more general questions so they can gather suf cient data to proceed. Possible Student Responses What is the germ that causes beriberi? What is the cause of beriberi? Narration 2: In the late 1800s, the Dutch research team arrived in Java, the most heavily populated island of the Indonesian archipelago. Before the team could nd the germ responsible for beriberi, it was rst necessary to collect more data and make more observations. Question: What additional observations would you need to make if you were a member of this research team? Possible Student Responses What are the symptoms of beriberi? What are the characteristics of those who have beriberi and the characteristics of those who do not have beriberi? Where is beriberi most common? Is beriberi correlated with any environmental conditions such as water supply, sanitation, light, or something else? Narration 3: The Dutch researchers noticed that beriberi is accompanied by muscle weakness, weight loss, nervous disorders, and ultimately paralysis and death. They found that beriberi was common on Java, the heavily populated island that was the seat of the colonial government. They looked for correlations between beriberi and vari-ous environmental factors (sanitation, water qual-ity, air quality, light intensity, and others) but found none. Question: The research team was commis- sioned to nd the germ that caused beriberi. What would you do try to nd the germ? Note to teacher: Students should see the need for a control in both observation and experimen-tation. For example, it is not suf cient to look at the body fl uids of sick people alone, because there is no basis of comparison and no way of con-cluding if something is abnormal unless you rst establish what \" normal \" is. Possible Student Responses Compare the body fl uids and tissues of healthy people with those who have beriberi. Examine under a microscope the saliva, blood, and urine of diseased patients. Narration 4: Using microscopes, the research team observed the blood, urine, and saliva of dis-eased individuals but found no germs. Finally, after nine months, they left their youngest member, Christiaan Eijkman, in charge of the tiny research station and went home to Holland. Eijkman con-tinued his research for 10 years. Question: If you were Christiaan Eijkman, what would your next step be? Note to teacher: Students often think that if an experiment does not go as planned, it is a fail-ure. Thomas Edison, perhaps the world ' s greatest inventor, had numerous \" failed experiments \" in his efforts to invent a light bulb, but said, \" I have not failed. I just found 10,000 ways that won ' t work. \" c05.indd 96 c05.indd 96 5/9/08 5:55:28 PM 5/9/08 5:55:28 PMEmploying Scienti c Methods 97 Edison did not view negative results with distain and said, \" I am not discouraged, because every wrong attempt discarded is another step forward. \" Possible Student Responses Collect more data. Make more observations. Determine if there are other organisms that demonstrate beriberi characteristics. Narration 5: Eijkman continued to collect more data on the characteristics of beriberi and those who had it. While working at the research station, Eijkman noticed that some of the chick-ens living at the research station contracted beri-beri - like symptoms. Many of the chickens were sick for several months, and some died, while oth-ers recovered. Eijkman tried to correlate the onset of the sickness with environmental variables and noticed that the chickens got sick only after a ship-ment of their red rice failed to arrive, and they were fed higher - grade polished white rice instead. (In nature, rice is covered by a red or brown husk. Polishing removes the husk and allows rice to be stored much longer with a lesser risk of spoilage.) When the superintendent of the research station noticed that they were being fed polished white rice, he reordered a shipment of unhusked red rice to reduce his costs. Eijkman noticed that the health of the chickens recovered after they were fed the unhusked rice. Most people would have shrugged off this observation, but Eijkman rec-ognized its signi cance. As Thomas Edison said, \" The eye sees a great many things, but the average brain records very few of them. \" Eijkman did not have an \" average brain. \" Question: What could cause the chickens to recover when fed the brown rice? Possible Student Responses There may have been a germ in the white rice that was causing the sickness, and this germ was not present in the red rice. Perhaps beriberi is not caused by a germ but by a lack of something that exists in unhusked rice. Narration 6: Eijkman was not certain that the symptoms exhibited by the sick chickens were due to beriberi but decided to investigate further. He noticed that chickens at the research station sur-vived almost entirely on a diet of rice and deter-mined to see if there might be a link between diet and the disease. Eijkman examined health reports from Indonesian prisons and noticed that beriberi was reported in 34 of 63 prisons where polished rice was served, but was rarely reported among 27 other prisons where red, unhusked rice was served. The prisoners, like the chickens at his research sta-tion, survived on a diet consisting almost entirely of rice. Question: What can you hypothesize about the possible cause of beriberi? Possible Student Responses There is a poison in rice that is countered by an antidote in the husk. Beriberi is not caused by a germ or a poi-son, but rather by the lack of some substance found in unhusked rice. Narration 7: Eijkman hypothesized that beri- beri was not caused by germs but rather by toxins in the polished rice that were checked by antidote substances in the unhusked rice. He designed an experiment to nd the toxin. Question: How would you design an experi- ment to nd a toxin in the white rice? Note to the teacher: Students should mention two treatments: one with the presumed toxin, and one without it ( control ). Emphasize the need for controls when designing an experiment. Without a control, it is impossible to interpret the results. Emphasize that it is necessary to change only one variable at time. If two or three potential toxins are tested at a time, it will be unclear which one has caused the problem. Possible Student Response Separate the components of rice, and feed each to a different group of chickens. Narration 8: In his experiment, Eijkman separated healthy chickens into three groups and fed one group only whole grain rice, a second group only rice with the husk removed, and a c05.indd 97 c05.indd 97 5/9/08 5:55:29 PM 5/9/08 5:55:29 PM98 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science third group only rice from which both the outer husk and the inner silver skin membrane were removed. Table 5.4 shows the results of his study. Question : What can you conclude from Eijkman ' s data? Possible Student Response Beriberi is not caused by a germ or toxin but by the absence of something found in the silver skin. Narration 9: Eijkman ' s research indicated that there is a vital substance in the pericarpium (silver skin) of rice that prevents the onset of beriberi. Later this substance became known as a \" vital - amine, \" or vitamin. Although the speci c chemical was not yet identi ed, the concept of vitamins was introduced for the rst time. The inspector - general of public health in the Dutch East Indies ordered that all prisoners receive unhusked rice, and within a very short time beriberi disappeared from the prison system. It was later shown that this same vital substance could be found in bar-ley, prompting the Japanese navy to include barley with polished rice in the food given to sailors, thereby eliminating beriberi from their navy. Eijkman originally set out to nd the germ responsible for beriberi but instead discovered that the disease was caused by the absence of a \" vital substance \" (vitamin). In 1929, Christiaan Eijkman was awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine for the discovery of vitamins, a group of organic substances essential in small quantities for animal nutrition and metabolism. Y ears later, Casimir Funk, a Polish emigrant to the United States, identi ed Eijkman ' s vital material as thia- mine, or vitamin B 1 . Eijkman ' s research can be used to help us understand other historical occurrences as well. As early as the fth century b.c., Hippocrates described a condition now known as scurvy, characterized by bleeding gums, hemorrhag-ing, and death. Scurvy became a dreaded disease among all who embarked on long voyages. On one of Christopher Columbus ' s voyages, some Portuguese sailors developed scurvy and requested to be dropped off on one of the newly discovered islands so they could die on land rather than at sea. On a later voyage, Columbus returned to the island and found the men alive and healthy, and named the island Cura \u00e7 ao, meaning \" cure. \" In the middle of the eighteenth century, the Scottish physician James Lind noted that sailors given a diet rich in citrus fruit rapidly recovered from the dreaded scourge. In response to Lind ' s work, the British navy soon required crews to carry citrus such as lime on all voyages, and the British sailors thus acquired the nickname limeys. Question: Is there any relationship between these cures for scurvy and the cure that Eijkman found for beriberi? Possible Student Response Y es. Scurvy, like beriberi, is due to a vitamin de ciency (lack of vitamin C). Prior to refrig- eration, sailors survived on diets consisting of sh, salted meats, and hardtack, but no vitamin - rich fruits or vegetables. Columbus ' s abandoned crew members were able to eat vitamin - rich fruits on Cura \u00e7 ao, prompting their recovery from scurvy. In a similar man-ner, James Lind ' s patients recovered because of the vitamin C in their citrus - rich diets.

These are but of few of the many instances in which scientists must draw conclusions on the basis of indirect evidence. Experiments in which the researcher can neither see nor measure the object of interest are referred to as \" black box \" experiments. In such instances, researchers must make inferences from inputs, outputs, and other indirect evidence. ACTIVITY 5.9.1 Determining the Contents of a \" Black Box \" Materials: shoe boxes, duct tape, adhesive (panel adhesive, hot glue, etc.), 2\" 3 2 \" board and saw or children ' s blocks, marble Teacher preparation : Ask students to bring shoeboxes to class. Using a wood saw, cut 2 in. lengths from a 2\" /H11003 2 \" board (available at most hardware or home improvement stores). Using paneling adhesive, hot glue, or similar adhesive, position the blocks in the base of each box accord-ing to the plans shown in Figure 5.14A . Place one marble or ball bearing in each box, and seal the box with duct tape. Mark the design pattern on the lid using a code so students will not know the design but you will be able to check without open-ing the box. Alternatively, students can prepare these boxes by gluing children ' s building blocks or other similar objects to the fl oors of the boxes. Distribute one box to each lab group. Student participation: Determine the inter- nal structure of your box by evidence (sound or vibrations, for example) produced by the mov-ing marble.

Most of us accept such diagrams without asking how we know what the core of the earth looks like because no one has ever been there, or how we can diagram the structure of an atom if it is too small to be seen, or how we can determine our position in the Milky Way if it is impossible to c05.indd 99 c05.indd 99 5/9/08 5:55:30 PM 5/9/08 5:55:30 PM100 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science as long as it does not damage the box or break the seal (Figure 5.14B ). Draw a diagram indicating where you believe the blocks are located. Compare your diagram with the correct one as recorded by your teacher. Were you able to determine the positions of the hidden blocks? If so, you did so on the basis of indirect evidence because you never opened the box. ACTIVITY 5.9.2 Determining the Structure of the Atom with Indirect Evidence Materials: Pegboard, dowels, marbles, graph paper, and rulers. In 1897, the English physicist Joseph John Thomson con rmed the existence of the electron, a fundamental particle of matter with a negative charge. Thomson believed that an atom was a uni-form sphere of positive matter in which negative electrons were embedded, somewhat like raisins in a bowl of pudding (Figure 5.15A ). In his model, the positive and negative charges were evenly dis-tributed in space. Consequently a particle with positive charge traveling through the space occu-pied by the negative and positive charges would be traveling through a \" neutral zone \" because the effects of the positive and negative charges would cancel and the particle would experience no unbalanced force to move it one way or another. In other words, a positive particle would move straight through the \" plum pudding \" model, expe-riencing no defl ection. In the early part of the twentieth century, English physicist Ernest Rutherford investigated the structure of the atom by shooting alpha par-ticles (positively charged helium ions; helium nuclei) through very thin foils of gold and other metals. Most of the incoming alpha particles passed through the foil either undefl ected or with only a slight defl ection, as would be predicted by the Thomson model. However, there were some startling occurrences in which the alpha parti-cles were defl ected at large angles and, at times, straight back in the direction from which they had come (Figure 5.15B ). Rutherford explained these results by proposing that the atom is mostly empty space (which explains why most of the alpha particles pass through undefl ected) with positive charges concentrated in a dense central core (which explains why positively charged alpha particles are occasionally defl ected or refl ected). Rutherford never saw an atom but inferred its structure by observing the interaction of alpha particles with atoms. Rutherford ' s classic black box experiments revolutionized our understand-ing of the atom. The following black box experi-ment imitates Rutherford ' s original experiment. Students are asked to determine the position of pegs ( \" nuclei \" ) in a hidden pegboard by studying their interaction with marbles ( \" alpha particles \" ). Students should work in pairs for this activity. Obtain three pegs and a pegboard that has at least 2 holes on a side (minimum of 25 holes per board, approximately 3 cm apart). Wooden pegs may be made by cutting and sanding dowels that have a diameter similar to the holes in the pegboard. The pegs should be long enough that marbles can freely move under the apparatus when set up as shown in Figure 5.16A . While one student looks away, the other places three pegs randomly in pegboard holes and turns the board over, placing it so that the pegs are lying on a fl at surface and the board is parallel to the desk surface.

Without looking under the board to see the position of the pegs, the second student should now roll marbles under the pegboard at selected intervals and record on the graph paper the original path of the marble and any result-ing defl ections. T o ensure that marbles travel straight, they should be launched between two straight edges (Figure 5.16B ). This activity should be repeated for at least two adjacent sides of the pegboard. If the ball is defl ected, it indicates that there is a peg in that row or column. Analyze the results to identify the positions of the pegs. Repeat the procedure until you can accurately determine and record the positions of all three pegs. 5.10 Evaluating Hypotheses Perhaps the most prodigious inventor of all time was Thomas Alva Edison, holder of 1093 patents and inventor of the rst reliable electric light bulb (Figure 5.17 ), movie camera, and sound record-ing device (phonograph). Although the public remembers Edison for his numerous inventions that revolutionized the way we live and work, scientists remember him primarily for the devel-opment of the rst industrial research laboratory. Edison assembled a wide array of chemists, physicists, inventors, machinists, botanists, mate-rials experts, and other professionals from around the world to work at his laboratories in Menlo Park and East Orange, New Jersey. In Edison ' s lab-oratories, everyone had to be a team player. Edison and his research associates set research agendas, determined job descriptions, worked together toward common goals, and in a short time intro-duced the world to a dazzling array of useful inventions. T oday Edison ' s model is used world-wide as engineers and scientists work together with common objectives. The power of scienti c teamwork was profoundly illustrated when NASA ' s (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) team of engineers and scientists landed men on the Moon, and when a nationwide team of biolo-gists announced the sequencing of the human genome. The activity that follows illustrates the value of teamwork and the need to reevaluate hypotheses in light of new data. ACTIVITY 5.19.1 Tangrams and Team-work Teacher preparation: This activity must be pre- pared in advance by the teacher. Download the tangram sheet from the sourcebook Web site ( sciencesourcebook.com ) or make your own using the scale diagram in Figure 5.18 , making cer-tain each piece is labeled appropriately. Cut the shapes as shown and make a set of ve envelopes for each team as follows: (a) I,E,H; (b) A,A,A,C; (c) A,J; (d) D,F; (e) B,C,F,G.

Separate students into teams of ve, and read the following instructions. Each team member gets one of the envelopes. Each team must assemble ve separate squares from the pieces provided. Each team member must construct a square. Y ou cannot work on others ' squares. Y ou may not talk or make gestures. Y ou cannot take any pieces from another stu-dent; you can only give pieces. Then ask these questions: 1. What does this teach about scienti c teamwork? 2. What does this teach about the scienti c method? Note to teacher: Although a variety of squares can be made from the pieces of paper provided, not all are part of the nal ve - square solution. Therefore, if one student constructs a square that is not part of the solution and is unwilling to break his or her square and distribute the pieces to team mates, the team can never construct all ve squares. Participants must keep their attention on the group goal of constructing all ve squares and be willing to give up their own work to achieve the nal team goal. This exercise is an excellent tool in teaching teamwork, a necessary element in any modern research laboratory. Students must look at the needs of the group, not just their own needs, if their team is to be successful in achieving the nal goal. They must pay careful attention to the needs of others and be willing to disassemble their own squares to provide pieces needed by others. This exercise is also an excellent way to introduce the need to maintain fl exibility when developing hypotheses. Although a hypothesis may appear to explain experimental results, it may have to be replaced by a different hypothesis that is more consistent with the data. Students who are unwilling to disassemble their own \" hypotheses \" (in this case, the squares they have made) will be unable to reach a nal conclusion. Answers to Chapter Activities 5.1.1 - 5.1.3 The activities in this section are designed to develop a need to know. Although this is dif cult to quantify, the teacher will know when it has occurred by student attitudes and the questions they raise 5.2.1 This activity has been used throughout the years to encourage students to make careful and comprehen-sive observations. By observing both the unlit and the burning candle, students can see the infl uence of the fl ame. Table 5.1 is a partial list of the types of observa- tions that can be made. Y ou may wish to award points on the quantity of observations, detracting points for statements that are not observations (inferences, inac-curate observations, irrelevant comments.) 5.2.2 Students should generate a wide variety of questions. The following information may help you prepare for such questions. The cotton wicks of some new candles are dipped in paraf n, while others are not. If there is no paraf n in the wick, it will burn rather rapidly until the heat from the fl ame starts to melt the paraf- n below it. The wick is a string, and liquid paraf n is drawn up it and into the fl ame by capillary action. The light and heat produced by the combustion of the wick are insigni cant compared to the light and heat produced by the combustion of the paraf n. A thin candle will burn much more rapidly than a thick can-dle because it runs out of fuel more quickly. Similarly, a candle will burn down much more rapidly if the 14 cm 7 cm14 cm 7 cm7 cm 7 cm14 cm 7 cmAAC CD EF FHG I J 234514 cm 7 cmA c Methods 103 melted paraf n is allowed to drain out of the reservoir away from the wick. Paraf n has a rather low melting point (53 C) and becomes a liquid as the fl ame approaches. Liquid par- af n fl ows into the well created by the fl ame and then moves up the wick by capillary action. As the liquid paraf n approaches the fl ame, it vaporizes. The fl ash point of paraf n is 198 C. When it reaches this tem- perature it combusts: 29 16 0 6 230 62 2 2 2CH O g C O g H O ( g ) + + () () Oxygen and paraf n are consumed, and carbon dioxide and water vapor are produced. The condensate that students observe forming on the sides of a cooled beaker placed over the candle is from the water formed during combustion. The carbon dioxide will dissolve into the bromthymol blue droplets placed on the fun-nel. Dissolved carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3 ): C O HO HC O23 22+ Bromthymol blue turns greenish as the pH drops due to the formation of carbonic acid. The combus-tion requires oxygen, and thus the fl ame will be extin- guished if all of the oxygen is consumed. The length of time that a candle will burn when placed under a beaker is directly proportional to the volume of the air trapped in the beaker. Thus, students should notice that the fl ame burns twice as long when placed under a 1000 mL beaker as when placed under a 500 mL beaker. Another common product of combustion is soot, a black powdery form of carbon that rises up in ne particles within the fl ames and smoke. Soot col- lects on glassware that is held immediately above the fl ame. Soot production is more rapid when there is less oxygen, and therefore students will notice the rate of soot deposition increases rapidly as oxygen is depleted when a beaker is lowered partially over the fl ame. Soot and unburned hydrocarbons are released in the smoke of the fl ame, making it possible to relight a candle by igniting the smoke. It is generally possible to relight a smoking candle from a distance of about 1 cm. 5.3.1 Observations may include only those things that are actually observed, such as color, shape, and height. Students should not make inferences, such as growth, root structure, or type of \" plant. \" 5.3.2 Observations may include only those things that are actually observed, such as color, appearance, shape, and movement. Students should not make inferences such as the nature of the raisidia, the composition of the liquid, or the composition of the bubbles. 5.4.1 It is likely that each group will derive a different rank- ing, and these differences can provide an interesting platform for discussion. During the discussion phase, make certain that each team provides a rationale for its rankings. Often different rankings are a result of dif-ferent assumptions. Encourage students to state their assumptions and discuss the logic of their responses given these assumptions. Table 5.5 lists potential ben-e ts of the items listed. 5.4.2 Students will explain their drawings using the overhead projector. 5.5.1 Graphing and experimental design: (a) (1) pH of water. (2) height of plants. (3) type of plant, age of seeds, temperature, light, soil, etc. (4) Seeds of the same plant were grown in containers that were given water of different pH. (5) The growth of this species is a function of the pH of the water it receives. When pH is too low or too high, growth is little, but when the pH is in an intermediate zone, growth is signi cant. (b) (1) altitude. (2) molecules of ozone destroyed per CFC molecule. (3) source of air, ozone concentration, tem-perature, light intensity, etc. (4) A series of chambers is established with atmospheric conditions of differ-ing altitudes. An equal amount of chlorofl uorocarbon (CFC) is introduced into each, and the level of ozone is measured after a given time. (5) CFCs are stable mol-ecules that served as coolants in air - conditioning units and propellants in aerosol cans. Although CFCs do not interact with ozone at lower elevations, they cause sig-ni cant degradation at higher elevations. Since ozone protects us by ltering ultraviolet light, such research has led many countries to ban various uses of CFCs. (c) (1) voltage. (2) current. (3) resistance, circuit design, etc. (4) The current in a circuit is measured as you increase the voltage. (5) An increase in voltage causes an increase in current. Physicists know this relation-ship as Ohm ' s law, V = IR. (d) (1) year car was manufactured. (2) the concentration of hydrocarbons in the exhaust. (3) make and model of car, manner in which exhaust is measured, etc. (4) The exhaust of new cars is analyzed as the cars roll off the production lines. The average hydrocarbon exhaust data for each production year are plotted. (5) Each year the automobile manufacturer in this study produces cars with lower hydrocarbon emissions. (e) (1) wavelength of light. (2) rate of photosynthesis. (3) temperature, type of plant, way in which photosynthe-sis is measured, etc. (4) Plants are grown in a growth chamber with all conditions being similar except the wavelength of light to which they are exposed. (5) Plants grow fastest in relatively short and long wave-length light, and slower in mid - wavelength light. (f) (1) carbon dioxide concentration. (2) rate of photo- synthesis. (3) type of light, temperature, humidity, soil moisture, etc. (4) Plants are grown in controlled chambers of differing carbon dioxide concentration. (5) At low and mid - carbon dioxide concentrations, an increase in the carbon dioxide concentration results in an increased rate of photosynthesis, but at high carbon dioxide concentrations, the rate changes little. c05.indd 103 c05.indd 103 5/9/08 5:55:34 PM 5/9/08 5:55:34 PM104 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Table 5.5 Possible Uses of Items While on the Surface of the Moon Two 100 kg tanks of oxygen Oxygen is necessary for respiration. Humans can survive only about 5 minutes without oxygen. 10 L of water Water is necessary for all biological processes. Without water, humans can survive only about 5 to 9 days. Stellar map A stellar map can be used to orient oneself for the journey to the research station. 10 kg dehydrated food Food is required for energy for the long trek, but some students will note that it will be impossible to eat food unless it can be delivered to the mouth without breaking the seal of the astronaut's suit. Some students may rank this item low, supposing that there will be no way to prepare it outside the pressurized environment of the space capsule. Solar-powered FM two-way radioThe FM radio can be used to transmit a distress signal to the research station. FM radios, however, transmit only by line of sight, which will be more dif cult to obtain on the moon given the greater curvature of the moon's surface. The lack of an atmosphere should not hamper FM transmission because FM signals do not refl ect off the ionosphere (which does not exist on the moon) as do AM signals. 50 m of nylon rope Rope may be useful for climbing or tying things together.First aid kit The rst aid kit will be of value only if it is designed to be used with space suits. Conventional rst aid kits will be useless since astronauts will not be able to open their suits to apply any rst aid. Parachute silk Due to the lack of atmosphere, the solar radiation on the lighted side of the moon is very intense, and the silk can provide a good shelter from the solar rays. Life raft Life rafts often contain compressed carbon dioxide, which may have use as a propellant. The raft can be used to carry other items. Traditional signal fl ares Signal fl ares can be used to make distress signals. Flares produce their own oxygen and may therefore work in the atmosphere-free environment of the moon. Two 0.45 caliber pistols Some students will argue that these can be used for self-propulsion, but they would be of very limited value. Oxygen is released from the chemicals in the gunpowder, allowing the pistols to work on the surface of the moon. Case of dehydrated milk This could provide some nutrition if there is a way to mix it and ingest it in the absence of atmospheric pressure. Portable heating unit Most portable heating units emit infrared radiation, but unfortunately most of this heat would probably refl ect off the surfaces of the space suits and therefore have little effect on keeping the astronauts warm. Magnetic compass There are no magnetic poles on the moon, so a magnetic compass would be useless. Box of matches Matches require oxygen to burn, and therefore would be useless in the oxygen-free environment of the moon. c05.indd PM c Methods 105 (g) (1) number of cigarettes smoked per day. (2) percentage of population with emphysema. (3) This is a study rather than an experiment. Since it is unethical to perform such experiments on humans, one can collect human data only by examining statistics from the population. T o minimize the infl uence of other factors, one could study only individuals from the same gender, occupation, and age. (4) Conduct a survey in which you ask people how many cigarettes they smoke per day on average and whether they have emphysema. (5) Emphysema is a lung disorder in which there is a loss in the oxygen - absorbing air sacs known as alveoli. The data suggest that smoking causes emphysema.

(4) Identify the number of bird species found within given plot of land. Measure the average height of the forest canopy. Repeat these measurements for other regions within the forest. (5) As a forest matures and the canopy gets higher, it supports a greater diversity of bird species. 5.6.1 Phenol red solution is primarily water, and both cal- cium chloride and sodium bicarbonate dissolve within it. The dissolution of calcium chloride is an exothermic process and produces heat (temperature rises): H O Ca (aq) 2Cr (aq) hea22t2+ + The dissolution of sodium bicarbonate, however, is an endothermic process and consumes heat (tem-perature Na (aq) HCO The observed temperature changes are due pri- marily to the interaction of these two reactions. The calcium ions then react with the bicarbonate ions to produce a white precipitate (calcium carbonate), water, and carbon dioxide gas. Carbon dioxide is the gas that causes the plastic bag to expand. Calcium carbonate is the precipitate that settles in the bottom of the bag.

C O HO HC O22 2 3+ As a result of their research, students should be able to isolate the variables responsible for different phenomenon and answer the questions: (1) Calcium ions and bicar bonate ions react to produce calcium bicarbonate, a white precipitate. (2) The dissolution of calcium chloride in water is exothermic. (3) The dissolution of sodium bicarbonate in water is endothermic. (4) The precipitate (calcium carbonate) is formed by mix- ing two solutions (sodium bicarbonate and calcium chloride solutions). (5) Carbon dioxide is produced only when the two solu- tions are mixed. 5.7.1 After two or three tries, students should be able to write unambiguous instructions for assembling a pea-nut butter and jelly sandwich. 5.7.2 Students should be able to write unambiguous proce- dures for each of the activities. 5.8.1 This is an interactive discussion. No written response is required. 5.8.2 Students will write a history of one of these great dis- coveries, clearly identifying the (1) research question, (2) key observations, (3) hypotheses, (4) experiment, and (5) conclusions that were made. 5.9.1 After they make their observations, students should draw diagrams of the contents, including the positions and relative sizes of each object in the box, and then copy these diagrams to transparencies so they can be projected and discussed by the class. Students should explain the various techniques used in the developing their hypotheses. Some students may determine the center of gravity by balancing the box on their nger and then making inferences about the distribution of masses within. Other students may tilt the box gently back and forth and listen for when the marbles hit obstructions. Still others may shake, rotate, or slide the box to gather information. Following the discussion, you may wish to open the boxes to show students their internal design. 5.9.2 Students should correctly locate the position of the pegs ( \" nuclei \" ) on the graph paper by noting the rows and columns in which marbles ( \" alpha particles \" ) are defl ected or refl ected. 5.10.1 (1) This activity shows that researchers must work together to solve problems. When an individual is unwill-ing to share his or her information with others, the team goal cannot be achieved. Individuals should look at the needs of the team, and not just at their own needs. (2) The scienti c method is not linear. Often the researcher has to redesign experiments or reevaluate hypotheses in the light of new data. Researchers must be fl exible and willing to reassess their ideas in the light of empirical data. c05.indd 105 c05.indd 105 5/9/08 5:55:35 PM 5/9/08 5:55:35 PM106 Chapter Six Developing Scientif ic Reasoning Skills For the Teacher 106 6.1 Levels of Reasoning 108 6.2 Inductive Reasoning 111 6.3 Deductive Reasoning 116 6.4 Lateral Thinking 121 Answers to Chapter Activities 122 For the Teacher Although the goal of education is to develop thinkers and lifelong learners, few classroom activities encourage students to monitor or improve their own thinking and learning proc-esses. Metacognition, or thinking about and regu- lating one ' s own thought processes, is a skill that differentiates expert from novice learners. 1 E x p e r t learners employ effective learning techniques, monitor their own learning, and develop and adapt strategies to become more effective learn-ers. The activities in this chapter require students to think about their own thinking, with the goal of developing better metacognitive skills and becom-ing more effective learners. Novice learners rarely evaluate their com- prehension, examine the quality of their work, or make adjustments in their learning strategies. They are generally satis ed with super cial expla- nations and do not strive to make connections or understand the relevance of material learned. By contrast, expert learners think about their think-ing, know when they don ' t understand something, refl ect on the quality of their work, make revisions in learning strategies as they proceed, search for deeper explanations, and strive to understand how concepts are interrelated. Metacognition involves the development, imple- mentation, and evaluation of a learning plan. Dur ing development, learners establish goals (what needs to be learned and to what depth), determine relevant prior knowledge and skills, de ne task requirements (time, schedule, evalua- tion criteria), and select resources (books, peers, authorities, electronic references) that will assist them in reaching their goals. During implemen- tation, learners apply strategies (e.g., mnemonics, induction, deduction, concept mapping, outlin-ing, dimensional analysis, elaboration, pacing), evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies (using formative assessments including self - questioning, checklists, outlines, and notes), and modify their plans as necessary. As individuals become more skilled with metacognitive strategies, they gain con dence and become independent learners, determining and pursuing their own intellec-tual needs. PMDeveloping Scienti c Reasoning Skills 107 that most secondary instruction focuses on basic knowledge and comprehension and gives minimal attention to the development of higher - order rea-soning skills. Fortunately, the sciences provide an environment that is conducive to the development of these skills, and many teachers capitalize on this to help develop critical thinkers. Expert learners use metacognitive strategies to monitor and improve their learning, employ induc-tive and deductive logic to make discoveries, and exhibit knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation as they study and work. In addition, they demonstrate critical thinking, creativity, fl uency, fl exibility, originality, lateral thinking, transferability, and elaboration. Critical thinking is the process of analyzing and evaluating information on the basis of evidence and logic. Critical thinkers evaluate statements, opinions, and hypotheses by collecting, analyzing, and evaluating data, issues, and arguments from different sources and perspectives. Critical think-ing is the theme of Chapter Seven and is used to identify misconceptions in science. Creativity may involve insight, inventiveness, imagination, innovation, originality, initiative, and resourcefulness to develop new hypotheses, prod-ucts, or ways of thinking. It is dif cult to teach cre- ativity, but teachers can provide activities that help develop the requisite skills of fl uency (the ability to generate many ideas), fl exibility (the ability to see things from different perspectives), and elabora- tion (the ability to build on existing ideas. Fluent individuals generally consider many options and \" think outside the box. \" Brainstorming activi-ties, such as those introduced in Chapter Five, are helpful for accomplishing this. Flexible thinkers can analyze problems and issues from a variety of perspectives. This chapter provides lateral thinking exer- cises, designed to help students approach prob-lems from a variety of perspectives. Finally, much emphasis is given in this book (and in the com-panion books Hands - On Physics Activities with Applications and Hands - On Chemistry Activities with Real - Life Applications ) to transferability \u2014 the aptitude for applying ideas across a wide variety of contexts. 4 This chapter focuses on the identi cation and development of essential reasoning skills, and much of the rest of this book deals with speci c strategies. T eachers should implement learning activities that develop these skills and instruments that assess them. As students learn to identify and develop their reasoning skills, they become more effective and independent learners and better able to use the strategies introduced throughout this book. Inductive reasoning (drawing conclusions from the natural world through observation and experi-mentation) is a process of making generalizations from speci c information. By contrast, deductive reasoning (deriving testable predictions about spe- ci c cases from established principles) is a process of making speci c conclusions by the application of general principles. Scientists and others employ both in their work and everyday lives. In an effort to categorize reasoning and learn- ing skills, a committee of psychologists and edu-cators, directed by Benjamin Bloom, developed a taxonomy of affective, psychomotor, and cogni-tive skills. 2 The taxonomy of cognitive objectives ( knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation ) became widely used by edu- cators and curriculum developers (Figure 6.1A). Recently, experts have proposed modi cations (Figure 6.1B), but although I see merit in the revised classi cation, the activities in this book use the original format because of its familiarity and widespread acceptance in literature and practice. 3 Although designed as a hierarchy, the elements are not strictly hierarchical in practice, so the position within the hierarchy should not be overempha-sized. Bloom ' s taxonomy gives us the opportunity to examine our teaching emphasis, and it is noted knowledgecomprehensionapplicationanalysissynthesisevaluation rememberingunderstandingapplyinganalyzingevaluatingcreatingAB Figure 6.1 (A) Bloom ' s Taxonomy, 1956. (B) Revised Taxonomy, 2001 PM108 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science 6.1 Levels of Reasoning Any discussion of thought processes requires rst agreeing on terms and interpretations. Perhaps the most widely used classi cation of human thought is one known as Bloom ' s taxonomy. Benjamin Bloom and his team of researchers wrote exten-sively on the subject, particularly on six basic levels of cognitive outcomes they identi ed: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Bloom ' s taxonomy is hierarchical, with knowledge, comprehension, and application as fundamental levels, and analysis, synthesis, and evaluation as advanced levels. When educators refer to higher - level reasoning, they are generally referring to analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. According to Bloom ' s team, knowledge (remem- bering previously learned material) represents the most basic learning outcome, and comprehension (the ability to gain meaning) represents the basic level of understanding. Application (the ability to use learned material) is a more advanced skill because it requires both knowledge and compre-hension. Analysis (the examination of structure and relationships) is the most basic of the higher - order skills and is required for synthesis (the abil- ity to assemble ideas to create new patterns, ideas, or structures). Evaluation (assessing merit) is the highest level because it relies on elements of knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, and synthesis. Table 6.1 summarizes the key concepts in Bloom ' s taxonomy (Figure 6.1). Table 6.2 lists verbs commonly associated with each of the levels of reasoning. This table is help-ful when constructing questions to target different skills, but students should realize that words alone do not ensure a given skill. The following questions from a physics test on motion represent all six levels of Bloom ' s tax-onomy. A rationale is provided for each classi- cation, but alternative classi cations are possible depending on the prior knowledge of the students. For example, the comprehension question could be considered a knowledge question if students had memorized a textbook explanation. After reviewing the physics questions on motion below, classify the chemistry, biology, and earth science questions. The questions are written so each set has represent atives from all six levels of Bloom ' s taxonomy. Note that it is not necessary to under-stand the content of these questions in order to identify the level of reasoning they represent. Knowledge: Write the formula that describes the motion of a falling object near the Earth ' s surface. Rationale: This requires recalling the memorized formula. Comprehension: Explain why objects fall more slowly on the Moon than on Earth. Table 6.1 Bloom ' s Taxonomy of Cognitive Skills Knowledge: Remembering and recalling speci cs (terminology, facts, gures), ways and means (trends, classi cation, criteria, methodology), and abstractions (principles, generalizations, theories) Comprehension: Demonstrating understanding by translation (words to numbers, one language to another), interpretation (explaining, summarizing), and extrapolation (making inferences, predicting consequences) Application: Using facts, techniques, rules, methods, concepts, principles, theories, and laws to solve or resolve problems or issues Analysis: Examining and breaking information into components to identify facts and hypotheses, distinguish relevant from irrelevant, and understand relationships, structure, and organizational principles Synthesis: Creating new hypotheses, plans, patterns, solutions, structures, communications, or abstract relationships Evaluation: Judging the validity and usefulness of hypotheses, theories, statements, reports, solutions, or relationships using criteria, evidence, and logic c06.indd 108 c06.indd 108 5/9/08 6:04:45 Rationale: This requires understanding the dif- ference between the masses of the Moon and Earth and how this affects acceleration. Application: A baseball falls from a height of 30 m. Ignoring air resistance, calculate the time the ball hits the ground. Rationale: This requires applying a kinematics equation to derive the answer to this problem. Analysis: A bullet is red from a rifl e aimed at the horizon, and at the same time an identi-cal bullet is dropped from the same height as the muzzle of the gun. Ignoring air resist-ance, compare and contrast the trajectory of both bullets and the time required to hit the ground. Rationale: This requires examining the similarities and differences of the trajec-tories, and distinguishing relevant from irrel-evant information to answer the question. Synthesis: Bowling balls, bask etballs, baseballs, golf balls, and Ping - Pong balls fall at the same rate in a vacuum. Develop a hypothesis that predicts the order they will hit the ground if dropped from a height of 1000 m in air. Explain your reasoning. Rationale: This ques- tion requires generating and substantiating a hypothesis based on established principles, prior knowledge, and experience. Evaluation: Legend has it that Galileo investi- gated the motion of falling bodies by dropping cannon balls from the leaning tower of Pisa. In reality, his studies of motion were conducted by rolling objects down inclined planes. Discuss the advantages this method may have held for Galileo. Rationale: This requires judging the merits of Galileo ' s approach using criteria and logic.

ACTIVITY 6.1.4 Writing Questions That Test Each Educational Objective Good sci entists know how to ask good ques-tions. Good questions develop the mind and lead to other good questions. Write six questions for a theme you are currently studying, one for each level of reasoning. Write one knowledge ques-tion, one comprehension question, one applica-tion question, one anal ysis question, one synthesis question, and one evaluat ion question. Identify the level of reasoning required to answer each. 6.2 Inductive Reasoning Science may be de ned as the development and organization of knowledge of the physical uni-verse through observation, experiment, and rea-son, and the body of knowledge gained from such acti vities. The word science comes from the Latin scientia, meaning knowledge, because science is a way of knowing about the physical world. One of the primary ways scientists discover new knowl-edge is through inductive reasoning: the logic of developing generalizations, hypotheses, and theories from speci c observations and experi- ments. The premises or observations support the conclusion or generalization but do not ensure it. The following examples of inductive reasoning illustrate how it is used to develop reasonable, although not certain, conclusions. Physicists have repeatedly measured the accel- eration due to gravity at sea level to be 9.8 m/s 2 , and this value is now an accepted constant, even though it has not been tested everywhere that is at sea level on the Earth ' s surface. As with all other conclusions derived by induction, it is possi-ble that this generalization is fl awed. It is possible, although extremely unlikely, that newer measure-ments will show different values at places not yet measured. c06.indd 111 c06.indd 111 5/9/08 6:04:47 PM 5/9/08 6:04:47 PM112 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Scientists have noted that (1) ice in Greenland is melting faster than it is forming, (2) glaciers in Alaska are retreating, (3) the Northwest Passage is navigable for the rst time in history, and (4) Antarctic ice is receding. Based on these and other observations, scientists infer that global temperature is rising. Although these observations support the conclusion, they do not ensure it. Other explanations, though unlikely, could explain the observed phenomenon. For example, it is pos-sible that the ice elds are shrinking not because of increasing temperatures but because of decreas-ing ones. If temperatures are cooler, there is less oceanic evaporation, there are fewer clouds, and there is less snowfall over the ice elds. Although it is highly unlikely, the retreat of ice elds may be due not to increased melting but due to decreased snowfall to replenish that which has been lost to melting. As seen in both of the examples, the premises or observations used in inductive rea-soning support the conclusion or generalization but do not ensure it. ACTIVITY 6.2.1 Deriving the Pendulum Equation by Inductive Reasoning (Physics) N ewton ' s second law of motion ( F 5 ma ) and the ideal gas law ( PV 5 nRT ) were derived by general- izing from empirical data. In this activity, you will develop part of an equation for the period (the time of one cycle) of a pendulum as a function of mass and length. Y ou can develop your own pen-dulum with lengths and masses of your choos-ing, or use the data from Table 6.4. Plot the period of the pendulum on the y - axis and the length on the x - axis. The period of a pendulum is the time required for the pendulum to return to its origi-nal position. T o determine the period, measure 10 cycles and take the average. On a second graph, plot the period of the pen- dulum on the y - axis and the mass on the x - axis. Compare the graphs with those in Figure 6.2. If the graph is a horizontal line, such as y /H11005 4, then there is no relationship between the two variables and the factor (the variable plotted on the x - axis) is not in the equation. If it resembles the square ( y /H11005 x 2 ), direct ( square root ( y /H11005 x 1/2 ) graph, then the corresponding relationship should appear in your nal equation. Which of the fol- lowing relationships is consistent with your data? ( T /H11005 period, L /H11005 length of the pendulum, and m /H11005 mass of the pendulum. The other factors are constants.)

The shade of a paint chip is analogous to \" atomic mass. \" Thus, a light blue paint chip represents an element of lower atomic mass while a dark blue paint chip represents an ele-ment that has similar properties as the light blue chip, but with higher atomic mass. Arrange all chips with similar colors in the same column (family) and all colors with similar intensity (shade) in the same row (series). In the real Periodic Table of the Elements, properties gradually change from metallic to nonmetallic as you proceed through a series from the left to the right across the table. Y ou may illustrate this con-cept by arranging your columns in the sequence of the visible spectrum: red - orange - yellow - green - blue - violet. Place the reddest colors on the left of your table and the most violet colors on the right (Figure 6.4). ACTIVITY 6.2.3 Making Inferences About the Cell Cycle from Photographs (Biology) Materials: microscope and onion root tip slides, or the data provided . ACTIVITY 6.2.2 Developing a Periodic Table by Inductive Reasoning (Chemistry) Materials: Paint chips (available from a home improvement or paint store) The pioneering Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleyev analyzed data of the elements and found that when arranged according to their atomic weight, properties repeated at predictable intervals. Mendeleyev developed a table in which he arranged elements with similar properties in columns of ascending atomic mass. His table provided a general summary of the elements, had tremendous predic-tive value, and is widely used in its revised form, the periodic table of the elements (Figure 6.3). In this activity, you will engage in an analo- gous process as you arrange paint color chips into an organized \" periodic table. \" Y our instructor will provide you with an envelope containing paint chips of a variety of colors and intensities. Apply the following rules as you arrange the chips. The basic color of a paint chip represents its \" che- mical \" properties. For example, all blue paint chips can be considered to have similar pro-perties, signi cantly different from those of red chips. The basic color of a chip is analogous to 3 45678 91 0 1 1 1 213 14 15 16 17 Lanthanide Series Actinide Series Figure 6.3 Periodic Table of the Elements c06.indd 113 c06.indd 113 5/9/08 6:04:48 PM Sourcebook Teaching Science An inference is a conclusion drawn inductively from evidence and reasoning. Inferences may be wrong, but if done logically from sound data, they provide a great wealth of useful ideas. Scientists make inferences when they are unable to make direct observations. Paleontologists make infer-ences about extinct organisms from fossils, clima-tologists make inferences about past climates by examining tree rings in petri ed wood, and phy- sicians make inferences about patient health from blood pressure, pulse, and other vital signs. In this activity, you will make inferences about a dynamic process, the cell cycle, from static pho-tographs. Figure 6.5 is a photograph of an onion root tip showing cells in various stages of the cell cycle. Learn to classify the stages of mitosis in onion cells by examining Figure 6.5, and then count the number of onion cells in each stage in one or more prepared microscope slides. Collect classroom data and report in a table such as Table 6.5. If you are unable to gather class data, use the table provided in Table 6.5. Examine the data, and make generalizations or hypotheses, or both, about the cell cycle in onion root tips.

Much of our modern life, particularly transporta-tion, revolves around the combustion of gasoline and other petroleum products. Many geologists believe we have passed the time of peak produc-tion, however, and that each year we will produce less than previous years, despite the fact that the demand for oil is growing as the Earth ' s popula-tion and economies grow. Although there is much research into alternative energy, the reality is that our societies will be dependent on petroleum for years to come. Geologists are continually searching for new oil reserves, but how do they nd them? Drilling is expensive and occurs only after geolo-gists can draw a reasonable inference that oil exists. Exploration geologists are successful because they can predict the likelihood of oil on the basis of geological features. They understand patterns and know that they will not nd oil in igneous rock, but may nd it in sedimentary formations, particularly in regions once occupied by ancient seas and accom-panied by features known as salt domes. Exploration geologists infer the presence of oil on the basis of pat-terns they observe, even though they are not certain until they drill. Although they are not always correct, their ability to see pat terns and drill in areas where they nd these pat terns enables them to nd oil. Geo- logists, like all other scientists, develop generaliza-tions when they see repeated patterns in the data. In this activity, you will use the same type of inductive reasoning to see patterns and develop generalizations and hypotheses regarding volcano and earthquake activity. On a world map, plot the distribution of the world ' s most famous volca-noes (Table 6.6) and the largest earthquakes since 1900 (Table 6.7). Place a world map on the wall, and use map pins or adhesive colored dots to iden-tify the volcanoes in red and the earthquakes in blue. Each student can plot a few points until all are plotted. Y ou may need to use an almanac or perform an Internet search to locate your features. Alternatively, each student can plot all of the events on a small world map. On the same chart, plot the epicenters of earthquakes from the past week or month as reported by the U.S. Geological Survey (look online at sciencesourcebook.com, earthquake. usgs.gov. , or search \" USGS recent earthquakes \" ). 1. Explain the relationship between the distribu- tion of volcanoes and earthquakes, if any. 2. Explain the relationship between the distribu- tion of volcanoes and earthquakes, and any geographical features, if any. 3. Explain the relationship of the distribution of current earthquakes with ones from the past. 4. Generate one or more hypotheses about the occurrence of earthquakes or volcanoes, or both, on the basis of this information. 5. Perform an Internet search for a map showing tectonic plate boundaries. Is there any correla-tion between the location of earthquakes and volcanoes, and plate boundaries? If so, explain.

A premise is a previous statement or proposition from which another is inferred or follows as a conclusion. Unlike induc-tive reasoning, which always involves uncertainty, the conclusions from deductive inference are certain provided the premises are true. Scientists use inductive reasoning to formulate hypoth-eses and theories and deductive reasoning when applying them to speci c situations. The following are examples of deductive reasoning: Physics: Electric Circuits First premise: The current in an electrical circuit is directly proportional to the voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance ( I /H11005 V/R ). Second premise: The resistance in a circuit is doubled. Inference: Therefore, the current is cut in half. Chemistry: Element Classi cation First premise: Noble gases are stable. Second premise: Neon is a noble gas. Inference: Therefore, neon is Biology: Plant Classi premise: Apple fl owers have ve petals. Inference: Therefore, apple trees are not monocots. Astronomy: Planetary Motion First premise: The ratio of the squares of the peri- ods of any two planets is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their average distances from the S u n . TR TR12 13 22 23///H11005 Second premise: Earth is closer to the Sun than Mars. Inference: Therefore, Earth orbits the Sun faster than Mars. ACTIVITY 6.3.1 Deducing the Wavelength of Sound (Physics) Materials needed: tuning forks, 1 L graduated cylinder or equally deep sink or container, 1 \" or 2 \" diameter PVC or glass pipe; or use the sample data provided . The following premises apply to a pipe that has one open end and one sealed end: Premise 1: A resonant \" standing wave \" is estab- lished when two sound waves of the same amplitude and wavelength travel in opposite directions.

Premise 3: A tube with one open end resonates when its length is one quarter the wavelength of sound (1/4 /H9261 ). Inference: The wavelength of sound is four times the shortest length of pipe that resonates. We can therefore determine the wavelength of sound by nding the shortest length of pipe in which the sound will resonate and multiplying its length by four. Use a hacksaw to cut a section (length 50 cm or more) of Plexiglas, PVC, or ABS pipe ( diameter 2.5 cm or more), and immerse it in an upright position in a large graduated cylinder or other deep container. Hold a vibrating middle C (261.6 Hz) tuning fork above the cylinder (Figure 6.6), and slowly raise the pipe until it resonates and the amplitude of the sound increases signi cantly. The shortest length at which the pipe resonates is known as the fundamental mode and is one - quarter the length of the sound wave. Measure the length of the air - lled pipe and multiply by four to determine the wavelength ( /H9261 ) of sound generated by the tuning fork. Continue raising the pipe, and note that the volume decreases before it increases again at the third harmonic. Record the length of the third harmonic. Is it three times the length of the rst harmonic? Repeat this process using other tuning forks in the octave scale and record your results in Table 6.8. ACTIVITY 6.3.2 Chemistry Deducing the Relative Sizes of Atomic Radii Chemical reactions occur as outermost (valence) electrons of different atoms are shared or exchanged. Electrons are easily lost if the atomic radius (dis-tance between the nucleus and the outermost elec-tron) is large relative to the nuclear charge and are held tightly if the atomic radius is small relative to the nuclear charge. Atomic radius is a useful tool in predicting ionization energy, electron af nity, and many other properties of the elements. Although it is necessary to consult a reference to know the pre-cise atomic radii, it is possible to estimate relative atomic radii given the following premises: Premise 1: Atomic radii increase within a family. Premise 2: Atomic radii decrease within a series. Inference: Using this information, one can draw a graph of relative atomic radii versus atomic number. The rst premise (atomic radii increase within a family) implies that atoms get larger as one pro-ceeds from the top of a column (group, family) in the periodic table to the bottom. This is a conse-quence of the increasing number of electron shells. For example, in group 8, helium is the small-est because it has only one shell, while neon is larger because it has two shells, and argon is larger still because it has three shells. The second premise 1/4 Figure 6.6 Determining the Wavelength of Sound Table 6.8 Tube Lengths and Wavelengths (m) Note L /H9261 (4 /H11003 L) Note L /H9261 (4 /H11003 L ) C G D A E B F C c06.indd 117 c06.indd 117 5/9/08 6:04:51 PM 5/9/08 6:04:51 PM118 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science is based on the fact that opposite charges attract. The nucleus is positively charged and electrons are negatively charged, and the force of the attraction between these is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely related to the square of the distances between them F /H11005 k(q 1 q 2 )/r 2 . As one proceeds across a row (series) in the periodic table, the number of protons increases, causing the force of attraction on the valence electrons to be greater. This reduces the radius as the electrons are pulled more strongly by the nucleus. Using the premises stated above, sketch a graph of atomic radius ( y - axis) as a function of atomic number ( x - axis). This will be an approximate graph and only represents major trends. ACTIVITY 6.3.3 Deducing the Sources of Communicable Diseases (Biology) Epide miologists study the origin and spread of diseases. Communicable diseases are passed from one person to another as pathogens travel through air, fl uids, or direct contact between individu- als. Table 6.9 lists the leading cause of death in developed and developing nations. The italicized items are communicable diseases. Note that the third, fourth, and eighth leading causes of death in developing nations are communicable disease, while only one of the top 10 causes of death in developed nations are in this category. This is an indication that epidemiologists, physicians, and public health specialists have done a good job of identifying the sources of disease and the ways to control them. Epidemiologists often use survey data and deductive reasoning to determine the sources of disease. In this activity, you will collect your own data (or use the data in Table 6.10 if you are unable to do the activity) in an effort to determine the source of a \" disease. \" Each person is provided with two test tubes that are placed upright in clear plastic cups. Each pair of test tubes is marked with an identify-ing number and labeled C (for control) or E (for experimental). For example, student number 5 has two identical test tubes labeled 5C and 5E. All test tubes contain an equal amount of water, with the exception of one pair that contains an equal volume of dilute solution of sodium hydroxide (0.01 N; made by adding 0.4 g of sodium hydrox-ide to 1 L of water). Avoid spilling fl uids; if you contact the fl uid, rinse the area with water. The test tubes containing dilute sodium hydroxide represent a person with a communica-ble disease. All other tubes represent healthy peo-ple. No one except the teacher knows who received the \" infected \" tubes, and it is the goal of the class to nd out. At the teacher ' s command, pair up with another member of the class, record that per-son ' s number, and exchange a couple milliliters of fl uid with each other using a Beral pipette or eye- dropper. Alternatively, you pour a little from your container to theirs and visa versa. This is time 1 ( T 1 ). Repeat this process twice when instructed by the teacher ( T 2 , T 3 ). After the third (for classes of 20 or fewer) or fourth (for classes of 40 or fewer) exchange, the teacher will place a drop of phenol-phthalein solution in all of the experimental test tubes. A pink color indicates \" infection \" because phenolphthalein turns pink in basic solutions such as the one containing sodium hydroxide and all other cups contaminated by it. Create a table on the board or an overhead transparency, and indicate the people who exchanged at each interval as shown in Table 6.10. Put boxes around the names or numbers of the people who are Table 6.9 Leading Causes of Death, 2001 Developed Nations Developing Nations 1. Heart disease 2. Stroke 3. Lung cancer 4. Lower respiratory infections 5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 6. Colon cancers 7. Alzheimer ' s disease 8. Diabetes 9. Breast cancer 10. Stomach cancer 1. Heart disease 2. Stroke 3.

Road traf c accidents c06.indd 6:04:52 PMDeveloping Scienti c Reasoning Skills 119 \" infected \" as indicated by pink coloration ( nal column, Table 6.10). Using the following premises, deduce the possible sources of the disease. Y ou should be able to narrow to two possibilities. Premise 1: A clear tube has not mixed with any \" infected \" tubes. Premise 2: A pink tube has mixed with \" infected \" tubes (or is the source). Using logic, you can identify tubes that could not have been the source. Y ou can deduce that if a test tube is clear after the nal exchange, then none of the tubes that it mixed with could have been the source. For example, in Table 6.10, test tube 3 is clear, and therefore you can deduce that tubes 14, 19, and 20 could not have been the source. Tube 2 is infected but cannot be the source because it exchanged with tube 20, which is still clear at the end. Tube 20 would have been pink had tube 2 have been the source. Using deductive reasoning, identify the two possible sources of the disease. Once all of the students have predicted the source of the disease, the teacher will place an equal amount of phenolphthalein in each of the control tubes. Only the tube representing the source of the disease will turn pink. The control tubes represent abstinence (in the case of sexually transmitted dis-eases like HIV/AIDS or syphilis), vaccination (in the case of measles of tetanus), or masks (in the case of respiratory illnesses). ACTIVITY 6.3.4 Determining the Epicenter of an Earthquake by Deduction (Geology) Seismologists determine the epicenter (the point on the earth ' s surface directly above the focus of a seismic event) of an earthquake by deductive reasoning. Earthquakes propagate p waves and s waves that can be measured on seismographs distant from the epicenter. Figure 6.7 shows that p waves travel faster and reach the seismograph sooner than s waves: Premise 1: Earthquakes release compression waves (P waves) that travel at 7 km/s in Earth ' s crust (this value varies depending upon crust composition) Premise 2: Earthquakes emit shear waves S - waves) that travel at 58 percent the speed of P waves, or 4 km/s. Inference: The distance to the epicenter can be calculated by the formula: dtt r r rrsp ps/H11005/H11002 /H11002() ( )21 This can be deduced using the following algebra: Since distance is the product of rate and time ( d /H11005 rt ), the distance from the epicenter, d, can be represented using the primary wave (indicated with a subscript of p) as d /H11005 r p t p , and with the secondary wave (indicated with a sub-script of s) as d /H11005 r s t s . Once the primary wave hits the seismograph, t 1 seconds have elapsed since the Table 6.10 Data for Communicable Diseases Person T 1 T 2 T 3 Person T 1 T 2 T 3 1 19 16 2 11 9 14 17 2 20 7 1 12 7 15 10 3 14 19 20 13 17 8 14 4 18 5 8 14 3 11 13 5 6 4 16 15 16 12 19 6 5 20 7 16 15 1 5 7 12 2 6 17 13 9 11 8 10 13 4 18 4 10 9 9 11 17 18 19 1 3 15 10 8 18 12 20 2 6 3 p-wave s-wavetime differential time Figure 6.7 P Waves and S Waves c06.indd 119 c06.indd 119 5/9/08 6:04:52 PM 5/9/08 6:04:52 PM120 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science earthquake, and by the time the slower S wave hits the seismograph, t 2 seconds have elapsed. So t 2 /H11002 t 1 represents the elapsed time, or ( d/r s /H11002 d/r p ): t t dr dr ttrd r d rr ttdrsp ps sp /H11002/H11005/H11002 /H11002/H11005/H11002// ( ps) () ( ) /H11005/H11002 /H1100221 Therefore, you can calculate the distance from the epicenter, d, if you know the velocities of the P wave and S wave, and the elapsed time between them ( t 2 /H11002 t 1 ). Assuming speeds of 7 km/s for P waves, and 4 km/s for S waves, we can calculate the distance as: dttk m s k m s Thus, using the principles of algebra and the two premises of earthquake waves, we deduced that the distance to the epicenter can be calcu-lated by multiplying the time differential ( t 2 /H11002 t 1 ) between the P - wave and the S - wave by 9.3 km/s. In Figure 6.7, the difference between the S and P waves at Northridge, California, was recorded as 26.5 seconds. Therefore, the distance to the epi-center was 26 593246 ..skm skm /H11003 = Knowing the scale on the map, one can draw a circle with a center at Northridge and a radius of 246 km (Figure 6.8). The epicenter is somewhere on this circle. By examining the seismographs at Davis and Santa Cruz, we nd that the epicenter was 363 and 208 km from each of these locations, respectively. By drawing the circles on the map, you can see that they all intersect in one point near Moro Bay, California, and can deduce that this is the epicenter of the earthquake.

Complete Table 6.11. 6.4 Lateral Thinking Lateral thinking is the ability to approach problems from a variety of perspectives rather than only from the single most obvious approach. Consider the fol-lowing question: Example 1: On January 5, 2006, a jet traveled east from Quito, Ecuador, at 800 km/hour. How far did it travel in 3 hours? The standard way to approach this question is to calculate the distance relative to a point on the Earth ' s surface by multiplying the speed of the jet (800 km/h) by the time in fl ight (3 hours). Alternatively, you could calculate the speed relative to the Earth ' s center by factoring in the rotational speed of the earth at the equator (1675 km/h) on which Quito sits. Another way to approach this question is to include the speed relative to the Sun, in which case you would also need to consider the Earth ' s orbital speed of 107,826 km/h. Finally, you could consider other variables such as the direc-tions and magnitudes of winds on January 5, 2006. Although such solutions may seem silly given the context in which such a question is tradition-ally asked, the ability to analyze the question from different perspectives is not. Lateral thinking exer-cises, such as those that follow, are used to help executives, engineers, planners, and designers think of alternative solutions to the problems they face. Not all alternatives are of equal merit, and although it is important to think of alternative ways of doing things, it is also important to evaluate the relative merit of each. Many lateral thinking exercises are expressed as riddles, such as the one that follows: Example 2: An explorer travels 1 km due south, then 1 km west, followed by 1 km north to arrive at the place he started. Where is this explorer? This question seems impossible. Every- one knows that to return to the same location, the explorer must complete the fourth side of the square and travel 1 km east. This question can only be solved by thinking outside the box to an environment unlike your own. An explorer to the North Pole (such as Robert Perry or Matthew Henson) could accomplish this task by leaving the North Pole, traveling 1 km south, 1 km west, and then return 1 km north. This is possible because all longitudes (north - south meridians) converge at the North Pole. ACTIVITY 6.4.1 Lateral Thinking Edward deBono, a cognitive psychologist who popularized lateral thinking activities, argues that such exercises help us become more creative and 100 kmscale Figure 6.9 Map for Determining the Epicenter of Earthquakes c06.indd 121 c06.indd 121 5/9/08 6:05:00 PM 5/9/08 6:05:00 PM122 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science insightful. Many problems in science are solved only when researchers drop their assumptions and adopt a novel approach. For example, vitamins were dis-covered only after researchers stopped looking for a pathogenic cause for beriberi and started looking for the absence of some essential material. The following riddles can be solved only by dropping standard assumptions and approach-ing the question from different perspectives. Some of following are adapted from widely circulated riddles whose original authorship is unknown. Provide plausible solutions for each, noting that there may be more than one way to solve each riddle: 1. A chemistry stockroom technician is 188 cm (6 ' 2 \" ) tall. What does he weigh? 2. A rope ladder is hung over the side of research vessel in the Bay of Fundy so that the bottom rung just reaches the water. If the rungs are 20 cm apart, how many rungs will be under water when the tide rises 3 m? 3. A research ecologist drank heavily from the punchbowl at a research picnic in the Himalayan Mountains. He left the party early and was surprised to nd that all of his team came down with giardiasis (a waterborne dis-ease) the next day, even though nothing was added to the punch after he left and no one had drunk anything since the party. 4. The younger of two twins celebrates her birth- day 2 days before her older twin. How can this be if both twins are celebrating their birthdays on the calendar days on which they were born? 5. A mineralogist examines seven crystals that are identical except that one has slightly less mass than the other six. How can the miner-alogist determine which is the smallest crys-tal using just a double pan balance and two measurements? 6. Why do civil engineers design round manhole covers rather than square ones? 7. A botanist is growing plants in three sealed, windowless growth chambers, but can ' t remember which of three light switches controls the light in chamber C, 100 m away. T o minimize disturbance to the plants, he can open the chamber only once for 5 seconds. How can he determine which switch controls the light in chamber C? 8. How far can an elk run into the woods? 9. A boat is fl oating in the lock of a canal. What will happen to the water level in the lock if an anchor is thrown overboard? 10.

Note that mass ( m ) does not appear in the equation because period is independent of mass (the plot of period versus mass is a horizontal line). Note that the graph of period versus length resembles the square root function ( y /H11005 x 1/2 ), so T must be a function of L . Answer d is the only one that lls this criterion. With more effort, students could gure out the entire equa- tion, but for our purposes, it is suf cient to infer that the period is independent of the pendulum mass, but directly proportional to the square root of the length. 6.2.2 Students use inductive reasoning to develop a periodic table of paint chips from the data before them (color, shade). When Mendeleyev developed his original table, he noticed that there were gaps and predicted the pres- ence and properties of elements not yet discovered. 122 5/9/08 6:05:02 PM 5/9/08 6:05:02 PMDeveloping Scienti c Reasoning Skills 123 Y ou may wish to omit one or more chips and ask students to determine which ones are missing. 6.2.3 Students may infer that cells spend more time in interphase than in mitosis (prophase, metaphase, ana-phase, telophase). They may also conclude that divid-ing cells spend the most time in prophase, followed by telophase, metaphase, and anaphase. Students should identify the assumptions they have made when draw-ing these inferences. 6.2.4 Students may make a variety of generalizations including: (1) The distribution of earthquakes is similar to the distri- bution of volcanoes. (2) Earthquakes and volcanoes appear to occur in lines and are more common on the boundaries of conti-nents than in the centers. (3) Recent earthquakes are distributed in much the same way as older events. (4) The east and west edges of the Paci c Ocean are par- ticularly active. Scientists used these observations, along with seafl oor spread- ing and continental drift, when they developed the theory of plate tectonics using inductive logic. Students may hypothesize that there is a relationship between earthquakes, volcanoes, and plate boundaries if they are familiar with the concepts of plate tectonics. (5) Earthquakes and volcanoes are distributed close to the plate boundaries. After the students have plotted the data, show them the plate boundaries (Figure 6.10) and discuss how seismic data is used to identify plate boundaries. 6.3.1 The wavelength of a fundamental tone (lowest reso- nant frequency) is approximately 4 times the length of a closed tube ( /H9261: /H11005 4 /H11003 L ) as shown in Table 6.12. Experimentation, however, shows that the diameter of the tube also infl uences the frequency. When the diam- eter of the tube is considered, the equation becomes: /H9261: /H11005 4( L /H11002 0.4 d). Use this formula for more precise measurements and predictions. 6.3.2 Given the premises, students may deduce a graph of relative atomic radii versus atomic number such as the one shown by the dashed line in Figure 6.11. If students can generate a graph similar to this, they have demonstrated the understanding necessary to predict other properties, such as ionization energy and elec-tron af nity. Although a graph drawn by deduction (dashed line) will not have all of the nuances of the real values (solid line), it shows that students understand the basic factors determining atomic radii. 6.3.3 Students should be able to deduce that one of two people was the source of the disease. The bold type in the nal column indicates people that were \" infected \" at the time of testing (Table 6.13). Y ou can narrow the list of candidates for the source of the disease to either person number 7 or 12.

Because all individuals exchanged at T 1 , it is impossible to identify the true source until the controls are tested. The size of the data table will depend on the number of students in your class. For example, a class of 36 will have 36 rows. If there are an odd number of students in your class, one person will have to pass on each exchange. 6.3.4 The epicenters for the earthquakes were Fillmore, Inverness, San Francisco, Arcata, and Coalinga as shown in Table 6.14. All of these are located near the San Andreas Fault system, the largest fault in North America. 6.4.1 The following lists possible responses. (1) Possible solution: chemicals (2) Possible solution: None. The boat rises with the tide, and so does the rope ladder. (3) P ossible solution: The punch was cooled with ice cubes from a local water supply. The protozoan that causes gia-rdiasis was released to the punchbowl as the ice melted. Since the researcher left the party early, there was insuf- cient giardia in the water to give him the disease. (4) Possible solution: The mother of the twins was on a Paci c cruise at the time she delivered her twins. The older one was born in the Eastern Hemisphere on March 1, just before the boat crossed the international dateline. The younger twin was born minutes later on February 28 in the Western Hemisphere. On leap years, the younger twin will celebrate her birthday two days earlier because of the introduction of February 29. (5) Possible solution: The mineralogist should put three crystals on one side of the balance and three on the other side. If the masses are equal, the crystal still on the table is the smaller one. If they are not equal, the smaller crystal is on the side with less mass, and the Table 6.14 Locations of Epicenters seismograph Fillmore Inverness San Francisco Arcata Coalinga s km s km s km s km s km Davis 57 526 12 109 11 104 35 327 32 294 Santa Cruz 43 402 16 145 10 95 50 468 19 176 Northridge 4 40 62 580 57 527 95 886 29 270 mineralogist should clear the pans, take two from this side, and place them on opposite pans. If these two crystals are of equal mass, the smaller crystal is the third member from this group. If the masses are une-qual, the crystal on the pan that registers less mass is the smaller one. (6) Possible solutions: This question is often given dur- ing job interviews to see how candidates reason with novel problems. Round manhole covers will not fall in the hole, while square ones can if they are tilted diagonally. Round manhole covers do not need to be aligned as they are put in place, while square ones do. Round manhole covers can be easily rolled to and from their destination, while square ones must be carried. In addition, round manhole covers are easier to manufac-ture than rectangular or square ones. (7) Possible solution: The botanist can turn on switch 1 for a couple of minutes, then turn it off and turn on switch 2 and go immediately to chamber C. If the light bulb is off and the bulb is warm, the light is controlled by switch 1. If the light is on, the light is controlled by switch 2, and if the light is off and the bulb is cool, the light is controlled by switch 3. (8) Possible solution: Halfway, because after that it is running out of the woods. (9) Solution: Th e water level will fall slightly. While the anchor is onboard, it displaces an amount of water equivalent to its weight, but when submerged, it displaces only an amount of water equivalent to its volume. Since iron is 7.8 times denser than water, it will displace 7.8 times as much water when onboard than when submerged. (10) Most of the potential problems in this question are due to truncation or lack of punctuation. Students should give a humorous interpretation as well as the probable intended meaning. c06.indd 124 c06.indd 124 5/9/08 6:05:04 PM 5/9/08 6:05:04 PM125Chapter Seven Thinking Critically and Resolving Misconceptions For the Teacher 125 7.1 Critical Thinking 126 7.2 Evaluating Claims 129 7.3 Using a Decision - Making Matrix 131 7.4 Misconceptions in Physics 132 7.5 Misconceptions in Chemistry 135 7.6 Misconceptions in Biology 137 7.7 Misconceptions in Earth and Space Science 139 Answers to Chapter Activities 142 For the Teacher Critical thinking is the process of analyzing and evaluating information to determine its veracity or plausibility. There is no set pattern to critical thinking, but it often involves the following: Identi cation of premises and conclusions. Critical thinkers break arguments into basic state-ments and draw logical implications. Clari cation of arguments. Critical thinkers locate ambiguity and vagueness in arguments and propositions. Establishment of facts. Critical thinkers deter- mine if the premises are reasonable and iden-tify information that has been omitted or not collected. They determine if the implications are logical and search for potentially contra-dictory data. Evaluation of logic. Critical thinkers determine if the premises support the conclusion. In deductive arguments, the conclusions must be true if the premises are true. In inductive arguments, the conclusions are likely if the premises are true. Final evaluation. Critical thinkers weigh the evi- dence and arguments. Supporting data, logic, and evidence increase the weight of an argu-ment. Contradictions and lack of evidence decrease the weight of an argument. Critical thinkers do not accept propositions if they think there is more evidence against them or c07.indd 125 c07.indd 125 5/9/08 4:55:08 PM 5/9/08 4:55:08 PM126 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science similarity of water vapor bubbles to air bubbles is very strong and may explain why this misconcep-tion is so persistent. Other studies have shown that large numbers of astronomy graduate students hold a fundamental misconception regarding the reason for seasonality, believing that seasons are caused by the elliptical path of the Earth around the Sun rather than the tilt of the Earth ' s axis. They incorrectly conclude that summer occurs at peri-gee and winter at apogee, forgetting that seasons in the Southern Hemisphere are opposite those in the Northern Hemisphere at any point in time. The rst activity in this chapter focuses on the development of critical thinking skills, and the remaining activities use critical thinking to reveal and correct common misconceptions in science. In these later activities, you will nd lists of the most common misconceptions in physics, chemistry, biology, and earth and space science. For the rst ve in each series, we have stated a misconception, contradictory data, and nally a corrected state- ment. Y our students should use this same pattern to correct the misconceptions you assign. 7.1 Critical Thinking Critical thinkers draw conclusions only after they have de ned their terms , distinguished fact from opinion, asked relevant questions, made detailed observations, and uncovered assumptions. They make assertions based on solid evidence and sound logic. In relying on evidence, critical thinkers: Examine problems carefully. Ask pertinent questions. Identify assumptions and biases. D e ne criteria. Look for evidence. Identify missing information. And in relying on logic, critical thinkers: Assess statements and arguments. Analyze data. Consider a variety of explanations. Reject information that is incorrect or irrelevant. \u007f \u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f \u007f \u007f\u007f\u007fif the argument is unclear, omits signi cant information, or has false premises or poor logic. There are numerous misconceptions in science that spread when people repeat what they have heard without thinking critically of the issues. Francis Bacon, one of the founders of scienti c thought, said that \" the ill and un t choice of words wonderfully obstructs the understanding. \" For example, people often use the word weight when they mean mass and vice versa, causing others to think that they are the same thing. We often propa-gate misconceptions because we do not use precise language. We prefer \" everyday language, \" yet often it is not precise enough to describe or differenti-ate scienti c concepts. By deferring to colloquial speech everyday analogies, and relying heavily on visible effects and changes, it is easy to communi-cate misunderstandings. Misconceptions often arise through the use of common sense or casual observation and reason-ing. For example, many people believe that venous blood is blue based on the premise that the veins in forearms and legs have a bluish tint. A hasty conclusion is that veins appear blue because the blood within them is blue. Diagrams in books support this conclusion by coloring systemic veins blue and systemic arteries red. However, a critical analysis reveals problems in the blue - blood con-clusion. Veins do appear to have a blue or purple coloration when viewed from outside the body, but it does not necessarily follow that this col-oration is due to the color of the blood within. Perhaps overlying tissues affect their appearance, or perhaps these vessels are pigmented differently from the blood they contain. The implication is that venous blood samples should appear blue, but those who have given blood know that it is dark red, even when it is not exposed to the air. This evidence suggests that we should reject the blue - blood conclusion. Many preconceptions and misconceptions in science are persistent. For example, studies show that large percentages of chemistry graduate stu-dents believe that the bubbles in boiling water are composed of air (nitrogen and oxygen, for example) rather than vaporized water. The visual c07.indd 126 c07.indd 126 5/9/08 4:55:09 PMThinking Critically and Resolving Misconceptions 127 Admit a lack of understanding or information when necessary. Suspend judgment until all facts have been gathered and considered. Weigh evidence and draw reasoned conclusions. Adjust opinions when new facts are found. The following activities are designed to help develop critical thinking skills. Each of these activ-ities uses some of the strategies listed above. ACTIVITY 7.1.1 Constructing Data Com parison Tables Every year voters go to the polls to cast their bal-lots for candidates and initiatives. Unfortunately, \u007f \u007f\u007f \u007fmost voters base their decisions on limited and biased data. Scientists cannot afford to do their research in this way and must rely on evidence and logic. One of the simplest ways to compare evidence is through a data compari-son table. Figure 7.1 is a comparison table that illustrates the similarities and differences of two types of fl owering plants, monocots and dicots. Note how the tabular approach helps make comparisons easy. Create a similar comparison table for a topic in your curriculum such as one of those listed in Table 7.1 . Y our table should list similarities and differences as illustrated. embryo flower parts stems leaves roots ConclusionsCompare & Contrast adventitious roots roots branch from radicleovaries develops into fruits Monocots and dicots share numerous similarities as angiosperms (flowering plants), but have so many differences that they form a classification larger than a family.vascular bundles scattered in stem one ring of vascular tissue veins are parallel leaf veins are reticulatedone cotyledon in the embryo two cotyledons in the embryo flower parts come in multiples of 3 flower parts in multiples of 4 or 5Similar with respect to Different with regard toMonocots Dicots flowering plants - known as angiosperms reproductive structures are found in flowers seeds are enclosed in a true fruit ovules develops into seeds Figure 7.1 Data Comparison Table of Monocots and Dicots The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Table 7.1 Topics for Comparison Tables Physics Chemistry Inertial and noninertial frames of reference Newtonian and relativistic physics Parallel and series circuitsParticle and wave theories of lightStrong and weak nuclear forcesGravity electrostatic attractionRed fusion and nuclear ssion and of atomIonic and covalent bondsMetals and nonmetalsColloidal suspensions and solutionsOil and coal Biology Earth and Space Science Plant cells and animal cells Transcription and translationReptiles and amphibiansPhotosynthesis and chemosynthesisMojave One-time and recurring cometsRichter Scale and Mercali IndexNASA's Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 missions Barometric and global positioning systems altimetersArctic and AntarcticMount Rainier and Mount FujiGranite and basalt ACTIVITY 7.1.2 Evaluating Solutions: Sudoku Puzzles Scientists often evaluate many possible solutions before coming to a conclusion. If a proposed solution contradicts evidence, they set it aside in favor of one that is consistent with the evidence. Mathematical puzzles require this same logic and can be used to develop critical reasoning skills. Number puzzles were introduced in the United States in 1979, but later gained tremendous popularity in Japan, where they became known as sudoku puzzles, before being reintroduced to America. Each sudoku puzzle is composed of nine boxes, each containing nine cells, as shown in Figure 7.2 . T o solve the sudoku puzzle, numbers must be placed in empty cells such that all nine of the nine - celled boxes have all of the numbers from 1 to 9. In addition, each row and column in the complete table of 81 cells must have all of the numbers from 1 to 9. Solve the puzzles in Figures 7.2 A to 7.2 D, and identify the critical thinking skills necessary to do so from the list above. Y ou can continue to build your skills by solv- ing sudoku puzzles found in newspapers or on the Internet (at sciencesourcebook.com or search \" sudoku \" ). 7.2 Evaluating Claims Advertisement is the promotion of goods and services with the goal of increasing sales and rev-enue. Without critical thinking skills, consumers can fall for a variety of false claims. For example, in the nineteenth century, stores sold Bonnore ' s Electro Magnetic Bathing Fluid, which claimed to cure cholera, neuralgia, epilepsy, scarlet fever, necrosis, mercurial eruptions, paralysis, hip dis-eases, chronic abscesses, and \" female complaints. \" Many consumers purchased the product with hopes that it would cure their ailments, but others rejected the claims after using one or more of the following critical thinking strategies: Identi cation of biases. The Bonnore Company had a vested interest in selling this fl uid and therefore might have been biased in the pres-entation of its claims. Examination of evidence. There were no medical reports on Bonnore ' s Electro Magnetic Bathing Fluid. If it had cured any of these con-ditions, one would have expected published reports by nonbiased researchers. Assessment of statements and claims. It is unlikely that any medical treatment could cure such a wide range of maladies. Cholera is caused by bacteria and affects the digestive tract. Neuralgia is generally caused by viruses and affects the cra-nial nerves of the nervous system. Hip diseases may be caused by metabolic disorders or skeletal system diseases. \" Female complaints \" are a vague collection of problems, but likely caused by hor-mones affecting the reproductive system. It is highly unlikely that a single medicine could cure diseases with such different causes that affect such different systems. Evaluation of evidence. The evidence suggests that the medicinal claims for Bonnore ' s Electro Magnetic Bathing Fluid were false or grossly exaggerated. ACTIVITY 7.2.1 Evaluating Tobacco Adver tisements Early cigarette advertisements made many unsub-stantiated claims. It was common to read that smoking could improve your disposition, reduce indigestion, ease tension, keep you slender, or sim-ply provide a \" lift \" (see sciencesourcebook.com , or search \" chester eld cigarette ads \" ). One 1946 ad said, \" 24 hours a day, your doctor is on duty . . . a few winks of sleep, a few puffs of a cigarette . . . and he ' s back at the job again. \" Others made claims such as these: \" More doctors smoke Camels than any other Cigarette, \" \" For digestion ' s sake \u2014 smoke Camels, \" or \" Just what the doctor ordered. \" T oday it is dif cult to make such blatantly bogus claims since the Federal Trade Commission requires that advertisers have evidence to back up their claims. Additional legislation requires that all cigarette advertisements and packages marketed in the United States carry prescribed warnings such as: \" Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphy-sema, and may complicate pregnancy \" ; \" Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health \" ; \" Smoking by pregnant women may result in c07.indd 129 c07.indd 129 5/9/08 4:55:12 PM 5/9/08 4:55:12 PM130 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science fetal injury, premature birth, and low birth weight \" ; and \" Cigarette smoke contains carbon monox-ide. \" Despite such regulations, tobacco companies continue to advertise heavily, relying primarily on imagery and slogans rather than direct claims. Many cigarette companies have slogans that create an image but don ' t necessarily say anything false: Camel: \" Where a man belongs; I ' d walk a mile for a Camel. \" Kool: \" Come all the way up to Kool. \" Marlboro: \" Come to Marlboro Country. Come to where the fl avor is! \" Newport: \" Alive with pleasure! \" P a l l M a l l : \"Wherever particular people congregate. \" Virginia Slims: \"It ' s a woman ' s thing; Y ou ' ve come a long way, baby! \" Winston: \"Winston tastes good like a cigarette should! \" Critically analyze ve or more recent cigarette advertisements. Describe the visual messages asso-ciated with the advertisements, and identify the inferences advertisers probably want consumers to make. Evaluate these unwritten claims in the light of evidence. For example, an advertisement may show business executives smoking around a confer-ence table, creating the impression that smoking is a way to be successful in the business world. Evidence, however, shows that large numbers of major corpo-rations are smoke free and even subsidize clinics and support groups to assist employees to kick the habit. There is signi cant medical evidence showing adverse effects of smoking on the respiratory sys-tem (throat, larynx, trachea, bronchi, lungs), skeletal system (bones), muscular system (muscles, joints), circulatory system (heart, arteries), urinary sys-tem (kidneys, bladder), digestive system (stomach, intestines), nervous system (brain, eyes, nerves), endo crine system (thyroid, hormones), reproduc-tive system (reproductive organs), immune sys-tem (T cells, antibodies), and integumentary system (skin, nails). Research these effects as they pertain to the advertisements you evaluate. For example, if a cigarette advertisement portrays an athlete, discuss how smoking injures the respiratory and muscular systems on which the athlete depends, or if it pictures a model, discuss the adverse effects of smoking on the skin and nails. ACTIVITY 7.2.3 Evaluating Alcohol Ads The primary goal of advertisements is not to inform the public but to increase sales. Consumers should be aware of this bias and critically evaluate explicit and implicit advertising claims. Alcohol advertisers rarely provide factual information; rather, they create images of lifestyles they hope consumers may associate with their products. Identify the unspoken message of ve or more alcohol advertisements, and contrast these with evidence. Develop a parody advertisement for one product. Y our advertisement should resemble the original but refl ect the adverse effects associated with overconsumption. The following summary of the health and social problems commonly associ-ated with excessive alcohol consumption will help you develop your satirical advertisement: Physical Effects Related to Excessive Alcohol Consumption Impaired judgment: Alcohol consumption can lead to impaired judgment, reduced reaction time, slurred speech, and dif culty walking. Effect on body systems: When alcohol is con- sumed rapidly and in large amounts, it can result in coma and death. Alcohol may inter-act with medications and intensify their effect. Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with liver diseases, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Hangovers: Hangover symptoms such as fl ushing, nausea, and dizziness are common following excessive drinking. Fetal alcohol syndrome: Alcohol use by preg- nant women can cause serious damage to the developing fetus. Social Issues Related to Excessive Alcohol Consumption Alcohol - related deaths: In 2000, there were approximately 85,000 deaths in the United States attributable to alcohol consumption, making it the third leading cause of death. 1 \u007f and Resolving Misconceptions 131 Crime: In 1997, approximately 40 percent of all crimes in the United States were commit-ted under the infl uence of alcohol. 2 Child abuse: It is estimated that nearly half of the cases of child abuse and neglect are associ-ated with parental alcohol or drug abuse. 3 Suicide: Approximately one - fourth of all sui- cide deaths are committed under the infl uence of alcohol. 4 Risky behaviors: People who abuse alcohol are more likely to engage in dangerous behaviors, such as unsafe sexual activity and illegal drug use. 5 Traf c arrests: In 2003, approximately 1.4 mil- lion arrests were made for driving under the infl uence of alcohol or narcotics. 6 Motor vehicle deaths: In 2004, more than 17,000 people in the United States died in alcohol - related motor vehicle crashes, accounting for 41 percent of all traf c - related deaths. 7 Binge drinking: Binge drinking (periods of intense alcohol consumption) is highly cor-related with violence (homicide, suicide, child abuse, domestic violence), injuries (motor vehicle accidents, falls, burns, drownings, and hypothermia), and medical hazards (sudden infant death syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol poisoning, hypertension, sexually trans-mitted diseases, and meningitis). 8 ACTIVITY 7.2.3 Evaluating Claims of Diets, Herbal Supplements, and Medication Apply your critical thinking skills to evaluate the health - related claims of a diet (Atkins, South Beach, Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, Slim - Fast), herbal supplement (stevia, ephedra, ginkgo biloba, ginseng), or over and contrast evi- dence for the positive and negative effects. Discuss potential bene ts, side effects, costs, practicality, alternatives, and other relevant issues. 7.3 Using a Decision - Making Matrix Many decisions require the review and considera- tion of a variety of options and variables. One way of organizing issues is through the use of a deci-sion - making matrix: a rectangular array of infor-mation that allows a quick comparison of features of competing alternatives. T o develop a matrix, determine the criteria for comparison, select the alternatives to be com-pared, and generate scores based on established criteria. Table 7.2 compares three brands of a eld instrument such as a global positioning system (GPS) device or portable pH probe. The products are rated on a variety of criteria, with 5 being the highest and 0 the lowest score possible. T otaling the number of points for each option yields a score that will help in the decision - making proc-ess. In this activity, product B appears to be the best option because it received the most points. Decision - making matrices are a critical thinking tool for complex comparisons. Evaluators must choose an appropriate weighting scale to give appropriate emphasis to each criteria. ACTIVITY 7.3.1 Determining the Best Alter native Energy Sources (Earth Science) Energy shortages are a reality in modern industrial societies. In World War II there was a signi cant oil shortage, and many countries imposed ration-ing. In 1973 there was a major energy crisis when Table 7.2 Sample Decision-Making Matrix Cost Durability Accuracy Size Weight Score Product A 5 2 2 3 2 14 Product B 3 4 4 4 3 18 Product C 4 3 3 2 1 13 c07.indd 131 c07.indd 131 5/9/08 4:55:13 PM 5/9/08 4:55:13 PM132 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced that they would not ship petroleum to the United States, Western Europe, or other countries that supported Israel in its confl ict with Egypt and Syria. Soaring prices, long lines at gasoline pumps, and closed serv-ice stations were common. In 1979 another energy crisis occurred during the Iranian Revolution, and the U.S. Department of Energy, fearing a severe fuel shortage, printed gasoline - rationing coupons, although it never distributed them. Most nations are dependent on imported petro- leum, and it is only a matter of time before there is another production or distribution crisis, or sup-plies simply run out. Governments and energy com-panies are actively pursuing alternative energy sources to reduce dependency on petroleum. Unfor-tunately, each energy source has problems, so there is no clear choice regarding a replacement for petro-leum. Energy of cials must use critical reason- ing skills to determine the best options to pursue. Table 7.3 is a decision - making matrix that com-pares and contrasts the costs and bene ts associ- ated with a variety of energy sources. Assign relative values for each cell on a 1 to 5 scale, as illustrated in Table 7.2 , and total each row to determine which energy source you think is most promising. Write a persuasive essay encouraging the development of the energy source that rates highest in your deci-sion - making matrix. Defend your choice using data from the matrix and other sources. ACTIVITY 7.3.2 Using a Decision - Making Matrix for Environmental Issues The decision - making matrix is useful for a wide range of scienti cally based decisions, particularly in the eld of environmental policy and law. Select one of the following issues or an issue of your choice. Then determine the criteria for comparison (some possibilities are shown in parentheses for each issue), develop a decision - making matrix, assign values, and come to a conclusion regarding the best option. Defend your argument using data collected from the decision - making matrix and other sources. Industrial pollution control policies (pollution credits, pollution penalties, pollution tax) \u007f Land use policies for your region (preserva- tion, conservation, free market) Solid waste management (incineration and energy recovery, composting, exporting, sani-tary land lls, open dumping, ocean dumping) T echniques for increasing supplies of fresh-water (dams, groundwater , desalination, towing glaciers, cloud seeding) Population distribution effects on the environ-ment (urbanization, distributed population) Types of grazing (continuous, intensive, rota-tional) Logging (clear - cut, patch clear - cut, group selection, single tree selection, thinning, shel-terwood, salvage cutting) Wildland forest re policies for western North America (total suppression, natural burn, pre-scribed burn) Table 7.4 is a sample decision - making matrix for industrial pollution control policies. T o deter-mine which policy is best, government of cials might look at the revenue generated, the effec-tiveness in reducing pollution, and the impact on industrial production on the local economy. By assigning scores from 1 to 5 for each cell and then totaling each row, public policymakers might be able to come to a conclusion on the best policy. 7.4 Misconceptions in Physics All of us have misconceptions about the way the world works. We acquired many of these early in life by inadequate observation and false assump-tions, but others are spread by inexact textbooks and movies that do not refl ect reality. For exam- ple, movies may show visible laser beams (laser beams are not visible unless refl ected by dust or other matter), exploding cars (cars don ' t explode on impact), conversations in outer space (sound does not travel in a vacuum), and guns that do not recoil (a violation of conservation of momentum). Most misconceptions can be identi ed by careful observation and use of critical thinking strategies. Consider the following misconceptions and how for Alternative Energy Sources Description Abundance Accessibility CostsSafety and Environment Ease of UseOilNonrenewable fossil fuel; formed by compression of ancient organismsWorldwide resources being depleted; U.S. has small reserveLocating oil is getting more dif cult as the more accessible oil elds have already been tappedExisting technologies for extraction, re nement, storage, shipment, and use keep prices downFlammable, toxic, and carcinogenic; major source of air pollution in urban areasPortable and easy to use in motor vehiclesNatural gasNonrenewable gaseous fossil fuel; methaneU.S. has large reserves Located in places that are dif cult to develop, such as northern AlaskaDoes not require re nement; distribution systems are extensive, keeping costs reasonableExplosive gas, but relatively clean burningDif cult to use in vehicles; good home distribution networkCoalNonrenewable fossil fuel from metamorphosed vegetationU.S. 25% of world's supply; more abun-dant than oilOver 40% is currently mined from deep mines; most of the reserves are less accessibleRequires no re nement; shipped by railroad to power plants; use in homes is minimalMining very hazardous; major cause of acid rain; strip mines destroy landscapeNot useful for vehicles; good for generating electricityNuclearNonrenewable energy derived from ssion of uraniumU.S. reserves can power current reactors for 30 yearsUranium ore is low yield, requiring large minesExtremely expensive to mine, build reactors, and meet safety and environ-mental standardsSafety record good, radioactive waste extremely hazardous and dif cult to storeMust be converted to electricity for home useGeothermalSemirenewable; productivity falls if gradient drops due to overusePlentiful because the Earth's mantle is made of hot magmaRequires a signi cant temperature gradient that generally occurs only deep in the earth's crustExpensive to develop new technologies and wells that tap deep gradients; energy is free once facil-ities builtVery few safety or environmental concernsNot portable; can't be used in cars and trucksWindRenewable; turbines in dams produce electricityAbundant, depending on topographyWindy areas, such as oceans and mountains, are dif cult to exploitCost of turbines is very high; energy is essentially free after installationSafe; large windmill farms consume much landUseful for homes, but not for transportationHydro- electricRenewable; turbines in dams produce electricityLarger rivers tend to be in fl atter areasNew sites are remote or protected in parks and wilderness areasDams are very expensive to build; energy is essen-tially free thereafterSafe; dams destroy habitats and eventually ll with siltUseful for home use, but not for transportationSolarEnergy from the sun is tapped by solar panels and solar cellsAbundant in portions of the country with clear skiesWidespread but diffuse source of energySolar cells are very expen- sive, but energy is free once they are installedSafe; large solar collectors occupy landUseful for homes but not industry c07.indd 133 4:55:14 PM 5/9/08 4:55:14 PM134 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science a review of contradictory data is used to identify them: Misconception: An object at rest has no energy Contradictory data: Automobiles at rest can accelerate with no outside force. Correct explanation: An object at rest has no kinetic energy, but it may have energy in other forms, such as thermal, gravitational potential or, in this case, chemical potential energy in the gasoline. Misconception: Doubling the speed of an object doubles its kinetic energy Contradictory data: The braking distance for a car traveling at 20 miles per hour is 6 m, while the braking distance at twice the speed (40 mi per hour) is 24 m, four times as far. Correct explanation: The kinetic energy of an object increases as the square of the velocity ( E k /H11005 1/2 mv 2 ). Misconception: Rockets accelerate as expanding gases push on matter behind them Contradictory data: Rockets adjust the orbits of satellites in the vacuum of space. Correct explanation: Rockets accelerate in the direction opposite of expanding exhaust gases according to the law of the conservation of momentum. Misconception: Weight is the same thing as mass Contradictory data: Astronauts in space are weightless but still have inertia, a property of mass. Correct explanation: Weight is a measure of the force of gravity on mass. An object can have mass and be weightless if the net force acting on it is 0. Unfortunately, people confuse the terms and state their \" weight \" in kilograms (a unit of mass) rather than in newtons (a unit of force). Misconception: Acceleration always occurs in the same direction as an object is moving Contradictory data: Newton ' s second law states that F /H11005 ma, where F represents force, m rep- resents mass, and a represents acceleration. The force of friction on tires during braking is opposite the direction of motion; therefore, the acceleration must also be in the opposite direction. Correct explanation: Acceleration is always in the direction of the net force, which may or may not be in the direction of movement. ACTIVITY 7.4.1 Clarifying Misconceptions in Physics Note to teacher: Following is a list of common mis- conceptions in physics. Give one misconception to each student, and instruct the class to research the misconception, explain why it is wrong by reason-ing from observed facts and experiences, and pro-vide a correct explanation: The rst item is an example: 1 . Misconception: Electrical charge is used up as it fl ows through a circuit. Correct explanation: Many analogies are made between plumb-ing systems and electrical systems, and this may create some confusion if the analogies Table 7.4 Sample Decision-Making Matrix for Pollution Control Policies Revenue GeneratedReduction in PollutionEffect on Local Economy Score Credit Penalties Tax 134 c07.indd 134 5/9/08 4:55:15 PM 5/9/08 4:55:15 PMThinking Critically and Resolving Misconceptions 135 are taken too far. In plumbing systems, water is consumed and must be replenished, but in circuits, the electrons remain in the wire and cycle when an electromotive force is applied. 2 . Misconception: Charge fl ows through circuits at the speed of light. 3 . Misconception: Red light is most energetic, and blue light is least energetic. 4 . Misconception: We are running out of energy. 5 . Misconception: Sonic booms occur only at the moment when the sound barrier is punctured. 6 . Misconception: Centrifugal force pushes riders into the walls of turning cars or banking roller coasters. 7 . Misconception: The sky is blue because it refl ects the color of the ocean. 8 . Misconception: Vacuum cleaners suction (pull) up debris from the carpet. 9 . Misconception: Warmer objects have more heat than cooler objects. 1 0 . Misconception: Rays of sunlight that hit the Earth are parallel. 1 1 . Misconception: Electric companies sell electric charge that fl ows to consumers. 1 2 . Misconception: The primary colors of light are red, blue, and yellow. 1 3 . Misconception: When white light passes through a colored lter, the lter adds color to the light. 1 4 . Misconception: Gravity is a strong force. 1 5 . Misconception: Infrared light is a kind of heat radiation. 1 6 . Misconception: Energy and force are the same thing. 1 7 . Misconception: Velocity is another word for speed. 1 8 . Misconception: If an object has zero velocity, it has zero acceleration 1 9 . Misconception: The effects of light are instan - taneous. 2 0 . Misconception: Gamma rays, x - rays, ultraviolet light, visible light, infrared light, microwaves, and radio waves are all very different entities. 2 1 . Misconception: When two pulses or waves that are traveling in opposite directions meet, they bounce off each other. 2 2 . Misconception: More massive objects fall faster. 2 3 . Misconception: The more mass in a pendulum bob, the faster it swings. 2 4 . Misconception: All metals are attracted to a magnet. 2 5 . Misconception: As waves move, matter moves along with them. 7.5 Misconceptions in Chemistry People ' s perception of chemistry is infl uenced by the media. Movies have often pictured chemists as mad scientists ( Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, 1931) or as crazy professors ( Absent - Minded Professor, 1961, Flubber, 1997). Unfortunately, very few people can accurately explain what chemistry is or what chemists do. It is no wonder, therefore, that mis-conceptions about chemical principles abound. Following are a few common misconceptions, each with contradictory data that can be used to disprove the misconception and arrive at the cor-rect explanation: Misconception: Fluid pressure acts only downward Contradictory data: Y ou feel pressure in both ears when swimming deep in the water, regard less of the way your head is positioned. Correct explanation: This misconception probably comes from diagrams with arrows showing the downward pressure of the atmosphere or ocean on objects below. According to Pascal ' s princi-ple, all points at the same depth in a fl uid expe- rience the same pressure. If, for example, you release a Styrofoam cup from a bathyscaphe deep in the ocean, it will not fl atten like a pan- cake; rather, it will shrink equally in all dimen-sions so that it is a tiny replica of the original. Misconception: Ice is always at zero degrees Celsius (32 F) Contradictory data: The coldest temperature recorded on Earth is /H11002 129 degrees Fahrenheit at Vostok, Antarctica. How can ice in Vostok remain a warm 32 F (161 degrees warmer) without an external heat source? c07.indd 135 Sourcebook for Teaching Science Correct explanation: Although the temperature of ice can vary widely, the temperature of ice water (where solid ice is in equilibrium with liquid water) is stable at 0 C. The temperature of ice water is widely known, and scientists calibrate temperature probes to 0 C by plac-ing them in ice water. This familiarity with ice water probably leads to the misconception about ice. Solid ice, however, can be colder than 0 C if the environment is colder. Misconception: Heat rises Contradictory data: Heat is de ned as a form of energy arising from the random motion of the molecules of bodies. It is not matter and therefore cannot rise or fall. Correct explanation: Heat can be transferred by conduction, convection, or radiation. Warmer fl uids rise above cooler fl uids, carrying heat energy with them. The molecules in warmer fl uids are more energetic and widely spaced than those in cool fl uids. As a result, cooler fl uids are below warmer fl uids (warmer fl uids rise). Misconception: Organic farmers use organic chemicals Contradictory data: Organic growers market their produce as \" all natural, \" but organic chemi-cals, such as synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides, are manufactured. Correct explanation: The adjective organic indicates that something was derived from living matter. Organic farmers use fertilizers derived from liv-ing matter such as manure and sh meal and manage pests using biological controls. The term organic chemistry refers to carbon - based chem- istry. This term was derived from the fact that nearly all synthetic carbon - based chemicals are derived from petroleum, a product of decayed, compressed vegetation. Organic farmers, how-ever, do not use synthetic organic chemicals. ACTIVITY 7.5.1 Clarifying Misconceptions in Chemistry Note to teacher: Following is a list of common mis- conceptions in chemistry. Give one misconception to each student, and instruct the class to research the misconception, explain why it is wrong by rea-soning from observed facts and experiences, and provide a correct explanation. The rst item is an example: 1 . Misconception: Objects fl oat because they are lighter than water. Correct explanation: Objects fl oat if they are buoyed up by a force greater than their own weight (Archimedes principle). Some barges are made of concrete and fl oat well because they displace a greater weight of water than their own weight. Fluids of lower density than water (not lower weight) fl oat on top of water. 2 . Misconception: Wood fl oats, and rocks sink. 3 .

Misconception: Energy is released when bonds are broken. 7.6 Misconceptions in Biology Misconceptions can kill you. One common mis- conception is, \" If a little is good, more is better. \" A little medicine, painkiller, or sedative can relieve symptoms, but too much may cause complica-tions and even death. For example, an excess of sleeping pills (barbiturates) has led to the death of many celebrities, including rock and roll stars Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix, and Brian Jones (Rolling Stones) and movie star Marilyn Monroe. Many misconceptions are propagated because they seem logical. For example, many believe that you can treat frostbite (injury to ngers, toes, ears, and other body tissues due to exposure to extreme cold) by drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, and not drinking water. This seems logical since alco-hol makes one feel warm, cigarettes bring hot air into the lungs, and water is generally cool. However, medical experts say that alcohol reduces shivering (the body ' s way of generating friction to keep tissues warm), nicotine (the addictive substance in tobacco) slows circulation, and dehydration (insuf cient body water) reduces blood fl ow to endangered tissues. Thus, a person suffering frostbite, a person should drink water but should not smoke or drink alcohol. Following are a few common misconceptions, each with contradictory data that can be used to disprove the misconception and arrive at the cor-rect explanation: Misconception: Cold, wet weather cau- ses the fl u Contradictory data: Infl uenzas are caused by viruses. Viruses live and reproduce within the cells of host organisms, not within cold, wet rain. Correct explanation: People believe that cold, wet weather causes the fl u because people often get sick during this type of weather. It is true to say that infl uenza is correlated with this type of weather but incorrect to say that it is caused by it. People tend to stay inside more during this type of weather and therefore are more likely to come in contact with others, who may be infected. Although the weather does not cause the fl u, people may be more susceptible if they are chilled. Misconception: Plant mass comes from the water and minerals that plants obtain from the soil Contradictory data: One would expect plants to sink into the soil if their entire mass was drawn from the minerals and water withdrawn from the soil. However, there are not depres-sions around trees or bushes, suggesting that this explanation is fl awed. Correct explanation: Although plants absorb and retain water and minerals from the soil, the majority of plant mass is made of cellulose and other carbon - based molecules. Most plant mass is obtained from atmospheric carbon dioxide as carbon is xed into sugars during the process of photosynthesis. Misconception: People use only 10 per- cent of their brains Contradictory data: Positron emission tom- ography (PET scan) and functional mag-netic resonance imaging (fMRI) show activity in all parts of the brain, although not simultaneously. c07.indd 137 c07.indd 137 5/9/08 4:55:16 PM Sourcebook for Teaching Science Correct explanation: The 10 percent myth is fre- quently quoted by psychics and other who exploit people ' s ignorance and offer ways of tapping into the \" unused 90 percent \" of the brain. We use different portions and pathways of the brain for different functions, so it is impossible to say precisely what percentage of the brain we use at any time. Misconception: Only meat, sh, and eggs have protein Contradictory data: DNA is transcribed to RNA, which is translated into proteins. All life is based on DNA; therefore, all living systems must produce proteins. Correct explanation: All cells manufacture pro- tein. Proteins provide structure and serve as enzymes and hormones essential for bio-logical processes. Certain foods have a higher percentage of proteins than other foods. For example, meats have a high percentage of pro-teins because they come from muscular tissue, which is composed primarily of two proteins, actin and myosin. Misconception: There is a start and an end to the food chain Contradictory data: If this were true, all nutrients would end up at the end of the food chain and there would be none available for new life. Correct explanation: Decomposers, primarily fungi and bacteria, break down all life forms, includ-ing those at the top of the food web, and return nutrients to the soil, water, and air, where they are used by primary producers. If there were no decomposers, the vast majority of carbon and other nutrients would be locked up in dead organisms and unavailable for further life. ACTIVITY 7.6.1 Clarifying Misconceptions in Biology Note to teacher: Following is a list of common mis- conceptions in biology. Give one misconception to each student, and instruct the class to research the misconception, explain why it is wrong by reason-ing from observed facts and experiences, and pro-vide a correct explanation. The rst item is an example: 1 . Misconception: Worry and stress turn hair gray. Correct explanation: The graying of hair is a genetic phenomenon. Melanocytes, the cells that produce the pigments in the hair, stop producing pigments at different times in dif-ferent people as a result of genetics, not stress. 2 . Misconception: If you cross your eyes, they may get stuck. 3 . Misconception: Y our heart stops when you sneeze. 4 . Misconception: Heartburn is in your heart. 5 . Misconception: Chemicals are bad for you. 6 . Misconception: Plants respire only at night. 7 . Misconception: Daughters inherit their physi- cal characteristics from their mothers and sons from their fathers. 8 . Misconception: All deciduous trees are an- giosperms. 9 . Misconception: The most abundant phenotype in a population represents the dominant trait. 1 0 . Misconception: All plant shoots are photo- tropic (they grow toward light). 11. Misconception: When lemmings are overpopu- lated, they commit suicide by running off cliffs into the ocean . 1 2 . Misconception: Anaerobic respiration takes place only when there is no air. 1 3 . Misconception: The heart is on the left side of the body. 1 4 . Misconception: All plants are photosynthetic. 1 5 . Misconception: The stomach occupies most of your abdomen. 1 6 . Misconception: Food enters the blood stream from the stomach. 17. Misconception: Alcohol is a stimulant. 18. Misconception: The cornea is simply a window to the eye, and the lens alone focuses light. 19. Misconception: Arteries carry oxygenated blood, and veins carry deoxygenated blood. 20. Misconception: Muscles contract and expand to cause motion. 21. Misnomers: A misnomer is a misleading name. Explain why the following are misnomers. Example: juvenile diabetes: Both children and adults may have either type 1 ( \" juvenile \" ) or type 2 diabetes. c07.indd 138 PM 5/9/08 4:55:17 PMThinking Critically and Resolving Misconceptions 139 a. adult stem cells b. peanuts c. coconut d. poison oak e. seagrass f. pinenuts g. abscissic acid h. dark reactions i. century plant j. koala bear k. star sh l. bald eagle m . refl ies n. heartburn o. killer whale p. sea monkey q. seahorse r . j e l l y sh s. junk DNA t. spongy bone u. fast metabolism 7.7 Misconceptions in Earth and Space Science What is wrong with this sentence? \" A t sunset we sat motionless, pondering the mysteries of the dark side of the Moon, when a shooting star passed by the evening star. \" Although this statement is easily understood, it is lled with error. We can never be motionless because we are on the surface of the Earth, which is spinning rapidly on its axis as it orbits the Sun, which is itself in motion. The Sun never sets but simply disappears from view as the Earth rotates. There is no \" dark side \" to the Moon. We never see the far side of the Moon because the Moon rotates on its axis at the same rate it orbits the Earth so that the same side always faces us. The \" dark side \" is exposed to sunlight whenever the side facing us is dark. Shooting stars (meteors) are glow-ing pieces of rock and dust and bear no resem-blance to stars other than that they emit light. The evening star is actually the planet Venus, not a star at all. Finally, the meteor was millions of miles in front of the evening star and did not pass \" by \" it. Many of our misconceptions are rooted in experience. From our frame of reference, it makes sense to talk about sunrise and sunset, for we have no sensation of the Earth ' s rotation. It certainly seems as if we are standing still because we don ' t experience any wind or feeling of acceleration or movement. Figure 7.3 is a photograph I took while backpacking in California ' s Sierra Nevada Mountains. The shutter was left open for a few hours, allowing starlight to expose Mount Lyell. The stars appear to be moving in an arc from right to left, and in the absence of other knowledge of astronomy, it is fair to conclude that the stars, like the Sun, rotate around the Earth. In reality, the Earth is spinning on its axis, creating the appar-ent motion of the stars. The line traveling at right angles to the stars was created by a satellite, and it is the only object in the photograph that is orbit-ing the Earth. Research studies have shown that many people share the same misconceptions about the universe. For example, a large percentage of people believe that we experience summer at the point in our Figure 7.3 Time Exposure of Stars c07.indd 139 c07.indd 139 5/9/08 4:55:17 PM 5/9/08 4:55:17 PM140 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science orbit where we are closest to the Sun (perihelion) and winter when we are farthest from the Sun (aphelion). This makes sense based on our experi-ence with other luminous objects. We feel warmer when we approach a camp re and colder when we move away from it. However, our concept is chal-lenged when we look at additional data. For exam-ple, the Southern Hemisphere experiences winter when the Northern Hemisphere experiences sum-mer. How can two parts of the world experience different seasons if seasonality is based solely on proximity to the Sun? Diagrams can help clarify misconceptions but may also be the source of misconceptions. Figure 7.4 is designed to show the reasons for the seasons. The earth is tilted 23.5 degrees on its axis, so on December 21, relatively little light hits the Northern Hemisphere, while much hits the Southern Hemi-sphere. December 21 is the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and the longest in the Southern Hemisphere. These factors explain why it is colder in the Northern Hemisphere on this day than it is in the Southern Hemisphere. Although the diagram helps explain seasons, it can also lead to some confusion. For example, the scale of the diagram is very misleading and does not rep-resent the relative size of the Earth and Sun or the distance of the Earth from the Sun. If it were drawn to scale, the Earth would appear as a tiny spec on the ellipse. Following are a few common misconceptions in earth and space sciences, each with contradic-tory data that can be used to disprove the miscon-ception and arrive at the correct explanation: Misconception: Space is a zero - gravity environment Contradictory data: The Moon is in space, and yet gravity is suf cient to cause it to orbit the Earth. Correct explanation: Astronauts experience weightlessness not because they are in space but because they are in orbit around the Earth. They are in a continual state of free fall toward the center of the Earth, but because they also have a tangential velocity, they orbit the Earth rather than plunge toward it. Misconception: Gravity is a strong force Contradictory data: A small magnet can raise a paper clip against the force of gravity, even though the Earth is far more massive than the magnet. Correct explanation: The gravitational attrac- tion between protons is a factor of 1/10 36 the strength of electromagnetic repulsion. The gravitational attraction or repulsion of pro-tons and electrons is negligible compared to electrostatic attraction or repulsion. Although gravity is such a weak force, it is the main force between celestial bodies, because planets and stars do not carry any net charge and are there-fore electrically neutral. Gravity dominates the universe, although it is an extremely weak force. If the strong nuclear force is assigned a strength of 1, the strength of the electromag-netic force is 1 /H11003 10 /H11002 2 , and the strength of the weak nuclear force is 1 /H11003 10 /H11002 1 3 , then the strength of gravity is 1 /H11003 10 /H11002 3 8 . Sun December 21March 20 September 22June 21 Figure 7.4 Earth's Orbit Around the Sun c07.indd 140 and Resolving Misconceptions 141 Misconception: The \" greenhouse effect \" is a bad thing Contradictory data: Without greenhouse heat- ing, the Earth ' s average temperature would be about /H11002 73 C ( /H11002 100 F), cold enough to freeze even the oceans. Correct explanation: The greenhouse effect is the process in which the atmosphere warms a planet. Infrared radiation emitted from the Earth is captured by greenhouse gases, warm-ing the atmosphere and keeping temperatures reasonable for life. Although the greenhouse effect is essential for life, the release of exces-sive greenhouse gases by human activity, par-ticularly carbon dioxide released from the combustion of fossil fuels, is believed to con-tribute to global warming, a potentially devas-tating trend. Misconception: The Coriolis effect causes water in drains to rotate clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere Contradictory data: In the same house, water in a kitchen sink may run one way, while water in a bathroom sink runs the other. Correct explanation: Although the Earth rotates eastward (toward the Sun) with constant angular velocity, points on Earth have very different linear speeds. The North and South Poles have a linear speed of 0, while points on the equator travel at nearly 0.5 km per sec-ond. A point on the equator travels 40,075 km (24,900 mi) per day, while points at the poles travel nowhere. When an object moves north or south from the equatorial regions and is not rmly connected to the ground, it main- tains some of its initial eastward velocity as it moves. Objects moving away from the equa-tor veer relative to the more slowly moving Earth beneath them. The reverse happens moving from northern or southern regions (low linear velocity) toward the equator (high linear velocity). This causes currents to move clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere (Figure 7.5 ), but is too small to affect water running down a drain. Surface features, drain geometry, and initial conditions affect the direction of a vortex in a drain. Misconception: A tsunami is a \" tidal wave \" Contradictory data: The tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon on the waters in the oceans. Tsunamis, however, occur at random intervals and are not correlated with the position of the Moon. Correct explanation: A tsunami is a series of waves formed when a massive amount of water is dis-placed by an earthquake or volcano. Tsunamis are frequently called tidal waves because they resemble a violent rushing tide as they approach land. But they are not related to the Moon or to tides, so oceanographers say that the term tidal wave is very misleading and should not be used. ACTIVITY 7.7.1 Clarifying Misconceptions in Earth and Space Science Note to teacher: Following are a few common mis- conceptions, each with contradictory data that can be used to disprove the misconception and arrive at the correct explanation: The rst item is an example: 1 . Misconception: The Great Wall of China is the only man - made object that can be seen from the Moon. Correct explanation: No manmade objects are visible from the Moon, and astro-nauts note that the Great Wall of China dis-appears from view earlier than more massive man - made structures such as highways, cit-ies, and large ships. The Great Wall of China is much narrower than modern highways, and counterclockwiseclockwise equator Figure 7.5 Ocean Currents Caused in Part by the Coriolis Effect c07.indd 141 PM142 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science if such roads cannot be seen from space, then neither would the Great Wall of China. 2 . Misconception: It is possible to balance eggs on end on the vernal equinox. 3 . Misconception: There is a dark side of the Moon. 4 . Misconception: Stars twinkle because they are on re. 5 . Misconception: The tail of a comet travels behind it as it moves. 6 . Misconception: Planets traveling closest to the Sun travel slowest because they have the small-est orbits. 7 . Misconception: The Moon orbits the center of mass of the Earth. 8 . Misconception: Raindrops are shaped like teardrops. 9 . Misconception: Polaris (the North Star) has always been in the direction of true north. 1 0 . Misconception: A magnetic compass always points north. 1 1 . Misconception: The north end of a com- pass needle points to the Earth ' s magnetic North Pole. 1 2 . Misconception: Rivers fl ow south. 1 3 .

Misconception: Shadows don ' t exist on overcast days because the Sun is not bright enough. 1 9 . Misconception: Clouds, fog, and steam are water vapor. 2 0 . Misconception: The phases of the Moon are due to the shadow of the Earth. 2 1 . Misconception: The stars of a constellation are near each other. 2 2 .

Answers to Chapter Activities 7.1.1 Students will construct data comparison tables. 7.1.2 Sudoku puzzles require many of the critical thinking skills on the list. Players must examine problems care-fully, look at all evidence, reject incorrect information, and suspend judgment until suf cient facts have been considered. Encourage students to explain speci c strategies with their peers through a pair - share activity. Answers are found in Figure 7.6 . 7.2.1 - 7.2.3 Student projects and responses will vary. 7.3.1 Students complete the decision - making matrix and write a persuasive essay for the fuel source that ranks highest. Y ou may wish to encourage students to use additional resources as they write their essays. 7.3.2 Students will generate decision - making matrices. Some categories may be much more important than oth-ers, and students should be encouraged to weight the scores of the more important columns more heavily. 7.4.1 Clarifying misconceptions in physics: The misconcep- tion is followed by the correct explanation. 1. Electrical charge is used up as it fl ows through a circuit. Correct explanation: Answer provided in activity section. 2. Charge fl ows through circuits at the speed of light. Correct explanation: Electric elds propagate at nearly the speed of light in electric circuits as electrons begin to move. The electrons themselves move rather slowly. The theory of relativity ( E /H11005 mc 2 , where c /H11005 3.0 /H11003 10 8 m/s) indicates that far too much energy is required to move electrons at the speed of light. 3. Red light is most energetic and blue light least ener- getic. Correct explanation: Students grow up associat-ing red with hot and blue with cold. Labels on faucets and diagrams reinforce this association. The energy of electromagnetic radiation is proportional to fre-quency E /H11005 hf, i h is Planck ' s constant 6.6 /H11003 10 /H11002 34 Js. Blue light (7 /H11003 10 14 Hz) has a higher frequency than red light (4 /H11003 10 14 Hz), and therefore higher energy. 4. We are running out of energy. Correct explanation: Energy is not destroyed but converted to less useful forms, such as heat and sound. As a civilization, we are depleting usable energy sources, notably the chemical potential energy within fossil fuels. As these fuels are burned, energy is released in less usable forms as heat, light, sound, and motion. 5. Sonic booms occur only the moment when the sound barrier is punctured. Correct explanation: Sonic booms are heard whenever an object is exceeding the speed of sound. Stationary observers hear it only once as the shock wave moves past them. 6. Centrifugal force pushes riders into the walls of turn- ing cars or banking roller coasters. Correct explana-tion: Centrifugal force (meaning \" center fl eeing \" ) is a ctitious force that appears when one is in a rotat- ing frame of reference like a roller coaster or a turning car. It appears as though there is a force pushing the rider away from the center of rotation. However, when viewed from an inertial frame of reference, one sees c07.indd 142 c07.indd 142 4:55:24 PM 5/9/08 4:55:24 PMThinking Critically and Resolving Misconceptions 143 that the passenger ' s inertia resists acceleration, and the walls of the car push on the passenger. 7. The sky is blue because it refl ects the color of the ocean. Correct explanation: The sky appears blue because gases in the atmosphere scatter blue light more than the other colors (Rayleigh scattering). Oceans and lakes appear blue on sunny days as they refl ect the color of the sky. Note that the ocean and lakes appear gray on overcast days. 8. Vacuum cleaners suction (pull) up debris from the carpet. Correct explanation: Suction is a ctitious force. Vacuum cleaners create a low - pressure zone, and atmospheric pressure outside pushes debris into them. Suction implies pulling, but there is no medium to pull with. Solids can be pulled; gases cannot be. 9. Warmer objects have more heat than cooler objects. Correct explanation: T emperature is a measure of the intensity of energy, and heat is a measure of the extent of energy. A cold ocean has much more energy than a warm cup of coffee even though the coffee has a higher temperature. This misconception arises because people use the terms interchangeably in everyday language. We say \" it is a hot day \" or that \" we don ' t enjoy the heat. \" Instead, we should say \" the temperature is high today \" or that \" we don ' t enjoy high temperatures. \" 10. All rays of sunlight that hit the Earth are parallel. Correct explanation: Light rays from distant stars are essentially parallel because they emanate from point sources, but light rays from the Sun are not because the Sun has observable dimensions. Light rays from one side of the Sun cross those emanating from the other side. Most textbooks describe light rays from the Sun as parallel, and they are close enough to parallel for purposes of focusing light to a small dot with a hand lens. 11. Electric companies sell electric charge that fl ows to consumers. Correct explanation: Electric companies sell energy delivered by alternating current (AC). In AC, the electrons move back and forth over small dis-tances, generating an electric eld the length of the wire. Electric companies charge per kilowatt - hour, which is a measure of energy, not a measure of charge. If electric companies sold charge, they would charge per coulomb, not per kilowatt - hour. 12. The primary colors of light are red, blue, and yellow. Correct explanation: The primary colors of light are red, green, and blue. All computer monitors and TV monitors are composed of red, green, and blue pixels that can be used to create a variety of colors when stim-ulated to varying degrees. The retinas in our eyes con-tain photoreceptive cones that detect red, green, and blue light, and hence these are the primary colors for purposes of human vision. Students often think that blue, red, and yellow are the primary colors because they learned in art class that you can make all colors Figure 7.6 Solutions to Sudoku Puzzles c07.indd 143 Sourcebook for Teaching Science by mixing these pigments in varying degrees. Actually, cyan, magenta, and yellow are the three primary colors of pigments, as refl ected in the c/m/y toner and ink cartridges of printers. Cyan (a bluish color), magenta (a reddish color), and yellow pigments can be mixed to give a variety of colors in print media. However, pigments act in a subtractive manner to produce new colors, whereas light acts in an additive fashion. 13. When white light passes through a colored lter, the l- ter adds color to the light. Correct explanation: Filters remove all colors but the ones they transmit or refl ect. A red lter removes all light but red. 14. Gravity is a strong force. Correct explanation: Gravity is an extremely weak force, but it is signi cant because there is so much mass through which it acts. The comparative weakness of gravity is demonstrated by the ease with which a small magnet using electromagnetic force can lift an iron nail against the full gravitational pull of the Earth. 15. Infrared light is a kind of heat radiation. Correct expla- nation: Infrared light was discovered when William Herschell noticed that the zone beyond red light in a spectrum could heat surfaces. In fact, all forms of vis-ible lights, not just infrared, can heat surfaces. People link infrared with heat because objects at room temper- ature emit radiation in the mid - infrared region. Electric heaters feel hot because they are \" extremely bright \" in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. 16. Energy and force are the same thing. Correct explana- tion: Energy is the capacity to do work, and work is the application of a force through a distance, so energy and force are related, but not synonymous. 1 7 . Velocity is another word for speed. Correct explana- tion: Speed is the rate of movement measured in dis-tance per unit of time, whereas velocity is the speed in a given direction. Velocity is a vector quantity; speed is scalar quantity. Students confuse these terms because they often hear them incorrectly used interchangeably. 18. If an object has zero velocity, it has zero acceleration. Correct explanation: Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. A thrown football experiences an accel-eration of 1 g (9.8 m/s 2 ) toward the Earth from the moment it is thrown. At the top of its parabolic fl ight it has a vertical velocity of 0 m/s but is still accelerating toward the Earth at 9.8 m/s 2 . 19. The effects of light are instantaneous. Correct expla- nation: Light has a measurable speed (3.0 /H11003 10 8 m/s in a vacuum) but travels so fast that its effects appear instantaneous over short distances. It takes light approximately 8.3 seconds to travel 93 million miles from the Sun to Earth. 20. Gamma rays, X - rays, ultraviolet light, visible light, infrared light, and microwaves and radio waves are all very different entities. Correct explanation: All of these are forms of electromagnetic radiation and vary only in their frequency ( f /H11005 /H9261 /H11002 1 ). People regard them as different entities because they have such different applications. For example, radio waves are used for communication, light for vision, and X - rays for medi- cal diagnostics. Nonetheless, they are all variations of the same phenomenon. 21. When two pulses or waves, traveling in opposite directions meet, they bounce off each other. Correct explanation: Waves refl ect off surfaces, leading some to believe that they refl ect off each other. However, sound, light, water, and mechanical (on a string or rope) waves travel through each other, unaffected by one another. 22. More massive objects fall faster. Correct explanation: All objects accelerate under gravity at the same rate in a vacuum. However, less dense objects are generally affected more by air resistance than denser or more streamlined objects, and hence they fall slower in the atmosphere. Misconceptions arise when one does not de ne the environmental parameters. 23. The more mass in a pendulum bob, the faster it swings. Correct explanation: The period (T) of a pendulum is dependent on length (L) but independent of mass (m). T /H11005 2 /H9266 (L/g) 1/2 . People often think that more massive pendulums fall faster for the same reason that they believe heavier objects fall fast er than lighter objects. The timing of grandfather clocks is adjusted by changing the length of the pendulum rather than changing its mass. 24. All metals are attracted to a magnet. Correct expla- nation: Not all metals are attracted to magnets. Aluminum, copper, lead, gold, and silver are examples of metals that are not attracted to a magnet. 25. As waves move, matter moves along with them. Correct explanation: This misconception is derived by watching the surf at the ocean. It appears as though water from far out in the ocean is pushed ashore. Although currents move water laterally, waves do not, except when they crash on the shore. Waves transmit energy without transmitting matter. The energy released in an earthquake is transmit-ted through the Earth to seismographs around the world without the transmission of matter. Similarly, energy is transmitted by light without the transmission of matter. 7.5.1 Clarifying misconceptions in chemistry: The miscon- ception is followed by the correct explanation: 1. Objects fl oat because they are lighter than water. Correct explanation: Answer provided in activity section. 2 . W o o d fl oats and rocks sink. Correct explanation: Some woods have a density greater than water (1.00 g/ml) and sink: lignum and ebony (1.12 g/ml) are examples. Some rocks, such as pumice (a volcanic rock with trapped gases), have a density less than water and fl oat. 3. Liquids in straws and pipettes rise due to suc- tion. Correct explanation: Suction does not exist. Liquids and gases cannot be pulled because they do not have tensile strength. Straws and pipettes work because a person or bulb creates a low - pressure zone. Atmospheric pressure outside pushes the fl uid up the tube because of this pressure differential. 4. The maximum temperature that water can be is 100 C. Correct explanation: The boiling point is the c07.indd 144 c07.indd 144 4:55:27 PM 5/9/08 4:55:27 PMThinking Critically and Resolving Misconceptions 145 temperature at which vapor pressure is equal to the surrounding air pressure. The boiling point can be raised far above 100 C by sealing the container, as is done in a pressure cooker in which liquid water reaches temperatures far in excess of 100 C. 5. The bubbles in boiling water are made of air or oxy- gen. Correct explanation: A liquid boils when its vapor pressure is equal to the surrounding atmospheric pres-sure. The bubbles in boiling water are gaseous water, not air or oxygen. 6. Electrons fl ow at the speed of light in copper wires. Correct explanation: Electrons travel only a few mil-limeters per second in copper wires. When a switch is opened or closed, the change in potential difference moves at nearly the speed of light. 7. Cations are positive because they have gained protons. Correct explanation: Cations are positive because they have lost negatively charged electrons. Losing a nega-tive charge leaves the atom with a net positive charge. 8. Iron and steel are the only strongly ferromagnetic mate- rials. Correct explanation: Strong permanent magnets can be made of neodymium, cobalt - samarium, and other materials. 9. The faster a fl uid moves, the higher its pressure is. Correct explanation: Bernoulli ' s principle states that a decrease in pressure occurs simultaneously with an increase in velocity. The faster a fl uid moves, the lower its pressure is. 10. All radioactivity is man - made. Correct explanation: Natural radioactivity is common in the rocks and soil that makes up our planet, water, and oceans (deuterium and tritium), and in building materials and buildings themselves. 11. Thermal expansion is due to the expansion of particles of matter. Correct explanation: Atoms do not expand when heated, but the spacing of atoms does increase according to the kinetic theory. The energy and speed of atoms or molecules increase as the temperature rises, causing them to spread out. 12. Electrons orbit the nucleus like planets around a sun. Correct explanation: The solar system model is inconsistent with principles of quantum mechanics. Chemists prefer to discuss electron clouds as zones where electrons are likely to be. 13. The metric system is more accurate than the other measurement systems. Correct explanation: The met-ric system is easier to use than the customary (English) system but not more accurate or precise. 14. Heat and temperature are the same. Correct explana- tion: T emperature is an intrinsic property of matter (dependent only on intensity), while heat is an exten-sive property (dependent on the extent or amount of matter). The ocean may have the same temperature as a glass of water, but it has much greater energy. 15. There are 92 naturally occurring elements on Earth. Correct explanation: Since uranium (element 92) is the largest naturally occurring element, many people assume that elements 1 to 91 also occur in nature. However, there are no stable isotopes of technetium (element 43) and promethium (element 61). 16. Solids are completely solid and contain no space. Correct explanation: Atoms are mostly space, and so all liquids, solids, and gases must also be mostly space. It is estimated that if the space between electrons and the nucleus of atoms could be removed, the entire mass of the Earth would collapse to size of a basketball. 17. Air has no mass. Correct explanation: Air is made of mat- ter (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, argon, and so forth) and therefore has mass. The density of air at sea level is approximately 1/800th the density of water (1.25 kg/m 3 ). 18. Rusting iron does not change weight. Correct explana- tion: Iron combines with oxygen to produce iron oxide or rust. The addition of oxygen causes the mass and weight to increase. 19. Drops on the outside of a cold container are due to leakage. Correct explanation: The drops on the out-side of a cold container are the result of the conden-sation of atmospheric water vapor. The higher the relative humidity is, the greater the condensation. 20. Chemical reactions continue until all the reactants are exhausted. Correct explanation: Chemical reac-tions reach equilibrium when the rate of the forward reactions is equal to the rate of the reverse reactions. In some reactions, the initial forward rate may greatly exceed the reverse rate, giving the misimpression that all of the reactants are exhausted. 21. Endothermic reactions are never spontaneous. Correct explanation: Change in free energy ( /H9004 G), not the change in enthalpy ( /H9004 H), determines the spontaneity of a reac- tion. Reactions are spontaneous whenever there is a release in free energy ( /H9004 G is negative); Gibbs free energy is composed of enthalpy and entropy as seen in the equa-tion when increase in entropy ( /H9004 S) is suf ciently large. In other words, a reaction is spontaneous when /H9004 G is negative, which occurs in endothermic reactions only when the magnitude of T /H9004S is greater than /H9004 H. 22. Combustion reactions are endothermic because energy must be added before they will occur. Correct explana-tion: A reaction is exothermic whenever there is a net release of energy. Activation energy must be used to ini-tiate combustion reactions, but more energy is released than consumed, so they are considered to be exothermic. 23. The space between electrons and the nucleus is com- posed of air. Correct explanation: There is nothing in the space between electrons and the nucleus of an atom or between atoms or molecules in matter. 24. Oxidation is the addition of oxygen in a reaction. Correct explanation: Oxidation is a reaction in which the oxidation number increases. Oxygen is an excellent oxidizing agent because it removes electrons and causes the oxidation number to increase. Iodine, fl uorine, and bromine are also good oxidizers, but they are less com-mon than oxygen. 4:55:27 PM146 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science 25. Reduction is the removal of oxygen in a reaction. Correct explanation: Reduction occurs whenever the oxidation number is decreased. This may take place when oxygen is removed, but it also takes place in many other equations in which oxygen is not involved. 26. Electrons enter an electrolytic cell at the cathode, travel through the solution, and exit at the anode. Correct explanation: Although the movement of electrons causes a current within metals, the movement of ions causes a current within solutions. 27. Energy is released when bonds are broken. Correct explanation: Energy is always required to break bonds. Energy is released in a reaction if the sum of the bond energies of the products is less than the sum of the bond energies of the reactants. 7.6.1 Clarifying misconceptions in biology: The misconcep- tion is followed by the correct explanation. 1. Worry and stress turn hair gray. Correct explanation: Answer provided in activity section. 2. If you cross your eyes, they may get stuck. Correct explanation: Crossing the eyes is a voluntary motion, and the muscles will fatigue and return to their normal positions as other voluntary muscles do. 3. Y our heart stops when you sneeze. Correct explanation: Intrathoracic pressure increases while sneezing. This may decrease venous blood fl ow to the heart, resulting in a slight change of the breathing rate, but it does not stop the electrical and muscular activity of the heart. 4. Heartburn is in your heart. Correct explanation: Heartburn is a form of indigestion that causes a burn-ing sensation in the chest. It is the result of acid regur-gitation from the stomach into the esophagus. 5. Chemicals are bad for you. Correct explanation: Many chemicals are bad for you, but many are essential. Y our body is composed of myriad chemicals, including car-bohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. 6. Plants respire only at night. Correct explanation: Plants, like animals, respire continuously to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for use in growth, and development. 7. Daughters inherit their physical characteristics from their mothers and sons from their fathers. Correct explanation: A child receives half of his or her genes from each parent. The expression of these genes (phenotype) depends on the ratio of dominant and recessive alleles inherited. 8. All deciduous trees are angiosperms. Correct Some gymnosperms, notably the metasequoia and larch, are deciduous. Most people see only evergreen gymno- sperms such as pine, r, cypress, and spruce, hence, the misconception that all gymnosperms are evergreens. 9. The most abundant phenotype in a population rep- resents the dominant trait. Correct explanation: Dom-inance refers to the expression of a gene, not its abundance. A good example of a rare dominant char-acteristic is pseudoachondroplasia, a type of dwar sm. Although the gene is rare, it is dominant and phenotyp-ically expressed in all offspring who contain the gene. 10. All plant shoots are phototropic (grow toward light). Correct explanation: The tendrils of vines are negatively phototropic. This causes them to grow toward walls, rocks, and branches for support. 11. When lemmings are overpopulated, they commit suicide by running off cliffs into the ocean. Correct explanation: Lemming populations, like those of many other rodents, periodically exhibit dramatic growth and decline, but this is due primarily to migration and disease. The lemming myth was probably created to explain population cycles and was popularized in Walt Disney ' s 1958 movie White Wilderness in which movie- makers induced lemmings to jump. 12. Anaerobic respiration takes place only when there is no air. Correct explanation: Anaerobic respiration occurs whenever there is insuf cient oxygen for complete aerobic respiration. The product of anaerobic respira-tion in humans is lactic acid, which may trigger muscle contractions and cramping. 13. The heart is on the left side of the body. Correct expla- nation: The heart is located in the center of the chest, but its left side is larger. The left ventricle pumps to the entire body and is therefore more muscular than the right side, which pumps only to the lungs. 14. All plants are photosynthetic. Correct explanation: A few hundred plant species lack chlorophyll, are para-sitic, and obtain their energy from their hosts. 15. The stomach occupies most of your abdomen. Correct explanation: The stomach is located immediately below the diaphragm. Most of the space in the abdomen is occupied by the intestines. 16. Food enters the bloodstream from the stomach. Correct explanation: Food is chemically and mechani-cally digested in the stomach, but the absorption of nutrients takes place in the intestines. 17. Alcohol is a stimulant. Correct explanation: Alcohol is a sedative and depresses central nervous system functions. 18. The cornea is simply a window to the eye, and the lens alone focuses light. Correct explanation: The cornea is the main lens of the eye. It is more curved than the lens and plays a signi cant role in focusing light on the retina. 19. Arteries carry oxygenated blood, and veins carry deox- ygenated blood. Correct explanation: Arteries carry blood away from the heart, and veins carry blood toward the heart. Pulmonary arteries (those going to the lungs) carry deoxygenated blood, while systemic arteries (those supplying the rest of the body) carry oxygenated blood. Pulmonary veins (those bringing blood from the lungs to the heart) carry oxygenated blood, while sys-temic veins (those bringing blood from the rest of the body to the heart) carry deoxygenated blood. 20. Muscles contract and expand to cause motion. Correct explanation: All motion is caused by muscle contrac-tion, not expansion. Muscles are paired in agonist/antagonist pairs. Agonists contract to cause fl exion or extension, and antagonist muscles contract to counter these motions with extension or fl exion. 21. Misnomers. A misnomer is a misleading name. Explanations of the misnomers follow each term. c07.indd 146 c07.indd 146 5/9/08 4:55:28 and Resolving Misconceptions 147 a. adult stem cells: Adult stem cells are cells that reside in developed tissue but can also be found in infants and children. b. peanuts: Peanuts are legumes, not nuts. c. coconut: Coconuts are fruits, not nuts. d. poison oak: Poison oak is not an oak but a member of the sumac family. e. seagrass: Seagrasses do not belong to the grass family. f. pinenuts: Pinenuts are seeds, not nuts. g. abscissic acid: Abscissic acid is not involved in abscis- sion, but rather the maintenance of dormancy in buds and seeds. h. dark reactions: The \" dark reactions \" of photosynthe- sis (carbon xation) occur during the daytime but do not require light. It is preferable to use the term Calvin cycle reactions. i. century plant: The life cycle of a century plant (Agave) is closer to 35 years than to 100 years. j. koala bear: Koalas belong to the Phascolarctidae, not to the Ursoidae (bear family). k. star sh: Star sh are echinoderms, not sh. l. bald eagle: Bald eagles are not bald; they have white feathers on their head. m . refl ies: Firefl ies are beetles, not fl ies. n. heartburn: Heartburn is due to indigestion and has nothing to do with the heart. o. killer whale: Killer whales (orcas) are members of the dolphin family. p. sea monkey: Sea monkeys are a hybrid form of brine shrimp. q. seahorse: Seahorses are not horses but members of the Syngnathidae. r . j e l l y sh: Jelly sh are coelenterates, not sh. s. junk DNA: Noncoding DNA may be spacer material that allows enzyme complexes to form around func-tional elements more easily. Many other proposed functions have been proposed. t. spongy bone: Spongy bone is actually hard, although it appears spongy in appearance. u. fast metabolism: Metabolism is the sum of catabo- lism (building up) and anabolism (breaking down). It is better to refer to the speed of catabolic or anabolic processes. 7.7.1 Clarify ing misconceptions in earth and space science: The misconception is followed by the correct explanation: 1. The Great Wall of China is the only man - made object that can be seen from the Moon. Correct explanation: Answer provided in activity section. 2. It is possible to balance eggs on end on the vernal equi- nox. Correct explanation: The vernal equinox (gen-erally March 20) and autumnal equinox (generally September 22) are two days of the year when there is an equal length of day and night, but this has no effect on balancing eggs. With considerable practice, it is pos-sible to balance an egg on end any day of the year. 3. There is a dark side of the Moon. Correct explanation: The Moon rotates on its axis as it orbits the Earth such that the same side always faces the Earth. Although we never see the far side of the Moon from Earth, it receives just as much sunlight as the side that faces us. 4. Stars twinkle because they are on re. Correct explana- tion: Light bends, or refracts, when it passes between media of differing optical densities such as the layers of the atmosphere. Turbulence in the atmosphere reposi-tions parcels of air, causing changes in the refraction of light and the consequent twinkling we see when view-ing from Earth. Stars do not appear to twinkle when viewed from space because there is no atmosphere. 5. The tail of a comet travels behind it as it moves. Correct explanation: Although the smoke from a locomotive travels behind a train, the \" tail \" of a comet always fl ows away from the Sun. The trail of smoke from a train is affected by wind resistance, while the \" tail \" of a comet is directed by solar wind and light. Solar wind is com-posed of charged particles that direct the fl uorescing ion tail away from the Sun. Simultaneously, solar radia-tion exerts a pressure on refl ective particles in the dust tail, pushing them away from the Sun (Figure 7.7 ). 6. Planets traveling closest to the Sun travel slowest because they have the smallest orbits. Correct explanation: Kepler ' s second law states that an imaginary line drawn from the center of the Sun to the center of the planet will sweep out equal areas in equal intervals of time. Thus, the closer a planet is to the Sun, the faster it travels. Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun, has the highest orbital speed among the planets. Mercury derived its name because of its speed (in mythology, Mercury was the messenger of the gods). 7. The Moon orbits the center of mass of the Earth. Correct explanation: The Moon and the Earth orbit a point of common gravity that is approximately 1000 km below the Earth ' s surface on a line between the center of mass of the Moon and Earth. 8. Raindrops are shaped like teardrops. Correct expla- nation: The shape of a raindrop is determined by the interaction of surface tension of water and the pres-sure of the air as it falls. In small droplets (1 mm or smaller), raindrops assume a spherical shape, while larger droplets become indented. Water droplets over 4 mm in diameter tend to assume a parachute shape before breaking into smaller drops. The only place one nds the teardrop shape is when water lands on a sur- face and starts to slide, as on a windshield (Figure 7.8 ). Ion tail Dust tail HeadSun Figure 7.7 Comet Tails 147 PM Sourcebook for Teaching Science 9. Polaris (the North Star) has always been in the direction of true north. Correct explanation: The Earth precesses like a wobbling, spinning top. Currently Polaris is within 1 degree of true north, but at other times Thuban, Vega, and Alpha Cephei have held this position. 10. A magnetic compass always points north. Correct explanation: It is believed that the Earth ' s magnetic eld is produced by electric currents in the liquid part of the core. The magnetic pole wanders about 40 m per day, and you may wish to have students plot its move-ment given these historic data: 1831 96.5 1994 104.0 W 78.5 N. True north, however, is on the imaginary line extending from the axis of the Earth and is xed at 90.0 N. 11. The north end of a compass needle points to the Earth ' s magnetic north pole. Correct explanation: The north end of a compass needle is de ned as a north magnetic pole. Opposite magnetic poles attract, and the north pole of the compass is attracted to the Earth ' s south magnetic pole, which happens to be located near the geographical North Pole. We do, however, refer to this as the Magnetic North Pole because it is close to the true North Pole, so confusion is justi ed. 1 2 . R i v e r s fl ow south. Correct explanation: Many of the world ' s largest rivers, most notably the Nile, fl ow north. Rivers fl ow downhill, regardless of the direction. 13. There is an \" up \" and \" down \" in space. Correct expla- nation: The de nitions of up and down are based on our frame of reference. Since we live on the surface of the Earth, \" down \" is toward the geometric center of the Earth, and \" up \" is in the opposite direction. In space, these de nitions are meaningless. 14. Black holes are empty holes in space. Correct expla- nation: A black hole is an extremely small region of space - time with a gravitational eld so strong that not even light can escape. Black holes are the densest objects in the universe and thought to have formed from the collapse of larger stars. 15. All of the planets have solid surfaces. Correct explana- tion: The inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) are rocky. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are gaseous giants, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium and do not have solid surfaces. 16. The Sun is directly overhead at 12 noon. Correct expla- nation: The Earth is tilted 23.5 on its axis, so the Sun will never appear directly overhead north of the tropic of Cancer (23.5 N) or south of the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5 S). Even within this region, it will appear directly overhead at noon on only one or two days a year, and then only if you are in the exact middle of the time zone. Each time zone has a reference longitude where the Sun appears in line with both poles at noon. By de nition, this is in the middle of the time zone. 17. The Sun does not rotate. Correct explanation: The Sun does rotate, but not like a solid planet. The Sun ' s rota-tional period is about 25 days at the equator and about 35 days near the poles. 18. Shadows don ' t exist on overcast days because the Sun is not bright enough. Correct explanation: Shadows are cast by directional lighting. On cloudy days, sunlight is very diffuse, refl ected off water droplets in the clouds. Lighting is much more uniform, and as a result, shad-ows are faint or nonexistent. 19. Clouds, fog, and steam are water vapor. Correct expla- nation: Water vapor is made of molecules too small to be seen. Clouds, fog, and steam are composed of tiny droplets of liquid water. The bubbles of gas in boiling water are water vapor. When water vapor hits cooler air, some condenses as steam. 20. The phases of the Moon are due to the shadow of the Earth. Correct explanation: The phases of the Moon are due to the relative positions of the Sun, Earth, and Moon. A full Moon occurs when the Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth as the Sun. The Moon refl ects its light back to the Earth. A new moon occurs when the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun. The Moon still refl ects light, but back toward the Sun, not toward the Earth. 21. The stars of a constellation are near each other. Correct explanation: A constellation is a group of stars visible from Earth that forms a distinctive pattern. Although the stars appear in the same portion of the sky to us, they are often extremely far from each other and sim-ply in the same direction when viewed from Earth. 22. The Sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Correct explanation: The apparent directions of sunrise and sunset are a function of latitude and the season. On the summer solstice, the Sun never sets when viewed from the North Pole and never rises when viewed from the South Pole. 23. Small earthquakes prevent big ones from happening. Correct explanation: Small earthquakes may relieve stress on a fault line but do not prevent large ones from happening. The energy released in a single magnitude 6 earthquake is nearly 27,000 times as great as in a mag-nitude 3 earthquake. As a result, it would require many small earthquakes to release the energy that causes a large one. 24. Underground streams fl ow just like streams above ground. Correct explanation: Many underground streams seep through permeable rocks and sands rather than fl owing through stream - like underground channels.

An advance organ- izer is information presented prior to the main lesson that the learner uses to organize and inter-pret new information. David Ausubel, a promi-nent educational researcher in the 1960s, believed that the most important determinant of learning is what a learner already knows. 1 He encouraged teachers to introduce new concepts by connecting them to prior knowledge and the new material. Advance organizers can be helpful in the develop-ment of such connections by providing an outline in which learners can place new material in con-text with existing information and see how it will relate to future learning. Much research supports Ausubel ' s contention that advance organizers aid understanding and retention. T eachers routinely use a variety of advance organizers, even if they are unfamiliar with the term. Lesson outlines, KWL charts, SQ3R charts, concept maps, skimming, and gapped handouts are but a few of the advance organizers routinely used in education. Learners organize information in schemas, conceptual patterns in their minds, and advance organizers help structure these schemas so learners can assimilate new information ef ciently. Shopping mall maps are a type of advance organizer. They illustrate the structure of the mall and indicate a shopper ' s current position with a \" you are here \" marker. The shopper is familiar with his c08.indd 151 c08.indd 151 5/9/08 5:57:31 PM 5/9/08 5:57:31 PM152 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science organizers that are commonly used in science edu- cation are KWL charts and the SR3R technique. KWL Charts A popular advance organizer that can be applied to any science class is the KWL chart. With this approach, students work in small groups to com-plete a chart similar to the one shown in Table 8.1 . They rst discuss what they already know (K) about the topic (column 1 in the table). By discussing this among themselves, they are given the opportunity to share their existing knowledge and bring others to a similar point of understanding. Next, they dis-cuss what they want (W) to learn about this topic (column 2). The teacher surveys students ' knowl-edge and interest and adapts the lesson accordingly. After completing the activity or lesson, students report what they have learned (L, column 3). The KWL chart is a good metacognitive activity in which students think about their thinking. SQ3R Charts T extbooks are structured entirely differently from novels, and yet most students read textbooks in a serial fashion, from the rst page in a chapter to the last, the same way they would read a novel. This approach is relatively ineffective because it ignores the organizational structure and study clues given by the author. The SQ3R technique ( S urvey, Q uestion, R ead, R ecite, R eview) is an or her immediate surroundings (prior knowledge) and uses the map (advance organizer) to see how shops of interest (new knowledge) are geographi-cally related to their current position and to one another (interrelation). Similarly, textbook authors often include chapter outlines and highlights at the beginning of chapters, providing students with a map of what they will be learning and how it relates to what they already know. Unfortunately many novice readers ignore such tips, classifying them as superfl uous information akin to similarly format- ted enrichment information that is often sprinkled through their books. Shoppers who use the mall maps are routinely more ef cient with their use of time and gain a better understanding of the mall for future reference. Similarly, students who study advance organizers will be more ef cient in their studies and have a better understanding of the big picture and the interrelatedness of its components. T eachers are encouraged to use advance organ- izers in their curriculum, reading, projects, and lessons to help students develop sound schemata into which new material can be assimilated. In the activities that follow, students are provided oppor-tunities to use classic advance organizers for entire subjects. Advance organizers should be used not only in advance of a lesson but also during the les-son, in much the same way a traveler refers to a map during a trip. Midtrip references to a map ensure that the traveler stays on course, and midstream references to advance organizers ensure that learn-ers don ' t lose sight of the big picture. Two advance Table 8.1 KWL Charts K What do you K now? W What do you W ant to Know? L What have you L earned? Earthquakes occur in California, Japan, and Mexico. The center of an earthquake is known as the epicenter. Earthquake intensity is measured on the Richter scale. Earthquakes result from movement in the Earth ' s crust. No one seems to know when earthquakes will occur. Where are earthquakes likely to occur? How can you tell where the epicenter of an earthquake was? What do Richter scale values mean? What causes earthquakes? Can anyone predict 152 5/9/08 5:57:32 PM 5/9/08 5:57:32 PM Organizing Science Information and Concepts 153 active approach to reading that helps students get the most out of reading science texts by develop-ing a framework prior to reading. Unlike pleasure reading, which by nature is relatively passive, the SQ3R technique is a active approach that requires the readers to apply their mental energies to grasp the concepts. S urvey: Survey the chapter to see its organization and themes before reading. Record the title of the chapter and predict what will be included. Read the introduction or chapter objec-tives, and jot down the key concepts to be discussed. Note the main ideas, which are marked with boldface type or are underlined. Read the summary to understand the rela-tionship between the main ideas. Read the questions at the end of the chapter. These reveal what the author thinks are the most important concepts. Review graphics, charts, and diagrams. Q uestion: Y ou learn and remember best when actively engaged in searching for answers to questions. Turn headings and subheadings into questions. Develop questions for small sections. Add more questions as you proceed to new sections . R ead: Read the chapter once you have developed a framework by the preceding activities. Read one section at a time. Read selectively, focusing your attention on material related to questions you developed. Read small sections at a time. R ecite: Although the second R in the SQ3R tech- nique stands for \" recite, \" the goal is to be more active than during normal recitation. Rather than reciting what the textbook says, readers should try to answer the questions in their own words. Answer questions in your own words. Focus on small sections at a time. Answer questions for the section you have just read. \" Recite \" as you valuable teacher. The review stage of SQ3R gives students the oppor-tunity to review key concepts and build long - term memory. Review all your questions. T est yourself for memory 8.1 Advance Organizers ACTIVITY 8.1.1 Concept of Advance Or gan izers Traf c engineers and transportation agen cies have the responsibility of moving traf c ef ciently and safely. In order to do this, they have devel-oped a series of standard sign shapes, colors, and designs to notify motorists of upcoming hazards and resources. The signs are advance organiz-ers, helping motorists understand things to come and make their plans accordingly. Unfortunately, many people do not pay attention to road signs or memorize their basic shapes, and this may lead to inef cient or dangerous driving. How many of the basic traf c sign designs can you identify?

Research has shown that these advance organizers help students learn and remember new material by developing structures or schemas into which new information can be placed. Sadly, many students ignore these signs and spend much more time reading than necessary, yet with minimal understanding and retention. Before reading a textbook, you should study its structure and features. Complete the following activity for a chapter that your science instructor assigns. By understanding the structure of the text, you will understand the structure of the discipline and be better able to integrate new ideas into your existing mental outline. Organization of the Book Special features: What are the unique or special features of this book? Most authors write a preface to explain their purpose in writing and describe the special features of their work. Themes: What are the major themes of your text- book? Most authors group chapters in units with names that refl ect the major themes of the book. Topics: What are the main topics of the unit you are studying? This can generally be deduced from the chapter titles. Organization of the Chapter Objectives: What are the goals or objectives of the chapter you are studying? These are frequently listed at the beginning of the chapter. Subtopics: What are the subtopics of the chap- ter? The subtopics are the division headings within chapters, often shown in BOLDFACE CAPITALS . Major points: What are the major points of the section you are now studying? The major points are generally shown in lowercase bold letters . Key terms: What are the key terms of the section you are now studying? In most textbooks, the key terms are shown in italics or bold letters. 8.2 Orders of Magnitude: The Universe in Powers of Ten \" How wide is the Milky Way galaxy? \" \" How small is a carbon atom? \" These questions may sound simple, but their answers are virtually impos-sible to comprehend since nothing in our realm of experience approximates either of these meas-ures. T o grasp the magnitude of such dimensions is perhaps impossible, but it is relatively easy to express such dimensions by scaling up or down (expressing them in orders of magnitude greater or smaller) from things with whose dimensions we are familiar. An order of magnitude is the number of powers of 10 contained in the number and gives a shorthand way to describe scale. An understand-ing of scale allows us to organize our thinking and experience in terms of size and gives us a sense of dimension within the universe. ACTIVITY 8.2.1 Understanding Powers of Ten Note: This is an Internet - based activity. T o simplify the expression of very large and small numbers, scientists often use scienti c nota- tion. Scienti c notation involves writing a number as the product of two numbers. The rst one, the digit value, is always more than 1 and less than 10. The other, the exponential term, is expressed as a power of 10. Table 8.3 compares decimal and sci-enti c notation. The diameter of the Milky Way Galaxy is believed to be about 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 meters. By contrast, the diameter of the nucleus of a carbon atom is only approximately 0.000 000 000 000 01 meters. In scienti c notation, the diameter of the Milky Way is 1 /H11003 10 21 m, and the diameter of the carbon nucleus is 1 /H11003 10 /H11002 14 m. The Milky Way is therefore approximately 10 35 times (35 orders of magnitude) larger than the carbon atom. Calculators and computers may express the dimensions of the Milky Way and the carbon nucleus as 1.0E21 and 1.0E - 14, where E stands for the exponential term. The speed of light, approximately 300 million (299,792,458) m c08.indd 154 c08.indd 154 5/9/08 5:57:33 PM 5/9/08 5:57:33 PM Organizing Science Information and Concepts 155 per second, is expressed in scienti c notation as approximately 3.0 /H11003 10 8 m/s (3.0E8). Avogadro ' s number, the number of a mole (602213670000000000000000), is expressed as 6.02 /H11003 10 23 (6.02E23). Scienti c notation is particularly helpful when trying to express the scale of the universe. In 1957, Dutch educator Kees Boeke published Cosmic View: The Universe in 40 Jumps, in which he helped readers visualize the size of things in the known universe with reference to a square meter (10 0 m 2 = 1 m 2 ). 2 In this book, Boeke showed successively smaller pictures, each one a tenth the dimension of the previous (10 /H11002 1 m, 10 /H11002 2 m, 10 /H11002 3 m, and so on) as well as successively larger pictures, each ten times larger than the previous (10 1 m, 10 2 m, 10 3 m, and so on). A number of moviemakers 3 and Web developers have followed Boeke ' s idea in an effort to help people understand the scale of things in the universe. After examining \" powers of ten \" resources online (look on sciencesourcebook. com or www.powersof10.com , or search \" powers of ten \" ), perform the following investigation. Figure 8.2 displays millimeter graph paper. The tiny black square in the upper left corner is 1 mm on a side, (10 /H11002 3 meters). The sides of the gray square in the upper left corner are an order of magnitude greater than the black square (10 mm per side, 10 /H11002 2 m). Finally, the sides of the entire sheet, with 100 mm per side (10 /H11002 1 m), are two orders of magnitude greater than the black square and one order of magnitude greater than the gray square. Working with your classmates, create a square meter (1000 mm on a side) by tap-ing 100 of these squares together in a 10 /H11003 10 square. This is 1 square meter with sides and area three orders of magnitude greater than the square millimeter represented by the tiny black box. Measuring with a meter stick, place mark-ers at the four corners of a 10 m square in one corner of your school ' s football field. This is four orders of magnitude greater than the origi-nal black square (1 /H11003 10 4 times larger). If space permits, mark out a 100 m square as shown in Figure 8.3 . This square has sides that are five orders of magnitude larger (1 /H11003 10 5 ) than the original black square. Y ou may continue to increase the order of magnitude by using satellite photos of your cam-pus that are available on the Internet (look on sciencesourcebook.com , satellite view at maps. google.com , or earth.google.com ).

The following description of the organizational hier-archy starts with the smallest and most basic item and works toward the largest and most complex: Fundamental particles: We now believe that there are two basic types of fundamental, \u007f structureless particles of which all matter is made: quarks (up, down, charm, strange, top, bot- tom) (electron neutrino, electron, muon neutrino, muon, tau neutrino, tau). Future research may show that even these particles, with radii less than 10 /H11002 19 m, are themselves composed of smaller particles. Subatomic particles: Protons and neutrons are made of quarks. Electrons are a type of lepton, and hence also considered to be fundamental particles. Acids are substances that can donate protons, and bases are electron pair donors. All living systems \u007f c08.indd 157 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science contain water, the pH of which is controlled by the presence of acids or bases. Atoms are composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Currently there are 116 known ele-ments. The following is a list of the most impor-tant elements for living systems, easily remembered by the acronym C HOPKINS CaFe Mg NaCl : \" C. HOPKINS CaFe is M ighty g ood, but needs salt ( NaCl ). \" Note that the underlined from which macromolecules are made, and are them-selves made of atoms. Glucose, ribose, glycerol, and fatty acids are made of C, H, and O, and amino acids and nucleotides are made of C, H, O, N, P , and S. Macromolecules are large molecules consisting of many subunits. For example, starch is composed of many glucose units, proteins are composed of many amino acids, lipids are composed of glycerol and fatty acids, and nucleic acids are composed pri- marily of nucleotides and ribose. Molecular assemblies are large, organized sets of molecular units. For example, microtubules (involved in cilia, fl agella and the cytoskeleton) are polymers of the protein (tubulin), and membranes (providing structure and boundaries to organelles and cells) are composed of lipids and proteins. Organelles are \" little organs, \" or special- ized structures of the cell. They are composed of molecular assemblies and molecules of all sizes. Mitochondria (ATP - generating stations) are organelles composed of numerous mem-branes, while centrioles (organelles organizing the spindle bers in cell division) are composed of microtubules. Cells are the simplest unit of biological organization. They are bounded by plasma mem-branes and composed of numerous organelles. For example, a neuron is a membrane bound structure, powered by mitochondria. Tissues are groups of similar cells that carry out speci c sets of functions. For exam- ple, nervous tissue is composed of neurons and is \u007f \u007f\u007f\u007f \u007f \u007f specialized for the conduction and transmission of nerve impulses. In animals, there are four basic tissue types: nervous, muscular, epithelial, and connective. Organs are composed of tissues that are organized to perform speci c functions. For example, the brain is composed of different nerv- ous, connective, and epithelial tissues and func-tions to govern the body. Organ systems are groups of organs that conduct a wide set of functions. For example, the nervous system is composed of the brain, spi- nal cord, and cranial and spinal nerves. It receives information from external and internal environ-ments, processes data, and responds appropriately to the stimuli. Organisms are individuals with their own dis- tinct, unique existence. They range in complexity from single - celled organisms such as paramecium or amoeba, to complex multisystem organisms like humans. Humans, tigers, squirrels, and other mammals are composed of 11 major systems: nervous, integumentary, circulatory, endocrine, lymphatic, digestive, urinary, skeletal, muscular, respiratory, and reproductive. Organisms belong to a species, which is de ned as a type of organism that can interbreed, and shares common traits. Populations are groups of individuals of the same species that are capable of interacting and interbreeding. Due to transportation and commu-nication, the boundaries of human populations are fl exible, but one can still talk loosely about the \" population of the United States \" or the \" Tucano (tribal) population of the Amazonian Basin. \" Populations are often composed of smaller groups. For example, the ant population on an island may be composed of many colonies, and the wolf pop- ulation in Y ellowstone is composed of different packs. Other collective names for animal groups are herd (elephants, sheep, buffalo), pod (whales, seals), school ( sh), troop (kangaroos, monkeys), fl ock (birds), and pride (lions). Community: A community is composed of populations of different species that live in the same region and interact with one another. For example, one can talk about the riparian (stream- side) community along the Salt River in Arizona. 5:57:37 PM Organizing Science Information and Concepts 159 This encompasses all of the plant and animal species living along this river. Ecosystem: An ecosystem is an integrated association of biological and physical resources existing in the same region. Ecosystems result from the interaction of biological, geochemical, and geophysical systems. Ponds, forests, and estu- aries are examples of ecosystems. The boundaries between ecosystems are ill de ned. Biome: Biomes are the world ' s major life zones, classi ed according to the predominant vegetation and climate. They are composed of many similar and related ecosystems. For example, tropical rain forests are dominated by trees and are characterized by plants and animals that live in its warm, humid climate. Biosphere: The biosphere is the region in which life exists on Earth, reaching from the deep- est oceanic trenches where thermophilic bacteria are the dominant life - forms, to regions high in the atmosphere where microbes and spores are carried aloft by strong winds. ACTIVITY 8.3.1 Visualizing the Levels of Organization Create a poster showing the levels of biological organization. Using a graphic search engine (such \u007f \u007f\u007fas the ones at sciencesource book.com or images. google.com nd one or more images of a repre- sentative of each level to include on the chart. For example, you can show pictures of mitochondria, chloroplasts, or nuclei to illustrate the organelle level and pictures of tundra and tropical rain for-est to illustrate the biome level. Alternatively, you may choose to draw representative items for each level. Be creative! ACTIVITY 8.3.2 Identifying the Levels of Organization When addressing a letter, the sender identi es the recipient ' s rst name, last name, street number, street name, city, state, zip code, and country. This information uniquely speci es the recipient out of more than 6 billion people in the world. Table 8.6 illustrates a similar method of identifying the posi-tion of an item such as a textbook, which could be located anywhere in the world. For example, you could identify a speci c book by saying it is the biology book on the third desk, in the fth row, of the second room, on the east hall of the north wing, of the third fl oor, of the science building, on the CSUN campus, in the community of Northridge, in the city of Los Angeles, in the county of Los Angeles, of the state of California, in the country of the Table 8.6 Levels of Organization in Biology Level of Organization Example Set 1 Example Set 2 Analogy Fundamental particles Book Biology book Subatomic particles Desk Third desk Atoms Row Fifth row Micromolecules Room Second room Macromolecules Hall East hall Molecular assemblies Wing North wing Organelles Floor Third fl oor Cells Building Science building Tissues Campus CSUN Organs Community Northridge Organ systems City Los Angeles Organisms County Los Angeles County Populations State California Communities Country United States Ecosystems Continent North America Biomes Hemisphere Western Hemisphere Biosphere Planet Earth c08.indd 159 5/9/08 5:57:38 PM 5/9/08 5:57:38 PM160 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Table 8.7 The Domains of Various Biological Disciplines Molecule on the continent of North America, located in the Western Hemisphere, of the planet Earth. The sequence of levels listed ( book, desk, row, room, hall, wing, fl oor, building, campus, community, city, county, state, country, continent, hemisphere, planet ) represents an organizational hierarchy analo- gous to the biological hierarchy as shown in Table 8.6 : fundamental particles, subatomic particles, atoms, micromolecules, macromolecules, molecular assem-blies, organelles, cells, tiss ues, organs, organ systems, organisms, populations, communities, ecosystems, biomes, and biosphere. For the terms that follow, identify the appropriate level of organization by placing the term in the correct cell of Table 8.6 . Set 1: alpine, brain, carbon, Earth, fatty acid, gray matter, lipid, marmot, meadow, nervous system, neuron, nuclear membrane, nucleus, protons, quark, tundra, Tuolumne pack Set 2: chloroplast, deciduous forest, Earth, glycine, leaf, maple tree, neutrons, nitrogen, Ohio hardwood forests, palisade, parenchyma, plasmalemma, protein, quark, riparian, stand, vegetative system ACTIVITY 8.3.3 Organizing the Many Disciplines of Biology Biology is a vast eld of study that includes many disciplines, each with a unique focus at one or more levels of organization. For example, an orni-thologist studies birds (organism level), and a cytologist studies cells (cellular level). Some elds of study cover many areas. For example, anatomy studies the structure and parts of the body. One can talk about the anatomy of an organelle, cell, tissue, organ, system, or organism, as represented by the cells in Table 8.7 with an X in them. By contrast, biochemistry deals speci cally with the 5/9/08 5:57:39 PM 5/9/08 5:57:39 PM Organizing Science Information and Concepts 161 level, while biology studies all levels from molecular through biome. Complete Table 8.7 by noting with an X the main levels of organization each discipline studies. Y our teacher may assign a discipline to individuals, and request them to report to the class after completing their research. Note that some boundaries are less distinct than others. 8.4 Organization of the Chemistry Curriculum Chemistry is the study of the composition, struc- ture, properties, and reactions of matter. There are a variety of ways to organize the study of chem-istry, and three are presented here: (1) the pat-tern followed by many introductory chemistry classes, (2) the outline used by the College Board ' s Advanced Placement Chemistry program, and (3) the way most colleges departmentalize chemistry. ACTIVITY 8.4.1 Developing an Outline for Chemistry Develop an outline for your chemistry textbook, and compare it with the three outlines listed here. Which of the models does your chemistry book most closely resemble? Give a one - sentence de nition for each item in your outline as illustrated in model 3. Y our outline will serve as a road map as you study chemistry. Refer to it often to develop an under-standing of the scope and organization of chemistry. Model 1: Introductory Chemistry 1.

Although physics is a large and diverse eld of study, most textbook authors and physics teachers organize it in a man-ner similar to that shown in Table 8.8 . The outline of your book or class will be your road map for physics. Study the outline that follows (or the one used by your teacher or textbook), and review it throughout the course. ACTIVITY 8.5.1 Using the \"Road Map\" for Physics Use your reasoning skills to match each of the fol-lowing activities with the subtopics listed in the physics outline in Table 8.8 , making logical guesses if necessary.

Although environmental and earth science cover essentially the same mate-rial, environmental science places greater emphasis on the biological realm, while earth science places greater emphasis on the physical realm. Environmental and earth science study the interactions of four major systems or spheres (Figure 8.6 ): The geosphere consists of the core, mantle, and crust of the Earth. The atmosphere contains all of the Earth ' s air and is divided into troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and ionosphere. T h e hydrosphere contains all of the solid, liq- uid, and gaseous water on Earth, extending from the depths of the sea to the upper reaches of the troposphere where water is found. Ninety - seven percent of the hydrosphere is found in salty oceans, and the remainder is found as vapor or droplets in the atmos-phere and as liquid in groundwater, lakes, riv-ers, glaciers, and snow elds. The biosphere is the collection of all Earth ' s life forms, distributed in major life zones known as biomes: tundra, boreal forest, temperate deciduous \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007f Although the four systems have their unique identities, there is substantial interaction among them. Environmental scientists study the effects of events in one sphere on the other spheres. For example, a volcanic eruption in the geosphere may cause profound direct and indirect effects on the hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. The fol-lowing examples of a volcano and re illustrate these relationships. Example 1: Volcano On May 18, 1980, Mount Saint Helens, in the state of Washington, erupted. This event altered the surrounding environment and provided sci-entists with an opportunity to study the effects of volcanic eruptions on the geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. Such studies are vital because volcanic eruptions will continue to occur and will have increasing impact on humans as people continue to settle closer to dormant volca-noes. The following are but a few of the myriad of interactions resulting from a volcanic eruption. Volcano geosphere atmosphere hydrosphere biosphere Volcanoes (an event in the geosphere) release a large amount of particulate matter into the atmosphere. These particles serve as nuclei for the formation of water droplets (hydrosphere). Rainfall (hydrosphere) often increases following an eruption, stimulating plant growth (biosphere). Particulate matter in the air (atmosphere) falls out, initially smothering plants (biosphere) but ulti-mately enriching the soil (geosphere) and thereby stimulating plant growth (biosphere). Volcano geosphere hydrosphere biosphere Volcanoes (events in the geosphere) may release a substantial amount of hot lava (geo-sphere), which causes mountain glaciers (hydro-sphere) to melt. Mud fl ows (geosphere) and fl ooding occur downstream from noes and may coremantlecrustGEOSPHEREATMOSPHEREbiomes Figure 8.6 Interaction of the Four Spheres of Earth Science c08.indd 163 c08.indd 163 5/9/08 5:57:40 Teaching Science Volcanoes (events of the geosphere) release a large amount of carbon dioxide (atmosphere), the raw material for sugar production in plants (biosphere). This may increase photosynthetic production and eventually increase the amount of biomass, which, after a very long time, forms coal and oil deposits (geosphere). Volcano complex interactions Volcanoes (geosphere) may emit large quantities of sulfur dioxide (atmosphere). When atmospheric sulfur dioxide combines with water (hydrosphere), sulfuric and sulfurous acid form. Rain (hydrosphere) may bring these acids to the Earth, acidifying soils (geosphere), lakes, and riv-ers (hydrosphere). Acidic water leaches nutrients from the soil (geosphere) into the water table (hydrosphere), making the soil less fertile for plants (biosphere) and the subterranean water supply (hydrosphere) less potable for humans (biosphere). Acid rain falling on lakes and streams reduces the pH of the water (hydrosphere), which may result in a decrease in phytoplankton and zooplankton growth (biosphere). If photosyn-thesis is reduced, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide can build up and stimulate global warming (atmosphere), which may contribute to increased melting of glaciers (hydrosphere). Example 2: Fire Forest res are a common occurrence in the west- ern United States. A prolonged drought at the turn of the twentieth century sparked many forest res and many heated debates on how to reduce the risk to human and natural resources. Following are a few of the many system interactions resulting from large forest r e s : Fire biosphere hydrosphere geosphere biosphere Forest res (event) remove much of the bio- mass and expose the soil (geosphere) to rainfall (hydrosphere). The resulting sheet, rill, and gully erosion may remove topsoil (geosphere) from the affected area. The lack of suf cient topsoil reduces the carrying capacity (biosphere) of the region. As \u007f \u007f \u007fsilt erodes into streams (hydrosphere), turbidity increases, decreasing the amount of sunlight avail-able to plankton (biosphere) and other species that live in the stream. Reduced productivity by these plants results in a decrease in the animal spe-cies (biosphere) that depend on them. Fire biosphere geosphere biosphere Plant biomass contains many minerals that are released into the soil (geosphere) following a re (event). In addition, re removes the canopy of vegetation (biosphere), allowing more light to pene-trate to the soil (geosphere). Plants (biosphere) that require bare, mineral - enriched soil thrive in this new environment, initiating the rst step in succession. Fire biosphere atmosphere biosphere Fire (event) transforms wood (biosphere) into carbon dioxide and water vapor (atmosphere). Increased levels of carbon dioxide may contrib-ute to global warming (atmosphere) and promote plant growth (biosphere) because photosynthesis is dependent upon atmospheric carbon dioxide. ACTIVITY 8.6.1 Earth Science Systems Interactions Describe the direct and indirect infl uence of the following events on all four spheres: geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. For each, draw one sequence of interactions as illustrated in examples 1 and 2 above: Comet strike: On June 30, 1908, a comet frag- ment approximately 80 m in diameter entered the Earth ' s atmosphere and exploded in the air above the Tunguska Valley in Siberia, Russia. Research the Tunguska event, and describe the Earth systems interactions. Use of CFCs: Chlorofl uorocarbons were ammable refrig- erants. Research the effect of CFCs on ozone, and describe potential Earth systems interactions. Burning of fossil fuels: Fossil fuels (oil, coal, natural gas) provide much of the energy for modern civilization. Describe Earth systems interactions that may have resulted from the increased use of fossil fuels. \u007f PM Organizing Science Information and Concepts 165 Deforestation policies in tropical rainforests: An increasing demand for agricultural and range land has prompted dramatic deforestation in tropical rain forests. Describe the Earth sys-tems interactions that may result from massive deforestation of the tropical rain forests. Hunting predators: In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt established Grand Canyon National Game Preserve to preserve the mule deer from overhunting. Although it was illegal to kill mule deer, hunters could still kill mountain lions, bobcats, and wolves. Research the Earth systems interactions of a policy that allows hunting predators but not their prey. The Earth systems interactions approach to teaching environmental and Earth science requires students to tie together knowledge in an \u007f \u007f integrated, nonlinear fashion. Y ou may wish to create some of your own questions using things that involve more than one sphere, such as illus-trated in Table 8.9 . Earth systems interactions is a problem - based approach to learning and is best done with teams. Y ou may wish to create elec-tronic news groups (see sciencesourcebook.com ) to promote this interaction outside class time. Answers to Chapter Activities 8.1.1 See Table 8.10 . 8.1.2 Students will develop an advance organizer for their text as outlined in the assignment description. 8.2.1 T o understand lengths, it is important to have a com- mon referent, something students can refer to when estimating length. For example, doorknobs are generally 1 meter from the ground. When asked to visualize 0.05 m or 3 m, students can do so by reference to the height of a doorknob. Student responses will vary considerably depending upon the student ' s experience.

Y ou may want to tell your students that many measurement units were originally derived from natural measurements. The inch represented the width of an average thumb; the foot, the length of a human foot; the yard, the distance from the tip of the nose to the end of the middle nger of an outstretched arm; the fathom, the distance from one ngertip to the other; and the cubit, the length of the forearm. 8.2.2 The \" powers of ten \" posters can become a permanent display in your classroom. Students can compare the size of things they are currently studying with refer-ences on the wall. Many students are intrigued with computers and are familiar with computer jargon. Y ou may therefore wish to point out the orders of magni-tude used to quantify computer memory: byte (1; 1 character kilobyte (1000; 1 /H11003 10 3 ) \u2014 half a printed page megabyte (1,000,000; 1 /H11003 10 6 ) \u2014 small book g i g a b y t e (1,000,000,000; 1 /H11003 10 9 ) \u2014 1,000 books terabyte (1,000,000,000,000; 1 /H11003 10 12 ) \u2014 a college re search library 8.3.1 Student posters can make good room decorations. Y ou may wish to provide students with additional ideas at each level so that their posters look different from one another. For example, you may tell them that they can illustrate the biome level with any of the following biomes: desert, tundra, taiga, temperate deciduous forest, mixed conifer-ous forest, chaparral, savanna, rain forest. 8.3.2 See Table 8.12 . 8.3.3 Table 8.13 shows the main levels that each of these biological disciplines is concerned with. Note that there are other legitimate answers depending on the de nitions one adopts. The purpose of this question is not to achieve an absolute answer but to show that the disciplines of biology focus on different levels or com-binations of levels. 8.4.1 The three models illustrate a variety of ways a curricu- lum can be logically arranged. Note that the curricular structure of your textbook or course might be dif-ferent from any of these models. Post the curricular outline you are using on your classroom wall and on your class Web site so students can refer to it as they progress through the course. The curriculum outline provides students a schema into which new informa-tion can be organized. Many states, provinces, and countries have adopted content standards. If this is true where you teach, use these content standards as an outline. 8.5.1 The answers that follow use titles from the physics out- line in this chapter. The chapter titles from your text-book might be slightly different. I suggest that you use this activity near the beginning, middle, and end of your course to encourage students to develop and use a schema for understanding physics. a.

T eachers should have an awareness of their own mental processes and be able to monitor, regulate, and direct them so they can help students do the same and thereby maximize learning. For example, teachers and learners should be able to identify and differentiate rote learning from mean-ingful learning. In rote learning, students memorize information without necessarily understanding or applying concepts. It is a mechanical form of learn-ing, reliant on memorization and practice drills. By contrast, meaningful learning takes place when learn- ers relate new knowledge to existing concepts. Rote learning may be useful in reciting information, but it is of little value in problem solving. By contrast, meaningful learning may not produce excellent reci-tation, but it will be of much greater value in assist-ing problem solving, analysis, and evaluation. Educators infl uence the type of learning that occurs through instruction and assessment. If teachers introduce new concepts without relat-ing them to familiar ones and if they deliver tests that require verbatim recall of information, stu-dents will most likely engage in rote learning. If, however, teachers introduce new concepts in rela-tion to existing ones and deliver assessments that require understanding, students will be more likely to engage in meaningful learning. Graphic organizers are a means of introduc- ing and assessing concepts in a manner that encourages meaningful learning. Graphic organ-izers are diagrams or maps that show the relation-ship between new and existing concepts, thereby facilitating integration of new and familiar ideas. Conceptual grids, Venn diagrams, fl owcharts, mind maps, and concept maps are some of the more common graphic organizers used to introduce science concepts and assess student learning, and they form the basis of this chapter. c09.indd 168 c09.indd 168 5/9/08 2:33:26 PM 5/9/08 2:33:26 PMGraphic Organizers for Science 169 9.1 Conceptual Grids Many real - world decisions depend on a number of variables. For example, the decision to attend a particular college may be dependent on cost, quality of education, impact on future career, availability of student housing, and proximity to family and friends. Making complex decisions can be simpli ed by creating a conceptual grid such as shown in Table 9.1 . By lling in the key variables, the user can make quick comparisons. Conceptual grids are helpful when comparing and contrasting scienti c concepts. For example, Table 9.2 compares Earth with its nearest neigh-bors, Venus and Mars, with respect to some impor-tant physical characteristics. This table normalizes all values with respect to Earth. In other words, the value for Earth is de ned as 1 for each quantity, and the values for Venus and Mars are compared to it. For example, Venus has 81.5 percent the mass (0.815) of Earth, while Mars has only 10.7 percent (0.107). The conceptual grid allows us to make a simple comparison of values as shown in Table 9.2 and graphed in Figure 9.1 . Conceptual grids provide structure by organ- izing data as records (a row of information related to the same entity) and elds (a column of fea- tures that are compared). Table 9.3 is a concep-tual grid comparing three classes of sh, Agnatha, Chondrichthyes, and Osteichthyes, according to temperature regulation, ns, respiration, skel- eton, swim bladder, and mouth. When this grid is constructed, it becomes clear that 21 cells must be lled in to complete the comparison. Blank cells are an instant visual reminder that more data must be supplied. When the grid is Problem solving is dependent on the quantity and quality of concepts stored in one ' s long - term memory. Before new concepts can be stored in long - term memory (see Chapter Eleven ), it is necessary to rst encode them in short - term, or working, memory. Since working memory can process only ve to nine items at any moment, it is necessary to organize larger bodies of informa-tion in logical ways that can be easily encoded as new information is received. Graphic organizers, particularly concept maps and outlines, facili-tate meaningful learning by serving as a template by which knowledge is structured and encoded. It appears that the mind organizes knowledge in hierarchical frameworks, and learning techniques that present material in organized, integrated frameworks facilitate long - term memory. Graphic organizers are valuable for instruc- tion, study, and assessment. When teachers intro-duce material using graphic organizers, they present information in a logical manner to facili-tate encoding into short - and long - term memory. In addition, they present a model of meaning-ful learning in which new concepts are integrated with familiar ones. Students can learn from such modeling and review and study subject matter by developing their own graphic organizers that show the relationship between relevant concepts using categories, position, and propositions (connec-tions between two or more concepts). T eachers can then assess student understanding by evaluating student - generated graphic organizers. Although much more dif cult to assess than objective rote - based questions, graphic organizers provide a valuable window to view student understanding and misconceptions.

For example, note that all three classes of sh have ns, gills, and are ecto- therms. Both Chondrichthyes and Agnatha have skeletons bladders, while both Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes have jaws. A quick scan of the table reveals similarities and differences that might otherwise be overlooked. Conceptual grids are essentially simple data- bases, comparing records (items compared) across elds (topics of comparison). The problems pre- sented in this section illustrate a wide range of applications in science and should be assigned as research projects for individuals or teams. Once students have completed a table, they can be asked to summarize their ndings. For example, c09.indd 170 c09.indd 170 5/9/08 2:33:28 PM 5/9/08 2:33:28 PMGraphic Organizers for Science 171 after completing a conceptual grid comparing the four known forces with respect to strength, range, and particles involved (Table 9.4 ), students may note that gravity is approximately 39 orders of magnitude weaker than the strong nuclear force, yet its range is believed to be in nite, while the range of strong nuclear force is only one - millionth of one - billionth of a meter! The astounding dif-ferences between these forces that might be quite easily lost in a paragraph become evident in a con-ceptual grid. T eachers are encouraged to develop their own conceptual grids, consistent with their speci c needs, with the hope that students will eventually employ such techniques without prompting. Student answers will vary. ACTIVITY 9.1.1 Developing Conceptual Grids for Biology Virtually any type of comparison can be placed in a conceptual grid. Collect data from your text-book, the Internet, or the library, and develop a conceptual grid for one of the following, or for a topic speci ed by your instructor. Arthropods: Arthropods make up over 75 per- cent of the world ' s animal species. Arthropods include animals such as insects, crustaceans, and arachnids. Compare and contrast these three classes with respect to skeleton, legs, body systems, body parts, antennae, eyes, append-ages, and examples. \u007f Monocots and dicots: owering plants as monocots or dicots. Develop a conceptual grid to compare mono-cots and dicots with respect to the number of cotyledons, pollen structure, of fl ower parts, leaf venation, stem vascular arrange-ment, roots, secondary growth, and examples. Biomolecules: Develop a conceptual grid that compares and contrasts the four types of bio-logical macromolecules \u2014 carbohydrates, pro-teins, lipids, and nucleic acids \u2014 with respect to elemental composition, structure, and function. mRNA, tRNA, rRNA: Develop a conceptual grid that compares and contrasts the three most common forms of RNA with respect to chemical composition, structure, location, and function. ACTIVITY 9.1.2 Developing Conceptual Grids for Chemistry Collect data from your textbook, the Internet, or the library, and develop a conceptual grid for one of the following, or for a topic speci ed by your instructor. Family similarities: Develop a conceptual grid that compares members of a family (e.g., alkali metals, halogens, noble gases) according to such key features as mass, electronegativity, melting point, and rst ionization potential. Differences between families: Using a concep- tual grid, and contrast the general \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007fTable 9.4 Conceptual Grid for Four Forces Strength Range Particle Strong nuclear 1 10/H1100215 m gluon Electro magnetic 7 /H11003 10/H110023in nite inverse square law appliesphoton Weak nuclear 1 /H11003 10/H11002610/H1100218 m 0.1% diameter of a protonintermediate vector bosons 6 /H11003 10/H1100239in nite The Sourcebook for Teaching Science characteristics of any two families of elements according to criteria of your choice. Metals, nonmetals, metalloids: The elements of the periodic table can be classi ed as metals, nonmetals, and metalloids. Develop a concep-tual grid that distinguishes these three groups of elements with respect to luster, malleability, electrical conductivity, heat conductivity, pH of oxides, and the nature of ions in solution. Nuclear fusion and ssion: People often confuse nuclear fusion and ssion. Develop a concep- tual grid that shows the similarities and dif-ferences between these two nuclear processes with respect to reactants, products, conditions, controllability, and amount of energy released. ACTIVITY 9.1.3 Developing Conceptual Grids for Earth and Space Science Collect data from your textbook, the Internet, or the library, and develop a conceptual grid for one of the following, or for a topic speci ed by your instructor. Inner versus outer planets: Astronomers have noted substantial differences between the four inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and the four large outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). Develop a con-ceptual grid to compare and contrast these two sets of planets with respect to size, composition, rings, orbital speed, density, and temperature. Hurricanes and tornadoes: Hurricanes and tornadoes are potentially destructive storms. Using a conceptual grid, compare and contrast these storms with respect to wind direction, wind speed, life span, storm width, prediction time, and location. Types of rocks: Geologists classify rocks as igne- ous, sedimentary, or metamorphic. Develop a conceptual grid that compares these rocks with respect to origin, crystal size, abundance, and location within the Earth. Short - versus long - term comets: Compare and contrast short - and long - term comets with respect to orbit, aphelion, nucleus, coma, and composition. \u007f ACTIVITY 9.1.4 Developing Conceptual Grids for Physics Collect data from your textbook, the Internet, or the library, and develop a conceptual grid for one of the following, or for a topic speci ed by your instructor. Heat transfer: Heat is transferred from one location to another by convection, conduc-tion, and radiation. Develop a conceptual grid that compares and contrasts these forms of heat transfer with respect to the mechanism of transfer and the direction of transfer. Forces: Our current understanding is that there are four fundamental forces in the universe: gravity, nuclear weak force, electromagnetic force, and nuclear strong force. Develop a con-ceptual grid to compare the nature of these forces, their relative strength, the range over which they act, and the particles involved. DC and AC circuits: Electrical appliances run on direct current (DC) or alternating cur-rent (AC) circuits. Develop a conceptual grid to compare and contrast AC and DC circuits with respect to method of generation, polarity, equipment powered, and power transmission. Waves: A wave is a disturbance that trav- els through a medium, transporting energy without transporting matter. Waves can be longitudinal, transverse, or super cial. Use a conceptual grid to compare and contrast these waves with respect to particle movement, and give examples of each. 9.2 Venn Diagrams One of the best - known ways of comparing and contrasting information is the Venn diagram, developed by mathematicians to show the relation-ship between sets of numbers. Circles are drawn to represent sets, and the areas in which these cir-cles intersect illustrate the items held in common by both sets. Venn diagrams are useful in science, providing a quick summary of the similarities and differences between items compared. Figure 9.2 A shows a Venn diagram for biology and chemistry. The intersection between biology and chemistry is \u007f \u007f Organizers for Science 173 the domain of biochemistry, a topic that is generally addressed in both biology and chemistry texts but is also a de ned eld of study. Figure 9.2 B illustrates a more complex situation, looking at the intersection of physiology, botany, and ecology. The intersection between botany and physiology is plant physiol-ogy, the intersection between botany and ecology is plant ecology, and the intersection between physi-ology and ecology is physiological ecology. The science at the intersection of all three is known as physiological plant ecology. Figure 9.2 C illustrates a situation in which one eld of study is a subset of another. Herpetology (the study of reptiles) is a eld within zoology, and zoology is a eld within biology. Figure 9.3 is a Venn diagram to show the simi- larities and differences of three classes of animals. A glance shows that all three classes are animals that have backbones, lungs, and claws or nails. It shows that only birds and mammals are endo-therms with three - chambered hearts, while birds and reptiles share a similar jaw structure unlike that of mammals. The diagram also shows that each class has its own unique characteristics as well. Using the Internet or traditional print resources, research a set of topics selected by your teacher or one of the sets listed in the activities.

Flowcharts are frequently used in computer science and business, and a standard set of symbols has been developed to represent speci c stages (Figure 9.4 ). Traditionally the beginning of a process is indi-cated with a rounded rectangle, and an action is marked with a squared rectangle. Decisions are indicated with diamonds, documents with rectan-gles with a wavy side, and outputs marked with a rhombus. These symbols are helpful but method is a process that is generally presented as a list, such as the one that follows: 1. Make observations and identify the problem. 2. Form a hypothesis. 3. T est the hypothesis by performing experi ments. 4. Organize and analyze data. 5. Draw conclusions. 6. Communicate results. Although this list is helpful, it does not refl ect the variety of problem - solving routes scientists use, which may be more accurately represented with a fl owchart (Figure 9.5 ). The fl owchart illus- trates features that are dif cult to describe in a list. Beginning or end of the processAction or process performedDecision Document Output Figure 9.4 Flowchart Symbols yes+verify results noyes no-no yes submit for publicationDefine/Identify the Problem Read the LiteratureMake observations Test hypothesis/ Perform experimentDevelop hypothesis Organize & analyze data Do observations & results support hypothesis?share resultsconfirm hypothesis Was the experiment flawed?Design an experiment reject hypothesisDo you have ideas for improvement? Figure 9.5 Flowchart for \"Scienti c 2:33:32 PMGraphic Organizers for Science 175 For example, if the results of an experiment are not consistent with the hypothesis, the researcher can ask if the experiment was fl awed. If it is con- cluded that the experiment is not fl awed, then the hypothesis may be rejected, but if it is fl awed, the researcher searches for ways to improve the experiment by consulting the literature or propos-ing an alternative design, or both. Although this is dif cult to explain with words, it is succinctly communicated on the fl owchart as shown in Figure 9.5 . ACTIVITY 9.3.1 Developing Your Own Taxonomic Flowchart Taxonomy is the science of classi cation. Geologists classify rocks, astronomers classify stars, botanists classify plants, zoologists classify animals, musicians classify music, artists clas-sify art, and even hardware manufacturers clas-sify hardware. Figure 9.6 is a fl owchart that leads to the classi cation of screws commonly used in construction. The diamonds represent decisions that must be made in order to identify a screw. sheet metal screwPhillips oval headed sheet metal screw Phillips flat head wood screwIs the top of the shaft threaded?Is the tip of the shaft threaded?Is the head rounded on top?

Figure 9.6 Taxonomic Flowchart for Wood and Metal Screws c09.indd 175 5/9/08 2:33:33 PM 5/9/08 2:33:33 PM176 Sourcebook for Teaching Science After studying Figure 9.6 , develop your own taxonomic fl owchart for items of your choos- ing. Y ou may classify fl owers, rocks, fabrics, leaves, wood, assorted junk, or a collection of hard-ware (nails, screws, washers, bolts, hinges, clasps). Alternatively, you may classify photographs (cut from magazines or printed from the Internet) of cars, jewelry, foods, or other subjects of your choos-ing. Y ou may develop a taxonomic chart on poster board or electronically using software (available at sciencesourcebook.com ). Each decision should be a dichotomy (only two choices) as shown in the tax-onomy of the wood and metal screws (Figure 9.6 ). 9.4 Mind Maps Mind mapping is a brainstorming technique in which a radial \" map \" is developed showing the relationship of a central idea to supporting facts and concepts. The idea to be investigated is placed in the center, surrounded by series of sup-porting ideas (branches), which are themselves surrounded, by supporting information (twigs). Figure 9.7 is a mind map for \" energy. \" Note that four major ideas (units, uses, laws, forms) are con-nected to \" energy, \" and numerous secondary ideas are connected to these. This mind map provides a picture of what we know about energy and allows us to add new information and ideas by adding additional branches and twigs. Memory experts urge users to embellish their mind maps by group-ing with colors or adding drawings. Although football is wildly popular in the United States, it is relatively unknown in many other nations around the world. In fact, when \" football \" is mentioned, most internationals think of the sport Americans call soccer.

For example, one could explain that football is played on a eld similar to a soccer eld, with a ball shaped somewhat like a rugby ball, by players wearing helmets similar to those worn by motor-cyclists, and shoes with spikes similar to those worn by sprinters. Such comparisons can help someone visualize the game but only if he or she is already familiar with the other sports mentioned. If the other person knows nothing of rugby, soc-cer, motorcycling, or running, such descriptions would be useless, but for avid sports fans, such comparisons would be very helpful in under-standing football. This illustrates the point that the more one knows, the easier it is to acquire new information, providing the learner actively estab-lishes links between the old and new information. Unfortunately, many students have not learned to make meaningful links between new and existing information, and therefore they are unable to bene t from information they previously learned when studying new material. Students may unwittingly compartmentalize knowledge, thereby redu cing their ability to make meaningful connections to new concepts. This is due in part to the compartmentalized instruction they may have received. Unlike science education in many other countries, American science education has histori-cally been segmented into discrete topics, such as chemistry, physics, biology, and geology. Students therefore may get the false impression that physics has nothing to do with biology and not search for useful connections between these two domains. Such linear thinking limits creativity and insight. Most educational strategies train students to think in a linear fashion through a series of singu-lar associations. However, cognitive psychologists argue that the brain operates in a radiant fashion, not a linear one, thinking from one image center out to others. Mind mapping is a technique that tries to imitate radiant thinking with the hope of engaging both sides of the brain: tapping the right side of the brain for images, dimension, size, and color and the left side for words, numbers, anal-ysis, and logic. 1 Mind mapping is a technique that may assist learners in the acquisition of new information into an existing cognitive structure and assist in the growth of the knowledge infra-structure so more information can be acquired. As students learn new information in an integrated manner, their mental schemas develop, making it ever easier for them to acquire yet more informa-tion. Student mind maps will vary depending on the connections they have made. ACTIVITY 9.4.1 Embellishing Mind Maps If you were to look through the journals or notes of Leonardo da Vinci, Albert Einstein, or Ludwig von Beethoven, you would see mind maps with colors, symbols, arrows, and pictures to augment the written notes. Memory experts encourage the use of these embellishments to promote better under-standing and memory. Embellish the mind map for energy or the circulatory system (Figures 9.7 and 9.8 ) by adding color, symbols, diagrams, or pictures. When possible, use meaningful colors, and always make drawings or diagrams that relate to the topics listed. Y ou may wish to transfer these mind maps, or portions of them, to large posters so you have suf cient room for embellishments. ACTIVITY 9.4.2 Organizing Information in a Mind Map Table 9.5 contains terms and ideas associated with water. Organize this information into a logical mind map with at least three tiers, using as many terms as you can. Y ou may wish to use some of the following terms for main branches: chemical char-acteristics, common properties, bio logical uses, composition, locations in nature, and human uses. Feel free to add additional branches and twigs. ACTIVITY 9.4.3 Developing Your Own Mind Maps Develop a mind map for a topic of your choice or one assigned by your instructor. The idea to be investigated should be placed in the center of a blank page, connected to four or ve major related topics. Each of these topics should then be con-nected to additional subtopics.

Figure 9.9 is a concept map of the cell cycle.

The growth and development phase is subdivided into three parts, and the division phase is subdivided into four. The map shows the sequence of phases and what each accomplishes. Although the same information could be described just with words, a concept map, which employs pictures, group-ings, connections, and brief descriptions, may be a more economical and effective way to accomplish the same goals. It is easier to visualize a concept map, with an organized array of entries represent-ing stages, than it is to visualize the same concept using only text. Figure 9.10 is a more complex concept map, showing the relationship of various forms of energy. The rectangles identify different forms of energy, and the arrows identify the processes by which energy is transformed from one form to another. The ovals represent uses of this energy once it is distributed to homes by electricity. Note the many ways that energy may fl ow from the Sun to power homes, industry, and appliances. Both of these concept maps summarize complex processes and represent them in the form of a map. Concept maps have been shown to aid learning and memory, but learners realize the real value of concept mapping when they develop their own maps. Concept maps can provide a founda-tion for writing reports, developing laboratory procedures, or brainstorming relationships within our complex world. Note that concept maps are not linear; they are branched and intertwined because the real world is interconnected. Spatial memory is the portion of memory responsible for recording information about one ' s environment and its spatial orientation. We use spatial memory to navigate familiar territory and visualize the world around us. Spatial memory can be used to help visualize concepts and reduce cognitive load while enhancing learning. Concept mapping is a technique that capitalizes on spatial memory to store and analyze information that is not necessarily spatial in nature. 2 Concept map- ping in science was popularized by Joseph Novak, based on the theories of David Ausubel, who stressed the importance of prior knowledge in the acquisition of new concepts. 3 Novak argued that meaningful learning involves the assimilation of new concepts and propositions into existing cog-nitive structures and suggested that this could best be done through mapping strategies that capitalize on spatial memory and intelligence. Concept maps help us visualize relationships between concepts through labeled arrows (Figures 9.9 and 9.10 ). Concept maps are frequently used to stimulate and organize idea generation and are a popular brainstorming activity used to promote creativity. The concept maps shown in Figures 9.9 and 9.10 are well thought out and can be help-ful in understanding related concepts.

Figure 9.10 Concept Map for Energy Flow use clear, well - thought - out concept maps during instruction. If students do not understand the concepts better with the aid of a concept map than without one, then the concept map is probably not well designed and should be discarded. Student - generated concepts maps provide teachers with a window into their pupils ' cognitive maps or schemas. Student - generated concept maps are often highly personalized and idiosyncratic and may therefore have little use in the instruction c09.indd 180 c09.indd 180 5/9/08 2:33:35 PM 5/9/08 2:33:35 PMGraphic Organizers for Science 181 of others. T eachers should employ well - structured concept maps during direct instruction but encourage students to develop their own concept maps when brainstorming new ideas or represent-ing established ones. Student concept maps in this activity will vary depending on student knowledge and schemas. James Burke, a well - known historian of tech - nology, stated that scienti c discoveries or technological advances occur when people make connections between previously unrelated topics, creating new applications for novel situations. Burke has published numerous books and movies on creativity and invention. 4 He asks his readers and viewers seemingly bizarre questions such as: \" How was Napoleon important to the develop-ment of the modern computer? \" Through his books and movies, Burke shows how scientists and inventors make connections between many seem-ingly unrelated things in the process of making new inventions. Y ou may wish to encourage your students to develop concept maps of such stories from such books and movies. Concept mapping is a great way to illustrate the interconnectedness of science and technology and may help students understand the importance of developing their own mental webs. ACTIVITY 9.5.1 Developing a Concept Map for a Complex Concept: Nuclear Winter Researchers have proposed that the climate of the Earth could become inhospitably cold in the event of a large - scale nuclear war. Nuclear explosions create a huge amount of dust and initiate numer-ous building, forest, and brush res. These events could propel vast amounts of smoke and dust into the stratosphere, an otherwise stable layer of the atmosphere. Dust and smoke in the stratosphere could refl ect much sunlight before it reaches Earth. Winds in the stratosphere could distribute the dust evenly around the Earth, causing surface temperatures to drop as much as 20 C due to the increased refl ection of light back into space. The lack of sunlight and resulting decrease in global temperature could reduce the amount of photo-synthesis, and thereby reduce available food and oxygen supplies, disrupting all life that depends on plants. Nitrogen oxides produced during nuclear explosions could lead to a rapid degradation of the ozone layer and a dramatic increase in the amount of ultraviolet light reaching the surface of the Earth. Increased ultraviolet radiation could kill sensitive phytoplankton in the oceans, upsetting oceanic food chains that are dependent on them. The complex implications of a nuclear winter are better understood with the use of a concept map. Reread this paragraph, and draw a concept map showing the relationship between variables and processes. ACTIVITY 9.5.2 Developing a Concept Map for a Food Web Develop a concept map for a terrestrial food web with the organisms listed below. Arrows should point from food to the consumer, showing the fl ow of energy and nutrients. Primary producers: grasses, shrubs, trees Primary consumers: rabbits, squirrels, mice, seed - eating birds, herbivorous insects Secondary, tertiary, and quaternary consum- ers: spiders, predaceous insects, insectivorous vore beetles Decomposers: fungi, bacteria ACTIVITY 9.5.3 Developing Concept Maps to Trace the Invention of New Tech nologies History records that Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, Alexander Graham Bell the telephone, and Jonas Salk the polio vaccine. Although they deserve credit for their inventions, it should be noted that they were successful only because they were able to connect the ideas of others. For exam-ple, to invent the light bulb, Edison had to connect the technologies and ndings of many who pre- ceded him, as the following paragraph details. At the base of a light bulb are two electrodes that connect to opposite ends of a thin metal la- ment suspended in a glass bulb lled with an inert gas, such as argon. When the bulb is connected to The Sourcebook for Teaching Science a power supply, an electric current fl ows through the thin lament, which heats up due to its small width and high resistance. The lament glows when it reaches a certain temperature but does not ignite because of the inert atmosphere in the bulb. T o invent the light bulb, it was necessary to tie together the following inventions and discoveries: electricity, battery or power supply, electrical con- ductors, glass, arg on or other inert gas, and a carbon or tungsten lament. Develop a concept map that shows how prior discoveries or inventions were essential to the development of the light bulb or other invention. ACTIVITY 9.5.4 Developing Your Own Concept Maps Develop a concept map for a topic of your own interest or one of the options that follows.

Figure 9.11 shows a Venn diagram for four sets of numbers, and diagrams for larger sets are even more unwieldy. A series of potential Venn diagram ideas is provided in the student section, but teachers and students are encouraged to develop their own comparisons from material in their curriculum. Student diagrams will differ from one another depend-ing on the items compared. If you wish to standardize Venn activities for easy, consistent grading, we suggest that you place a list of potential words and phrases out-side of the diagram so that students can simply move them into the appropriate cells. Figure 9.12 is a sample diagram for a rather complex comparison of the three photosynthetic pathways, C3, C4, and CAM, that could be derived from student Internet or library research (Activity 9.2.1). Venn diagrams are easy for two or three dimensions, but get increasingly complex and less use-ful when comparing larger sets of numbers. 9.3.1 This section introduces students to the standard fl owcharting symbols. It should be clari ed that fl ow- chart symbols are conventional but not universal. For example, Figure 9.13 is a valid fl owchart for classify- ing matter, although it does not use standard fl owchart conventions. Student fl owcharts will vary. 9.4.1 - 9.4.3 Student mind maps will vary depending on the connections they have made. 9.5.1 - 9.5.4 Student concept maps will vary. 182 5/9/08 2:33:36 C3 CAMphotosynthetic pathway fixes carbon most plants succulentsproduces sugars releases oxygen advantage in high light conserves waterfirst product is C4 sugarfirst product in photosynthesis isC3 sugarfirst product is C4 sugar \u2014 OAA sugar - malatetropical grasses maizesugar canelight reactions in mesophyll cells 2 types of chloroplasts 1 type of chloroplast CO 2 fixation and assimilation separated by timeCO2 fixation & assimilation separated by spaceCO2 fixation & assimilation in same cells light reactions in bundle sheathstomata open during daylight stomata open at night very drought tolerantadvantage in low light Figure 9.12 Venn Diagrams of Photosynthetic Pathways matter pure mixtures compounds elementsheterogeneous mixtureshomogeneous mixtures glucose, water carbon dioxideH, O, C, N P, Si, Mggranite, stew lithosphereseawater, air bronze, brassexamplesexamples examples examplesCan it be separatedby physical means?

Analogies are one of the major tools learn-ers and teachers use in the process of making these connections. Analogical reasoning is therefore a key process in human cognition. An analogy is a comparison between two dif- ferent things that demonstrate a similarity in one or more key aspects. Analogies help learn-ers understand new concepts by highlighting similarities to familiar ones. Learners understand the new concept more easily if they can relate it to something with which they are familiar. For example, most students nd it dif cult to visualize the structure of DNA when it is described as \" a double helix in which the complementary spiral strands are connected by base pairs, \" but they can readily grasp the basic structure when it is analo-gized to a spiral staircase. The spiral staircase analogy allows the student to conceptualize the structure of DNA by relating this new concept to one with which he or she is familiar. An analogy is similar to a metaphor, but while metaphors are implicit, analogies are explicit. A metaphor is the use of a word or phrase to make an implicit comparison between two things. Metaphors are frequently used in literature but may also appear in science texts. For example, a building is often used as a metaphor for a theory: \" A theory should have a good foundation and provide a framework for understanding new knowledge. c10.indd 184 c10.indd 184 5/9/08 5:59:29 PM 5/9/08 5:59:29 PMLearning Science Concepts with Analogies 185 principles of geometry and physics. However, it is inappropriate to reason that because masses always attract each other, charges therefore always attract. A naive learner who reasons by analogy often develops such a misconception. Like any other analogy, the analogy between Newton ' s law and Coulomb ' s law has strict limitations, and it is important that learners understand such limita-tions so they can bene t from analogies without drawing false conclusions. Teaching with Analogies T eachers use analogies throughout their lessons, especially when responding to student questions. When a teacher says phrases such as \" similarly, \" \" likewise, \" \" in the same way as, \" \" in comparison to, \" and \" just like, \" he or she is generally using analogies to help students grasp a concept. But if those analogies are not well chosen or applied systematically, they may be ineffective or cause confusion. T o maximize the bene t of analogies while minimizing the dangers, we suggest that educators employ the teaching with analogies (TWA) strat-egy introduced by Glynn, Duit, and Thiele. 2 T h i s strategy models what expert teachers and authors employ when using analogies. In the TWA strat-egy, shared attributes between the analogue and target are known as mappings. The goal is to trans- fer ideas from a familiar concept (the analogue) to an unfamiliar one (the target) by mapping their relationship. The TWA model consists of six operations: 1. Introduce the target concept. 2. Review the analogue concept. If it is built on shaky assumptions rather than solid data, it will collapse. To stand the test of time it must be supported and buttressed with experimen- tal results. \" The reader understands that metaphors make implicit comparisons and are not to be taken literally. Similarly, the reader must understand that an analogy is an explicit comparison with de nite limitations and should not be extended too far. We use metaphors and analogies in our understand-ing of unfamiliar facts and phenomena, grasping abstract ideas, creative thinking, and communicat-ing our ideas to others. The prior knowledge in an analogy is known as analogue, source, base, or anchor, and the new information or situation is known as the target. Analogical reasoning requires a mapping of rela-tional structure and involves the identi cation and transfer of structural information from a known system to a new and relatively unknown system. Analogies are frequently used in science text- books as well as in classrooms as an aid to the teaching - learning process. Many science teach-ers generate analogies spontaneously in order to facilitate students ' perception and understand-ing. Analogies may be very helpful in the learn-ing process, but they must be handled with care, or they can lead to misconceptions. For example, many teachers analogize the structure of an atom to that of the solar system. Both have a center (sun or nucleus) about which revolve smaller struc-tures (planets or electrons), which rotate on their own axes (electron spin or planetary rotation). Although this analogy is helpful, its limitations must be clear. For example, planets vary in size, but electrons do not, and planets follow prescribed paths, whereas electrons occupy nebulous orbitals. Students must learn to generate and use analogies but avoid the temptation to reason by analogy. For example, it may be useful to draw an analogy between Newton ' s universal law of gravitation (the analogue) and Coulomb ' s law of electrical force (the target). In both laws, the force generated is directly related to the product of the objects (mass or charge) involved and inversely related to the square of the distance between them. The similarity of the equations (Figure 10.1 ) helps illustrate that there are 4r2Fe=kQ1Q2 PM186 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science 3. Identify the relevant features of target and analogue. 4. Map similarities between the target and analogue. 5. Indicate the limitations of the analogy. 6. Draw conclusions. The following example illustrates the use of the TWA strategy when introducing the concept of a pulsar by analogizing it to the rotating lamp in a lighthouse: 1 . Introduce the target concept. A pulsar is a rotat- ing neutron start that emits radio waves in a narrow beam at regular intervals. 2 . Review the analogue concept. A lighthouse con- tains a lamp that rotates on an axis and emits light beams to viewers at regular intervals. 3 . Identify the relevant features of target and ana- logue. The relevant features are the source of electromagnetic radiation, the axis of rota-tion, the rotating source, the distant observer, and the appearance of pulsating energy. 4 . Map similarities between the target and ana- logue. The neutron star at the core of the pulsar is analogous to the lamp in a light-house since both emit electromagnetic radia-tion. The spinning of the pulsar is analogous to rotation of the lamp. The earthbound astronomer who observes pulsating energy from a pulsar is analogous to the seafarer who observes pulsating light from the lighthouse. 5 . Indicate the limitations of the analogy. The pulsar rotates at a rate of perhaps 30 times per second, while the lighthouse light rotates much more slowly. The energy emitted from the pulsar is primarily in the form of radio waves, while the energy from the lighthouse is primarily in the form of visible light. While the beam of light from a lighthouse is at right angles to the lamp ' s axis of rotation, the beam of energy from the pulsar may be at various angles depending on the alignment of the magnetic pole relative to the axis of rotation. 6 . Draw conclusions. The student develops a basic understanding of the pulsar by analogy to the lamp in a lighthouse. When student understanding does not match teacher expectation, it is often because there has been a failure at steps 2, 4, or 5, as the following example illustrates. Over the years, many biol-ogy teachers and texts have described mitochon-dria as the powerhouses of the cell. The question is, How many students have ever been to a power-house or know what it does? The analogy, although potentially a good one, adds little to student understanding because there is insuf cient under- standing of the analogue, much less the mappings between it and the target. The analogy is useful if the teacher rst makes certain that students under- stand that a powerhouse is a place where energy is converted from a readily available but unusable form into an easily usable form. For example, the powerhouse at the base of a hydroelectric dam con-verts the kinetic energy of falling water into elec-tricity that can then be distributed through power lines to homes and businesses, where it can be used to power various devices. Similarly, the powerhouse at a coal - burning power plant converts the chemi-cal potential energy in coal to thermal energy in the boiler rooms, and ultimately to electrical energy that can once again be distributed and used. Understanding the analogue, we are now able to map similarities between it (the powerhouse) and the target (mitochondria). The primary func-tion of mitochondria is to convert energy from the chemical bonds in glucose molecules into the bonds of ATP , a form of energy that can be distributed and used throughout the cell. This is analogous to the function of a powerhouse, which converts energy from an available but impractical form, such as nuclear energy (nuclear reactor), kinetic energy (windmills or hydroelectric plants), or chemical bond energy (coal power generation plant), into electricity, a form of energy that can be easily dis-tributed and used. In this analogy, coal or other raw energy source is analogous to glucose, ATP is analogous to electricity, the mitochondria are analogous to the powerhouse, the cell is analogous to a municipality, and the processes that consume ATP in the cell are analogous to all of those proc-esses in the city that rely on electricity. Although this analogy is an excellent one, it has limitations. For example, unlike a powerhouse that can distribute c10.indd 186 c10.indd 186 5/9/08 5:59:32 PM 5/9/08 5:59:32 PMLearning Science Concepts with Analogies 187 energy almost immediately through conducting wires, the mitochondria distribute ATP slowly through the process of diffusion to surrounding organelles. And unlike a powerhouse that converts energy from one form to a totally different form (say, from nuclear energy to electrical energy), the mitochondria simply convert it from one type of chemical bond energy to another more usable form. Analogies are a tool to help learners develop meaning as they relate new concepts (targets) to familiar ones (analogues). If, however, teachers don ' t recognize when students ' existing concepts are fl awed, then analogies may confuse the situ- ation. For this reason, it is important that the teacher and student hold a common view of the analogue before mapping begins. In the activities in this chapter, learners are introduced to a variety of classic and new analo-gies that can be used when teaching or learning biology, chemistry, physics, and earth and space science. After reading the analogies, the students will be asked to generate and explain analogies of their own. I suggest that teachers carefully read and introduce each example using the TWA strat-egy, adding further explanation as necessary. 10.1 Extended Science Analogies Some analogies can be extended much further than others because of intrinsic similarities bet-ween the target and analogue concepts. In this section are three extended analogies to illustrate the length to which analogies can be developed. T eachers are encouraged to develop their own analogies and direct students to do the same. When introducing new concepts by analogy to previously learned concepts, teachers must clearly state the limitations so students do not begin to reason by analogy and draw false conclusions. ACTIVITY 10.1.1 Electrical Circuit/Plumbing Analogy Electricity is an important topic in physics and a vital feature of everyday life, yet it is dif cult to understand because it cannot be seen or handled. T o concep- tualize electricity, it is helpful to draw an analogy between DC electric circuits and plumbing systems. In such an analogy, electricity is the primary target, and the plumbing system is the primary analogue, but there are numerous other targets and analogues that will be discussed as the analogy is developed. Like all other analogies, the relationship between the target and analogue is limited to the features dis-cussed. No conclusions should be drawn about the nature of electricity by extending the analogy. T arget concept: In a direct current (DC) cir- cuit, the voltage ( V, volts) of a battery is a meas- ure of the available energy per unit charge, which drives the electric current (I, amperes) around a closed circuit. An increase in electrical resistance ( R, ohms) results in a decrease in current. Analogue concept: In a plumbing system, the pressure difference ( /H9004 P, kPa) generated by a pump is a measure of the energy per unit volume, which drives the fl ow of water ( F, cm 3 /s) through the pipes. An increase in the magnitude of a restriction results in a decrease in fl ow. Relevant features/and mapping: Refer to Table 10.1 and Figure 10.2 . The numbers in parentheses in the list that follows refer to the numbers in Figure 10.2 : battery pump: A battery (1) converts chemical energy to electrical energy to drive an electric current through a conductor, just as an elec -tric pump (1) converts electrical energy to kinetic energy to move water through a conduit. The strength of a battery is measured in volts (V), while the strength of a pump is measured in kil-opascals (kPa). A battery takes in charge at low voltage (4), performs work on it, and releases it at high voltage (3). This is analogous to a pump that takes in water at low pressure (4), performs work on it, and releases it at high pressure (3). voltage (potential difference) pressure: Volt age (3) is a measure of the energy per unit charge available to drive charges through a circuit. This is analogous to fl uid pressure (3), which is a measure of the energy per unit volume available to drive water through a plumbing circuit (see Figure 10.2 ). If all other factors are held constant, an increase in voltage causes c10.indd 187 c10.indd 187 5/9/08 5:59:33 PM 5/9/08 5:59:33 PM188 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science of water in a conduit or pipe (2). As the names imply, condu ctors and condu its conduct things from one region to another. Increasing the diam- eter of a conducting wire (11,10) increases the fl ow of electricity, just as increasing the diameter of a pipe (11,10) increases the fl ow of water. Electricity will fl ow through a wire made of conductive material but not through a wire made of an insulating material (12) such as plastic or nylon. Similarly, water will fl ow through an open pipe but not through a clogged pipe (12). closed circuit closed loop: Breaking a circuit with a switch (9) is analogous to breaking the fl ow of water in a pipe by closing a gate valve (9). A closed switch is analogous to an open valve in the plumbing analogy. An open circuit has voltage but no current because it has \" in - nite \" resistance, just as a closed faucet has pressure but no fl ow due to high resistance. resistance restriction: Electrical resistance is the opposition to the fl ow of electricity. Appliances such as lights, toasters, and refrigerators offer resistance and are referred to as \" loads \" on the circuit. Resistance (5) to electric current by an appliance is analogous to the restriction (5) in a plumbing line. A thin wire (11) restricts fl ow and is analogous to a narrow pipe (11). voltage drop pressure drop: The electrical resistance of an appliance or resistor is so great compared to the copper wire that delivers the current that the voltage drop for a circuit is seen primarily across the appliance (5). This is analogous to the pressure drop across a pipe restriction or turbine (5). Ammeter Flowmeter: An ammeter (7) is placed in series in a circuit to measure the current (6) just like a fl owmeter (7) is placed in series in a pipe to measure the fl ow rate (6). electrical ground reservoir: A ground wire (8) supplies charge to a circuit while hold-ing the voltage of the adjacent wires steady at the voltage of the earth. This is analogous to a reservoir (8) that supplies water to a plumb- ing system while holding the pressure of the adjacent pipes at the pressure of the reservoir. A ground provides a voltage reference for a system but is not part of the circuit, just Table 10.1 DC Circuit/Plumbing Analogy DC Circuit Water System voltage pressure energy/charge energy/volumejoule/coulomb joule/m 3 volt pascal battery pump chemical electrical electrical kinetic drives current in dc circuitdrives water in plumbing takes in charge at low voltagetakes in water at low pressure releases charge at high voltagereleases water at high pressure current volume fl ow rate coulombs/s (amps) m3/s conductor conduit (pipe) diameter current diameter fl ow conductive material open pipenonconductive material clogged pipe closed circuit closed loop switch valveclosed switch open valve resistance resistance small wire restrictionelectrical appliance voltage dropammeterammeter placed in serieswater-powered appliance pressure dropfl owmeter fl owmeter placed in series an increase in current just as an increase in pressure causes an increase in the fl ow of water. Voltage is measured in volts (joule/cou-lomb) while pressure is measured in kilopas-cals (kilojoules/cubic meter). current fl ow rate: Current is a measure of the fl ow of electric charge through a conduc- tor, just as fl ow rate is a measure of the fl ow of fl uid through a conduit (pipe). Current is measured in coulombs/s (amps), while vol-ume fl ow is measure in m 3 /s. conductor conduit: The fl ow of charge in an electrical conductor (2) is analogous to the fl ow Analogies 189(1) battery (6) current(2) conductor (3) high voltage (4) low voltage(5) resistance (7) ammeter (8) ground(9) switch (10) thick conductor(11) thin conductor(12) insulatorEraser (1) Pump(2) conduit (3) high pressure (4) low pressure(5) restriction (6) flow rate (7) flow- meter (8) reservoir(9) valve (10) thick conduit(11) thin conduit(12) blocked conduit Figure 10.2 DC Circuit Plumbing Analogy as a reservoir provides a pressure reference for a plumbing loop but is not part of that loop. speed of electricity speed of water: When you fl ip a light switch, lights immediately glow, even though electrons move rather slowly. Similarly, when you open a spigot, water immediately fl ows, even though water trav- els rather slowly. In a conductor, electrons \" push \" adjacent electrons down the length of the wire and produce an immediate effect. Similarly, in pipes, water molecules \" push \" adjacent water molecules to produce an immediate effect. Limitations of analogy: Although this is an excellent and time - tested analogy, it has many limitations. For example, if a pipe is cut, water will fl ow out, but if a wire is cut, electrons will not fl ow out. In addition, the current in a pipe results from the fl ow of the contents of that pipe. By con- trast, the atoms of copper stay in a copper wire, even though electricity fl ows through it. Student project: Illustrate and explain this anal- ogy with a poster, Web page, PowerPoint, or model. ACTIVITY 10.1.2 Electron Energy Diagram/ Parking Structure Analogy An understanding of electron energy is founda-tional to the study of chemistry, yet it is dif cult to develop because both electrons and energy are abstract concepts. An analogy to a parking struc-ture can facilitate understanding. T arget concept: Each electron in an atom has a unique energy address. When identifying an electron, we specify the (1) principal quantum number, n, indicating distance from the nucleus; the (2) angular momentum quantum number, l, indicating the shape of the orbital; the (3) mag-netic quantum number, m l , indicating the orien- tation of the orbital; and the (4) spin quantum number, m S , indicating if the electron is spin- ning clockwise or counterclockwise (these terms have meaning only as opposites to each other in the same atom). The combination of the rst three quantum numbers gives the probability of nding an electron in a given region (atomic orbital) while the fourth speci es the spin of the electron on its axis (clockwise or counterclockwise). Figure 10.3 shows an electron energy diagram. 189 189 5/9/08 5:59:34 PM 5/9/08 5:59:34 Sourcebook for Teaching Science structure rst, so electrons ll the lowest energy positions rst. Relevant features and mapping: Features of the electron energy diagram can be mapped to the parking structure in these ways: electron car: Electrons in an atom are analo- gous to cars of the same make and model in a parking structure. Just as the cars in our analogy have identical mass, so all electrons have identical mass. The energy of a car in our parking structure analogy is a function of its position. The higher a parking space, the higher the car ' s energy.

In reality, the positions are not fixed. In other words, the x, y, and z orbitals in a given p subshell have the same energy and are just as likely to fill first. Thus, the magnetic and spin numbers identified in the key do not represent absolute positions.xy d f Figure 10.3 Electron Energy Diagram cross-section of parking structureonly one car per slot Figure 10.4 Electron Energy Diagram Analogy Analogue concept: An electron energy dia- gram is analogous to a parking structure built on a hill (Figure 10.4 ). On the ground fl oor there are relatively few parking spots, but as you drive higher, there are progressively more spaces. Just as cars tend to ll the lowest spots in a parking c10.indd 190 c10.indd 190 5/9/08 5:59:35 PM 5/9/08 5:59:35 PMLearning Science Concepts with Analogies 191 of an electron is a function of the orbital it occupies within the atom. electron energy e n e r g y o f c a r : The energy address of an electron is determined by its distance from the nucleus, shape of its orbital, orientation of its orbital, and the direction of its spin. The \" address \" of a car in a park-ing structure is a function of the level where it is parked, the row, the position within the row, and the direction in which it is point-ing. A car parked in the uphill side of the top row of the top level of a parking structure has much more potential energy than a car on the downhill side of the rst row of the rst level. Similarly, an electron at a higher level with a complex orbital has more energy than one at a lower level with a simpler shape. electrostatic attraction gravity: Electrons are negatively charged particles and are attracted to the positively charged nuclei around which they orbit. The attraction between electrons and the protons of the nucleus is analogous to the pull of gravity on the cars in a structure. Just as it takes more energy to drive to the top of a parking structure, so it takes more energy to move an electron to a higher shell. electron states parking structure: According to the principles of quantum mechanics, elec-trons in an atom can occupy only speci c energy levels. In the same way, cars entering a parking structure can park only in speci c spaces demarcated by white lines. Just as the hillside parking structure has more space as you increase levels, so an atom has more orbit-als as you get farther from the nucleus. Pauli exclusion principle one car per space: The Pauli - exclusion principle states that no two electrons can have the same quantum num-bers, just as no two cars can occupy exactly the same parking space. energy address position of car: We can iden- tify the energy of an electron by a unique address, just as we can identify the location of car by giving a speci c address. For example, the outermost electron in carbon is located in the second level, where it is found in a p - orbital with an x - orientation and a clockwise spin. Similarly, we could say that a car is located on the second level of a parking struc-ture, where it is found in the second section, in the second row, facing north. principal quantum number, n level in the park- ing structure: The principal quantum number for an electron designates the energy of the shell and is related to the average distance of the elec-tron from the nucleus. The higher the level, the more energetic the electron. This is analogous to the levels of a parking structure. An electron with a higher principal quantum number has more energy than one with a lower number, just as a car at a higher level in the garage has more potential energy than one at a lower level. subsidiary quantum number orbitals, l (s,p,d,f) position in level: The subsidiary quantum number, describing the shape of the subshell (s,p,d,f) that the electron occupies is a second-ary feature related to the energy of electrons. Large parking structures have sloped fl oors, and cars in spaces in the region closer to the entrance ramp have less energy than those farthest from it. Similarly, electrons in the rst regions within a shell, such as s and p, have less energy than those in the last regions within a shell, such as d, and f. magnetic quantum number, m parking row: The magnetic quantum number designates the orientation of the charge cloud in space. This is analogous to the parking rows in a garage, each of which may have a different angle. spin quantum number, s direction parked: The spin quantum number speci es the direction of spin of the electron on its own axis. An electron can spin clockwise or counterclock-wise. For every possible combination of n, l, and m, there can be two electrons, one spin- ning clockwise and the other counterclock-wise. This is analogous to parking spaces in which cars park in opposite directions as they head into opposing slots. electron positions order the garage is lled: Electrons in a stable atom occupy the lowest possible energy levels or orbitals. This is analo-gous to the way most parking garages ll. The rst spots to ll are those closest to the entrance because they require the least energy to reach. c10.indd 191 c10.indd 191 5/9/08 5:59:35 PM 5/9/08 5:59:35 PM192 Sourcebook for Teaching Science energy release by falling electrons energy released by rolling car: If an electron is at a higher energy address, it may spontaneously fall to a lower energy address and release light in the process. This is analogous to a car that occupies a space at the top of a parking structure that may roll to a lower level, releasing energy to charge the battery and heat the brakes. Limitations: Like all other analogies, this has many limitations, a couple of which are men-tioned here. In the parking lot analogy, the energy differences in cars resulted from differences in height above the ground. By contrast, the energy differences in an atom are due to a variety of fac-tors other than distance, including the shape of the orbital, the orientation of the orbital, and the direction of electron spin. In addition, electrons are in constant motion, whereas the cars in this analogy are xed in parking spaces. Student activity: The best way to learn something is to teach another. Students should explain the electron energy diagram to a partner using this extended analogy. Read the analogy rst, and then put it in your own words as you explain it to another student. ACTIVITY 10.1.3 Cell/Factory Analogy The cell is the basic unit of living systems. Although it is relatively easy to visualize the components of cells, it is dif cult to conceptualize how these com- ponents function together to sustain life within the cell. T o develop an understanding of the functional processes that take place in a cell, it is helpful to draw an analogy to an automobile factory. Target concept: The dictionary de nes a cell as \" the smallest independently functioning unit in the structure of an organism, usually consisting of one or more nuclei surrounded by cytoplasm and enclosed in a membrane. \" Although this is a relatively accurate description, it is not an intui-tive description that students can readily relate to. Because cells are microscopic, dif cult to visual- ize in three dimensions, and exceedingly complex in function, most teachers draw analogies to help students grasp their signi cance. It is common to hear teachers draw analogies between cells and cities, schools, and factories. In this example, we are illustrating an analogy between a cell and a factory, but others can be equally well developed. Analogue concept: An analogy is helpful only when people are familiar with the analogue con-cept, in this case, a factory. Relatively few students have visited factories, and so it is helpful to review the organization of a factory as the analogy is developed. A factory is a facility where goods are manufactured for export. It consumes raw materi-als and energy in an effort to sustain its workers and provide resources to others. This is analogous to the functioning of a cell (Figure 10.5 ), as the following mapping explains. Relevant features and mapping: cell factory: A cell (in a multicellular organ- ism) is an identi able unit that is part of a larger organism, just as a factory is an iden-ti able unit that is part of society. A cell uses material and energy resources and produces products, just as a factory does. cell products factory products: Cells do not work in isolation; they provide and receive resources from other cells or the surrounding environ-ment. Factories produce products so that they may be sold and earn money for the corpora-tion. Similarly, cells produce products that may be used by surrounding cells and in turn receive resources from surrounding cells. For example, cells in the beta islets of Langerhans in the pan-creas produce insulin that surrounding cells use. Simultaneously, these same cells receive oxygen and nutrients provided by the red blood cells and plasma that fl ow in their neighborhood. organelle membranes walls: In factories, walls are used to separate regions with different functions. For example, the paint room is sep-arated from the upholstery shop so each can carry on its functions without interference from the other. Similarly, organelle mem-branes separate organelles from the cytoplasm, allowing them to have different functions than the cytoplasm in which they are immersed. nucleus headquarters: The nucleus of a cell con- trols the operations of a cell. In a similar man-ner, factory headquarters controls the operations c10.indd 192 c10.indd 192 5:59:36 PM 10.5 Some of the Many Analogies for a Cell of a factory. The nucleus is separated from the rest of the cell by a nuclear membrane that allows it to function without interruption from surrounding organelles, just as the of ce walls of the headquarters allow planners and managers to direct the operations of the factory without being distracted by surrounding operations. nuclear pore doors: Communication is essential to the proper functioning of a factory. Doors allow people from different departments to visit and communicate. In a similar manner, nuclear pores allow information and resources to fl ow between the nucleus and the cell it manages. DNA/chromosome plans: Each factory has plans that govern the production and development of their products, as well as plans that govern the day - to - day operation of the factory. DNA is analogous to such plans, providing the code not only for all cell products but also the proteins that govern daily operations within the cell. smooth endoplasmic reticulum hallways: Fac- tories have hallways through which informa-tion from the of ce travels to the workers in all departments. Similarly, the cell has smooth endoplasmic reticulum through which it is believed that messenger RNA (mRNA) travels from the nucleus to places where it is decoded. ribosome worker: Factory workers translate instructions from headquarters into products. In an analogous fashion, ribosomes are the site where m - RNA is translated into proteins. rough endoplasmic reticulum assembly line: Workers gather in regions of the factory where assembly takes place. Similarly, ribosomes are positioned on rough endoplasmic reticulum, where the proteins are assembled. protein product: Factories produce products for internal and external use. Similarly, cells produce proteins for internal use and for export. Proteins result when DNA code has been transcribed into RNA and translated into polypeptide chains. Similarly, factory products result when plans from the of ce are copied and distributed to workers, who combine vari-ous components to assemble a product. cytoplasm stockroom: A factory needs a stock- room from which parts can be taken for use on the assembly line. Similarly, resources are c10.indd 193 c10.indd 193 5/9/08 5:59:36 PM 5/9/08 5:59:36 Sourcebook for Teaching Science distributed through the cytoplasm until they are used by surrounding organelles. mRNA photocopy: Although the master plans of a company may be protected in the factory headquarters, individual plans may be pho-tocopied from these plans and distributed to workers as needed. mRNA is like a photocopy of DNA that accurately transmits data from the nucleus to the ribosomes, where it is trans-lated into useful proteins. tRNA stockroom helpers: Stockroom helpers bring components to the assembly line where they can be combined into products. Similarly, tRNA (transfer RNA) brings amino acids from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes where assemblage of proteins may take place. mitochondrion powerhouse: A powerhouse converts energy from one form to another. For example, the powerhouse at a hydroelec-tric dam converts the kinetic energy of falling water into electrical energy for distribution to homes and businesses. In a similar manner, mitochondria convert energy from the bonds in glucose to the phosphate bonds of ATP . ATP electricity: Electricity is a fl exible energy source that can be easily distributed to homes and businesses. Similarly, ATP is a fl exible energy source that is used to power the growth, movement, and metabolism of the cell. Golgi apparatus warehouse: Products from a factory are generally stored in a warehouse before exporting. The Golgi apparatus may serve as a warehouse where proteins are stored prior to export. Limitations: This analogy should not be ex - tended to cell division. Whereas industries grow by the addition of new factories, cells grow by the splitting and growth of existing cells. Thus, stu-dents should not try to nd analogues for such things as asters, centrioles, and spindle bers. Student activity: Working in a team, develop a new analogy for a cell. Y ou may wish to analogize a cell to a city, your school, your home, or another entity of your choice. ACTIVITY 10.1.4 Granite/Ice Cream Analogy Granite is a coarse to medium - grained intrusive igneous rock. It contains much quartz and feld-spar and is the most common rock in the Earth ' s crust. It is a plutonic rock, forming as magma cools inside the Earth. Granite is frequently used to build monuments, face buildings, and cover kitchen counters. Y osemite ' s famed Half Dome (Figure 10.6 ) and many other mountain peaks are made entirely of granite. T arget concept: Although there are many vari- ations of granite, all contain large percentages of quartz and feldspar. Granite is classi ed by the presence of schlieren, xenoliths, embedded miner-als, and key additives. Analogue concept: There are a variety of ice creams, just as there are a variety of quartz rocks. Although there are many types of ice cream, all share some common ingredients. By analogy, there are different varieties of granites, but all share some common minerals. Relevant features and mapping: rock composition ingredients: Both rocks and ice cream contain a few basic components. Ice cream contains milk, cream, and sugar, and granite contains feldspars and quartz. Figure 10.6 Granite: A Common Plutonic PMLearning Concepts with Analogies 195 rock formation ice cream formation: Both granite and ice cream start out as liquids that solidify when the temperature is decreased suf ciently. Both are crystalline solids that sof- ten as they warm. variation fl avor: The three basic fl avors of ice cream are chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla. The three basic types of granite are peralkaline, pera-luminous, and metaluminous, indicating high concentrations of sodium and potassium, alu-minum, or intermediate concentrations of each. xenoliths candies: Some ice creams contain candy bars or cookies that are of quite different origin from the ice cream. These are analogous to xenoliths, rocks from the outside that became embedded at the time granite was forming. shapes forms: Granite forms as dikes (upright sheets), batholiths (large round masses), and other shapes. Similarly, ice cream is formed into cones, cups, sandwiches, and other shapes. biotite and hornblende chips and nuts: Many ice creams contain embedded chocolate or mint chips or nuts. Hornblende and biotite are common minerals embedded in granite. schlieren swirls: Ice creams may have swirls of different fl avors of ice cream. These are analo- gous to schlieren, layers of dark minerals that occur within the granite. Limitations: Ice cream freezes at temperatures slightly below 0 C, while granite solidi es at tem- peratures of approximately /H11002 650 C. All granite can be categorized as peralkaline, peraluminous, or metaluminous, but not all ice cream can be cat-egorized as chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla. These are a few of the many limitations of this analogy. Student activity: Create your own analogy for sedimentary or metamorphic rock. 10.2 Analogies for Learning Physics Following are some classic analogies in physics. Read through these before trying to generate your own analogies. Note that graphs and gures may be helpful in making an effective analogy: Angular velocity is analogous to linear velocity. Linear velocity is the rate of change in position with respect to time. This is analogous to angular velocity, which is de ned as the change in angle with respect to time. Both angular and linear velocity are vector quantities: /H9275/H9258 /H11005/H9004 /H9004/H9004 /H9004 tvd tis analogous to = Coulomb ' s law of electrical force is analogous to Newton ' s universal law of gravitation. The electrical force created by two charges is propor-tional to the product of their charges but inversely proportional to the square of the distance between these charges. Similarly, gravitational force is proportional to the product of two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the dis-tances between them: Fkqq dFGmm dcg /H110051 21 2is analogous to22= Electromagnetic waves are analogous to water waves. Although water waves and electromag- netic waves are vastly different in nature, both transmit energy without transmitting matter. Both are disturbances that move from one region to another and demonstrate refraction, refl ec- tion, diffraction, and interference. One of the best ways to illustrate these features of electromagnetic radiation (e.g., X - rays, ultraviolet, visible, radio) is by analogy to water waves. A wave tank can be made from a large glass cake pan and placed on an overhead projector. Wave fronts can be gener-ated by moving a short plastic ruler in and out of the water, and point sources can be generated by touching the water with the blunt end of a pen-cil. Figure 10.7 demonstrates the patterns that can be projected on the screen to explain various wave interactions of electromagnetic radiation by analogy to water waves. Refl ection of light is analogous to the bounce of a ball. When light refl ects off a mirror, the angle of refl ection is equal to the angle of incidence. This is analogous to the bounce of a ball off a backboard in which the angle of refl ection is equal to the angle of incidence (Figure 10.8 ). c10.indd 195 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science The refraction of light passing from air into a glass is analogous to the movement of a skate-board rolling from pavement to grass. When light passes obliquely from air into glass, it slows down and bends toward the normal. Similarly, a skate-board will slow down when it passes at a similar angle from a concrete sidewalk to grass. Glass has a higher optical density than air, causing a wave front of light to slow and bend. Similarly, grass has a higher coef cient of friction than con- crete, causing the rst wheel of a skateboard to slow, thereby changing the angle of refraction (Figure 10.9 ). Red shift in stars is analogous to the Doppler shift of sound. Astronomers have noted that the light from distant stars is shifted toward the red end of the spectrum (lower frequency), indicating that they are moving away from us. This is analogous to the lower pitch (lower fre-quency) of a siren on a car moving away from us (Figure 10.10 ). ACTIVITY 10.2.1 Developing Analogies in Physics Develop analogies by explaining the similarities between the analogue and the target for each of the following: 1.

The wave mechanical model of the atom is analogous to a powerboat. 6. The emission of energy from a quasar is anal- ogous to the heat generated at the entrance to a stadium. 7. Develop an analogy for your own topic. 10.3 Analogies for Learning Chemistry The following are analogies in chemistry. Read through these before developing your own analo-gies. Note that graphs and gures may be helpful in making an effective analogy. Entropy is analogous to the state of your room. Entropy is a measure of the disorder that exists in a system. A messy room has \" high entropy \" because there are many possible ways to be messy. A neat room has \" low entropy \" because there are fewer ways to be organized and neat. The sec-ond law of thermodynamics states, \" Whenever a spontaneous event takes place in the universe, it is accompanied by an overall increase in entropy. \" In other words, the entropy of the universe is increasing, just as a room will become progres-sively messier unless energy is expended to reverse the trend. A diffusion gradient is analogous to a ball cage. Substances diffuse from a region of higher concen-tration to lower concentration. This is analogous to a ball cage found at carnivals and fast food res-taurants. The cage in which children play is lled with small, hollow plast ic balls. Piling the balls on one side of the cage creates a gradient, which with time, will return to an equilibrium situation in which the balls lie at uniform depth. Bonding is analogous to a man - on - man de - fense in basketball. In a man - on - man defense in basketball, both players in a pair desire to get and keep the basketball. If both get their hands on it but neither one controls it, they are bonded by their mutual attraction for the basketball. This is analogous to a covalent bond in which atoms are held together by a mutual attraction for shared electrons. If one of the basketball players has the ball, his defender will follow him around the court, \" attracted \" by the basketball. This is analogous to an ionic bond in which one of the species has an extra electron and is therefore negatively charged, while the other is positively charged and thereby attracted to the rst. Finally, a polar covalent bond is analogous to a situation in which both players have their hands on the basketball, but one player has it against his chest while the other is trying to retrieve it. In polar covalent bonds, the shared electrons are closer to one nucleus than the other but still under the attractive infl uence of both nuclei. Surface tension of water is analogous to the tension on a drumhead. Both a drumhead and the surface of water will resist deformation as they minimize surface area. The surface tension of water can be broken with soap and the tension of a drumhead broken with a knife. A nuclear chain reaction is analogous to fall- ing dominos. Arrange dominoes to simulate a nuclear chain reaction. Stand dominoes upright as illustrated in Figure 10.11 such that if the rst falls, it will strike two, and each of these will strike two more when they fall. The falling dominos are analogous to a nuclear chain reaction in that one reaction stimulates more than one additional reaction, which in turn stimulates more than one reaction each, and so forth. An activated complex is analogous to a win- dowsill. A re ghter entering a building by a lad- der must rst climb to the top of the sill before he or she can jump down to the fl oor. Similarly, on leaving the building, the re ghter must again climb up to the top of the sill before descending the ladder. Reacting molecules interact to produce high - energy intermediates known as activated complexes. These complexes have higher potential energy than either the reactants or products and are analogous to windowsills, which are higher than either the fl oor or the ground. c10.indd 197 PM ACTIVITY 10.3.1 Developing Analogies in Chemistry Develop analogies by explaining the similarities between the analogue and the target for each of the following: 1. Atomic spectra are analogous to ngerprints. 2. Phases of matter are analogous to stages of a school day. 3. Chemical reactions are analogous to dances. 4. Reactions are analogous to factory production. 5. Collision geometry is analogous to a jigsaw puzzle. 6. The mean free path is analogous to the move- ment of bumper cars. 7. Develop a chemistry analogy for a topic of your choice. 10.4 Analogies for Learning Biology The following are some analogies in biology. Read through these before developing your own analogies. Semipermeable membrane is analogous to a chain - link fence. Small objects like water and dust can cross the fence, while larger particles like trash and leaves are stopped by it. This is analogous to semipermeable membranes, which allow small or appropriately charged molecules through while blocking others. An enzyme is analogous to a baseball mitt. A baseball mitt facilitates catching a fl y ball, just as an enzyme facilitates a chemical reaction. A base-ball mitt conforms around a baseball but not a basketball, just as an enzyme conforms to t only speci c substrate molecules but not others. The pocket of the glove ts the substrate like the active site of an enzyme ts the substrate molecules. Homeostasis is analogous to a thermostat. Homeostasis is the tendency of an organism to maintain optimal internal conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, oxygen concentration) by regulating behavior or internal processes. If the temperature is too high, a thermostat turns on the air condi-tioning, and if it is too low, it turns on the heater. Similarly, a person whose body temperature exceeds 37 C may cool down by sweating or walk-ing to the shade, and if it drops below 37 C, the person may warm up by shivering (spontaneous muscle contraction) or by putting on a coat. Gel electrophoresis is analogous to movement through a crowd. Small children can move through a crowd faster than large adults because they can readily slip between openings in the crowd. Similarly, small strands of DNA move more rapidly around the obstructions in a gel during electro-phoresis. Thus, movement through a crowd can separate small people from large people just like electrophoresis can separate small strands from large ones. One way to illustrate this in the class-room is to have individual students walk through an array of desks and then have a string of three people who are holding hands traverse the same path. The chain of people will travel more slowly due to the obstructions. Similarly, longer chains move more slowly through gels than short chains. Transcription and translation of genetic mate- rial are similar to the transcription and translation of a book written in a different language from a ref-erence library. Just as a reference volume remains in the library, so DNA remains in the nucleus. 92U235n1 0+ 5:59:44 PM 5/9/08 5:59:44 PMLearning Science Concepts with Analogies 199 T o be useful, however, both the reference and DNA must be transcribed, taken out of the library or cell, and translated into something meaningful. For example, to use a Russian text, a worker tran-scribes text from Cyrillic (the Russian alphabet) to Roman letters (used in English). Similarly, DNA in the nucleus is transcribed from DNA into RNA, a form that is readable in the cell. Once transcribed, text can be taken from the library to workers who translate it into English. Similarly, RNA exits the nucleus and binds to the ribosomes, where it may be translated to form proteins. Biochemical reactions are analogous to the manufacturing process. Reactants are analogous to raw materials in a manufacturing process, while products are analogous to the manufac-tured goods. Enzymes are like the workers that facilitate the assembly of the goods. Both enzymes and workers facilitate the bonding or unbonding of component parts. For example, if the demand for nished cabinets is high, a cabinetmaker will facilitate the construction of cabinets, but if the demand is low, he or she may reduce out-put and even disassemble existing stock to save room in the warehouse. Similarly enzymes facili-tate the assemblage of products from reactants if the \" demand for products is high \" (the concentra-tion of products is low relative to the reactants), but may facilitate the reverse reaction if the oppo-site conditions are true. ACTIVITY 10.4.1 Developing Analogies in Biology Develop the following analogies by explaining the similarities between the analogue and the target: 1. Binomial nomenclature is analogous to human names. 2. Blood vessels are analogous to a road system. 3. The immune system is analogous to a security guard. 4. The eye is analogous to a television camera. 5. Electron transport chains are analogous to balls rolling down staircases. 6. The movement of an action potential along an axon is analogous to the movement of a spec-tator \" wave \" at a sports stadium. 7. Develop a biology analogy for a topic of your c h o i c e . 10.5 Analogies for Learning Earth and Space Science The following are analogies in earth and space science. Read these before developing your own analogies: Heating rock is analogous to heating cheese. When cheese is heated it melts. Similarly, when rock is heated, it melts. If heated to higher tem-peratures, the cheese bubbles as gases form inside the cheese. Similarly, rock bubbles if heated suf- ciently as various gases form in the molten material. Convection currents in the Earth ' s crust are analogous to convection currents in heated water. Hot water rises in the center of a pot above the fl ame and sinks on the cooler sides. This is anal- ogous to convection centers in the mantle, where rock rises at the oceanic ridge and then sinks in subduction zones at trenches. Volcanic eruption is analogous to opening a soda that has been shaken. When the lid is on, the pressure in a soda can is suf cient to keep the car- bon dioxide dissolved in the liquid, but when the cap is removed, the pressure drops, carbon dioxide bubbles form, and a froth escapes. This is analo-gous to a magma chamber in which the pressure of the overburden rock prevents the rock from frothing, but when a vent develops, the magma froth forms and expands through the vents, expel-ling large quantities of shattered rock. Pumice, a lightweight volcanic rock marked with numerous gas chambers, is evidence of this reaction. Sedimentary rock is like a club sandwich. A club sandwich, like sedimentary rock, is made from the bottom up. The top layer of both is the most recent, and the bottom layer is the oldest. The behavior of compressing or expanding gases is analogous to playing pool on a contracting or expanding pool table. T emperature is a function of the average kinetic energy of molecules. A pool ball c10.indd 199 c10.indd 199 5/9/08 5:59:45 Teaching Science refl ected off the wall of a pool table will return with approximately the same speed it had prior to the col-lision. If, however, the walls are contracting (moving toward the center) the billiard balls will rebound with greater speed. Analogously, molecules in a compress-ing environment will rebound with greater speed, and hence a greater temperature. If the pool table walls are expanding (moving away from the center) at the time of collision, the refl ected pool balls will rebound with a signi cantly lower speed. This is anal- ogous to molecules in an expanding environment. As molecules rebound, they do so with lesser speed, and hence lower kinetic energy and temperature. The retrograde motion of planets is analogous to viewing a pedestrian from a passing car. The planets beyond Earth appear to move backward as the Earth passes through the same angle from the sun. This is analogous to the appearance of a pedestrian walking the same direction as a mov-ing car. The pedestrian appears to move backward against the distant horizon as the car speeds by. Although both the driver and pedestrian are mov-ing in the same direction, the pedestrian appears to be moving backward with reference to the hori-zon when viewed by the passing driver. ACTIVITY 10.5.1 Developing Analogies in Earth and Space Science Select and develop some of the following analo-gies by explaining the similarities between the analogue and the target as well as the limitations of the analogy: 1. The relative dimensions in a cross - section of the Earth are analogous to the relative dimen-sions in the cross - section of a peach. 2. Rocks are analogous to Silly Putty. 3. The formation of spiral galaxies is analogous to the formation of pizza crust from raw dough. 4. Pulsars are analogous to lights on emergency vehicles. 5. Space - time is analogous to a trampoline. 6. The expanding universe is analogous to a ris- ing loaf of raisin bread. 7. Develop an Earth or space science analogy for a topic of your choice. Answers to Chapter Activities 10.1.1 - 10.1.4 The problems in section 10.1 require students to discover relationships within a set of established parameters. Many students will nd this activity chal- lenging and may not come up with the relation-ships described in the answer section. They should be rewarded for the accuracy of their reasoning, even if they nd different relationships from those presented below. Many of the analogies described here have been used for years by science teachers. The teacher is encouraged to review them and use or modify those that meet their instructional needs. 10.2.1 Developing analogies in physics: 1 . Angular acceleration is analogous to linear acceleration. Linear acceleration is the rate at which linear veloc-ity changes. This is analogous to angular acceleration, which is the rate at which angular velocity changes. /H9251/H9275 /H11005/H9004 /H9004/H9004 /H9004 tav tis analo s to gou = 2 . A mirror is analogous to a breakwater. The refl ection of a water wave from a fl at breakwater is analogous to the refl ection of light from a mirror. In both instances, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of refl ection. 3 . Optical density is analogous to the shallowness of water. The refraction of light from air (lower optical den-sity) into glass (higher optical density) is analogous to the refraction of water waves from deep to shal-low water. Light travels faster in air than in glass, just as water waves travel faster in deep water than in shallow water (Figure 10.7 ). High optical density is analogous to shallow water and low optical density is analogous to deep water. 4 . Sound waves are analogous to compression waves on a Slinky. Stretch a Slinky spring fl at on the fl oor, and secure both ends. Gather together a set of coils at one end and release them. This creates a compression pulse that travels down the spring and refl ects off the other end. The compression (longitudinal) waves of the Slinky are analogous to sound waves (Figure 10.12 ). Just as the coils are closer together in the compression pulse, so air molecules are closer together in the com-pression portion of a sound wave. Just as the compres-sion wave refl ects at the end of the Slinky, so sound waves echo off a xed surface. 5 . The wave mechanical model of the atom is analogous to a powerboat. As a boat moves, waves are greatest near the boat and decrease in amplitude moving away from the boat. Y ou can locate the most probable loca-tion of the boat by analyzing the amplitude and energy of the waves. This is analogous to the wave mechanical model of the atom, which visualizes the atom as a pos-itive nucleus surrounded by vibrating electron waves. The Shr \u00f6 dinger wave equation describes the amplitude of the waves associated with moving electrons and therefore also describes the relative location of these electrons. c10.indd 200 c10.indd 200 rarefaction compression rarefaction rarefaction spring sound molecules Figure 10.12 Sound/Longitudinal Wave Analogy 6 . The emission of energy from a quasar is analogous to the heat generated at the entrance to a stadium. Quasars release an enormous amount of energy and may be thousands of times brighter than average galaxies. Some astronomers theorize that there are black holes at the centers of quasars. As matter falls into a black hole, it is squeezed and heated by friction with adjacent par-ticles, making it extremely hot so that it gives off light. This is analogous to crowds entering a stadium. Fans get closer together as they funnel through the entrance gate, causing the heat to rise due to the proximity of one to the other and the friction caused by walking and rubbing shoulders as they move toward the gate. 7. Students generate their own analogies. 10.3.1 Developing analogies in chemistry: 1 . Atomic spectra are analogous to ngerprints. Elements and molecules produce unique patterns of spectral lines. These spectra can be used to identify the presence of a particular element or molecule in an unknown substance, just as a ngerprint can be used to identify a unique individual (Figure 10.13 ). 2 . Phases of matter are analogous to stages of a school day. The particles in a solid have a regular arrangement and limited range of movement. This is analogous to a classroom in which students are sitting in chairs. The shifting or turning of students in their seats is analogous to the vibratory motion that takes place in solids. When the bell rings, students fl ow easily from one class to another but are contained by the school-yard fence. This is analogous to a liquid phase in which molecules have limited translational motion that allows them to move among one another and through the halls but are still constrained by the container. At the end of the day, students are free to exit the school and leave the campus. This is analogous to the gas phase in which molecules have unrestricted translational move-ment, allowing for rapid diffusion. 3 . Chemical reactions are analogous to dances. A synthesis reaction is analogous to a couple who gets together to dance. The men and women in the dance are analo-gous to the cations and anions in a solution. A decom-position reaction is similar to the end of a dance, when the couple separates. A double replacement reaction is analogous to two couples who switch partners in the middle of the dance. A single replacement reaction is analogous to a dance in which someone cuts in on a couple and continues to dance with one of them. 4 . Reactions are analogous to factory production. A reac- tion rate is the rate at which a product is produced or a reactant consumed. This is analogous to the rate of car production in an automobile factory. The rate of car production can be measured by the number of cars pro-duced per day or the number of transmissions that are installed. If the factory runs out of transmissions, auto-mobile production comes to a halt. This is analogous to the limiting reagent in a chemical reaction. When a reagent is exhausted, the reaction comes to a standstill. Chemical reactions can be accelerated by catalysts, which assist the reaction but are themselves not changed by it. This is analogous to robotic welders, which accelerate the rate at which cars are assembled but are not them-selves changed by the assembly process. 5 . Collision geometry is analogous to a jigsaw puzzle. Two molecules must collide with the correct collision geom-etry for bonds to form. This is similar to a jigsaw puz-zle in which pieces must be oriented correctly so that pieces will interlock. 6 . The mean free path is analogous to the movement of bumper cars. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions with other mol-ecules. This is similar to riding bumper cars at a carni-val. The more cars in the rink, the shorter the distance, or free path, prior to hitting another car. Smaller cars exhibit longer mean free paths. Similarly, smaller mol-ecules exhibit longer free paths and higher rates of diffusion. 7. Students generate their own analogies. 10.4.1 Developing analogies in biology: 1 . Binomial nomenclature is analogous to human names. Our surname (family name) indicates relatedness, just as a genus name indicates a level of similarity. Our given name differentiates us from other related people, just as a species name differentiates from others in the genus. 2 . Blood vessels are analogous to a road system. Just as a road system is used to deliver food and consumer items while removing waste, so the vascular system is used to deliver food and oxygen while removing excess carbon dioxide and other toxins. Arteries and veins are analo-gous to major freeways, delivering massive amounts or resources quickly. Arterioles and venules connect arter-ies to capillaries, just as highways connect freeways to city streets. Capillaries are used to deliver nutrients and remove waste from individual cells, just as city streets 400 500 600 700spectrum for helium fingerprint of individual Figure 10.13 Atomic Spectrum 5/9/08 5:59:46 PM202 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science are used to deliver goods and remove waste from indi- vidual homes. 3 . The immune system is analogous to a security guard. A security guard at a bank must be able to let in customers while keeping out criminals, just as the immune system must be able to determine self - proteins from non - self proteins. A security guard can be fooled by a false alarm and apprehend innocent citizens. Similarly, the immune system can be fooled by tissue damage or pollen, result-ing in infl ammation or an allergic response. 4 . The eye is analogous to a television camera. Both the eye and a television camera convert light into electri-cal impulses that are viewed and interpreted remotely. The lens of a camera focuses and inverts the image on the charged coupled device or similar device that turns light signals into electrical signals that travel to the monitor for viewing. Similarly, the lens and cornea of the eye focus light and create an inverted image on the retina, which converts the light signal into a nerve impulse, which travels to the brain for interpretation. The diaphragm of the camera opens or closes to regu-late the light into the camera, just as the iris muscles contract or relax to regulate the size of the pupil and the amount of light that enters the eye. The inside of a camera is painted black to prevent the refl ection of light and confusion of the image, just as the inside of the eye is dark to prevent internal refl ection. 5 . Electron transport chains are analogous to balls rolling down staircases. A bowling ball perched at the top of a staircase has potential energy that may be released in a single event if it slips under the banister or in many small events if it rolls down the staircase. Although the amount of energy released is the same regardless of the direction it moves in, it is much easier to manage if it rolls down the staircase. Similarly, electron transport chains release energy in small, manageable portions as electrons are transferred through a series of carriers rather than as bursts of energy that cannot be tapped. 6 . The movement of an action potential along an axon is analogous to the movement of a spectator \" wave \" at a sports stadium. Spectators in a stadium sit until signaled to rise by the rising of their neighbors and return to their seats shortly after their neighbors do the same. Similarly, a portion of an axon maintains a negative polarity until stimulated to reverse by a neighboring portion. In both the stadium and the axon, the reversal is moving and transient. Just as the wave is short - lived at any point in the stadium, so polarity reversal is short - lived. Although a signal is sent in both cases, in neither situation is anything physically transmitted. Because spectators sit immediately after standing, the spectator wave goes only in one direction. Similarly, the refractory period of membrane repolarization ensures that the action poten-tial travels in only one direction. 7. Student responses will vary. 10.5.1 Developing analogies in earth and space science: 1 . The relative dimensions in a cross - section of the Earth are analogous to the relative dimensions in the cross - section of a peach. The proportions of the Earth are similar to the proportions of a peach. The core of the Earth is analogous (in relative size) to the seed, the mantle is analogous to the meat, and the crust is analogous to the skin. 2 . Rocks are analogous to Silly Putty. Silly Putty will shat- ter if hit by a hammer but will slowly mold to a table if allowed to stand. Similarly, rocks break when subjected to intense stresses but slowly bend over geological time if the constant stress of gravity is applied. 3 . The formation of spiral galaxies is analogous to the for- mation of pizza crust from the dough. A pizza chef spins a lump of dough until it is fl attened in a pizza disk. Inertia tends to pull the lump of dough into a disc, and electrostatic attraction within the dough holds it together. Similarly, inertial forces may tend to pull a spinning galaxy into a disc, while gravitational attrac-tion holds it together. 4 . Pulsars are analogous to lights on emergency vehicles. Pulsars emit energy, but not equally in all directions. Strong magnetic elds concentrate the energy in two opposite directions. Pulsars spin like the emergency light on a police car or ambulance. Distant observers see pulses of energy at regular intervals. 5 . Space - time is analogous to a trampoline. Space - time involves four dimensions, so any three - dimensional analogy is limited. The space - time continuum is analo-gous to the surface of a trampoline on which a number of people are standing. The gravitational attraction on each person warps the trampoline in the area sur-rounding their feet. If all but one of the people con-verge at one point on the trampoline, its surface will become dramatically warped. Balls (analogous to light or other radiation) can still be rolled from the remain-ing individual to the group, but balls rolled from the group to the individual are less likely to succeed due to the curvature of the trampoline (space - time). If many people gather at the center, the trampoline bends so that the group is surrounded by it, at which point balls (representing light) cannot exit. A black hole is thought to warp space - time completely around itself, like the group of people at the same point on the tram-poline. If space - time is warped suf ciently, no light will escape, hence the term black hole. 6 . The expanding universe is analogous to a rising loaf of raisin bread. In the 1920s, Edwin Hubble made the dis- covery that all distant galaxies are moving away from us. This is analogous to baking a loaf of raisin bread in which the raisins represent galaxies. As the loaf rises, the raisins in the loaf move farther from each other. Similarly, as the universe expands, galaxies are always moving farther from each other. 7. Students develop their own analogies. c10.indd 202 c10.indd 202 5/9/08 5:59:47 PM 5/9/08 5:59:47 PM203Chapter Eleven Tools for Improving Memory in Science For the Teacher 203 11.1 The Primacy and Recency Effect 211 11.2 Expanding Short - Term Memory by Chunking 211 11.3 Science Acronyms and Abbreviations 215 11.4 Acrostics for Memorizing Lists 216 Answers to Chapter Activities 219 For the Teacher \" Is the primary goal of science instruction to encourage the development of higher order - reasoning, or to ensure mastery of speci c science content? \" This question is frequently debated by curriculum specialists and science educators and has led to periodic shifts in curricular plans in schools and districts throughout the country. I believe that this oscillating and schizophrenic approach to curriculum planning can be elimi-nated if educators agree that the development of reasoning skills and mastery of science content are complementary rather than competing objectives. Students with a solid understanding of basic facts are better able to engage in higher - order reason-ing, and students who can reason well are better able to memorize and recall basic information. This chapter emphasizes strategies and tech- niques for memorizing science principles and facts, with the understanding that such memory is foun-dational to the development of higher - order rea-soning skills. T o better understand how to improve memory, it is helpful to understand the basics of cognitive science, the study of the acquisition and use of knowledge. Cognitive scientists describe three basic types of memory: sensory, short term, and long term. Sensory memory is immediate perceptual memory and lasts only 1 second or less. When we attend to stimuli, items acquired in sensory memory can be stored in short - term memory, where they either forgotten or maintained by rehearsal. From short - term memory, information is encoded into long - term memory by more elaborative rehearsal and encoding. During retrieval, information passes from long - term memory back into short - term memory, where we become conscious of it and can use it in solving problems. Sensory memory has a large capacity but is very short - lived. We perceive images, sounds, and other sensory input for a brief moment, but this information is quickly lost if not encoded in short - term memory. By contrast, short - term memory has a very small capacity of seven (plus or minus two) chunks of information but can hold that information for up to half a minute or more. Short - term memory stores information for a brief c11.indd 203 c11.indd 203 5/9/08 6:02:04 PM 5/9/08 6:02:04 PM204 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science processing but are lost when a computer is turned off unless the information has rst been encoded in secondary memory (storage memory, in forms such as DVD, CD, or magnetic disc). Human working memory (also known as short - term memory) is analogous to the primary memory of the microcomputer. We load infor-mation from long - term memory or from sen-sory memory into short - term memory before we perform operations with it in our mind, just as a computer loads data from a secondary storage media or input devices into RAM before perform-ing operations. When we stop concentrating, data in our work- ing memory are lost unless we have rst stored this information in long - term memory. In a simi-lar manner, abruptly turning off the power to a computer causes all data in RAM to be lost unless it has rst been saved to secondary memory. Distraction and interference can cause a loss from human short - term memory, just as power surges and electrical failure can cause a loss of infor-mation in the primary memory of a computer. period in preparation for encoding into long - term memory. During the 30 seconds or less that an item is stored in short - term memory, it may be maintained through rehearsal. For example, a sci-ence student may say an equation repeatedly to maintain it in short - term memory until it can be stored in long - term memory. There is no known limit to the capacity of long - term memory, and long - term memory may store items inde nitely when encoded with appropriate organization and meaning. A summary of the basic facts of human memory is illustrated in Figure 11.1 and summa-rized in Table 11.1 . Although the brain is exceedingly more com- plex than any manufactured computer, an analogy between a personal computer and the human mind may help explain certain aspects of human memory. In a personal computer, the central processing unit conducts the logical and mathematical operations. The computer has primary memory (working mem-ory, also known as random access memory, RAM), which stores data for immediate use by the micro-processor. Data in primary memory are available for Table 11.1 Forms and Stages of Memory Sensory Memory Short-Term Memory Long-Term Memory Capacity very large 7 (/H110062) chunks of data no known limit Maximum duration 1 second 30 seconds permanent Method of maintenance not possible maintenance rehearsal elaborative rehearsal and organization Method of retrieval perception serial, exhaustive search search with retrieval cues Chief cause of forgetting decay interference and decay interference Major information code sensory acoustic semantic, meaning SM sensory memorySTM short-term memoryLTM long-term memoryinformation retrieval sight, sound, touch, etc. output maintenance rehearsalattention to stimulielaborative rehearsal Figure 11.1 Memory Theory 204 5/9/08 6:02:05 PM 5/9/08 6:02:05 PMTools for Improving Memory in Science 205 Information that is stored in human long - term memory is relatively permanent but can be lost through physical trauma or chemical interac-tions, just as data on storage media may be lost by demagnetization, heat, or physical damage. Just as individuals encode information in different ways, so different computer operating systems encode les in different manners. If the operating system of a computer fails to store le information accurately in the directory, the user may lose access to the les. Similarly, unless we properly encode our memories in elaborate and effective ways, we may lose access to them. Just as the les remain in the secondary memory of the com- puter and yet inaccessible due to a lack of appropri-ate directory information, so memory traces may remain inaccessible in our brain due to an inability to nd an appropriate path to them. As the number of les in a computer grows, indexing and cross - referencing become more critical. Similarly, as we present students with more information, it becomes increasingly important to help them index this information in a manner that will facilitate retrieval. Nowhere is the knowledge explosion more dramatic than in the sciences, and educators should help stu-dents develop the logic necessary to encode and cross - reference data for easy retrieval. Cognitive psychologists refer to working mem- ory as short - term memory since it is ephemeral in nature. Traditionally the extent of short - term memory is measured by digit span: the number of random digits an individual can keep in short - term memory. Research indicates that most people have digit spans of ve to nine and are unable to increase this span signi cantly. Although we may be unable to expand short - term memory, we can learn to use it more ef ciently through techniques such as primary rehearsal and chunking, which we discuss in this section. Long - term memory is more fl exible than short - term memory, and there is a substantial amount of research on techniques to improve it, including multiple modalities, semantic depth, acrostics, acronyms, transfer appropriateness, unan ticipated events, context effects, nonverbal memory, and retrieval practice. The student activi-ties following the discussion of these memory techniques use these techniques to help build memory of science facts and concepts. Memory Technique 1: Maintenance Rehearsal The brain ' s cerebral cortex (center of short - term memory) receives messages from the eyes, ears, and touch sensors. It is necessary to pay atten-tion to such stimuli for a few seconds to provide suf cient time for such information to be encoded into short - term memory. Interference at this stage can displace newly acquired information from the consciousness. T eachers should make certain their lectures and discussions have suf cient wait times to allow students to encode new information into short - term memory. Primary rehearsal (a conscious mental reitera- tion of information), also known as maintenance rehearsal or rote cycling, maintains a memory trace in short - term memory. Primary rehearsal is useful when one must apply the knowledge imme-diately, as when remembering information from a lecture while writing it in one ' s notes. Research shows that one mechanism of primary rehearsal is an articulatory loop (one that involves speaking). Electromyographic studies have detected action potentials in the sublabial muscles (those below the lip) when subjects were asked to silently mem-orize random digit sequences, indicating that the subjects were subvocalizing the sequences in an effort to keep the memory traces alive in short - term memory. 1 Since a memory must be kept alive in short - term memory before it can be encoded into long - term memory, it is to our advantage to capitalize on the articulatory loop . Science teach- ers may ask students to repeatedly vocalize impor-tant information to be remembered. For example, if you are introducing the Ideal Gas Law, have your class chant \" PV /H11005 nRT \" periodically throughout the class. Memory is improved by pronouncing the names of the items out loud, especially if they are grouped rhythmically. Grouping items into threes or fours also seems to aid recall. The repetition of important terms, phrases, and equations will keep them in short - term memory until they can be trans-ferred to long - term memory. c11.indd 205 6:02:06 PM 5/9/08 6:02:06 Sourcebook for Teaching Science Memory Technique 2: Chunking If short - term memory storage is limited to seven (plus or minus two) items, one might wonder how complex situations can be memorized quickly. Blind chess players, for example, must keep the positions of 32 pieces on a chessboard in working memory. Expert players overcome this problem by chunking information in recognizable units. For example, knowing that your opponent has a king ' s side castle defense requires only one \" digit \" of your memory span yet identi es the position of four or more pieces. Figure 11.2A shows a random setup for a chess- board. If this diagram is shown briefl y to both novice and expert players, neither will be able to remember the entire setup because it is far too com-plex to quickly memorize. By contrast, Figure 11.2B shows a standard opening that an expert will recog-nize and remember, while the novice will be unable to. The expert may recognize the entire opening as one or more chunks of information, while the nov-ice simply sees a series of individual pieces. Novices can ' t memorize complex chess positions because they don ' t have relevant chunks of data in their long - term memory to draw upon. T o show the value of the chunking strategy, write the following sequence of letters on the board; after 30 seconds, cover it up and ask stu-dents to write it from memory: pneumonoultramicroscopicsilico volcanoconiosis Those who do not chunk the sequence will remember nine or fewer letters, but those who recognize chunks of information will be able to recall signi cantly more. This sequence of letters is the longest word in the English language and can be chunked into the following pre xes, roots, and suf xes: the pre x pneumo - means lung. Next, are ultra - , meaning extreme, micro - mean- ing small, and scopic - meaning to view. These are followed by silico - , which refers to silicon, and volcano - , which refers to the mineral particles that make up a volcano. Next there is coni - , a deriva- tive of the Greek word konis meaning dust, and the suf x - osis, which refers to a condition. Thus, this word, referring to a disease of the lungs caused by extremely small particles of ash and dust, is made of eight chunks of information (Figure 11.3 ) and may be kept in short - term memory. Some peo-ple might use larger chunks (perhaps ultramicro- scopic ) and thereby use less of their memory span. Once this term has been committed to long - term memory, it consumes only a single chunk in the short - term memory span. Activity 11.2 presents some chunking exercises designed to help students develop this important memory skill. Short - term memory has signi cant acoustic and articulatory components. In other words, people keep things in short - term memory best if they hear (acoustic) and speak (articulation) them. Thus, when you want students to keep information in short - term memory so they may be processed for long - term memory, it is helpful to say the items and have stu-dents repeat them out loud, or say them silently to themselves so they can hear them in their minds. Memory Technique 3: Multiple Modalities The human mind is capable of storing images in short - term memory, but research suggests that this imagery system is based on spatial orientation AB Figure 11.2 (A) Random and (B) Nonrandom Arrangements on a Chess Boardpneumo micro silico coniultra scopic osis lung silico volcano coni osis scopic Figure 11.3 Chunking by Roots, Pre xes, and Suf xes c11.indd 206 c11.indd 206 5/9/08 6:02:06 PM 5/9/08 6:02:06 PMTools for Improving Memory in Science 207 as well as visual information. As a result, students develop better short - term memory traces of images through kinesthetic and visual experiences than purely visual experiences. Thus, when a student handles a rock specimen or titrates a solution, the image trace is much richer than when he or she simply looks at the rock or watches the instructor perform a titration. Given that the primary trace is stronger, there is greater likelihood that the experi-ence will be encoded into long term memory. An old proverb says, \" T ell me and I will for- get; show me and I may remember; involve me and I will understand. \" This proverb describes a basic pedagogical principle: teachers should present material in multiple modalities (auditory, visual, and kinesthetic) to provide optimal conditions for encoding into memory. Laboratory activities are generally a good way to involve all three modali-ties, but many concepts are not practically intro-duced with a laboratory experience, and with these concepts, the teacher needs to be particularly crea-tive. For example, most students are introduced to the bones of the wrist and hand by showing them a chart or diagram. An introduction to such mate-rial can be enhanced if the student is asked to use one hand to palpate and draw the apparent bone structure of the other. This kinesthetic and visual experience can then be augmented auditorily and visually as the teacher explains the structure of the hand using a diagram. The activities throughout involve multiple learning modalities. Y ou should always be thinking of ways to present your lessons that require the use of vision, hearing, and touch. Memory Technique 4: Semantic Depth Research indicates that individuals can develop their long - term recall and recognition signi cantly by using deeper encoding mechanisms when learning new material. 2 Cognitive scientists iden- tify the depth of encoding as the degree of seman-tic involvement. The more meaning (semantic depth) attributed to an item during the encoding process, the better the memory trace is. Research-ers describe four levels of encoding. These levels, in order of increasing depth, are (1) structural (the actual sequence of letters and shape of the word), (2) phonemic (the sounds generated when the word is pronounced), (3) categorical (the rela- tionship of the word to known taxonomies), and (4) sentence (the contextual relationship of the word in language usage). When study time and method of testing are kept constant, subjects who are asked deeper - level (semantic) questions while learning vocabulary words perform signi cantly better on subsequent recall and recognition tests than those asked less semantically deep questions. Thus, if you want your students be able to recall and recognize information at a later date, you will be wise to employ techniques that require deeper - level processing. For example, if you are giving a vocabulary list that includes new terms, it is more advantageous to ask students to create new sen-tences that demonstrate their understanding of the meaning of these words rather than simply having them transcribe glossary de nitions. When students are asked to create meaningful sentences using new vocabulary words, they must analyze semantic relationships and integrate new words into appropriate context, and this deeper encod-ing promotes subsequent recall. This is commonly known as the generation effect. Given that it is bene cial for students to gen- erate semantically rich sentences from new vocab-ulary words, it is logical to assume that they will also bene t by discovering the meanings of the roots from which scienti c words are composed. Fortunately, nearly all scienti c terms are derived from meaningful Latin and Greek root words, pro-viding a rich semantic environment in which to learn vocabulary. Students should be challenged to analyze the meanings of the roots of every new vocabulary word in an effort to establish a root word vocabulary list (see Chapter One ) from which they can discover new words. For example, you might ask your students to generate a name for the shallow muscle that \" bends the ngers. \" Looking at the root word lists, the student may see such associations as fl ex - bend, digit - nger, and super - cial - surface, and derive or identify the term: fl exor digitorum super cialis. T o avoid misleading conclu- sions and confusing detours, initially guide the class through a collective discovery exercise. Once stu-dents correctly associate a concept with a term, they will have a richer understanding of the word and c11.indd 207 c11.indd 207 5/9/08 6:02:07 PM 5/9/08 6:02:07 PM208 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science see how it relates to other concepts. For example, fl exor digitorum super cialis is semantically related to \" fl exing muscles \" (both involve bending a joint), the \" digital system \" (both our number system and the hands have ten digits), and \" super cial arguments \" (a super cial muscle is located near the surface, while a super cial argument is a shallow one). After you lead the class through the process of discovering terms from logical root words, have them employ these terms in meaningful new sen-tences to bene t from the generation effect. In conclusion, to develop long - term recall and recognition of terms, concepts, or processes, strive to present new material in a semantically deep manner, and create study activities that require students to learn in a manner that stresses meanings and rela-tionships. Such an approach to teaching and learn-ing may require more time initially but will lead to a better understanding and a longer memory. Memory Technique 5: Acronyms Memory technique 4 stresses the importance of semantic depth in the memory and recall of new concepts, terms, and processes. One way in which to apply this principle is to explain the meaning of acronyms when introducing them in the curricu-lum. An acronym is a word or collection of letters formed by the rst letters of words of a particular concept, organization, or principle. For example, the term scuba is an acronym for \" s elf - c ontained u nderwater b reathing a pparatus. \" Most people simply memorize the term without understand-ing its origins, and therefore do not bene t from the semantics inherent in the term. We suggest that you explain the meanings of acronyms when introducing them. Students will not only bene t from a deeper understanding of what the acro-nyms represent, but will be much more likely to remember them long term. Activity 11.3 can be used in the classroom to help students understand the value of acronyms. Memory Technique 6: Acrostics There are many situations in which science students must memorize lists of information. An acrostic is a memory strategy for memorizing ordered and nonordered lists for which there is no appar-ent organization in the items themselves. Unlike acronyms, which take the rst letters of words in a series or phrase to form a single summarizing word (the acronym), acrostics take the rst letters of a series of words to form a memorable phrase (the acrostic). By memorizing the acrostic, students may be better able to recall the list of items the phrase represents. For example, students may become frustrated memorizing the major elements neces-sary for human life because there is no apparent reason that some are necessary and others are not. They may see no a priori reason that the list should contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, potassium, iodine, nitrogen, sulfur, calcium, iron, magnesium, sodium, and chlorine but exclude boron, silicon, and lithium. T o simplify the memo-rization of the this list, introduce an acrostic using the elemental symbols for the items in the list: C. HOPKINS CaFe Mg NaCl C pronounced \" C. Hopkins Caf \u00e9 , \" Mighty Good, needs NaCl (salt), \" is easy to mem-orize if said out loud to the class. Once memorized, the acrostic helps the student remember the items it represents. For example, when asked if phospho-rous is an essential element, a student can imme-diately say yes because of the \" P \" in the acrostic. Activity 11.3 will help students learn to employ acrostics when memorizing lists for science class. Memory Technique 7: Transfer Appropriateness Memory research shows that items are easier to recall if the cues at the time of retrieval match those at the time of encoding. This principle, referred to as transfer appropriateness, may be help- ful for a speci c memory task. For example, if you need to recall some childhood memory, it is advan-tageous to return to your childhood home where that memory was encoded. In a similar although less dramatic, manner, science students may bene t c11.indd 208 c11.indd 208 5/9/08 6:02:08 PMTools for Improving Memory in Science 209 by studying for a science test in the same room in which they will be examined, because the environ-ment at the time of retrieval will match the envi-ronment at the time of encoding. In real life, however, retrieval cues generally don ' t match encoding cues. Students may do well on an assessment of memory but be unable to trans-fer the concepts they have learned to novel envi-ronments or situations. Thus, although memory experts suggest matching encoding and retrieval cues to promote recall, I believe that efforts to do so may simply be teaching to the test and give students a false sense of accomplishment. Nevertheless, an understanding of the principle of transfer appropri-ateness may help science teachers see how and why some recall problems develop and suggest ways to address such problems. The principle of transfer appropriateness is clearly seen in the application of algebraic principles to chemistry. Introductory chemistry uses many algebraic principles, yet students often have dif - culty applying these previously learned concepts to chemistry. For example, students will gen erally have no dif culty solving for b in the equation ab /H11005 cde, while being unable to solve for wavelength ( /H9261 ) in the equation /H9258 ). Although the algebra in both situations is similar, the cues are different. The rst uses variable names frequently seen in an algebra class; the second equation does not. Fortunately, most recent mathematics text- books include problems that employ variable sym-bols commonly used in chemistry and physics. Science teachers are advised to encourage their colleagues in the math department to use such problems so that students will be better able to transfer math skills to science. Similarly, science teachers should stress the interrelationships of sci-ence to other elds of study so that students use the concepts they learned in science in other elds. Later we discuss the importance of transfer appro-priateness when teaching science classes. Memory Technique 8: Discrepant Scenes and Events Research by cognitive scientists indicates that when initial visual processing is relatively easy, effortless, and \" automatic, \" subsequent memory for an event is typically poor, but when processing is dif cult, extensive, or elaborate, retention is relatively high. 3 For example, people remember unexpected visual images better than common visual images because they require a greater degree of analysis and invoke more semantic processing. Advertisers frequently use this principle when promoting a product. For example, an advertiser may hide the company logo of the product in a relatively abstract scene. The viewer, by struggling to determine the meaning of the scene, discovers the logo and remembers it well. Science teachers can also employ discrepant scenes and events to promote memory of impor-tant principles. For example, students expect wood to fl oat and rocks to sink when placed in water. When a piece of ebony wood is placed in a con-tainer of water, students are surprised to see it sink, and when a chunk of pumice rock is placed in the same container, they are surprised to see it fl oat. The discrepant visual images of sinking wood and fl oating rock can help students remem- ber Archimedes ' principle, which describes the conditions under which a substance will sink or fl oat. Science teachers should employ many dis- crepant events because they trigger more elabo-rate processing and better memory. (For examples of discrepant events, see Chapter Five , as well as Hands - On Chemistry Activities with Real - Life Applications and Hands - On Physics Activities with Real - Life Applications. ) 4 Memory Principle 9: Integration of Visual and Verbal Information Cognitive science suggests that humans have a dual memory system, with some memories stored in a spatial - visual system and others in a temporal - verbal system. Since item - for - item storage capacity is greater for pictorial than verbal material and since individuals can use learned equivalences to transfer between visual images and verbal concepts, science educators should employ spatial - visual materials to improve memory of both visual and verbal information. some educators do not recog- nize the signi cance of linking visual and verbal information, as refl ected in purely verbal lectures or curricula that separate form from function. For example, many colleges teach anatomy and physi-ology as two separate classes, causing a dichotomy between the spatial - visual rich information of anatomy and the temporal - verbal rich material of physiology. When students learn function in the context of form, they develop meaningful relationships between the two, thereby improving understanding and memory. Form and function should be taught in a uni ed manner to help forge important connections between data in spatial - visual and temporal - verbal memory systems. Although science educators are not able to illustrate all concepts in graphic form, they should strive to do so whenever possible. Even if it is not feasible to draw a picture or a diagram, a teacher can explain material in a way that helps students generate images in their minds. For example, rather than simply stating that biceps brachii is a muscle of the upper arm, you should explain that the term itself can be used to generate a mental picture of the muscle. Since bi means \" two, \" cep means \" head, \" and brachii refers to the upper arm, the biceps brachii must be a two - headed muscle of the upper arm. Students can picture this in their mind and imme-diately distinguish it from the triceps brachii (three - headed muscle of the upper arm) or the biceps femoris (two - headed muscle of the upper leg). Although no physical picture has been drawn, the description of the muscles based on the meanings of their roots is suf cient for students to draw a pic- ture in their mind, thereby linking the spatial - visual information with the temporal - verbal knowledge and improving understanding and memory. Memory Principle 10: Retrieval Practice Memory researcher Robert Bjork stated, \" The typ- ical college student spends too much time reading and underlining and far too little time summa-rizing, paraphrasing, and testing his or her abil-ity to retrieve what has been studied. \" 5 Professors, teachers, and students tend to spend much more time and energy on the process of inputting and encoding information than on the retrieval and outputting of this information. This imbalance is unfortunate, particularly since all of testing instru-ments directly assess the ability to retrieve and output rather than the ability to input and encode. Although effective input and encoding are essen-tial for a strong memory, they must be coupled with effective retrieval and output. As educators, we should encourage retrieval practice (the outputting of information stored in long - term memory) in ways that resemble the exam on which a student is assessed. Students should learn to quiz themselves and each other, simulating test-ing situations as closely as possible. When individu-als learn to practice output or retrieval techniques, they generally see a marked improvement in their test scores. But few students study in such output - oriented modes, spending the vast majority of their study time passively reading the book, reviewing their notes, and listening to recordings of the lecture. As science educators, one of the ways we can encourage an output - oriented approach to learn-ing is by modeling such an approach in the class-room. The Socratic method of instruction is one such approach that is effective in encouraging student output and participation. The instruc-tor asks leading questions of the class to guide the students in review and discovery. Students in such classes eventually learn to ask questions of them-selves in a similar manner and thus become self - monitoring, output - oriented learners. In addition, the instructor can use various team games (see Chapter Thirteen ) to encourage retrieval practice in preparation for exams. Rather than offering tra-ditional review sessions in which the teacher once again presents material and students try to input it, it is more effective to employ games that will motivate students to practice retrieving and out-putting what they have already learned. Through-out this book are activities that can be used to encourage the retrieval and output of information just learned, thereby building student memory. I encourage you to monitor your own teaching to ensure that you model output - oriented learning while providing ample opportunities for student retrieval and output practice. c11.indd 210 c11.indd 210 5/9/08 6:02:09 PM 5/9/08 6:02:09 PMTools for Improving Memory in Science 211 11.1 The Primacy and Recency Effect Short - term memory is brief in duration (approxi- mately 30 seconds or less) and small in capac-ity ( ve to nine items), while long - term memory may last inde nitely and has unknown capacity. Memory researchers believe that memories must rst be formed in short - term memory before they can form in long - term memory. The experiment in Activity 11.1.1 tests the concepts of primacy and recency as students analyze the ability of people to recall a series of unrelated terms. Primacy refers to the idea that the rst items presented will be remembered better than later items because data have more time in which to move from short - term to long - term memory. Recency refers to the idea that items presented most recently should remain in short - term memory better than ones presented earlier because of the temporal nature of short - term memory. Thus, one might predict that when given a long list of items to remember, a student may remember well the rst ( primacy effect) and last items ( recency effect) but not the ones in the middle. T o test this hypothesis, conduct this mem-ory experiment with ve or more of your fellow students. ACTIVITY 11.1.1 Memory Experiment T ell the participants that you will read a list of 20 words at a rate of 1 per second: (1) energy (11) momentum (2) volcano (12) cell (3) experiment (13) whale (4) photosynthesis (14) comet (5) gravity (15) combustion (6) fault (16) microscope (7) force (17) fungus(8) mitosis (18) radiation (9) eclipse (19) geyser (10) carbon (20) titanium At the end of the time, they are to write down as many words as they can recall. On graph paper, place 20 marks on the x - axis, numbered from 1 to 20, to indicate the number of each word presented in sequence. The y - axis should be labeled to indicate the percentage of the participants that recalled each term. Thus, if four out of ve peo- ple recalled the rst term, you would indicate that 80 percent of the people recalled the rst term. Plot the results of your experiment. Do your data sup-port the primacy (early terms have been encoded into long - term memory) and recency (latest items are still in short - term memory) hypotheses? What other factors may explain why some terms are remembered better than others? 11.2 Expanding Short - Term Memory by Chunking Cognitive scientists have determined that human short - term memory can hold ve to nine items simultaneously. In other words, most people can remember between this number of unrelated pieces of information in short - term memory but are una-ble to hold longer sequences. For example, you can probably look at a phone book and remember the seven - digit telephone number of your insurance company long enough to make a call, but cannot glance at your family ' s seventeen - digit vehicle iden-ti cation number (a unique number that identi es each vehicle) and give it to your insurance repre-sentative without rst writing it down or commit- ting it to long - term memory. Although cognitive scientists say that our short - term memory has a digit span of seven plus or minus two, some people are known to be able to keep long lists of information in short - term memory. Although they appear to have extraor-dinary short - term memory, their talent is not due to some physiological or psychological superior-ity but rather to their trained ability to organize large amounts of information into a short number of recognizable \" chunks. \" Chunking is the process of breaking down a complex sequence or concept into nine or fewer independently recognizable units that can all be stored simultaneously in short - term memory. For example, people cannot place the sequence 18005551212 into short - term memory c11.indd 211 6:02:09 PM 5/9/08 6:02:09 Sourcebook for Teaching Science unless they have chunked the data into a smaller number of recognizable units. An astute individual may see that this resembles a telephone number that can be represented as four meaningful chunks 1 - 800 - 555 - 1212 (international dialing code \u2014 area code \u2014 pre x \u2014 number). Radio announcers know the importance of chunking, and they break down telephone numbers into recognizable units as they are spoken, making it easier for listeners to remem-ber the numbers. For example, a radio announcer would say that the telephone number starts with \" 1 - 800, \" a recognizable pre x for U.S. toll - free long distance. Thus, the rst four digits are represented as just one chunk in the memory span. The two most important factors in encoding information into short - term memory are meaning- fulness (informational value) and chunking (com- bining stimuli to reduce memory load). T o improve short - term memory, it is vital to look for meaning and chunk data into logical subsets when ever pos-sible. Increasing short - term memory is an impor-tant step to increasing long - term memory, because information must pass through short - term mem-ory before it can be stored as a long - term memory. I already noted that it is not possible to keep the seventeen - character sequence of a vehicle iden-ti cation number (VIN) in short - term memory, yet auto insurance adjusters (people who estimate the cost of repairing damaged vehicles) seem to do so with little effort. Although the sequence of num-bers (generally found on the dashboard next to the windshield and on the engine block and other parts) appears random and meaningless to most people, it is packed with information to those who understand the code. Each character represents something about the car. The rst character identi- es the country where it was assembled, the second the company that manufactured it, and so on. Thus, a VIN that starts with the number 1G belongs to a vehicle made in America (1 /H11005 USA) by General Motors (G /H11005 General Motors), whereas a VIN that starts with JT belongs to a vehicle made in Japan (J /H11005 Japan) by T oyota (T /H11005 T oyota). The rest of the characters in the VIN identify such things as engine size, model year, and color of paint, making it easy for the adjuster to match a VIN with a car. T o an insurance adjuster, a sequence such as 1G or JT is simply one meaningful chunk of information and takes up only one space in short - term memory. Nothing enters long - term memory with- out rst passing through short - term memory, so to improve long - term memory, it is essential to improve the capacity of short - term memory. T o increase your short - term memory capacity, it is necessary to chunk information into meaningful and recognizable units. Memorizing new vocabulary terms for a sci- ence class can prove to be a daunting task because many terms are lengthy and have unusual sounds. Fortunately, most scienti c terms are very descrip- tive once you understand the roots, pre xes, and suf xes. Each of these components is a meaning- ful chunk that can be used to hold the terms in short - term memory until they can be committed to long - term memory. Knowledge of root words (see Chapter One ) is extremely useful in chunking terms. For example, the term sternocleidomastoid is a dif cult term to memorize unless it is chunked as sterno - (related to the sternum), cleido (related to the clavicle), and mastoid (related to the mas- toid process of the temporal bone.) The term sterno - cleido - mastoid can be held in short - term memory with just three chunks of information. The fact that these chunks are meaningful helps us eventually condense this into one chunk of infor-mation as \" the muscle that joins the sternum and clavicle with the side of the head. \" Activities 11.2.1 to 11.2.4 present a vari- ety of lengthy and probably unfamiliar scienti c terms. Students will chunk each term into mean-ingful roots, pre xes, and suf xes using the roots provided in Chapter One or online (go to sciencesourcebook.com or search \" dictionary \" ). They will specify the meanings of each chunk (root) and then provide the de nition of the entire term. ACTIVITY 11.2.1 Chunking New Vocabulary: Biology Break the following muscle names into mean-ingful chunks as illustrated in the rst example. De ne each term on the basis of its roots (see the root world list in section 1.1). After identify ing the chunks and their meanings, attempt to identify c11.indd 212 c11.indd 212 5/9/08 6:02:10 PM 5/9/08 6:02:10 PMTools for Improving Memory in Science 213 the location of each on Figure 11.4 without referring to your book or other diagrams.

Chunking in phonemes: Write the follow- ing sequence on a blank sheet of paper and show it to your partner for 3 seconds before removing it. Ask your partner to write down everything he or she can remember. u e i g l r t d r c o n Repeat the same exercise with the following sequence: c o u r t r e d l i n g On which task did your partner perform bet- ter? Why? Both are meaningless sequences, but the second is easier to remember because it is arranged in one pronounceable (although nonsensical) chunk rather than 12 unrelated chunks as the rst sequence. Examine data from the rest of the class to see if this phenomenon is generalizable. b . Chunking in logical units: Write the follow- ing sequence on a blank sheet of paper, and show it to your partner for 3 seconds before removing it and asking your partner to write down everything he or she can remember: 1492177618651969 Repeat the same exercise with the following sequence: 1492 1776 1865 1969 On which task did your partner perform better? Why? Both represent the same sequence, but the second has been broken into four chunks, each of which may represent just one item in the memory span, particularly if your partner rec-ognizes these sequences as signi cant dates in American history (1492, Columbus landed in the New World; 1776, the colonies declared their inde-pendence from Britain; 1865, the American Civil War ended; 1969, the United States landed a man on the Moon). Instead of memorizing 16 unre-lated pieces of information, your partner needed to remember only four meaningful dates. c . Series and chunking : Write the following sequence on a blank sheet of paper and show it to your partner for 5 seconds before removing it and asking your partner to write down everything he or she can remember: G8E7A1F10C19DB56 Next, repeat the same exercise with the follow- ing sequence: 5A6B7C8D9E10F11G On which task did your partner perform bet- ter? Why? Both series contain the same characters, but the second is arranged in a manner that can be memorized as a single chunk: the numbers 5 to 11 interspersed with letters from A to G. d . Organization and chunking: Show Figure 11.5 to your partner for 3 seconds before removing it. Then ask your partner to sketch what he or she saw. Repeat the same exercise with Figure 11.6 . On which task did your partner perform better? Why? Although both contain the same gures, the sec- ond is much easier to remember because it is dis-played in a way that promotes chunking. This activity illustrates the importance of organization in the process of chunking for c11.indd 214 c11.indd 214 5/9/08 6:02:11 PM 5/9/08 6:02:11 PMTools for Improving Memory in Science 215 short - term memory. Whether you organize data when problem solving or your equipment when conducting a laboratory experiment, you will nd a dramatic improvement in your ability to chunk larger amounts of information if the data has been preorganized. 11.3 Science Acronyms and Abbreviations An acronym is a word or collection of letters formed by the rst letters of words of a particular term. For example, NASA stands for N ational A eronau- tics and S pace A dministration. An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase. For example, smog is an abbreviation for \" sm oke and f og . \" Acro- nyms or abbreviations help save time and energy when explaining concepts, but they are meaning-less to those unfamiliar with their origin. Most students of biology know that DNA is a substance that carries the genetic code, yet do not understand why it is called DNA, or what the name says about the substance. Some one who knows that DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid can rea- sonably infer that DNA is found in the nucleus (deoxyri bonucleic acid), is acidic in nature sugar ribose ( ribo nucleic acid), and differs from RNA (ribo- nucleic acid) by lacking oxygen on one of the carbons in the ribose ( deoxy ribonucleic acid). Some acro- nyms become used so frequently that they become accepted words in the English language. For example, laser (note that it is in lowercase letters because it has become accepted as a standard word) is an acronym for l ight a mpli cation by s timulated e mission of r adiation. In a laser, light ( l aser) is ampli ed (l a ser) as atoms emit (las e r) visible radiation (lase r ) when atoms in the laser crystal are stimulated (la s er) by an external power source. Understanding the origin of acronyms and abbreviations helps in understanding and remembering what they represent. I encourage you to always investigate the origin of scienti c acronyms (refer to sciencesourcebook. com or search \" acronym dictionary \" ) and abbre- viations, and determine what can be known from the terms they represent. ACTIVITY 11.3.1 Biology Acronyms and Abbreviations Using traditional dictionaries, online acro-nym databases, or other resources, identify the original terms represented by each of the fol-lowing acronyms or abbreviations, and explain what can be learned about each.

Unlike acronyms, which take the rst letters of words in a series to form a word, acrostics take the rst letters of a series of words to form a memorable phrase. For example, the ordered list of classi cation terms in biology ( k ingdom, o rder, f amily, g enus, s pecies) can be represented by the acrostic K ing P hilip c ame o ver f or g reat s paghetti. Because the acrostic must be said in one order and make sense, it helps students remember the correct sequence. Note that in the example, Kingdom precedes phylum in classi cation, just as King precedes Philip in the acrostic. In the activities that follow, you will see a series of acrostics for many ordered and nonordered lists of information in science. Select one acrostic for each, and use it to memorize the series or list. ACTIVITY 11.4.1 Using Acrostics to Memo rize Lists in Biology The rst group of words contains the list of sci- enti c information. It is followed by one or more acrostics.

Select one of the lists in Activities 11.4.1 to 11.4.3, and make your own acrostic. Answers to Chapter Activities 11.1.1 Students will probably, but not always, con rm the recency and primacy effects. It is suggested that they analyze the class data by plotting the information with a spreadsheet program. Students may wish to make their own word or object lists. 11.2.1 Biology terms (muscles).

By contrast, physiology is the study of the functions of these organisms and their component parts. In many schools and colleges, anatomy and physi-ology are taught as separate subjects, so students learn structure apart from function or function apart from structure. Although it may be conven-ient to teach anatomy and physiology as separate disciplines, it is not wise to do so. The structures of organisms and their component systems, organs, tissues, cells, organelles, and molecules are directly related to their physiological functions. For example, the structure of red blood cells is best understood in the light of their function, and vice versa. Red blood cells (erythrocytes) carry oxygen from the lungs to body tissues and carbon dioxide from body tissues to the lungs. The relationship between structure and function in red blood cells is illustrated as follows. 1. Red blood cells must travel through tiny capil- laries ( function ) to exchange oxygen with sur- rounding tissues and must therefore be small, smooth, and fl exible ( structure ). Figure 12.1A is a scanning electron micrograph illustrating their small, smooth shape, and it is easy to imagine how they fl ex when traveling through capillaries. 2. Red blood cells exchange gases ( function ) with surrounding tissues by diffusion. Oxygen dif-fuses to body tissues, while carbon dioxide diffuses from these tissues to the red blood cells. The rate of diffusion is related to the ratio of surface area to volume of the cells. Note that the unique biconcave shape ( struc- ture ) of red blood cells dramatically increases this ratio, thereby increasing the rate of diffusion. 3. Hemoglobin (the oxygen - carrying protein in red blood cells) must bind and hold oxygen ( function ) in order to carry it through the bloodstream.

This is clearly seen in the names of muscles as illustrated in Table 12.1 . These names may refer to region, origin and insertion, shape, loca-tion, or function. For example, fl exor digitorum super cialis is a shallow (position) muscle that fl exes (action) the ngers (region). Table 12.1 is helpful in remembering the names of mus-cles and other organs. (Refer to Chapter One for activities designed to build a general knowledge of root words and an understanding of scienti c terminology.) 12.1 Form and Function in Machines Engineers apply the principles of science and mathematics to develop new products. Following is a list of engineering professions and their functions: Aerospace engineers design and test aircraft and spacecraft. Biomedical engineers design equipment to improve health, including arti cial limbs, monitoring equipment, and assistive devices such as pacemakers and insulin pumps. Chemical engineers integrate the principles of chemistry and engineering to develop machinery to manufacture chemicals or use ( structure ) of hemoglobin enables such binding. Oxygen is bound by electrostatic attraction to the central iron atom (Fe) and is protected from competing forces by the surrounding organic ring (Figure 12.1B ). 4. Oxygen binds tightly to iron, and if two iron - containing heme molecules come together in the presence of oxygen, the molecules will bind irreversibly, preventing further uptake or release. However, oxygen must be easily acquired in the lungs and easily released in respiring tissues ( function ) to sustain life. This is facilitated by the globin chains that pre-vent irreversible binding by folding around the oxygen binding site ( structure ), protect- ing it from the attractive forces of other heme groups (Figure 12.1C ). Many teachers introduce the structures of the heme group, hemoglobin molecule, or red blood cells apart from their functions, depriving stu- dents of the opportunity for true comprehension. Whenever possible, discuss structure and function at the same time, showing how structure determines function. This chapter provides a variety of activi- ties that can be used to demonstrate the relation-ship between structure and function in living and nonliving system. The anatomy and physiology activities in this chapter involve much terminology, so remind students that by understanding component root words, they can learn a great deal about the Oxygen binds to iron (Fe) within heme groupbiconcave - increases surface areasmooth surfaces - flows easilyoxygen bound loosely, entrapped by hemoglobin A B C Figure 12.1 Erythrocyte (A), Porphyrin Ring (B), and Three - Dimensional View of Hemoglobin (C) c12.indd 226 c12.indd 226 5/9/08 2:40:59 PM 5/9/08 2:40:59 PM Structure and Function in Science 227 chemicals for energy, electronics, food, cloth- ing, and other purposes.

Each device is designed to exercise a speci c muscle or collection of muscles. The design and structure of a machine determines its function for personal tness training. Just as each piece of equipment has a speci c structure and corresponding function, so each of the more than 650 muscles and 206 bones in the human body has a speci c structure and corresponding function. ACTIVITY 12.2.1 Structure and Function: Muscles T o fully understand the function of a muscle, it is necessary to understand its anatomy, particularly its origin and insertion. The origin of a muscle is de ned as the less moveable point of attachment, while the insertion is de ned as the more move- able point. For example, the sternocleidomastoid has its origin on the tops of the sternum and clavi-cle and its insertion on the mastoid process of the skull (Figure 12.4 ). When the left sternoclediomas-toid muscle contracts, the left side of the skull is pulled, causing the skull to rotate and tilt sideways to the left. Similarly, if the right sternoclediomas- toid contracts, the right side is pulled, rotating and tilting the skull sideways to the right. Note that this muscle gets its name from its origins, sterno - (sternum), cleido - (clavicle), and insertion, mastoid (mastoid process of the skull), while other muscles acquire their names from shape, location, or function (Table 12.4 ). Remember that nearly all scienti c terms are descriptive and can be under- stood if one knows the component roots (see Chapter One ). sternum (origin)mastoid process (insertion) clavicle(origin)sternocleidomastoid Figure 12.4 Origin and Insertion Table 12.4 Muscle Names Derived from Origin and Insertion, Shape, Location, or Function Origin and insertion shaped The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Muscles contract but do not extend unless pulled by an outside force such as an antagonistic muscle that pulls the opposite direction. Under most situations, when a muscle contracts, the bone of insertion moves toward the bone of ori-gin. For example, the origin of the biceps brachii is the scapula and upper humerus, and the inser-tion is the radius of the forearm. When the biceps contract, they fl ex the lower arm (Figure 12.5A ). The antagonist to the biceps is the triceps brachii, with origin in the scapula and upper humerus, and insertion in the elbow of the ulna. When the triceps contract, the lower arm extends (Figure 12.5B ). Table 12.5 shows the origin and insertion of some notable muscles of the body. Figure 12.6 indicates the attachments of 10 signi cant mus- cles. Examine the origin and insertion, and pre-dict the key action of each muscle, remembering that the insertion moves toward the origin. Determine one or more sports or activities that rely heavily on this muscle for a particular motion, and record your ideas in Table 12.5 . As you com-plete this activity, you are using knowledge of structure to predict function. insertionorigintriceps bic epsorigin insertionA B Figure 12.5 Motion of the Triceps and Biceps Table 12.5 Structure and Function of Muscles Muscle Location Origin Insertion Key Action Activity/Sport 1 deltoid shoulder clavicle, spine of scapula humerus raise arm, pull it forward or back swimming, pitching, jave-lin, shot - put 2 rectus abdominis front of torso pubis, front of pelvic bones lower ribs 3 gastrocnemius back of lower leg lower femur calcaneus (heel bone) 4 gluteus maximus back of the hip back of hip, sacrum pectoralis major chest sternum, clavicle humerus 6 front top of femur tibia 7 biceps brachii front of upper humerus radius (radial tuberosity) 8 triceps elbo 9 latissimus 10 biceps back of femur ischium femur bula ACTIVITY 12.2.2 Structure and Function: Bones The skeletal system provides structure and protec-tion and supports movement of the body. In many anatomy classes, students memorize numerous c12.indd 230 c12.indd 230 5/9/08 2:41:04 PM 5/9/08 2:41:04 PM Structure and Function in Science 231 features of bones without realizing their function. If, however, they know the structure of a bone fea- ture, they can predict the function. For example, examine the teeth in the human jaw (Figure 12.7 ). Note that the molars are positioned in the rear of the jaw, where leverage is greatest. Molars have a broad crown and base and multiple roots that allow them to withstand the great forces that occur when crushing and grinding food. The term molar means \" millstone, \" refl ecting the role of these teeth in grinding food. The premolars are in front of the molars and are also know as bicuspids because of the two ( bi - ) cusps, or bumps, on their surfaces. The bicuspids are positioned between the canines and the molars, and are transitional teeth that chew food and move it back to the molars for grinding. The canines are the sharpest teeth and derive their name from a word for dog (canine) because they resemble the sharp teeth wild dogs use to catch and tear their food. The front teeth are in the best position to cut food off and are named incisors because they function much like scissors as they cut up food. Note that they are the thin-nest and most planar of the teeth, a design that facilitates cutting. The structure and position of a tooth deter- mines its function, illustrating the importance of understanding structure in the light of function and vice versa. The same can be said for every bone in the body.

These vertebrae have the largest bodies because they must support the most weight. 2. This vertebra has the smallest body because it supports the least weight. 3. These vertebrae transmit the weight of the upper body to the hips through fused joints. 4. This vertebra has the largest foramen (open- ing) because the spinal cord is larger here than anywhere else in the spinal column. 5. These vertebrae have additional foramen (openings) in their transverse processes to protect the cranial nerves that parallel the spi-nal cord. 6.

The seeds that are produced have a genetic makeup distinct from either parent. Pollination is critical to the survival of fl owering plants, and fl owers are structured to facilitate pollination. For example, bees see partic-ularly well in the yellow, blue, and ultraviolet por-tions of the spectrum, and bee - pollinated fl owers are generally yellow or blue and often have ultra-violet markings (invisible to humans) so that they are easily seen by their pollinators. ACTIVITY 12.3.1 Structure and Function: Flowers and Pollinators Note: This activity is best performed when plants are fl owering in your region. Examine v e o r m o r e fl owers in your neigh- borhood, and predict pollinators by referring to the fl ower and pollinator characteristics in Table 12.6 . The fl owers of many trees and grasses Table 12.6 Flower Structure, Pollinator Characteristics, and Pollination Flower Characteristics Pollinator Characteristics Bee - pollinated fl owers are often blue or yellow with ultraviolet markings. Bees see well in the yellow, blue, and ultraviolet por- tions of the spectrum. Bee - pollinated fl owers produce sticky pollen. Bees have numerous hairs on their surface to which pollen may stick. Butterfl y - pollinated fl owers are often red and orange. Butterfl ies see well in the red and orange portions of the spectrum. Butterfl y - pollinated fl owers have long tubes. Butterfl ies have long probosci to extract nectar from long tubes. Moth - pollinated fl owers are often pale or white and open at night. Moths fl y at night when refl ectivity, not color, makes fl owers visible. Moth - pollinated fl owers emit a sweet odor. Moths are attracted to the sweet smell of nectar which serves as a food source. Fly - pollinated fl owers emit a rotten odor. Flies lay their eggs on dead animals and are attracted to rotten smells. Bird - pollinated fl owers are often red or yellow. Birds see well in the red and yellow portions of the spectrum. Bird - pollinated fl owers produce a fl uid nectar in large quantities. Birds consume nectar and lap it up with their tongues. Hummingbird - pollinated fl owers have long, tubular corolla. Hummingbirds have very long beaks to access tubu- lar fl owers. Beetle - pollinated fl owers often produce strong odors. Beetles are attracted to many strong odors . Beetle - pollinated fl owers are dull or white . Beetles do not see color but can see the light refl ected off white objects. Wind - pollinated fl owers have stamens and feathery stigma exposed to the wind. Wind is not focused or consistent, so fl owers must maximize the likelihood of fertilization. Wind - pollinated fl owers are small, numerous, and often green. Wind is inanimate and indiscriminate of size for Teaching Science are small and green, so you may need to look very carefully. If possible, photograph fl owers with a digital camera (Figure 12.9 ), and identify any pollinators that you see. Record the names and descriptions of each fl ower and the pollinator you observed or predicted. Identify the structures and features of the fl owers that serve speci c functions in attracting pollinators. ACTIVITY 12.3.2 Form and Function: Seed Dispersal Unlike animals, plants are unable to move to new environments and must rely on seed and spore dis-persal to deliver their offspring to new regions favo-rable for growth and development. Plants may rely on gravity, mechanical devices, wind, water, or ani-mals to distribute seeds. Many species of conifers rely on gravity. Heavy cones fall from pine, r, cedar, and other conifers, dispersing seeds on impact (Figure 12.10A ). Some plants rely on mechanical expulsion to spread their seeds (Figure 12.10B ). Stork ' s bill, oxalis, spurges, and many other weedy plants produce pods that explode, sending seeds to new environments. Wind is a particularly useful mechanism of seed dispersal for terrestrial plants. Wind - dispersed seeds are generally very light and may contain parachute - like devices such as those commonly found on dandelion seeds (Figure 12.10C ). Water is a useful distribution medium for plants that live in or near aquatic or marine envi-ronments. For example, coconut palms found on islands in the South Paci c produce large, buoyant fruits that can fl oat for thousands of miles and still germinate once washed ashore (Figure 12.10D ). Some plants disperse seeds by attaching to the fur of passing animals (Figure 12.10E ), while others produce edible fruit that animals harvest (Figure 12.10F ). Such plants produce seeds with a tough seed coat that protects them as they pass through the digestive tract before being deposited at some distance from the parent plant. Many trees produce nuts that squirrels or other rodents bury so they will have food during the winter (Figure 12.10G ). Finally, others, such as the peanut (Figure 12.10H ), bury their own seeds as stalks grow and push fruits underground. Many of these nuts are never found and eventually germinate. Photograph ve or more plants in your neigh- borhood that are producing cones or fruits. Tape photographs of these plants and their fruit to heavy cardstock. Tape seeds of each plant next to the appropriate photograph.

In other words, analyze the structure of the seeds and fruits to predict their function in seed dispersal. 12.4 Structure and Function at a Molecular Level The relationship between structure and function is found everywhere in the natural world, even at the atomic and molecular levels. Knowledge of the structure of a molecule helps in under-standing how it functions. For example, carbon can exist in a variety of forms, including graphite (Figure 12.11A ), diamond (Figure 12.11B ), and nanotubes (Figure 12.11C ). Carbon forms four bonds, and the nature of the bonding patterns (structure) determines the properties (functions) it will display. Each carbon in graphite bonds with three other carbons in a plane to form a hexagonal grid, as shown in Figure 12.11A (each junction represents a carbon). The fourth bond (dashed line) connects one plane with another. Although the three planar bonds are very strong, the fourth is relatively weak because it is so long. The elec-trons in this bond are free to move throughout the structure between the planes, making graph-ite a good conductor of electricity. The weakness of the bonds between planes allows them to slide across one another, making graphite slippery and an excellent lubricant. Graphite is used in pencil \" lead, \" and as the tip of the pencil moves across the page, a layer of carbon is left behind, which we recognize as handwriting, drawing, or scribbling. Contrast the structure of diamond with graphite (Figure 12.11B ). In the diagram, the black circles represent atoms as they are positioned in diamond, each with four bonds. The gray circles indicate carbons to which more will bond (four per carbon) to extend to the diamond ' s edges. In diamond, all four carbon bonds are of equal length and strength. All of the electrons are tightly bound, so there are no free electrons, and dia-mond therefore does not conduct electricity. The tetrahedral array makes diamond very strong (it is the hardest substance known) and gives it a very high melting point (much energy is required to break the bonds so it will fl ow). Carbon can also exist as nanotubes, which con- sist of graphite cylinders closed at either end with caps containing pentagonal rings (Figure 12.11C ). Carbon ' s fourth electron forms looser bonds with adjacent nanotubes, making nanotubes electrically conductive, as is graphite. The tubular shape gives nanotubes great tensile strength and many poten-tial applications. By examining the structure of graphite, diamond and nanotubes, we can see that the bonding pattern of a molecule determines its properties and potential applications. ACTIVITY 12.4.1 Structure and Function: Proteins (Online) Proteins perform a wide variety of biological func-tions. Some proteins provide structure for cells and organisms, while others serve as enzymes to catalyze biological reactions or provide immunity to disease. Proteins are high - molecular - weight substances formed by the bonding of amino acids. The struc-ture of each protein is determined at four levels: The primary structure of a protein is the sequence of amino acids. The secondary structure refers to patterned substructures, such as sheets or helices. T h e tertiary structure of a protein refers to its overall shape, formed primarily by hydro-gen bonds, ionic interactions, and disul de bonds. The quaternary structure is determined by the bonding of protein subunits to form a protein complex. AC B Figure 12.11 Carbon in Various Forms: (A) Graphite, (B) Diamond, (C) The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Proteins, like tools, have a speci c structure and a corresponding function. If the structure is altered, the function will be altered or destroyed. Figure 12.12A shows the structure of an imaginary enzyme whose tertiary structure is determined by disul de bonds. When heated, these bonds break; the protein loses its shape, becomes denatured, and ceases to function as an enzyme. Before heat-ing, the enzyme could interact with a substrate, but after heating, the enzyme ' s shape is altered so that no interaction can occur (Figure 12.12B ). Clearly the structure of a protein determines its properties and functions. Protein structure can be categorized as brous or globular. Figure 12.13A illustrates the structure of collagen, the most abundant protein in mam-mals and the main component of cartilage, liga-ments, tendons, and skin. Collagen is brous and ropelike, has great tensile strength, and provides support and integrity for a variety of connective tissues. By contrast, hemoglobin (Figure 12.13B ) is a globular protein, whose structure envelops and bonds four oxygen atoms that it carries to respir-ing tissues as it travels in red blood cells. In gen-eral, structural proteins are brous, and functional proteins are globular. The diagrams in Figures 12.13A and 12.13B were generated by a molecular visualization pro-gram that portrays the three - dimensional struc-ture of molecules. Many free software tools and protein data les are available on the Internet from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bio-informatics ' Protein Data Bank and other sources. Download the appropriate software so you can visualize any of the thousands of proteins available online. (T o nd it, go to sciencesourcebook.com or www.rcsb.org , or search \" rcsb, pdb, protein data bank. \" ) The following are lists of a few common pro- teins and their functions: Structural Proteins Collagen (primary structural component in bone and skin) Keratin (main structural component of hair and nails) Fibrin (primary structural component in blood clots) Elastin (a major structural component of ligaments) Functional Proteins Hemoglobin (transport protein that carries oxygen in the blood) DNA polymerase (enzyme that assists in DNA replication) ATPase (enzyme that breaks ATP to ADP to release energy for cell use) Amylase (digestive enzyme that breaks down polysaccharides such as starch) Alcohol dehydrogenase (enzyme that breaks down toxic alcohol molecules) -S - S- -S- S- -S - S--S protein disulfide bond broken binding siteopenbinding site destroyedsubstrateA B Figure 12.12 The Structure of a Protein Determines Its Function hemoglobin collagenAB Figure PM Structure and Function in Science 237 Insulin (hormone to regulate blood sugar lev- els in the body) Ferritin (storage protein that stores iron in the liver) Actin and myosin (contractile proteins that enable muscle contraction) Select a structural protein and a functional protein from the lists above.

(b) Download each protein ' s database le from an online protein data bank, and display the protein on your com-puter. Rotate the protein so you can view it from different angles, and print out representative views for your report. (c) In general, structural pro-teins are long and brous, connecting tissues with one another, while functional proteins are globu-lar, with highly speci c shapes that allow them to carry out speci c functions. Does this relationship between structure and function apply for the mol-ecules you have selected? Explain your answer. ACTIVITY 12.4.2 Structure and Function: Water The structure of a molecule determines its prop-erties. The relationship between structure and function is clearly seen in water, the most abun-dant molecule on the surface of the Earth and in living systems. Although water is commonplace, its properties are unlike any other molecule and vastly different from those with similar molecular weight. Water demonstrates a collection of unique properties that make it essential for life. The hydrogen - oxygen bond in water is polar covalent, such that the hydrogens acquire a partial positive charge and the oxygens a partial negative charge. The angle between the two hydrogens and the oxygen is 104.45 degrees, creating a bent mol-ecule in which the partial negative charge is on the side with the oxygen and the partial positive side is on the end with the two hydrogens. The structure of this bond makes water polar, and the positive end of one water molecule is attracted to the negative end of another (Figure 12.14A ). This attraction is known as hydrogen bonding and gives water a high surface tension as each molecule is attracted to others. From the following list of properties that result from the structure of the water molecule (104.45 degree bond angle), select one or more proper-ties and research their signi cance. (Y our teacher may assign different members of the class different properties and ask you to report back to the entire class.) (a) Write a paragraph explaining the impor-tance of the property you selected to life on earth, and (b) explain what would happen if water did not have its unusual structure, and consequently did not exhibit this characteristic. 1. High speci c heat (1 cal/ C; 75 J/mole K) 2. High surface tension 3. Strong cohesion (sticks to itself) 4. Strong adhesion (sticks to other things) 5. Excellent solvent (dissolves many things) 6.

Forms hexagonal - based crystals (snowfl akes) upon freezing (Figure 12.14B ) 12.5 Model Building In his classic work on the theory of multiple intel- ligences, 1 Howard Gardner argues that visual/ spatial intelligence is one of the basic forms of intelligence. Visual/spatial intelligence is the capac- ity to think in images and pictures and to visualize accurately and abstractly. Architects and engineers generally excel in this dimension. T o communi-cate and test their concepts, they often make mod-els or prototypes, thereby using their kinesthetic intelligence. Model building is an excellent activity for exercising visual/spatial and kinesthetic intelli-gence, and understanding the relationship between form and function. The following model - building activities can be used as individual or group projects and competitions. ACTIVITY 12.5.1 Bridge Building The goal of this competition is to build the bridge that supports the greatest weight before collapsing. The guidelines for the competition are: Materials Materials \u2014 1 pack of dry spaghetti Modi cations \u2014 noodles can be cut, notched, steamed, or boiled Adhesive \u2014 1 bottle of white glue Restrictions \u2014 no paint, varnish, or shellac Speci cations Mass \u2014 250 g or less Length \u2014 between 43 and 45 cm Width \u2014 between 4.5 and 7.0 cm Height \u2014 25 cm or less Roadbed \u2014 unobstructed so that a model car 3.5 cm wide can pass Opening \u2014 1 cm diameter hole in the center to insert the loading device Contest Loading device \u2014 a board 3.5 cm /H11003 2 cm /H11003 10 cm, with a 1 cm hole in middle Setup \u2014 align the hole in the loading device with the hole in the bridge T esting \u2014 insert the hook from below the roadbed, fasten with a threaded wing nut from above, and add weights to the hook until the bridge fails Failure \u2014 if the bridge collapses or bends 5 cm or more Winner \u2014 the team whose bridge supports the most weight before failing Y ou may also wish to perform this competi- tion using popsicle sticks (craft sticks) or balsa wood instead of spaghetti. In such cases, you may need to adjust the speci cations appropri- ately. What design features are correlated with the strongest bridges? ACTIVITY 12.5.2 Egg Drop The goal of this egg drop competition is to design a device that will prevent a raw egg from breaking when dropped from successively greater heights. The team whose egg sustains the greatest fall with-out breaking is declared the winner. Construct a device to protect a raw egg. The competition starts from a height of 2 m and increases by \u00bd m each round. If your egg survives a drop with-out cracking, it quali es for the next round. Impulse ( F /H9004 t ) is de ned as the product of a force ( F ) and the time interval ( /H9004 t ) during which it acts. It is equal to the change in momentum m /H9004 v , where m is the mass and /H9004 v represents the change in velocity. Thus: Ft mv/H9004/H9004= The egg is broken by the forces it encounters on impact. Solving for force, we have: F=mv 2:41:15 PM Structure and Function in Science 239 The impact force can be reduced by increas- ing the time over which the impact takes place ( /H9004 t ) by cushioning its fall. Boxers increase the time of impact and decrease the force by rolling with the punches. Baseball catchers, skydivers, and stunt-men do the same. The impact force can also be reduced by decreasing the change in velocity ( /H9004 v ) as the egg hits. This is accomplished by reducing the speed at which it hits the ground. Devices such as parachutes and wings may increase wind resist-ance, slow the egg, and thereby decrease the impact force. Y ou therefore want to design a device that slows the descent while cushioning the impact. Y ou may construct your device using any or all of the following materials: 10 plastic drinking straws 10 popsicle sticks 5 rubber bands 3 sheets of paper white glue 10 large paper clips 3 pipe cleaners 2 m of masking tape 1 m of yarn 1 plastic gro- cery bag 10 cotton puffs staples ACTIVITY 12.5.3 Water Bottle Rocket Design a water rocket according to the plans out-lined in Activity 16.5.1 (Observing High - Speed Activities). The rocket that travels the greatest dis-tance (given identical launch pressures) is declared the winner. ACTIVITY 12.5.4 Reconstructing a Skeleton Note to teacher: This activity uses sterilized owl pellets, which can be ordered from most scien-ti c curriculum supply companies. Owls eat small rodents and birds. Several hours after eating, the indigestible parts (fur, bones, teeth, and feathers) are compressed into a pellet that the owl regurgi-tates and expels. This \" owl pellet \" often contains all of the bones of the animal that the owl ate. Order sterilized owl pellets from a scienti c supply company (search \" owl pellet \" ). Wear latex gloves, and dissect the pellet with dissection tools. Reassemble the skeleton, and identify the organ-ism by comparing it with pictures of skeletons of mice, voles, shrew, lizards, and birds available on the Internet. ACTIVITY 12.5.5 Cell Model Make a three - dimensional model of a plant or animal cell illustrating as many of the following features as possible: cell membrane, cell wall, cyto-plasm, vacuoles. Y ou may use gelatin, fruit, beans, seeds, candies, plastic bags, pasta, pipe cleaners, and anything else you wish. Be creative. Include a key to identify each organelle. ACTIVITY 12.5.6 Anatomical Models Sci enti c supply companies provide models of the human body, skeleton, brain, heart, eye, knee, and other features. Y our teacher will provide a fully disassembled model, which you will reconstruct. ACTIVITY 12.5.7 Robotics Many schools offer classes and clubs in robot-ics in which students design, build, and program robots for various tasks. There are a variety of robotics competitions in which teams from vari-ous schools compete. For example, the FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and T echnology) robotics competition challenges teams to solve a common problem in a 6 week time frame using a standard set of parts. T eams compete to design a robot that will accomplish the task most ef ciently and effectively. Robotics pro- grams help students develop preengineering skills as they learn c omputer - aided design, pneumatics, motors, electronics, gears, fabrication, structures, and programming.

Handlebars are dropped so as to force the rider into a crouched position to minimize wind resistance. Road race bikes are extremely light to reduce inertia for quick starts and reduce the amount of work that must be done against friction during races. Touring bikes are for long - distance road rides. Their tires are wider than road racing bikes to ensure stability on a variety of paved surfaces. T ouring bikes often have 15 gears, c12.indd 239 2:41:19 PM 5/9/08 2:41:19 PM240 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science giving them a range of gear ratios without excessive weight. The frames are heavier and stronger than road racing bikes but lighter than mountain bikes whose strength is critical due to rugged terrain. Hybrid bikes are designed for casual on - and off - road riding. They have relatively wide tires to allow them to move on dirt roads, but only medium - knobbed tread to give suf - cient traction on dirt without excessive rolling resist-ance on pavement. Hybrids are relatively heavy bikes because speed is not a primary issue. Beach cruisers have very wide tires so they can ride on the wet sand and boardwalks. Beach cruisers are not designed for speed or hills, so they can be heavy and equipped with a single gear. 12.1.2 Structure and function: T ools (a) cutting wire (6) wire cutters (b) opening tin cans (1) tin can opener (c) gripping small objects (5) needle nose pliers (d) cutting (3) serrated knife (e) cutting through wood (4) saw (f) whittling wood (7) smooth knife blade (g) ling (8) le (h) turning single notch screws (9) fl athead screwdriver (i) measuring (10) ruler and straight edge (j) turning small single notch screws (2) small fl athead screwdrivers 12.2.1 Structure and Function: Muscles 12.2.2 Structure and function: Bones (1) F - lumbar, (2) B - atlas, (3) G - sacral, (4) B - atlas, (5) D - cervical, (6) C - axis, (7) E - thoracic, (8) B - atlas, (9) B - atlas, (10) G - sacral. 12.3.1 Structure and function: Flowers and pollinators. Student answers will vary. Students may wish to present a digital slide show using photographs they have taken of various fl owers. The teacher can guide a discussion regarding the relationship between fl o- ral structure and function. Alternatively, the teacher may download photographs of fl owers from a graphic library on the Internet and use them to discuss the relationships between fl owers and pollinators. 12.3.2 Structure and function: Seed dispersal. Student answers will vary. T eachers may wish to provide students access to digital video microscopes so they may take detailed photographs of seed or fruit features that may help dissemination. 12.4.1 Structure and function: Proteins. Student answers will vary, but they should all note that structural pro-teins tend to be long and brous while functional proteins are globular. 12.4.2 Structure and function: Water. Student answers will vary, but the following information may be included in student responses. 1 . High speci c heat: Water has a very high speci c heat (1 cal/g C). Since it requires a large amount of energy to change the temperature of water, substances contain-ing water resist rapid changes in temperature. Water can absorb a lot of heat energy before it begins to get hot, which is why it is a valuable coolant in industrial Muscle Location Origin Insertion Key Action Activity or Sport 1 deltoid shoulder clavicle, scapular spine humerus raise arm, pull it forward or back swimming, pitch- ing, tennis, shot put 2 rectus abdominis front of torso pubis, front of pelvis lower ribs fl exes spine sit - ups, wrestling 3 gastrocnemius back of lower leg lower femur calcaneus (heel bone) points toes down walking, running, hiking 4 gluteus maximus back of the hip back of hip, sacrum femur extends upper leg bicycling, climbing 5 pectoralis major sternum, clavicle humerus fl exes punch- ing, throwing, basketball 6 quadriceps femoris front of upper leg front, top of femur tibia extend tibia jumping, running, climbing, skiing 7 biceps brachii front of upper arm scapula, upper humerus radius fl exes lower arm chinning, lifting weights with arms 8 triceps brachii back of upper arm scapula, upper humerus elbo (ulna) extend lower arm pushing, throwing, tennis 9 latissimus dorsi sides of back lower vertebrae humerus pulls arms down and to sides rowing, kayaking, canoeing 10 biceps femoris exes 240 5/9/08 2:41:20 PM 5/9/08 2:41:20 PM Structure and Function in Science 241 processes and in automobile radiators. Seventy - one percent of the Earth ' s surface is covered by water, sta-bilizing the temperature of the planet. Regions near oceans enjoy a much more equable climate (less varia-tion in temperature) than those inland. Nearly 60 per- cent of the mass of our bodies is composed of water. Since water has a high speci c heat, body tempera- tures remain much more constant than if they were composed of a solvent other than water. If water did not have its unusual structure and resulting high spe-ci c heat, the temperature of organisms and the planet would vary too much and too quickly for organisms to survive. 2 . High surface tension: Water has a very high surface ten- sion, as the positive ends of one molecule are attracted to the negative ends of others. This high surface ten-sion reduces the amount of evaporation that occurs from oceans, lakes, and streams. If water did not have its unusual structure and resulting high surface tension, it would evaporate more readily and be less avail-able for consumption by animals. In addition, insects would sink when landing on water, thereby altering the aquatic food chain. 3 . Strong cohesion: Water molecules are attracted to each other by electrostatic attraction. As water molecules ascend the xylem of plants, others follow, creating a coherent stream of water. If water did not have its unu- sual structure and resulting cohesiveness, it could not be pulled up within xylem vessels, and terrestrial plants could not exist. 4 . Strong adhesion: Water is polar and adheres to sub- stances that have polar regions. The xylem (water con-ducting tubes) of plants is made of cellulose (the main component of wood), a macromolecule with polar regions. If water did not have its unusual structure and resulting adhesiveness to substances like cellulose, then it would drain out of terrestrial plants and we would not have any trees, shrubs, or crops. 5 . Excellent solvent: The 104.45 degree bond angle of water makes it an excellent solvent. Minerals, carbo-hydrates, nucleic acids, and most proteins easily dis-solve in water. Essential minerals, such as calcium, iron, magnesium, and sodium, dissolve in water as positively charged ions known as cations. Once dis-solved, they can be transported in the xylem of plants or in the bloodstreams and interstitial fl uids of ani- mals to the cells where they are required. All cells of all organisms are based on water. If water did not have its unusual structure and resulting solvent properties, no life could exist, as there would be no medium for mol-ecules and nutrients to interact or be delivered. 6 . Exists in three states (solid, liquid, gas) on Earth: Water is the only natural substance that is found in solid, liq-uid, and gaseous form on the surface of the Earth. If water did not have its unusual structure and exist in a gaseous phase in the atmosphere, there would be no evaporation from the oceans, no rain would fall on the continents, and the continents would be massive deserts. If water did not exist as a solid, there would be no snow and no glaciers. Runoff would be much more rapid, and streams and rivers would be much less pre-dictable in many regions of the world. 7 . High boiling point (100 C): Water boils at 100 C, while methane, a similarly sized molecule (MW water = 18 g/mole; MW methane = 16 g/mole), boils at /H11002 162 C. Methane is a symmetrical molecule, while water is polar. As a polar molecule, water adheres to itself and resists a phase change. If water did not have its unusual structure and resulting high boiling point, life could not exist at common temperatures on Earth because it would be gaseous rather than liquid. 8 . High melting point (0 C): The melting point of water is approximately 100 C higher than what one would predict based on comparison with other group - 6 hydrides. In ice, all water molecules participate in four hydrogen bonds (two as donor and two as acceptor) and are held relatively static. This is due to the unusual structure of the water molecule. Thus, ice is stable at temperatures below 0 C. Ice is an important reservoir of fresh water, particularly for mountainous regions in Central Asia and other places that rely on glacial melt for much of their water. In addition, ice sculpts the landscape through glacial action, carving such fea-tures as Y osemite Valley and the numerous lakes that are scattered over Canada and the northern United States . If water did not have its unusual structure and resulting high melting point, ice would not exist in suf- cient quantity to sculpture the landscape and frac- ture rocks. Soils would be scarcer, and there would be less vegetation. 9 . Expands on freezing: Most liquids contract as they are cooled because molecules slow down, and the attrac-tive intermolecular forces draw them closer to each other. As most substances solidify, they form tightly packed crystalline solids, with a density greater than that of the liquid phase. Water, like other substances, gets denser as it cools, but only until 4 C. As it is cooled below this temperature, water expands until its nal volume is approximately percent larger than an equivalent quantity of liquid water. This property of water is due to the polar structure of the bent water molecule. There is a strong tendency to form a net-work of hydrogen bonds, where each hydrogen atom is in a line between two oxygen atoms. The resulting structure is much more open than the liquid phase and therefore has lower density. As water freezes in cracks of rocks, it expands and fractures the rocks, helping to create the soil that is vital for terrestrial plant life. If water did not have its unusual structure and thus expand on freezing, ice would sink and even- tually cover the fl oors of many lakes and much of the oceans. Ice would build up, leaving small layers of melted water on the surface. Fish and other aquatic and marine life would not be as protected from sea-sonal variations in temperature, and thus would be less able to survive. c12.indd 241 c12.indd 241 5/9/08 2:41:21 PM 5/9/08 Sourcebook Teaching 1 0 . Highest heat of vaporization (540 cal/g; 40.6 KJ/mole) of any liquid : T he bent molecular shape of water makes the water molecule polar and leads to hydrogen bonding. Even at the boiling point (100 C), approxi-mately 75 percent of all water molecules are engaged in hydrogen bonds with other molecules. T o overcome this bonding and release water molecules to the gase-ous phase, much energy must be applied. Each gram of water requires 540 calories of energy to vaporize. Evaporative cooling occurs whenever water is vapor-ized from the surface of an organism. As animals sweat, they lose heat energy. Sweating is an extremely important form of temperature regulation, particu- larly when environmental temperatures exceed body temperature and one can no longer lose heat by con-tact or radiation to the local environment. If water did not have its unusual structure and resulting high heat of vaporization, animals could not cool themselves by sweating or panting, and many would get sick or die when ambient temperatures exceeded 40 C. 1 1 . Water forms hexagonal crystals (snowfl akes) on freezing: Water molecules form a hexagonal lattice that grows into a snowfl ake with sixfold symmetry, as shown in Figure 12.14B . Snowfl akes have a very high ratio of surface area to volume and thus fall very slowly. They have sharp, planar surfaces that refl ect light, making snow appear white and brilliant. Snow and ice refl ect light from the Earth ' s surface, helping to keep the glo-bal climate constant and the environment suitable for life. If water did not have its unusual structure and resulting hexagonal crystalline shape, ice would not be as refl ective, much more light would be absorbed on ice elds, and the Earth ' s temperature would increase. Some scientists are concerned that the rate of global warming will increase as polar ice caps melt because less light will be refl ected from the surface of the Earth, and consequently, more energy absorbed. c12.indd 242 c12.indd 242 5/9/08 2:41:21 PM 5/9/08 2:41:21 PM243Chapter Thirteen Games for Learning Science For the Teacher 243 13.1 Science Jeopardy 244 13.2 Science Taboo 247 13.3 Science Bingo 248 13.4 Science Pictionary 248 13.5 Science Bowl 250 13.6 Science Baseball 252 13.7 What in the World? 252 13.8 Twenty Questions 255 13.9 Logic Games 256 For the Teacher Science teachers employ classroom games to review course work, stimulate interest, and pro-mote teamwork. 1 This chapter discusses the poten- tial uses of classroom games and provides detailed instructions on a variety that are well suited for secondary school science classrooms. Classroom games provide an active alternative to traditional review sessions, which are often pas-sive, teacher - centered events that require minimal student involvement. Reviews that simply tell stu-dents what will be on the exam, present informa-tion in a repetitive manner, or require little student involvement are largely ineffective and should be replaced by activities centering on students and requiring their participation. Active learning events such as classroom games are more effective in promoting student learning than teacher - centered review sessions. 2 Students are likely to study in preparation for the game and again for the test, par-ticularly if the game has highlighted their areas of weakness. All games are more interesting when teams are of equal ability. Fans pour out of baseball stadiums during the seventh inning if there is a wide margin in the score but stay and cheer if the score remains close. In a similar manner, students lose interest if teams are mismatched in ability and performance. The losing team has a tendency to give up and the winning team a tendency to slack off. For this reason, it is best to arrange teams so that all have roughly equivalent abilities. Students join sports teams not only for love of the game but also for the camaraderie that devel-ops among team members. A team ' s performance c13.indd 243 c13.indd 243 5/9/08 6:09:08 PM Sourcebook for Teaching Science games ( competitions between the best players from different periods), and superbowls (competitions between the best teams). Ranking can be based on a win - loss record or the cumulative percentage of questions answered correctly, or both. Enthusiasm grows when the games are well developed and well executed. This enthusiasm can be shared with the school by holding all - star and superbowl contests during lunch break or after school in the auditorium or school quad. Many teachers offer an extra - credit incentive for teams that win games or champion-ships but nd that the need for extra credit dimin- ishes as enthusiasm grows. With time, students may be more motivated by the game than by any extra - credit points they might earn by winning the game. Benjamin Franklin said, \" Trouble springs from idleness, and grievous toil from needless ease. \" Guard against idleness by designing games so all students are engaged in the learning process. Whenever possi-ble, games should involve the entire class, and ques-tions or tasks should rotate among team members. Y ou may ask students to submit questions to be entered in a database for future use. Screen all questions for accuracy and appropriateness. If you maintain them in a database le, you may print them in tabular form so they may be easily cut up and drawn from a hat. There should be a judge (generally you) who rules on all game activities. The judge should be impartial and accurate, and his or her rulings should stand. Grievances should be dealt with after the game and outside class so as not to distract from academic tasks. 13.1 Science Jeopardy Science Jeopardy is a classroom game patterned after the popular television game show Jeopardy. In most games, tests, or classroom drills, students provide answers to questions posed by their teach-ers. In Science Jeopardy, students create questions to answers provided by teachers. The example illus-trates this difference: Traditional Method: Question Precedes Answer Teacher: What biome is found north of the taiga? Student: Tundra. is based on the dedication and skill of all its play- ers, and members encourage one another to excel for the collective good. Unfortunately, there are relatively few team activities in the academic arena. Students compete for grades and class rank and may be hesitant to help one another for fear that their efforts might \" raise the curve. \" By con-trast, games promote teamwork, an attitude and skill that are invaluable in every aspect of life. T eachers should assemble teams, appoint cap-tains, and allow members to create team names consistent with course content. For example, biology students may create team names such as the Phosphorylators, Catabolists, or Active Transporters, and chemistry students may chose names such as the Catalysts, Ionizers, or Solutions. We often think of peer pressure as negative, but it can also be a positive tool, particularly in class-room management. Students understand that the performance of a team is dependent on the coop-eration and performance of all of its members. When they understand that disorderly conduct adversely affects the team score, members are likely to hold teammates accountable for their behavior. It may be wise to use the same teams for labora-tory experiments and group activities so as to fur-ther promote teamwork and discipline. Instructors should use simple cues to remind students of the behavior expectations. For example, you may wish to keep an overhead transparency with team names on it. Whenever there is a discipline prob-lem, move the transparency to the projector and students will understand that you are about to subtract points from a disorderly team. Students will recognize the cue and quickly get their teams in order. Such student - centered management approaches are generally much more effective than teacher - centered techniques, such as raising one ' s voice or calling out speci c individuals. Because of the bene ts in classroom man- agement that may accompany the use of games, it is generally a good idea to maintain team com-position long enough to build camaraderie and accountability. When team organization remains constant throughout a semester, it is possible to develop leagues (different class periods), rank-ings (team placement within a period), all - star c13.indd 244 c13.indd 244 5/9/08 6:09:08 PM 5/9/08 6:09:08 Learning Science 245 Jeopardy: Answer Precedes Question Teacher: The answer is \" tundra. \" Student: What biome is found north of the taiga? Student: What cold - weather biome is dominated by grasses? Student: What biome is found in northern Alaska, Canada, and Russia? Student: What biome has permafrost and short growing seasons? Because Science Jeopardy requires students to generate questions in response to answers rather than answers in response to questions, it assesses comprehension in addition to knowledge. There is often more than one correct question for each answer. Figure 13.1 illustrates a jeopardy board prior to a game. The numbers represent point values and hide answers written beneath. The game board can be made on an overhead transparency. Each answer is covered by a sticky note that is removed when the item is selected. Alternatively, an electronic version can be made using PowerPoint slides or a Word document in which answers are placed in a table and covered by opaque rectangles made with the drawing tool (see sciencesourcebook.com or search \" jeopardy template \" ). As with any other classroom game, adjust the organization and rules to meet the speci c needs of the class. A team of ve is suggested, one of whom is selected as captain. A different captain is selected for each game. Table 13.1 is a sample game with questions to show possible responses. ACTIVITY 13.1.1 Play Science Jeopardy The teacher conducts Science Jeopardy according to the following rules. The categories and answers are chosen to relate to current class content: Opening: The lowest - ranked team starts rst. If both teams have equal rank, the order is determined by fl ipping a coin. (Ranking is based on win and loss record or the total number of points earned in previous games.) Selecting answers: The team captain selects an answer (e.g., \" Cells for 300 \" ) for which all lower values in the category have already been selected. For example, Cells 100 and Cells 200 must be selected before Cells 300 may be selected. All teams try to generate a question that has the given answer. Response: During the rst 30 seconds, only the team that made the selection can respond. If they have not drafted a question within the rst 30 seconds, any other team captain can raise his or her hand. If two captains raise their hands simultaneously, the answer is given to the lower - scoring team. Providing the question: The team captain selects an individual to read the team ' s ques-tion. The same individual cannot be selected more than once in a row. Scoring: Points are awarded for a well - phrased question that has the speci ed answer. No points are taken off for incorrect answers, except in Final Jeopardy. The harder the ques-tion, the higher its point value. Next answer: The rst team with a correct question is given the privilege of choosing the next answer. A team is not allowed to select more than two answers in a row. After that, the lowest - scoring team is given that privilege. Ending the game: Jeopardy is completed when all answers have been revealed or at the discre-tion of the teacher. The teams now proceed to Final Jeopardy, the closing round in which \u007f \u007f \u007f\u007f \u007f \u007f\u007f 100 200 300 400 500100 200 300 400 500100 200 300 400 500100 200 300 400 500200 300 400 500Cells Tissues Organs Systems Organisms amoeba100 Figure 13.1 Science Jeopardy Board c13.indd 245 6:09:09 PM 5/9/08 6:09:09 PM246 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science teams have the opportunity to wager any or all of their points with the hope of winning . Wagers: The teacher announces the category of the Final Jeopardy answer before wagers are made. Each team may wager any or all of its points. Each captain must write the team ' s wager on paper and give it to the teacher. Final Jeopardy: The teacher reads the Final Jeopardy answer, and all teams write their \u007f \u007f questions within 2 minutes. T eams use this time to build consensus and compose a question on paper that they submit to the instructor. Final Jeopardy points: If the team has a cor- rect question, it receives as many points as wagered, but if the question is incorrect, they lose this number of points.

In particu-lar, he noticed that the T ongans had many rules, based on ritualistic distinctions, that prohibited certain actions. The T ongans referred to such for-bidden behaviors as taboo. It was taboo to touch tribal chiefs, travel in certain areas of the forest, and engage in various other seemingly harmless activities. The punishment for doing something taboo was often quite serious. The Hasbro Company played on the taboo con- cept when it introduced a popular party game by the same name. In Taboo, players must describe a tar-get term to their partners without using any taboo terms (forbidden words ) frequently associated with it. For example, a team representative may have to explain gravity without mentioning \" Earth, \" \" apple, \" \" Newton, \" \" attraction, \" or \" fall. \" The team scores if they guess \" gravity \" within the allotted time. Science Taboo is a classroom game based on the party game. It is designed to test student understanding of scienti c concepts. A repre- sentative of one team draws a card such as shown in Figure 13.2 and must explain the target term without using any of the ve taboo terms below it. For example, a team representative who drew the term \" telescope \" would have to explain this con-cept so teammates could guess it but would have to do so without using any of the taboo terms: \" star, \" \" astronomer, \" \" observatory, \" \"planet, \" or \" look. \" Science Taboo tests the ability of the repre- sentative to explain science concepts in his or her own words. In traditional settings, a student could \" explain \" by parroting a glossary de nition. By con- trast, in Taboo, the person must convey concepts in his or her own words. A student who is able to explain a term without using taboo terms probably has a good understanding of the target term. Figure 13.2 illustrates some sample Taboo cards. The target word is in bold at the top of the column, and the taboo terms appear below it. The student cannot use any of these words, or their derivatives, when explaining the concept to team mates. Following are sample explanations that a team representative might use to explain the target term without using the taboo terms: Telescope : This instrument is used to observe cosmic objects. Photosynthesis : This plant process xes carbon dioxide into sugars. Earthquake : A sudden, violent, movement of the earth. Convection : The transference of thermal energy by the movement of a fl uid. ACTIVITY 13.2.1 Play Science Taboo The teacher conducts Science Taboo as described below. The topics and terms should relate to cur-rent class content. Make Taboo cards: Make taboo cards using tar- get terms relevant to the curriculum. I suggest selecting taboo terms (the forbidden words) from those found in glossary or dictionary de nitions of the target term (Figure 13.3 ). The teacher may ask students to make cards for competitions in other classes. Teams: Split the class into two or more teams, and select a captain for each. The captain determines the order in which team members will serve as the referee and representative. Game play: The rst team chooses a representa- tive to explain target terms. The heat risecoldsinkdensetarget term taboo terms Figure 13.2 Taboo CardsWatt - the SI unit of power , equivalent to 1 joule per second, corresponding to the power in an electric circuit in which the potential difference is 1 volt and the current 1 amp.Watt unit powerjouleelectricpotentialglossary definition taboo termstarget termtaboo card Figure 13.3 Constructing Taboo Cards from Glossary The Sourcebook for Teaching Science gives an explanation for the term without using use any of the taboo words or their derivatives. The representative has 1 minute to explain as many target terms as his or her team can guess. Referee: A referee from the next team is chosen to ensure none of the taboo words are used. If any are used, the referee sounds a buzzer or bell, and the remainder of the turn is forfeited. Transition: After the 1 minute turn has expired, the student who served as referee becomes the representative for the team and draws a new target term. Students serve as referees immedi-ately prior to serving as representatives. There should always be a representative and a referee in front of the class. Team response: T eam members shout answers in response to the clues given by their repre-sentative. The teacher awards points whenever a correct answer is given and immediately gives the team representative a new card until the 1 minute turn has expired. No points are given if a team guesses a term after the 1 minute buzzer. Scoring: Three points are awarded for each target term that is guessed. If a taboo term is used, the representative ' s turn is immediately ended. The representative may elect to pass a term for at a cost of 1 point. The representa-tive is then given another taboo card. Illegal techniques: The representative cannot say \" sounds like \" or use physical movements to explain the term. If such actions are used, the team ' s turn is forfeited. Winning: The teacher determines the number of rounds that are played. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. 13.3 Science Bingo Science students memorize large numbers of new terms, many of them abstract and dif cult to understand. T o assess student understanding, teachers often ask students to de ne terms. Unfor- tunately students may be able to memorize de ni- tions and repeat them on tests or quizzes, but have no real understanding of their meaning or signi - cance. T o ensure that students truly understand \u007f \u007f \u007f\u007f \u007f \u007fde nitions, teachers can turn to Science Bingo or a similar activity that assesses their understanding rather than mere memorization. Unlike the popu-lar Bingo game, Science Bingo is based on skill and understanding rather than chance. ACTIVITY 13.3.1 Play Science Bingo Vocabulary list: The teacher develops a list of 25 or more words for the game (Figure 13.4 ). Setup: Students construct a ve - by - ve grid on a sheet of paper and ll the grid with terms from the list, as shown in Figure 13.4 . Each term may appear only once. De nitions: The teacher reads de nitions and their corresponding numbers. For example, if the rst term to be identi ed is cellulose, the teacher should say, \" Number 1: The main component of cell walls. \" Identifying terms: When students hear a de ni- tion and associate it with a term on their grid, they put the clue number in the appropriate cell. Winning: Students say \" Bingo! \" when they have identi ed ve terms in a row, column, or diagonal. The teacher must look at the stu-dent ' s card to ensure that the numbers associ-ated with the terms match the numbers of the de nitions read. Continue reading terms until at least ve students have achieved Bingo. 13.4 Science Pictionary It has been said that a picture is worth a thou- sand words, and yet many educators do not take full advantage of diagrams and drawings in their instruction. Winn and Holiday summarized the bene ts of using diagrams in instruction as follows: (1) Diagrams help learners because they direct attention to important information, replac-ing critical verbal information with graphic devices such as lines and arrows; (2) diagrams help low - verbal learners overcome some of their dif culty with language by providing information in a form they can handle more easily; (3) through the use of normal left - right, top - bottom layout, arrows and other graphic \u007f Learning diagrams can teach sequences of events effectively; [and] (4) the addition of study questions to diagrams helps learners by direct-ing their attention to critical information. 3 Students as well as teachers need to develop the skill of diagramming concepts rather than simply copying those developed by others. Science Pictionary is a game that helps develop such skills. Science Pictionary is patterned after the popu- lar party game invented by Pictionary Incorporated in which team members communicate concepts and terms through drawings that do not use standard let-ters, numbers, or other common symbols. Students with a good understanding of a concept can dia-gram it in a way that others can recognize without the use of written or spoken words. Figure 13.5 illus-trates some sample Science Pictionary drawings and 183 2 4 95 1 3 1 17 8 15 6 16 1112 10 24 18 9 95 138 156 1611Bingo!possible termsCard made by student 1 Card made by student 2 (1) A unit of pressure equal to 1 mm Hg.

The definitions of 19-26 would be read if Bingo had not been reached.

Note that drawings should be simple and represent key ideas. For example, the atherosclerosis diagram shows a clogged artery and indicates it might lead to a heart attack, and the sub-duction diagram shows downward - moving rock and the corresponding formation of volcanoes. The goal is to illustrate key concepts as simply as possible. ACTIVITY 13.4.1 Play Science Pictionary Teams: The class is divided into teams, and captains are assigned or elected. The teacher determines the number and size of teams. Lineup: The team captain determines the sequence in which students from his or her team will draw. The opportunity to draw alter-nates between teams. Drawing: The drawer is given a science term or concept that he or she must represent on the overhead, whiteboard, or blackboard. The drawer may not say anything, make any ges-tures, or draw any letters or common symbols other than arrows. Team response: As the student draws, his or her team members shout out terms they think the diagram represents. The drawer cannot say anything except to knowledge a correct guess. Scoring: When a correct term is guessed, the team is awarded a number of points equiva-lent to the number of seconds it took team-mates to guess the term. If the student ' s team has not guessed the term correctly after 60 seconds, they get 60 points and the other team is given 10 seconds to guess the term. If the other team is correct, 10 points are subtracted from their score. A student may pass a dif cult term for a 10 point penalty. Completion of the game: The instructor deter- mines an appropriate number of questions for the game. The team with the fewest points (least time to communicate concepts through drawing) wins the game. 13.5 Science Bowl Since 1953 the College Bowl Company has been producing College Bowl as a live event for television and radio. More recently, the company \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007f introduced High School Bowl and international versions of College Bowl. The company has received an Emmy, as well as congressional and presidential citations for promoting academics through the popular media. Science Bowl, a modi- ed version of the academic game, can be used to stimulate learning and enthusiasm for science while promoting class spirit. Students from basic to Advanced Placement courses have enthusiastically received Science Bowl. The instructor plays the role of a game show host and sports announcer, emceeing the game and building enthusiasm through \" play - by - play \" analysis. This activity assesses knowledge and comprehension of scien-ti c facts and may be used prior to examinations so students have basic facts before they encounter higher - order questions on examinations. ACTIVITY 13.5.1 Play Science Bowl Team size: Science Bowl can be conducted with teams of any size, depending on the needs and the time available. If you have an entire class period, you may wish to have numerous small teams and run three or four games. If you have less than half an hour, it is better to split the class in two and conduct just one game. I sug-gest that you keep team composition the same for at least one quarter to foster the develop-ment of team camaraderie and accountability. Assigning teams: Games are much more inter- esting to watch and play if they are evenly matched. It is therefore good to make teams as equal as possible. Each member should be assigned a number and a letter as shown in Figure 13.6 . Note that the numbering and let-tering are done so that no two students have the same coordinates. This allows the teacher \u007f \u007f ABC D E 123 4 5Team 1 ABC D E 1 2 3 4 5Team 2 student performance Figure 13.6 Coordinates of Team Members c13.indd 250 c13.indd 250 5/9/08 6:09:11 PM 5/9/08 6:09:11 PMGames for Learning Science 251 to pair up different individuals. A question asked of A ' s will match student A1 on team 1 with student A5 on team 2, and a question asked of 1 ' s will match student A1 on team 1 with student E1 on team 2. Figure 13.7 illus-trates how to arrange students in larger groups so that you can better match scores to keep games competitive. For example, if team 1 is behind, the teacher might ask questions of A ' s favoring team 1. By contrast, if team 2 is behind, the teacher might ask questions of 1 ' s, thereby favoring team 2. The teacher should not disclose the rationale for the seating arrangements. Questions: The teacher maintains a bank of questions pertinent to the curriculum. These questions may be developed by former students and kept in a database le for ease of access. Designated questions \u2014 1 point: When the teacher calls C, only students with a C des-ignation can answer. Similarly, when the instructor calls \" 3 ' s, \" only those with a des-ignation of 3 can answer. Sometimes two or more sets can be identi ed, such as \" 1 ' s and D ' s. \" If no one answers the question in the allotted time (generally 10 seconds), you can open it up to other combinations. Students will remain alert if there is always a chance that their number or letter will be called. Toss - up questions \u2014 1 point: These questions can be answered by any team member. Team questions \u2014 3 points: The time limit is tripled (30 seconds) for these questions because they require consultation. They are more dif cult or multipart questions and must be answered by the team captain or his or her designee after consensus has been reached. \u007f Sample questions for genetics: \" What is the sequence of nucleotides in a start codon? \" (designated or toss - up ques-tion, 1 point) \" When does synapsis of homologous chro-mosomes occur? \" (designated or toss - up question, 1 point) \" In what stage does DNA synthesis occur? \" (designated or toss - up question, 1 point) \" Describe three steps of the Sanger proc-ess for gene sequencing. \" (team question, 3 points) \" How many different gametic genotypes are possible for an individual heterozygous at 5 loci? \" (team question, 3 points) \" Give the correct names for the following symbols: A, C, G, T, U, DNA, RNA. \" (team question, 3 points) Scoring: The rst eligible student to raise his or her hand or press the buzzer after the ques-tion has been asked must answer the question. A student who raises his or her hand before the question has been completed must answer immediately, without the bene t of whatever else might have been said. If the student is cor-rect, his or her team scores and the teacher poses another question. If the student is incorrect, his or her opponents are read the remainder of the question and given the full time to respond. There are no penalties for wrong answers. If a student raises his or her hand or hits the buzzer out of turn, it is an automatic forfeit, and the opposing team has the opportunity to answer the question without competition. Ranking: T eams are ranked on the basis of their win - loss record. If two teams have iden-tical records, their rankings will then be based on the total percentage of points that their team has earned throughout the year. Special awards: Although this game is designed as a team sport, you may wish to record indi-vidual scores and recognize the most valuable players (MVPs). Special games: If you have multiple sections of a class, you may wish to hold all - star or super-bowl games in which the best students or team from one class compete with the best students \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007f ABC 1 2 3AB C 1 2 3 student performanceTeam 1 Team 2 Figure 13.7 Arrangements for Larger Teams c13.indd 251 c13.indd 251 5/9/08 6:09:11 PM 5/9/08 6:09:11 PM252 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science or team from another. These games can be held at lunch or after school. When held in a public place like the gymnasium or quad, the games may draw a crowd and build interest in your program among future students. 13.6 Science Baseball Every science class has students with a range of abilities and interests. Students have differences in prior knowledge, interest, and motivation yet rarely are given individual assignments tailored to their abilities and needs. This lack of individu-alization is true in many classroom games as well: all students are asked the same questions and assigned the same tasks. In contrast to most other games, Science Baseball offers a degree of indi-vidualization by providing the option to select the level of dif culty of the question asked. Science Baseball may hold interest for sports - minded students because of the analogy with America ' s pastime. Students will be enthusiastic if the teacher is enthusiastic. A teacher who comes to class in an umpire ' s shirt, announces plays and scores like a sportscaster, and decorates the class-room with baseball paraphernalia will generate much greater interest than one who does nothing extra. Enthusiasm is contagious, but so is apathy. ACTIVITY 13.6.1 Play Science Baseball Questions: Develop a set of questions, and cat- egorize them in four groups (singles, doubles, triples, and home runs) according to dif culty. Students may be asked to develop questions for use in other classes. Recording play: Project a baseball diamond on the screen, or draw a replica on the board. Record the scores and names of the players as illustrated in Figure 13.8 . Lineups: Split the class into two teams and deter- mine a lineup sequence for each, or appoint team captains and allow them to make the line-ups. Each student \" comes to bat \" according to position in the lineup and selects the dif culty of the question to be asked. Singles are easiest and home runs the most dif cult. The teacher \u007f \u007f \u007freads a question aloud from the appropriate cat- egory and gives the \" batter \" a standard amount of time to respond. Scoring: If the \" batter \" answers the question correctly, the instructor writes his or her ini-tials by the appropriate base (Figure 13.8 ). Wrong answers are considered an \" out. \" Each team is allowed three outs per inning. The game is scored like baseball, with points given for each \" runner \" who crosses home plate. Play as many innings as time permits. 13.7 What in the World? Science concepts are often best represented graphi- cally, and teachers assess understanding by requir-ing their students to draw or label diagrams. For example, it is common to ask biology students to label the bones or organs on a diagram of the body or the organelles on a stylized model of a cell. Unfortunately, such tests are often more an indi-cator of a student ' s ability to memorize a particu-lar diagram than an indicator of his or her level of understanding. For example, students may be able to accurately label all of the bones on a diagram of the skeleton from their textbook but unable to identify the same bones on a model or disarticu-lated skeleton. \u007fScience Baseball Marie C.George W.

For example, a student who truly understands the anatomy of the femur will not only be able to identify it on the diagram from which he or she studied but also from X - rays or photographs taken from different angles and dia-grams drawn from different perspectives. In addi-tion, this student will be able to locate the bone on himself or herself, or identify it from a model when blindfolded. It is the teacher ' s responsibility to stress the signi cant features of the objects studied and provide a rich learning environment in which students will be exposed to examples from a vari-ety of sources. What in the World? is a game that requires students to identify familiar objects in unfamiliar views and thereby assesses their ability to generalize, transfer, and extrapolate. Select a series of images related to your lesson using a graphic search engine (see sciencesource book.com or images.google.com ). T o encourage the development of transference skills (the ability to recognize similar features in dissimilar envi-ronments), select images that portray the objects of interest from new perspectives. For example, if your textbook illustrates chloroplasts diagram-matically, then obtain images of chloroplasts taken with a scanning or transmission electron micro-scope. In order to identify novel images of famil-iar objects, students must be able to differentiate relevant from irrelevant information. Although the diagram in the book may show the chloro-plast as a green structure, the micrograph from a transmission electron microscope will display it in black and white. Students must recognize that color is not a key feature in this situation because transmission electron microscopes use electrons rather than light to create images. Similarly, the diagram in the text may present the chloroplast in a three - dimensional manner, while the micro-graph shows only a thin section through the center of the organelle. Students must therefore look for distinctive features, such as grana stacks, that will appear in both diagrams and micrographs. What in the World? can also be used to develop extrapolation skills: the ability to get the big pic-ture from small portions of a picture. Collect large digital images of things you have studied. Using a graphics - editing program such as PhotoShop or your digital photo album software, select a closeup view of just a portion of the image, and incor-porate this into your game. For example, if you have been studying fl ies, display just a portion of the compound eye of a fl y (Figure 13.9 ) 4 to see if students can extrapolate from this to identify the organ or organism from which it was taken. Locate and download images to your personal computer, and reference their sources as outlined in Chapter Three . Import these graphics in an appropriate sequence into an electronic slide sorter or presen- tation manager such PowerPoint. ACTIVITY 13.7.1 Play What in the World? Create a game: Create a slide show using PowerPoint, slide viewer software, or a pres-entation manager ( nd images at sciencesource book.com or images.google.com ). The images and questions should be related to your cur-riculum. Figure 13.10 shows a sample game, the answers to which are (1) transistors, (2) scanning tunneling microscopy, (3) metal crystals (tin, Sn), (4) optic ber, (5) magnetic storage media, (6) stress, (7) ATP , (8) com-posite volcano, (9) plant meristematic tissue, (10) about 4 hours, (11) below the picture, and (12) thermophilic bacteria. \u007f Figure 13.9 Extrapolation Exercise: The Compound Eye of a 5/9/08 6:09:12 Sourcebook for Teaching Science Teams: Divide the class into two or more teams, and select a captain for each.

After giving each team an equal and predeter-mined number of questions, the team with the highest score is declared the winner. 13.8 Twenty Questions A dichotomous key is a tool for classifying plants, animals, bacteria, fungi, protozoans, rocks, or other natural items or features. The trick is to ask dichotomous questions: questions in which there are only two possible responses. After answering a series of dichotomous questions, the object is \" keyed out \" or classi ed. Figure 13.11 illustrates a simpli ed dichotomous key for classifying the general appearance of plants. Twenty Questions is a classroom game, based on a popular radio and television game series, and spoken parlor game. It helps build keying skills and deductive reasoning. Taxonomists classify organisms according to common characteristics. Table 13.2 illustrates the classi cation of Magnolia grandifl ora, a broad- leaf tree native to the southeastern United States. Each level in the classi cation can be reached by asking speci c questions in a similar fashion to \u007f that illustrated above. It should be noted that the word endings (see portions ) are generally associ- ated with the level of classi cation. For example, Magnoli aceae can refer only to a family because of the - aceae suf x. Classi cation is extremely important in sci- ence, yet not all classi cation schemes are equally valuable. The popular game of Twenty Questions can provide an excellent introduction to the con-cept of dichotomous keying and illustrate the importance of asking good questions, and in a log-ical sequence, when developing a taxonomic key. ACTIVITY 13.8.1 Play Twenty Questions Tar ge t: The teacher writes a relevant concept, structure, process, or organism on an overhead \u007f 1. Are stems or other parts of the plant hard and woody? Yes...........go to 2No.............go to 3 2. Is the plant 3 meters tall or taller? Yes...........it is a TREENo.............it is a SHRUB 3. Does the plant have stems or leaves that are thick and moist with stored water? Yes...........it is a SUCCULENTNo.............go to 4 4. Is the plant growing above ground but supported by other plants with which it is intertwined? Yes...........it is a VINENo.............go to 5 5. Is the base of the leaf wrapped around the stem? Yes...........it is a GRASSNo.............it is a HERBtree shrub succulen t herb vine grass Figure 13.11 Dichotomous Key for the Physiognomy of PlansTable plants Family Magnoli acea e\u2014family for Magnolia- like plants Genus Magnolia \u2014genus includes all Species Magnolia grandifl ora\u2014speci The Sourcebook for Teaching Science transparency and covers it with a piece of paper. For example, in a biology class, a teacher might write a concept (Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium, cryptic coloration, founder effect), structure (lungs, alveoli, sternum), baleen whale, retrovirus). Questioning: Students try to determine what the teacher has written by asking yes or no questions. Since every question must be answered with a yes or no, students are effec-tively classifying the mystery item using a dichotomous key. Many students try to cir-cumvent the keying process and immediately guess a speci c item. Each time they do this, they waste a question, and since only 20 ques-tions are allowed, they decrease their chances of determining the unknown. Developing a dichotomous key: With time, students should learn that dichotomous keys work best when each question divides the remaining domain into two approxi-mately equal subdomains. If each question splits the remaining domain exactly in half, then the number of items that can be keyed out will increase as a power of 2. One dichot-omous question can key out two items (2 1 ), two questions can key out four items (2 2 ), three questions can key out eight items (2 3 ), and so on. Theoretically, one can key out 2 20 items (2 20 /H11005 1,048,576) with 20 dichotomous ques- tions. In reality, the number is much smaller because it is dif cult to divide the remaining domains exactly in half. Nonetheless, the proc-ess shows how the dichotomous key is a power-ful tool for classifying a large set of objects. Playing with multiple teams: Y ou may wish to separate the class into different teams and give each an identical series of terms to solve through the questioning process. Separate the groups suf ciently so they will not be able to hear the questioning process of the other groups. Select knowledgeable and impartial students to serve as game hosts, and appoint one to work with each team. T eam members should write down each question that is asked and its answer on a sheet of paper or their \u007f \u007f \u007fscience notebooks (see Chapter Three ). This becomes their dichotomous key for the mys-tery item. The game host reveals the mystery term only after the puzzle has been solved. The team that solves the puzzle with the fewest number of questions is declared the winner. ACTIVITY 13.8.2 Developing a Taxonomic Key Once students have learned the value of asking the right questions and sequencing them in a logi-cal fashion, give them the opportunity to develop a taxonomic scheme for a set of miscellaneous objects such as hardware (assorted nails, wash-ers, bolts, nuts, cotter pins, dowels) or desk items (assorted pens, pencils, paper clips, rubber bands, tacks). Give each group a jar containing a similar assortment of items, and ask them to develop a log-ical classi cation scheme. Students should draw a dichotomous decision tree (Figure 13.12 ) on a large sheet of paper. Each branch should be numbered and identi ed with a yes - no question. The objects should be placed on the appropriate branches and the key photographed and shared with the class. 13.9 Logic Games Numerous games can be used to introduce or rein- force scienti c principles and develop logical reason- ing. Many of these have been made into computer games and can be accessed or downloaded from +++ + +++ + + ++ + + ++ Figure 13.12 Template for a Learning Science 257 the Internet (see sciencesourcebook.com or search \" science shareware \" or \" logic games \" ). In this section we introduce Mastermind, Kakuro, Bridges, Sudoku, and Puzzle Loops. There are many other logic games that may be of use in building scienti c and spa- tial reasoning, including Othello , Gridlock, and Chess. All of these, and many more, may be found online. T eachers can model the problem - solving process by illustrating how these puzzles are solved. Games may be played for homework or extra credit. ACTIVITY 13.9.1 Mastermind (Code Brea ker) Many games have relevance to the science class-room even though they may not deal directly with science content. For example, logic games can be used to introduce scienti c reasoning. One such game is Mastermind (Figure 13.13 ), a computer game copied from the popular Milton Bradley board game by the same name. The objective in Mastermind is to guess a hidden code of four or more colors selected by the opponent (the com-puter in this case). Each time the player guesses a sequence of colors, the computer returns pegs. Each gray peg indicates that the guess includes a correct color in an incorrect location, and each black peg indicates that the guess includes a cor-rect color in a correct location. The position of the gray and black pegs is unrelated to the actual posi-tion within the code. Mastermind provides a great introduction to \" black box \" science in which scientists must use probes to measure an unseen object and can see the only response of probes since the object is too small or too dif cult to be seen. For example, Ernest Rutherford determined the basic structure of the atom through a classic black box experi-ment in which he shot alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold foil. Although he could not see the atoms in the foil, he concluded that they must be composed primarily of space since most of the alpha particles went straight through the opaque foil, while only a small percentage were refl ected or defl ected by particles within the foil. In the same way, students playing a strategy game like Mastermind must work with probes to determine a code that they are not allowed to see. The black and gray pegs returned by their oppo-nent (computer) are analogous to outputs from a probe, such as the defl ected or refl ected alpha particles in the Rutherford experiment, giving evi-dence of the hidden code or structure, and allow-ing the experimenter (student) to draw inferences about the unseen. In Mastermind, it may be neces-sary to discard an assumed sequence if it does not t the new data, just as a scientist must revise or discard previous hypotheses that don ' t t new data. Mastermind games can be downloaded from, or played on, the Internet (go to sciencesourcebook.com or search \" Mastermind \" or \" code - breaker game\").

Each horizontal or vertical block of digits must add up to the number given to the left or above, respectively. All the dig-its in each such block must be different. Numbers can be repeated on a line as long as they are in dif-ferent blocks. Figure 13.14 shows a Kakuro puzzle and its solution. Kakuro puzzles can be found on the Internet (go to sciencesourcebook.com or search \" Kakuro \" or \" cross sums \" ). ACTIVITY 13.9.3 Bridges: Hashiwokakero The circles in Figure 13.15 are \" islands, \" and the enclosed numbers are the quantity of \" bridges \" that touch each \" island. \" The goal is to connect all of the islands by drawing the speci ed number of \" bridges \" (lines). The bridges may run verti-cally or horizontally but not diagonally. No more than two bridges (double lines) can connect two islands. Solving a Hashiwokakero puzzle requires advanced planning and attention to procedure. Building a bridge often restricts the placement of subsequent bridges. Bridges puzzles can be found on the Internet (see sciencesourcebook.com or search \" bridges puzzle \" or \" Hashiwokakero \" ). ACTIVITY 13.9.4 Sudoku The objective in Sudoku is to complete the grid such that every row, column, and the nine 3 3 3 blocks con-tain the digits from 1 to 9, as illustrated in Figure 13.16 . Sudoku puzzles can be found on the Internet (see sciencesourcebook.com or search \" Sudoku \" ). ACTIVITY 13.9.5 Puzzle Loops The objective of Puzzle Loops is to make one continuous loop such that each number is bor-dered by the speci ed number of line segments, as shown in Figure 13.17 . Crossings, Ts, branches, and loose ends are not allowed. Each number indicates exactly how many lines should be drawn around it. Cells that do not have numbers inside can be surrounded by any number of lines.

Negative attitudes toward mathematics hinder learning and may limit students ' options in school and the workplace. Many students are dismayed when they learn that science classes require a knowledge of math, and it is not uncommon for teachers to hear students say, \" But I thought this was a science class, not a math class! \" when word problems are introduced. Unfortunately many mathphobic students develop a corresponding fear of science when word problems are introduced. Their fears are heightened by well - intentioned teachers who use phrases such as, \" It ' s easy, \" \" The answer is obvious, \" or \" It is intuitively clear, \" when illus-trating the solutions to word problems. T o students who find such tasks difficult, such statements only reinforce negative views of their own abilities. Although word problems may be easy for the teacher and some advanced students, they are not easy for most. It is unfortunate that students develop a dislike for word problems because these problems (also known as story problems) are at the heart of scienti c problem solving. In the real world, problems do not show up in symbolic or arithmetic form. Rather, they must be translated from natural language into mathematical symbols to be solved. Solving word problems is often a complex activity requiring the integration of numerous concepts, facts, and strategies. Unlike symbolic arithmetic problems that are highly standardized and require uniform application of speci c algo- rithms, word problems are highly variable and can often be solved in a variety of ways. Despite this variability, a task analysis of expert problem solvers reveals similarities in their approaches. This chapter introduces a few of these common strategies related to problem translation, and the c14.indd 261 c14.indd 261 5/9/08 4:56:48 PM 5/9/08 4:56:48 PM262 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Table 14.1 shows words that generally imply spe- ci c mathematical operations, and you may wish to provide your students with a copy of this list to assist them in decoding word problems. Context affects the meaning of words, and it is important to understand this when translating word prob-lems. For example, to \" take 40 percent of some-thing \" means to multiply by 0.40. However, to calculate the percentage of something means to divide a part by the whole and multiply by 100 percent. Similarly, the term increase gener- ally implies addition (e.g., the value increased by 5; x /H11001 5) but can imply multiplication in other phrases (e.g., the product increased by a factor of following chapters discuss a number of additional strategies, including dimensional analysis. Translation is one of the most dif cult aspects of solving word problems, but it is also the most important; without it, no one can use mathematics to solve any real - world problems. In natural lan-guage, learners rst learn how to recognize terms, then phrases, and nally sentences. In developing mastery of word problems, the approach is simi-lar. Students rst learn vocabulary (Chapter One ) before they can decode phrases and ultimately make sense of sentences. The English language is exceedingly complex, and there are many words for the same concept.

For example, twice indicates a multiplication by two. c14.indd 262 c14.indd 262 Problems 263 ve: 5 x ). When reviewing Table 14.1 with your students, show them that some terms refer to spe-ci c types of a particular operation. For example, the inverse of a number is simply the quotient of 1 and that number. Y ou may want to make a large poster of Table 14.1 , and place it on the bulletin board for students to reference. Some students will experience anxiety when exposed to the problems in this part of the book. Remind your students that these exercises focus on aspects of translation and do not require knowl-edge of the underlying scienti c principles. It is bene cial to work through sample problems with your students so that they can see that the strate-gies they are learning are universal and will be of help whenever they face word problems, particu-larly when they are unfamiliar with the underlying scienti c principles. 14.1 Translating Common Words into Mathematical Symbols One of the greatest challenges in working with science word problems is translating them into symbolic form. The lists that follow include a variety of words often found in science word problems. Identify each of the terms as equal (=), or parentheses ( ) by placing the appropriate symbol after the term. Some terms may imply a speci c type of the process. For example, triple implies \" multiplication by three, \" not just \" mul-tiplication. \" Other terms have different mean-ings depending on the way in which the sentence is written. For example, if the problem says to \" calculate percent, \" then division of the part by the whole and multiplication by 100 is implied, while if the problem says to \" take the percent of something, \" then multiplication by a decimal is implied. Always look at the context when interpreting a word problem, as there is not always a one - to - one correspondence between math words and symbols. The following activities use the most common meaning of the word. Figure 14.1 shows how the Ideal Gas Law can be mapped from nat-ural language to symbolic form. Note how much simpler the symbolic form is than the natural lan-guage form. ACTIVITY 14.1.1 Translating Words into Math ematics Symbols: Part 1 Translate each of the following words into its most likely mathematical meaning, and indicate with the appropriate unknown (?), equal (=), or parentheses ( ). add addition all also amounts to and answer are b e b y by a factor of combined cubed cut d e b t decreased by deduct d e l e t e difference of diminish distributed over d i v i d e double each each equals exceeds exponent fold gives grouped half of how far? how many? how much? including increased by increment i n t o is less lose minus more more than multiply n e g a t i v e o f The product of pressure and volume equals the product of the number of moles , the gas constant and temperature PV = nRTPV = nR T Figure 14.1 Mapping the Ideal Gas Law from Natural Language to Mathematical Symbols c14.indd 263 c14.indd 263 5/9/08 4:56:49 PM Sourcebook Teaching Science ACTIVITY 14.1.2 Translating Words into Mathematics Symbols: Part 2 Translate each of the following words into its most likely mathematical meaning and indicate with the appropriate unknown (?), equal (=), or parentheses ( ). in 60 seconds, we substitute values into the alge- braic expression and then perform the arithmetic: c t/H11005/H11003 /H1100530 1 0 68.( ) m/s speed of light in a vacuum 00 3 0 10 60 1 8 1081 0st i m e m/s m() /H11005/H11005 /H11003 ( ) We same algebraic expression to solve related arithmetic problems. For example, to determine the distance light will travel in 2 sec-onds, we substitute the new value for t ( t = 60 s) into the algebraic expression and again perform the arithmetic. c t/H11005/H11003 /H1100530 1 0 28.( ) m/s speed of light in a vacuum sst i m e m/s s m() ..dc t dc t/H11005 /H11005/H11005 /H11003 /H11005 ) Algebra simpli es problem solving by provid- ing general relationships in a simpli ed manner. For example, the equation dc t/H11005 is a simpli ed way of stating that \" the distance light travels in a year is the product of the speed of light in a vacuum and the elapsed time. \" Algebra is an indispensable tool for prob- lem solving in science, and although algebraic expressions are simplified expressions of natu-ral language, the process to convert natural lan-guage to algebraic expressions is not so simple. Figure 14.2 shows how natural language can be mapped to mathematical symbols. Note how much simpler the symbolic form is. T o become a good problem solver, one must learn how to translate verbal descriptions into algebraic expressions. The following activities provide practice translating phrases into algebraic expressions. The better students become at translating phrases in algebraic expressions, the better they will be at solving word problems.

Algebra simpli es problem solving by providing a pattern that can be fol-lowed for an unlimited number of related arith-metic calculations. For example, the distance that light travels through space in a given period can be represented by the algebraic relationship: dc t/H11005 where d = distance , c = speed of light in a vacuum, and t = time. This relationship holds true regardless of the time period involved. The calculation of speci c distances involves substitution of speci c values. For example, to calculate the distance light travels c14.indd 264 c14.indd 264 5/9/08 4:56:51 PM 5/9/08 Natural Lan- guage with Algebraic Expressions: Part 1 Read the phrase on the left, and then match it with the corresponding algebraic expression on the right.

Wo r k ( W ) is the product of the force ( F ) and the distance ( d ) through which the force is applied. 2.

The nal velocity ( v f ) is equal to the sum of the initial velocity ( v i ) and the product of acceleration ( a ) and the difference in time ( t ). 6. Pressure ( P ) is the ratio of force ( F ) to area ( A ). 7. The ratio of the height ( h i ) of an image to the height of its object ( h o ) is equal to the ratio of the distance from the lens to the image ( d i ) and the distance from the lens to the object ( d o ). 8. The change in Gibbs free energy ( G ) is equal to the change in enthalpy ( H ) minus the prod- uct of the temperature ( T ) and the change in entropy ( S ). 9. The force between two point charges ( F ) is equal to the product of a proportionality con-stant ( k ) and the two charges ( Q 1 , Q 2 ) divided by the square of the distance ( d ) between them. 10. The energy of a photon ( E p ) is equal to the product of Planck ' s constant ( h ) and the fre- quency ( f ) . 14.3 Translating Algebraic Expressions into Natural Language The ancient Egyptians wrote in hieroglyphics, pic- torial symbols illustrated in the Papyrus of Ani (Figure 14.3 ). Can you interpret what is written on the papyrus? Well, neither can I! The problem is that we lack an interpreter. Fortunately, there are Egyptologists who have deciphered the ancient code and can translate such writings into English, but I certainly am not one of them! Unfortunately, many of us look at the equations in a science book and see hieroglyph-ics! Look at the equations listed below. Perhaps these look as confusing as what is written on the Papyrus of Ani. Fortunately, however, we can learn to interpret such equations and the properties they represent. All of the equations listed below are algebraic expressions involving addition, subtrac-tion, multiplication, division, powers, and/or roots. The problem is that the variable names are not the same as the a, b, c or x, y, z found in traditional algebra books with which you may be familiar. When given the equation PV = nRT, and asked to solve for P, many students are stumped, but if they are given the equation ab = cde and asked to solve for a, they can readily do so. The problem is that most are familiar with the algebraic vari-able names a, b, c, d, and e, but not with P, V , n, R, and T. But although the symbols are different, the principles and operations are the same. Translators are fl uent in translating ideas between languages. To b e fl uent in science requires the ability to trans- late concepts from natural language into algebraic expressions and translate algebraic expressions into natural language. This activity focuses on the second skill: trans- lating algebraic expressions into natural language. For example, the equation d = ct (where d is The Papyrus of Ani - (public domain image) Figure 14.3 Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphics c14.indd 266 c14.indd 266 5/9/08 4:56:53 PM 5/9/08 4:56:53 PMScience Word Problems 267 distance, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and t is time) can be expressed in natural language as fol-lows: The distance light travels in a vacuum is equal to the product of the speed of light and the elapsed time. ACTIVITY 14.3.1 Translating Algebraic Expressions into Natural Language This activity is designed to provide practice trans-lating relationships from algebra to natural lan-guage. Y ou need not be familiar with any of the following equations, but you will need to make logical inferences when translating them. Don ' t panic if these equations are new to you. The algebraic prin-ciples are the same even though the scienti c princi- ples vary. For each equation, there are two statements in natural language: one is correct, and the other is incorrect. Interpret the algebraic expressions, make logical inferences about variable names, and circle the correct statements. In most instances variable sym-bols are the rst letters of the variables they represent. 1 avv ttavfi fi/H11005/H11002 /H11002 (a) As the difference in velocity between nal and initial times increases, accel- eration decreases.

As a result, many mathematics teachers are not prepared to discuss the scienti c applica- tion of mathematical principles, and their students learn mathematics apart from its scienti c appli- cations. T o compound the problem, many science teachers avoid using mathematics because of their own insecurities with math or because their stu-dents lack suf cient mathematical skills. If math teachers do not incorporate science problems and science teachers avoid problems requiring math, students will fail to see the rel-evance of math to science, and vice versa. When students fail to integrate math and science con-cepts, both their understanding and abilities will be severely limited. We encourage math teachers to talk about the scienti c origins and applications of mathematics, and science teachers to incorpo-rate mathematics as a tool for teaching and under-standing science. The histories of mathematics and science are tightly interwoven. Scienti c problems have led to major advances in mathematics, and the develop-ment of new techniques in mathematics has led to the foundation of new branches in science. Recent archeological nds have shown that people liv- ing as early as 3000 b.c. made use of mathemati- cal rules to survey land, construct buildings, and measure storage containers. In the sixth century b.c., the Greeks gathered and extended this prac- tical knowledge in a subject now known as geom- etry, a word derived from the Greek words geo ( \" Earth \" ) and metron ( \" measure \" ). Geometry is often taught as an abstract body of knowledge, but it had its origins in the practical measurements c15.indd 270 c15.indd 270 5/9/08 11:32:09 AM 5/9/08 11:32:09 AMGeometric Principles in Science 271 calculus, a branch of mathematics that subse- quently revolutionized virtually every science by providing tools to deal with rates of change for continuous functions. More recently mathematician Hermann Minkowski contributed the notion of the space - time continuum, with time as the fourth dimen-sion, a concept essential to the development of Einstein ' s theory of relativity, and mathematician John von Neumann developed a branch of alge-bra that has been an invaluable tool in the devel-opment of quantum mechanics. T oday the new frontiers of science are increasingly dependent on mathematics, and the push for mathematics research is made by scientists who need new tools to solve their problems. Although all branches of mathematics have application in science, we focus on geometry and trigonometry in this chapter. Both of these elds involve graphic representations that can be used to help visualize and solve real - world problems. Although you may initially encounter resistance from your students as you emphasize mathemati-cal applications in science class, we encourage you to stay the course and show students how math is a tool that simpli es, rather than complicates, sci- ence. Mathematical equations and geometric rela-tions are simpli ed representations of scienti c problems, and students who understand this will be better prepared to understand the underlying principles. 15.1 Developing Measurement Scales On August 10, 1519, the Portuguese naviga- tor Ferdinand Magellan embarked with a fl eet of ve ships and 230 men with a goal to be the rst to sail around the world. Magellan and his crew became the rst to sail past the southern tip of South America and the rst to cross the Paci c Ocean, but Magellan was later killed by natives in the Philippines. The Basque navigator Viscaya Guetaria assumed leadership, and in September 1522, he returned home with just one ship and necessary for commerce. Similarly, other branches of mathematics had their origin in scienti c or practical problems. It is helpful to review the his-tory of science and mathematics to illustrate why it is important to teach math with a view toward scienti c applications and science with an applica- tion of mathematical principles. Have you ever wondered why there are 360 degrees in a circle rather than 100, or 60 minutes in an hour rather than 10? Wouldn ' t it be more consistent to have 10 seconds in a minute, 10 min-utes in an hour, and 10 hours in a day? We owe our odd measures of direction and time to the ancient Babylonians, who used a base 60 system rather than the base 10 system with which we are familiar. In their early work in astronomy, the Babylonians divided a circle into 360 parts so they could chart celestial bodies and predict the daily positions of the planets. Similarly, ancient Egyptians used geo-metric principles to calculate the areas of elds, the volumes of granaries, and the numbers of bricks for proposed buildings. These ancient peo-ples gave us accurate and consistent measurement systems, an essential element in the development of empirical research. In the sixth century b.c., the Greek mathema- ticians Thales of Milets and Pythagoras of S \u00e1 mos developed a system of deductive geometric proofs. Their systems of deductive proof laid the founda-tion for deductive reasoning, a key tool in scien-ti c problem solving. Using deduction, the early Greek geometer Eratosthenes accurately estimated the circumference of the earth in the third century b.c. Archimedes, another great Greek mathemati- cian and scientist, produced theorems to calculate complex volumes and employed such calculations in his studies on buoyancy. Later the Greek astron-omer Hipparchus developed Tables of trigonomet-ric ratios, which he used to determine distances between cities, the circumference of the Earth, and the distance to the Moon. The seventeenth - century founders of modern science, Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, made huge strides in astronomy and optics as they sought to nd mathematical laws in the natural world. T o deal with previously insoluble problems in astronomy and motion, Sir Isaac Newton invented c15.indd 271 c15.indd 271 5/9/08 11:32:11 AM 5/9/08 11:32:11 AM272 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science only 18 of the original crew. The Magellan/ Guetaria voyage was a grueling adventure with sig-ni cant loss of life, but it opened the way for fur- ther exploration, communication, and commerce. In addition to nally proving that the world was spherical, a notion proposed centuries before by ancient mathematicians and geographers (see section 15.3), the crew charted new lands and seas. Although crude by modern mapmaking standards, the Magellan/Guetaria maps were drawn to scale and thereby allowed later navigators to estimate distances between ports. T oday, with the help of satellite - based global positioning systems (GPS), maps are drawn to precise scale, allowing motorists, sailors, pilots, and hikers to accurately calculate distances. Scientists make use of scales when drawing or interpreting diagrams and photographs. For example, a radiologist may determine the length of a fracture by applying a scale to an X - ray of a bone, and a geneticist may determine the distance between two genes by applying a scale to the chro-mosome. In the following activities, students asked to develop scales to determine distances. ACTIVITY 15.1.1 Developing Measurement Scales The map provided in Figure 15.1A shows a hypo-thetical lunar landing site and four experimental research sites. Table 15.1 includes only the dis-tance between the landing site (1) and a research site (2). Use this information to develop a scale for the map by dividing the real distance (measured in kilometers) by the map distance (measured in millimeters). This ratio is your scale. Include this value in Table 15.1 , and use it to estimate the dis-tance between the research station (point 1) and the other research sites (points 3, 4, and 5). 21 345 12 3 4 5 A BC3 425 1 Figure 15.1 Developing Scales of Measurement for (A) the Moon, (B) a Dicot Stem, and (C) the Brain NASA.

How can such dis- tances be measured? There is no tape long enough to measure astronomical distances or any scale pre-cise enough to measure bond lengths. Although it is impossible to directly measure such distances, it is possible to determine them indirectly by com- paring them with distances that can be measured. For example, if a skyscraper casts a shadow 50 times as far as an adjacent house of known height, we can assume that it is 50 times as tall, even though we have not made a direct measurement of its height. Scientists determine many values indirectly. ACTIVITY 15.2.1 Direct and Indirect Mea surements The following is a list of unusual facts, some of which were determined by direct measurement and others by indirect measurement. Identify those that must have been made indirectly because they could not have been measured directly. 1. The average surface temperature of Mars is 210 K. 2. The wingspan of a Boeing 747 - 400 jetliner (231.85 ft) is greater than the distance of the Wright brother ' s rst fl ight (120 ft). 3. Bamboo can grow up to 36 in. in a day. 4. A fl ea can jump 350 times its own body length. 5. The length of a carbon - aluminum bond is double the distance of a carbon - hydrogen bond. 6. Fingernails grow nearly four times faster than toenails. 7. Rain falls at 11 km per hour (7 mph). 8. The oldest living plants, bristlecone pines, are approximately 4600 years old. 9. Beans and pepper were cultivated in Peru starting about 6000 b.c. 10. The Sun is composed of 91.2 percent hydro- gen, 8.7 percent helium, and 0.1 percent other elements. 11. The mass of the Moon is 7 /H11003 10 22 kg. 12. The highest recorded \" sneeze speed \" is 165 km per hour. 13. The surface temperature of Pluto is 40 K. 14. In 2000, Americans ate an average of 18 acres of pizza every day. 15. An ant can survive up to 2 days underwater. ACTIVITY 15.2.2 Determining the Diameter of the Moon by Indirect Measurement Astronomers have estimated the average distance from the surface of the Earth to the Moon to be 385,000 km. Given this value, we can calculate its diameter. With a partner, take turns holding a washer of any size at arm ' s length (Figure 15.2 ). Sight the Moon with one eye, keeping the other closed, such that the Moon is visible in the center of the washer hole. Slowly bring the washer closer until the Moon ' s circular surface appears to just touch the inside rim of the washer. Y our partner should measure the distance between the washer and your eye. The triangle formed by the diam-eter of the Moon and the distance to the Moon is a similar triangle to that formed by the diameter of the washer hole and the distance to the washer hole so that the following ratio holds: diameter of Moon to Moondiameter of washer hole distance di/H11005sstance fromeye towasher Moon distance to Moondiamete r of Moonwasher distance to washerdiameter of hole 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10cm Figure 15.2 Estimating the Diameter of the Moon c15.indd 273 c15.indd 273 5/9/08 11:32:12 AM 5/9/08 11:32:12 AM274 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Once you have made these measurements, convert them to kilometers (100,000 cm /H11005 1 km), and calculate the diameter of the Moon: diameter of Moon /H11005 (, )385000 kmdiameter of washer hole dis ce fromeyetowasher/H11003 tan According to your calculations, what is the diameter of the Moon? Look up the accepted value and determine the percent error between your cal-culated value (observed) and the accepted value. Percent error is de ned as: percent errorobserved accepted accepted/H11005/H11003()%100 ACTIVITY 15.2.3 Determining Height by Indirect Measurement The tallest mountain in the world is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Nepal (8849 m). Mount Everest was determined to be the highest point on Earth in 1856 by a British survey team and was named in honor of the man who had led the survey team from 1830 to 1843. The British survey team never climbed Everest but determined its height indirectly using ratios and other math-ematics principles. In this activity, you will employ some of the same principles to determine the height of a tall tree (you can do this same activity with a build-ing or other structure). Place a rod in the soil such that the shadow cast by the rod falls to the same point as the shadow cast by the tall object (Figure 15.3 ). Measure the height of the rod, the length of the rod ' s shadow, and the length of the tree or building ' s shadow. The triangle formed by the tree or building and its shadow is similar to the tri-angle formed by the rod and its shadow. In other words, the ratio of the tree (or building) height to the length of its shadow is identical to the ratio of the rod ' s height to the length of the rod ' s shadow. Stated in equation form: height of tree lengthof tree shadowheight of rod lengthof rod shado/H11005ww Solving for the unknown height of the tree, we have: height of tree lengthof tree shadow /H11005() /H11003 height of rod lengthof rod shadow According to your calculations, what is the height of the tree (or building)? ACTIVITY 15.2.4 Determining the Thickness of a Sheet of Paper The preceding activities used ratios to measure objects too large to measure directly. In this activity, you will use indirect measurement to measure things too small to measure directly (Figure 15.4 ). The thickness of a piece of paper is too small to measure with a ruler, but it can be determined indirectly. length of tree shadowstick shadowheight of tree height of stick Figure 15.3 Determining the Height of a Tree 0123 4 5thickness of x pages x pages long1 pagethickness of one page Figure 15.4 Determining the Thickness of a Page c15.indd 274 c15.indd 274 5/9/08 11:32:13 AM 5/9/08 11:32:13 AMGeometric Principles in Science 275 Open a book, and determine the number of pages by adding the numbered pages with the intro-ductory and closing pages.

Divide this distance by the number of sheets to determine the thickness of a sheet of paper: thickness of a sheetthicknessof all sheets number of sheets/H11005 15.3 Ratios for Solving Problems in Science Mathematics has been an essential tool to scientists throughout the ages. In 240 b.c. the Greek mathe- matician, geographer, and astronomer Eratosthenes became the rst to accurately estimate the circum- ference of the Earth. Obviously Eratosthenes could not directly measure the Earth ' s circumference, so he used some basic mathematics principles to arrive at a reasonable estimate. Eratosthenes knew that the summer solstice (June 20 - 21) is the longest day of the year. He noted that at noon on this day, the Sun cast no shadows in the city of Syene, Egypt. On another summer solstice, Eratosthenes noticed that the Sun cast a shadow of 7.2 degrees in Alexandria, a city 800 km (497 mi) north of Syene. He reasoned that the difference in the angles of the shadows was a result of a difference in the positions of the two cities on the surface of a spherical earth (Figure 15.5 ) and that a 7.2 degree difference indicated that Alexandria was 7.2 degrees (out of a 360 degree circle) north of Syene. Eratosthenes con-cluded that the distance from Syene to Alexandria represented 2 percent (7.2 \u00b0 /360 \u00b0 ) of the circum-ference of the Earth. He then set up the following ratio to determine the Earth ' s circumference: angle around Earth anglebetweencities circumferen/H11005 /H11005 /H11005360 Earthdis cebetweencities /H11005 /H11005/H1100550 50 800() ()tan km 40 000,k m ACTIVITY 15.3.1 Calculating the Circum- ference of the Earth In this activity, you will calculate the circumference of the Earth using Eratosthenes ' technique. This is best done on either the winter or summer solstices (December 21 - 22, June 20 - 21) or the spring or fall equinoxes (March 20 - 21 or September 22 - 23). The Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees, and on the win-ter equinox it is positioned such that the Sun is at its lowest point above the horizon as viewed from northern latitudes, but directly overhead when viewed form the Tropic of Capricorn, an imaginary line around the globe at 23.5 degrees south latitude (Figure 15.6 ). On June 21, the Earth is positioned so that the Sun appears directly overhead at noon along the Tropic of Cancer, an imaginary band circling the Earth at 23.5 degrees north latitude. On the fall and spring equinoxes, the Sun appears directly overhead at noon along the equator. This activity should be performed at noon on or close to one of the equinoxes or solstices. Data for a few major cities appear in Table 15.2 , and data for hundreds more can be found online at sciencesourcebook.org . Pound a pole into the ground, and check to make sure it is vertical using a carpenter ' s level. At solar noon on the selected day (when the shadow points directly north), record the length of the Figure 15.5 Calculating Earth's Circumference Syene xSun AM276 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Table 15.2 Distance (km) North of Key Latitude (Tropics of Capricorn or Cancer, and Equator) on Winter (W) and Summer (Su) Solstices, and the Spring and Fall Equinoxes (S, F) Where the Sun Is Directly Overhead on the Solstices and EquinoxesTropic of CapricornTropic 20-21 or September 22-23 shadow and the length of the pole, and calculate the angle of the shadow by taking arc tangent (tan /H11002 1 ) of the ratio of these values (Figure 15.7 ): tan/H11002/H110051lengthof shadow lengthof poleshadow angle Determine the distance to the key latitude for the day on which you make your measure-ments.

Plants produce the food and oxygen we need through a process known as pho- tosynthesis. Approximately one - third of the world ' s oxygen production comes from microscopic algae known as phytoplankton that live in the surface waters of the world ' s oceans. These phytoplank-ton must be near the surface, where light inten-sity is great enough for photosynthesis to occur. Ironically, phytoplankton are considerably denser than water, so what keeps these tiny plants near the surface where they can capture light and pro-duce the oxygen we breathe? The force of gravity is proportional to an object ' s mass ( F /H11005 mg ), while drag (resistance to sinking) is proportional to its surface area. Given constant density, the mass of an object is directly proportional to its volume. If an object has a low surface area to volume ratio, then the force of grav-ity acting on it may exceed the drag, causing it to sink. If, however, the surface area to volume ratio is high, the forces may balance, preventing sinking. Phytoplankton remain suspended in the upper layers of the ocean because they have very high surface area to volume ratios. Figure 15.8 shows that most have projections that dramati-cally increase surface area. Would phytoplankton stay suspended or sink if they were scaled up in length of shadow length of pole 10 020304050607080 90 100110 120 130 140 150 160 170 18090 8070 60 50 40 30 20 10 0100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180Sun Sun Figure 15.7 Determining the Angle of the Shadow of the Sun Figure 15.8 Phytoplankton c15.indd 277 Sourcebook for Teaching Science size? In other words, would they stay suspended if they were macroscopic (large enough to be seen without a microscope)? In this activity, you will investigate how the surface area to volume ratio of an object changes as a function of its size and why the small size of plankton is important to their survival, and to ours! Phytoplankton have diverse and complex shapes, which makes calculations of surface area and vol-ume dif cult, so to simplify matters, we will inves- tigate the relationship between surface area and volume using simpler shapes: cubes and spheres. ACTIVITY 15.4.1 Surface Area to Volume Ratios in Cubes and Spheres How does a change in the linear dimension of a cube affect its surface area and volume? Using sugar cubes, construct the series of compos-ite cubes shown in Figure 15.9 . For each cube constructed, measure the length of a side, com-pute the surface area and the volume, and write your answers in a data table such as illustrated in Table 15.3 . In addition, determine the mass of each object using a scale or balance. Y ou may wish to stack the cubes directly on the bal-ance, or glue them together with white glue and place them on the balance when you are done. Use your measurements and calculations to compute the ratios of length to volume, mass to volume, and surface area to volume. Prepare sepa-rate plots of the following (1) length/volume ver-sus length, (2) surface area/mass versus length, and (3) surface area/volume versus length. Although it is easy to directly measure the dimensions of a cube, it is not so easy to directly measure the dimensions of a sphere, much less irregular shapes such as phytoplankton. In the natural world, many things, such as water droplets and soap bubbles, assume a spherical shape. T o see if the relationships between surface area and vol-ume hold true for spheres, perform the calcula-tions speci ed in Table 15.4 . 1. As a cube increases in size, does the ratio of surface area to volume increase or decrease? 2. As the cube grows larger, does the ratio of surface area to mass increase or decrease? 3. Do these relationships hold true for spheres as well? Explain your answer. 4. Phytoplankton are very small and often con- tain numerous spines (Figure 15.8 ). Explain how these features help keep them near the surface, where they can receive suf cient light to conduct photosynthesis.

In animals, heat production is proportional to mass, while heat loss is proportional to surface area. If all other factors are equal, will a baby or an adult be more susceptible to getting chilled? 6. If the amount of heat lost through the skin of an animal is directly proportional to its sur-face area, what might you conclude about the relative heat loss of a very small animal com-pared to a very large animal? Which size ani-mal would nd it easier to keep warm in the winter, and which animal would nd it easier to keep cool in the summer? 15.5 Surface Area to Volume Ratios in Living Systems The idea of giants and dwarfs has fascinated authors and moviemakers through the years. In 1726, the British author Jonathan Swift wrote his classic work, Gulliver ' s Travels. Although written as a political satire, the book became enshrined in adolescent literature for its fanciful depictions of a man held hostage by people only 6 in. (15 cm) tall. In 1865, Lewis Carroll wrote Alice in Wonderland, an imaginative children ' s story in which a little girl grew to gigantic size and then shrank to a fraction of her original height after following a white rab-bit into a dreamlike world. In 1933, RKO Radio Pictures released King Kong, the classic tale of a giant gorilla that terrorized New Y ork City. The theme of abnormally large and small creatures has continued to be popular in books and mov-ies. Giants and dwarfs make great science ction, but a look at the principles of geometry and their applications to science shows why such stories can indeed be science ction. Movie a cionados estimate that the giant ape in the original King Kong movie was 150 ft tall, and therefore a 30 times enlargement of a stand-ard 5 ft tall ape. Could such a gigantic creature stand on its feet or cling to a skyscraper? A geo-metric analysis will help in the investigation. The strengths of animal bones are proportional to their cross - sectional areas. If King Kong were a 30 times enlargement of an ape, then the cross - sectional radii of his bones would have been 30 times larger and their cross - sectional areas 900 times greater (A /H11005 /H9266 r 2 ). Since strength is proportional to cross - sectional area, the bones of King Kong would have been approximately 900 times stronger than those of the standard ape. Although the strength of King Kong ' s bones would have been proportional to the cross - sectional area of his bones, his body weight would have been proportional to his vol-ume. In Activity 15.4.1 we learned that the volume of a sphere increases as the cube of its radius ( v /H11005 (4/3) /H9266 r 3 ) and the volume of a cube increases as the cube of its length ( v /H11005 l 3 ). Although the shape of an ape is more com- plex than a sphere or cube, its body volume also increases as approximately the cube of its linear dimensions. If an ape is scaled up 30 times to the height of King Kong, then its volume is scaled up as a function of the cube of his height (30 3 /H11005 27,000 /H11003 ). Thus, although King Kong ' s bones would have been approximately 900 times stronger than a standard ape ' s bones, his volume, and thus his mass, would have been nearly 27,000 times greater! By scaling an ape up 30 times to King Kong ' s size, the strength to weight ratio decreases to only 3 percent of its original value (900/27,000 /H11005 0.03). As a result, King Kong ' s bones would have collapsed under his massive weight, and he could never have walked, much less climbed, the Empire State Building. Y ou might wonder how a tiger can support its weight since it appears to be a scaled - up version of a house cat. (The apparent similarity between house cats and tigers has led to \" Tiger \" being the most popular name given to house cats.) If you com-pare the dimensions of tigers with house cats, you will notice that tigers are not a scaled - up model of house cats. The leg bones of tigers are proportion-ately wider than what would be expected by simply scaling up. Tigers must have proportionately wider bones than house cats in order to support their dis-proportionately greater weight. Moviemakers gen-erally don ' t take these principles into account when creating movies. For example, the gigantic spider in the movie classic The Lord of the Rings appears thousands of times the size of a normal spider but c15.indd 279 c15.indd 279 5/9/08 11:32:19 AM 5/9/08 11:32:19 AM280 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science could never survive in the real world because its legs would be crushed under its own weight. The cross - sectional area of its legs would be insuf cient to support its enormous weight. Surface area to volume ratio is indeed one of the most important geometric principles in science. Many biological functions are determined or regulated by surface area and others by vol-ume, so the surface area to volume ratio often dic-tates what an organism can and can ' t do. One of the rst biologists to examine the importance of size and surface area to volume ratio was J.B.S. Haldane, who in 1928 published an often quoted essay, \" On Being the Right Size. \" 1 In this essay, Haldane discussed the importance of size: T o the mouse and any smaller animal it [grav- ity] presents practically no dangers. Y ou can drop a mouse down a thousand - yard mine shaft; and, on arriving at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided that the ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, a horse splashes. For the resistance presented to movement by the air is propor-tional to the surface of the moving object. Divide an animal ' s length, breadth, and height each by ten; its weight is reduced to a thou-sandth, but its surface only to a hundredth. So the resistance to falling in the case of the small animal is relatively ten times greater than the driving force. An insect, therefore, is not afraid of grav- ity; it can fall without danger, and can cling to the ceiling with remarkably little trouble. It can go in for elegant and fantastic forms of sup-port like that of the daddy - longlegs. But there is a force which is as formidable to an insect as gravitation to a mammal. This is surface tension. A man coming out of a bath carries with him a lm of water of about one - ftieth of an inch in thickness. This weighs roughly a pound. A wet mouse has to carry about its own weight of water. A wet fl y has to lift many times its own weight and, as everyone knows, a fl y once wetted by water or any other liquid is in a very serious position indeed. An insect going for a drink is in as great danger as a man leaning out over a precipice in search of food. If it once falls into the grip of the surface ten-sion of the water \u2014 that is to say, gets wet \u2014 it is likely to remain so until it drowns. A few insects, such as water - beetles, contrive to be unwettable; the majority keep well away from their drink by means of a long proboscis. Consider another issue relating to scale. \" Warm - blooded \" animals lose heat primarily through their external surfaces, and it can be shown that the rate of heat loss is proportional to surface area, all other factors being constant. Since food provides the energy necessary for an animal to keep warm and mobile, food requirements for heat balance are proportional to surface area. Consequently, smaller animals, with their greater surface area to weight ratios, require proportionally more food to survive. The Lilliputians in Gulliver ' s Travels are approxi- mately one - tenth the height of Gulliver and would therefore require a volume of food approximately 1/100 as great as Gulliver, even though they have only 1/1000 his weight. Hence, proportionate to their body size, the Lilliputians would have to eat 10 times as much food as Gulliver. T o do this, the Lilliputians would spend much of their time eat-ing, which is what hummingbirds and other small warm - blooded animals do. The most signi cant thing about scaling up or down in size is the resulting change in the ratios between length, area, and volume. If a cubic object doubles in length ( l ) its area ( l 2 ) quadruples and its volume ( l 3 ) increases by a factor of 8. This has a host of effects on living and nonliving systems, one of which is heat transfer. If a person were to be scaled up two times so his or her new height, h, was two times as great as the original, his or her sur-face area would increase by a factor of 4 ( h 2 /H11005 4), while his or her volume would increase by a factor of 8 ( h 3 /H11005 8). Features dependent on surface area, such as heat transfer, would increase by a factor of approximately 4, while factors dependent on vol-ume, such as heat production, would increase by a factor of approximately 8. Thus, the person who was scaled up two times would generate heat faster than he or she could release it and would probably overheat. By contrast, if a person is scaled down c15.indd 280 c15.indd 280 5/9/08 11:32:20 AM 5/9/08 11:32:20 AMGeometric Principles in Science 281 to one - half his or her original size ( h /H11005 1/2), his or her surface area would decrease to one - fourth ( h 2 /H11005 1/4) while his or her volume and mass would decrease to one - eighth ( h 3 /H11005 1/8) of the original values. Although such a person would lose heat only one - fourth as fast, he or she would pro-duce it only one - eighth as fast and therefore would get cold faster. (Y oung animals are not scale mod-els of older animals, and shorter people are not scale models of taller people. When we refer to scaling, we refer to multiplying all dimensions by the same factor, which is not what occurs during normal growth and development.) ACTIVITY 15.5.1 Characteristics of Large and Small Animals Although large animals are not scale models of small ones, there is a tendency for larger animals to have a small surface area to volume ratio and small animals to have a large surface area to vol-ume ratio. Examine each of the statements in Table 15.5 , and determine if it is a characteristic of large (L) or small (S) animals. ACTIVITY 15.5.2 Calculating Your Personal Surface Area to Volume Ratio What is your personal surface area to volume ratio? How does it compare to classmates who are taller or shorter than you? Although it is dif- cult to directly measure the surface area or the volume of a human body, it is relatively easy to estimate. The surface area of your body is roughly 100 times as great as the surface area of your handprint. Measure the surface area of your hand by drawing an outline on a sheet of graph paper and counting the number of cells covered by your hand, not including your wrist (Figure 15.10A ). Multiply this number by the area of a single square to estimate the surface area of your hand, then by 100 to obtain a rough estimate of the surface area of your body. A more accurate estimate of your surface area can be derived from the nomograph in Figure 15.10B , or by solving for SA in the for- mula: lnSA /H11005 a 0 /H11001 a 1 ln H /H11001 n a 2 ln W, in which a 0 /H11005 /H11002 3751, a 1 /H11005 0422, 0515 if height ( H ) is Table 15.5 Identify as a Characteristic of Large (L) or Small (S) Animals 1 Gravity is frequently a dangerous force. 2 Electrostatic charge can be a dangerous force. 3 Getting wet can be dangerous because proportionately greater weight is carried. 4 The heart has to service proportionately more body mass, so it must work harder. 5 It is dif cult to do a somersault. 6 Keeping cool is a bigger problem than keeping warm. 7 They may \"shut down\" when they can't stay warm. 8 They can jump proportionately farther and move proportionately faster. 9 They can live in colder climates because they hold their heat better. 10 They can run up trees and may hang on glass or from a smooth ceiling. 11 They can take a water bath to cool off.12 They carry proportionately less weight and lose proportionately more body heat. 13 They have proportionately little water reserve.14 They lose heat quickly, so they have to eat fre- quently to stay warm. 15 They must actively move air inside, and oxygen to all cells. 16 They pant or sweat to lose excess water.17 Surface absorption is a major source of oxygen. measured in centimeters, weight ( W ) in kilograms, and surface area in square meters. 2 Express the surface area of your body in square centimeters (cm 2 ). T o estimate your body volume, rst obtain your weight in pounds and convert to kilograms by multiplying by 0.454 kilograms per pound. One kilogram of water has a volume of 1 L, but the body is denser than water due to bones and various other dense tissues. T o determine the volume of your body, multiply its mass in kilo-grams by 0.9 L per kilogram. Now calculate the surface area to volume ratio (cm 2 /L) of your body. Plot surface area to volume ratios as a function of height for the members of your class. Plot student heights on the x - axis, and the corresponding sur- face area to volume ratios on the y - axis. Is there a general relationship between height and surface area to volume ratio? Explain your answer. c15.indd 281 Sourcebook for Teaching Science ACTIVITY 15.5.3 Surface Area to Volume Ratio in Real Life The surface area to volume ratio of an organism or object has a profound infl uence on what it interacts with in its environment. For example, the world ' s largest animal, the blue whale, can attain a length of 110 ft and live comfortably in the ocean. If such a whale were to be beached, its ribs would likely collapse under its immense weight. As the world ' s largest animal, the blue whale has an extremely low surface area to volume ratio. The strength of its bones (proportional to the cross - sectional area of its bones) is not great enough to support its mass (proportional to its volume) once it is no longer supported by water. The surface area to volume ratio also affects the way freshly baked cookies cool. Y ou may have noticed that smaller cookies cool much faster than larger ones. Small cookies have a much higher sur-face area to volume ratio than do large cookies. Since the rate of heat loss is proportional to the surface area of the cookie while its heat content is proportional to its mass, and consequently its vol-ume, a small - scale cookie cools much faster than a large - scale one. Use similar logic to explain the following phenomena. Include in your explana-tions the role of surface area and volume as well as the processes, which are listed in italics. 1. A hot car in the summer time is more danger- ous for infants than adults. ( cooling by sweat- ing, dehydration ) 2. It is proportionately less expensive per item in inventory to build a superstore or warehouse store than it is to build a small store. ( cost of construction, value of store contents ) 3. Larger organisms are made of many small cells rather than a few large cells. ( diffusion of nutri- ents, need for nutrients ) 4. Powdered sugar dissolves faster than an equal mass in the form of a sugar cube. ( solubility ) 5. Elephants have proportionately much larger ears than mice, and this prevents overheating.

No lights, no dishwashers, no hair dryers, no toast-ers, no air conditioning, no computers, no power tools, no electric motors, and so on. Although we are indebted to many scientists and engineers for the luxuries that electricity provides, we are particularly indebted to Danish scientist Hans Christian \u00d8 rsted, who in 1820 showed that an electric current could defl ect a magnetic needle. This simple observation showed that electricity and magnetism are related and opened the door for studies that led to the development of the elec-trical generator (a device that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy by electromagnetic means) and the electric motor (a device that con-verts electrical energy into mechanical energy by electromagnetic means). Without generators we would have no electricity in our homes or busi-ness (except for battery driven devices), and with-out electric motors we would have few electrically powered machines. Although \u00d8 rsted ' s experiments showed that electricity and magnetism are related phenom-ena, he was not the rst to suggest this relation- ship. Others had suspected this because magnetic poles, like electric charges, attract and repel with a force that is dependent on the inverse square of the distance between them. Scientists reasoned that this inverse square relationship was based on a fundamental relationship of the forces, and by the mid - nineteenth century, James Clerk Maxwell and others developed the eld theory of electro- magnetism. In the early part of the twentieth cen-tury, Albert Einstein developed the eld theory of gravitation and attempted to construct a uni ed eld theory in which electromagnetism and grav- ity would emerge as different aspects of a single fundamental eld. Although physicists have failed to demonstrate a uni ed eld, many are still inter- ested because of the similarities shared by gravity and electromagnetism. Just as electricity and magnetism display an inverse square relationship in the strength of forces, so gravity falls off as an inverse square of the dis-tance between two objects. The inverse square rela-tionship, which electricity, gravity, and magnetism demonstrate, has emerged as one of the most important principles of physics, and one that is based primarily on geometry. A basic understand-ing of geometry helps in understanding the infl u- ence of distance on electric force, magnetic force, gravitational forces, light intensity, sound intensity, radiation intensity, and others. Although different in many ways, all of these phenomena share a com-mon geometric principle: they generate a eld or a wave front in all directions, and the intensity of this eld or wave diminishes as it spreads out over more and more area. Imagine throwing a rock into a glassy - smooth pond. Waves emanate in all directions from the point where the rock hits the surface of the pond. As a wave moves from the point of impact, the same energy is spread over an increasingly large area. Initially the waves are tall, but as the waves get farther from the source, they get longer but shorter. What is true of the water wave along the surface of the pond is similar to what happens to any point source that spreads its infl uence equally in all direc- tions. Although the water waves are con ned to the surface of the water, point sources, such as gravita-tional force, electric eld, light, sound, and radia- tion, display a similar attenuation with distance. Some simple geometry will help in understanding the interconnectedness of these phenomena. c15.indd 283 Sourcebook for Teaching Science Figure 15.11A shows a point source (of light or sound, for example) at S. The energy from this point source radiates out as a sphere. The energy that was initially concentrated at S is now spread over the surface of a spherical shape. T o deter-mine the intensity of the energy at this time, we need to divide the total energy by the surface area of the sphere to which it is now distributed. Since the surface area of a sphere can be calculated as A /H11005 4 /H9266 r 2 , the intensity at any point can be cal- culated as IS rr1 24/H11005/H9266 . As the energy continues to radiate, the intensity will decrease as a function of the inverse square (1/ r 2 ) of the radius, even though the amount of energy ( S ) remains con- stant. Figure 15.11B shows that if the intensity of the energy at r /H11005 1 is de ned as I 1 r , then the inten- sity at r /H11005 2 will be IIrr211 4/H11005 , and the intensity at r /H11005 3 will be IIr311 9/H11005 . The intensity falls off as the inverse square of the distance from the source simply because the spherical front on which it resides increases as a function of the surface area. The intensity of anything that radiates uni- formly from a point source will consequently decrease as a function of the inverse square of the distance from the source. If the distance doubles, the total energy remains constant, but is spread over four times as much space, and consequently the energy is only one fourth as intense. Under-standing the basic geometry of a sphere, we can predict that the intensity of anything that radiates from a point sphere will consequently decrease as the inverse square of the distance from the point source. Since it is purely geometric in its origin, the inverse square law applies to diverse phenomena. Point sources of gravitational force, electric eld, light, sound, or radiation obey the inverse square law (Figure AB Figure 15.11 (A) Inverse Square Law and (B) Its Effect on Intensity c15.indd 284 c15.indd 284 5/9/08 11:32:22 AM in Science 285 ACTIVITY 15.6.1 Illumination and the Inverse Square Law Photocopy graph paper onto a piece of stiff card stock paper. Using a craft knife, cut out a window as shown in Figure 15.13 , and record its size. Place the card stock vertically at a distance r (10 - 20 cm works well) from a candle, and record the distance. Place a second piece of graph paper as shown at a distance of 2 r from the candle. Light the can- dle, turn off the lights, and count the number of squares illuminated on the second sheet. Move this sheet to a distance of 3 r, 4 r, and 5 r, and record the number of illuminated squares.

ACTIVITY 15.6.2 Sound, Magnetism and the Inverse Square Law Many people suffer from tinnitus, partial deafness, and other hearing - related problems as a result of listening to music with earphones. Although the power (energy released per unit time) of such devices may be very small, the distance of the sound source from the eardrum is very short, dra-matically increasing the volume. Place an electronic buzzer (available at elec- tronic supply stores) at one end of a meter stick and a sound meter at the other. Make certain the environment is quiet, and then turn on the buzzer. Record the sound level at 20 cm intervals and plot sound level (in decibels) as a function of distance from the source. If you have access to a magne-tometer, repeat the process to see the relationship between magnetic eld strength and distance. A magnetometer is a device used to measure the strength of a magnetic eld. A compass is essen- tially a magnetometer bu t does not record in useful units. The best option is to use sound and magne-tometer probes and probeware with your computer (see sciencesourcebook.com ). Such devices provide continuous readouts and are generally accurate. 1. What is the relationship between sound level (intensity) and distance from the sound source? 2. Compare the graph of sound intensity as a func- tion of distance with the graph of light inten-sity and magnetism as a function of distance (above). Are the intensities of light, sound, and magnetism all functions of the inverse square of the distance from the source? Explain your answer. ACTIVITY 15.6.3 Agriculture on Other Planets? With the exception of chemosynthetic bacte-ria, all life is dependent on sunlight. Plants are autotrophic, meaning that they produce their own food through the process of photosynthesis. Animals, however, are heterotrophic, dependent on plants or other animals for their energy. All civilizations are dependent on agriculture, and there fore dependent on the light of the Sun. Many science - ction writers have imagined the coloni- zation of other planets, but how practical would such an endeavor be even if we could deliver peo-ple and materials to these faraway worlds? According to the inverse square law, the inten- sity of light decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the light source. Doubling the dis-tance from the Sun results in a fourfold reduction in light intensity. We know that the average light intensity on Earth is adequate for agriculture, but how about on distant planets? Table 15.6 shows the relative distance between the planets and the Sun. The average distance from the Sun to Earth is 149,597,870 km (92,955,807 miles), a distance r2r Figure 15.13 Illumination and the Inverse Square Law Table 15.6 Solar Intensity Relative to Earth Planet AU I planet / I Earth Mercury 0.387 Venus 0.723 Earth 11:32:23 AMGeometric Principles in Science 287 that astronomers call 1 astronomical unit, or 1 AU. Since the average distance between the Sun and the Earth is de ned as 1 AU, planets closer to the Sun have distances less than 1 AU, while planets farther from the Sun have distances greater than 1 AU. How does the intensity of the light on these planets compare with the intensity of light on Earth, knowing that intensity is a function of the inverse square of distance from the Sun? Complete Table 15.6 ; then create a graph with the distance of the planets from the Sun measured in AUs on the x - axis (independent variable), and the intensity of light on these planets, measured relative to the intensity on earth (I planet /I Earth ) on the y - axis (dependent variable). 1. Do you think that it would be possible to grow food in planetary greenhouses on any of the inner rocky planets: Mercury, Venus, or Mars? 2.

What was the intensity of light from the sun at this point? ACTIVITY 15.6.4 Applications of the Inverse Square Law The following are true statements. Explain each using the inverse square law. 1. The largest antennae in the world are radio telescopes, detecting radio waves from distant galaxies. 2. Immunotherapy is used to treat cancer. Scientists nd antibodies that attack speci c cancer cells, then separate the antibodies in the laboratory and derive millions of copies. The antibodies are doped with radioactive molecules and given to the patient. The radioactivity kills the cancerous cells to which the antibodies cling but has little effect on surrounding tissues. 3. Pseudoscientists have warned of the dire grav- itational effects associated with the alignment of Jupiter, Mars, and the Moon. Although these are massive objects, the combined force of attrac tion of these objects causes no notice-able effects on Earth. 4. There is no such thing as a position around the Earth in which there is zero gravity. Astro-nauts orbiting the earth are simply in a contin-ual state of free fall and therefore experience zero gravity, even though they are well within the gravitational eld of the Earth. 15.7 Scienti c Applications of Conic Sections In 1977, NASA launched Voyager 2, an unmanned craft that collected a tremendous number of data as it fl ew past Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus before reaching Neptune in 1989. For this interplanetary travel to be successful, scientists had to calculate the precise position of the planets in their ellipti-cal orbits around the Sun, as well as predict the hazards posed by the elliptical orbits of asteroids and the elliptical, parabolic or possibly hyperbolic paths of comets. The craft collected data on the circular rings around Saturn and discov-ered the cir cular rings around Uranus. Data from numerous scienti c instruments were sent back to Earth using parabolic transmitting antennas and received by large parabolic receiving antennae in NASA ' s Deep Space Network. Although Voyager 2 was perhaps the most advanced scienti c and engineering feat ever accom- plished to that time, it was dependent on an under-standing of geometric principles discovered more than 2000 years earlier. In approximately 200 b.c., the great mathematician Apollonius of Perga wrote a treatise entitled Conics, in which he dis- cussed the mathematics of circles, ellipses, parabo-las, and hyperbolas \u2014 shapes created when a plane a cone ( conic sections, Figure 15.14 ). Apollonius ' s work was forgotten for many years but was rediscovered during the Renaissance and helped lay the mathematical foundation for the scienti c revolution. Conic sections have proven to have many scienti c and technological applications, which we discuss following a brief introduction of the mathematics. Figure 15.14 shows two cones that c15.indd 287 AM 5/9/08 11:32:24 AM288 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science share the same axis of symmetry and the same vertex but are positioned in opposite directions. A circle is formed if a plane perpendicular to the cone axis intersects one of the cones at any point but the vertex (Figure 15.14A ). A parabola is formed when a cone is intersected by a plane par-allel to the surface of the cone (Figure 15.4B ). An ellipse is formed when a plane intersects a cone at an angle between the angle perpendicular to the cone axis and the angle parallel to the surface of the cone (Figure 15.14C ). A hyperbola is formed when the plane intersects both parts of the cone (Figure 15.14D ). Variations of these shapes are formed when different shapes of cones are used. Each of the conic sections can be described by a unique equa-tion (Table 15.7 ). For any of the equations with a center ( j, k ) instead of (0, 0), replace each x term with ( x /H11002 j ) and each y term with ( y /H11002 k ) . The circle, and its three - dimensional rotation, the sphere, are characterized by a constant radius. Anything that radiates evenly from a source will assume a spherical shape. For example, the sound waves emanating from a recracker travel in a spher ical fashion when it is detonated, and the light from a candle proceeds in a spherical wave front circle ellipse parabolaparabola hyperbolaA B CD Figure 15.14 Conic Sections Are Determined by the Plane of Intersection Table 15.7 Equations for Conic Sections Circle Ellipse Parabola Hyperbola Equation ( horizontal vertex) x 2 /H11001 y 2 /H11005 r 2 x 2 / a 2 /H11001 y / b 2 /H11005 1 4 px /H11005 y 2 x 2 / a 2 /H11002 y 2 / b 2 /H11005 1 Equation (vertical vertex) x 2 /H11001 y 2 /H11005 r 2 y 2 / a 2 /H11001 x 2 / b 2 /H11005 1 4 py /H11005 x 2 y 2 / a 2 /H11002 x 2 / b 2 /H11005 1 Variables r /H11005 circle radius i /H11005 major radius ( /H11005 1/2 length major axis) i /H11005 minor radius ( /H11005 1/2 length minor axis) p /H11005 distance from vertex to focus (or directrix) a /H11005 1/2 length major axis i /H11005 1/2 length minor axis De nition distance to the or igin is constant sum of distances to each focus is constant distance to focus /H11005 distance to directrix difference between distances to each focus is constant c15.indd 288 c15.indd 288 5/9/08 11:32:24 AM 5/9/08 11:32:24 AMGeometric Principles in Science 289 until it is interrupted by a barrier. A basketball, volleyball, or soccer ball becomes spherical when infl ated as air presses uniformly on the inner walls of the ball. The parabola, and its three - dimensional rota- tion, the paraboloid, are open curves such that the path to the focus and the path to a horizontal line known as the directrix are equal (Figure 15.15A ). Anything that enters a parabola as parallel rays will concentrate at the focus, and anything emanating from the focus will exit the parabola as parallel rays. Figure 15.15B shows how parallel rays ema-nating from a light bulb refl ect off the parabolic surface and exit as parallel rays. The ellipse, and its three - dimensional rotation, the ellipsoid, are similar to the circle and sphere but have one axis that is longer than the other. Although the radii may differ in length, the sum of the radii is constant. An ellipse can be drawn by placing two pins (foci) in cardboard and con-necting them by a string longer than the distance between the pins. When a pen is constrained by the string, an ellipse will be drawn (Figure 15.15C ). The length of the string and the distance between the pins will determine the shape of the ellipse. Planets travel in elliptical paths around the Sun, with the Sun at one focus. The axis between peri- gee (the position where Earth is closest to the Sun) and apogee (the position where the Earth is farthest from the Sun) is the major axis of the ellipse. The hyperbola, and its three - dimensional rota- tion, the hyperboloid, are open, two - branched curves. These are de ned as the surface created by points such that the difference of the distances between two xed points ( foci ) is constant (Figure 15.15D ). c and Technologi cal Examples of Conic Sections Following is a list of the practical applications of conic sections (circle, parabola, ellipse, and hyper-bola) or their three - dimensional rotations (sphere, paraboloid, ellipsoid, and hyperboloid). Identify each of the following as a circle, parabola, ellipse, hyper-bola, sphere, paraboloid, ellipsoid, or hyperboloid. 1. The celestial equator is a(n) projection into space of the Earth ' s equator. Astronomers use the celestial equator to ref-erence the position of stars and other celestial objects. 2. If a source of sound is placed at one focus of a(n) room, the sound con-verges on the other focus. For this reason, concert halls do not have this shape. 3 . Loran is an acronym for long - range navigation, a technology developed during World War II to identify the location of ships at sea. Two trans-mitters (A1, A2) beam radio signals from xed points at land. Upon analyzing the time differ-ence between the two signals, the onboard Loran system determines the speci c curve on which the boat must be located (Figure 15.15D ). This process is repeated with a differ-ent set of transmitters (B1, B2), and the inter-section of the resulting curves identi es the boat ' s precise location. focus 2 focus 1r1r2directrix focusA focus focusBC r2-r1 = constantD Figure 15.15 (A) De nition of a Parabola.

The high - beam lamp in an automobile head light is placed at the focus of a(n) refl ecting surface, such that the emanating light refl ects off the curved surface and leaves in par- allel rays, lighting the distant road. 5.

A free throw in basketball, a line drive in base- ball, and a long bomb in fo otball all follow a(n) path (neglecting air friction). 8. A returning comet follows a(n) highly eccen- tric path with the Sun at one focus. As the comet approaches perihelion (the closest it gets to the Sun), solar winds (high - energy particles from the Sun) lengthen the tail of the comet and sunlight illuminates it, making it long and visible. As the comet approaches the other focus deep in the solar system, the tail shrinks, and the comet becomes invisible to the Earth - bound observer. 9.

Although the Earth appears to be a sphere, it is actually more nearly a(n) . The fl attening of the ellipse of the Earth is only about 1 part in 300 but is signi cant enough to become a necessary part of calcu-lations in plotting accurate maps at a scale of 1:100,000 or greater. 18.

When two rocks are dropped in the water at the same time, they create radiating rings.

Answers to Chapter Activities 15.1.1 Scales depend on the degree to which the original is enlarged. 15.2.1 1 - direct (the Mars Exploration Rover and other Martian probes have made direct measurements of the surface temperature of Mars), 2 - direct, 3 - direct, 4 - direct, 5 - indi-rect (bond lengths are too small to measure directly), 6 - direct, 7 - direct, 8 - indirect (we can infer the age of the bristlecones by examining tree rings and other evidence, but cannot measure their age directly), 9 - indirect, 10 - indirect, 11 - indirect (it is impossible to weigh the Moon or any other celestial body, so measurements must c15.indd 290 c15.indd 290 5/9/08 11:32:27 AM 5/9/08 11:32:27 AMGeometric Principles in Science 291 be made indirectly), 12 - direct, 13 - indirect (no space probes have ever landed on Pluto, so measurements of its surface temperature must have been made indi-rectly), 14 - indirect (such a conclusion is made on the basis of statistical data of a small sample size, and not on direct measurement of the entire population), 15 - direct. 15.2.2 The accepted diameter of the Moon is 3476 km. Student answers will vary. 15.2.3 Student answers will vary. 15.2.4 Student answers will vary. 15.3.3 The accepted circumference of the Earth is 40,008 km. Student answers will vary, but most should calculate a percentage error less than 10 percent. 15.4.1 (1) The surface area to volume ratio decreases as the size of the cube increases. (2) The surface area to mass ratio decreases as the size of the cube increases. (3) Y es. (4) Phytoplankton are small, and thus have a higher surface area to volume ratio than if they were larger. The spines also increase the surface area to vol-ume ratio. Since drag increases with increasing surface area, spiny phytoplankton will not sink even though they may be denser than the ocean water. (5) A baby is more susceptible to chilling because it has a high sur-face area to volume ratio and loses heat faster relative to its mass than does an adult. (6) Very small animals lose heat faster than very large animals. It is easier for large animals to stay warm in the winter and for small animals to stay cool in the summer, all other factors being vary, but students should notice that the surface area to volume ratio decreases as height increases. 15.5.3 (1) Small children have a high surface area to volume ratio. They therefore heat up more rapidly in a hot car. They cool readily due to sweating that takes place over their proportionately large surface area, but may dehydrate more rapidly because they have relatively low body volumes, and consequently low reservoirs of water. (2) The cost of construction for a warehouse is more highly correlated with surface area (walls) than volume (empty space inside). Large stores have a high volume to surface area ratio, meaning they can store lots of goods with relatively little construc- tion cost. (3) For cells to survive, nutrients must dif- fuse in and out. Diffusion rates are increased by large surface areas but decreased by long diffusion paths. Diffusion is much more ef cient in small cells because they possess a higher surface area to volume ratio. (4) Dissolution requires direct contact between the sol-ute (sugar) and the solvent (water). In powdered form, the surface area to volume ratio is high, increasing the rate at which sugar dissolves. (5) Elephants are large and have a very low surface area to volume ratio. The large ears of elephants are radiators, dissipating heat through their large surface area and thereby prevent- ing overheating. (6) Nutrient absorption is a major issue for large organisms due to their low surface area (absorption surface) to volume (nutrient demanding tissue) ratio. Microvilli increase the surface area and increase nutrient and water absorption. (7) Absorption of oxygen from the surrounding environment is no problem for single - celled organisms because absorp-tion is a function of surface area and they have high surface area to volume ratios. By contrast, larger organ-isms have an oxygen demand due to high volume to surface area ratios. T o provide suf cient oxygen for the disproportionately large volume and mass of tissues, larger organisms have lungs that dramatically increase the absorptive surface area. (8) Cacti have large stems and no leaves. They also have a large volume of water relative to their surface area. Since they have low sur-face area to absorb heat and high volume of water that acts as a heat sink, cacti rarely overheat. (9) Small ani-mals have a large surface area to volume ratio. Since heat is lost through the surface and since heat produc-tion is a function of volume, they must eat more regu-larly to deal with the proportionately greater heat loss. (10) The force of gravity is a function of the mass and, indirectly, the volume of an organism. The adhesion between an organism and a surface is a function of the area of the surface in contact. The high surface area to volume ratio of insects maximizes the adhesive prop-erties while minimizing the force of gravity. (11) Heat is a function of mass and therefore indirectly a func-tion of volume. Heat exchange is a function of surface area. Consequently crushed ice, which has a very high surface area to volume ratio, melts more rapidly than block ice. 15.6.1 (1) The surface area increases as a square of the dis- tance from the light source. (2) Intensity is a function of the inverse square of the distance from the light source. Figure 15.16 is a plot of intensity as a function of distance. (3) IEnergy r/H11005source Sourcebook for Teaching Science 15.6.2 Students will develop a graph for sound and magnet- ism that resembles Figure 15.16 . (1) Sound intensity is a function of the inverse square of the distance from the sound source. (2) Y es. The inverse square law is a geometric principle and applies to anything that radi-ates from a point source. 15.6.3 St udents should calculate values as shown in Table 15.8 and draw a graph such as illustrated in Figure 15.17 . (1) The light intensity on Mercury and Venus is very high, and greenhouses would have to reduce the amount of light. The greater challenge would be the temperature and atmosphere of these planets, both of which are extremely hostile for life. On Mars, the light intensity is only about 43 percent that on Earth, so crops could not fl ourish unless the light intensity was boosted with mirrors and the atmosphere in green-houses controlled to match that on Earth. (2) The light intensity on Neptune is approximately 0.1 per-cent the intensity here on Earth. 15.6.4 (1) Radio signal strength drops off as the inverse square of the distance from the source. Radio waves produced in distant galaxies are extremely faint due to the inverse square law and the great distances from Earth. Large antennae are necessary to gather signals large enough to analyze. (2) The radioactively tagged antibodies selectively bind to the cancerous cells. Since radiation emanates from these uniformly in all directions, the intensity of the radiation will fall off as a function of the inverse square of distance from the antibody. The cancerous cells to which the radioactive antibodies bind are destroyed, while only minimal damage is infl icted on surrounding tissues, which receive much less radia-tion due to their distance from the radioactive source and the inverse square law. (3) Since gravity is a func-tion of the inverse square of the distance from the center of mass, the attractive force of Mars and Jupiter will be extremely small in comparison with the smaller but much closer Moon. (4) The universal law of gravitation incorporates the inverse square law: FGmm rg/H1100512 2. . The Earth exerts gravity on the spacecraft and everything else in the universe, but its effect diminishes rapidly as distance increases. As distance, r, approaches in nity, the force of the Earth ' s gravity becomes negligible. 15.7.1 (1) circular, (2) elliptical, (3) hyperbolic, (4) parabolic, (5) elliptical, (6) elliptical, (7) parabolic, (8) elliptical, (9) parabolic, (10) parabolic, (11) parabolic, (12) para-bolic, (13) parabolic, (14) hyperbola, (15) elliptical, (16) spherical, (17) ellipsoid, (18) circular, (19) circular, (20) spherical, (21) ellipsoid, (22) parabola, (23) hyper-bola, (24) parabolic, (25) parabola. 0%100%200%300%400%500%600%700% 0 5 10 15 20 25 30good light intensity for agricultureMercury Venus Earth MarsJupiter Saturn Uranus Neptunetoo bright for agriculture too dim for agriculture Distance from Sun (AU)Light Intensity Relative to on Earth Figure 15.17 Intensity of Sunlight on PlanetsTable 15.8 Solar Intensity Relative to Earth Planet (AU) AM293Chapter Sixteen Diagramming and Visualizing Problems in Science For the Teacher 293 16.1 Vector Diagrams 295 16.2 Interpreting Scienti c Diagrams 298 16.3 Pictorial Riddles 301 16.4 Analyzing Photographs 304 16.5 Digital Movies and Animations 310 16.6 Extrapolation 316 16.7 Interactive Scienti c Simulations 318 Answers to Chapter Activities 319 For the Teacher Bloodhounds have a sense of smell that is approx- imately 100 million times more sensitive than that of humans. A bloodhound is able to follow the trail of a fugitive or missing person even 2 or 3 days after the person has left. Bloodhounds learn well by olfaction (smell) and can identify people, plants, animals, and objects by the unique odors they emit. Although humans also learn by smell (olfaction) and taste (gustation), we learn prima-rily through vision, hearing, and touch. Learners acquire information through all modalities but often exhibit preferences. Visual learners learn best by pictures, charts, diagrams, movies, and illus-trated procedures. Auditory learners learn best by listening to directions, explanations, and lectures and by talking with and explaining to others. Kinesthetic learners learn best by doing: moving, manipulating, and gesturing. Although studies have shown that visual learners represent the largest portion of the pop-ulation, many teachers fail to use visual learning techniques, relying on lectures, discussion, and other nonvisual modes of instruction. Since it is easier to talk about something than it is to illus-trate it, many people default to verbal descriptions, neglecting the bene ts that visual instruction provides. T eachers should strive to incorporate visual, auditory, and kinesthetic components in their instruction. This chapter focuses on visual for Teaching Science a brain tumor. Initially each type of imaging tech- nology was simply a curiosity, but as researchers learned to perfect and interpret the images, these technologies became invaluable diagnostic tools. Imaging technologies have revolutionized not only medicine but also astronomy, biology, chem-istry, physics, and every other branch of science, enabling scientists to understand the structure and order of the natural world. Scientists use diagrams, photos, and graphics on a daily basis, and science teachers should do so as well to communicate the concepts and relationships in teaching . Although graphics, charts, diagrams, and pho- tos are essential tools in science education, many students do not make good use of them. Often students memorize graphics rather than spending time to understand what they represent. T o ensure understanding, teachers should use a variety of graphics for the same topic so students learn to abstract basic principles and transfer concepts, regardless of the form in which they are presented. Fortunately, it is easy to obtain alternative dia-grams and photographs with the aid of a graphic search engine. Search the Internet for alterna-tive images of the concepts you are teaching, and present them in class to help students develop generalized understandings. For example, stu-dents learn human anatomy primarily by study-ing line diagrams of the human body. T eachers should augment this instruction with a variety of images: photographs, microscope slides, X - rays, PET scans, CAT scans, and electron micrographs. Search for the Internet for such images, download them to your computer, cite your sources, and project them so all students can see. Organize your photos and diagrams in folders and subfolders within your photo management software so you can easily access them as needed. Most photo management software provides pre-views so you can scroll through the library of images and select just the relevant ones to project (Figure 16.3 ). Help your students recognize fea-tures in these images and correlate them with dia-grams or photographs of the same structures in their textbooks. The use of images will make your presentations more interesting and relevant, and help students develop better analytical skills. Pictures, photographs, and diagrams are invaluable tools at every level of education and profession. Preschoolers learn the alphabet by associating symbols with pictures (Figure 16.1 A), while physics and engineering students learn cir-cuit elements by associating electronic compo-nents with schematic symbols (Figure 16.1 B). Informational graphics are foundational for learn-ing science, making new discoveries, and applying scienti c principles to real - life problems. Consider the pictures in Figure 16.2 . Each illustrates cancer, but in different ways. Figure 16.2 A is a chest X - ray that shows a tumor in the left lobe of the lung. Figure 16.2 B is a microscope slide of normal and cancerous cells from a patient with breast cancer.

The activities in this chapter are designed to facilitate the development of observational and interpretive skills. Samples of various types of exercises are provided, and I encourage you to develop additional exercises that meet your cur-ricular needs. 16.1 Vector Diagrams Physics is the most basic science and is essential for understanding chemistry, biology, geology, meteorology, and the other sciences. Unlike other sciences, however, most of what is studied in phys-ics cannot be seen. While geologists photograph rocks and minerals and biologists photograph cells and organisms, no one has ever taken a photo-graph of force, electricity, magnetism, heat, grav-ity, time, torque, inertia, or momentum! How can you study something that cannot be seen? Although the properties of physics are invisi- ble, they can be measured and quanti ed with var- ious instruments. It is impossible to photograph the force with which the Earth pulls on your body, for example, but you can quantify it by standing on a scale. If a property can be quanti ed, it can be made visible through the use of a diagram. Force, for example, is traditionally illustrated by an arrow known as a vector (Figure 16.4 ). The length of a vector is proportional to its magnitude or strength, and the bearing refl ects its direction. Scientists and engineers use vectors to visualize and communicate force. Figure 16.4 is a vector diagram that illustrates the four basic aerodynamic forces that act on an airplane in fl ight. Although none of these forces can be seen, they can be visualized by four vec-tors. Studying these vectors enables understanding and predicting the motion of the airplane. Gravity acts to pull the plane down and is the weight of the aircraft (F gravity /H11005 weight). If the vertical com- ponent of the lift (F lift ) created by the wings is equal to the weight of the aircraft (F gravity ), the plane will remain at the same elevation. If the lift is greater, the plane will climb, and if it is less, the plane will descend. Thrust (F thrust ) is the force pro- duced by the engine and is directed forward along the axis of the engine. Thrust is countered by air resistance or drag (F drag ), which acts opposite to the direction of fl ight. If these forces are balanced A B C D E Figure 16.3 Photo-Viewing Software FliftFnet=0A B C D Figure 16.4 Force Vectors Acting on a Plane in Flight c16.indd 295 c16.indd 295 5/9/08 6:10:32 PM 5/9/08 6:10:32 PM296 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science (vectors are equal in length but opposite in direc- tion), the plane will fl y forward at constant veloc- ity (no acceleration). If the thrust vector is longer than the drag vector, the plane will accelerate, and if the drag vector is longer than the thrust vector, the plane will decelerate. T o determine the net force on an object, add all of the vectors head to tail, such that the head (tip of the arrow) of one vector is touching the tail (base of the arrow) of the next vector. The sum of the vectors can be represented by one vector that starts at the tail (base) of the rst vector and ends at the tip (head) of the last vector. This vector is known as the resultant and illustrates the net force acting upon the object. Figure 16.4 A shows the force vectors acting on a plane that is maintaining constant elevation and velocity. When the vectors are added head to tail, they perfectly balance, showing that there is no net force or acceleration (Figure 16.4 B). Note that the resultant vector is zero because the head of the last arrow ends at the tail of the rst. By con- trast, Figure 16.4 C illustrates a situation in which the vectors do not balance. Note that the engines are exerting more thrust, and the plane is angled slightly up. This changes the directions of the lift, thrust, and drag forces, and if one adds the vec-tors head to tail as before, there is a resultant vec-tor, illustrating a net force acting up and forward (Figure 16.4 D). This indicates that the plane must be accelerating in this direction. ACTIVITY 16.1.1 Vector Diagrams Vector diagrams enable visualizing the invisible. In Figures 16.5 A and 16.5 B, the vectors represent forces, while in Figure 16.5 C, they represent veloc-ities. Each of the vector diagrams in Figure 16.5 tells a story. Analyze each of the vector diagrams, and match it to one of the stories listed. 1 . Force vectors: The following is a series of stories. Match each story with a force vector diagram illustrated in Figure 16.5 A. Neglect friction. (a) A tug - of - war in which no team wins (b) A jet being pushed by a strong tailwind (c) The wind pushing a sailboat forward (d) A jet encountering a strong headwind 2 . Force vectors: Friction always acts opposite to the direction of an applied force. Each of the following stories involves friction. Match each story with a vector diagram in Figure 16.5 B. (a) A mountain biker rides through deep sand. (b) A tow truck is unable to pull a car out of the sand. (c) A skydiver is falling at constant speed after the chute has opened. (d) A skydiver is accelerating before the chute has opened. 3 . Velocity vectors: Velocity has magnitude and direction and therefore can be illustrated with vectors. By convention, upward arrows indicate north, or away from the Earth, and downward arrows indicate south, or toward the Earth.

(a) A bicyclist travels east in a strong south (north - heading) wind. (b) A motorboat crosses the Mississippi River from Arkansas to T ennessee. (c) An apple hangs on a tree. (d) The space shuttle lifts off the launch pad. 4 . Force vectors: Figure 16.6 displays vector dia- grams that describe conditions for a box on an inclined plane. Match each of the following stories with a vector diagram. Note that gravi-tational force is resolved into a force acting downhill (the accelerating force parallel to the surface, F a ) and a force acting at right angles toward the surface (perpendicular force, F /H11036 ). A description of the component forces follows: F mg \u2014 gravitational force; product of the mass, m, and the acceleration due to gravity, g F /H11036 \u2014 perpendicular force; component of grav- ity acting at right angles to surface F a \u2014 parallel force; component of gravity act- ing parallel to surface F N \u2014 normal force, acting at right angles away from the surface; equal and opposite to F /H11036 F f \u2014 frictional force, acting opposite the direc- tion of motion (a) A box bends the ramp.

Learning to \" read \" diagrams is an essential skill in science. Diagrams explain without using sentences, and we can usually make reasonable inferences even in the absence of explanatory text. The following activities are about a series of diagrams that explain certain phenom-ena. Answer the questions by analyzing the dia-grams, even if you are unfamiliar with the content. ACTIVITY 16.2.1 Ray Diagrams Figure 16.7 shows how a single biconvex lens can create a variety of images depending on its location relative to the object it is imaging. If the object is at a great distance away, so that the light rays coming from it are parallel, all light will condense at one spot, named the focal point, F (Figure 16.7 A). If, however, the object (solid arrow) is relatively close to the lens but beyond the focal length, the light rays emanat-ing from it will not be parallel when they reach the lens and will converge on the other side to make real images (Figures 16.7 B - 16.7 E). Match the following phrases (place in the rst blank in questions 1 to 6) and the correct part of Figure 16.7 ( 16.7 A - 16.7 F; place in the second blank) with the corresponding written descriptions. Note that this activity does not require knowledge of physics, but it does require you to analyze and interpret the diagrams. Possible Phrases for First Blank at the focal length at two times the focal length between the focal length and two times the focal length beyond two times the focal length far from the lens inside the focal length 1. When an object is , as in example , no real image is formed, but the viewer sees an enlarged, virtual image on the same side as the object. This is used in hand lenses such as those used by eld biologists, geolo- gists, or jewelers. 2. When an object is , as in example , the image is the same size but inverted. Inverting lenses are used in telescopes so that images appear upright after they have been enlarged by other lenses. 3. When an object is , as in example , the image will be larger and inverted. Enlarging lenses are used by photographers to create photographic enlargements.

When an object is , as in example , the image will be inverted and reduced. This is used in cameras to place real images on lm or photo sensors. 5. When an object is , as in example , all rays will be emitted parallel, and no image will be formed. This arrangement is found in fl ashlights and searchlights. 6. When an object is , as in example , all of the rays converge at the focal point. This arrangement is used when starting a re in the sunlight with a magnifying lens. ACTIVITY 16.2.2 Interpreting Scienti c Diagrams If a diagram is clear, it should be possible to inter-pret it with minimal written explanation. Examine Figures 16.8 A to 16.8 D, and answer the following questions based solely on the information provided in the questions and the diagrams. Y ou do not need to have knowledge of the subjects presented. 1. The Earth slowly precesses so that its axis points at different stars at different times.

The moon will orbit the Earth in a lunar month of approximately 28 days. At the bottom of the diagram are the phases of the Moon as viewed from Earth. Correlate the positions of the Moon (num-bers) with the phases of the Moon (letters). ACTIVITY 16.2.3 Developing Your Own Diagrams Drawing diagrams can help you conceptualize problems and communicate them to others with-out the need for lengthy explanations. Consider the following situation: Copper and iron electrodes are placed in a solution of copper sulfate and connected by wires to a battery. When they are subjected to an electric eld, sulfate ions move toward the positively charged copper electrode, while cop-per ions move toward the negatively charged iron electrode where they form a copper plate. Although this description is accurate, many people, particularly those with limited English pro ciency, will nd Figure 16.9 much easier to understand and conceptualize. Combining a written explanation with a diagram and spoken explanation provides a much better learning envi-ronment than any one or two approaches alone. It has been said that the best way to learn is to teach another. Developing diagrams to explain concepts is a way of sharing your ideas with oth-ers, and in the process you will learn them better yourself. Develop diagrams as directed by your teacher, and write accompanying explanations. The following list presents possible ideas, but it may be better to select ones from what you are working on in class as directed by your teacher. Study relevant chapters or sections as necessary, but do not copy existing diagrams. Environmental science: succession, food web, water cycle, carbon cycle, groundwater pollu-tion, photochemical smog production Chemistry: titration, distillation, bright line spectrum, electroplating, electrolysis, ioniza-tion, fusion, ssion Biology: electrophoresis, gene splicing, DNA replication, transcription, enzyme function, biological magni cation Earth science: rock cycle, cloud formation, seasonal overturn, Coriolis effect, subduction, star formation Physics: forces acting on a car, magnetic eld around a wire, electromagnetic radiation, components of velocity of a thrown football, nuclear decay + _ Cu Fe SO4Cu++ Figure 16.9 Electroplating 5/9/08 6:10:36 PM 5/9/08 6:10:36 PMDiagramming and Visualizing Problems in Science 301 16.3 Pictorial Riddles A riddle is a question or statement posed so that it requires ingenuity to determine its answer or meaning. Consider the following riddle: \" What appears to lie at your feet in the morning, follow you all day long, nearly vanish at noon, and dis-appear at night? \" The riddle is phrased in such a way that you might rst think of a pet, but this does not t the last two clues. T o solve the riddle requires \" thinking outside the box \" and consider inanimate objects as well, in which case you might realize that your shadow meets the criteria of the riddle. Riddles are engaging and demand creative thinking. Pictorial riddles are riddles in graphic form. Ingenuity is required to analyze the pictures and arrive at reasonable solutions. In the activities that follow, students will work with a variety of types of pictorial riddles. ACTIVITY 16.3.1 Time - Series Pictorial Riddles Figures 16.10 to 16.14 are time - series riddles. The rst pictures in a series represent earlier times, and later pictures represent later times. T o solve such riddles, you must supply a process or activity that occurs between the various pictures that can ade-quately explain why the pictures have changed over time. For example, Figure 16.10 shows a series of pictures of a magnetic compass. What can explain the different orientations of the compass nee-dle from the rst moment to the nal moment? A geologist might explain that there is a tremendous amount of time between each event, and the direc-tionality of the compass refl ects the changing mag- netic eld of the Earth. At some times in geological history, the magnetic north pole was near the geo-graphic North Pole (Figures 16.10 A, 16.10 C), while at other times the polarity of the Earth ' s magnetic eld was reversed such that the magnetic North Pole was near the geographic South Pole ( gures 16.10 B, 16.10 D). By contrast, a physicist might suggest that the compass needle spins because of a chang-ing magnetic eld induced by a local magnet. For example, if you move a magnet around a compass, the needle will follow it. Riddles may therefore have more than one reasonable solution. Provide reason-able solutions for pictorial riddles 16.10 to 16.14. 1. Figure 16.11 represents magnetic compasses. Suggest processes or events that explain the change from A to C. 2.

Suggest processes or events that explain the change from A to B and from C to D. 7. Figure 16.17 represents radio waves emanating from a motion detector. Examine the patterns of refl ected waves, and match the following descriptions with the appropriate diagrams.

Seventy - three seconds into fl ight the Challenger exploded, killing all seven crew mem- bers. Engineers pinned the disaster on a faulty O - ring seal in the right solid rocket booster. When the seal failed, a fl ame leaked from the booster and damaged the adjacent propellant tank. Although the O - ring looked like other ones produced by the manufacturer, apparently it was different in at least one critical aspect. Unfortunately, this difference was not detected prior to lift - off. Scientists, engineers, and manufacturers fre- quently analyze things for similarities and dif-ferences. Manufacturers employ quality control technicians to ensure that all products meet speci- cations. Quality control technicians protect the public from defective products and employers from lawsuits. They must develop good analyti-cal skills so they can determine which products are good and which are not. The ability to analyze things for similarities and differences is vital to science and industry. In this activity, you will exercise this skill as you analyze sets of plants and animals for similari-ties and differences. For example, in Figure 16.21 A the penguin does not t with the others. Although all ve are large marine animals, four are mam- mals, while the penguin is a bird. Examine each of the sets in Figure 16.21 and determine which one does not belong with the others. ACTIVITY 16.3.3 What ' s Wrong with This Picture? \" What ' s wrong with this picture? \" is a popular game found in children ' s magazines. An otherwise normal picture has odd things hidden in it that the reader must discover. These games are popu-lar and challenging, and they require the analytical skills used in scienti c reasoning. Examine Figures 16.22 A to 16.22 M, and determine what ' s wrong with each picture. Explain in complete sentences.

The image was recorded in 1826 by French inventor Nic \u00e9 phore Ni \u00e9 pce. Despite the graininess of the photo, a viewer can make observations and inferences about the environment in which the camera was sitting at the time the lm was exposed. For exam- ple, the shadows indicate that the photograph was taken when the Sun was above and to the right of the camera. The gray and black shapes are proba-bly roofs, eaves, walls, and windows, and it appears as though the camera was resting on a wall or win-dowsill above a courtyard. It is likely that the pho-tograph was taken in the country, as there appear to be a tree and eld in the distance. Photographs provide a tremendous amount of information that is useful to historians, physicians, scientists, and other professionals. Photography enables us to study environments, events, and processes and to share our ndings with others. Every photograph contains infor-mation, and photography has become a univer-sal tool in scienti c research. T oday, scientists use photographs to study giant events such as storms on Earth (Figure 16.24 A) and Jupiter (Figure 16.24 B), or in nitesimal structures such as the viruses that cause polio (Figure 16.24 C) or Ebola fever (Figure 16.24 D). Drawings and photographs give us the ability to study phenomena over time.

Two centuries later, Wilhelm T empel ' s scale drawings demon-strated that this speck was two to three times the diameter of the Earth, and in 1979, the American space probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 sent back photographs (Figure 16.25 ) demonstrating that Cassini ' s speck, now known as the Great Red Spot, is actually a massive, centuries - old storm. Drawings and photographs give us information to help us understand the dynamics of phenomena through- out the universe.

Oncologists (doctors who treat cancer patients) hope to identify cancers in their earliest stages so that they can treat patients before cancer spreads. It is dif cult to determine if a patient has cancer simply by interview or external appearance, so oncologists rely heavily on medical imaging techniques such as X - rays (Figure 16.28 A), microscope photographs from tissue samples (Figure 16.28 B), and PET (positron emission tom-ography) scans (Figure 16.28 C) to detect the pres-ence and location of cancerous tissues. Cancer is a collection of diseases characterized by rapid, uncontrolled cell division of abnormal cells. These cells may interfere with normal - functioning cells. Oncologists analyze images for abnormal growths and tissues. Pretend that you are an oncologist as you analyze the evidence from the following images: 1. Figure 16.28 A is a chest X - ray of a patient with lung cancer. Identify the location where you think the cancerous tissue is.

Figure 16.27 Photograph of the Stars ACTIVITY 16.4.2 Making Inferences from Photographs An inference is a tentative conclusion that is reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning. Scientists must frequently make inferences, but inferences are only as good as the evidence and reasoning behind them. Figure 16.27 is a pho-tograph of the stars that I took. Examine it, and answer each of the following questions, support-ing your conclusions with evidence and reasoning. 1.

ACTIVITY 16.4.4 Identifying Structures from Medical Images Assume you are a medical doctor, and a patient complains of frequent headaches. Y ou must make a diagnosis, but you know that headaches may be caused by narcotics, migraines, pressure in the meninges, swelling of blood vessels, eyestrain, electrolyte imbalance, low blood sugar, neck pain, head trauma, cancer, or many other possibilities. T o make an accurate diagnosis, you need more information, much of which can be obtained by medical imaging technologies such as X - rays, CT scans, PET scans, sonograms, and MRI scans (Figures 16.29 A to 16.29 E). These technologies, explained below, allow you to visualize things CT ScanA B C E D Figure 16.29 (A) X-Ray, (B) PET Scan, (C) Sonogram, (D) CT Scan, (E) MRI Source: (A) Roentgen, W . (1896).

Read about the different medical imaging technologies; then label as many structures as you can identify in each of the images. Y ou may use other diagrams and pictures to help you identify the structures. X - rays: X - rays are high - energy electromag- netic radiation that penetrate soft tissues but are blocked by bone and other dense struc-tures. They provide silhouettes of bones and other structures, and are immensely valuable in orthopedics and other medical professions. Figure 16.29 A is one of the earliest X - rays recorded. It was made by Wilhelm Roentgen, the inventor of X - ray imaging, in 1896. Positron emission tomography (PET scan): Patients are injected with a short - lived radio-active isotope that is incorporated in a meta-bolically active molecule such as sugar. Once absorbed by tissues, positrons (the antipar-ticles of electrons) are emitted and detected by the scanner, providing an image of the tis-sues that have absorbed the carrier molecule. Figure 16.29 B is a PET scan showing a cancer-ous tumor in the brain. Sonography: Sonography is the imaging of structures with ultrasonic sound waves. Sound waves in excess of 20,000 Hz are projected into the body and refl ect off muscles, tendons, and other internal organs. The refl ected sound waves are received and interpreted graphically, as shown in Figure 16.29 C. Sonographs (known commonly as ultrasound images) are used to track fetal development. Figure 16.29 C is a son-ogram of a 14 - week - old human embryo. Computed tomography (CT scan): Computed tomography generates images of virtual \" slices \" of the body. CT scans integrate X - ray data from a variety of angles to generate a series of sectional images (Figure 16.29 D). With CT scans, the physician can see what the body looks like at a series of elevations or levels. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Magnetic resonance imaging allows physicians to exam-ine soft tissues. Images are created from the resonating magnetic elds of the hydrogen atoms within the water molecules of the body. Computer - generated images allow medical personnel to visualize soft tissues, such as the brain shown in Figure 16.29 E. ACTIVITY 16.4.5 Correcting Misconceptions in Science In 2001 a popular television network aired a pro-gram Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon ? This pseudodocumentary concluded that NASA faked the moon landing by taking pictures in the Nevada desert. Each of the following accu-sations was based on NASA photographs such as Figure 16.30 . Examine each of the following claims in the light of Figure 16.30 , and offer a plausi-ble explanation to rebut those who say the Moon landing was staged. 1. There is no atmosphere on the Moon, and therefore no wind, yet Figure 16.30 shows the fl ag fl ying, indicating that the photograph was taken on Earth. Figure 16.30 Astronaut Buzz Aldrin on the Moon, 1969 Source: Armstrong, N. (1969). Astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., lunar module pilot of the rst lunar landing mission, poses for a photo- graph beside the deployed United States Flag during an Apollo 11 extravehicular activity (EVA) on the lunar surface.

If a horizontal crossbeam supported the fl ag, the fabric would hang straight, but it appears to be fl uttering as it would in a breeze. There is no atmosphere on the Moon, so there are no breezes, indicating that the photograph was taken on Earth. 3. The shadows in the photograph are not paral- lel. Shadows are caused when objects intercept light. Since the Sun is very far from the Moon, the rays reaching the Moon are essentially parallel, and thus the shadows should be par-allel as well. The nonparallel shadows must be caused by the presence of additional lighting sources, such as those on a movie set. 4. No stars are visible even though the sky is black. Since there is no atmosphere on the Moon, there is no light and therefore no scattering of the light rays. The sky is therefore black during the daytime, and stars are visible even when the Sun is up. Since no stars are visible, the photo-graph could not have been taken on the Moon. ACTIVITY 16.4.6 Detecting Hoaxes Photo graphs can be misleading, particularly since the advent of digital photography and associated software such as Photoshop. A skillful graphic art-ist can easily alter photographs, so you should be particularly skeptical about unusual photographs you receive by e - mail or see on the Internet and in magazines. It used to be said that \" photographs don ' t lie, \" and although this statement was more accurate in the predigital era than now, photo-graphs have long been used to mislead and trick. Following is a list of classic hoaxes that fooled millions. Select one of the following images, and locate it on the Internet using a graphic search engine. Y ou may need to enter the name of the location or photographer, or both, in addition to the name of the photograph. Critique the photo-graph and suggest how it may have been made. 1 .

Jackalopes: A cross between jackrabbits and antelopes, popularized on postcards from Colorado and Wyoming starting in 1950. 3 .

Venusian spacecraft: A photograph of a fl ying saucer by George Adamski who claimed that he was visited by aliens from Venus in 1952. 16.5 Digital Movies and Animations Movies are an extremely useful tool in science and engineering. Figure 16.31 shows frames from the famous 1940 movie of the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. The bridge, over 1 mi in length, collapsed during a 42 mph windstorm just four months after construction was com-pleted. Scientists and engineers from the state of Washington and around the rest of the world intently studied this movie to understand the causes of the disaster. As a result of their nd- ings, designs for suspension bridges were forever altered, and there has been no comparable disaster with suspension bridges since. Movies such as those made of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse, the Challenger space shuttle explosion, the World Trade Center towers attack, and the assassination of John F. Kennedy have been studied extensively, and they have yielded information that has helped engineers and decision makers in their attempts to avert simi-lar calamities. Scientists have realized the value of movies, and today, digital video cameras are used in thousands of laboratories to record experiments and make observations. c16.indd 310 c16.indd 310 5/9/08 6:10:58 PM 5/9/08 6:10:58 PMDiagramming and Visualizing Problems in Science 311 Video editing software allows users to examine videos in great detail. Slow motion, single - frame viewing, and time - lapse photography are a few of the many techniques scientists use to study their subjects. NTSC video (the most common for-mat in the United States) is shot at approximately 30 frames per second. Therefore, each new frame represents the passing of an additional 1/30 of a second of time. PAL and SECAM formats shoot 25 frames per second, so if you use these formats, each frame represents an additional 1/25 of a sec-ond. Studies of motion and process are greatly simpli ed with the use of digital video. In this sec- tion students use a couple of powerful techniques to study scienti c phenomena. ACTIVITY 16.5.1 Observing High - Speed Acti vities Many interesting scienti c phenomena take place so fast that observers cannot fully appreciate or understand the process. Digital video technology allows users to record such events and replay them at greatly reduced speeds so they can be studied and understood. A favorite activity in the study of motion is the water rocket, pictured in Figure 16.32 . This activity requires two 2 L plastic bottles, a launch mechanism (available from many scienti c supply companies), and a bicycle pump. Water is placed in the rocket and the opening sealed with a one - way valve. A pump is used to increase the air pressure inside the container. Eventually the trigger string is pulled, releasing the water from the bottle. As the water is forced out, the bottle fl ies up, as one would predict by Newton ' s law of interaction: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Following is a set of instructions for constructing and videotaping a water rocket. Using scissors, cut the top off a plastic 2 L soda bottle, as shown in Figure 16.32 A. Place this end over the bottom of another empty bottle, packing the space between with old rags or simi-lar material to provide weight in the front of the rocket (16.32B). Tape this junction, and place a rubber stopper in the head of the bottle (16.32C). The rags and the stopper weight the tip and help the rocket fl y straighter. Carefully cut three ns out of the sides of the rst bottle, and seal them rmly to the sides of the rocket (Figure 16.32 D) using duct tape or other strong adhesive. The plastic ns will maintain some of their original curvature, and all three ns should be mounted so that the curves go in the same direction. It is easi-est to mount the ns by rst bending the bases 90 degrees and sealing them to the bottle using duct tape. The ns will cause the rocket to spin along the vertical axis. This same spinning motion is used to stabilize footballs and rifl e bullets in fl ight. Fill the rocket partially with water, and seal the mouth with a one - hole stopper tted with Figure 16.31 Scenes from the Tacoma Narrow Bridge Disaster, 1940 Source: Elliot, B. (1940).

Retrieved December 2006 from http://www.archive.org. c16.indd 311 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science a one - way ball valve, available through many supply companies (look on sciencesourcebook.com , or search \" soda bottle rocket launcher \" ). Firmly secure the guidance rods (wooden dowels or PVC pipe) around the rocket so it cannot tip over when the trigger is pulled (Figure 16.32 E). Make certain everyone leaves the launch site. Set the video camera on a tripod a long dis- tance from the launch site so it will be able to cap-ture the entire fl ight without panning. Make sure that something of known or measurable height is in the eld of view close to the rocket so that you will be able to make distance and height meas-urements. Set the video camera to Record. Put on goggles. Connect the valve using tubing to a tire pump. Stand to the side of the rocket, and pump to the desired pressure. Start with low pressure, and work up once you have an understanding for how far the rocket will fl y. Stand behind a tree, wall, or other form of protection, and pull the trigger line. The water will rush out of the mouth of the bottle, propelling the rocket along a parabolic trajectory. Caution: The bottle can easily fl y more than 100 m, so this activity should be performed under the supervision of an experienced teacher, and only in very large areas where no one else is around. Import the video into a computer equipped with video editing software. Examine the frames in which the rocket was airborne. Measure the horizontal distance ( d x ) and the vertical distance ( d y ) from the launch site for each frame. Such measurements can be made by comparing lengths with other things of known height or length, such as a tree, building, or the hash marks on a foot-ball eld. Plot vertical and horizontal distance as a function of time, remembering that each frame represents 1/30 of a second. Next, plot the vertical distance as a function of the horizontal distance. Does the rocket follow a parabolic trajectory? Use this setup to study the effect of reaction mass (the amount of water used), air pressure (the amount of pumping performed), rocket design (presence or absence of ns and nose cone), or elevation (the angle from which the rocket launched). Following is a list of high - speed processes that can be studied with the use of digital video. Some require a video - microscope. Speci c information on each of the following can be accessed on the Internet by searching for key terms.

Time - lapse pho-tography is the process of taking frames less fre-quently so that the process appears more rapid when played back. Figure 16.33 illustrates the growth of crystals as observed under a video microscope. Figure 16.33 A illustrates how such videos are cap-tured at a rate of 30 frames per second. If, however, frames are taken only three times a second (Figure 16.33 B), the resulting movie will compress the real action into one - tenth the time when it is played back (Figure 16.33 C). Many video cameras, espe-cially those used for microscopic photography, have time - lapse options. See your camera manual (avail-able on the manufacturer ' s Web site) for details. Make a time - lapse recording of a slow proc- ess such as one of those listed below. Select an appropriate time - lapse frame rate. The frame rate should be much slower for lengthy processes, such as seed germination or fruit rotting. Set the cam-era on a tripod where it is protected from wind, weather, and vibrations. It is often helpful to place an analogue clock in the eld of view to record the time of each frame. Study the movie when it is played back at normal speed and report what you learn from this movie that you would not have noticed without time - lapse photography.

Develop a brief video of an experiment, activity, science project, eld trip, or interview. Include explanatory sound and subtitles. Here are some ideas: Biology: Biology experiment, introduction to a local ecosystem, highlights of a local zoo or botanical garden, eld trip to a local biotech laboratory or university biology lab, behavior of a pet or wild animal, interview with a biolo-gist concerning his or her profession 1 10 20 301 10 20 30 1 10 20 30A B C Figure 16.33 Time-Lapse Photography for Analyzing Sourcebook for Teaching Science Chemistry: Chemistry experiment, eld trip to a re nery or chemical production facility, doc- umentary of a chemical pollution problem in your region, interview of a chemist or chemi-cal engineer about his or her profession Physics: Physics experiment, eld trip to an engineering rm or university physics research laboratory, interview with a physicist or engi-neer about his or her profession, documentary about a recent development or application in physics. Earth and space science: Local geology; cur- rent weather patterns and analysis; eld trip to a water treatment facility, weather station, land ll, or construction site; interview with a geologist, astronomer, environmental scientist, oceanographer, or meteorologist about his or her profession. ACTIVITY 16.5.4 Using Digital Video for Science Instruction Nielsen Media Research reported that in 2005, the average American watched an average of 4 hours and 32 minutes of television per day. 1 P u t another way, in 2005 the average American spent 28 percent of his or her waking life watching TV and videos. Even if the programming were decent or educational, which it rarely is, the sheer invest-ment of time poses serious social, mental, and health threats to the \" couch potatoes \" and \" vidi-ots \" who so indulge. Researchers have linked excessive television watching with obesity, 2 poor academic performance, and social dysfunction. 3 Students who spend large amounts of time in the passive environment of television are less likely to eat, exercise, study, and socialize appropriately. It is very clear that students do not need any more entertainment. Unfortunately, many students view videos in the classroom the way they use them at home: as entertainment, rather than as a learning experience. Students and teachers need to master the remote control so they can use appropriate sec-tions of videos for student - taught lessons or inter-active instruction. Figure 16.35 shows standard video controllers for digital media. Develop and present a 5 - to 10 - min lesson with excerpts from a digital movie. Add your own dialog and ques-tions to tie the clips together. Y ou may use a movie designed to teach science or a popular movie that incorporates science themes such as October Sky (an inspirational story of youth excelling in science) , Blue Planet (the natural history of the Geology of the Sierra Nevada ScenesMovies SoundsStillsTextEffects SpeedcontrolDigital Movie Project Science Class Figure 16.34 Digital Video Editing Provides Opportunities for Science Projects DIGITAL VIDEO 00:09:06 TITLE CHAPTERenter eject title menuPHYSICS OF SKIING EK BOOKMARK VIDEO CLIP00:47:32 FRICTION BOOKMARKA BC DE FG HI JK L MN Stephen Herr, Aspen COO Figure 16.35 Numerous Features of Digital Viewers for Use Problems in Science 315 world ' s oceans ), Planet Earth (the natural history of terrestrial and aquatic biomes), Apollo 13 (the heroic story of the crew of a Moon mission that ran into serious trouble) , March of the Penguins (the behavior and ecology of Antarctica ' s emperor penguins), or An Inconvenient Truth (the evidence of climate change). Y our lesson should demon-strate mastery of the techniques listed below. Minimize: The movie can be minimized to reveal other relevant documents or Web sites. Movie: Videos can be shown full screen or a portion thereof. It is often useful to show the video in partial screen so other applications can be viewed simultaneously. For example, you can write and display notes in a word processor adjacent to the movie being viewed. Time: Y ou can reference the precise time of a particular scene or sequence. Play/Pause: Use the Pause button to discuss important scenes or concepts and engage students in predictions. During the pause, students can make measurements or plot posi-tions of items on the screen. Stop: Stop the video when you have dealt with the key issues. Do not feel compelled to show the entire movie. Previous chapter/scan backward: It may be advantageous to show a scene multiple times to make sure that students understand key events and concepts. Next chapter/scan forward: Skip through mate- rial that is not relevant to your lesson. Volume: Turn off the sound so the teacher or students can narrate a clip. Slow motion: Use slow motion to analyze rap- idly occurring events such as a beating heart or a rocket launch. Step frame: This allows you to view key scenes one frame at a time, which is particularly valu-able for critical sequences such as cell division or a collision. Each frame represents 1/30 of second of real time. Subtitles/closed captioning: Turn on the closed captioning for hearing - impaired individu-als or English learners. Closed captioning allows English learners to see and hear words simultaneously, helping them to associate spoken and written language. Audio/alternate languages: Many videos are recorded in more than one language. Use this feature if you want learners to hear explana-tions in their native tongue so they can better understand the English explanations. Bookmark: This feature allows you to reference a speci c frame within the video. Bookmark key frames, and label and organize them in folders associated with your lessons. Video clips: The video clip feature de nes start and end times for video clips. These may be labeled and organized in the same manner as bookmarks so as to provide easy access for future lessons. ACTIVITY 16.5.5 Electronic Presentations The most effective way to learn something is to prepare a lesson and teach it. In this activity, stu-dents teach their peers with the aid of electronic presentation tools. Software such as PowerPoint makes it possible to integrate photos, text, movies, sound, and animation in electronic presentations (Figure 16.36 ). Although such presentations are potentially very helpful in science instruction, they are often overused or abused. Many students have Figure 16.36 Digital Slide Show for Science Topics c16.indd 315 5/9/08 6:11:02 PM 5/9/08 6:11:02 PM316 Sourcebook for Teaching Science suffered \" death by PowerPoint \" by being subjected to unending sequences of digital text with cute but useless transitions and special effects. Fortunately, electronic presentations can be very helpful if the following guidelines are adhered to. Prepare a pres-entation on a topic relevant to your curriculum, taking the following points into consideration. Guidelines for Preparing Electronic Presentations Use only key terms and phrases. Use a limited amount of text. Single words and brief phrases are easier to read, take notes on, and remem-ber than sentences or paragraphs. Make all text readable. The text should be large enough that everyone in the class can read and should be in a color that is easily seen against the background. Reveal text progressively. Animate text so it appears only when you are ready to discuss it. This allows your audience to track with your thoughts. Revealing all of the text at once may prevent you from asking relevant questions because the answers are already on the screen. Use clear graphics. Use graphics that illustrate your points and are large and clear enough that everyone in the class can see the details you describe. Resize graphics to conserve memory. Resize graphics so they are appropriate for the size of your display. Digital cameras and scanners produce les many times larger than neces- sary for projection. Large les require extra memory and may slow your computer. Provide notes. Provide users with notes that show the contents of your slides. Encourage students to add their own notes to the frame-work you have provided. Employ multimedia. Electronic presenta- tions should make use of text, graphics, mov-ies, sounds, animations, and Web links. Such resources should be relevant to your topic. Interact with your audience. The main cause of \" death by PowerPoint \" is that presenters do not interact with their audiences as they proceed dutifully from one slide to the next. Invite student comments, and write down key ideas on the screen, whiteboard, or overhead as you go. Master the navigation controls so you can access any slide, Web page or docu-ment as appropriate. Do not be constrained by the linear sequence in which your slides are arranged. Use the appropriate technology. Y our electronic presentation is not the teacher. Y ou are! Use it as a tool to illustrate your points. Skip slides that are unnecessary, and use other media as appropriate. The overhead, whiteboard, chalk-board, and digital visual presenter are gener-ally better than electronic presentations when illustrating equations and solving problems. Such media allow a more fl exible presentation and enable your students to see your thought processes as they develop rather than those you used when you made the slide show hours b e f o r e . 16.6 Extrapolation An extrapolation is an inference based on the assumption that trends continue beyond the set of data collected. Scientists often extrapolate from laboratory data to the real world. For example, cancer researchers cannot perform experiments on human subjects but can do so on laboratory rats and other animals. Such researchers may conclude that chemicals are carcinogenic to humans based solely on data collected from other laboratory animals. T o make such conclusions, it is neces-sary to extrapolate from the animals to the human population. ACTIVITY 16.6.1 Extrapolation Game Extrapolations can also be made from graphics or pictures. Figures 16.37 A to 16.37 X show common items viewed at 50 to 100 times magni cation. Each of these photographs contains clues (evi-dence) of its source. Search each photograph for clues, and extrapolate to the item photographed by matching with the objects listed below. Students or teachers can make their own extrapolation games or exercises with a handheld digital microscope. c16.indd 316 c16.indd 316 5/9/08 6:11:02 PM 5/9/08 6:11:02 PMDiagramming and Visualizing Problems in Science 317 Figure 16.37 Identify Each Common Item from Its Close-Up View Sourcebook for Teaching Science 16.7 Interactive Scienti c Simulations An interactive simulation is one in which the user can experiment by manipulating input vari-ables. A variety of software is available to design interactive simulations, and many science simula-tions are available on the Internet. Interactive sim-ulations are particularly useful in science because they allow students to visualize, manipulate, and experiment with concepts that cannot easily be observed. ACTIVITY 16.7.1 Teaching and Learning Science Concepts with Simulations Locate a simulation of a scienti c concept assigned by your teacher, and teach your study group or class the concept using the simulation and a data projec-tor. Tables 16.1 to 16.4 list a few of the many sci-ence concepts for which there are simulations and animations on the Internet (see sciencesourcebook. com or search for a \" simulation \" or \" animation \" of your topic). aphid on leaf appleBand-AidChex cerealcombplasma of leaf staplestopographic map watchwood Table 16.1 A Few of the Many Earth and Space Science Animations on the Internet aurora borealis carbon cyclecloud formationcoastal Table 16.2 A Few of the Many Biology Animations on the Internet cardiac cycle cell cyclecell energy cyclecountercurrent 6:11:05 PMDiagramming and Visualizing Problems in Science 319 Table 16.3 A Few of the Many Chemistry Animations on the Internet acid-base nuclear magnetic resonance oxidation pH analysis phase changes photoelectric effect reduction Rutherford experiment single replacement solubility spectral analysis stoichiometry titration X - ray crystallography Table 16.4 A Few of the Many Physics Animations on the Internet additive (1c) C, A, (3d), B; (4a) F. Note that the perpendicular force into the ramp exceeds the force exerted by the ramp on the box. Since the forces are unbalanced, the ramp will bend (accelerate) in the direction of the greater force. (4b) C. This is consid-ered a heavier box because the gravitational force, as represented by the F mg vector, is greater than it is for the lighter boxes, D, E, and F. Note that there is no fric-tional force acting to counter the accelerating force, F a . (4c) D. This is considered a lighter box because the gravitational force, represented by the F mg vector, is less than it is for the heavier boxes, A, B, and C. The accel-erating and frictional forces are balanced, and the per-pendicular and normal forces are balanced. (4d) E. One can see that the ramp is frictionless because there is no vector to counter the accelerating force, F a . (4e) A. This is considered a heavier box because the gravitational force, represented by the F mg vector, is greater than it is for the lighter boxes, D, E, and F. The accelerating and frictional forces are balanced, and the perpendicular and normal forces are balanced. (4f) B. This box will accelerate because the accelerating force, F a , exceeds the frictional force, F f . Frictional forces, F f , generate heat. 16.2.1 (1) Inside the focal length, as in Figure 16.7 F. (2) At two times the focal length, as in Figure 16.7 C. (3) Between the focal length and two times the focal length, as in Figure 16.7 D. (4) Beyond two times the focal length, as in Figure 16.7 B.

(3a) vary, but should succinctly and accurately illustrate the key concepts. 16.3.1 (1) The compass is mounted to the dashboard of a car driving east across the United States. The compass needle always points to magnetic north, which is in c16.indd 319 c16.indd 319 5/9/08 6:11:05 PM 5/9/08 6:11:05 PM320 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science northern Canada, rather than to the true North Pole, which is in the middle of the polar ice cap. The rst picture could represent a location on the West Coast (e.g., San Francisco, declination 14.7 \u00b0 ); the second a position in the middle of the country where the dec-lination is essentially zero because the car, magnetic pole, and geographic pole are on the same meridian (e.g., Cedar Rapids, Iowa, declination 0.2 \u00b0 ); and the third a city on the East Coast (e.g., Boston, declination /H11002 15.4 \u00b0 ). Alternatively, the movement of the compass needle could be the result of a magnet that is brought near to compass. (2) The wire is viewed in cross section and is part of a loop. X and Y represent the cross section of a wire that comes out of the plane of the paper, at X makes a U - turn, and then reenters the plane at Y. A magnetic eld is pro- duced when an electric current fl ows through the wire. The eld is always oriented the same way with respect to the wire. It is oriented opposite if the wire is bent and the current fl ows in the opposite direction. The circuit is open in the rst picture, so no current fl ows and no magnetic eld is generated. The circuit is closed in the second picture, allowing electricity to fl ow in one direc- tion and opposite magnetic elds to be generated in the two portions of wire that are going different directions. The current is reversed (as in an AC current) in the nal picture, causing a reversal of magnetic elds. (3) The cell is initially in an isotonic solution (A), but when placed in a hypotonic solution, the cell swells and breaks (B and C). (4) The cell is initially in an isotonic solution (A), but when placed in a hypertonic solution, the cell shrinks (B) before it is again placed in the original solution and resumes its shape (C). (5) The tail of the comet (A) grows under the infl uence of solar wind (B and C) as it approaches the Sun and shrinks as it moves away from the sun (D and E). (6) Figures 16.16 A and 16.16 B represent an aerial view of a highway that experienced a massive earthquake on a strike - slip fault. Figures 16.16 C and 16.16 D repre- sent a highway that experienced an earthquake along a reverse or compressional fault. The total distance has decreased due to compression. (7) (A) one nearby stationary object. (B) three nearby sta- tionary objects. (C) two nearby stationary objects, one of which is closer than the other. (D) one object that is moving toward the source. (E) one object moving away from the source. (F) one object moving toward the source and one moving away from the source. (8) (A) A person is excited, startled, or starts to exercise, leading to an increase in heart rate. (B) A person is sedated or stops exercising, leading to a decrease in heart rate. (C) A person suffers a heart attack, caus-ing the heart to stop beating. (D) A patient ' s heart is restarted following a heart attack. (9) (A) The dog is positioned closer to the elephant so that the center of mass for the system is on the left of the fulcrum. (B) The dog moves backward until the center of mass is directly above the fulcrum and the animals are balanced. (C) The dog continues to move back until the center of mass is to the right of the fulcrum, causing a net torque so the plank rotates to the right. (10) Growth and development occur between A and B. The rst diagram (A) is a picture of a fetal skeleton scaled up to the size of an adult skeleton. The second skeleton (B) is a mature human skeleton. 16.3.2 Student answers may vary, depending on the criteria they select. The following are common answers, but the teacher should also give credit for other reason-able answers. (A) A penguin. (2) is a bird; the others are mammals. (B) The living fern (3) is not a fossil; the others are. (C) The insect (2) has six legs; the oth-ers are spiders with eight legs. (D) The buckeye (2) is not an oak and does not produce acorns. (E) The shark (3) has a backbone; the others do not. (F) The whale (2) is a mammal; the others are bony or cartilaginous sh. (G) The clamshell (4) is a bivalve shell; the others are helical (spiral). (H) The cabbage (2) is a vegetable; the others are fruits. (I) The carrots (1) are vegetative; the others are reproductive parts. (J) The pine (5) is a gymnosperm; the others are angiosperms. 16.3.3 (A) Granite is a plutonic, igneous rock and should be found at the bottom of the pro le rather than the top. (B) Mountains cause winds to rise, cooling air and causing precipitation. Forests are typically found on the wind-ward rather than the leeward sides of mountain ranges, and rain shadow deserts are found on the leeward sides rather than the windward. (C) The ball should travel straight (tangential to the move- ment) when the string is cut. When the string is cut, there is no remaining force to create a curved path. (D) This illustrates the stages of metamorphosis in a moth. The larvae (caterpillar) and pupa stages (stages 2 and 3) should be switched. (E) The 50 kg mass has much more inertia than the 10 kg mass. The 10 kg mass should therefore bounce back- ward off the more massive 50 kg mass. (F) Conservation of momentum dictates that the momen- tum following a collision should be the same as the momentum preceding a collision. Since the heights of the balls are the same, one can assume they are mov-ing at similar speeds away from each other; in fact, the smaller one should be moving much faster than the larger one for momentum to be conserved. (G) In a frictionless system, a ball could roll to reach the same elevation it started from, but would have no remaining kinetic energy to complete the loop. A roller - coaster loop must always be lower than the start-ing point if it is driven only by gravity. (H) Newton ' s law of interaction states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When the mass is suspended in the beaker, its weight decreases, and the weight on the balance must therefore increase by an equal amount, but this is not shown in the picture. c16.indd 320 c16.indd 320 5/9/08 6:11:06 PM 5/9/08 6:11:06 PMDiagramming and Visualizing Problems in Science 321 (I) One parent is homozygous recessive, and the other is heterozygous. They can therefore produce white or colored fl owers, but not fl owers with alternating petal color. (J) Newton ' s law of interaction states that for every action, there is an equal and opposing reaction. The gun should recoil to the left as the bullet fl ies to the right. (K) Zebras are native to Africa, and bison are native to North America. They would not be seen in the same photograph unless in a zoo. (L) The angles of the blocks appear to be right angles (90 \u00b0 ), but it would be impossible for three such blocks to form a closed gure as shown since the sum of the angles would have to be 360 \u00b0 , when the sum of three right angles is only 270 \u00b0 . (M) Snow crystals have six sides, but one of those illustrated has eight. It has been said that every snowfl ake has a unique shape. Although this cannot be proven, we do know that they are generally different, yet two in this picture have the same shape. 16.4.1 (1) The birds fl ying to the right of the space shuttle indicate the Earth can support living systems. (2) The sky is completely black even though the Sun is shining. This occurs because there is no atmosphere to scatter or refract light. (3) The huge exhaust clouds from the space shuttle engines and solid rocket boosters indi-cate great force is required for lift - off. (4) It appears as though the astronauts can fl oat in any position. The tail n of the space shuttle appears to be upside down, an orientation that makes sense only if the passengers are weightless. (5) Space appears dark black, indicat-ing that there is no atmosphere to scatter light. (6) The astronauts are wearing protective suits that isolate them from the environment of the Moon, presumably because it is inhospitable for life. (7) The lunar surface appears devoid of life, and there are no visible erosion channels. (8) The astronaut is wearing a larger suit and carrying a larger backpack than he would be able to carry comfortably on Earth. (9) The sky is not black, indicating that there is an atmosphere to scatter or refl ect light. 16.4.2 (1) North. The stars appear to be rotating around the North Star (Polaris), a star that is aligned with the Earth ' s axis or rotation. (2) One hour. The arcs left by the stars represent approximately 1/24 of a circle. Since there are 24 hours in a day, each 1/24 of an arc represents 1 hour. (3) Mountains. The trees appear to be conifers such as pines, rs, or spruces. Such trees are commonly found in the mountains, but not in the desert or tropics, or in a planetarium. Although conifers may be found in the city, it is unlikely that a photograph in the city would show so many stars due to light pollution. 16.4.3 (1) The white mass in the left lung is probably can- cerous. (2) The stripe of larger cells is cancerous. (3) The white area in the back of the brain represents the tumor. 16.4.4 Following is a list of some of the prominent features that can be identi ed in the images: (1) X - ray: rst and second metacarpals; proximal, middle, and distal phalanges. (2) PET scan: left cerebral hemisphere, right cerebral hemisphere. (5) sonogram: eyes, nose, mouth, teeth, forehead, brain, shoulder. (3) CT scan: ventri-cles, skull, cerebral hemisphere, convolutions of the cerebrum. (4) MRI scan: eyes, optic nerves, ventricles, cerebrum, central sulcus. 16.4.5 (1) The fl ag is supported by a horizontal beam to give the appearance of fl ying in the breeze. (2) The fl ag is not made from cotton or other fabrics com- monly found in fl ags on Earth. It is made of a stiff fab- ric that became crinkled when stored in a tube on the way to the Moon. Gravity on the Moon is only one - sixth that on Earth and is insuf cient to straighten out the creases in the fl ag. (3) Photographs are two - dimensional representations of a three - dimensional world. Flattening images causes dis-tortions, and similar nonparallel distortions are found in photographs taken on Earth.

T o cor- rectly expose the lm, the aperture must be small and the shutter speed fast. Under such conditions, the sur-face of the Moon and the astronaut will be correctly exposed, but dim objects, like the stars, will be under-exposed and not show in the picture. 16.4.6 Student answers will vary. 16.5.1 - 16.5.4 Students develop various digital multimedia projects. 16.6.1 (A) Band - Aid, (B) staples, (C) screw, (D) paper clip, (E) key, (F) cotton shirt, (G) Chex cereal, (H) comb, (I) nger, (J) daisy, (K) hair, (L) topographic map, (M) stalk (petiole) of leaf, (N) newspaper photograph, (O) salt, (P) apple, (Q) wood, (R) aphid on leaf, (S) plasma display, (T) penny, (U) watch, (W) football, (X) jeans. c16.indd 321 c16.indd 321 5/9/08 6:11:07 PM 5/9/08 6:11:07 PM322Chapter Seventeen Dimensional Analysis For the Teacher 322 17.1 Unit Measures 326 17.2 Fundamental Quantities 329 17.3 SI and Non - SI Units 333 17.4 CGS and MKS Units 334 17.5 Discovering Physical Laws Using Fundamental Units 335 17.6 Simplifying Calculations with the Line Method 337 17.7 Solving Problems with Dimensional Analysis 339 Answers to Chapter Activities 346 For the Teacher Many teachers tell their students to solve word problems by \" thinking logically \" and checking their answers to see if they \" look reasonable.\" Although such advice sounds good, it doesn ' t translate into good problem solving. What does it mean to \" think logically \" ? How many people ever get an intuitive feel for a coulomb, joule, volt, or amp? How can any student con dently solve prob- lems and evaluate solutions intuitively when the problems involve such abstract concepts as moles, calories, or newtons? T o become effective problem solvers, students need to develop sound problem - solving techniques and strategies. The most useful problem - solving technique in science is dimensional analysis, also known as factor - label method and unit analysis. Dimensional analysis is a general problem - solving method that uses the dimensions (units) associ-ated with numbers as a guide in setting up and checking calculations. It is a consistent and pre-dictable technique, yet many teachers are not expe-rienced enough with the technique to teach others. If you are not comfortable with your ability to use or teach dimensional analysis, work through the exercises in this chapter, paying particular atten-tion to section 17.7, which has numerous sample problems. Students learn well by seeing patterns in examples, so you will be wise to photocopy the sample problems and give them to your students as a reference. c17.indd 322 c17.indd 322 5/9/08 6:06:32 PM 5/9/08 6:06:32 r minutes minutes hourorhour 60 miu/H11005 /H11005/H11005nnutes According to the identity property of multipli- cation, anything can be multiplied by 1 without changing its value. Therefore, you can multiply by conversion factors as needed to adjust units, with-out concern of changing values. Dimensional analysis uses what is known to determine what is unknown. It is necessary to establish an equation that shows how the unknown is related to the knowns. Customarily, one places the units of the unknown on the right side of the equa-tion and manipulates the knowns on the left side to determine the value of the unknown. Conversion factors are used to ensure that the units on both sides of the equation are equal. Before calculating the unknown, make cer- tain that the units on the left side of the equation are equivalent to those on the right. If the units are not equivalent, the setup is either incomplete or incorrect, and you must reexamine the known side and manipulate the setup as necessary to get the desired units. When working to balance units, make certain to keep all conversion factors and formulas intact, even if inverted. For example, if an equation involves the use of the 60 min/hour conversion factor, you can multiply by (60 min/hr) or (hr/60 min), but not by (1/60 min/hr). Once the units on the left side equal those on the right, you may proceed with calculations. An example from physiology illustrates dimen- sional analysis. If the average heart rate is 72 beats per minute, approximately how many times will a heart beat in a year (Figure 17.1 )? 1 . Unknown: An analysis of the problem shows that the unknown (the estimated average number of heartbeats per year) must have units of beats/year. 2 . Knowns: We know that the average heart rate is 72 beats/min. 3 . Conversion factors and formulas: To co nve r t minutes to years, we will need the following conversion factors: 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1 day is equal to 24 hours, and 1 year is equal If teachers are not consistent in their use of units, students will not be either. Many teachers forget to use units when solving problems for their students, and this gives students license to do the same. T o avoid this problem, consider awarding students extra credit for catching you each time you omit units in a measurement or calculation. Dimensional analysis is predicated on the fact that all measurable quantities have dimensions (units). T o specify that the speed of light is 3.0 /H11003 10 8 is meaningless. Is it 3.0 /H11003 10 8 miles/hour, 3.0 /H11003 10 8 kilometers/second, or /H11003 10 8 fathoms/fort- night?! The number 3.0 /H11003 10 8 has no inherent meaning. However, when we specify that the speed of light is 3.0 /H11003 10 8 meters/second, we provide all the information necessary to compare it with the speed of other things and solve equations that involve the speed of light. Before solving a problem, make certain that all numbers have units, with the exception of the following: trigonometric functions (e.g., sine, cosine, tangent), logarithms, and certain special numbers such as e and /H9266 . Just as a golfer searches for the fl ag of the next hole before teeing off, so the experienced prob-lem solver determines the dimensions of the nal answer (the unknown ) before solving a problem. If you do not know the desired units of your answer, you will be like a golfer who tees off before deter-mining the location of the next hole. The likeli-hood that either of you will achieve your goal is slight. Once you have identi ed the desired units of the answer (the unknown ), list the values and units of all things that you do know (the knowns ). If appropriate, draw a diagram of the problem, and label the parts with the appropriate units. Examine the units of the knowns and unknown, and specify all relevant conversion factors and formulas. For example, if your answer has units that include hours and your known values are expressed only in minutes, you will need the conversion factor, 60 minutes /H11005 1 hour. Without conversion factors, it may be impossible to express answers in the desired units. Conversion factors can be expressed as ratios with a value of 1. For example, since 60 minutes is the same time as 1 hour, the ratio or 60 minutes/hour or 1 hour/60 minutes is equal to 1: 6:06:34 PM 5/9/08 6:06:34 PM324 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science to 365 days. Since conversion ratios are always equal to one (1 /H11005 60 min/h; 1 /H11005 24 h/d; 1 /H11005 365 d/y), you can multiply by them, or divide by them (invert and multiply) without chang-ing values. 4 . Equation: The units of the unknown (beats/ year) are the target units and are placed on the right side of the equation. The left side of the equation is arranged so that units cancel, leaving an answer expressed in the tar-get units. 5 . Calculation: After the units are canceled, the equation yields the answer in beats/year. Activity 17.1.1 (The Hazards of Not Using Units) illustrates the importance of using units. Students will struggle to complete part B because of the absence of units. Although they may be able to make reasonable inferences, they will experi-ence dif culty and uncertainty due to the ambigu- ity inherent in dimensionless values. Activity 17.2.1 (Different Units for the Same Quantity) can be performed as a pretest and post-test in a unit on problem solving. Most students have never heard of some of the units in this activ-ity but can still make logical inferences. For exam-ple, since \" candela \" sounds like \" candle, \" it may be inferred to be a measure of luminous (light) intensity. Similarly, \" sidereal day \" (the time it takes for the Earth to make one complete revolution in relation to a given star; equal to 23 hours, 56 min-utes, 4.1 seconds), may be inferred as a measure of time because it contains the word day. Many students experience dif culty with dimensional analysis because there are multi-ple units for the same quantity. For example, the quantity \" length \" can be measured in centim-eters, nanometers, miles, inches, feet, fathoms, \u00c5 ngstroms, microns, kilometers, yards, light - years, femtometers, mils, or astronomical units. Table 17.1 may be used to illustrate that the same quantity can be measured in many different units.

The astute student may look at the answers to this activity and notice that the original SI de nition of mass required a measurement of length (a kilogram is the mass of 1 cubic decimeter of water), and the original SI de nition of length required a measurement of time (a meter is the length of a pendulum hav-ing a period of 1/2 second) . The original SI unit of time, however, was not as intuitive, de ned as 1/86,400 of the mean solar day. T o integrate history and science, you may wish to show that the customary (English) sys-tem measurements of length was rooted in natural dimensions of the adult human body. Although such measurements were approximate, they were easy to conceptualize. For example, the inch rep-resented the average width of an adult thumb, the foot was the length of an average adult male foot, the yard approximated the distance from the tip of the nose to the end of the middle nger, the fathom was the total arm span, and the mile was the length of 1000 paces (where a pace was de ned as two steps). If students are not familiar with a unit name, they may rush to a dictionary to identify it. I suggest that you rst encourage them to talk in groups to see if they can gure out the answers based on their collective experi-ence. English language learners may to do better if they realize that some of the terms have cognates (words with same etymological roots and similar sounds) in their native languages. For example, kil- ometer in English is chilometro in Italian, kil \u00f3 metro in Spanish, kilom \u00e8 tre in French, and Kilometer in German. Activity 17.4.1 (Converting CGS Units to MKS Units) illustrates the power of dimensional analy-sis in understanding important laws and princi-ples. Dimensional analysis with fundamental units helps students see the simplicity and elegance of the physical world by showing that everything that is measurable can be expressed as a combination of just seven fundamental units. A manipula-tion of these units reveals numerous relationships and promotes a deeper understanding of science. Students who are adept at dimensional analysis with fundamental units are able to understand and derive relationships that others blindly memorize. An analysis of the equations derived in this activ-ity reveals important relationships in the physical world. For example, C /H11005 Q/V is a de nition of capacitance, V /H11005 IR is a statement of Ohm ' s law of resistance, P /H11005 W/t is a de nition of power, and P /H11005 I 2 R is an expression of the power expended in a circuit. After deriving these equations by dimen-sional analysis, students will have a better under-standing of the relationship between physical quantities. Show your students that the nal four equa- tions in this activity are all expressions of energy: E /H11005 Fd; E /H11005 W; E /H11005 mv 2 ; E /H11005 mad. The product of force and distance has units of energy ( E /H11005 Fd ), indicating that energy is the capacity to move a force through a distance or, more speci cally, energy is the capacity to do work ( E /H11005 W ). The product of mass and speed squared has units of energy ( E /H11005 mv 2 ), which helps one understand why the kinetic energy of an object can be expressed as 1/2 mv 2 (where m is mass and v is velocity), while the energy obtained by the conversion of mass to energy in a nuclear reaction ( E /H11005 mc 2 , where c is the speed of light) has the same units. Energy is one of the cen-tral themes of science, and dimensional analysis of fundamental units can be used to show how and where it occurs in equations and relationships. Activity 17.5.1 (Discovering Key Equations with Dimensional Analysis) encourages science teachers and students to communicate using standard MKS - SI units rather than CGS - SI or customary (English) units. Table 17.2 has been included to aid the conversion of cgs to mks units. Activity 17.6.1 (Dimensional Analysis with the Line Method) introduces a simpli ed approach for dimensional analysis that reduces the amount of writing and the potential for error. Make cer-tain students understand that the \" line method \" is simply a formatting technique and does not repre-sent a difference in the mathematics. Activity 17.7.1 (Solving Problems in Everyday Life with Dimensional Analysis) is the culminating activity in this chapter and stresses the importance of solving problems with this technique. The problems at the beginning of each set are simpler c17.indd 325 c17.indd 325 5/9/08 6:06:35 PM 5/9/08 6:06:35 PM326 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science than those at the end. I have included problems from everyday life, biology, chemistry, earth and space science, and physics to illustrate the importance of dimensional analysis throughout the sciences. Although it may be tempting to photocopy the solutions and project them during instruction, I encourage you to solve each problem in class from scratch. There are many potential sequences by which each problem may be solved, so don ' t be concerned if the sequences you use differ from those shown here. The important issue is that the units cancel to leave only the desired units. Please note that some conversion values are precise and therefore have an unlimited number of signi cant digits. For example, there are precisely 10 millimeters in 1 centimeter, so the 10 mm/cm conversion ratio does not limit the number of sig-ni cant gures in any calculation. Failing to clar- ify this issue can cause confusion among students who are trying to express answers in the right number of signi cant units. The following exam- ple may help clarify this situation: The product of 25 cm and 2.000 cm is 50 cm 2 , not 50.00 cm 2 . Since there are only two signi cant digits in the rst multiplier, there can be no more than two in the answer. By con-trast, the product of 2.000 cm and 10 mm/cm is 20.00 mm. Note that the conversion factor (10 mm/cm) is precise (based on the de nition of a millimeter), has unlimited signi cant dig- its, and therefore does not reduce the number of signi cant digits in the answer. Students may get lazy or overcon dent and try to solve problems without dimensional analysis. T o impress the importance of dimensional analy-sis, you may post a \" warning \" in your room such as illustrated in Figure 17.2 . 17.1 Unit Measures On September 24, 1999, the New York Times declared: \" Mars Orbiting Craft Presumed Destroyed by Navigation Error. \" 1 The article explained, \" A $ 125 million robotic spacecraft, the rst ever dispatched especially to investigate weather on Table 17.2 CGS and MKS Units CGS Unit Measuring SI (MKS) Equivalent barye (ba) pressure 0.1 pascal (Pa) biot (Bi) electric current 10 amperes (A)calorie (cal) heat energy 4.1868 joule (J )dyne (dyn) force 10 /H110025 newton (N) erg (erg) work, energy 10/H110027 joule (J) franklin (Fr) electric charge 3.3356 /H11003 10/H1100210 coulomb (C) galileo (Gal) acceleration 0.01 meter second squared (m\u00b7s/H110022 ) gauss ampere-turns per meter poise (P) dynamic viscosity 0.1 pascal second (Pa\u00b7s) Warning!

Lockheed Martin Corporation in Colorado sent daily course adjustments to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena with numbers that should have included customary (English) units of pound - seconds to describe the impulse necessary to adjust the course of the spacecraft into orbit around Mars. Unfortunately the engineers at JPL assumed these numbers speci ed impulse in newton - seconds. \" Since a newton - second is only 0.225 pound - second, the rocket motors were given only 22.5% the impulse needed to alter the orbit appropriately, and it is presumed that the craft plummeted into the Red Planet. If engineers had included or checked units, this disaster could have been avoided. \" Using the correct units is important not only for scientists and engineers but for people in all walks of life. The Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimates that medication errors cause at least one death every day and injure approximately 1.3 million people annually in the United States. It cites errors in medical abbrevia-tions or writing, including the absence of dimen-sions (units), as one of the chief causes for these problems. According to the National Academy of Sciences ' Institute of Medicine, drug complications in the hospital are the leading cause of medical mis-takes in America, accounting for nearly 20 percent of all errors. The institute ' s study, To Err Is Human: Building a Better Health System, reported that 2 out of every 100 hospital admissions experienced a \" preventable adverse drug event. \" 2 The Institute of Medicine study estimated that the cost of prescrip-tion errors was $ 2 billion annually. Some of these costly errors can be avoided if physicians, pharma-cists, and consumers indicate and check units. ACTIVITY 17.1.1 The Hazards of Not Using Units Much confusion is caused when measurements are reported without units, as you will see in the following incomplete statements. Examine each statement, and make your best guess of the correct units. 1 . Medication: A typical adult prescription of the painkiller acetaminophen with codeine is 500 . (a) tablets, (b) grams, (c) milligrams, (d) ounces, (f) milliliters Consequences of being incorrect: Symptoms of overdose may include cold and clammy skin, extreme sleepiness progressing to stupor or coma, general bodily discomfort, heart attack, kidney fail-ure, liver failure, low blood pressure, muscle weak-ness, nausea, slow heartbeat, sweating, and vomiting. 2 . Speed limit: The speed limit in school zones in Canada is 30 . (a) miles/hour, (b) kilometers/hour, (c) feet/second, (d) meters/second, (e) yards/second Consequences of being incorrect: Speeding in a school zone may result in an accident or a signi - cant ne. 3 . Bicycle tire pressure: The recommended air pressure in many mountain bike tries is 6 0 . (a) pascals, (b) kilopascals, (c) pounds per square inch, (d) torr, (e) milimeters mercury Consequences of being incorrect: Underinfl ated tires puncture more easily, wear out faster, are more dif cult to pedal, and don ' t stop as ef - ciently. Overinfl ated tires m ay blow out. 4 . Dietetics: Many physicians recommend that pregnant women take no more than 10,000 of vitamin A per day. (a) grams, (b) milligrams, (c) ounces, (d) international units, (5) microliters Consequences of being incorrect: Excess vita- min A may give rise to birth defects, dry skin, scaly c17.indd 327 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science skin, headaches, fatigue, painful bones, and loss of appetite. 5 . Food storage: Food scientists recommend that produce companies store apples, cherries, apricots, and most berries at 2 . (a) degrees Fahrenheit, (b) kelvin, (c) degrees Celsius, (d) degrees Rankine, (e) degrees Reaumur Consequences of being incorrect: Storing these fruits at too high a temperature will result in eth-ylene production and early ripening. Storing them at too low of a temperature will damage the integ-rity of the fruit. 6 . Your example: Develop a hypothetical prob- lem that may arise when units are omitted in a eld such as sportscasting, international trade, or an area of your choice. ACTIVITY 17.1.2 Units in Everyday Life In the statements that follow, you will nd a variety of interesting facts, but each is missing a crucial piece of information: the units (dimen-sions)! All the statements are meaningless until supplied with the appropriate units. Complete the following statements using the units in Table 17.3 , using whatever resources you wish. In most, you will need to draw logical inferences. 1 . Coldest place in the known universe. The Boomerang Nebula, a cloud of dust and gas dispensed by a \" white dwarf, \" is one of the coldest places in the known universe, with an estimated temperature of /H11002 521.6 . 2 . Deepest lake. The deepest lake in the world is Lake Baikal, in Siberia, Russia. The lake has a depth of 15,371 , of which 3875 are below sea level. Baikal contains one - fth of all the world ' s fresh surface water. The lake has a surface area of 12,200 square . 3 . Highest G - force endured by an animal. The click beetle ( Athous haemorrhoidalis ) moves its body in a snapping fashion to gener-ate lift at a record - breaking acceleration of 400 . The beetle jumps this way to avoid predators and can leap up to 15 high. By comparison, humans can endure brief periods of up to 6 . 4 . Fastest dive by a bird. A peregrine falcon can reach a velocity of 350 when div-ing toward its prey. 5 . Driest place on earth. The meteorological sta- tion in Quillagua, in the Atacama Desert, Chile, records an average annual rainfall at just 0.5 . 6 . Greatest temperature range on Earth. The greatest recorded temperature variation is in Verkhoyansk, Siberia. The temperature is as high as 105 in the summer and as low as /H11002 6 8 \u00b0 C t o 3 7 i n the winter. 7 . Fastest avalanche. The volcanic explosion of Washington State ' s Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980, triggered an avalanche with a veloc-ity of 250 . 8 . Farthest object visible by the unaided eye. The most remote object visible with the unaided eye is the Great Galaxy in the constellation of Table 17.3 Units for Activity 17.1.2 Analysis 329 Andromeda. The Great Galaxy is composed of approximately 200,000,000,000 stars and is 2,200,000 from Earth. 9 . Most powerful nuclear explosion. The most powerful thermonuclear device ever tested was the Soviet Union ' s Tsar Bomba, with an explosive force equivalent to that of 57 of TNT. The shock waves from the 1961 blast circled the Earth three times. 1 0 . Tallest living tree. The tallest tree currently standing is the Mendocino tree, a coast redwood ( Sequoia sempervirens ) at Montgomery State Reserve, California. When measured, its height was determined to be 112.014 . 1 1 . Wood and paper use. The average amount of wood and paper consumed per person each year in America is equivalent to a tree tall and 16 diameter. 1 2 . Largest forest. The boreal forests of northern Russia, lying between latitude 55 N and the Arctic Circle, cover a total area of 2.7 billion . 1 3 . Longest venomous snake. The king cobra ( Ophiophagus hannah ) from Southeast Asia and India grows to an average length of 3.6 to 4.5 meters (12 - 15 feet)! It is estimated that 2 fl uid of a king cobra ' s venom can kill 20 people. 1 4 . Largest bird. The largest bird is the North African ostrich. It can grow to 2.75 tall and weigh 156.5 . The ostrich is also the fastest bird on land, reaching speeds o f 7 2 . 1 5 . Greatest snowfall for a snowstorm. In February 1959, a single snowstorm dropped 480 of snow at Mount Shasta Ski Bowl, California. 17.2 Fundamental Quantities One of the greatest inventions of all time is the alphabet, a set of symbols representing the basic sounds (phonemes) of spoken words. English and many other languages use the Latin alpha-bet, which developed from the Greek alphabet (Figure 17.3 ), which in turn developed from the ancient Phoenician alphabet. A comparison of these alphabets illustrates a common heritage. In an alphabetic writing system such as English, each letter represents a consonant or a vowel rather than a syllable or concept. Since alphabetic characters represent the most basic fea-tures of speech, only a small number are necessary to code the entire lexicon of a language. Although English has the largest vocabulary of any other language, the entire lexicon can be expressed using just the 26 characters of the alphabet. By contrast, languages that are based on larger units, such as syllables or concepts, are much more complex. Chinese, for example, employs a logographic writ-ing system in which characters are used to rep-resent the basic words of the Chinese language. There are approximately 40,000 Chinese charac-ters, of which nearly 2000 must be memorized to be functionally literate. The beauty and power of an alphabetic sys- tem is that it is based on the most fundamental linguistic units. From these fundamental units, one can derive any term in the spoken language. In a similar manner, there are fundamental units of measurement from which all other units of measurement are derived. Just as comprehen-sion of the Latin alphabet is necessary to read and write English, so comprehension of the \" scienti c alphabet \" is essential to understand the language of science. There are seven \" letters \" in the \" language of measurement \" from which all units of measure-ment are derived: distance, mass, time, electric cur- rent, temperature, amount, and luminous intensity (see Table 17.4 ). These are known as the funda- mental quantities because they cannot be expressed AA BB CC DD EELatin, EnglishClassical GreekPhonecian Early Greek Figure 17.3 of the 329 c17.indd 329 5/9/08 6:06:38 PM 5/9/08 6:06:38 PM330 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science in a simpler fashion. All other measurable quanti- ties are known as derived quantities because they can be derived by combining two or more funda-mental quantities. Length ( distance ) is a fundamental quantity because it can be expressed in no simpler terms than length. Volume is a derived quantity because it can be expressed as the cube of length. For exam- ple, when you measure the volume of a box, you multiply its length by its width by its height. The resulting measure is expressed as length cubed ( length 3 ) such as cubic feet or cubic centimeters. Density is considered a derived unit because it can be expressed in terms of the fundamental quanti-ties of mass and length ( density /H11005 mass/length 3 ). In 1960 the Eleventh General Conference on Weights and Measures adopted the International System of measurement ( SI ) and assigned base units for each physical quantity. 3 Table 17.4 shows some common physical quantities and their SI units. The rst seven (bold type) are the seven fundamental units, and the remaining are derived Table 17.4 Physical Quantities and Their SI Units Quantity Symbol SI Measurement Units Symbol Unit Dimensions distance d meter m m mass m kilogram kg kg time t second s s electric current I ampere A A temperature T kelvin K K amount n mole mol mol luminous intensity I candela cd cd acceleration a meter per second squared m/s2m/s2 area A square meter m2m2 capacitance C farad F A2\u00b7s4/kg\u00b7m2 concentration [C] molar M mol/m3 density D kilogram per cubic meter kg/m3kg/m3 electric charge Q coulomb C A\u00b7s electric eld intensity E newton per coulomb kg\u00b7m/A\u00b7s3 electric resistance R ohm V kg\u00b7m2/A\u00b7s3 energy E joule J kg\u00b7m2/s2 force F newton N kg\u00b7m/s2 frequency f hertz Hz s/H110021 heat Q joule J square magnetic fl ux weber Wb kg\u00b7m2/A\u00b7s2 potential difference V volt V kg\u00b7m2/A\u00b7s3 power P watt W kg\u00b7m2/s3 pressure p pascal (newton per square meter)Pa kg/m\u00b7s2 velocity v meter per second m/s m/s volume V cubic meter m3m3 work W joule J kg\u00b7m2/s2 Note: Fundamental units are in bold 330 5/9/08 6:06:39 PM 5/9/08 6:06:39 PMDimensional Analysis 331 from these. Table 17.5 provides de nitions of the fundamental units. Originally units were de ned in more understandable terms but had to be rede ned to acquire permanent and precise values. For exam-ple, originally a meter was de ned to represent one ten - millionth of the circumference of the Earth, from the North Pole to the equator, through Paris. Although such de nitions were easier to visualize than newer de nitions \u2014 a meter is now de ned as the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/(299 792 458) of a sec-ond \u2014 they were less precise and constant. ACTIVITY 17.2.1 Different Units for the Same Quantity Although there are only seven fundamental quan-tities, many ways have been developed to measure these quantities, making things seem much more complex than they really are. For example, Daniel Fahrenheit, the German physicist who invented the alcohol thermometer, developed a tempera-ture scale that took as zero the temperature of an equal ice - salt mixture and selected the values of 30 \u00b0 F and 90 \u00b0 F for the freezing point of water and normal body temperature, respectively. (Later, the temperatures of freezing water and body tempera-ture were revised to 32 \u00b0 F and 98.6 \u00b0 F.) In 1742 the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius developed a competing temperature scale in which 0 \u00b0 C was de ned as the freezing point and 100 \u00b0 C as the boiling point of water. In addition, Ren \u00e8 Reamur, William Rankine, and William Thompson (Lord Kelvin) developed temperature scales that now bear their names. Despite the different names Table 17.5 De nitions of the Units of the Seven Fundamental Quantities Quantity SI Unit De nition of Unit distance meter (m) The meter is the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second. mass kilogram (kg) The kilogram is equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram. time second (s) The second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyper ne levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom. electric current ampere (A) The ampere is that constant current that, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of in nite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 meter apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2 /H11003 10 /H110027 newton per meter of length. temperature kelvin (K) The kelvin is the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water. amount of substance mole (mol) The mole is the amount of substance of a system that contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kilogram of carbon 12. intensity of light candela (cd) The candela is the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 /H11003 10 12 and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian.

Anyone who assumes that different unit names measure different physical quantities can become confused. The terms in Table 17.6 are units for measuring the seven fundamental quan-tities of length, mass, time, temperature, current, luminous intensity, and quantity. Examine the list, and classify each term as a measure of one of these seven fundamental quantities. 333 17.3 SI and Non - SI Units Some of the most commonly measured quantities in science are distance, mass, time, temperature, volume, density, pressure, amount, concentration, energy, velocity, molarity, and electric charge. All of these quantities can be measured in a variety of ways. For example, distance can be measured in centimeters, nanometers, miles, inches, feet, fath-oms, \u00c5 ngstroms, microns, kilometers, yards, light - years, femtometers, and mils. Specialized circumstances often call for spe- cialized units. For example, interstellar distances are measured in light - years (the distance between our Sun and the next nearest star, Proxima Centurai, is 4 light - years) while intermolecular bond lengths are measured in \u00c5 ngstroms (the dis-tance between hydrogen and oxygen in water is 0.958 \u00c5 ). Although light - years and \u00c5 ngstroms are both measures of distance, many assume they are unrelated. In an effort to minimize confusion, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemists (IUPAC) recommended that all quantities be measured in SI units (e.g., meters) or multiples of SI units (e.g., femtometers, nanometers, microm-eters, millimeters, centimeters, and kilometers). Despite growing acceptance of the SI system, many other measurement units continue to be used, among them miles, inches, feet, fathoms, \u00c5 ngstroms, microns, yards, light - years, and mils. ACTIVITY 17.3.1 Where Did the SI Base Units Come From? During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, great advances in science and technology led to a variety of overlapping systems of measure-ments as scientists and engineers improvised to meet the needs of their individual disciplines. T o minimize the confusion of multiple systems of measurement, scientists called for a uniform international system of measurement, and over the years, conferences and committees were held to establish a set of standard units, the base units of which are found in Table 17.5 . Although the de nitions in Table 17.5 are precise, they are dis- satisfying. Why, for example, should a meter be de ned as the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second? It sounds like a rather random de nition and is certainly dif cult to concep- tualize. Originally the de nitions of the basic units were easier to conceptualize, but as time progressed, the de nitions became more spe- ci c so as to avoid errors or circular reasoning. Nonetheless, it is interesting to see what the orig-inal de nitions were. a . De nition of length: Scientists wanted to ensure that the standard length of a meter was the same around the world and came up with a de nition based on the motion of a pendu- lum. The period of a pendulum is the time it takes for a bob to complete one swing and return to its original location. The period of a pendulum is dependent only on its length, and so, scientists argued, a length of 1 m could be de ned in terms of the period of a pendu- lum. What is that de nition? Construct a 1 m pendulum by tying a weight to a 1 m length of string, and recording the time for 10 complete swings. Divide the time by 10 to determine the period of one pendulum swing. Repeat this process twice, take an average value, and complete the following de nition. A meter is the length of a pendulum having a period of seconds. b . De nition of mass: Originally scientists sought to de ne the standard measure of mass (the kilogram) as the mass of a known volume of water. Place a 1 or 2 L graduated cylinder on a balance, and determine its mass. Slowly add water until the mass has increased by pre-cisely 1 kg. What volume of water has a mass of 1 kg? Remembering that 1 ml is identical to 1 cubic centimeter and that 1 cubic cm is equal one - thousandth of a cubic decimeter or one - millionth of a cubic meter, complete the following de nition: A kilogram is the mass of cubic o f w a t e r . c17.indd 333 Units for the Same Quantities The left column in Table 17.7 lists some of the most commonly measured quantities, and the middle column lists their SI units. The list after the table provides a list of other units that are used in the measurement of one of these eight quantities. Examine each of these terms, and try to determine which quantity it measures (e.g., distance, mass time). Place these units in the table adjacent to the quantity you believe they measure. 17.4 CGS and MKS Units The metric system was introduced to simplify calcu- lations and facilitate communication between scien-tists and engineers. Ironically, however, two separate approaches to metric measurements developed. Scientists working in laboratories preferred to work Table 17.7 Different Units for the Same Quantities Quantity SI Base Units Other Units distance meters (m) mass kilograms (kg)time seconds (s)temperature kelvin (K)volume cubic centimeters (cm 3) density pressure per square meter (N/m2) 6:06:42 PMDimensional Analysis 335 with smaller measures of mass and length than those working in the eld. For example, research chemists, working with small quantities of chemi-cals in the laboratory, preferred to measure masses in grams, while chemical engineers, analyzing pro-duction processes, preferred to measure produc-tion in kilograms. As a result, two metric systems of measurement arose: the CGS system (based on the c entimeter, g ram, and s econd), and the MKS sys- tem (based upon the m eter, k ilogram, and s econd). Table 17.8 compares the CGS with the MKS units. In 1960, the Eleventh General Conference on Weights and Measures addressed this issue and set forth the International System of Units (SI), using the meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, and candela as basic units. Since 1960, there has been a trend among scientists and engineers to report measurements in MKS units, but many continue to report them in CGS, and some still prefer to report measurements in customary English units. When comparing data reported in different sys-tems, scientists generally convert all units to MKS values. T o ensure that this conversion process is done accurately, scientists use dimensional analy-sis to convert all measures to MKS. ACTIVITY 17.4.1 Converting CGS Units to MKS Units Use Table 17.8 and dimensional analysis to convert the following CGS units to MKS units: (1) 20 cm, (2) 150 g, (3) 25 ba, (4) 2 cal, (5) 100,000 dyn, (6) 10 12 Fr, (7) 100 G For example, to convert 1. 5 biots to amperes, sim- ply multiply 151015 .B iamp Biamp /H11003 /H11005 17.5 Discovering Physical Laws Using Fundamental Units It is possible to construct all of the words in the English language using just 26 letters. In a simi-lar way, with only seven quantities, it is possible to express all measurable quantities in science: length, mass, time, electric current, temperature, amount, and luminous intensity. These quantities are fundamental because they cannot be expressed in a simpler fashion. Examine Table 17.4 , and note that all of the derived units can be expressed in terms of the seven fundamental units. Time is a fundamental quantity, because it can be expressed in no simpler units than those of time. Distance is a fundamental quantity because it can be expressed in no simpler terms than distance. Velocity, however, is not fundamen- tal, because it can be expressed as a ratio of two Table 17.8 SI CGS and MKS Units CGS Unit Measuring SI MKS Equivalent centimeter (cm) distance .01 meter (m) gram (g) mass .001 kilogram ( kg)second (s) time 1 second (s)barye (ba) pressure 0.1 pascal (Pa)biot (Bi) electric current 10 amperes (A)calorie (cal) heat joule ( J )dyne (dyn) force 10 /H110025 newton erg (erg) work, energy 10/H110027 joule (J) franklin (Fr) electric charge 3.36 /H11003 10/H1100210 coulomb (C) galileo (Gal) acceleration 0.01 meter per second squared (m\u00b7s/H110022) gauss (G) magnetic fl ux (ph) illumination 104 dynamic and time ( v /H11005 d/t ). Because velocity can be derived from distance and time, it is known as a derived unit. Just as all words can be expressed as a series of letters, so all measurable quantities can be expressed in terms of their fundamental quantities. Dimensional analysis of terms that are expressed in fundamental units can reveal many impor-tant relationships. For example, the farad (F) is a measure of electrical capacitance ( C, the ability to store charge) and can be expressed in fundamental terms as: FAs kg m/H1100524 2 where A represents amps (a measure of current or charge), s represents seconds (a measure of time ), kg represents kilograms (a measure of mass ), and m represents meters (a measure of length ). An examination of Table 17.4 shows that the units of a farad, FAs kg m/H1100524 2 are similar to the units of an inverse volt, 13 2V/H11005As kg m If we multiply an inverse volt by current (amps, A) and time (seconds, s), the units are far-ads (F), a measure of capacitance: As As kg mAs kg mF 3 224 2()/H11005/H11005 In other words, a farad is equal to an amp \u00b7 second divided by a volt: FAs V/H11005 In Table 17.4 we notice that a coulomb (C, a measure of charge) is de ned as an amp \u00b7 second, and we can therefore rewrite the equation to show the relationship of the units: FC V/H11005 Since a farad is a unit of capacitance ( C ), a coulomb a measure of charge ( Q ), and a volt a measure of potential difference ( V ), the equation may be expressed in quantities as: CQ V/H11005 Thus, by examining the fundamental units of capacitance, current, and potential difference, we have determined that capacitance is the ratio of charge to potential difference ( C /H11005 Q/V ), which is what we nd in the dictionary: \" capacitance is equal to the surface charge divided by the electric potential. \" Important note: It is important to distinguish quantities (e.g., capacitance, C; charge, Q; potential difference, V ) from the SI units used to measure these quantities (e.g., farads, F; coulombs, C; and volts, V). By convention, quantities are expressed in italics, while speci c units are not. The use of similar letters for both quantities and units may lead to much confusion, particularly in a prob-lem like this. Note, for example, that C (capaci- tance, measured in farads, F) is not the same as C ( coulombs, a unit of charge, Q ) . ACTIVITY 17.5.1 Discovering Key Equations with Dimensional Analysis Table 17.4 showsthe most commonly used units and illustrates how they may be expressed in fun-damental terms. The seven fundamental quanti-ties are shown at the top of the table in bold print. Table 17.9 lists sets of physical quantities that are related. By examining the fundamental units of these quantities, determine their relationship and express it mathematically. Each quantity (second column) should be expressed in terms of the quantities listed in the nal column, as illustrated in the example in the rst line. It is not necessary to understand what each term means to discover relationships. c17.indd 336 c17.indd 336 5/9/08 6:06:43 PM 5/9/08 6:06:43 PMDimensional Analysis 337 17.6 Simplifying Calculations with the Line Method Which of the answers in Figure 17.4 is correct for the problem in the box? The problem is ambigu-ous, so any of them could be correct, depending on the assumptions made and the sequence of math-ematical operations performed. If you assume that the problem is 3/2 divided by 5/7, then you could indicate this by extending the line between 2 and 5 and arrive at 2.10 (Figure 17.4 A). If, how-ever, you assume that the problem is 3/2 divided by 5 divided by 7, then you could indicate this by drawing the lines as illustrated in Figure 17.4 B and arrive at 0.043. Finally, if you assume the problem is 5/7 divided into 2, divided into 3, you could draw the lines as illustrated in Figure 17.4 C and arrive at 1.07! The traditional setup allows one to place fractions over fractions but requires that the solver specify the sequence of operations by the lengths of the dividing lines or by parentheses. Unfortunately, many teachers and students are not precise in their problem setup, leading to confusion and errors in calculation. Slight differences in line length may not be detected, resulting in different calculations. T o avoid this and other problems, it is preferable to use the line method. The line method requires that the problem solver place all fractions Table 17.9 Discovering Key Equations with Dimensional Analysis Derived Unit QuantityExpressed as Fundamental UnitsComplete the Equation . . of . . . volt diff., V) kg As2 3 m V /H11005 IR current (I) resistance (R) watt (power, P) kg s2 3m P /H11005 current (I) potential difference (V) watt (power, P) kg s2 3m P /H11005 current (I) resistance (R) watt (power, P) kg s2 3m P /H11005 work (W) time (t) joule (energy, E) kg s2 2m E /H11005 force (F) distance (d) joule (energy, E) kg s2 2m E /H11005 work (W) joule (energy, E) kg s2 2m E /H11005 mass (m) velocity (v) joule (energy, E) kg s2 2m E /H11005 mass (m) acceleration (a) distance (d) N\u00b7s (impulse) kg sm Impulse /H11005 force (F) time (t) farad (capacitance, C) As kg m2 2 4C /H11005 potential difference (V) charge (Q) Pa (pressure, p) kg s2m p /H11005 force ( F ) 6:06:44 PM338 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science on one straight line so that there are no fractions over fractions. Since multiplication by the inverse of a fraction is the same thing as division by the fraction, all calculations can be reduced to a single line. For example, if the problem is 3/2 divided by 5/7, it can be illustrated on a straight line, as shown in Figure 17.4 D. Figures 17.4 E and 17.4 F illustrate the straight line representation for the other two solutions. Note that there are no fractions over fractions, and hence no confusion regarding the operation to be performed. In the line method, each vertical line rep- resents multiplication, and the horizontal line indicates division. No fractions are placed over fractions. If a fraction exists in the numerator, its numerator is placed on top of the line and its denominator under the line beneath it. If, how-ever, a fraction exists in the denominator, it is inverted so that the numerator is placed under the main line and its denominator immediately above it. Compare the traditional method (Example 1) with the line method (Example 2) for the solution of the following problems: Example 1: What is the approximate tempera- ture of 3 mol of nitrogen gas contained in a 5 L fl ask at 20 atm (R /H11005 0. 0821 L atm/mol K)? The traditional method requires that the uni-versal gas constant, R, be placed as a fraction in the denominator (Figure 17.5 A). By contrast, the line method requires that the universal gas constant, R, be inverted and multiplied so that there are no fractions in the numerator or denominator (Figure 17.5 B). It is now easier to see how units cancel (Figure 17.5 C). Example 2: An ancient measurement of volume mentioned in the Bible is the ephah. Write an equation using the line format to express 1.00 ephah in liters using the follow-ing conversion factors (Figure 17.6 ): 1 ephah /H11005 2.429 modium (a modium is an volume) 1 modium /H11005 0.7076 vedro (a vedro is an old Russian measure of volume) 3 2 5 7=?3 2=1.50 5 75= Ctraditional setup straight-line setup5L Figure 17.5 Traditional (A) and Line (B, C) Methods 1 cubic inch0.01639 liters 1 ephah2.429 modium 1 modium0.7076 1 bushel2150 cubic inches 1.00 ephah=21.1 liters Figure 17.6 Line Setup for Unit Conversion Problem c17.indd 338 c17.indd 338 5/9/08 vedro /H11005 0.349 bushels (a customary measure of volume) 1 bushel /H11005 2150 cubic inches 1 cubic inch /H11005 0.01639 liters The line method generally reduces the number of pen strokes and makes the problem setup less cluttered. Students should know how to solve a problem using both the traditional and line tech-niques, but I recommend the line method for most problems involving dimensional analysis. ACTIVITY 17.6.1 Dimensional Analysis with the Line Method Set up each of the following problems on a straight line. Note that it is not necessary to understand the context of the problems to set them up correctly. What are the nal values and units in each case? 1. A tsubo is a Japanese unit of area. Write an equation using the line method to express 1 tsubo in m 2 given that 1 tsubo is equal to 5124 in 2 , 1 in 2 is equal to 6.452 cm 2 , and 1 cm 2 is equal to 0.0001 m 2 . 2. Write an equation using the line method to express 1 light - year (the distance light travels in 365. 25 days) in meters, knowing that light travels at 3.0 /H11003 10 8 m/s. 3. Write an equation using the line method to express 1.0 g in carats.

It is a single binary number represented by a 1 or a 0. The bit can be a transistor or capacitor in a memory cell, a magnetic domain on a hard disk drive, or a refl ective dot on an optical disc. Write an equation in line format to express 1 terabyte of memory in bits given that there are 1024 gigabytes per terabyte, 1024 megabytes 1024 bytes per kilobyte, and 8 bits per byte.

White opens the game by selecting any of 20 possible opening moves. Black counters with 20 possible moves, bringing the number of variants to 400 at the end of two moves (one com-plete turn). The number grows rapidly as the game progresses: three moves, 8902; four moves (two complete turns), 197,281; ve moves, 4,865,609; six moves (three complete turns), 119,060,324. Thus, at the end of just six moves, there are nearly 120 million possible variants of the game! Expert Figure 17.7 Chess Players The Sourcebook for Teaching Science chess players often plan three or four moves ahead, but certainly they cannot ponder all of the options. Instead of considering all scenarios, they focus on logical ones, dramatically increasing their ef ciency and effectiveness. Chess masters develop heuristics, methods for directing their attention to reasonable options while ignoring unreasonable ones. Rather than considering all options, they concentrate only on those that are more likely to produce favorable results. Chess players will not advance in the game until they develop good heuristics that allow them to discard unlikely variants and focus only on the likely ones. In a similar manner, scientists use problem - solving strategies that allow them to focus their attention on likely possibilities rather than all possibilities. Perhaps the most widely used problem - solving strategy is dimensional analysis (also know as unit analysis and factor - label method ). Dimensional analysis allows you to set up the problem and check for logic errors before performing calculations and to determine intermediate answers en route to the solution. A student or scientist who does not use dimensional analysis is like a chess player who has not learned key strategies of the game. He or she will spend an inordinate amount of time checking illogical pos-sibilities, with no assurance that the steps taken are correct. Dimensional analysis has ve basic steps: 1 . Unknown: Clearly specify the units (dimen- sions) of the desired product (the unknown). These will become the target units for your equation. 2 . Knowns: Specify all known values with their associated units. It is often a good idea to draw a diagram of what you know about the situ- ation, placing values with their units on the diagram. 3 . Conversion factors and formulas: Specify rele- vant formulas and all conversion factors (with their units). 4 . Equation: Develop an equation (using appro- priate formulas and conversion factors) such that the units of the left side (the side containing the known values) are equivalent to the units of the right side (the side con-taining the unknown). If the units are not equal, the problem has not been set up cor-rectly and further changes in the setup must be made. 5 . Calculation: Perform the calculation only after you have analyzed all dimensions and are certain that both sides of your equation have equivalent units. Example 1: Medicine The label on a stock drug container gives the concentration of a solution as 1200 mg/mL. Determine the volume of the medication that must be given to ll a physician ' s order of 1600 mg of the drug (Figure 17.8 ). 1 . Unknown: An analysis of the problem shows that the unknown (the volume of solution to be given) must have units of volume (mL medicine). 2 . Knowns: We know that the solution has a con- centration of 1200 mg drug/mL medicine and that we must obtain 1600 mg of the drug. Figure 17.8 illustrates what must be done. 3 . Conversion factors and formulas: None nece ssary.

Equation: Y ou must divide by concentration and multiply by mass of the drug in order to get the desired units (mg medicine). 5 . Calculation: After the units are canceled, the equation yields 1.333 mL of medicine. Example 2: Space Science On June 19, 1976, the United States successfully landed Viking 1 on the surface of the planet Mars. Twenty years later, on July 4, 1997, NASA landed another robotic probe, Mars Path nder, at a dis- tance of 520 miles from the Viking 1 landing site. Unlike the Viking mission, the Path nder mis- sion included a surface rover known as Sojourner, a six - wheeled vehicle that was controlled by an Earth - based operator. Knowing that the distance between the landing site of the Mars Path nder and the Viking 1 craft is 520 mi, what would be the minimum number of hours required to drive Sojourner to the Viking site assuming a top speed of 0.70 cm/s, and no obstacles (Figure 17.9 ). 1 . Unknown: The number of hours to reach the Viking 1 site. 2 . Knowns : The distance is 520 mi, and the speed is 0.7 cm/s. 3 . Conversion factors and formulas: The distance is measured in customary units (miles), and the speed of Sojourner is measured in metric units (cm/s). We will therefore need to use the following conversion ratios to obtain units with the correct dimensions: 2.54 cm/in., 12 in./ft, 5280 ft/mi. 4 . Equation: The answer must have units of time. The only known factor that includes units of time is the speed of the rover (distance/time). It is therefore evident that we must divide by speed to get units of time in the numerator where they are needed. T o arrive at the desired units of time, it is necessary to cancel the units of distance by multiplying by the distance that must be traveled. It is now necessary to multiply or divide by the appropriate conversion ratios to ensure that all units of distance are canceled. 5 . Calculation: After the units are canceled, the equation yields the answer in hours, as desired. The number is changed to two signi cant g- ures since one of the factors has only two sig-ni cant gures, and you can have no greater accuracy than your least accurate factor. Example 3: Physics A 2.00 L tank of helium gas contains 1.785 g at a pressure of 202 kPa. What is the temperature of the gas in the tank in kelvin given that the molecular weight of helium is 4.002 g/mol and the universal gas constant is 8.29 /H11003 10 3 L \u00b7 Pa/ mol \u00b7 K (Figure 17.10 )? 1 . Unknown: The unknown is the temperature of the gas, expressed in kelvin. 2 . Knowns: Volume of helium container (2.00 kPa), universal gas constant (8.29 /H11003 10 3 L \u00b7 Pa/mol \u00b7 K). In addition, we know the number of moles ( 3 . Conversion factors and formulas: This problem requires the use of the Ideal Gas Law equa-tion ( PV /H11005 nRT ), which of temperature: T /H11005 PV/nR.

Equation: The equation must be set up so all units cancel except the desired units, kelvin (K). 5 . Calculation: Once the equation is set up so that the units cancel to leave only the target units of K, calculations can be performed. Example 4: Chemistry Calculate the mass of silver metal that can be depos- ited if a 5.12 ampere current is passed through a sil-ver nitrate solution for 2.00 hours. Note: There are 96,500 C per mole of electrons, and the gram atomic weight of silver is 107.9 g/mol (Figure 17.11 ). 1 . Unknown: An analysis of the problem shows that the unknown (the mass of silver metal deposited) must have units of grams silver. 2 . Knowns: We know that the current is 5.12 amps for a period of 2.00 hours. We also know that 1 mole of silver is deposited per mole of electrons from the fact that silver is a plus one cation (Ag /H11001 /H11001 e /H11002 Ag). From the problem description, we know the experimental setup and can therefore draw a diagram. We also can acquire the gram - atomic weight of silver from the periodic table. 3 . Conversion factors and formulas: This prob- lem requires a number of conversion fac-tors in order to get the appropriate units. One coulomb is 1 amp second. One mole of electrons is 96,500 coulombs. One hour is 60 minutes. One minute is 60 seconds. Because these are equalities, they can be rep-resented as conversion factors, each of which is equal to one. 4 . Equation: The units of the unknown become the target units and are set up on the right side of the equation. The left side of the equation is assembled so that units will cancel and leave only the target units. 5 . Calculation: Once the equation is set up so that the units cancel to leave only the target units, calculations can be performed. Example 5: Earth Science The island of Greenland is approximately 840,000 mi 2 , 85 percent of which is covered by ice with an average thickness of 1500 m. Estimate the mass of the ice in Greenland in kg (assume two signi cant gures). The density of ice is 0.917 g/mL, and 1 cm 3 /H11005 1 mL (Figure 17.12 ).

Unknown: An analysis of the problem shows that the unknown must have units of mass. Since the speci c units of mass are not speci- ed, we will use the MKS unit of kilograms. 2 . Knowns: Since we know that the area of Greenland is 840,000 miles 2 and 85 percent of it is covered by ice, then 714,000 miles 2 must be covered by ice. We also know that the density of ice /H11005 0.917 g/mL and the ice has an average depth (height) of 1500 m. 3 . Conversion factors and formulas: Some meas- urements are in customary units, while oth-ers are in metric. We should always convert all units to metric unless otherwise speci ed. T o do so, we will need to convert miles to meters using the following conversion factors: 5280 ft/mile, and 0.3048 m/ft. We also need to use conversion factors to obtain consistent metric units for mass and volume. Knowing that 1 cm /H11005 0.01 m, then 1 cm 3 /H11005 0.000001 m 3 . We also know that 1 kg /H11005 1000 g. 4 . Equation: The units of the unknown become the target units and are set up on the right side of the equation (kg ice). The equation mass /H11005 (height /H11003 area) density is the basic equation, and the conversion factors are inserted to make certain all units are consistent. 5 . Calculation: Once the equation is set up so units cancel to leave only the target units of kilograms of ice, calculations can be p e r f o r m e d . Example 6: Biology The rate of photosynthesis is often measured in the number of micromoles of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) xed per square meter of leaf tissue, per second ( /H9262 mol CO 2 /m 2 s).

Unknown: We are trying to determine the rate of photosynthesis in units of /H9262 mol CO 2 /m 2 s. 2 . Knowns: The rate of carbon dioxide assimila- tion by the leaf is 0.00005 g of carbon dioxide per minute. We also know that the leaf area responsible for this is 10 cm 2 . 3 .

We also know that there are 10 6 micromoles/mole, 100 cm/m, and 60 s/min. We may multiply or divide by these unit factors because each one is an iden-tity (equal to 1). 4 . Equation: Since the rate of photosynthesis is de ned as the number of moles of carbon dioxide absorbed per square meter of tissue per second, the equation becomes: Rate /H11005 quantity of CO 2 per square area of tissue, per second. 5.

Unfortunately, many see stoichiometry (the quanti- tative relationships among the reactants and prod-ucts in a reaction) as an irrelevant exercise in logic, and it is therefore important to give suf cient examples from each of the sciences to demonstrate how stoichiometry describes the interactions of matter and energy. The following are a few of the many important chemical and nuclear reactions foundational to physics, biology, and the earth and space sciences. Review these equations with your students so they may come to realize the impor-tance of stoichiometry to all of the sciences, not just chemistry. Physics Fusion: Nuclear fusion is the process that fuels our Sun and other stars, producing the light necessary for life on Earth. One of the many fusion reactions that takes place in the sun is the fusion of hydrogen - 1 and hydrogen - 2 to form helium - 3 and gamma radiation: 11 12 23HH H e/H11001/H11001 /H9253 Fission: Nuclear ssion is a reaction in which a heavy nucleus splits into lighter nuclei with the release of a large quantity of energy that can be used to power or destroy civilizations. The rst human - initiated nuclear ssion reaction resulted from the bombardment of uranium - 235 by neutrons: 92235 01 56141 3692 013 Un B a K r n e n e r g y/H11001/H11001 /H11001 Sourcebook for Teaching Science One example of chemical weathering is the rusting of formation: The following equation is for a nuclear fusion reaction thought to take place in stars, where internal temperatures exceed 15 million degrees Kelvin. The element nitrogen is formed by the fusion of carbon and hydro-gen, and without such processes, there would be no heavy elements. 612 11 713CH N/H11001/H11001 /H9253 Atmospheric pollution: The greenhouse effect is caused primarily by extensive burning of fossil fuels (natural gas, gasoline, coal, and oil), lead-ing to an increase in the concentration of atmos-pheric carbon dioxide. In addition to retaining heat in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide acidi- es rain. The following equation shows how carbon dioxide reacts with water to give car-bonic acid, one of the components that lowers the pH of rainwater and contributes to another serious ecological problem known as acid rain. C O HO HC O22 2 3/H11001 Mastering the Mechanics of Equation Balancing People get lost in forests when they \" can ' t see the forest because of the trees. \" T o nd their way, hik- ers may climb a mountain to gain perspective. Much of the confusion students experience in sci-ence is due to a lack of perspective. When trying to understand stoichiometry, it is particularly impor-tant for students to have perspective before focus-ing on mechanics. Stoichiometry is concerned with the quantita- tive relationships among the reactants and products in a chemical or nuclear reaction. It involves more than equation balancing. It is important to know the numerical relationships between reactants and products and why a reactant or product has the Electrolysis: In an effort to provide energy for society ' s needs and reduce dependence on petroleum, physicists and engineers are work-ing to perfect fuel cell technology. Fuel cells are dependent on hydrogen, which can be pro-duced in a process known as electrolysis. 2222 2HOl H g O g ( ) () ()+ Biology Photosynthesis: Plants use light energy to synthe- size high - energy sugars (glucose) from car-bon dioxide and water. Photosynthesis yields the sugars that are necessary for the survival of plants and animals, as well as the oxygen essential for respiration: 66 622 6 1 2 62CO H O C H O O + light/H11001 Respiration: Respiration is the process by which plants and animals transfer energy from the chemical bonds of sugar to the phosphate bonds of ATP , a form of energy necessary to the survival of all cells.

For example, why is water H 2 O rather than H 3 O? One could say, \" This relationship exists because oxygen has a /H110011 oxidation state and hydrogen a /H11002 2 oxidation state, so the two electrons contributed by the two hydrogens ful ll the two oxidation state de cit of oxygen. \" Although this is accurate, it does not explain why the elements have the oxidation states they do. In this chapter we rst focus on (1) the logic behind oxidation states, then (2) show how this determines the chemical for-mulas of reactants and products, before (3) intro-ducing techniques for equation balancing that are based on these principles. T o understand the process of equation balanc- ing, students must rst understand the principle of the conservation of mass. The rst law of thermody- namics (the law of conservation of mass and energy) states that during natural processes, matter and energy are neither created nor destroyed. The proc-esses that change the chemical or physical properties of a substance in an isolated system do so without changing the mass. The law of the conservation of mass is one of a number of conservation laws that state that a particular property does not change over time in an isolated system. In addition to the conser- vation of mass, the conservation of energy, momentum, angular momentum, electric charge, and magnetic fl ux are principles that can be introduced to help students understand the interactions of matter. An understanding of the conservation of mass and electrical charge is foundational to the process of equation balancing. The reactants are placed on one side of the equation and the products on the other, and the mass and charge on the left must equal the mass and charge on the right. In a chemi-cal reaction, matter can be rearranged but never destroyed or created. Therefore, we can represent chemical reactions as equations. An equation is a mathematical statement of the equality of two things. In the case of chemical reactions, the equa-tion shows that the total mass and charge of the reactants must equal the total mass and charge of the products. Thus, a chemical equation is similar to an algebraic equation. For example, the chemical equation for the hydrolysis of water can be represented in traditional algebraic fashion, where x represents hydrogen and y represents oxygen:2222 2HO H O /H11001 22 22 2() ( )xy x y/H11001/H11005 /H11001 In both instances, one side of the equation has an equivalent number of each component as the right side, hence the term equation. The rst law of thermodynamics is known as the law of conser-vation of energy and mass. Although matter can be converted to energy in nuclear reactions (the special theory of relativity illustrates that mass and energy are related: E = mc 2 , where E = energy, m = mass, and c = speed of light), it always remains as matter in chemical reactions. Thus, not only must there be a balance of mass on both sides of a chemi-cal equation, there must also be a balance in the quantity of each species. For example, if there are four hydrogen atoms on the left, there must be four hydrogen atoms on the right. Similarly, if there is no net charge on the left side of the equation, there will be no net charge on the right side either. Balancing Redox Reactions in Acidic or Basic Solutions In this chapter, students are introduced to a simple and effective technique for balancing equations. Although it can be used for the majority of prob-lems, it will not be able to solve all. Redox reac-tions in acidic or basic solutions can be dif cult to balance because there are often several reactants and several products. Table 18.1 lists the steps to follow to help balance equations for such reac-tions, and Table 18.2 contains a sample problem using this technique. Introduce this material only if you have an advanced class and the students have already mastered the simple approach intro-duced in the student section. Consider the oxidation of iodide ion (I /H11002 ) by permanganate ion (MnO 4 /H11002 ) in basic solution to produce molecular iodine (I 2 ) and manganese oxide (MnO 2 ). The skeleton equation is: IM n O M n OI /H11001/H1100142 2 Table 18.2 shows how to apply the steps intro- duced in Table 18.1 to balance the equation. 353 5/9/08 6:14:06 PM 5/9/08 6:14:06 PM354 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Table 18.1 Steps for Balancing Redox Reactions in Acidic or Basic Solutions For Acidic Solutions (1) Write separate equations for the oxidation and reduction half-reactions. (2) For each half-reaction, balance all atoms except hydrogen and oxygen. (3) Balance oxygen using H 2O. (4) Balance hydrogen using H/H11002. (5) Balance the charge using electrons. (6) If necessary, multiply one or both half-reactions by an integer to equalize the number of electrons transferred in the two half-reactions. (7) Add the half-reactions, cancel identical species that occur on both sides, and reduce the coef cients to smallest integers. For Basic Solutions If the solution is basic, use steps 1 through 7 to balance the equation as if the reaction occurred in an acidic solution (containing H /H11002 ions), then add these steps: (8) Note the number of H/H11002 ions in the equation. (9) Add this number of OH/H11002 ions to both sides of equation (to eliminate H/H11002 ions by forming H2O). (10) Cancel any H2O molecules that occur on both sides of the equation and reduce the equation to simplest terms. Table 18.2 Balancing an Equation Using Half-Reactions (Sample) and Ions Introductory chemistry students are often asked to memorize the common ions and their charges. Although it is helpful to have such information memorized, it will be soon forgotten if the logic for these charges is not understood. Why does aluminum generally have a /H110013 charge and barium a /H110012 charge? Why do you never see Al /H110014 or Ba /H110013 in nature? Memorization should not be done in a vacuum but with understanding of underlying principles. c18.indd 354 c18.indd 354 5/9/08 6:14:07 PM 5/9/08 6:14:07 PMStoichiometry: Interactions of Matter 355 If an ion is common, it is probably stable; oth- erwise it would transition to some other form. In general, elements are stable when they have eight valence electrons, such as the noble gases shown in Figure 18.1 . This family was once known as the \" inert gases \" because of their amazing stability (lack of reactivity). Since chemical reactions are dependent on the sharing and exchange of elec-trons, stability indicates that the noble gases have a stable electron con guration. We now know that the stability of this family is due to a complete set of eight valence (outermost) electrons. Chemical reactions are dependent on the sharing and exchange of electrons. The elec-trons that react the most readily are those far-thest from the nucleus. These electrons come in contact with other atoms rst and are there- fore the ones involved in reactions and bonding. Figure 18.2 A shows the Bohr model of the atom, with each small rectangle indicating the possi-ble position of an electron. Note that there are two spaces in level 1, eight in level 2, eighteen in level 3, and so forth. One might think therefore that there are two valence (outermost) electrons in the rst shell, eight in the second, and eighteen in the third. Although this supposition is correct for the rst two levels, it is not correct for the third and subsequent levels. This is because elec-trons ll spaces on an energy basis, with electrons occupying the lowest energy states rst, even if these are not the closest to the nucleus. The energy of an electron is dependent on more than just its distance from the nucleus and is modi ed by the shape of the orbital, the axis of the orbital, and the spin of the electron. Figure 18.2 B shows an energy diagram, indi- cating that electrons ll the spaces at the bottom rst and the top last. Note, however, that the 4s electrons are lower energy than the 3d electrons, even though they are farther (fourth shell) from the nucleus than the 3d electrons (third shell). Thus, the 4s electrons ll before 3d electrons, starting a new shell in which the valence elec-trons will reside. Because 4s electrons ll before number of valence elec trons for these shells is capped at eight (the sum of s and p electrons for any shell). This trend is also true for higher levels, and elements therefore have a maximum of eight valence elec-trons (2 s - electrons plus 6 p - electrons). 1 H Hydrogen 1.007942 He Helium 4.003 3 Li Lithium 6.9414 Be Beryllium B Boron 10.8116 C Carbon 12.01077 N Nitrogen 14.006748 O Oxygen 15.99949 F Fluorine 18.998403210 Ne Neon 20.1797 11 Na Sodium 22.98977012 Mg Magnesium Al Aluminum Sulfur 32.06617 Chlorine 35.452718 gases(He has filled duet) Figure 18.1 Noble Gases Have a Filled Valence Shell c18.indd 355 = 6 n = p d f high energyoutermost (valence) electrons are involved in reactionsd and f electrons are not valence electronsbecause they do not fill until s electrons in the next shell fill. 2 valence electrons in shell18 valence 0 1 1 1 213 14 15 16 1718 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 (A) Bohr Model. (B) Energy Level Diagram. (C) Blocks in Periodic Table The rst electron in a new shell is inherently reactive. It is far from the attractive forces of the nucleus and thus susceptible to the pull of sur-rounding atoms. By contrast, lling the nal valence electron in a shell creates a stable situation in which the valence electrons are as close to the positively charged nucleus as they can get for ele-ments in that shell. When the ratio of protons to 356 c18.indd 356 5/9/08 6:14:08 PM 5/9/08 6:14:08 PMStoichiometry: Interactions of Matter 357 radius is high, the relatively large attractive force (the electrostatic force between the oppositely charged protons in the nucleus and the orbit-ing electrons) is acting over a relatively short dis-tance (radius to electrons) and therefore exerting a relatively large pull. Note that in Figure 18.3 , the eighth family (noble gases) has the smallest radii, and the largest protons to radius ratio, and there-fore the greatest stability. T o add an electron to any of the noble gases requires addition in a new outermost shell. Such an electron would be far away from the attraction of the positively charged nuclei, and thus easily lost. By contrast, the eight electrons in the outer shell of the noble gases represent a completed shell in which the distance to the valence electrons is minimal relative to the attractive charge of the nuclei. Stability is conferred on the noble gases and elements that have the electron con guration of noble gases. For example, chlorine is a member of the seventh family. It has seven valence electrons and can acquire one more to complete its octet. Thus, chloride (Cl /H11002 ) is relatively stable and occurs frequently in nature. Y ou will never see Cl /H11002 /H11002 , because the addition of two electrons requires the placement of an electron in the next higher energy level, an inherently unstable position. Similarly, it is common for barium, a mem-ber of the second family, to lose two electrons to become a Ba /H11001/H11001 ion, which has a completed octet HHeLi Be B C N O F NeNa Mg Al SiP S Cl ArK 0.000.501.001.502.002.50 123456789 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 2 0 Atomic 45678 91 0 1 1 1 213 14 15 16 1718 1 2 3 4 5 6 78th family 8 valence electronsfilled octetsmall radiusstable1st family 1 valence large radius 1 electronAtomic Radius ( \u00c5) vs. Atomic Number f-block Figure 18.3 The Atomic Radius Is a Function of an Element's Position in the Periodic Table c18.indd 357 6:14:10 PM 5/9/08 6:14:10 PM358 Sourcebook Teaching Science with the electron con guration of xenon. The loss of a third electron, however, is extremely dif cult because Ba/H11001/H11001 has the stable con guration associ- ated with a completed octet. Examine Figure 18.4 A. Note that neon has a lled octet of valence electrons. It has a rela- tively small radius, and is stable. By contrast, Ne /H11002 has a very large radius (Figure 18.4 B), with no additional protons to pull on the additional electron. The 3s 1 electron of Ne /H11002 is lost immedi- ately because of the minimal attractive force of the nucleus. Sodium (Na) has the same electron con guration as Ne /H11002 (1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 3s 1 ) but is more stable because it has an additional proton to exert force on it (Figure 18.4 B). However, this elec-tron is still far from the nucleus relative to the pull of the protons, and is therefore easily lost, to form the sodium cation (Na /H11001 ) (Figure 18.4 A). This is a stable ion because it has a small radius with no remote electrons. Thus, it is common to nd Ne and Na /H11001 in nature, but rare to nd Na. Ne /H11002 may exist for a brief moment in some reac- tions but is not seen in nature. Bookkeeping methods using oxidation num- bers (also called oxidation states ) have been devised to help keep track of electrons during chemical reactions. An oxidation number may be de ned as the charge that an atom would have if both of the electrons in each bond were assigned to the more electronegative element (the element with greater attraction for electrons). The oxidation number refl ects the extent to which an element has been oxidized or reduced. Each element in a reac-tion must be assigned an oxidation number. In the case of monatomic ions that have undergone a complete exchange of electrons, the oxidation state is obvious. For example, Na /H11001 and Cl /H11002 ions have oxidation 10 protons (+)10 electrons distant valence electron1s 2s 2p26 23s1Na11 23 Ne-10 20 small radius stability neon anion 10 protons 11 electrons 10 neutronsextremely unstable not seen in natureA B + - Figure 18.4 (A) Ne and Na/H11001 are Stable. (B) Ne/H11002 and Na charges, /H110011 and /H11002 1. In other types of reactions, such as those in which electrons are shared, the assignment of oxidation numbers may not be so clear. Hence, guidelines have been established for assigning oxidation numbers. Note that for oxida-tion numbers, we write the sign before the number (e.g., /H110011) to distinguish oxidation numbers from actual electric charges, for which we write the number before the algebraic sign (e.g., 1 /H11001). For example, in the following equation, the 0 below Fe, the /H110012 below Cu, the /H110012 below Fe, and the 0 below Cu indicate oxidation numbers. The 2 /H11001 after Cu and the 2 /H11001 after Fe indicate the actual charges on these ions. Fe s Cu aq Fe + ACTIVITY 18.1.1 Predicting the Charge on Ions Using the reasoning introduced in this section and a periodic table (Figure 18.1 ), determine if the fol-lowing ions are commonly found in nature: (1 - 6) see Figure 18.5 ; (7) Kr /H11002 ; (8) Ca /H11001/H11001 ; (9) Na /H11001/H11001 ; (10) H /H11001 . ACTIVITY 18.1.2 Predicting Oxidation States Chemists use oxidation states to describe the status of a particular element. The oxidation state shows the total number of electrons that have been removed from an element (positive oxi-dation state) or added to an element (negative oxidation state) to get to its present state. In a mon-atomic ion, it is simply the number of the charge on the element. In molecules, however, the oxidation number represents the number of electrons lost (or partially lost) or gained (or partially gained) to form bonds. An element assumes an oxidation state if the addition or removal of electrons will com-plete an octet ( lled s and p orbitals in a shell) or an s - orbital (Figure 18.1 ). Many students memorize oxidation states, but such a process is time - consum-ing and may not involve much thinking. In this activity, you will see that the com- mon oxidation states for elements are a function 123- +++ + + ++++ for Teaching Science of their position in the periodic table. Filled s or lled p orbitals add considerable stability to an ele- ment. Each of the elements in Table 18.3 has com-mon oxidation states, some of which are shown. These oxidation states are predictable based on the position of the element in the periodic table. For example, a common oxidation state of iodine is /H11002 1 because it gains one electron (gaining a negative charge reduces the oxidation state) as it completes the p orbital and lls the octet of valence electrons. Look at the position of each element listed in Table 18.3 in the periodic table (Figure 18.1 ) and indi-cate if the oxidation state listed is a result of a lled octet or lled s - orbital. For example, place a mark in the \" lled octet \" space adjacent to aluminum, indicating that its /H110013 oxidation state results from the loss of three electrons, taking it to the electron con guration of neon, and a lled octet (1s 2 2s 2p 6 ) . 18.2 Predicting Polyatomic Ions, Reactants, and Products One of the reasons that English is a dif cult lan- guage to learn is that it has the world ' s largest vocabulary, a large percentage of which is not spelled phonetically (including the term phonet- ics ). In an effort to deal with the inconsistencies characteristic to natural languages like English, the Polish linguist L. L. Zamenhof developed an arti- cial language in which all verbs are regular, all grammar regular, and all spelling phonetic. The language, known as Esperanto, is extremely easy to learn because it is predictable and consistent. Fortunately, chemistry, like Esperanto, is highly predictable for those who understand the underlying principles. In section 18.1 we learned how to predict the oxidation states of elements in the periodic table, and although there are some states that we cannot predict based on the rules introduced, the majority of the common ones are predictable. The formulas of many polyatomic ions and compounds can be predicted on the basis of oxidation numbers, which are themselves pre-dictable based on the position an element occupies in the periodic table. Knowing this and the follow-ing rules, one can predict if a compound is logical: The oxidation state of an uncombined ele- ment is zero. The sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms or ions in a neutral compound is zero. The sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms in an ion is equal to the charge on the ion. The more electronegative element in a sub-stance is given a negative oxidation state. The less electronegative one is given a positive oxi-dation state. Fluorine is the most electronega-tive element, with oxygen second most. Table 18.3 Predicting Oxidation States on the Basis of Filled Orbitals ElementOxidation State Filled OctetFilled S-Orbital Interactions of Matter 361 Some elements almost always have the same oxidation states in their compounds: Group 1 metals (halogens) are /H110011; Group 2 metals (alkali metals) are /H110012; oxygen /H11002 2, and hydro- gen /H110011 . For example, sodium chloride is logical because sodium is a group 1 metal and assumes an oxidation state of 11, while chlorine is a halo-gen and assumes an oxidation state of /H11002 1. The sum of the oxidation states is zero, indicating that one sodium (11) is matched with one chlo-rine ( /H11002 1) to produce neutral sodium chloride (NaCl) (Figure 18.6 ). Similarly, calcium bromide must have the formula CaBr 2 because calcium is a group 2 metal, assumes an oxidation state of 12 in compounds and can pair with two bromine atoms, both of which have a /H11002 1 state. Thus, one of the electrons donated by calcium binds with one bromine, while the other binds with a sec-ond bromine atom. The resulting formula, CaBr 2 indicates that the product has zero net charge. By contrast, you would never see CaBr 3 in nature because the oxidation number of calcium (12) adds to three negatively charged bromines ( /H11002 1) to give a net charge of /H11002 1, not zero as indicated by the formula CaBr 3 . ACTIVITY 18.2.1 Using Oxidation Numbers to Predict Polyatomic Ions Table 18.4 shows common oxidation states of select elements. Use the data in this table to determine if the ions listed in Table 18.5 are logical or illogical. A substance is \" illogical \" if the oxidation numbers do not add up correctly. For each of the pairs in Table 18.5 , add up the oxidation numbers to see if they match the ion charge. If an element has more than one oxidation number, select those that will most closely balance to give the indicated charge. Write the sum of the oxidation numbers in the column to the right of each ion, and highlight 123 123 Na Cl+ Figure 18.6 The Electron Lost by Na Is Gained by ClTable 18.4 Common Oxidation States of Select Elements Element O /H110022, phosphorous P platinum Pt potassium K Si /H110012,/H110014 silver Ag /H110011 sodium Na Sr for Teaching Science or circle the member of each pair that is a real compound based on your analysis, and strike through the one that is not as shown in the rst example. ACTIVITY 18.2.2 Determining Element Ra tios in Ionic Compounds Ionic compounds form as a result of the attrac-tion between cations (positively charged ions) and anions (negatively charged ions). In ionic compounds, the total positive charge must equal the total negative charge. For example, the singly charged ammonium (NH 4 1 ) cation will combine in a one - to - one ratio with the singly charged bro-mide (Br /H11002 ) anion to form ammonium bromide: NH Br. By contrast, three bromide ions (Br /H11002 ) are required to balance the chromium (III) cation Cr 31 when forming chromic bromide (CrBr 3 ). Table 18.6 lists common cations and anions. This activity is designed to help visualize the ratios in which ionic compounds form. Make four photocopies of Figure 18.7 A, and cut all of the individual ion symbols apart. If possible, photo-copy these onto overhead transparencies so that you can show others your work on the overhead projector. Cations (light circles) combine with ani-ons (dark hexagons) in such a way that there is no net charge. For example, combine one aluminum (charge /H110013) with three nitrites (charge /H11002 1) to Table 18.5 Which of Ba++O--A BC D Figure 18.7 Determining and Visualizing Ratios in Ionic Compounds produce neutral aluminum nitrite (Al(NO 2 ) 3 ) as shown in Figure 18.7 B. Ratios other than 1:3 will not produce a neutral product, and therefore will not occur in nature. Now combine two sodiums (/H110011) with one sulfate ( /H11002 2) (Figure 18.7 one barium ( /H110012) with one oxygen ( /H11002 2) as shown in gure (Figure 18.7 D). Notice how the net charge in each case is zero. Y ou will notice in Table 18.4 that certain metallic elements form more than one ion. For example, iron may carry a /H110012 charge or a /H110013 charge. T o differentiate these, we apply a Roman numeral after the metal ion for clari cation. For example, Fe 2/H11001 is known as the iron (II) ion, and the Fe 3/H11001 ion is known as the iron (III) ion. In the following list, combine ion symbols to balance charge (net charge of zero), and determine appro-priate formulas for the compounds listed: a. ammonium nitrate (a common component of lawn fertilizers) b. calcium carbonate (found in Carlsbad Caverns, Mammoth Caves, and other lime-stone caves) c. hydrogen sulfate (also known as sulfuric acid, one of the most common industrial acids) d. iron (III) oxide (ferric oxide; a form of rust, used as a red pigment in paints) e. magnesium hydroxide (used in antacids and laxatives such as milk 362 5/9/08 6:14:15 PM of Matter 363 f. silver chloride (a photochemical used in the development of lm) g. sodium hydrogen carbonate (sodium bicar- bonate; baking soda, used to deodorize refrig-erators and as a leavening agent to help bread rise) h. calcium phosphate (one of the main compo- nents in bone; used in plant fertilizers to pro-vide phosphorous) i. sodium nitrite (kills bacteria; used to preserve such foods as frankfurters, corned beef, and tuna sh) j. ammonium phosphate (used by re ghters to retard the spread of forest res) 18.3 Techniques for Balancing Equations Does your car use regular - , extra - , or premium - grade gasoline (Figure 18.8 )? The grade of a gasoline is based on its \" octane rating. \" Octane ratings measure a gasoline ' s ability to resist engine knock, a pinging sound that results from prema-ture ignition of the compressed fuel - air mixture in the cylinders. Most stations offer regular (87), extra (89), and premium (93) gasolines, and the pumps are marked with bright yellow stickers as shown in Figure 18.8 . At the re nery, many hydrocarbon chains are made from the cracking of crude oil. Hydrocarbons that are 7 - carbons (heptane) or 8 - carbons (octane) in length are particularly good for use in automo-bile engines. Octane resists knocking better than heptane, and a gasoline that is rated at 93 octane (premium grade) is made of 93 percent octane and 7 percent heptane, or some other combination of fuels that has the same performance. The combus-tion of octane in the cylinders of your car can be represented by the following equation: 22 5 1 6 1 881 8 2 2 2CH g O g C O g HOg () () () ()/H11001/H11001 The equation indicates that 25 oxygen mol- ecules are required to combust 2 octane molecules and will produce 16 carbon dioxide molecules and 18 water molecules. The chemical equation is an algebraic expression describing the chemical reac- tion. In a chemical equation, the material to the left of the arrow indicates the reactants and the material on the right the products. The law of con-servation of mass states that in a chemical reaction, no mass is lost or gained, so the total mass on the left side of the equation should equal the total on the right, and the total number of atoms of each element on the left must match the total number of atoms of the same elements on the right. Note that there are 16 carbons on the left and 16 on the right, 50 oxygens on the left and 50 on the right, and 36 hydrogens on the left and 36 hydrogens on the right. How are equations balanced? The following is a powerful and proven tech- nique that you can use to balance equations. Focus on the logic of each step, not just the results: I. Word Equation: Identify the reactants and products. Determine the reactants and products from experimental observations. Express the reaction in words. II. Skeleton Equation: Determine the formulas for the reactants and products. Express reactants and products as formu-las. Make certain the subscripts within pol-yatomic ions or subgroups are correct (see section 18.2; Table 18.6 ). Adjust only subscripts of entire ions or subgroups (not the elements within a poly-atomic ion or subgroup) to balance oxida-tion states within reactants and products (see section 18.2). III. Balanced Equation: Determine the stoichio- metric relationship of the reaction Change only the coef cients of the reac- tants or products to balance the equa-tion. The number of each element should be the same on both sides of the equation. 87MINIMUM OCTANE RATING (R+M)/2 METHOD 89MINIMUM OCTANE RATING (R+M)/2 METHOD 93MINIMUM OCTANE RATING (R+M)/2 METHODREGULAR EXTRA PREMIUM Figure 18.8 Gasoline Octane Ratings 363 5/9/08 6:14:16 PM 5/9/08 6:14:16 Sourcebook for Teaching Science Do not change subscripts, because doing so would change the reactants or products that were already established in step II. Identify an element (not an ion or sub-group) that occurs in only one reactant and one product. Balance this element rst because it establishes a ratio that must per-sist through the balancing process. This is a key concept! Repeat the procedure for any other elements that are found in only one reactant or one product, proceeding from those found in the most complex compounds to those found in the simplest. Balance elemental substances (elements that are not bonded to other elements) last, using fractions if necessary. Multiply by the common denominator to remove any fractions. Example 1: Ionic Double - Replacement Reaction The ancient Egyptians used alum (aluminum sul- fate) to purify water and dye fabrics. T oday we use alum in a wide variety of applications, including the treatment of wastewater, production of paper, and manufacture of soaps. I: Word Equation One way to produce alumi- num sulfate is by the reaction of aluminum nitrate with sulfuric acid, producing aluminum sulfate and nitric acid. From this empirically determined information, we can record the reactants (alumi-num nitrate and sulfuric acid) and products (alu-minum sulfate and nitric acid), and draft a word equation: aluminum nitrate sulfuric acid /H11001 aluminum sulfate nitric acid + II: Skeleton Equation Constructing a skel- eton equation requires knowing the formulas for the nitrate and sulfate ions (see the technique in section 18.2 and the data in Table 18.6 ). Second, one must adjust the subscripts of entire ions and subgroups to balance oxidation numbers within reactants and products (section 18.2). For exam-ple, charge is not balanced in our initial expression of aluminum nitrate (three positives and only one negative): Al NO3 3+() We must therefore multiply the entire nitrate ion by three so that the three negative charges from Table 18.6 Common Cation and Anions Common Cations Matter 365 the three nitrates will balance the three positive charges from the one aluminum: Al NO3 33+() Note that one does not change the subscript of oxygen or nitrogen within nitrate because that would indicate a different compound from what is speci ed. Using the same logic we arrive at the formula for aluminum sulfate, Al SO23 42 3+() and eventually the skeleton equation: Al NO H SO3 33 2 42 + + () ( ) + Al SO H NO23 42 33+ + () + Since the charges are balanced and no reactant or product has a net charge, we can rewrite the equation without charges. Al NO H SO Al SO HNO( ) () ()3 3 24 24 3 3/H11001/H11001 III: Balanced Equation Now that we have the correct word equation and skeleton equation, we can proceed to balance the equation. No sub-scripts should be changed because we have already determined the ions and subgroups involved and have made certain they are internally balanced with respect to oxidation number. Now we have to apply the law of conservation of mass to make certain that the mass on the left side of the equa-tion is equal to the mass on the right side of the equation. Since there is no transmutation of ele-ments in chemical reactions, the number of atoms of any element should also be the same on both sides of the equation. We know that our reactants and products are correctly expressed, so the only thing we can change is the coef cients in front of each. We should, if possible, start balancing with an element that occurs in only one reactant and one product. Since the element occurs in only one species on each side of the equation, the ratio is xed. For example, in this reaction, aluminum occurs only in aluminum sulfate and aluminum nitrate. T o balance these, one must put a coef cient of 2 in front of the aluminum nitrate: 213 3 24 24 3 3A l NO H SO Al SO HNO( ) () () /H11001/H11001 This ratio is now xed. Because aluminum occurs nowhere else in the reaction, the ratio must always be 2 aluminum nitrates to 1 aluminum sul-fate. It is helpful to put the coef cient \" 1 \" in front of the aluminum sulfate as a reminder that it has been balanced. Now that this ratio between alumi-num nitrate and aluminum sulfate has been deter-mined and xed, proceed from the most complex substance to the simplest, balancing others that are found in only one reactant and one product. In the sample reaction, three sulfurs are found in aluminum sulfate, so the coef cient \" 3 \" must be placed in front of sulfuric acid, the only place sul-fur occurs on the reactant side of the equation: 23 13 3 24 24 3 3A l NO H SO Al SO HNO( ) () () /H11001/H11001 Nitrogen is also found in only one reactant and one product, so the coef cient 6 must be placed in front of nitric acid to balance. 23 163 3 24 24 3 3A l NO H SO Al SO HNO( ) () () /H11001/H11001 Now there are an equal number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation: Al (2), N (6), S (3), H (6), and O (30). The last two steps of part III are not necessary in this equation since the reaction is balanced. Example 2: Covalent Combustion Reaction We now apply the equation balancing technique to a combustion reaction involving covalent reac-tants and products. Paraf n (C n H 2n/H110012 , where n ranges between 26 and 30) is a long chain hydro-carbon commonly referred to as candle wax. In addition to its well - known application in candles, it is used to seal containers in home canning and c18.indd 365 c18.indd 365 5/9/08 6:14:17 PM 5/9/08 6:14:17 PM366 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science minimize melting in many chocolate candy bars. We examine the combustion of paraf n assuming a 30 - carbon chain. I: Word Equation Experiments show that paraf n combusts in oxygen to produced carbon dioxide and water, so the word equation is: paraf f in /H11001/H11001oxygen carbon dioxide water II: Skeleton Equation Next, we need to express the reactants and products as formulas. Paraf n is a straight chain hydrocarbon with the formula C n H 2n/H110012 where n is equal to 30: C 30 H 62 . Oxygen (O 2 ), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), and water (H 2 O) are well known molecules, with the for- mulas as written. Hence, the skeleton equation becomes: CH O C O H O30 62 2 2 2/H11001/H11001 III: Balanced Equation Carbon and hydro- gen are both found in just one reactant and one product. We will balance carbon rst by multiply- ing carbon dioxide by 30. 13 030 62 2 2 2CH O C O H O /H11001/H11001 Next, we balance the hydrogen by multiplying water by 31: 13 0 3 130 62 2 2 2CH O C O H O /H11001/H11408 /H1100191 2 Oxygen is typically balanced last for the fol- lowing reasons. First, it is highly reactive and is often found in more than one reactant or one product, so there are more variables to contend with. Second, most reactions take place in air, where oxygen is found in elemental form (O 2 ). Elemental forms can be adjusted with fractions without altering the ratios of other substances. Because there is no other element associated with oxygen in its elemental state, any coef cients in front of O 2 will change only oxygen and no other elements. Thus, we can easily make nal adjustments by multiplying elemental oxygen (or other elemental reactants or products) last. In this case, we have 91 oxygens on the right, so we must multiply O 2 by 91/2 to get 91 oxygens on the left. 13 0 3 130 62 2 2 2CH O C O H O /H11001/H11408 /H1100191 2 Although this equation looks awkward, it accu- rately expresses the ratio of paraf n to oxygen nec- essary for a complete combustion to carbon dioxide and water. One mole of paraf n reacts with 45 \u00bd moles of oxygen to produce 30 moles of carbon dioxide and 31 moles of water. Although this ratio is accurate, it is not in standard form. T o present it in standard form, it is necessary to remove all frac-tions by multiplying all coef cients by the common denominator, 2. Hence the nal equation is: 29 1 6 0 6 230 62 2 2 2CH O C O H O /H11001/H11001 There are 60 carbons, 124 hydrogens, and 182 oxygens on both sides, indicating the reaction is balanced. This ratio is easily obtained by this tech-nique but could take an exceptionally long time if not attempted in a logical fashion. Many people avoid using fractions when balancing equations, but that greatly complicates the balancing process. I encourage you to use fractions wherever they are useful, but remember to reduce them before the nal expression of the equation. ACTIVITY 18.3.1 Using Logic to Balance Equations Apply the logic described in this chapter to bal-ance the skeleton equations in Table 18.7 . Do not change any subscripts, because the formulas of each substance have already been determined. It is said that necessity is the mother of invention, but repetition is the mother of skill. The more prob-lems you solve, the stronger skill you will develop. Answers to Chapter Activities 18.1.1 (1) Mg /H110012 yes; (2) S /H11002 Na /H11001/H11001 no; (10) H /H11001 yes. Y ou may want to provide students with Table 18.8 to assist them in this activity. c18.indd 366 c18.indd 366 5/9/08 6:14:18 PM 5/9/08 6:14:18 PMStoichiometry: Interactions of Matter 367 Table 18.7 Skeleton Equations That Need to Be Balanced Part 1 (1-20) Part 2 (21-40) for Oxidation Numbers Classi cation Rule 1 Free elements In free (uncombined) elements, each atom has an oxidation number of zero (0). 2 Monatomic ions For ions composed of only one atom, the oxidation number is equal to the charge on the ion. ions Na/H11001, Ba2/H11001, /H110022, and /H110013, respectively. 3 Fluorine Fluorine is the most electron-negative element and therefore always has an oxidation number of /H110021 in compounds. Each of the other halogens has an oxidation number of /H110021 in binary (compounds that contain only two elements), except when the other element is another halogen above it in the periodic table or when the other element is oxygen. 4 Oxygen The oxidation number of oxygen in most compounds is y2. In peroxides the oxidation number of oxygen is /H110021. 5 Hydrogen The oxidation number of hydrogen is /H110011 in all compounds except metallic compounds (hydrides), in which the oxidation state is /H110021. 6 Neutral compounds The sum of all the oxidation numbers of all the atoms in a neutral compound is zero.7 Polyatomic ions For a polyatomic ion, the algebraic sum of the oxidation numbers must be equal to the ion's charge. For example, consider the ammonium ion, NH 4/H11001. The oxidation number of N is /H110023, and the oxidation number of H is /H110011. The of the oxidation numbers is: /H110023 /H110014 = /H110011, which is equal to the net charge of the ammonium ion as required. 8 Position Since oxidation states are related to the electron structure of the parent element, the posi- tion of an element in the periodic table is related to the possible oxidation state(s) for the element. Group 1 elements (alkali metals) have an oxidation number of /H110011 in compounds, while Group 2 elements (alkaline earth metals) have an oxidation number explained by either a lled octet ( lled s and p - orbitals in a particular shell) or a lled s - orbital as shown in Table 18.9 . 18.2.1 Table 18.10 highlights the true polyatomic ions. The correct answers are in bold. Note that the sum of the oxidation numbers as listed in the right column adds up to the oxidation number attached to the ion. For example the sum of the oxidation states in CO 3 2 /H11002 is /H11002 2 (1 C with and oxidation state of /H110014, plus three oxy- gens with a total charge of /H11002 6 for a net charge of /H11002 2), which matches the charge number attached to the species. We have not indicated the net oxidation numbers for the incorrect substances because in many situations, students may calculate a different number depending un the oxidation numbers they use for those elements with multiple oxidation numbers. 18.2.2 (a) NH 4 NO 3 ; (b) CaCO 3 ; (c) H 2 SO 4 ; (d) Fe 2 O 3 ; (e) Mg(OH) 2 ; (f) AgCl; (g) NaHCO 3 ; (h) Ca 3 (PO 4 ) 2 ; (i) NaNO 2 ; (j) (NH 4 ) 3 PO 4 18.3.1 The answers are in Table 18.11 (part 1) and 18.12 (part 2).

Electronic databases are the most ef cient means of categorizing and retrieving data, and today ' s students bene t when they learn to use this tech- nology to answer real questions and solve practical problems. Photocopy the database commands sec-tion as a reference for your students. Database Commands A database is a structured set of data that can be accessed and analyzed in a variety of ways using a computer. Our economy is dependent on elec-tronic databases. Scienti c databases fuel the research and development of new products and services, and inventory, employee, product, credit, and client databases help bring products to mar-ket. For example, the human genome database is fueling the revolution in biotechnology, and business databases ensure that new biotech prod-ucts are distributed to interested companies and individuals. In this chapter, students use real data to answer practical questions and solve real prob-lems. Because there is a diversity of database soft-ware and because the design of software changes from version to version, the explanations are given in generic terms. If you or your students have questions regarding the mechanics of a particular program, refer to the help menu associated with that software, entering the names of key words shown in italics. Database Software and Files All of the database les found in this chapter can be downloaded from the companion Web site ( sciencesourcebook.com ) as Microsoft Excel or text les. Text les include minimal formatting and can be imported into virtually any database pro-gram. The data printed in the book are excerpted from these les and can be entered manually, should one prefer. Because of its widespread use, Microsoft Excel was chosen to illustrate the Science a lter. A lter is a set of rules used to extract data from the database. Table 19.1 C is a ltered report of a database showing rivers that drain watersheds of more than 3 million square kilom-eters. Filters can be performed sequentially to pro-vide a more speci c subset. For example, a user could lter for rivers draining more than 3 million square kilometers and greater than 4000 kilometers in length. 19.1 Databases in Chemistry Forensic science is the application of science to law. Forensic scientists are used as expert witnesses in court cases to establish facts. A physicist might testify concerning ballistics in a murder trial. A chemist might testify regarding the composi-tion of air or water in an environmental lawsuit. A biologist might testify concerning DNA sam-ples in a biotechnology product dispute. Forensic scientists often make their conclusions by com-paring current observations with ones compiled in a database. For example, a forensic chemist might identify a pollutant by comparing its NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectrum with the NMR spectra of other chemicals catalogued in an NMR database. In this chapter, we use databases to categorize, sort, compare, and analyze information to answer questions and solve problems. ACTIVITY 19.1.1 Choosing the Right Material By 1700, only 14 elements (carbon, sulfur, iron, copper, zinc, arsenic, silver, tin, antimony, gold, mercury, lead, bismuth, and phosphorous) and a few compounds were known. The Industrial Revolution, which began in the eighteenth century, established a demand for new resources and gave incentive for chemists to purify, develop, and clas-sify new materials. The phenomenal expansion in commercial products that occurred in the indus-trial age is a direct result of the development of the chemical and materials sciences. Materials science focuses on the properties of materials that make them suitable for industrial principles of database use. Although Excel is primarily a spreadsheet program, it also has stand-ard database features including the ability to sort, list, group, summarize, select, and lter. T o ensure that data records stick together, rst convert the records to a list. In list format, the top row becomes the column header ( category title ), and each row represents a record. Students will use database commands to solve the problems posed in this section. Following is a list of the essential database features of Excel and similar programs. Review these commands and features prior to performing the activities in this chapter. Finding Records To nd speci c information, perform a nd (search ). Type in a portion or all of the term you are looking for, and the cursor will move to the rst instance. Repeat the nd (search ) to locate other occurrences of the term. Sorting (Arranging) Data Databases allow users to instantly sort ( arrange ) records by cat- egory ( eld ). Table 19.1 A shows a database of the longest rivers in the world sorted by length. These rivers can be sorted in either ascending (A to Z, 0 to 9) or descending (Z to A, 9 to 0) order by river name, length, or volume. Sorting arranges all items with the same entries adjacent to one another and is a prerequisite to grouping. Grouping and Summarizing Data Once data have been sorted, they can be grouped and summarized ( subtotaled ). For example, the river data in Table 19.1 A can be grouped by continent using the subtotal command, and then the user can calculate the desired statistic (e.g., sum, count, average, maximum, minimum ). Table 19.1 B cal- culates the combined ( sum ) length, drainage, and discharge of the longest rivers on each continent. Selecting and Filtering Data In a small database, trends may be apparent, but as the data-base grows, any trends are obscured by the sheer volume of data. Fortunately, it is possible to select records matching speci c criteria by employing c19.indd 375 applications. Chemists have identi ed more than 110 elements and more than 23 million com-pounds, and they are identifying more than 4000 new compounds per day. It is impossible for devel-opers to remember the properties of so many sub-stances, yet they must select the best compounds to produce the best products for today ' s com- petitive market. Developers rely on electronic databases to search for materials with desired characteristics. In this activity, you will use a data-base le of the elements (Table 19.2 ) to search for those with the speci ed properties.

Electronic circuits: When designing electronic circuits, computer hardware engineers must use materials that have extremely high con-ductivity so signals travel easily with little loss of energy. Sort ( arrange ) the database list on electrical conductivity to determine the three best elements for use in electric circuitry. Where are these three elements found in the periodic table? Perform an Internet search to determine if these elements are indeed used in electrical circuits. 2 . Aircraft design: Aircraft designers need materi- als that can withstand extreme temperatures and are lightweight, malleable, and abundant. Determine the element that best ts these cri- teria. Using a lter, select those substances that are metallic (all metals are malleable), have a melting point in excess of 600 K, and have a density less than 3 g/cm 3 . Finally, sort these elements by abundance in the Earth ' s crust to determine which is the most abundant. Which element lls these criteria? Perform an Internet search to determine the element of which most airplanes are made. Is this the same ele-ment you selected using your database lter? 3 . Electric switches: Certain applications require fl uid conductors \u2014 materials that conduct electricity and yet fl ow at room tempera- ture. lter ) for ele- ments with a melting point less than 298 K and a boiling point greater than 298 K. This selects for those elements that are liquid at room temperature, 298 K (25 C). Following this record selection ( lter ), sort descending on electrical conductivity. The element at the top of the list will be the best liquid conductor at room temperature. What is this element? ACTIVITY 19.1.2 Arranging Elements by Physical Properties 1 . Abundance: Coins and jewelry are normally made of rare elements so that they have intrinsic value and are dif cult to counterfeit. By contrast, metals used in construction are abundant and inexpensive, keeping construc-tion costs down. Sort ( arrange ) the elements database (Table 19.2 , available online at science sourcebook.com ) by abundance in the Earth ' s crust and determine if these generalizations hold true. Research the relative abundance of gold, iron, copper, aluminum, silver, and plati-num and determine which are better suited for coins or construction on the basis of this single criteria. 2 . Element symbols: Most element symbols are derived from the rst one or two letters of the element name. For example, the symbol for oxygen is O, and the symbol for helium is He. This is not true for all elements, however. For example, the symbol for potassium is K, even though there is no K in the word. Determine if there is a correlation between the date of dis-covery and the symbol and name convention. Sort ( arrange ) the elements by date of discovery, and compare the element names with the sym-bol names. Is there greater correlation between the names of elements and their symbols for recently discovered elements or for ones discov-ered many years ago? Explain your answer. 3 . Ionization potential: Ionization potential (energy) is the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom. Elements with a low ionization energy easily lose electrons and become cations, while those with high ioniza-tion energy hold on to their valence electrons much more rmly. Where in the periodic table are the elements located that frequently lose valence electrons to become cations? Sort the elemental data from low to high ionization potential ( ascending sort ). Which elements have the lowest ionization energy, and where are they found in the periodic table? Which elements have the highest ionization energy, and where are they found? ACTIVITY 19.1.3 Discovering Family Simi larities Dimitri Mendeleyev, a Russian chemist, cre-ated the rst version of the periodic table of the c19.indd 377 c19.indd 377 5/9/08 6:15:23 PM 5/9/08 6:15:23 Teaching Science elements (Figure 19.1 ) in 1869. When he ordered the elements according to increasing atomic weight in columns so that rows contained analo-gous elements, he saw patterns that allowed him to predict the properties of elements yet to be discov-ered. Mendeleyev ' s task was formidable because there were relatively few data to work with and no electronic tools to organize the information. T oday, however, we have an abundance of infor-mation as well as database tools that allow us to instantly group data by common characteristics. Database technology has fueled the Information Revolution by allowing us to store and examine large amounts of data. In this activity, you will use a database program to separate data by groups and summarize your ndings. Figure 19.1 arranges the elements in terms of increasing atomic number. No patterns or trends are seen when the elements are displayed in this fashion. If, however, elements are arranged as seen in the periodic table, those with similar proper-ties are grouped together. Each column represents a family of elements that have a similar electron con guration and similar chemical properties. Although the periodic table makes it easy to see which elements have similar properties (those in the same family or column), comparing these properties is not easy. By contrast, Table 19.2 lists much speci c information about the properties of the elements but does not allow comparison of family (group) data, unless rst arranged by group. Sort the elements by group. Then calculate average group values for heat of fusion, speci c heat, thermal conductivity, and other properties of your choice using the subtotal command and aver- age option. List your results. 1. Which families are most similar to each other? 2. Which families are most dissimilar to each other? 19.2 Databases in Biology Francis Bacon, one of the most prominent phi- losophers of the scienti c revolution, stated: \" Knowledge is power. \" Bacon ' s axiom resonates today as biological researchers use knowledge to solve real - life problems. Researchers share their ndings, and other researchers use such knowledge to solve additional problems. The data generated are immense, necessitating the use Databases 379 store and analyze the information. In this section, students will analyze databases to answer biologi- cal questions. ACTIVITY 19.2.1 Species Diversity Ecol ogists have identi ed loss of species diversity as one of the largest ecological problems today. T o prevent the extinction of species and loss of spe-cies diversity, it is important to track the health and distribution of species and store the infor-mation in a database from which researchers can retrieve information. Table 19.3 is a database of common and important North American trees. This database le can be downloaded from sciencesourcebook.com . Researchers can add many more categories to this table to include such important details as germination time, pest prob-lems, and life expectancy. The U.S. Department of Agriculture maintains a database that provides a wealth of information for ecologists and other researchers (go to plants.usda.gov , or search \" plants USDA database \" ). 1 1. Which three families have the greatest repre- sentation in the database? Sort ( arrange ) the database according to family. Then perform a subtotal, using the count option to determine the number belonging to each family. 2. Which two genera have the greatest representa- tion? Sort ( arrange ) the database according to genus. Then perform a subtotal function, using the count option to determine the number belonging to each genus. 3. Which family is best represented in the west- ern United States? Sort by the following regions: California (CA), Paci c Northwest (NW), Southwest (SW), and Rocky Mountains (RM). 4. Where are oaks (genus Quercus ) most com- mon? Sort by genus and match with regions. ACTIVITY 19.2.2 Properties of Amino Acids Proteins are necessary for the structure and func-tion of all forms of life. Some proteins serve as enzymes, facilitating biochemical reactions in the body, while others provide cellular structure or serve specialized roles, including immune response. Amino acids are the building blocks of all proteins. The sequence and frequency of amino acids in a protein infl uence its structure and func- tion. Table 19.4 records some of the common properties of amino acids. This database le can be downloaded from sciencesourcebook.com . Use the database commands to answer the following questions: 1. Which amino acids are coded for by these codons: CCU, UAU, UCG, for each codon sequence. 2. What is the rarest polar amino acid in verte- brates? Sort ( arrange ) in ascending polarity, and look for the rst polar amino acid in the list. 3. What percentage of proteins are composed of essential amino acids (those that cannot be synthesized by the human body, but must be acquired in food). Arrange ( sort ) by essential/ nonessential. Perform a subtotal of the average percentage composition at each change in the \" essential \" category. 4. Which amino acids compose less than 7 per- cent of proteins in vertebrates, are neutral, and are polar? Perform three successive lters (less than 7 percent, neutral, and polar). Make certain to show all records before performing subsequent operations, or you will be working only with the results of the lter. 5. Which amino acid has a molecular weight greater than 150 g/mole, is polar, and is neu-tral? Perform three successive lters (mass greater than 150, polar, neutral). Make certain to show all records before performing subse- quent operations. ACTIVITY 19.2.3 Human Genome The Human Genome Project has discovered approximately 25,000 human genes and 3 billion DNA subunits, and it has published much of this information on the Internet through online data-bases, such as the human genome database (gene map of the human genome) provided by National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). 2 379 PM380 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Family Genus Species Common Name NE SE CN NW CA SW RM Cupressaceae Chamaecyparis nootkatensis Alaska-cedar Tilia americana 1 1 1 Aquifoliaceae Ilex opaca American holly 1 Cupressaceae Cupress us arizonica Arizona cypress 1 Cupressaceae Taxodi um distich ut1 bl ue Cupressaceae Juniper us comm unis common j uniper 1 1 1 1 Pinaceae Pseudotsuga menziesii Douglas fir 1 1 1 Pinaceae Picea en gelmannii Engelmann spr uoia 1 Leguminosae Gleditsia urrens incense-cedar 1 pine 1 1 1 1 1 1 Cupressaceae occidentalis northern white cedar 1 Hippocastanaceae Aesc aspen 1 pine 1 Pinaceae 1 Aceraceae 1 sitchensis spr Fagaceae Quercus falcata southern red oak 1 1 Acer sacchar um sugar maple 1 upelo hemlock 1 1 Cupressaceae Thuja plicata western red cedar 1 1 Oleaceae Fraxin us americana white ash 1 1 1 Pinaceae Abies concolor white fir 1 1 1 1 Fagaceae Quercus alba white oak 1 1 pine 1 1 Note: NE = Northeast, SE = Southeast, CN = Canada, NW = Northwest, CA = California, SW = Southwest, RM = Rocky Mountains.Table 19.3 Database of Common North American Trees c19.indd 380 5/9/08 6:15:27 PM 5/9/08 6:15:27 PMScientific Databases 381 1. Using information gathered from a general Internet search, summarize the nature of the following genetic disorders: cystic brosis, achondroplasia, albinism, and hemochroma-tosis. Locate the gene that results in each dis-order by performing a search using the online human genome database (see sciencesource book.com , www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov \" human genome database \" ). Print out a gene map showing the location of each gene on its chromosome. 2. Many conditions result from the insuf ciency or overproduction of hormones. For example, diabetes results from an insuf ciency of insu- lin. Print out a gene map showing the location of a gene responsible for insulin production. 3. Congenital hypothyroidism is a condition that affects infants from birth and results from a partial or complete loss of thyroid function (hypothyroidism). Its symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, and weight gain since thy-roxin, the hormone of the thyroid gland, controls metabolism and is lacking in such indi-viduals. Mutations in the PAX8, genes cause congenital hypothyroidism. Print a gene map showing the location on chromosomes of one or more genes that may lead to hypothyroidism. ACTIVITY 19.2.4 Protein Structure Proteins are essential to the structure and function of all living cells. Some proteins are enzymes or antibodies, and others serve structural, mechani-cal, or storage roles. Biological and medical researchers are extremely interested in the shapes of proteins because structure determines func-tion. The Protein Data Bank is a repository for the processing and distribution of the three - dimen-sional structure of proteins (look on sciencesource book.com or www.pdb.org , or search \" protein data bank \" ). 3 Search the Protein Data Bank for the fol- lowing proteins using the PDB code listed in capi-tal letters. Each is viewable in three dimensions and can be rotated and enlarged within a Web browser. Print pictures of the three - dimensional structure of each of the following: 1. Insulin 3INS (hormone used in 4.4% N Histidine 155 2.9% polar weakly basic CAU, CAC Y ile nonpolar ne 149 PM 5/9/08 Sourcebook 2. Hemoglobin 1GZX (oxygen - carrying mol- ecule in the blood) 3. Ferritin 1AEW (iron reservoir in the spleen) 4. Manganese peroxidase 1MNP (an enzyme for breaking down peroxides) 5. NS1 - protein 1AIL (a protein from fl u virus) ACTIVITY 19.2.5 Classi cation and Taxonomy Plants provide us with food, wood, paper, medicines, oxygen, and many other essential or useful products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) main-tains the online Plants Database (plants.usda.gov) from which users can nd the distribution, classi - cation, and use of plants found in North America. 1. Using this online database, obtain a picture and record the classi cation (kingdom, division, class, order, family, genus, species) and distribu-tion (states in which they grow) of the following record - holding tree species: (a) giant redwood ( Sequoiadendron ( Sequoia sempervirens ), the tallest living thing. What similarities, if any, exist in the classi ca- tion and distribution of these species? Include photographs and distribution maps of each. 2. Using the Plants Database, obtain a picture, and record the classi cation (kingdom, divi- sion, class, order, family, genus, species) and distribution (states in which they grow) of your state fl ower and tree. 19.3 Databases in Health Americans are preoccupied with losing weight and staying healthy, and a multibillion dollar diet food industry has developed to feed this preoccu-pation. The South Beach, Atkins, Slim Fast, and 3 - Day diets are a few of the hundreds of plans that have been developed to help people reduce weight and stay healthy. Dietitians have developed plans using databases such as that shown in Table 19.5 (download this le from sciencesourcebook.com ), selecting foods that meet speci c nutritional cri- teria. The activities in this section show how dieti-tians or consumers may use a database of foods to analyze content and assemble appropriate diets. Contact a professional before making any major dietary decisions. The activities in this sec-tion are merely for the purpose of illustration. ACTIVITY 19.3.1 Selecting Foods to Reduce the Risk of Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is a metabolic disease in which bones become porous. Approximately 10 million Americans suffer from this debilitating disease with symptoms that include curvature of the spine and bone fractures. Although osteoporosis is often considered to be a disease of the elderly, steps to prevent it can be taken throughout life. Medical researchers have shown that osteoporosis results from an insuf ciency of calcium during the grow- ing years as well as later in life. Nutrition experts agree that the best way to prevent nutrient de ciencies is to eat a balanced diet. However, an individual who is showing symptoms of calcium de ciency may be advised to increase his or her dietary intake. Calcium is best absorbed in foods that contain approximately equivalent amounts of calcium and phospho-rous. Vitamin D is known to aid calcium absorp-tion, and excessive dietary protein reduces it. The nutritional database (Table 19.5 , which you can download from sciencesourcebook.com ) provides information about the composition of some com-mon foods. Y our goal is to determine foods to rec-ommend to an individual showing symptoms of calcium de ciency. Y ou will need to select foods that (a) are high in calcium, (b) have moderate to low protein content, and (c) have a calcium - to - phosphorous ratio of approximately 1:1. 1. (a) Select ( lter) for those foods with more than 25 mg of calcium per serving size. (b) Select ( lter) for those foods with a protein con- tent less than 10 g/serving (c) and a calcium/ phosphorus ratio between 0.7 and 1.3. ACTIVITY 19.3.2 Selecting Foods to Reduce the Threat of Cardiovascular Disease More than half of American adults die from some form of cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart fail-ure, aneurysms, strokes) in which the heart or 5/9/08 6:15:28 PM 5/9/08 6:15:28 PMScientific Databases 383 blood vessels, or both, fail to function properly. The underlying cause for many cardiovascular conditions is atherosclerosis (sometimes referred to as hardening of the arteries). In atheroscle-rosis, fats accumulate on the inner walls of ves-sels, reducing their fl exibility and restricting blood fl ow. As a result of increased resistance, the heart generates greater pressure to ensure that Table 19.5 Nutrition DataFood Serving Size Calcium [mg] Energy [kcal] Protein [g] Carbohydrate Cholesterol [mg] Vit C [mg] Food type apple 1 ea 10 80 0.3 21.0 0.0 0.5 0.1 0.1 1 10 1 0.11 0.02 0.02 7 0.07 8 fr apple pie 1 slice 403 3.0 60.0 0.0 18.0 4.2 4.9 474 50 0.06 1.59 0.17 0.13 29 0.09 0 bg asparagus 1/2 cup 22 22 2.3 4.0 0.0 0.3 0.1 0.1 4 55 0.4 0.95 0.09 0.11 75 0.13 25 vavocado 1 ea 19 305 4.0 12.0 0.0 30.0 4.5 3.5 21 73 0.26 3.32 0.19 0.21 106 0.48 14 fr bacon 3 pce 2 109 5.8 0.1 16.0 9.3 3.3 1.1 303 64 0.03 1.39 0.13 0.05 0 0.05 6 m bagel, plain 1 ea 29 200 7.5 38.2 0.0 1.8 0.3 0.7 245 46 0.63 2.4 0.26 0.2 0 0.03 0 bg banana 1 ea 73 105 1.2 26.7 0.0 0.5 0.2 0.1 1 22 0.32 0.62 0.05 0.11 9 0.66 10 165 390 21.0 40.0 52.0 17.5 6.8 2.3 516 274 0.6 4.36 0.26 0.29 58 0.73 5 mxbroccoli 1 spear 205 53 5.3 10.0 0.0 0.5 0.1 0.2 20 86 2.38 1.36 0.15 0.37 254 0.36 113 v canned pudding 5 oz 74 205 3.0 30.0 1.0 11.0 9.5 0.1 285 117 0.63 0.6 0.04 0.17 31 0.03 0 d cantaloupe 1/2 ea 29 94 2.4 22.3 0.0 0.7 0.1 0.2 24 45 0.64 1.53 0.1 0.06 861 0.31 113 frcheese crackers 10 ea 11 50 1.0 6.0 6.0 3.0 0.9 0.3 112 17 0.65 0.4 0.05 0.04 5 0.01 0 bg chicken 1 cup 21 266 40.5 0.0 125.0 10.4 2.9 2.4 120 273 0.08 12.8 0.1 0.25 22 0.65 0 p choc.chip cookies 4 ea 16 180 2.3 28.0 5.0 8.8 2.9 2.6 140 41 0.39 0.9 0.1 0.23 15 0.02 0 bg cole slaw 1 cup 54 84 1.5 14.9 10.0 3.1 0.5 1.6 28 38 1.42 0.33 0.08 0.07 98 0.17 39 mx corn 1 ear 2 83 2.6 19.4 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.5 13 79 0.03 1.24 0.17 0.06 17 0.18 5 v corn chips 1 oz 35 155 2.0 16.0 0.0 9.0 1.4 3.7 233 52 0.67 0.4 0.04 0.05 11 0.04 1 bg corn dog 1 ea 34 330 10.0 27.3 37.0 20.0 8.4 1.4 1252 303 0.11 3.27 0.28 0.17 0 0.11 3 mx cottage cheese 1 cup 126 215 26.2 5.6 31.0 8.9 6.0 0.3 850 277 0.45 0.27 0.04 0.34 101 0.14 0 d duck 1/2 duck 27 445 51.9 0.0 198.0 24.8 9.2 3.1 143 449 0.06 11.3 0.57 1.04 51 0.55 0 p egg noodles 1 cup 16 200 6.6 37.3 50.0 2.0 0.5 0.6 3 94 0.17 1.9 0.22 0.13 34 0.01 0 geggplant 1 cup 10 45 1.3 10.6 0.0 0.4 0.1 0.1 5 35 0.29 0.96 0.12 0.03 10 0.14 2 veggs 1 ea 54 95 6.0 1.4 282.0 7.1 3.0 0.8 176 109 0.5 0.04 0.04 0.18 102 0.06 0 e enchilada 1 ea 322 16.0 7.7 0.6 1332 198 1.63 0 0.18 0.26 352 0.25 0 mx english muffin 1 ea 96 140 4.5 26.2 0.0 1.1 0.3 0.3 378 67 1.43 2.14 0.26 0.18 0 0.02 0 bgfish sticks 2 ea 22 140 12.0 8.0 52.0 6.0 1.6 1.6 106 116 0.19 1.2 0.06 0.1 10 0.12 0 ffrankfurter 1 ea 5 145 5.1 1.1 23.0 13.1 4.8 1.2 504 39 0.13 1.18 0.09 0.05 0 0.06 12 mfrench fries 10 strips 10 158 2.0 19.8 0.0 8.3 2.5 3.8 108 47 0.21 1.63 0.09 0.01 0 0.12 5 v graham crackers 2 ea 6 60 1.0 10.8 0.0 1.5 0.4 0.4 86 20 0.3 0.6 0.02 0.03 0 0.01 0 bg Grape-Nuts cereal 1/2 cup 22 202 6.6 26.4 0.0 0.2 0.0 0.2 394 142 0.15 10 0.8 0.8 753 1 0 g ground beef lean 3 oz 9 230 21.0 0.0 74.0 16.0 6.2 0.6 65 134 0.07 4.4 0.04 0.18 0 0.39 0 m ground beef regular 3 oz 9 245 20.0 0.0 76.0 17.8 6.9 0.7 70 144 0.06 4.9 0.03 0.16 0 0.39 0 m ham 1 pce 1 70 2.6 0.4 13.0 6.4 2.3 0.8 271 17 0.06 0.66 0.08 0.04 0 0.04 0 m honey dew 1 pce 8 45 0.6 11.8 0.0 0.1 0.0 0.0 13 13 0.62 0.77 0.1 0.02 5 0.08 32 fr ice cream 1 cup 351 269 4.8 31.8 60.0 14.4 8.9 0.5 116 134 2.62 0.14 0.05 0.33 133 0.06 1 d lima beans 1/2 cup 19 85 5.2 16.0 0.0 0.3 0.1 0.1 45 54 0.35 0.91 0.06 0.05 16 0.1 11 vliver 3 oz 9 185 23.0 7.0 410.0 7.0 2.5 1.3 90 392 0.02 12.3 0.18 3.52 9120 0.31 23 m macaroni 1 cup 14 190 6.5 39.1 0.0 0.7 0.1 0.3 1 85 0.16 1.82 0.23 0.13 0 0.1 0 g melba toast 1 pce 6 20 1.0 4.0 0.0 0.3 0.1 0.1 44 10 0.6 0.1 0.01 0.01 0 0.01 0 bg milk -

Unfortunately this extra stress on the heart can cause it to wear out faster. Excessively high blood pressure may cause vessels to balloon at points of weakness. Such enlargements are known as aneu-rysms and may burst and lead to substantial inter-nal bleeding. Finally, atherosclerosis may stimulate the formation of blood clots. Such clots cause the death of tissue when they block blood fl ow. Clots in the brain cause strokes, and those in the coro-nary artery cause heart attacks. Fortunately, we know dietary risk factors asso- ciated with cardiovascular disease and can reduce the risk by minimizing certain foods in our diets. Many physicians recommend that patients substi-tute polyunsaturated for saturated fats (increase unsaturated - to - saturated ratio), reduce sodium intake, and minimize cholesterol. Determine foods that should be minimized or eliminated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. 1. (a) De ne a new category ( insert column ) for the ratio of unsaturated - to - saturated fat. De ne the rst cell as the ratio of unsaturated fat to saturated fat for that record (divide the unsaturated fat cell by the saturated fat cell), and copy this formula relatively (to refl ect the contents of each record) to all other records in the column (Table 19.6 ). Perform a lter ( record selection ) for foods with a unsaturated to saturated fat ratio less than or equal to 0.3. (b) Perform a lter ( record selection ) for foods with a sodium content greater than 100 mg/ serving. (c) Perform a lter ( record selection ) for foods with cholesterol greater than 10 mg/ serving size. Include a printout of the foods that meet all three criteria. These foods should be minimized or eliminated in diets of those who are at risk of cardiovascular disease. What are these foods?

ACTIVITY 19.3.3 Selecting Foods to Treat Vitamin De ciencies Researchers have linked vitamin de ciencies with speci c syndromes listed below: Vitamin De ciency Syndromes Vitamin A night blindness; brittle skin; damaged respiratory tract Thiamin (B 1 ) beriberi (muscle atrophy, paralysis, congestive heart failure) R i b o fl avin (B 2 ) dermatitis, mental confu- sion, irritability) Vitamin B 6 dermatitis, irritation of sweat glands, convulsions Vitamin C scurvy (bleeding gums, anemia, painful joints, poor healing) 1. Using a database program and the nutrition database (Table 19.5 ), determine three foods that a nutritionist might recommend to allevi-ate or eliminate each of the syndromes listed. This information can be obtained by perform-ing a descending sort according to the vitamin in question.

If an individual con-sumes more calories than necessary, excess energy will be stored as fat. Although a certain amount of fat is essential, excessive quantities may contribute to a variety of physical problems. People who have dif culty maintaining their weight below recom- mended values should reduce their caloric intake. ( Note: The following are for illustration purposes only. Consult a professional dietitian to construct the appropriate diet to meet your needs.) 1. Using the database in Table 19.5 , sort ( arrange ) foods in descending order of caloric content per serving. Which ve foods have the great- est caloric value per serving size? Which food group(s) do these foods represent (g - grain, p - poultry, fr - fruit, bg - baked goods, mx - mixed, v - vegetables, m - meat, d - dessert)? Do these results surprise you, or are they what you expect? Explain. 2. Construct a list of foods that have high vita- min content while offering a minimum of calories. Select three vitamins (A, C, ribofl a- vin, niacin, B 6 ), and perform three successive lters ( record selections ) for foods that exceed the following values per serving size: vitamin C (10 mg), vitamin A (120 RE), ribofl avin (0.30 mg), niacin (2.4 mg), vitamin B 6 (.30). Sort ( arrange ) this list in ascending order in terms of calories per serving size. What ve foods in your list have the lowest caloric con-tent? Which food group(s) do these foods represent? People struggling to reduce their weight should consider including these in their diet. ACTIVITY 19.3.5 Analyze Your Diet How balanced is your diet? Record the quantities of all foods you eat in a typical day. Enter these values into an Internet - based nutritional analysis service such as the Nutritional Analysis T ool (look on science sourcebook.com or nat.crgq.com , or search \" nutri- tional analysis tool \" ). 4 Analyze your diet with respect to the USDA recommended daily allowances (RDA). 1. Generate a graph or table of your diet (Figure 19.2 ), and write a brief analysis, highlight-ing areas where your diet deviates signi - cantly from the USDA ' s recommended daily allowances. 2. What can you do to improve your nutrition? 19.4 Databases in Earth and Space Science For years, the International Star Registry has advertised that it will name a star after you or a loved one for a nominal fee. Although it claims to have \" named \" over a million stars, the only place where such names are recognized is in its own book, for the ISR is a private company with no authority to name stars.

The precise coordinates and details of stars are recorded in databases. It appears as though the International Star Registry and other entrepreneurs have the poten-tial to make much more money since astronomers estimate that there are more than 200 billion stars in the universe (some estimate as many as 3000 mil-lion billion!). In the activities that follow, students will use databases to answer questions about objects closer to home: planets, asteroids, and Earth. ACTIVITY 19.4.1 Comparing and Con trast ing the Properties of the Planets Astron omy books group the inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) separately from the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). Are there any characteristics the inner planets share other than their proximity to the Sun? Are there any characteristics the outer planets share other than their great distance from the Sun? Table 19.7 is a summary of planetary data arranged so one can sort according to a variety of characteristics (the le can be downloaded from sciencesourcebook.com ). The outer planets are itali- cized. Sort ( arrange ) the planet database on each characteristic, and examine the listing for similari-ties within the two groups. 1. Identify properties that characterize the inner planets and outer planets.

Identify properties that cannot be used to dif- ferentiate inner and outer planets. ACTIVITY 19.4.2 Analyzing Asteroids Asteroids (Figure 19.3 A) are rocky or metallic objects that orbit the Sun but are much smaller than planets. Most asteroids orbit the Sun in a belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, but some have eccentric orbits, and occasionally one has an orbit that intersects the orbit of earth. The Barringer meteor crater near Winslow, Arizona (Figure 19.3 B), is evidence of such a path. Figure 19.3 C lists the largest asteroids, their date of dis-covery, distance from the sun (in astronomical units (au); 1 au = distance from the Sun to Earth), and orbital period (years). This le can be down- loaded from sciencesourcebook.com . 1. Is there any relationship between the distance from the Sun and the time it takes to orbit (orbital period)? Explain your answer. T o see if such a relationship exists, sort the asteroids in ascending order of distance from the Sun, and look for trends in orbital period. 2. Is there any relationship between the size of an asteroid and its date of discovery? Explain your answer. Sort asteroids in ascending order of discovery date and compare with diameter. ACTIVITY 19.4.3 Comparing and Contrast ing Natural Disasters Earth scientists study disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes (cyclones, typhoons), drought. Table 19.8 lists the 30 worst natural disasters of the twentieth century. 1. Of the events listed, which type of disaster caused the greatest loss of life in the twenti-eth century? T o determine this, perform an ascending sort on the type of disaster; then perform a subtotal/sum after each group of disasters to calculate the loss of life from each. 2. Which countries suffered most from natural disasters in the twentieth century? Perform an ascending sort on the country and a subtotal/ sum on deaths, grouping by country, to calcu- late the loss of life per country. 19.5 Databases in Physics Physicists use databases to record and access experimental data and analyze the ndings of others. In this section, we explore two very different uses of databases in physics. Activity 19.5.1 looks at the classi cation of subatomic par- ticles, and Activity 19.5.2 looks at the interaction of discoveries in physics and the inventions they lead to. ACTIVITY 19.5.1 Classi cation of Suba tomic Particles Recent developments in sub atomic theory have changed our perception of the nature of matter. Rather than just three fundamental particles (neu-trons, electrons, protons), nuclear physicists now believe there are 12 or more, including 6 leptons and 6 quarks (Table 19.9 , which you can down-load from sciencesourcebook.com ). The electron, which is a type of lepton, is fundamental (com-posed of no other particles). Protons and neutrons are not fundamental because they are composed of quarks. The eld of particle physics is changing Name discovered 114 226 312 174 246 190 272 236 61 33 180 4.62.77 2.772.672.362.392.433.142.582.642.912.922.553.162.77 2.72 3.11 3.10 (B) Meteor Crater.

Originally subatomic particles were classi ed on the basis of their masses. The tiniest particles were known as leptons ( lep - means \" small \" in Greek), and the heaviest particles were classi ed as baryons ( bary - means \" heavy \" in Greek). Particles of intermediate size were termed mesons ( mes - means \" middle \" in Greek). 1. Is the original classi cation scheme of suba- tomic particles still applicable? Sort subatomic particles in the table in ascending order accord- ing to mass. Are baryons always the heavi-est particles and leptons the lightest? Is the original classi cation scheme still relevant? Explain. ACTIVITY 19.5.2 Discovering the Inter action of Discoveries and Inventions Isaac Newton, one of the greatest physicists of all time, wrote in a letter to a colleague, \" If I have been able to see further, it was only because I stood on the shoulders of giants. \" Indeed, Newton made his discoveries not in a vacuum, but only after analyzing the observations, data, and writ-ings of his predecessors and colleagues. T oday ' s breakthroughs are possible because modern sci-entists, engineers, and inventors are also \" stand-ing on the shoulders of giants. \" Table 19.10 (which you can download from sciencesourcebook.com ) lists a few of the giants in the history of physics. Each of these scientists made one or more sig-ni cant contributions that facilitated the work of others. For example, the invention of the radio by Guglielmo Marconi in 1896 would have been impossible without the discovery and research of Michael Faraday, James Maxwell, Heinrich Hertz, Oliver Lodge, and Nikola T esla. 1. Create a time line of discoveries in physics by sorting the table in ascending order by the year the invention was made. 2. Discoveries in science are made only when the appropriate technology is available, and these discoveries can lead to the develop-ment of new technologies. Table 19.10 lists some signi cant inventions and discover-ies made during the past ve centuries. Sort the database in an ascending order by date of discovery or invention. Identify discoveries or inventions that were necessary to lead to other discoveries or inventions. Answers to Chapter Activities 19.1.1 (1) Silver, copper, and gold. These elements are located in the same family within the transition elements. Copper is the most commonly used element in house-hold circuits. Silver and gold are used in computer cir-cuitry and other specialty applications. (2) Aluminum ts these criteria and is the most common element in the construction of airplanes. (3) Mercury is frequently used as a fl uid conductor. 19.1.2 (1) Copper, silver, gold, and platinum are rare metals and are used in coins and jewelry. Iron and aluminum are common metals and are frequently used in con-struction. (2) Elements discovered many years ago, such as lead (Pb), gold (Au), and iron (Fe), have sym-bols that do not match their names. This is because the symbol convention was adopted before the English names were. Plumbum was the original Latin name for lead, and thus the symbol Pb was adopted. Similarly, aurum (Au) was the Latin name for gold and argentum (Ag) for silver. (3) The elements with the highest ioni-zation energies are the noble gases, found in the right - hand column of the periodic table. Elements with the lowest ionization energies are found in the rst family, the alkali metals. 19.1.3 (1) The alkali metals (family 1) and alkaline earths (family 2) are more similar to each other than are other families. (2) The alkali metals and the halogens are the most dissimilar. 19.2.1 (1) Pinaceae, Cupressaceae, Fagaceae. (2) Pinus (pine) and Quercus (oak). (3) will access the human genome database, search for the information listed, and nd maps show- ing the locations of the various traits listed. 19.2.4 Each of these is a complex protein and will appear dif- ferently depending on the perspective viewed when printing. Emphasize that the structure of a protein determines its function (see section 12.4). 19.2.5 (1) All three of these are conifers in the order Pinales. The bristlecone pine is in Pinaceae, and the two red-woods are in Cupressaceae. All three are native to California. The bristlecone pine is also found on desert mountain ranges in the Great Basin. (2) Students will print the picture, classi cation, and distribution of each species. 19.3.1 (1) The list may include foods such as strawberries, white bread, yogurt, and milk. c19.indd 389 c19.indd 389 5/9/08 6:15:31 PM 5/9/08 6:15:31 Nicholas Copernic us heliocentic theory 1577 Tycho Brahe 1589 Galileo Galilei acceleration st udies 1590 Zacharias Janssen compo Hans Evan 1645 Otto von pump 1656 Isaac Newton calc ulus 1668 John Wallis law of conservation of moment um 1668 Isaac Newton reflectin g telescope 1672 Isaac Newton theory of li ght and colors 1678 Christian H uygens principle of wavefront so urces 1684 Isaac Newton Kepler's Laws proved 1698 Thomas Savery steam p ump 1705 Edmond Halley periodicity Halley's comet proposed1712 Thomas Newcomen steam en gine 1724 Gabriel Fahrenheit merc ury thermometer 1769 James Watt improved steam en gine 1786 John Fitch steam en gine 1798 Henry Cavendish the mass of the Earth1799 Alessandro Volta battery 1801 Thomas Yo ung wave nat ure of li ght, interference 1814 Geor ge Stephenson steam locomotive 1814 Joseph Niepce camera 1820 Lo uis Ampere electric c urrents exert force 1820 Hans Christian Oersted electricity and ma gnetism related 1821 Michael electrical resistance 1831 Michael Faraday electroma gnetic ind uction 1837 Sam uel Morse tele graph 1843 James Jo ule heat is a form of ener gy 1848 Lord Kelvin absol ute zero 1873 James Maxwell li ght is electroma gnetism 1904 Christian H ulsmeyer radar1888 Heinrich Hertz radio waves discovered 1888 Nicola Tesla AC motor & transformer 1896 radioactivity 1896 G uglielmo Marconi radio 1897 Joseph Thomson electron discovered1899 Ernest R utheford alpha and beta particles 1923 Vladimir Zworykin cathode ray t ube 1928 Edwin Land polarization 1930 Vannever B ush comp uter 1932 James Chadwick ne utron 1932 Carl Anderson positron 1933 Wolf gang Pauli ne utrinos 1942 Enrico Fermi first controlled n uclear chain reaction 1945 Manhattan Project atomic bomb 1947 Barden Brattain, Schoclkey transistor 1954 Chaplin, F uller, Pearson 1958 Jack Kilby, Robert Noyce circ ur Cray s uper comp uter 1990 Tim Berners Lee World Wide Web protocolTable 19.10 Discoveries and Inventions in Physics in the Past 500 Years c19.indd 390 Cupressaceae Pinaceae Cupressaceae G e n u s S e q u o i a d e n d r o n P i n u s S e q u o i a S p e c i e s g i g a n t e u m l o n g a e v a s e m p e r v i r e n s 19.3.2 (1) The list of foods to avoid may include eggs, ice cream, corn dogs, cottage cheese, yogurt, frankfurters, enchiladas, and bacon. 19.3.3 (1) vitamin A (liver, cantaloupe, Grape - Nuts), thiamin B 1 (pork, white rice, Grape - Nuts), ribofl avin B 2 (liver, duck, Grape-Nuts), niacin (chicken, liver, duck, Grape - Nuts), vitamin B 6 (Grape - Nuts, beef burrito, banana), vitamin C (orange juice, broccoli, cantaloupe). 19.3.4 (1) white rice, duck, raisins, apple pie, beef burrito, representing a variety of food groups.

That changed in 1979 with the release of VisiCalc, the world ' s rst electronic spreadsheet for personal computers. Although it resembled a traditional accounting ledger, VisiCalc performed operations auto matically, based on for- mulas entered by the user. Calculations that would normally take hours could now be performed in sec-onds. Immediately scientists, engineers, and others recognized the potential for personal computers, fueling the personal computer revolution. The electronic spreadsheet has stimulated dra- matic growth in scienti c research by freeing sci- entists from tedious calculations, allowing them to focus their time and efforts generating hypotheses, designing and conducting experiments, and evalu-ating results. Modern spreadsheet programs can be used to perform calculations, graph data, and organize information. They are an essential tool for students of science, as well as scienti c researchers. The information in this section is applicable to all common spreadsheet programs, but the examples and les downloadable from sciencesourcebook. com were made using Microsoft Excel. In this chapter, students will learn how to use spreadsheet c20.indd 392 c20.indd 392 5/9/08 11:28:26 AM 5/9/08 11:28:26 AMSpreadsheets, Graphs, and Scientif ic Data Analysis 393 questions. Search the help menus of your software for the terms and concepts written in italics in this chapter. Spreadsheet Basics The activities in this chapter use basic mathematics operations. Note that the keys for addition, sub-traction, multiplication, division, exponent, and scienti c notation are /H11001 , tively (Figure 20.1B ). The order of operation (sequence in which calculations are performed within a cell) is algebraic (Figure 20.1C ). programs to record, graph, and analyze laboratory data and other scienti c information. Such skills are invaluable to students in the Information Age. All of the exercises in this chapter employ scien- ti c data and can be used to teach science concepts. Although there is discussion regarding spreadsheet mechanics, the emphasis is on using spreadsheets to analyze and interpret scienti c data the way sci- enti c researchers do. Mechanics vary by spread- sheet programs and versions of programs. As a result, I have not included speci c mechanics in this chapter, but rather encourage students to use the software help menu for program - speci c Group Range Percent Power Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction ( ) : % ^ * / + -COrder of operation AVERAGE Calculates the average for a range or list of cells COS Calculates the cosine of a value or cell COUNT Counts the cells that are lled with numbers in a range MAX Calculates the highest value in a list or range MIN Calculates the lowest value in a list or range SIN Calculates the sine of a value or cell SQRT Calculates the square root of a value or cell SUM Calculates the sum for a range or list of cells TAN Calculates the tangent of a value or cellDCommon spreadsheet functions cell name formula bar column (category) headings active cell cell handlerow (record) headings worksheet division exponent scientic notation +- * / ^ EBKeyboard symbols for mathematical operations Figure 20.1 (A) Spreadsheet.

For exam- ple, /H11005COS(D5) returns the value for the cosine of the contents of cell D5. A range of variables is des-ignated by a colon (:) between the beginning and ending cells. For example, /H11005SUM(B4:B12) gives the sum of all values between B4 and B12. One can also specify a series of values by separating them with commas. For example, /H11005SUM(B6,B9) delivers the sum of these two cells, and /H11005SUM(B6,B7,B10: B12) delivers the sum of the two individual cells, B6 and B7, and the sum of the range from B10 to B12. Figure 20.1D lists the most frequently used functions in teaching science. Spreadsheets allow formulas to be copied to adja- cent cells. In general, formulas are copied relatively, meaning that the copied formula is adjusted relative to its new position. For example, if the formula /H11005B4/B13 is copied down a cell, it will be B5/B14. Similarly, if it is copied up a cell, it will have the value B3/B12. If you want part of the formula to refer to a speci c cell so the reference does not change when copied, it is necessary to use an absolute reference, indicated by a dollar sign ( $ ). For example, if the formula /H11005B4/ $ B $ 13 is copied down a cell, the rst value changes relatively, while the second remains the same, /H11005B5/ $ B $ 13. Although all spreadsheet programs have the same fundamental capabilities, they differ in mechanics, and as a result this chapter provides only generic instructions. T o plot data, the user must select relevant cells and the desired graph format (e.g., bar, line, X - Y). Once a graph has been made, the user may rede ne the source data (location of data series, x - values, y - values ), titles ( chart title, x - axis title, y - axis title ), axes, gridlines, legends, and data labels. In most programs, users can change a feature by selecting it (right - or double - clicking on it) and choosing the options that accompany the contextual menu that appears. In this chapter, students gain competence devel- oping and interpreting the most common types of tables and graphs used in science (Table 20.1 ). Tables are best when precision is required, and graphs are best when the need is to make quantita- tive comparisons or see trends and relationships. However, if a user wants to show spatial relation-ships, it is better to use maps ; to show nonquanti- tative relationships, diagrams are best. Charts can be used for a wide range of purposes. Spreadsheet programs generate tables, graphs, and charts. 20.1 Calculations and Computer Modeling An electronic spreadsheet, such as Microsoft Excel, presents data in worksheets (Figure 20.1A ), docu- ments that can store, manipulate, calculate, and analyze data. Data are placed in cells formed at the intersection of columns and rows. Cells can hold numbers, formulas, or labels. The address or refer- ence of a cell is the combination of the column and row headings. For example, the address B5 refers to data found at the intersection of the column B and Table 20.1 Different Types of Visual Representation Table Graph Map Diagram Chart Key features precision of informationquantitative comparisonspatial relationshipsnonquantitative relationshipsvariable Examples frequency AMSpreadsheets, Graphs, and Scientif ic Data Analysis 395 row 5. Cells may contain formulas linked to the contents of other cells. For example, the formula /H11005A5 /H11001 B5 refers to the sum of the contents of cells A5 and B5. When the value of a cell is changed, all cells with formulas referring to that cell are updated. Note that the keys for addition, subtrac- tion, multiplication, division, exponent, and , /H11002 , * , /, ^, and E, respectively. Figure 20.2 is a spreadsheet that shows a vari- ety of calculations common in science. The shaded boxes on the right side of the spreadsheet reveal the formulas that are embedded in the boxed cells immediately to their left. The temperature con-version equations convert Fahrenheit to Celsius (Figure 20.2A ). T o convert, one must rst subtract 32 F, then multiply by 5/9. The formula in D3 reads /H11005(B3 - 32) * 5/9, where B3 represents the Fahrenheit temperature in cell B3 and * indicates multiplica-tion. The formulas in cells D4 and D5 parallel D3, referencing the temperatures in B4 and B5. The formula for calculating the distance an object travels in free fall is d /H11005 1/2 gt 2 , where g is the acceleration due to gravity and t is the elapsed time (Figure 20.2B ). The formula in D9 is /H110051/2 * $ B $ 9 * (C9)^2. Since g (the accel- eration due to gravity) does not change, the for-mulas for D10 ( /H110051/2 * $ B $ 9 * (C10)^2) and D11 (/H110051/2 * $ B $ 9 * (C11)^2) both refer to B9 where the value of g is found. A dollar sign ( $ ) in a cell refer- ence makes it an absolute reference for the purpose of copying. If the formula is copied to another cell, $ B $ 9 remains the same, while the other reference (C9) changes to C10 or C11 depending on the row to which it is copied. T o calculate the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon or another planet, one merely needs to substitute the applicable value for g in cell B9. In Figure 20.2C , the force of gravity on an object at the earth ' s surface is calculated using Newton ' s Universal Law of Gravitation.

By changing the contents of C16, the mass of the object, one can determine the force (weight) of any object. Note that mass of the Earth (C16, in kg) and the radius of the earth (C17, in meters) are so large that they must be represented in scienti c format with exponential notation. 5.97E /H11001 24 is the spreadsheet format for 5.97 /H11003 10 24 kg, the mass of the Earth, and 6.38E /H11001 06 is the spreadsheet equivalent of 6.38 /H11003 10 6 m, the radius of the Earth. Figure 20.3D illustrates some basic statistics. The values in B22 - B28 represent experimental values for the volume of 1 mole of gas at stand-ard temperature and pressure, measured in liters. The values in D22 to D26 represent the sum, max- imum, minimum, average, and standard deviation of these volumes. In each case, the statistical func-tion is applied over the range of experimental val- ues (B22:B28). Changing values in cells B22 to B28 may result in a change in the average molar vol-ume, as well as the associated statistics. Such statis-tics are frequently used in laboratory experiments. The formula in Figure 20.2E determines if a projectile going a given speed (the values listed in B32, B33, B34, or B35) will reach escape veloc-ity and leave the Earth ' s gravitational eld. Escape velocity is 40,200 km/h. The formulas embedded in cells C32 to logic statements /H11005IF( /H11001 B32 > /H11005 40200, \" yes, \" \" no \" ). If the contents of cell B32 (the velocity of the rst craft) is greater than or equal to 40,200 km/h, then it will escape the earth ' s gravitational eld and the formula returns the conclusion, \" yes, it will escape. \" If, however, the velocity is less than 40,200 km/h, then the formula returns the conclusion, \" no, it will not escape. \" The spreadsheets for this activity are available online at sciencesourcebook.com . ACTIVITY 20.1.1 Using Formulas Examine the formulas shown in the boxes on the left of Figure 20.3 , and determine the spreadsheet representation of the formulas embedded in the shaded cells. Remember that the keys for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponent, and scienti c notation are /H11001 , /H11002 , * , /, ^, and E, respectively. ACTIVITY 20.1.2 Performing Calculations Figure 20.4 compares the speed of a variety of things expressed in miles per hour. Download the spreadsheet from sciencesourcebook.com , and con- vert the rst entry (D3) to the metric equivalent (kilometers/hour) using the formula 5C3 * 1.61 (there are 1.61 km per mile); then copy this for- mula (in a relative manner) down the column. The new contents of D4 should read 5C4 * 1.61. In most spreadsheet programs, a formula can be cop-ied by dragging the cell handle (Figure 20.1A ) in the lower right corner of the source cell over the destination cells. Compare the speed of the fastest human rela- tive to each item in the list by dividing the speed of the human (35.4 km/h) by the speed of the object. For example, the formula in E3 should read 35.4/D3. Copy this formula in a relative manner throughout the column. 1. How many times faster is the fastest human than the average snail? 2. What fraction of the speed of sound can the fastest person run? ACTIVITY 20.1.3 Making a Conversion Tool Virtually all scientists use the metric system when performing measurements and calculations. Unfortunately, many Americans cannot relate to meters and liters because they have grown up using customary units such as feet and quarts. In this activity, you will make a conversion spreadsheet that will convert metric units to cus-tomary units. Construct a spreadsheet in which you can enter a volume in liters and receive a vol-ume measured in gallons, pecks, pints (liquid), and quarts (liquid). Refer to Table 20.2 for conver-sion factors. Construct a second conversion chart in which you enter a distance in meters and receive measurements in feet, miles, and yards. c20.indd 396 c20.indd 396 5/9/08 11:28:31 AM 5/9/08 11:28:31 and Scientif ic Data Analysis 397 ACTIVITY 20.1.4 Computer Modeling of Greenhouse Gas Emissions One of the most powerful uses of a \" number - cruncher \" (spreadsheet) is to answer the ques-tion \" What if . . . ? \" The spreadsheet allows the user to produce models and predict outcomes.

T eam members must memorize many such diagrams so they can quickly assemble the correct formation when the quarterback calls for a play. In a similar manner, choreographers develop diagrams to show danc-ers how to move, and marching band directors develop maps to show how half - time shows will be performed. Although football players, dancers, or drum majors may comprehend such diagrams, they do not fully understand them until they have put them into action. In a similar manner, it is dif cult to fully understand a scienti c graph until you have done the activity it represents. In this section, students will learn motion graphs by doing the motions they represent. ACTIVITY 20.2.1 Walking Through Motion Graphs The instructor will select graphs for you to dem-onstrate by walking (Figure 20.7 ). Examine the graph carefully, noting the axes and de ning timedistance IJ K L MNO P Figure 20.7 Demonstrate the Movements Represented by These Graphs by Walking c20.indd 399 c20.indd 399 5/9/08 11:28:33 AM 5/9/08 11:28:33 AM400 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science your zero point before beginning. Classmates should evaluate your movement to see if it cor-rectly refl ects the graph. If available, use a motion detector and associated probeware to compare your movement with the graph (see Chapter T w e n t y - T w o ) . 20.3 Graphing Stories In 1958 C. David Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography started recording the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. 1 His work was later adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which continuously plots carbon diox-ide data year - around. The graph of these data (Figure 20.8 ) tells one of the most important stories in science. The spreadsheet of these data is available online (see sciencesourcebook.com , or search \" Mauna Loa carbon dioxide graph \" ). Hawaii is in the middle of the Paci c Ocean, far from other population centers. It is therefore a good location for monitoring global atmospheric change. Note that there are predictable seasonal variations (the small teeth on the graph) and a def-inite trend of increasing carbon dioxide concen-tration. In the 40 years between 1966 and 2006, the average yearly atmospheric carbon dioxide con-centration increased from approximately 320 ppm to 380 ppm, an increase of nearly 20 percent! Carbon dioxide is known to capture infrared radi-ation and retain heat. The picture in Figure 20.8 tells an interesting and worrisome story. Since carbon dioxide traps infrared radiation, if car-bon dioxide concentration continues to increase, then global temperatures can be expected to rise. The rapid increase in carbon dioxide and the resulting rapid change in climate may cause great problems for agriculture and natural ecosystems. Figure 20.8 tells the story of the main cause of glo-bal warming: the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations that results from the burn-ing of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and petroleum) and the removal of vegetation that consumes carbon dioxide (deforestation, deserti cation). Graph reading and interpretation are an important aspect of literacy. Y ou cannot under-stand the nancial, weather, or sports sections of the newspaper without being able to interpret sta-tistics and graphs, much less scienti c and envi- ronmental stories like that told by Figure 20.8 . In Activity 20.3.1, you will learn how to recognize stories in graphs and create stories from graphs. ACTIVITY 20.3.1 Matching Stories with Graphs Examine the four graphs in each set that refers to the following questions in Figure 20.9 . Identify the graph that best represents each of the following stories: 1. A commuter bus stops at a series of major intersections. 2. A swinging pendulum experiences substantial friction . 3. A driver cautiously accelerates from a stop sign and enters a freeway. 4. A rocket engine res continuously on a space- craft in orbit around the Earth. ACTIVITY 20.3.2 Creating Stories from Graphs Figures 20.10A to 20.10D are distance versus time graphs for runners in a marathon. Write a plausi-ble story for each runner that can explain the cor- responding graph.

The data to be graphed should be entered in corresponding rows or columns, as illustrated in Figure 20.11A . Select the data to be plotted, and then use the graphing or charting tool to create the appropriate graph. Label the axes on your chart. Note: The instructions in this sec- tion are general because the mechanics vary from program to program. Refer to the spreadsheet help menu for details not mentioned in this sec-tion. (Associated spreadsheet les and links may be found at sciencesourcebook.com .) Initially you may nd it easiest simply to change the values in the existing spreadsheets and observe changes in the associated graphs. ACTIVITY 20.4.1: Displaying Data as a Scatter ( x - y ) Plot Perhaps the most common format for plotting experimental data is the scatter plot (x - y plot ) that can show a relationship between two variables (Figure 20.11B ). The independent variable is placed on the x - axis and the dependent variable on the y - axis. The independent variable must represent a continuum, such as temperature, time, or light intensity, rather than discrete points or factors such as blood type, habitat, or wing design. For example, there is a continuum between any two times (e.g., one can divide the time between 5.0 and 5.2 sec-onds ad in nitum), but not between blood types (you have A, B, AB, or O, but nothing in between). Figure 20.11B is a scatter (x - y) plot of atmospheric ozone concentration in the Los Angeles basin as a function of time for a smoggy day in September 2006. Although the measurements were made at 1 hr intervals, they could have been made at any time in between because time is a continuous vari-able. When the data points are plotted, the rela-tionship between time and ozone concentration is clear. The atmospheric ozone concentration var-ies throughout the day, regardless of location. It is highest in the early afternoon and lowest at night. 1 . Air pollution trends: Figure 20.11B demon- strates changes in ozone concentration in a 24 hr period in the mountains and valleys of Los Angeles for a given day in September. Compare these data with those from the same day at the beach by plotting the data from the \" beach \" column.

Where is ozone pollution the worst? 2 . Air pollution trends in your region. Access the Environmental Protection Agency Web site ( epa.gov ) or your local air quality manage-ment district Web site, and obtain the values for ozone or other air pollutants for a given day in the closest large city. Record the time in one column and the pollution concentra-tion in the adjacent column. It is not neces-sary to have data at even time intervals since time is a continuous variable. Plot data such that time is on the x - axis (independent vari- able) and pollution concentration is on the y - axis. Adjust the y - axis scale so daily varia- tions can be clearly seen. Plot data for three days on three separate plots, and summarize the trends. 3 . Body size and brain size: Scienti c research- ers are always searching for correlations between variables in an attempt to better understand the world around us. Such stud-ies have led to many important discoveries, such as the link between smoking and lung cancer and the link between alcohol consump-tion and fetal alcohol syndrome. Figure 20.12A reports data for average body weight and brain size for a variety of animals. Plot these data such that body weight is on the x - axis and brain weight is on the y - axis. Does there appear to be a relationship between body weight and brain size? Add a linear trend line (best - t line) to the chart. Are humans above or below the trend line? Explain your answer. 4 . Classifying stars: Astronomers classify stars according to their temperature and absolute brightness. A plot of absolute brightness ver-sus temperature is known as a Hertzprung - Russell diagram and is used to identify stars as main sequence stars, white dwarfs, giants, and super giants. Figure 20.12B shows the temperature and absolute brightness meas-ures for stars easily seen from earth.

Sunspots: A sunspot is a relatively cool region of the photosphere (Sun ' s surface) that is character-ized by intense magnetic activity. Figure 20.12C records some the major sunspots by year from 1970 to 1999. Plot the number of sunspots as a function of time on an x - y (scatter plot). Describe the pattern you see. ACTIVITY 20.4.2 Displaying Data with Line Graphs A line graph is similar to an x - y plot, except that the independent variable is discrete and evenly spaced. For example, Figure 20.13 shows the relationship of atomic radius to atomic number. The atomic radius is one of the most important properties of an atom and infl uences a number of other proper- ties, such as boiling point, melting point, and reac-tivity. Atomic radius is a continuous variable, but atomic number is a discrete, evenly spaced variable. Atomic number represents the quantity of protons in the nucleus of an atom and therefore can be rep-resented only by whole numbers. There can be two or three protons in a nucleus but not 2.2 or 2.356. Chemistry 1 . Is boiling point a periodic property? The periodic table of the elements derives its name from the fact that many properties are periodic, or repeating. Members of a family (column) share similar characteristics, so when a property is plotted as a function of atomic number, the repeating patterns are noticeable. Notice that atomic radius is periodic (Figure 20.13B ), with Brightest Stars Star 5840 4.3 Sun 5840 4.8 Sunspots per year year # year # 1964 10 1980 155 1965 15 1981 1401966 47 1982 116 1967 94 1983 67 1968 106 1984 461969 106 1985 181970 105 1986 13 1971 67 1987 29 1972 69 1988 1001973 38 1989 1581974 35 1990 1431975 16 1991 1461976 13 1992 941977 28 1993 551978 93 1994 301979 155 1995 18species body wt.

Life expectancy is de ned as the average number of years that a person can be expected to live. Figure 20.14A shows the average life expectancy for Americans born in the years speci ed. Create a line graph of life expectancy as a function of birth year, and summarize your ndings. List the factors that you believe have infl uenced the trends you see. 7 .

Create a line graph of death rate (deaths per 100,000 population) for tuberculosis, can-cer, and cardiovascular disease such as heart attacks. Explain the trends you see. 8 . Rare and endangered species: In an effort to pre- serve biodiversity, the U.S. Wildlife service lists species that are threatened or endangered with extinction. Figure 20.14B shows the number of species that have received this designation between 1980 and 2000. Figure 20.14C plots the trends for mammals, birds, and amphibians. Plot the values for reptiles, sh, and plants on a similar graph and summarize your ndings. 20.5 Column and Bar Graphs Spreadsheet programs allow users to plot data in columns. This is particularly useful when the dependent variable is neither continuous nor evenly spaced, or when the researcher wants to highlight speci c divisions of data. Column and bar graphs include the following forms: columns, stacked col- umns, Pareto, bar, and clustered bar ; each has advan- tages for displaying certain types of data. The following activities demonstrate the usefulness of column and bar graphs in science. ACTIVITY 20.5.1 Column Chart: Comparing Between Different Items A column graph allows comparisons between dif- ferent items. Cate gories are organized horizontally and values vertically. A stacked column chart allows comparison between items in a group, as well as between groups (Figure 20.15A). Figure 20.15B shows the population pro les of the United States and Afghanistan in 2000. The vertical axis repre-sents the percentage of the population in a particu-lar age bracket. Note that Afghanistan had a much younger population than the United States, with a very small older population. Such differences result from the high birthrates and low life expectancies characteristic of many developing nations. 1 .

Obtain population pro- le data of three countries of your choice from the U.S. Census Bureau Web site or other reputable source (see sciencesourcebook.com or www.census.gov ). Create column graphs, and determine if their population pro les more closely resemble those of developed or devel-oping nations. 2 . Ecology: Wolf repopulation in Yellowstone National Park: In the nineteenth century, ranchers, farmers, and hunters made a con-certed effort to eradicate wolves from the western United States. Wolves are a predatory animal that travel in packs and were seen as a nuisance for ranchers and farmers because they prey on livestock and other animals. Removing wolves upset the food web and allowed the excessive growth of elk and deer populations, which subsequently overgrazed rangelands and woodlands. In 1995 the National Park Service reintroduced wolves into Y ellowstone National Park in order to reestablish the natural bal-ance. The wolves were originally introduced in the northern range of the park but have now spread to other regions. Produce a column graph of the wolf population of the north-ern range compared to the park as a whole using the data in Figure 20.15C . Describe the growth and distribution of the wolf popula-tion between 1995 and 2003. ACTIVITY 20.5.2 Stacked Column Charts: Comparing Within and Between Groups A stacked column chart allows comparison between items in a group, as well as between groups. Figure 20.16B is a stacked column plot of the snowfall by month at Mammoth Mountain, California, one of America ' s premier ski resorts. Comparisons of snowfall in the same month in subsequent years can be made by examining a single column. Alternatively, one can compare the average snowfall from month to month by com-paring the heights of columns. 1 . Environmental science: Rechargeable batteries: Batteries have become an essential commodity in developed societies, powering a wide array of portable electronic devices. People use rechargeable batteries because they seem more environmentally friendly than disposable ones. Unfortunately, one of the most popular rechargeable varieties, the nickel - cadmium, contains a toxic heavy metal, cadmium, that has been found in aquifers, probably as a result of leaching from batteries dumped in Figure 20.15 (A) Age Pro le Data. (B) Graph of Age Pro le Data. (C) Wolf Repopulation Data Source: Smith, D., Stahler, D., & Guernsey, D. (2004). Yellowstone wolf project: Annual report, 2003. Yellowstone National Park, WY: National Park Service. c20.indd 407 5/9/08 11:28:38 AM408 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science land lls. Recognizing the need to produce more environmentally friendly rechargeable batteries, chemists developed the nickel - metal - hydride and eventually the lithium battery. Table 20.3 shows the transition in rechargeable battery sales from 1992 to 1997. Plot these data in stacked columns, so that each column shows the percentage market share of each battery type each year. ACTIVITY 20.5.3 Pareto Charts: Ranking Data Graphically A Pareto chart is a specialized form of a column chart in which the categories are arranged so that the tallest bar is on the left, descending to the shortest bar on the right. Generally the space between subsequent columns is removed. By arranging the bars in order of height, attention is given to the more important categories. Figure 20.17A illustrates the elemental composition of the human body in descending percentage from hydrogen to sulfur, clearly showing that the body is made up mostly of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon. 1 . Earth science: Seawater composition: Seawater is uniformly saline, meaning that the relative concentration of ions is similar throughout the world. Minerals and ions enter the ocean from rivers, thermal vents, volcanoes, and the leaching of rocks on the ocean fl oor. Water evaporates from the surface of the ocean, leaving behind minerals and ions that make ocean water \" salty. \" Create a Pareto chart of the main ions found in seawater using the data in Figure 20.17B . 2 . Ecology: Threatened and endangered species. In 1973, the United States passed the Endangered Species Act, regulating a wide range of activi-ties that might affect species threatened with extinction. An organism is classi ed as endan- gered if it is in immediate danger of extinction and threatened if it is likely to become endan-gered in the foreseeable future. The law pro-tects threatened and endangered species and requires the protection of habitat necessary for their survival and recovery. Using data from Figure 20.17C , create a Pareto graph showing the states with the rarest and most endangered species. Offer an explanation for the large numbers of endangered species in the top two states. ACTIVITY 20.5.4 Bar Charts: Graphing Qualitative Independent Variables A bar chart is similar to a column chart, but the axes are reversed. Bar charts are best suited for qualitative independent variables.

ACTIVITY 20.5.5 Clustered Bar Charts: Comparing Composition of Various Items A clustered bar chart allows rapid comparison of the composition of different items.

Nutritionists advise diets low in saturated fats since these fats have been shown to stimulate blood cholesterol and contribute to cardiovascular diseases. The clustered bar chart allows consumers to make a quick comparison among different oils. 1 . Physiology: Is blood type distribution the same for all ethnicities? Human blood is classi ed as A, B, AB, or O, depending on whether it con-tains the A antigen, B antigen, both the A and B antigens, or neither. Blood transfusions may be necessary to sustain life following accidents or surgery, but the wrong mixture of blood types may be fatal. For this reason, blood spe-cialists must classify all donor blood according to type. Construct a clustered bar chart from the data in Table 20.4 , and summarize any signi cant differences in the distribution of blood types between these groups. 20.6 Pie and Area Graphs Pie charts (Figure 20.20B ) illustrate the rela- tive magnitude of a category by the portion of a circle it occupies. Area graphs (Figure 20.22B ) illustrate the magnitude of change over time. Pie and area charts use the size of the plot, rather than its position, to emphasize key features. ACTIVITY 20.6.1 Pie Charts: Comparing Relative Magnitude Within a Data Series Pie charts show only one data series and are use-ful when emphasizing a signi cant element. For example, Figure 20.20B shows the leading causes of death in the United States. 1 . What are the causes of death in developing and developed countries? Figures 20.20C and 20.20D list the leading causes of death in developed and developing countries accord-ing to data collected by the World Health Organization. (Note that the classi cations differ from those reported for the United States by the U.S. Center for Disease Control in Figure 20.20A .) Construct a pie chart of the 10 leading causes of death in developing countries, and compare it with the 10 lead-ing causes of death in developed countries. Describe the differences, and offer an explana-tion for these differences. 2 . Which biomes are most productive? Figure 20.21A lists the approximate percentages of the Earth ' s surface that are covered by various biomes and the percentages of the total productivity (amount of biomass produced) accounted for by each biome. Develop pie charts showing the percentage coverage and the percentage pro-ductivity such as those shown in Figures 20.21B and 20.21C . Which biomes have the highest and lowest productivity per unit area? Why is defor-estation of the tropical rain forests a global concern? 3 .

ACTIVITY 20.6.2 Area Graphs: Illustrating the Magnitude of Change over Time Area charts emphasize the magnitude of change over time. By displaying the sum of plotted values, an area chart shows the relationship of parts to the whole. Figure 20.22A shows a table of the number of trees infected on each slope. Figure 20.22B doc-uments the spread of an infestation of bark beetles on four sides of a mountain over a period of 10 months. The graph shows that the spread has been most severe on the south and east slopes. 1 .

Create an area graph of the data in Figure 20.23B to show the growth of the commercial satellite business in the early years between 2001 and 2003. 20.7 High - Low, Combination, and Log Plots In many instances it is necessary to plot more than one type of data on the same chart. High - low (stock) graphs give scientists the ability to plot three values (high/low and average) on the same chart, while combination plots provide the capa- bility of plotting two totally different variables on the same graph by using two different y - axes. In other instances, scientists use logarithmic (log) plots either to study exponential functions or ones in which there is a large range of values. ACTIVITY 20.7.1 High - Low Graphs (Stock): Plotting Means and Ranges of Data Researchers often want to plot a range of data, rather than individual points. For this, the high - low graph is often appropriate (see Figure 20.24A). Stock market analysts are familiar with this type of graph because companies report the high, low, and closing values for stocks each day, month, or year. Scientists often report data in a similar manner. Figure 20.24B shows the average high, low, and daily temperature for New Y ork City. The top of each line represents the average monthly high, the bottom represents the average monthly low, and the dot represents the monthly average. 1 . How does a continental climate differ from a maritime climate? Denver (39 N, 105 W) and San Francisco (37 N, 122 W) are situ-ated at approximately the same latitude, but San Francisco is near the ocean, and Denver is land - locked. San Francisco is in a maritime environment, sitting on a peninsula with the Paci c Ocean on one side and San Francisco Bay on the other. Denver is in a continen-tal environment, close to the center of the continent and far from large bodies of water (Figure 20.24C ). Climatologists say that San Francisco has an equable climate, meaning that there is little daily, seasonal, or yearly var-iation in temperature. By contrast, they char-acterize Denver ' s climate as continental, with substantial changes in seasonal temperature. Create high - low graphs of the tempera-ture pro les for both of these cities. Do your graphs support the climatologists ' characteri-zation? Explain your answer. Note: Make cer- tain both graphs use the same scale. ACTIVITY 20.7.2 Combination Graphs: Graphing Two Types of Data on One Chart It is often helpful to plot two different types of data on the same graph. For example, a cli-mograph (Figure 20.24F ) is a single graph that charts both the average temperature and precipi-tation for a given locale throughout the course of the year, using separate axes for each variable. Figure 20.24D shows the average monthly tem-perature and rainfall in Chicago. As shown in Figure 20.24F , the line graph represents tempera-ture, and the bar chart represents precipitation. The horizontal axis represents the months of the year. The climograph not only shows average tem-peratures for each month, but also illustrates sea-sonal variations in temperature over the course of the year. And the climograph reveals monthly pre-cipitation and seasonal variations in precipitation. Combination graphs like the climograph must have the same independent variable ( x - axis) but can have different dependent variables ( y - axes). Note that the axis on the left is precipitation, meas-ured in millimeters of rainfall, and the axis on the right is temperature, measured in degrees Celsius. 1 . Analyzing climates with climographs. Compare the climographs for Iquitos, Peru, and Barrow, Alaska (Figure 20.25 ). The graphs look very different with respect to temperature and rainfall, indicating that these are very dif-ferent climates. The temperature graph for Iquitos is linear and fl at, indicating little or no variation in temperature during the course of the year. By contrast, the temperature Science Source: Figure 20.24 (A, B, D, E) High - Low Graphs, (C) Locations of Different Climate Areas, and (F) Combination Graphs of Climate Data c20.indd 414 c20.indd 414 5/9/08 11:28:43 AM 5/9/08 11:28:43 ic Analysis 415 Figure 20.25 Climographs of Various 5/9/08 11:28:43 AM416 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science graph for Barrow appears like a sine wave, with a maximum in June, July, and August and a minimum in December, January, and February. From this we can conclude that Barrow is in the Northern Hemisphere (a city in the Southern Hemisphere would have maximum temperatures during December, January, and February). Although the sum-mer months are much warmer than the win-ter months in Barrow, they are still very cool, indicating that this city must be located very far north. Indeed, Barrow is on the northern coast of Alaska (Figure 20.24C ). The climate in Barrow is cold and dry. It is so cold, how-ever, that water rarely evaporates from the soil, leaving the soil wet and often frozen, a char-acteristic of arctic tundra. By contrast, the cli-mate in Iquitos is warm and wet, indicating it supports a large amount of vegetation; indeed it is found in the tropical rain forests of Peru. Analyze the climographs in Figure 20.25 to answer the following questions. a. Which city has the most equable (constant) climate? Explain. b. Which city has what most people would consider the most comfortable climate? c. Chicago and New Y ork have approximately the same climographs, except that Chicago ' s winter is colder. Why might this be? d. Which of these cities is located in a hot desert? e. Which city is in the Southern Hemisphere? f. Which of these cities is located in tropical rain forest? g. Which two of these cities have a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild winters and warm, dry summers? h. Which city would experience monsoon - type rains (heavy summer rains)? i. Which city has the coldest, driest summers? j. Which of the following cities has the most annual rainfall: Chicago, New Y ork, Dallas, or Miami? k. Which of the following has more summer rainfall: Denver, Los Angeles, or Seattle? l. Which city has a climate most similar to Chicago? m. Which of the following cities would be best suited for outdoor ice skating rinks: Chicago, New Y ork, Dallas, or Miami? n. Which has more winter rainfall: Mangalore, India, or Seattle, Washington? o. Which city has two wet seasons? 2 . Biome/climograph posters: Perform an Internet image search to nd photographs of the biome in which each city listed in Figure 20.25 is located. Make posters for the bulletin board that include photos of the natural vegetation of the biome, correlated with climographs and written descriptions (Figure 20.26 ). 3 . Create a climograph for a city close to you. Collect average rainfall and temperature data for a city near you using an online almanac, NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Web site, or similar resource ( sciencesourcebook.com , worldclimate.com or www.noaa.gov , or search \" world climate \" ). Deserts are the world's dry places and cover at least 1/5th of the Earth'ssurface. Because there is so littlewater, deserts are bare landscapes.Deserts photo o f biome climograph descriptionbiome 050100150200250300350 JF M A MJ JA S O N D-30-20-100102030precipitation (mm) temperature (C )Coniferous Forests Coniferous forests are made up mainly of cone-bearing or coniferoustrees, such as spruces, hemlocks,pines and firs.

Figure 20.27A contains hypo- thetical data one might nd in the moun- tains of the western United States. Species diversity is measured as the average number of animal and plant species found within a 1 hectare (10,000 square meter) plot of land. Average biomass refers to the average mass of all of the organisms in the same plot. Generate a combination graph that plots species diversity on the left axis, and biomass on the right axis. Y our graph should look like Figure 20.27B . ACTIVITY 20.7.3 Semilogarithmic Plots: Plotting Wide Range Data Some data are dif cult to plot because of an extremely wide data range. Figure 20.28 shows such data for the distribution of earthquakes by magnitude. Note that in an average year, there are more than 100,000 earthquakes world-wide between magnitude 3 and 4, and only 2 greater than magnitude 8. If the data are plot-ted on a simple linear scale (Figure 20.28A ), the number of larger earthquakes is virtually invisible because the number of small earthquakes dwarfs it. Although massive earthquakes are much more important, they do not appear due to the scale of the graph. However, data plotted on a semiloga- rithmic graph (Figure 20.28B ) clearly show the number of earthquakes of any magnitude. The graph is referred to as a semilogarithmic (semilog) plot because the y - axis is logarithmic, while the x - axis is linear. A logarithmic scale is constructed so that the data are plotted in powers of 10 to yield a maximum range while maintaining resolution at the low end of the scale. Semilogarithmic plots are also useful when demonstrating exponential relationships. Figure 20.29 shows the growth of a colony of bacteria as a function of time, where t represents Figure 20.27 (A) Table and (B) Graph of Species Diversity and Biomass Versus Elevation Magnitude (greater than)number of earthquakes Magnitude (greater than)number of earthquakes 110100100010000100000 34 8 9 567020000400006000080000100000120000 35 79 Figure 20.28 Distribution of Earthquakes by Magnitude on (A) Linear and (B) Semilog Scales Source: U.S. Geological Survey.

The Sourcebook for Teaching Science the time interval and P t represents the size of the population at any given time, t. When the data are plotted on a standard linear scale, a curve is drawn as shown in Figure 20.29A . This is a classic expo-nential growth curve. If the data are plotted on a semilogarithmic graph (Figure 20.29B ), they plot as a straight line. Straight lines on semilog plots indicate an exponential relationship. In this case the relationship is: P t /H11005 P0ert where r is the growth rate, de ned as ln(Pn/P0) _______ t . 1 . Do radioactive elements decay in an exponen- tial manner? Data in Table 20.6 show the mass of strontium - 90, a radioactive isotope with a half - life of 28 years. Strontium - 90 is one of the isotopes that may accompany a nuclear accident. It is potentially hazardous not only because it is radioactive, but also because it mimics calcium and accumulates in bone. Graph the data in Table 20.6 , rst with a linear scale and then as a semilog graph. If the line becomes straight when plotted on a semilog graph, the relationship is exponential. Does strontium - 90 experience exponential decay? 20.8 Statistics In 1989, two researchers announced that they had achieved nuclear fusion with a simple appa-ratus at room temperature. Fusion, the proc-ess in which two atomic nuclei combine to form a larger nucleus, has been touted as the answer to the world ' s energy problems, but it has been achieved only in high - temperature, high - energy environments. The announcement of \" cold fusion \" was of interest to scientists and energy planners worldwide. But no one was ever able to replicate the researchers ' purported ndings. Although the researchers may have been earnest in their report, they did not have any independent con rmation of their work. A sample size of one is not suf cient to prove anything in science, and the researchers should not have presented their nd- ings to the media without suf cient veri cation from repeated experimentation. Scienti c research relies on independent con- rmation and statistics, the branch of mathemat- ics that deals with the analysis and interpretation of numerical data. The school science laboratory is an excellent place to employ statistics because many students and lab groups may collect data on the same experiment. Rather than relying on one data point from one group, it is better to take the mean of all groups.

Spreadsheet programs provide tools to perform many statistical tests, but we focus on those most commonly used in sci-ence: basic descriptive measures ( percentage, per capita, mean, median, mode, maximum, minimum ) and curve tting. ACTIVITY 20.8.1 Descriptive Statistics: Making Sense of the Data In 1952 a sulfur - laden smog covered London, England, leading to the deaths of approximately 4000 people. In 1963 an air pollution inversion occurred in New Y ork City, leading to 168 deaths. Shocking tragedies such as these led to the passage of the Air Quality Control Act in the United States and similar measures in other parts of the world. Since the passage of this landmark act in 1967, agencies have been commissioned to measure pol-lution and set standards. Figure 20.30 shows the number of unhealth- ful air days per year in some of the major cities in the United States in 1999. T o determine the percentage of days that are considered to have unhealthful air, divide the number of unhealthy days by 365 days per year and convert to percent-age. Once the formula has been entered in the top cell, it can be copied to the remaining cells. When you have completed this calculation, determine the average (/H11005AVERAGE( rst cell: last cell )) and median (/H11005MEDIAN( rst cell: last cell )) number of unhealthful days for the cities listed. Finally, deter-mine the city with the largest number of unhealth-ful days ( /H11005MAX( rst cell: last cell )) and the city with the least ( /H11005MIN( rst last cell ) ) . ACTIVITY 20.8.2 Trend Lines: Discovering Relationships in the Data A trend line is a best - t line through a series of data points. It can be a linear, exponential, power, logarithmic, or polynomial function. Trend lines help researchers visualize relationships. The best trend line is the one that best ts the data. 1 .

Ozone pollution is greatest in the valleys and least in the mountains. (2) Students will produce graphs similar to 20.11B and comment on fl uctuations in air quality. Ozone is an element of photochemical smog, and as such is highest at midday. (3) Students should produce a graph similar to Figure 20.33A . Brain size is somewhat proportional to body size, but humans have a disproportionately large brain relative to their body size and are above the trend line. (4) Students should produce a graph simi-lar to Figure 20.33B . The Sun is a main sequence star. (5) Sunspot frequency varies over an approximately 11 - year cycle (see Figure 20.34 ). 20.4.2 (1) Boiling point is a periodic or repeating property, as shown in Figure 20.35A . Members of the carbon fam-ily (group 6; elements 6, 14) have the highest boiling points, while the noble gases (group 8; elements 2, for Teaching Science 18) have the lowest boiling points. (2) Melting point is a periodic property (Figure 20.35B ). Members of the carbon family (group 6; elements 6, 14) have the highest melting points, and the noble gases (group 8; elements 2, 10, 18) have the lowest. (3) Atomic mass is not a periodic property. The mass increases as the atomic number increases, with no repeating (periodic) patterns (Figure 20.35C ). (4) First ionization energy is a periodic property (Figure 20.35D ). The Noble gases (group 8; elements 2, 10, 18) have the highest ioni-zation energies, and the alkali metals (group 1; ele-ments 3, 11, 19) have the lowest. (5) Electron af nity Figure 20.35 (A, B, D, E) Periodic and Properties Scientif ic Data Analysis 423 is a periodic property (Figure 20.35E ). Members of the halogens (group 7; elements 9, 17) have the high-est electron af nities. Members of the calcium fam- ily (group 2; elements 4, 12) have the lowest electron af nities. (6) Life expectancy (Figure 20.36A ) increased continuously from 1900 to 2000 due largely to better medicine, housing, and other technological factors. (7) Tuberculosis was a major killer in 1900 but was almost extinct by 2000 due to improvements in anti-biotics and public health (Figure 20.36B ). As people lived longer, they were more prone to suffer symptoms associated with aging, such as cardiovascular disease. Advances in medicine, nutrition, and surgery reduced the rate of cardiovascular disease in the second half of the twentieth century, and the population contin-ued to live even longer so that they were now more likely to develop cancer due to lengthy exposure to radiation, carcinogenic chemicals, and other environ-mental and biological factors. (8) Students will add the other three groups to the spreadsheet. 20.5.1 (1) The population pro le of Germany closely resem- bles that of the United States. Like other developed nations, Germany has a low birth rate and high life expectancy. By contrast, developing nations generally have younger pro les due to a higher birth rate and lower life expectancy. Students will graph a popula-tion pro le of Germany. (2) Students should produce a graph showing that the wolf population experienced relatively constant growth and spread to other parts of the park. 20.5.2 (1) See the stacked column of market share for rechargeable batteries, Figure 20.37A . 20.5.3 (1) Students provide a Pareto graph (similar to Figure 20.17A ) of seawater. (2) Students provide a Pareto graph showing the greatest number of threat-ened and endangered species in California and Hawaii. California is a large and geographically diverse state with a large number of species. One would expect more endangered species in California simply because it has such a large number of species. Habitat destruc-tion is the leading cause of extinction. Both California and Florida are experiencing rapid population growth. The development of farms and cities destroys natural habitats and may lead to extinction. 20.5.4 (1 - 4) Students develop bar graphs such as Figure 20.18A . The elemental composition of the human body shows more similarity to the oceans.

Types B and AB are absent in the Navajo population. Koreans have the broadest dis-tribution of blood types. Kenyans have the lowest per-centage of type A blood. 20.6.1 (1) Students will develop pie charts resembling Figure 20.20B . Communicable diseases (AIDS, tuberculosis, and measles) are much more common causes of death in developing countries, while dis-eases associated with aging (heart disease, stroke, and cancer) are more common causes of death in developed countries. Health standards are higher in developed countries, reducing communicable dis-eases and allowing people to live to the age where diseases associated with aging become a greater issue. (2) Students will develop pie charts for area cover-age and productivity (Figure 20.21B ). Tropical rain forests, while occupying 4 percent of the Earth ' s sur-face, account for 27 percent of the world ' s productiv-ity. Destruction of the world ' s tropical forests leads to a dramatic reduction in biomass production and an increase in carbon dioxide, a primary greenhouse gas that contributes to global climate change. (3) Students develop a pie chart of energy consumption by energy source. About 85 percent comes from fossil fuels, and about 8 percent from renewable sources. 20.6.2 (1) See Figure 20.38 . (2) Students generate an area graph for satellite launches. 20.7.1 (1) Students develop temperature plots for Denver and San Francisco and nd that Denver has a continental climate with great seasonal temperature variations, while San Francisco has an equable, maritime climate. 20.7.2 (1) (a) Iquitos, Peru. The average temperature in Iquitos is very constant, as illustrated by the straight temperature graph. The rainfall does vary from season to season, but is relatively heavy each month. (b) Los Angeles, California. The average temperature varies lit-tle from month to month, averaging about 18 C. Room temperature is 22 C (72 F). (c) Chicago is inland, while New Y ork is on the coast.

Note that the temperature curve is inverted from the others, with the warmest months in the period from May through September. (f) Iquitos, Peru. It has a warm (averaging 26 C) and wet (2880 mm rain annually) climate. (g) Los Angeles, California, and Perth, Australia.

There are two spikes on the precipitation graph. (2) Students will make biome posters as shown in Figure 20.26 . (3) Students will generate a climograph for their city in the format shown in Figure 20.24F . (4) Students should replicate Figure 20.27B , a combination graph that plots species diversity and biomass as a function of elevation. 20.7.3 (1) Figure 20.39A plots radioactive decay on a linear scale and Figure 20.39B on a logarithmic scale (semi-log plot). Strontium - 90 experiences exponential decay, as indicated by the straight line when plotted on a log-arithmic scale. 20.8.1 (1) The following statistics are for the cities listed. Average unhealthful days/year: 34 (9 percent). Median number of unhealthful days/year: 29 (8 percent). Maximum number of unhealthful days/year: 93 (25 percent) in Riverside, California. Minimum number of unhealth-ful days/year: 5 (1 percent) Boston, Massachusetts. 20.8.2 (1) Figure 20.40A is a plot of distance versus time for an accelerating automobile. The best - t line is a squared function (power), y /H11005 4.8 x 2 . (2) The rela- tionship of period to length in a pendulum is shown in Figure 20.40B . The best - t line is a square root function (power) with an equation y /H11005 2 x .5 . The full equation for the period of a pendulum is T /H11005 2 /H9266 (L/g ) 0.5 , where L is the length of the pendulum, and g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s 2 ) Mapping and Visualizing Scienti c Data For the Teacher 426 21.1 Map Construction 427 21.2 Topographic Maps 428 21.3 Mapping Data Electronically 434 21.4 Weather Maps 438 21.5 Environmental Maps 444 21.6 Astronomy Maps 446 21.7 Interpreting Aerial and Satellite Photographs 452 Answers to Chapter Activities 454 For the Teacher Mapmaking is one of the oldest and most basic forms of written communication and is essen-tial to modern science. Scientists map everything from the structure of the atom to the structure of the universe. The Human Genome Project has sequenced the human genome, and researchers are mapping the 100,000 or more genes on chro-mosomes (Figure 21.1 ). 1 At the other end of the spectrum, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is creating a three - dimensional map of about a million galax-ies and quasars. 2 As our knowledge continues to grow, so has the need to represent it in graphic form. Map development and map reading are basic skills that all students should acquire. Geological, hydrologi- cal, topographic, botanical, distribution, gene, soil, astronomical, climatic, and weather maps are but a few of the many types of maps that are essential to science. In this chapter, students are provided with opportunities to design and interpret maps from a wide variety of scienti c disciplines. Many of the activities require Internet resources that can be accessed from sciencesource book.com or by an Internet search. Some resources allow students to collect and map data in conjunc-tion with other students and researchers. In such cases, the data are managed on a Web site so all participants can analyze them. For example, stu-dents participating in the Journey North project contribute information on the sightings of orioles c21.indd 426 c21.indd 426 5/9/08 6:08:22 PM 5/9/08 6:08:22 PMMapping and Visualizing Scienti c Data 427 teams, and as a result, they were able to combine their talents and efforts to solve many real - world problems. If you walk into modern research laboratories you will likely nd blackboards, whiteboards, com- puter screens, and paper, lled with diagrams and pictures representing the topics being researched. Researchers use these media to communicate dif- cult concepts to one another. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a good diagram or map is worth ten thousand! Diagrams and maps represent relationships and allow researchers to communicate more easily with one another. The following map-making activities in this chapter are designed to help students follow and deliver clear instructions. ACTIVITY 21.1.1 Creating a Map from Written Directions Create a map from the following written direc-tions. Use a ne - tip pencil and the appropriate symbols from Figure 21.3 . 1. Draw a school symbol in the center of a blank sheet of paper to represent \" Granite High School \" and a compass in the upper right corner. 2. Exit through the south gate of Granite High School. 3. Turn west on the primary highway on which the school is located, and travel 1 km to the county border. 4. Continue traveling west 2 km until you see a church on your right. 5. Travel northwest for 2 km on the light - duty road that intersects the highway just west of the church. 6. At 2 km you cross railroad tracks that are perpendicular to the road. 7. Turn northeast on the dirt road that parallels the train tracks. on their migration north with the onset of spring. 3 Figure 21.2 is an example of a map generated using such data and shows not only the migration of the orioles but also the advance of spring north toward Canada. Other projects engage students in an array of data collection activities, such as weather data, cosmic ray detection, and magnetic eld intensity. The activities in this chapter are designed to help students master scienti c mapping and interpreta- tion skills. 21.1 Map Construction Thomas Edison received 1093 U.S. patents for his inventions, including the electric light bulb, motion picture, and phonograph. 4 Although he is remem- bered for these inventions, his greatest contribution to science and technology was the development of the independent research laboratory. Edison had extensive laboratories in New Jersey and hired the best chemists, physicists, machinists, and inventors he could nd. Edison was successful in the labora- tory because he worked collaboratively with oth-ers who shared his vision. Edison was excellent at communicating his ideas to those on his research Tel Tel Long arm Cen Short arm HLA region Figure 21.1 Sample Gene Map: Position of Human Leukocyte Antigen on Chromosome 6 Before April 1 By April 15 By May 1 After May 15First sightings of oriolesDate of first sightings Figure 21.2 Map of the First Spring Sightings of Orioles c21.indd 427 c21.indd 427 5/9/08 6:08:23 PM 5/9/08 6:08:23 PM428 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science 8. Travel 2 km northeast on the dirt road until you cross a stream. 9. Get out of the car, and follow the meandering stream in a westward direction for approxi-mately 3 km until it enters a forest. 10. Look for the entrance to a mine on the north side of the creek immediately after entering the forest. This is your destination. ACTIVITY 21.1.2 Creating a Map from Spoken Directions Create a map from the following spoken instruc-tions. Y our instructor will read these aloud. Use a ne - tip pencil and the appropriate symbols from Figure 21.3 . 1. Draw a school symbol in the center of a blank sheet of paper to represent \" Sequoia High School \" and a compass in the upper right corner. 2. Exit through the south gate of Sequoia High School. 3. Travel due east for 0.5 km on the secondary highway on which the school is located. 4. Turn due south on the trail that is on the east border of the orchard. 5. After 0.5 km, the orchard ends, and you cross under power lines. 6. Continue south for another 0.5 km until you come to a dirt road. 7. Travel east on the dirt road for 1.0 km, at which point you will reach a marsh. 8. The road turns southeast. Follow it for 1.0 km, at which point you will reach a stream that crosses under the road and fl ows into the marsh. 9. Follow the stream west for approximately 3 km until you reach a lake. 10. Walk around the south shore of the lake for 1 km to the other side, where you reach a clus-ter of cabins. 11. In the middle of the cabins, you will nd a trail. Travel south 1 km, passing through the woods. 12. When the trail emerges from the woods, it turns east. 13. Hike east on the trail for 1.5 km until you reach the gravel pit on the north side of the trail. 14. Just past the gravel pit, the trail splits. Follow the branch that leads southeast 0.5 km to the cabin. This is your destination. ACTIVITY 21.1.3 Writing Clear Directions Write clear, explicit directions for how to get from your school to your home or from the entrance of your school to your science classroom. Present your instructions to a lab partner, who can draw an accurate map based on your instructions. The better your instructions are, the more accu-rate your partner will be able to draw. Compare the map to your home with driving directions retrieved from an Internet mapping program, such as those found at sciencesourcebook.com or maps. google.com , or search street \" maps. \" 21.2 Topographic Maps T opographic maps are two - dimensional repre- sentations of the three - dimensional surface of the Earth.

ACTIVITY 21.2.1 Reading a Topographic Map Hikers frequently \" contour \" around a mountain or hill when hiking cross - country (with out a trail). They choose to contour so they don ' t have to gain or lose elevation. If you could plot their path on a 12 3 45 C2 26 810 4 5 71 119 455 C7674 BA DE 7 7 Figure 21.4 Contour Map with a Contour Interval of 40 Feet Elevation Source: U.S. Geological Survey. (2003). Public domain USGS topographic maps, printed from National Geographic TOPO! PM430 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science map, it would represent a contour line like those shown in Figure 21.4 . The distance between con-tour lines is consistent on an individual map but may vary from map to map. On Figure 21.4 , the elevation between contour lines is 40 feet, and therefore the distance between two dark lines is 200 feet (there are ve divisions between dark lines). The closer the lines are together, the steeper the slope (A), and the farther the lines are apart, the less steep the slope (B). Extremely close lines indicate cliffs. Examine Figure 21.4 , and note the locations of peaks (C). The contours around the peaks are in concentric rings, indicating that you can traverse completely around a peak without changing eleva-tion. The innermost ring indicates the summit. If the inner ring is very small, the peak is pointed, but if it is large, the peak is fl at. Contour lines form U or V shapes when representing ridges (D) or canyons (E). If surrounded by lower elevation contours, the feature is a ridge, and if surrounded by higher elevation contours, the feature is can-yon. Match each of the numbered features on the map in Figure 21.4 with one of the following landforms: canyoncliffplateausteep slopegentle slope fl at region (basin) pointed summitpass ridgevalley ACTIVITY 21.2.3 Drawing a Contour Map In this activity, you will construct a three - dimen-sional model of a mountain and draw a two - dimensional contour (topographic) map to represent its shape. The model can be made of clay, modeling clay, papier - m \u00e2 ch \u00e9 , salt dough, or other similar material. Y our \" mountain \" should be attached to a piece of cardboard and should t inside a shoebox or similar container. Obtain a set of books or boards that have the same thickness. Set the rst book or board close to the \" mountain. \" Place a pen fl at on this surface, keep it at right angles to the mountain, and draw a ring around the mountain. Place a second book or board on top of the rst, and draw another line. Repeat until you have reached the top. Each ring represents an elevation difference equal to the thickness of the books or boards. Place the \" mountain \" in a shoebox or similar container, and stretch and tape clear plastic food wrap over the opening (Figure 21.5 A). Look straight down on the model mountain. Using an overhead pen or similar marker, draw lines on the plastic wrap to match the lines you drew on the mountain. When you have traced all of the lines you will have a two - dimensional topographic map of your arti- cial landform. Figure 21.5 B illustrates how the contour map correlates with the lines drawn on the \" mountain. \" ACTIVITY 21.2.3 Identifying Ecological and Geological Transects Figure 21.6 is a topographic map of hilly terrain in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. The ve lines on the map repre- sent transects: equal - length lines along which biologists, geologists, or ecologists collect envi-ronmental and biological data when studying a region. The ve transects in Figure 21.6 are each 1 mi in length. Scientists make records of what they observe at even intervals along the transect. After collecting such data, they construct an eleva-tion pro le so they can correlate plant and animal distribution with slope, exposure, and elevation. Figure 21.7 shows ve pro les. For each of the transects, nd the matching pro le. Assume you are walking from left to right across the map. The mountainpen lines contour mapcontour lines Figure 21.5 (A) Drawing a Contour Map.

The farther apart the lines are, the fl atter the terrain is. ACTIVITY 21.2.4 Interpreting Elevation Pro les The Boston Marathon is the world ' s oldest annual marathon and one of the most prestigious foot races in the world. Runners study the course in detail so they can plan their running strategy. Of particu- lar interest is the elevation pro le (Figure 21.8 ), a graph that plots elevation as a function of dis-tance. Runners note that although there is a net loss in elevation as they run from rural Hopkinton to the center of Boston, they encounter a number of uphill sections, particularly between miles 16 and 21, when they climb the infamous Heartbreak Hill. Elevation pro les are made by plotting elevation (m) profile 2 Figure 21.9 Topographic Map with Routes and Matching Elevation Pro les Source: U.S. Geological Survey. (2003). Public domain USGS topographic maps, printed from National Geographic TOPO! software. (determined by the closest contour line) as a func- tion of linear distance along the path. In this activity you will nd ve maps of varied terrain in California ' s Sierra Nevada Mountains (Figures 21.9 to 21.12 ). On each map there are two alternative routes from point 1 to point 2. One is a trail, marked with a dashed line, and the other a cross - country route, marked with a solid line. Exam-ine the map, and match the routes with the pro les. For each pair of routes, specify which option follows an easier (less elevation change) course. ACTIVITY 21.2.5 Constructing Pro les from Topographic Maps In 1871, the preservationist John Muir published his rst work, \" Y osemite Glaciers, \" in the New York Tribune. In this infl uential article, Muir hypothesized that the great valleys of Y osemite were carved by 1 2C D2250 4 Figure 21.10 Topographic Map with Routes and Matching Elevation Pro les Source: U.S. Geological Survey.

Since the introduction of this idea, geologists and glaciologists have been fascinated with the work of glaciers in Y osemite and elsewhere in the world. Glaciologists still study the features in Y osemite in an effort to gain a better understand ing of the work of ancient glaciers. Figure 21.13 shows four transects in an area north of Y osemite Valley. Using the contour map provided, draw a simple pro le illustrating how elevation changes as a function of distance from the rst letter to the second. The x - axis should be distance, and the y - axis elevation. Which of the transects most closely resembles a glacial, U - shaped valley? 433 Region North of Yosemite Valley Source: U.S. Geological Survey. (2003).

They may fl y 3500 km from Canada to Mexico, where they spend the winter. At the end of March, they migrate north-ward to the U.S. Gulf states, where they lay their eggs and die. The next generation continues the migra-tion back toward Canada, where the cycle begins again. Monarchs return to the oyamel ( r) forests in the mountains of Mexico where they spend the winter. Unfortunately, these forests are threatened from overlogging, and ecologists are con cerned that if these habitats are destroyed, the annual monarch butterfl y migration could stop. Environmentalists are working to save the oyamel forests and pro-tect the monarch butterfl y and other species that depend on it. Each year thousands of school children and others record the date that monarch butterfl ies appear in their neighborhoods and submit this information to a central database. Research ers enter the longitude and latitude of these sightings into geographic information system (GIS) software and plot them on a map to show migration patterns (Figure 21.14 ). Such information was used to show the vital role of the Mexican r forests to the survival of the monarch. Although GIS software is the best way to map geographic data, such data can also be graphed manually or with spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel. Longitude and lati tude are plotted on an XY scatter plot, with tude serving 6:08:30 PMMapping and Visualizing Scienti c Data 435 the X (horizontal) coordinate and latitude as the Y (vertical) coordinate. Such data are acquired using a handheld global positioning system (GPS) device or by locating the site on a topographic map. A scanned map should be placed in the back- ground of the XY scatter plot and the scales adjusted so the minimum and maximum X and Y values correspond to the longitude and latitude limits of the map. In the activities that follow, you will plot these data using Excel, GIS, or other plot-ting software. If this software is not available to you, the data can be plotted manually on a map. U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps of all por-tions of the United States are freely available on the Internet. (See sciencesourcebook.com or topozone. com , or search for \" USGS topo graphic maps. \" ) ACTIVITY 21.3. Mapping Animal Populations In 1804, Meriwether Lewis, of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, made the rst scienti c observations of \" barking squirrels, \" an animal now known as the prairie dog. As the plains were settled and cultivated, the habitat of the prairie dog shrank, and now some species are listed as threatened or endangered. For a species to obtain threatened or endan- gered status and the special protection it ensures, data must be collected on its historic and current ranges. This is best done by maintaining historic data in a database and plotting the information with GIS or spreadsheet software. Figure 12.15 A includes the GPS coordinates (longitude followed by latitude) of Colorado ' s tallest peaks, as well as the coordinates of populations of the white - tailed prai-rie dog, the black - tailed prairie dog, and another rodent, the marmot. Plot the peaks and populations on Figure 12.15 B or on the spreadsheet available on sciencesourcebook.com . 1. Describe the distribution of both the black - and white - tailed prairie dogs in Colorado. Do they have distinct or overlapping ranges? 2. How does the distribution of the marmot com- pare with the distribution of the prairie dogs. ACTIVITY 21.3.2 Mapping Patterns of Earthquake Activity Earthquakes can cause tremendous loss of human life as buildings collapse and tsunamis fl ood beachside towns. It is estimated that 830,000 peo-ple died in the Shasi earthquake in China in 1556, and more recently 255,000 people lost their lives in the Tangshan, China, earthquake of 1976. In 2004, an earthquake in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, caused a tsunami that spread destruction throughout the coastal regions of southern Asia, claiming more than 200,000 lives. Although seismologists (scientists who study earthquakes) are unable to accurately predict the time and location of earthquakes, they have been able to state the likelihood of earthquakes by examining historical records. These data are provided to insurance companies so they can set earthquake insurance rates and to city planners so they can set building codes that address the threat. Figure 21.16 A records the location of large (magnitude 7.3 or greater) earthquakes in the United States during the past 200 years. If these data are plotted, one can determine the location of greatest earthquake hazard. Using the spread-sheet downloaded from sciencesourcebook.com , develop an XY scatter plot of the data, using longi-tude as the x - value and latitude as the y - value. The spreadsheet already has a map in the background to facilitate plotting.

Some cities require that new housing construc- tion include shear walls (the attachment of plywood sheets to building frames) to prevent excessive damage in earthquakes. Examine your plot, and predict which of the following cities would likely have such a code: San Francisco, Miami, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Anchorage, Baltimore, Dallas, and Denver. Explain your answer. ACTIVITY 21.3.3 Mapping Shark Populations Hawaii is one of the most popular tourist desti-nations in the world, yet many visitors are fear-ful of swimming in the ocean because Hawaii is home to 40 species of sharks. Most species of sharks nevertheless are harmless, and shark - related injuries are relatively rare. Figure 21.17 A shows hypothetical sightings of three of the most common sharks in Hawaiian waters as recorded by a group of researchers. Using the spreadsheet f r o m sciencesourebook.com or GIS software (search \" GIS \" ), develop an XY scatter plot of the data for sightings of hammerhead and pygmy sharks, using longitude as the x - value and latitude as the y - value. Alternatively, plot the data manually on the map provided (Figure 21.17 B). 1. Describe the distribution of whitetip reef sharks found in this study. 2. Are pygmy sharks more likely to be seen in the open ocean or in reefs surrounding the islands? How about hammerhead sharks? ACTIVITY 21.3.4 Mapping Your Movement with a GPS Device For centuries, people have tried to develop a depend-able way to determine their location with respect to camps, cities, and other destinations. Ancient sailors followed coastlines and later traveled in open seas, studying the stars to determine locations and direc- tions. T echniques improved signi cantly with the development of the compass, sextant, and chronom-eter, but the most signi cant improvements took place with the advent of satellite technology. T oday ' s global positioning system (GPS) was developed by the U.S. military and is used to deter-mine the precise latitude, longitude, and elevation of any object on the Earth ' s surface equipped with a GPS device. The GPS device receives radio mes-sages from different satellites, determines the dis-tance to each by studying the time delay of the signal, and triangulates the position by noting the rel ative distances to each of the satellites. Using a handheld GPS device provided by your teacher, record the GPS coordinates for three locations such as your classroom, home, local park, or other notable place. 1. Enter the coordinates provided by your GPS device into an online mapping site (available at sciencesourcebook.com , topographic map, street map, and aer-ial photograph of each location. In most cases, street and topographic mapping sites allow latitude and longitude input. On each map or photograph, circle the location at which you recorded the coordinates. Note that most map-ping programs accept the latitude before the longitude. 2. Describe how GPS devices can be used in geology, ecology, marine biology, oceanogra-phy, seismology, or other science. 21.4 Weather Maps ACTIVITY 21.4.1 Interpreting Weather Maps Meteorologists report their ndings and predic- tions on weather maps using international sym-bols such as those shown in Figure 21.18 . A circle is placed at the location of the weather station. An empty circle indicates clear skies, and a lled circle indicates complete cloud cover. A quarter - lled circle indicates 25 percent cloud cover, a c21.indd 438 c21.indd 438 5/9/08 6:08:32 PM 5/9/08 6:08:32 Visualizing Scienti c Data 439 half - lled circle indicates 50 percent cloud cover, and a three - quarters - lled circle indicates 75 per- cent cloud coverage. A number next to the circle indicates the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. If the winds are calm, no lines are attached to the circle. Precipitation is indicated by a symbol to the left of the circle. A dot ( .) indicates rain, an asterisk (*) snow, bars ( fog, a comma (,) drizzle, and a bolt, thunderstorms. T o indicate the presence of a wind, a line ( \" barb \" ) is attached to the circle from the direction of the wind. For example, a northern wind would be shown by a line at the top of the circle, and an eastern wind would be indicated by a line on the right side. The strength of the wind is indicated by fl ags or bars emanating from this line. A long fl ag is added for each 10 knots (1 knot /H11005 1.15 mph or 1.85 km/hr) of wind speed, and a short fl ag is added for an additional 5 knots. Thus, two long fl ags and one short fl ag indicate a wind speed of 25 knots. Thus, the weather symbol shown in the key of Figure 21.18 indicates that it is raining at the weather station, and the temperature is 45 F, with 50 percent cloud cover and a wind of 25 knots Reef Whitetip Pygmy Shark Hammerhead Longitude Latitude Longitude Latitude Longitude -15421.6 22.1 21.7 21.5 21.8 19.7 19.922.3 21.2 20.4 Shark Sightings latitude (West)longitude (North) Reef WhitetipPygmy Shark HammerheadB A Figure 21.17 (A) Data of Shark Sightings and (B) Map of Hawaiian Islands Region c21.indd 439 c21.indd 439 5/9/08 6:08:32 PM 5/9/08 6:08:32 PM440 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science from the north. Some weather maps record pres- sure, dew point, and precipitation next to the sym-bol. Often only the last three digits of pressure are recorded, so 014 /H11005 1014 millibars, and 995 /H11005 995 millibars. The dew point is the temperature at which dew or condensation forms and is recorded in degrees Fahrenheit. This weather map includes isobars, lines of equal pressure. Y ou may note that the 1004 millibar line is adjacent to Seattle, Washington, indicating that the current air pres-sure in Seattle is approximately 1004 millibars. 1. Referring to Figure 21.18 , record the conditions in Dallas, Rapid City, and Atlanta in Table 21.1 . 2. Identify the city that is experiencing the fol- lowing conditions: (a) 10 knot winds from the northeast; (b) the onset of a cold front; (c) onshore breeze of 10 knots; (d) offshore wind of 15 knots; (e) partially cloudy skies and a northeast wind of 35 knots; (f) close to the center of a high - pressure zone; (g) in the center of a low - pressure zone; (h) fog. ACTIVITY 21.4.2 Predicting Weather Mete orology is the science of the Earth ' s atmos-phere, particularly its patterns of climate and weather. Meteorologists study weather patterns so they can predict future patterns and trends. Predictions are important not only for individuals who are planning picnics and outings, but for farm-ers, water district managers, re ghters, and others who need to make informed decisions based on the likelihood of future weather. Using an Internet weather service (look on sciencesourcebook.com or www.nws.noaa.gov , or search \" weather maps \" ), print satellite photographs (visible and radar) and weather maps (including pressure, fronts, tempera-ture, rain) of North America for the past four days. Locate zones of high - (H) and low - pressure (L). On a blank map (Figure 21.19 ) indicate the centers for all four days, using H 1 to indicate the center of a high - pressure zone on day 1, H 2 the high - pressure center on day 2, and so on.

Log on to the same Web site tomor-row and check your predictions. Repeat this for cold fronts (lines with triangles) and warm fronts (lines with half circles). 1. Do high - and low - pressure systems appear randomly arranged from day to day, or do they appear to fl ow in lines across the map? Explain your answer. 2. How did your predictions of high - and low - pressure zones compare with what occurred? 3. How did your predictions of the positions of the weather fronts compare with what occurred? 4. In the Northern Hemisphere, winds fl ow counterclockwise around low - pressure cen-ters, creating cyclones. Using wind barbs, pre-dict the direction of air movement around the centers of low pressure on your map. 5. Low - pressure zones are often associated with cloud formation and rain. Indicate the loca-tions on your map most likely to be covered by clouds; then compare this with satellite photos (showing clouds) and radar maps (showing rain). Summarize your ndings. ACTIVITY 21.4.3 Tracking Hurricanes A tropical cyclone is a large circular storm with wind speeds in excess of 73 mph (117 km/hour). Such storms are known as typhoons in the Paci c, cyclones in the Indian Ocean, and hurricanes in the Atlantic. They start over open oceans in tropi-cal regions and move heat energy away from the equators toward the poles. Hurricanes cause sig-ni cant damage if they make landfall in popu- lated regions, as happened when a hurricane hit Galveston, T exas, in 1900. Winds of 120 mph generated a 20 ft storm surge that swept over the entire island, destroying 3500 homes and killing as many as 8000 people, making it the worst disaster in American history. In August 1992, a stronger hurricane, Andrew, hit Florida with sustained winds of 145 mph and gusts in excess of 175 mph! More than 60,000 homes were destroyed, yet only 53 lives were lost. Although Andrew was stronger, satellite data allowed meteorologists to plot the progress of the storm and warn residents of the impending danger. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin- istration (NOAA) maintains the National 6:08:35 PM442 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science committed to plotting the movement of hurri- canes and warning people of approaching storms. Storms, however, can change course, and meteor-ologists must note these changes and update their predictions. In this activity, you will assume the role of a forecaster, issuing warnings to residents based on GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude). Table 21.2 shows the GPS coordinates for one of the most destructive hurricanes in American history. Plot these data on the hurricane - tracking map pro-vided by NOAA and the National Weather Service (Figure 21.20 ). After every three measurements, predict which state the hurricane will hit. After it has made landfall, continue to plot its course.

Explain your answer. 21.5 Environmental Maps When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established in 1970, it was commis-sioned by Congress to protect America ' s air, water, and land resources. The EPA and other organi-zations develop careful maps so they can accu-rately and ef ciently communicate environmental concerns. In this section students will develop environmental maps using data from the EPA and other organizations. ACTIVITY 21.5.1 Tracking Radioactive Fallout In 1953, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission pre-dicted that nuclear generators would eventually make electricity \" too cheap to meter. \" In the years that followed, the nuclear power industry grew dramatically, but the promise of extremely cheap electricity was never realized, due in part to expen-sive safety measures necessary to contain such reactions and the radioactive waste generated. The need for such safety requirements was underscored by an explosion at a nuclear reactor in Chernobyl, Ukraine, on April 26, 1986. Radioactive materials were spewed high in the atmosphere, and winds carried the radioactive cloud west into Europe and east across Asia, straining relations with nations that experienced radioactive fallout. The tragic explosion provided meteorologists a rare opportunity to study wind movement. Table 21.4 lists the dates on which the radioactive cloud was rst detected in parts of Europe. On the map provided in Figure 21.21 , chart the fl ow of the radi- oactive cloud across Europe by placing the number Table 21.4 Tracing Radioactive Fallout from Chernobyl, 1986 Day Date City 1 April 26 Chernobyl, Ukraine 2 April 27 Gdansk, Poland 3 April 28 Stockholm, Sweden; Helsinki, Finland; Oslo, Norway 4 April 29 Trondheim, Norway; Copenhagen, Denmark; Prague, Czechoslovakia 5 April 30 Munich, Germany; Vienna, Austria; Geneva, Switzerland 6 May 1 Rome, Italy; Budapest, Hungary; Zagreb, Yugoslavia; Paris, France 7 May 2 Reykjavik, Iceland; Bucharest, Romania; Brussels, Belgium; London, England 8 May 3 Glasgow, Scotland; Athens, Greece; Ankara, Turkey 9 May 4 Beirut, Lebanon \u00a5\" \u00a5! \u00a5E\u00a5A\u00a5\u00a5\u00a53Chernobyl Figure 21.21 Map for Plotting the Spread of the Radioactive Cloud from Chernobyl, 1986 c21.indd 444 c21.indd 444 5/9/08 6:08:39 PM 5/9/08 6:08:39 PMMapping and Visualizing Scienti c Data 445 of the day on the appropriate cities.

What other events can meteorologists use to track large movements of air? ACTIVITY 21.5.2 Tracking Air Pollution One of the many tasks of the EPA is to measure air pollution and report ndings to the public. Each day the EPA, in cooperation with other federal and local agencies, measures ve major air pollutants Los AngelesSan Fernando Northridge MalibuSanta Dimas Lake Dimas Lake Unhealthy HazardousAir quality index (AQI)8:00 AM 12:00 noon 8:00 PM 4:00 PM Figure 21.22 Sample Air Quality Index Map for a Summer Day in Los Angeles Source: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

AQI values less than 100 are considered acceptable; those over 100 are not (Figure 21.22 ). When AQI numbers are high (bad air quality), schools may be required to cancel physical educa-tion and sports activities, and industries may be required to reduce polluting activities. What is the air quality in your region? Log on to the EPA air quality Web site ( airnow.gov ), look on sciencesourcebook.com , or search 5/9/08 6:08:40 PM 5/9/08 6:08:40 PM446 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science maps \" and determine the current air quality for the area closest to you. 1. Report the current composite air quality index (AQI), as well as the values for ozone and par-ticulate matter. 2. Examine map archives for air quality (e.g., ground - level ozone, particulates) during the past year for your same region. Identify the month during which the air pollution appears to be worst. 3. Compare daily animated maps for this month to see if there are any daily trends in air ozone levels. For example, do ozone levels vary dur-ing the day, and if so, at what times are they highest and lowest. 4. Open the animated map archive for the Los Angeles basin in California, an area known for air pollution. Examine the animation thumb-nails (small pictures), and select a month during which ozone pollution seems to be a problem (e.g., September). Run the animations, and record the approximate time of day that ozone pollution appears to be the worst (see Figure 21.22 ). Is this true for other days during this month? What man - made and natural fac-tors may explain this trend? ACTIVITY 21.5.3 Environmental Hazards in Your Community The mission of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is to protect human health and the environment. The EPA enforces the regulations of environmental laws enacted by Congress. All com-panies or organizations that produce, ship, or store hazardous chemicals must register with the EPA, and in turn the EPA shares this information with the public. Citizens can learn about the poten-tial hazards in their neighborhoods by looking at maps produced by the EPA (EnviroMapper at epa.gov), or look on sciencesourcebook.com or search \" EnviroMapper, EPA maps. \" Figure 21.23 is a map of a hypothetical com- munity showing the location of hazardous waste producers, air pollutant emitters, and Superfund sites. Hazardous waste sites include any entity that generates, transports, treats, stores, or disposes of hazardous waste. For example, automobile service centers must register with the EPA as hazardous waste sites if they change engine oil or radiator fl uid. Many electric power plants, steel mills, fac- tories, and other heavy industries release pollut-ants into the air and must therefore register as \" air emissions \" sites. These sites may be forced to curtail activity if air pollution values rise too high. Superfund sites require federal intervention to clean up. Use the EPA or similar Internet resource to generate environmental maps showing the hazard-ous waste producers, air pollutant emitters, and superfund sites in your community and in a local industrial area. 1. Are there EPA registered sites in either of the two sites you selected? 2. Identify the EPA registered sites on your maps, and determine the toxic substances they use, produce, or release. 3. Is there any correlation between the regis- tered sites and geographic features such as rivers, lakes, streets, or railroads? Explain your answer. 21.6 Astronomy Maps Early explorers relied on their knowledge of the night sky to determine latitude and longitude. Latitude can be determined by measuring the alti-tude (angle above the horizon) of Polaris, the North Star (Figure 21.24 ). If, for example, Polaris is 45 degrees above the horizon, you can conclude Hazardous waste Superfund site Air emissions Joe's Gas StationAmerion Electroplating Tran's TransmissionCity CleanersOtto's Autobody Repair Figure Sample 446 c21.indd 5/9/08 6:08:40 EastCelestial Sphere azalt viewerPolaris Figure 21.24 Determining the Latitude from Polaris that you are on the 45th parallel (45 degrees north latitude), and if it is at 50 degrees, you must be on the 50th parallel. Explorers Robert Perry and Matthew Henson knew in 1909 they had reached the geographic North Pole (90th parallel) when the North Star was directly overhead (90 degrees above the horizon). Although latitude was easy for early explorers to determine, longitude was more dif- cult and required knowledge of the appearance of the night sky at different times of the year. The planisphere, an intricate dynamic star chart, was a device that provided such information. By match-ing the appearance of the night sky with a time - and latitude - dependent window in the planisphere, navigators could determine their longitude. T oday the planisphere is used primarily by amateur astronomers to locate and reference stars. In this activity, you will construct a planisphere and use it to identify stars and constellations in the night sky. ACTIVITY 21.6.1 Mapping the Stars Figure 21.25 (A-C) is a star chart showing the brightest stars in the sky (listed in italics) and the major constellations visible from the Northern Hemisphere. The size of a dot on the star chart is proportional to its brightness. Early astronomers imagined shapes of animals and heroes among the stars and gave these constellations (apparent groupings of stars) names that we still use. T oday these constellations are typically illustrated by lines connecting the major stars that only vaguely repre- sent the shapes the ancients envisioned. For exam-ple, Draco (near the center of the chart in Figure 21.25 ) vaguely resembles a dragon, from which its name is derived. Constellations help us locate stars and other celestial bodies. For example, each November, the Earth passes through the tail of an ancient comet, causing the Leonid meteor shower. These \" shoot-ing stars \" appear to radiate from the region of the constellation known as Leo, hence the name. Figure 21.26 shows the same stars as Figure 21.25 but does not include the constellations or names. 1. Draw and label each of the following constella- tions on Figure 21.26 by referring to Figure 21.25 : Cygnus (the Northern Cross), Ursa Major (the Great Bear, or Big Dipper), Ursa Minor (the Little Bear, or Little Dipper), Draco, Corona Borealis (the Northern Crown), Bootes, Pegasus, and Hercules. 2. Find and label these notable bright stars: Altair, Vega, Deneb, Sirius, Arcturus, and Betelgeuse. In many cities these may be the only identi able stars due to light pollution. 3. Each August, stargazers see many \" shooting stars \" from the Perseid Meteor shower (ema-nating from the sky around Perseus). Indicate on Figure 21.26 the location from which these meteors appear to originate. 4. Galaxies orbit around their center of mass, termed the galactic center. It is believed that the galactic center of our galaxy, the Milky Way, is in the direction of Sagittarius. On Figure 21.26 , label this region as the galactic center. ACTIVITY 21.6.2 Identifying Constellations A planisphere is used to identify stars, constel-lations, star clusters, and galaxies. In this activ-ity, you will build your own planisphere using Figures 21.25 and 21.27 . Glue a paper photo-copy of Figure 21.25 to a piece of stiff cardboard. Photocopy Figure 21.27 on transparency lm, and cut off everything outside the perimeter of the circle. Attach this circle to the cardboard using a for Teaching Science pin, brad, or similar fastener so that the top circle rotates directly over the circle on the bottom. Rotate the upper sheet so current time on its dial matches the current date on the bottom sheet. For example, if it is 7:00 p.m . on March 1, align the 7 p.m marker with the March 1 marker. The objects shown in the window will be visible from the Northern Hemisphere if it is night and there is no cloud cover or light pollution. Match 12:00 midnight on the upper circle with January 1 on the bottom circle and note which stars are visible. Repeat at 12:00 midnight for the rst of each month, and notice that the view changes throughout the year. The stars visible at midnight on January 1 are considerably different from those on July 1, hence astronomers refer to a \" winter sky \" and a \" summer sky. \" Realize, however, that the sky changes throughout the night as well.

In 24 hours, the stars appear to have rotated back to the position from which they began. This apparent rotation is due to the rotation of the Earth on its axis. Since Polaris is aligned with the Earth ' s axis (Figure 21.25 A), all other stars appear to rotate around it. Figure 21.28 A is a 4 hr exposure show-ing the apparent movement of the stars. The North Star is behind the peak, at the center of the con-centric arcs formed by the apparent movement of the stars. T o identify stars in the sky, hold the plani- sphere above your head with the arrow pointing north. Light pollution, clouds, and smog will reduce your ability to see, so it is suggested that you use this at least 2 hr after sunset in a rural location when there is no moonlight (New Moon). T o view the planisphere, use red light (red cello-phane over a fl ashlight works well) so your pupils do not constrict when looking at the (latitude) A B C Figure 21.28 (A) Four-Hour Exposure of the Stars.

Looking toward the northern horizon, identify Ursa Major (the Big Dipper), the most eas-ily recognizable constellation on the northern horizon due to its bright stars and distinctive dipper - like shape. The two stars at the end of the dipper \" cup \" can be used to point to Polaris, the pole star or North Star (Figure 21.25 C), a much dimmer star at the end of the handle in the Ursa Minor (the Little Dipper). 2. A sextant is a device used to determine the angle of elevation of a star, planet, or other object, and has been used for centuries by navigators to determine their position at sea. Make a sim-ple sextant using a protractor, straw, string, tape, and rock as shown in Figure 21.28 B. Tape the straw to the protractor and hang a rock or other object from a line connected to the protractor to create a plumb line (vertical line). Sight at a star, planet, or other object through the straw. The angle of elevation is measured as the angle between the plumb line and the ninety - degree (right angle) mark as shown in the Figure. 3. Use Polaris as a reference to identify as many of the following constellations as are visible: Cygnus (the Northern Cross), Ursa Major (the Great Bear, or Big Dipper), Ursa Minor (the Little Bear, or Little Dipper), Draco, Corona Borealis (the Northern Crown), Bootes, Pegasus, and Hercules. List the constellations you have identi ed. ACTIVITY 21.6.3 Identifying and Tracking Satellites In October 1957, the Soviets launched Sputnik, the rst arti cial satellite to orbit the Earth. In the years since, thousands of satellites have been thrust into orbit to provide weather forecasts, relay phone messages, perform experiments, monitor foreign armies, document environmental problems, and study the universe. Many of these satellites can be seen with the unaided eye, appearing as tiny bright dots, moving against the backdrop of the dark night sky. The straight line in Figure 21.28 A is the trace left by a satellite. The tracks of satellites are predict-able and are made public through various agen-cies. Certain satellites, such as the Hubble Space T elescope (Figure 21.28 C) and the International Space Station (ISS), are particularly brilliant because of their large size and refl ective panels. The goal of this activity is to identify satellites in the night sky using their current azimuth and altitude as reported on the Internet. Brightness is measured by magnitude. Vega, one of the best - known stars, is said to have a brightness of zero. Things brighter than Vega have negative values, and those that are dimmer have positive values. The Sun is the brightest object in the sky, having a brightness of /H11002 26.7. The full Moon has a brightness of /H11002 12.7, and the International Space Station can have a brightness of /H11002 2 if conditions are just right. Review satellite forecasts, and select a conven- ient time when a satellite of interest is particularly bright as seen from your location. Satellite orbits are highly predictable, and their fl ight schedules can be found on the Internet (see sciencesourcebook. com or www.heavens-above.com , or search \" satel- lite tracking \" ). Record the date, magnitude, time, altitude, and azimuth for viewing three notable satellites from your location (Table 21.5 ). Altitude is the angle of the satellite with reference to the horizon (Figure 21.24 ), and azimuth is the angle from true north. An object on the horizon has an altitude of 0 , and one directly overhead has an altitude of 90 . An azimuth of W indicates that the satellite is visible in the west, and an azimuth of WNW indi-cates that the satellite is visible between west and northwest. Some agencies may report the azimuth in degrees, with 0 or 360 /H11005 north, 90 /H11005 east, 180 /H11005 south, and 270 /H11005 west. Using a compass, map, or GPS device, ori- ent with respect to true north, and look in the appropriate region of the sky for your chosen satel-lite at the designated time. It should appear as a tiny white dot moving across the background of stars. Science Red lights or fl ashing lights are from airplanes, not satellites. The International Space Station is the largest and brightest satellite and can often be seen even in regions with substantial light pollution. 1. Which satellites were you able to observe? 2. Examine the prediction tables, and determine the time of day that satellites appear brightest. Explain why this is so. 21.7 Interpreting Aerial and Satellite Photographs From the earliest days of the space program, scien- tists have recognized the potential of satellites for collecting data on our planet. One of the earliest American satellites, the Explorer VII, launched in 1959, was equipped with an infrared sensor to study heat patterns on the surface of the Earth. T oday scienti c instruments onboard orbiting satellites provide researchers with data to study the Earth ' s environment and potential problems such as ozone depletion, deforestation, climate change, earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricanes, and ocean temperature varia-tions. For example, the T opex/Poseidon satellite pro-gram has helped oceanographers understand and predict El Ni \u00f1 o patterns, temperature changes in the Paci c Ocean that dramatically infl uence weather worldwide. In this section, students will examine aerial and satellite data to better understand Earth. ACTIVITY 21.7.1 Interpreting Aerial/Satellite Photos of Earth A variety of sites on the Internet (such as \" satellite photos \" ) offer satellite and aerial photographs of the Earth ' s surface. Many street mapping services also offer hybrid views in which street names are super-imposed on images. Y ou can locate positions by address or GPS coordinates (latitude and longi-tude). For example, the GPS coordinates 46.20213, /H11002 122.20177 locate a satellite view of Mount Saint Helens, a composite volcano in the Cascades of Washington that erupted in 1980. The rst number in a GPS coordinate pair generally represents lati-tude, and the second represents longitude, meas-ured in degrees. A positive latitude indicates a position north of the equator, and a negative longitude indicates a position west of the prime meridian that separates the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. If you enter the coordinates 36.01524, /H11002 114.73856 and zoom in, you will see Hoover Dam, a structure that stores water and provides hydroelectric power for much of the American Southwest. Table 21.6 shows the GPS coordinates of a number of sites of scienti c interest. 1. Using the online aerial and satellite photo resources, match the coordinates in Table 21.6 with the places listed below. Put the number of each location in the box immediately to the left of the latitude. Make certain you are using a satellite, aerial, or hybrid view. Zoom in to higher magni cation to see each feature clearly. If you are using a resource such as Google Earth, you can tilt the images to get a three - dimensional perspective. 2. Print satellite or aerial photographs of each feature. 3. Locate and print land - based photographs of each location using an image search engine (such as sciencesourcebook.com or images.google.com ).

(2) Satellites appear brightest just after dusk or just before dawn. At these times, they are outside the Earth ' s shadow and refl ecting light from the Sun. Since it is relatively dark at these times, they appear bright and easy to see. During the middle of the night, satellites are not eas-ily seen because they are generally in the shadow of the Earth. 21.7.1 See Table 21.8 . 21.7.2. (1) Students may nd many examples of each feature. Some of the most notable features are Olympus Mons (the tallest volcano in the Solar System, 18 N, 133 W), Valles Marineris (the largest canyon/crevice in the Solar System), and Hellas Planitia (the largest impact basin on Mars, with a diameter of 2300 km). (2) Students should note great similarities between the surface of Earth and Mars. Mars, however, does not have rain, and hence little erosion, although ancient evidence of erosion is abundant. Impact craters and other geologi-cal features are more noticeable on Mars than on Earth due to the lack of rain and erosion. c21.indd 457 c21.indd 457 5/9/08 6:08:48 PM 5/9/08 6:08:48 PM458Chapter Twenty-Two Science Inquiry and Research For the Teacher 458 22.1 Inquiry 459 22.2 Sensors and Probeware 461 22.3 Problem - Based Learning 465 22.4 Forums and Debates 466 22.5 Rotating Laboratories 468 22.6 Citing Research 470 Answers to Chapter Activities 471 For the Teacher Science is the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment. Science is investigative, and an emphasis on inquiry must be modeled in the classroom, just as it is practiced in the research laboratory. This chapter provides strategies and activities to engage students in sci-enti c research in which they de ne and answer their own questions. The National Science Education Standards were developed by the National Research Council to \" promote a scienti cally literate citizenry. \" The standards frequently encourage the use of inquiry in the science classroom, de ning it as \" a mul- tifaceted activity that involves making observa-tions; posing questions; examining books and other sources of information to see what is already known; planning investigations; reviewing what is already known in the light of experimental evidence; using tools to gather, analyze, and interpret data; proposing answers, explanations, and predictions; and communicating the results. Inquiry requires identi cation of assumptions, use of critical and logical thinking, and consid-eration of alternative explanations. \" 1 These skills are addressed in a wide variety of activities in this book, as referenced below: Making observations (Activities in section 5.2) Posing questions (Activities in section 23.1) Examining resources and reviewing what is known (Activities in sections 3.1, 22.5 ) Planning investigations (Activities in sections 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7) Using tools to gather, analyze, and interpret data (Activities in sections 19.1 to 19.5 and 22.2) Proposing answers, explanations, and predic-tions (Activities in sections 6.2 and 6.3) Communicating results (Activities 3.2, 3.4, and 3.5) c22.indd 458 c22.indd 458 5/9/08 6:16:54 PM 5/9/08 6:16:54 PM Science Inquiry and Research 459 contrasts with traditional instruction in which teachers present principles that students verify in the laboratory. Although inquiry is a power-ful approach, it is time - consuming and should be integrated with other instructional strategies. More recently, a 7 - E model has been proposed: Elicit, Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate, and Extend. 5 22.1 Inquiry Alfred Nobel, the Swedish chemist and industrial- ist who invented dynamite, dedicated his fortune to the establishment of yearly prizes for those making the most signi cant contributions to physics, chemistry, literature, peace, physiology, and economics. T oday the Nobel Prize is widely recognized as the supreme commendation in these elds of study. Table 22.2 lists a few of the Nobel Prize winners and what their discoveries led to. The Nobel Prize is awarded only to those who have asked and answered important questions. Each winner is an expert in inquiry. Scienti c inquiry is a process in which one asks testable questions and sets out to discover the answers. There is no single method of inquiry, but classroom science inquiry is characterized by the ve elements listed in Table 22.3 . These elements are not necessarily linear and may occur at any time during an inquiry. A special case of inquiry learning is problem - based learning (PBL). Students are assigned to teams and provided an ill - de ned problem. T eams must organize themselves, de ne objectives, assign responsibilities, conduct research, analyze results, and present conclusions. The problems are pur-posely ill de ned, causing team members to work collaboratively to de ne speci c issues, problems, and objectives. Such tasks mimic the problem - solving skills that professionals engage in, whether repairing automobiles or treating cancer patients. Problem - based learning employs open - ended ques-tions that are not limited to a single correct answer. The questions elicit diverse ideas and opinions and require students to work as a group. Problem - based learning naturally integrates various elds of study as students search beyond the traditional curricu-lar boundaries to develop solutions. The activi-ties in this chapter provide students opportunities to develop scienti c reasoning and skills through problem - based learning and other inquiry - based activities. Researchers have found that inquiry is a very effective learning technique. 2 A helpful way to visual- ize inquiry learning is with the 5 - E model proposed by Richard Bybee. 3 The 5 - E model (Table 22.1 ) is a constructivist approach, which provides students the opportunity to use logic and prior knowledge to build understanding. 4 The 5 - E model seeks to engage students in the lesson before exploration or explanation. This Table 22.1 The 5 - E Learning Cycle and Instructional Model Engage: Provide activities that access prior knowledge, capture student interest, and stimulate student thinking. Possible activities include counterintuitive demonstrations, intriguing movie clips, current events, and hypothetical questions. Explore: Provide students the opportunity to plan, collect, and organize data. Possible activities include designing and performing an investigation, solving a problem, and reading to collect further information. Explain: Students analyze data they have collected and formulate explanations. Possible activities include comparing, classifying, and analyzing data; building explanations; and supporting ideas with evidence. Elaborate: Students expand their understanding by applying it to real - world situations. Possible activities include giving examples of how the principles apply to other phenomena and making decisions based on new understandings. Evaluate: Students evaluate their understanding. Possible activities include determining the limits to ndings and ev aluating the authenticity and accuracy of information and conclusions. 459 c22.indd 459 5/9/08 6:16:55 PM 5/9/08 6:16:55 PM460 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Table 22.2 A Few Notable Nobel Prize Laureates Year Researcher Discovery Applications 1909 Guglilmo Marconi (Italy) Ferdinand Braun (Germany) Communication via radio waves Radio, TV , wireless Internet, satellite communication, cell phones 1918 Fritz Haber (Germany) Production of ammonia Synthetic fertilizers that increased worldwide agricultural production 50 percent 1962 Francis Crick (USA) James Watson (USA) Maurice Wilkins (USA) Structure of the DNA molecule Biotechnology, genetic analysis, understanding of genetics and inheritance 1965 William Shockley (USA) Walter H.

Why? Try to answer this question in the following inquiry investigation. Y our teacher will provide you with a set of density blocks obtained from a scienti c supply company (see sciencesourcebook.com , carolina.com, or search \" density blocks \" ). All of the blocks are the same size and thus have the same volume, but some sink and some fl oat in water. Determine the volume of the blocks by cubing the length of a side. Express the volume in cubic centimeters. Many supply companies provide blocks with a volume of 1 cubic inch (1 in. 3 = 16.4 cm 3 ). T est all blocks in a container of water, and record those that fl oat and those that sink. What makes some blocks fl oat and others sink? What will happen if you combine blocks? Connect blocks with rubber bands and record whether they sink or fl oat (Figure 22.2 ). Record the mass of each combination and the number of blocks, and note whether it sinks or fl oats. Plot the mass of each combination on the y - axis, and the volume on the x - axis. Indicate \" fl oaters \" with an open circle and \" sinkers \" with a closed circle. Try to get combinations that neither fl oat nor sink but stay suspended in the middle of the water column. Examine the evidence you have collected and answer the question, \" What deter-mines if an object will sink or fl oat? \" 22.2 Sensors and Probeware A sensor (probe) is a device that continuously detects and responds to stimuli such as tempera-ture, light, or motion. For example, an automobile is equipped with an acceleration sensor to detect rapid deceleration as occurs in serious accidents. Under normal acceleration and deceleration, no signal is sent to the airbag, but during rapid decel-eration, a command is sent to deploy the airbag with the intent of protecting passengers from injury. Sensors are used to monitor and control a wide array of industrial, medical, and consumer products, a few of which are listed below. Accelerometers : Accelerometers in cars detect rapid deceleration and trigger airbag deploy-ment in accidents. Accelerometers in laptop computers detect when the device is dropped, sending a command to park the hard drive to prevent loss of data. Temperature sensors : Buildings are equipped with thermostats that trigger air conditioners or heaters to keep temperatures in an accept-able range. Many re alarm systems employ temperature sensors to detect re. Light sensors: Streetlights are often equipped with light sensors that shut off electricity dur-ing daylight hours. Video cameras continu-ously monitor lighting conditions and control the aperture to ensure proper lighting while recording. Motion sensors: Doppler shift security systems detect motion and trigger burglar alarms. Pro-fessional baseball stadiums use motion sensors to record pitching speeds. Oxygen sensors: Cars are equipped with oxy- gen sensors to ensure complete combustion and reduce auto emissions. Cardiologists use oxygen sensors to monitor blood oxygen levels during surgery. Electromagnetic sensors: Traf c engineers install electromagnetic sensors to detect the presence of automobiles and trigger traf c lights to opti- mize traf c fl ow. Metal detectors rely on changes in the electromagnetic eld to locate hidden metal objects in structures or the ground. Pressure sensors: Airplanes are equipped with pressure sensors to detect air speed, elevation, and rate of climb. Industrial robots use pressure sensors to detect when they have made contact with the object they are assembling or repairing. Assemble Different Combina tions of Blocks (A) to See If They Float or Sink (B) Science Sensors and probeware have revolutionized scienti c research. Prior to the development of electronic sensors and computers, researchers had to continuously monitor experiments and record data. Manual data recording is a tedious, error - prone task, and researchers are unable to exam-ine events that take place very quickly or over very long periods of time by traditional manual methods. ACTIVITY 22.2.1 Commercial and Industrial Uses of Sensors Table 22.4 lists sensors that are commonly used in the classroom or laboratory. Each of these sen-sors has commercial applications as well. Identify a possible commercial application for each of the sensors listed in Table 22.4 . ACTIVITY 22.2.2 Probeware Experiments Probeware automates data collection and allows researchers to collect data continuously, even when the researcher is not present (Figure 22.3 ). Table 22.4 lists the sensors that are commonly used in secondary school and college classrooms. These sensors (probes) are available from various scienti c supply companies (such as pasco.com , vernier.com , or search \" probeware\") and can be purchased on the Internet. Develop a question. Write a research question that can be answered using the probeware you have available. For example, \" What is the effect of light intensity on photosynthesis in Elodea ? \" Tables 22.5 to 22.8 list investigations that can be performed with the appropriate sensors.

If you are having dif culty designing an experi- ment, you may wish to search the Internet for probeware - based experiments that are related to your research question. Make cer-tain to de ne your control and experimen- tal treatments, as well as your independent and dependent variables (see section 5.5 in Chapter Five ). sensor: acclerometerProbeware draws real-time graphsof data. Graphs can be saved as separate files or pasted into laboratory reports.

Interpret the data in the light of the question you asked. ACTIVITY 22.2.3 Creating Real - World Events to Match Graphs Although technology solves many problems, it can create others. For example, although calcula-tors allow people to perform complex tasks, many become so dependent on them that they never master basic arithmetic skills. Probeware could have this same effect since data are automatically collected and plotted, allowing students to perform dif cult experiments while never mastering skills of data collection and interpretation. This activity is designed to ensure that you develop an under-standing of the graphs produced by the computer. Figure 22.4 shows a series of graphs. Recreate these graphs using probeware and activities of your design. For example, Figure 22.4S shows a steadily declining mass. A constant downward slope like this may be achieved by placing a burn-ing candle or a hot cup of water on the electronic balance. As the candle burns, mass is lost to the atmosphere. As water evaporates from the cup, a similar graph is produced. In replicating the graphs, focus on general trends, and don ' t worry about matching the graphs precisely.

Legislators often rely on commissions, think tanks, special interest groups, lobbyists, and others who have greater understand-ing of the issues. The Brookings Institute, Rand Corporation, Hoover Institution, World Resources Institute, and Heritage Founda tion are a few of the many think tanks that generate reports that legisla-tors use to guide their decision - making process. In the activities that follow, you will be a member of a think tank and generate a report to share with \" legislators. \" Follow the steps in the problem - based learning (PBL) model as you pre-pare your report, policy, or action plan. 1 . Knowns: What does your study group already know? List all relevant information pertaining to the subject. 2 . Ideas: What ideas or hypotheses do you have based on information you already possess? List your current ideas prior to research. 3 . Unknowns: What do you need to know? What are your learning needs? Prepare a list of ques-tions that should be answered before you proceed. 4 . Plan: Who will collect the information? Assign responsibilities for data collection. 5 . Problem: What is your problem? De ne your problem in a one - to two - sentence statement. 6 . Analysis: What do the data say? Analyze and discuss your data as they pertain to the problem. 7 . Report: Prepare a report in which you state your ndings, inferences, predictions, and recom- mendations. Support arguments, conclusions, and recommendations with evidence, and state any assumptions that have been made. ACTIVITY 22.3.1 Preparing Reports, Policies, and Action Plans Select one of the following issues, and prepare a report following the PBL steps listed above. Preparing for disaster: Y our city council has just appointed you to an earthquake (or tornado, hurricane, fl ood, volcano, re, meteor strike, or other natural disaster) preparedness committee. Y our committee is charged with assessing the risks, creating a disaster preparedness plan, and informing the community. Saving endangered species: The mountain gorilla is a rare and endangered species living in the mountains of Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Develop a plan for saving the mountain gorilla from extinction. Alternatively, your committee may develop a plan for saving the Asian elephant, giant panda, black rhinoceros, chimpanzee, tiger, or other endangered species. Predicting the impact of tropical deforestation: Tropical rain forests comprise less than 2 per-cent of the Earth ' s surface area but account for more than 50 percent of all plant and ani-mal species. Satellite photos from NASA show extensive deforestation in the Amazonian basin, equatorial Africa, and southeastern Asia. The United Nations has contracted your company to write a report predicting the biological, hydro-logical, climactic, economic, and social impacts of tropical rain forest deforestation. Evaluating environmental legislation and trea- ties: The Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer is an international treaty designed to protect the Earth ' s ozone layer from destruction by man - made chemi-cals. Nearly all nations have signed the treaty, making it the most widely adopted treaty to date. The United Nations has hired your team to evaluate the economic, scienti c, envi- ronmental, and social impacts of the treaty. Alternatively, your team may select to evalu-ate the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the United States Endangered Species Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, or the National Environmental Policy Act. Developing an energy policy: Many experts agree that we have passed the period of peak oil pro-duction and that worldwide demand for oil will exceed production in the years to come. c22.indd 465 c22.indd 465 5/9/08 6:16:58 PM 5/9/08 6:16:58 PM466 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science The U.S. Department of Energy has hired your company to serve as a consultant for drafting a new energy policy. Y our company must evaluate the seriousness of the issue and develop a plan that will incorporate a wide variety of innova-tive technologies to keep energy supply at pace with growing energy demand. Serving as an expert witness in court: Lawyers often call on the technical expertise of scientists when preparing their cases for the courtroom. A prominent legal team has hired your com-pany to evaluate the claims of clients who say that groundwater pollution from a local land- ll has entered the water supply, resulting in increased illness in the community. Judging medical malpractice: As a member of an arbitration team, you are often called to set-tle disputes. Both parties agree to abide by your decisions, but expect a fair and impartial ruling based on solid evidence. Y our current case deals with an athlete who claims that his physician did not adequately repair his anterior cruciate ligament, and as a result he can no longer play professional football. Protecting the coasts: More than 60 percent of the population of the United States lives within 50 mi of the coast (Paci c Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Arctic Ocean, or the Great Lakes). This percentage is expected to increase as America ages and retirees move to coastal communities. Coastal development has resulted in degraded coastal water quality, a reduction in the quan-tity and diversity of coastal wildlife, increased coastal and shoreline erosion, decreased open space for public use, and other ecological prob-lems. Develop a report for the U.S. Interior Department and state coastal commissions. Y our report should address concerns and trends, and propose workable solutions to protect coastal resources during a period of population growth. 22.4 Forums and Debates Scienti c research fl ourishes when there is open dialogue among researchers. The principal forums for such dialogue are professional meetings, journals, and online discussions. There are numerous organizations devoted to scienti c research, ranging from very broad - based inter-est groups such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science to highly special-ized groups such as the Society of Neuroscience, Society of Wetland Scientists, and Soil Science Society of America. N early all of these organi- zations hold periodic meetings at which mem-bers present their latest research and ndings. In addition, these organizations sponsor journals in which research is published and disseminated. These journals require peer review, meaning that experts in the eld have reviewed and approved the article for publication. The following are some of the best - known journals: Science \u2014 American Association for the Advance- ment of Science Physics Today \u2014 Institute of Physics Journal of the American Chemical Society \u2014 American Chemical Society Journal of the American Medical Association \u2014 American Medical Association Geology \u2014 Geological Society of America Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences \u2014 National Academy of Sciences Scientists share their ndings with the public through general interest journals such as Nature, Scienti c American, and Science News. Although these journals and organizations are essential to science, they do not provide a forum for young or novice researchers. Fortunately, there are venues, such as Journal of Student Research Abstracts (an annual journal for young investigators and their teachers) and science fairs (see Chapter Twenty - Three ) where young researchers can present their ndings. In addition, young researchers can publish their ndings on the Web so that other students and scientists can see their work. ACTIVITY 22.4.1 Developing Electronic Forums, Blogs, and Web Sites A threaded electronic discussion group or forum affords students the opportunity to post their c22.indd 466 c22.indd 466 5/9/08 6:16:58 PM 5/9/08 6:16:58 PM Science Inquiry and Research 467 ideas or research so others can read and comment. Figure 22.5 shows the framework of a typical dis-cussion group. The instructor establishes the basic framework of the forum, and students reply within these threads. In this example, the instructor established the major thread (major topic): environmental issues. Students then started minor threads (minor topics) of deforestation, ozone hole, global warming, and deserti cation. Students interested in writing about deforestation would select this thread and read all of the related messages before posting their own reply. Using a threaded discussion group, students can post the ndings of their research and request comments and suggestions. Alternatively, teach-ers can post questions or activities, and students can reply online, and read or critique the contri-butions of their peers. Newsgroups can be used for a variety of purposes. Prompts for the indi-vidual discussions should invite comment. For example, in Figure 22.5 , a prompt at the top level of the deforestation discussion could be, \" Explain the reasons for rapid deforestation in the past 50 years \" or \" What are the effects of deforestation in the Amazon rain forest? \" Create an electronic discussion group using a free online service, or respond to the online prompts of a discussion group created by your instructor. Alternatively, you may want to publish a Blog (web log) showing the progress of a science project you are working on, develop a Web site in which you publish your experimental or library science research, or publish a movie of your work to an amateur movie database (look on science sourcebook.com , groups.google.com , or movies. google.com , or search \" newsgroups \" ). ACTIVITY 22.4.2 Science, Technology, and Public Policy Debates Debate is a formal method of presenting argu-ments with the purpose of persuading oth-ers of the merits of a particular position on an issue. Legislators debate issues so they can make informed decisions. Candidates debate issues so citizens can decide how to cast their votes. Debates follow structure protocols, and participants must follow speci c rules. Traditionally one side presents its case, followed by the opposing side. Each side is then provided time for a rebuttal to refute the arguments or claims of its opponent, and then there is time for a closing argument from both sides. In this activity, you will debate various issues on their scienti c, technological, and social merit. Unless otherwise speci ed by your teacher, use the format that follows (Figure 22.6 ): Debate Format Prior to the debate. Each debater submits his or her notes to the teacher, citing references as appropriate (see section 22.6). Introduction (2 minutes per debater). Each debater delivers a prepared speech, focusing on one or more issues relevant to the debate statement. All members of the team in favor of the statement speak rst, followed by all mem- bers of the team opposing the statement. Preparation for rebuttal (3 minutes). Debaters are given the opportunity to prepare a rebuttal. Rebuttal (1.5 minutes per debater). Each debater is given the opportunity to refute or contra-dict the statements of opponents. Questions. The audience is given opportunity to ask questions of the debaters. ELECTRONIC DISCUSSION GROUP/BIOLOGY John Muir High School 1. ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES by NH Mar 7, 16:35 1.

The federal government should establish renewable - fuel standards. Nuclear power should be expanded. Recent severe weather patterns are a result of global warming. Tradable pollution credits safeguard the environment. Government funding of the space program helps the national economy. Ethanol - fuel production should be subsidized by the government. Transgenic monoculture crops should be banned. Conservation is a luxury only wealthy nations can afford. Local sanitary land ll standards are too lax. The local community should build a trash - to - electricity generator. Increases in skin cancer are a result of a diminished ozone layer. The federal government should subsidize the search for new oil reserves. The federal government should establish a shing quota program. 22.5 Rotating Laboratories Many schools are unable to offer their students adequate laboratory experiences due to limited resources. It is often unfeasible to offer activi-ties that use microscopes, computers, probeware, oscilloscopes, and other expensive laboratory equipment. T o provide meaningful hands - on experiences with limited equipment, teachers should consider rotating students through labora-tory activities rather than engaging them simulta-neously in the same activity. Using the rotational approach, students are divided into lab groups and assigned to a sequence of activities. Since only a fraction of the class is engaged in a given activity on any day, teachers need only acquire a fraction 2 minutes Pro 2 minutes Contopic 21.5 minutes Pro 1.5 minutes Contopic 1 1.5 minutes Pro 1.5 minutes Contopic 23 minutes - Prepare for rebuttalQuestions for Pro1 minute Questions for Con 1 minutePresent sides Rebuttal Consultation Questions Introduction 2 minutes Pro 2 minutes Contopic 1 Teacher introduces debate topic and teams 1 minuteScience & Technology Debate Schedule time - 20 minutes one student per topic topics/students can be added as necessary Figure 22.6 Sample Science and Technology Debate Format c22.indd 468 c22.indd 468 5/9/08 6:16:59 PM 5/9/08 6:16:59 PM Science Inquiry and Research 469 of the equipment than if all of the students per- formed the same activity simultaneously. Figure 22.7 shows a schedule for a class of 36 students in which 3 students are assigned to each of 12 laboratory groups. On day 1, groups 1, 5, and 9 do activity 1; groups 2, 6, and 10 do activity 2; groups 3, 7, and 11 do activity 3; and groups 4, 8, and 12 do activity 4. On day 2, all of the teams move to a new activity (Figure 22.7B ). In this example, the teacher must acquire only one - fourth as much equipment as would be needed if all of the students performed the activity simultaneously (Figure 22.7C). Figure 22.7A shows a hypothetical schedule for a team of three students. Each student serves as captain, teacher, and scout at least once in every rotation. For example, student 1 serves as the cap-tain of the enzyme and genetics activities, as the teacher of the respiration activity, and as the scout during the photosynthesis lab. The captain of an activity has the responsibility of organizing the investigation, collecting the written contributions of all team members, and editing and submitting the nal laboratory report. The scout participates in the current investigation with his or her team, but also looks for opportunities to observe the activity that his or her group will be doing next. As time permits, the scout consults with the teacher of the upcoming activity to learn the procedure photosynthesisrespiration geneticsenzymes photosynthesisrespiration geneticsenzymes photosynthesisrespiration geneticsenzymesGroups 1, 2, 3, 4 Groups 5, 6, 7, 8 Groups 9, 10, 11, 12 Lab 1 Lab 2 Lab 3 Lab 4 Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Group 1 1-enzymes 2-respiration 3-photosynthesis 2-respiration Lab 2 Lab 3 Lab 4 Enzymes Respiration Photosynthesis Genetics Captain Teacher Scout Captain Scout Captain Teacher ScoutStudent 1 Student 2 Student 3 Teacher Scout Captain TeacherGroup 1A B C Figure 22.7 Rotating Laboratory: (A) Team Assignments.

It is the teacher ' s responsibility to provide the scout of the next team with information that will allow it to move more ef ciently through the activity. In the exam- ple (Figure 22.7 ), the scout of group 1 consults with the teacher of group 2 so that he or she can be an effective captain of that activity on the next day of the rotation. Similarly, the scout of group 2 consults with the teacher of group 3, so he or she can be prepared to serve as captain of this activity on the next day of the rotation. In a traditional (nonrotating) scheme, the instructor prepares the entire class for the labora-tory on the day prior to the activity. Such prepara-tion is generally not feasible in the rotating scheme because of the variety of simultaneous activities. Y ou may wish to provide an extra day at the begin-ning of the rotation since groups will not have had the opportunity to watch their peers. Extra time allows each group to perfect its rst activity so it can get better results and more adequately prepare subsequent groups. Since each group builds on the experiences of those who precede them, the per-formance of the last group to do a given activity should be better than that of the rst group. For example, group 1 should do best on the genetics activity (Figure 22.7B ) because the members will have learned from group 3, which learned from group 2, which learned from group 1. The rotational laboratory approach affords students the opportunity to work with equipment and perform experiments and activities that would otherwise be unavailable to them. It also fosters a cooperative environment in which students learn from each other and ultimately develop better techniques and obtain better results than they do in a one - day, one - activity approach. The rotational laboratory approach more closely models the world of scienti c investigation in which research teams share their ndings with their colleagues. 22.6 Citing Research Scientists do not work in a vacuum. They rely heavily on the ideas and ndings of others. It is essential that scientists, as well as other researchers and writers, appropriately cite the work of others. Presenting the writing of another as one ' s own work is known as plagiarism and is considered a serious form of academic dishonesty. Plagiarism is sometimes intentional, but often it is uninten-tional as writers forget to adequately cite the ideas and writings of others. Writers should place bor-rowed text in quotations, and provide footnotes or endnotes that reference the source of the quoted work. Similarly, it is important to cite the ideas of others. Science teachers can check for poten-tial plagiarism in many ways, the easiest of which is through a commercial service such as Turnitin ( www.turnitin.com ), which checks student work against millions of Web sites and other student papers. T o avoid accidental plagiarism, students should keep notes copied from the Internet in a different le from the paper they write and place all copied material in quotes, citing their refer-ences. They should also cite ideas that come from other sources. ACTIVITY 22.6.1 Detecting Plagiarism Plagiarism is very easy to detect with a commercial resource such as Turnitin. It can also be detected using Internet search engines. Search for identi-cal text on two or more pages, and see if proper citations have been used. T o do this, copy a sen-tence from a science article on one Web site (e.g., Wikipedia), and place it within quotes in the Find window of a search engine. The quotes force the search engine to look for the string of words in the order you have placed them. Compare the text against others on the Internet to see if text has been adequately cited or plagiarized. ACTIVITY 22.6.2 Building a Bibliography Various organizations have established guide-lines for writing style and the citation of refer-ences. The standards established by the American Psychological Association (APA), 6 Modern Language Association (MLA), 7 and the Council of Science Editors (CSE) 8 are widely used, but dif- fer one from another. I recommend science stu-dents use the CSE standards and have provided c22.indd 470 c22.indd 470 5/9/08 6:17:00 PM 5/9/08 6:17:00 PM Science Inquiry and Research 471 examples in Figure 22.8 . Find ve or more refer- ences on a science topic of relevance, including at least one book, one journal article, and one Web site. Cite your references according to the Council of Science Editors guidelines. Answers to Chapter Activities 22.1.1 Students will nd that termites will follow a fresh trail left by any Papermate or Scripto ballpoint pen.

What will happen if termites travel in opposite directions on the pen line and meet? Do workers and soldiers follow the trail equally well? Do they follow all colors of ink equally well? Are they following the ink trail or the indentation left in the paper by the pen? Will they follow pencil marks? Are they able to fol-low pen trails on newsprint, photocopy, and notebook paper equally well? Do they follow all manufacturers ' pens equally well? Look for and encourage the charac-teristics of classroom inquiry (Table 22.3 ) as students engage in this activity. 22.1.2 Put all student data on the board or projector. Students can then plot these data on graph paper or with a spreadsheet program (see Chapter Twenty and Figure 22.9 ). Students may note that an imaginary line separates the fl oaters from the sinkers and that the slope of this line is 1 g/cm 3 . Y ou may then ask them to measure the mass of a given volume of water using a beaker or graduated cylinder. When they plot this point on the chart, they will note that it falls on the line. Thus, they have discovered that things with a den-sity greater than water sink and those with a density less than water fl oat. Note that I have not mentioned the term density except with reference to the blocks. Rather than introducing students to the concept of density and having them verify it through measure-ment, the activity allows them to discover the concept and use it to answer questions and make predictions. Students have constructed their own understanding of density using prior knowledge and experience. 22.2.1 Student answers will vary, but should have the form shown in the introductory portion of section 22.2. 22.2.2 - 22.6 Answers will vary. c22.indd 6:17:00 PM 5/9/08 6:17:00 PM473Chapter Twenty-Three Science Projects and Fairs For the Teacher 473 23.1 Writing Research Questions 474 23.2 Developing a Research Proposal 486 23.3 Conducting Research 487 23.4 Sharing Your Findings 488 Answers to Chapter Activities 490 For the Teacher Science projects and fairs offer students a rare opportunity to engage in scienti c research. Unlike traditional classroom experiments and dem onstrations, science projects challenge stu-dents to develop their own questions, design their own experiments, conduct their own research, and present their own ndings. Students present their work with posters (Figure 23.1 A) and pres-entations to peers, parents, and other members of the community (Figure 23.1 B). Most science fairs provide recognition and awards for those who excel. The rst national science fair took place in 1942, when Science Service and the Westing-house Corporation offered the rst Science Tal- ent Search. 1 Since then, numerous school, district, county, and state science fairs have been developed to encourage students in scienti c research. The best - known international event is the Intel Inter-national Science and Engineering Fair, 2 which sponsors precollege research and provides millions of dollars in college scholarships. Science fairs spur adolescents toward academic excellence, much the way sporting events drive them toward athletic excellence. This effect is chronicled in the Universal Pictures movie October Sky, in which four boys from an impoverished coal - mining town in Appalachia earn top honors at the national science fair for their design and development of homemade rockets. This story, based on a historical novel by Homer Hickham ( Rocket Boys ), may inspire students to think big as they plan their projects. 3 The bene ts of science projects and fairs may last a lifetime, as they have for me, when my eighth - grade work in the development of a pin-hole camera sparked an interest in science that has never died. Unfortunately science projects and fairs can also engender a dislike toward research and science. Most students are ill prepared to engage in scienti c research, and most parents are unprepared to assist them. Unable to organ-ize ideas, design experiments, or acquire needed materials, many become overwhelmed and frus-trated. It is therefore critical that science projects and fairs be structured to provide clear paths for c23.indd 473 c23.indd 473 5/9/08 6:18:10 PM 5/9/08 6:18:10 PM474 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science a school whose students come from less - educated families, the science fair will be much more chal-lenging, but potentially more valuable, if done well. Perhaps the greatest challenge students face when conducting their own research is learning to write suitable research questions. The research question must be answerable, of interest to the student, and possible given the resources avail-able to the student. Review section 23.1 on writ-ing research questions, and adapt it to the needs of your students. Students should become pro cient in writing research questions before they settle on one for their science project. \" People don ' t plan to fail, they just fail to plan! \" This truism is particularly apt as it relates to science projects. There is a tendency to want to answer the question before thinking deeply about how it can be answered. For this reason, it is important to require students to develop a research proposal before they begin their science projects. Section 23.2 provides directions for writing a research proposal, and these should be adapted to the needs of your students. Finally, section 23.3 sets out guidelines for conducting research and section 23.4 for writing reports and sharing results. 23.1 Writing Research Questions Most of us ask \" research \" questions on a regular basis, whether we realize it or not. Sometimes we ask observational questions, such as, \" What is my gas mileage? \" and other times we ask cause - and - effect questions, such as \" Will my car get better gas mileage at 60 or 65 miles per hour? \" Both types of questions are important but must be phrased well if they are to guide scienti c investigation. The following activities provide an opportunity to practice writing observational and cause - and - effect questions. ACTIVITY 23.1.1 Writing Observational Research Questions Most research starts with observations. The researcher documents patterns and trends that may provide the foundation for later causal research student success. If students are frustrated with their projects, they may become disinterested in science and research. For many years, American and Canadian col- leges and universities have graduated an insuf - cient supply of scientists and engineers to meet the demands of our technologically driven societies. 4 Low enrollment in college science programs is due in part to a culture of science - phobia that is prev-alent in many schools. Aware that science projects may contribute to this phobia, teachers should prepare their students well to ensure they have a positive experience and opportunity for success. This chapter provides information that will help students write research questions, proposals, and reports. I suggest that you review these mate-rials and adapt them for your student population. If you teach in a school whose students come from well - educated families, you will likely experience greater success with the science fair.

Observational studies can be quantitative (measured with numbers) or qualitative (based on description), but they are not experimental. The researcher records measurements and descriptions but does not alter independent variables to see their effect. Review the following observational ques-tions and identify which are quantitative (require the recording of speci c numbers) and which are qualitative (based on quality or character): 1. Are AM or FM radio signals stronger in tunnels? 2. Do soap bubbles last longer on warm or cold days? 3. What percentage of my class is right - eye - dominant? 4. Is the density of aphids greater on the top or bottom of rose leaves? 5. What is the current pH of my home tap water? 6. What is the average height of 2 - week - old rad- ish seedlings? 7. What is the maximum acceleration of the world ' s fastest roller coaster? 8. Are earthquakes more common near the coasts or inland? 9. Which cloud types are associated with rainstorms? 10. What is the average base height of cumulus clouds? 11. Write two quantitative and two qualitative observational questions. These questions should be related to the subject you are currently studying in class. ACTIVITY 23.1.2 Writing Experimental Research Questions An experiment is a scienti c procedure designed to test a hypothesis or make a discovery. The researcher compares the results of an experimental sample against those from a control sample that is treated the same except for the factor under inves-tigation. Experimental research questions must include an independent variable, dependent vari- able, and subject (see sections 5.5 and 5.6). The independent variable is the variable that the researcher selects or manipulates to determine if it produces changes in the dependent variable. The researcher looks for evidence that changes in the independent variable are correlated with changes in the dependent variable. Establishing a relation-ship between the independent and dependent vari-able may suggest or con rm cause and effect. The independent variable is independent of the depend-ent variable. It may be changed or controlled by the experimenter, but it is not affected by changes in the dependent variable. By contrast, the dependent var-iable is (potentially) dependent on the independ-ent variable. If there is a relationship between the independent and dependent variables, then changes in the independent variable will result in changes in the dependent variable. The researcher should hold all other factors constant to make certain that changes in the independent variable are responsible for changes in the dependent variable. Researchers must specify the subject of the study to clarify the extent to the ndings can be generalized. For example, a researcher may dem-onstrate that the optimal elevation for the giant redwood ( Sequoiadendron giganteum ), the larg- est living species, is 1400 to 2000 m in California ' s Sierra Nevada Mountains. No one can say, however, that this is the optimal elevation for the growth of the closely related coastal redwood ( Sequoia sem- pervirens ), the tallest living species that grows near sea level in California ' s Coast Range. The researcher must state the subject and conditions to which his or her ndings apply. The conditions are the parameters under which the study is conducted and may include any of a variety of key factors such as temperature, light intensity, and pH. There are many ways to write an experimental question, but the following formulas work well because they include independent vari- able, dependent variable, subject, and conditions: \" What is the effect of ( independent variable ) on (dependent variable ) in ( subject ) at ( conditions )? \" \" What is the relationship of ( independent vari- able) to ( dependent variable ) in ( subject ) at (conditions )? \" Tables 23.1 to 23.4 list common independ- ent variables, dependent variables, and subjects for research. Some subjects illustrate properties c23.indd 475 c23.indd 475 5/9/08 6:18:14 PM 5/9/08 6:18:14 PM476 Sourcebook for Teaching Science particularly well and are identi ed as such in the tables. Figure 23.2 A lists the components of exper-imental design, and Figure 23.2 B shows how these components are refl ected in data tables. Make cer- tain to include these components in your research and report. 1. Identify the independent variable, dependent variable, subject, and conditions in each of the sample life science questions that follow: (a) What is the effect of running at different speeds on the heart rate of healthy 17 - year - old boys at National High School? Components of Experimental Design Title : The title should summarize the research study and should include the name of the independent variable, the dependent variable(s), and the subject. Hypothesis : The hypothesis is a prediction concerning the relationship of the independent and dependent variables. Independent variable : The independent variable is manipulated, measured, or selected by the researcher to see if there is a change in the dependent variable. In a cause-and-effect relationship,the independent variable is the cause while the dependent variable is the effect or outcome. Dependent variable : The responding variable; a factor or condition that might change as a result of a change in the manipulated independent variable. Constants : All factors that remain the same for both the experimental and control treatments. The list of constants is extremely long and will vary with each experimental design. Constants mayinclude environmental factors (e.g. temperature, pH, humidity, pressure, light intensity), as well assubject factors (e.g. composition, age, species). Everything should be kept constant betweentreatments except the independent variable. Control treatment : The standard against which the experimental treatment is compared. Usually the independent variable is in the \"default\", or normal state. Experimental treatment : The test group in which the independent variable is varied to see if there is a change in the dependent variable. Repetition : All experiments should be repeated to determine average values and trends. 94 0 6 0 7 2 8 3 2 1 12 34 55 76 98 0 31 27 5 32 0 00 0 0 2 14 15 97 58 6mL of carbon dioxide producedindependent variabledependent variable The effect of temperature on yeast respiration.subject repetitionsHypothesis: Yeast respiration will increase as temperature increases from 0 \u00b0to 40 \u00b0C*hypothesi s constant slevels of independentvariable the way the dependent variable is measured the measure of the dependent variableExperimental Design & Data TablesA B * holding pressure, sugar concentration, and yeast concentration constant Figure 23.2 (A) Components of Experimental Design.

Such a plan is known as a research proposal. Professional scientists submit research proposals to major funding agencies to receive the funds neces-sary to do their research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF) are two of the many agencies that review pro-posals and award grants to scientists who have pre-sented interesting, useful questions, and clear plans for how they intend to answer them. Student researchers should develop proposals before they engage in research as well. A research proposal addresses each of the fol- lowing points: Topic: Specify the domain, eld, and topic of the research. For example, if you are research-ing the factors that infl uence electrolysis, the domain is chemistry, the eld is electrochemis- try, and the topic is electrolysis. Research question: Develop an interesting, test- able question. Some questions are interesting but not testable. For example, you may have heard that cockroaches can survive the radiation emitted by a nuclear bomb, but since you can-not detonate a nuclear bomb and do not have access to equipment that would provide equiva-lent radiation, this question is not testable. Other questions may be testable but do not hold your interest. Y ou will have a dif cult time conducting research if you nd it useless or boring. Review section 23.1 for ideas for a research question. Hypothesis: A hypothesis is a proposed expla- nation or prediction and serves as the starting point for an investigation. Good hypotheses are based on careful observation and good rea-soning. For example, you may have noted that termites follow trails made by blue and black Papermate pens but do not follow trails made by other pens or pencils. Y ou might hypothesize that there is a special chemical in Paper mate inks that attracts termites, and hypothesize that termites will follow tracks made by green and red Papermate pens as well. A hypothesis should be based on observation, developed with logic, and able to be tested. Independent variable: The researcher manipu- lates, measures, or selects the independent vari-able to see if there is a change in the dependent variable. In a cause - and - effect relation ship, the independent variable is the cause, and the dependent variable is the effect or outcome. For example, in a study of the effect of tem-perature on the rate of diffusion of air fresh-ener, temperature is the independent variable that the experimenter changes to see its effect on the dependent variable, the rate of diffusion. Dependent variable: The dependent variable is the responding variable \u2014 a factor or condi-tion that might change as a result of a change in a manipulated, independent variable. For example, in a study of the effect of the color of light on plant growth, plant growth is the dependent variable. Control: A control is the standard against which the experimental treatment is compared. Usually the independent variable is in the default, or normal, state. For example, if you were inter-ested in the effect of fertilizer on plant growth, you would compare growth against a control, natural state in which no fertilizer is applied. Constant: Constants are the factors that remain the same for both the experimental and control treatments. The list of possible constants is extremely long and varies with experimental design. Constants may include environmental factors (e.g. temperature, pH, humidity, pressure, light intensity), as well as subject factors (e.g., composition, age, species). Everything should be kept constant between the experimental and control groups, except the treatments or independent variable. Measuring the variables and constants: Science requires measurement. Sometimes measure-ments can be made directly, but other times they must be made indirectly. A researcher who wants to measure seed production can do so directly by counting the number of seeds produced. By contrast, the researcher who wants to determine the rate of photosynthesis must do so indirectly c23.indd 486 c23.indd 486 5/9/08 6:18:19 PM 5/9/08 6:18:19 PM Science Projects and Fairs 487 by measuring the rate of carbon dioxide consumption, the rate of sugar production, or the rate of oxygen release. Specify whether your measurements will be direct or indirect, and describe the way you will make the measure-ments. Many science experiments rely on appear-ance rather than an easily measurable quantity such as length or time. In such instances, provide as accurate descriptions as possible. Materials: List the materials and resources you will need to conduct the experiment, and describe how you will acquire them. Experimental procedure: List the steps neces- sary to complete the experiment and answer your questions. References: Include a list of books, journal arti- cles, Web sites, scientists, and other resources you have used to gain background knowledge on this topic. Cite your references as described in section 22.6. Approval: Get approval from your teacher to ensure that your question is appropriate and your investigation feasible. Get approval from your parents to make certain that you will have their support and access to resources nec-essary to complete the research project. 23.3 Conducting Research Discoveries don ' t just happen. Isaac Newton didn ' t discover the laws of gravity just because an apple fell on his head, and Archimedes didn ' t discover buoyancy just by taking a bath. Newton, the father of classical mechanics and one of the greatest scientists of all times said, \" If I have ever made any valuable discoveries, it has been owing more to patient attention, than to any other talent. \" 5 Similarly, Thomas Edison, one of the most proli c and infl uential inventors of all time, commented, \" Genius is one per cent inspiration, ninety - nine per cent perspiration. \" 6 Popular literature describes \" Eureka! \" moments or \" Aha! \" discoveries when scientists experience great breakthroughs, but such apparently sudden discoveries don ' t occur in a vacuum. Louis Pasteur, the Father of Microbiology, aptly said, \" In the elds of observation chance favors only those minds which are prepared. \" 7 Pasteur ' s vast array of accom- plishments, including the development of the germ theory of disease, the process of pasteurization for preserving foods, and the development of the rst vaccine for rabies, didn ' t happen by chance. Pasteur, like all other scientists, had a \" prepared mind \" and therefore was able to see the signi cance of the \" chance events \" that occurred in his laboratory and the world around him. Discoveries don ' t just hap-pen; they are the result of signi cant preparation, observation, dialogue, and reasoning. Scienti c research requires a commitment of resources and time. One must acquire the tools nec-essary to do research and carefully record observa-tions and the results of experiments. The activities in this section focus on these fundamental processes. ACTIVITY 23.3.1 Developing a Budget and Acquiring Equipment Review the materials list from your proposal, and develop a budget for your project. Think of how you can acquire the materials with as little cost and time as possible. Indicate the source and cost of each item as illustrated in Figure 23.3 . Submit your budget to your instructor for review. Use inexpensive household alternatives whenever pos-sible. For example, plastic cups can substitute for glass beakers in a variety of applications, but be certain to check with your instructor to ensure that such substitutions are safe and viable. Section 22.6 lists common and inexpensive sources for chemicals, but again it is necessary to check with your instructor about the safety and viability of such products in the context of your investigation.

Scientists make written records of all observations and data because they do not know which will be of most value in mak-ing discoveries or answering questions. Create a research log in which you record all relevant infor-mation. Record the time and date of each obser-vation in a clear format, such as that illustrated in Figure 23.4 . Include your research log as an appen-dix to your nal report. 23.4 Sharing Your Findings The renowned scientist Isaac Newton said, \" If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoul-ders of giants \" 8 Newton could not have made his discoveries in astronomy, motion, forces, and calculus if it were not for the information he had learned from earlier researchers. Scientists share their ndings with others in many ways. They may talk on the phone, work in each other ' s laboratories, publish their ndings in journals, maintain logs on the Internet, or share with col-leagues at professional meetings. The following are some of the major professional science organi-zations and the journals they offer as forums for scienti c research: American Association for the Advancement of Science: Science American Astronomical Society: Astronomical Journal American Chemical Society: Journal of the American Chemical Society American Geological Institute: Geotimes American Physical Society: Journal of the American Physical Society Biophysical Society: Biophysical Journal School science fairs provide an opportunity for students to share their research with peers, parents, teachers, and other interested members of the community.

This sec- tion provides quotes about the nature of science and the reasons that famous scientists selected their career: George Washington Carver, African American botanist and inventor (1863 - 1943). Carver invented numerous uses for the peanut and other plants. I love to think of nature as an unlimited broad- casting station, through which God speaks to us every hour, if we will only tune in. Marie Curie, Polish physicist and chemist (1867 - 1934). Marie Curie, one of the most Sourcebook for Teaching Science The Nature of Science: A Position Statement of NSTA Preamble: All those involved with science teaching and learning should have a common, accurate view of the nature of science. Science is characterized by the systematic gathering of information through various forms of direct and indirect observations and the testing of this information by methods includ-ing, but not limited to, experimentation. The principal product of science is knowledge in the form of naturalistic concepts and the laws and theories related to those concepts.Declaration: The National Science Teachers Association endorses the proposition that science, along with its methods, explanations and generalizations, must be the sole focus of instruction in science classes to the exclusion of all non-scienti c or pseudoscienti c methods, explanations, generalizations and products. The following premises are important to understanding the nature of science. Scienti c knowledge is simultaneously reliable and tentative. Having con dence in scienti c knowledge is reasonable while realizing that such knowledge may be abandoned or modi ed in light of new evidence or reconceptualization of prior evidence and knowledge.Although no single universal step-by-step scienti c method captures the complexity of doing sci- ence, a number of shared values and perspectives characterize a scienti c approach to understand- ing nature. Among these are a demand for naturalistic explanations supported by empirical evidence that are, at least in principle, testable against the natural world. Other shared elements include observations, rational argument, inference, skepticism, peer review and replicability of work.Creativity is a vital, yet personal, ingredient in the production of scienti c knowledge. Science, by de nition, is limited to naturalistic methods and explanations and, as such, is precluded from using supernatural elements in the production of scienti c knowledge. A primary goal of science is the formation of theories and laws, which are terms with very speci c meanings.(1) Laws are generalizations or universal relationships related to the way that some aspect of the natural world behaves under certain conditions. (2) Theories are inferred explanations of some aspect of the natural world. Theories do not become laws even with additional evidence; they explain laws. However, not all scienti c laws have accompanying explanatory theories. (3) Well-established laws and theories must be internally consistent and compatible with the best available evidence;be successfully tested against a wide range of applicable phenomena and evidence;possess appropriately broad and demonstrable effectiveness in further research. Contributions to science can be made and have been made by people the world over. The scienti c questions asked, the observations made, and the conclusions in science are to some extent infl uenced by the existing state of scienti c knowledge, the social and cultural context of the researcher and the observer's experiences and expectations.The history of science reveals both evolutionary and revolutionary changes. With new evidence and interpretation, old ideas are replaced or supplemented by newer ones.While science and technology do impact each other, basic scienti c research is not directly con- cerned with practical outcomes, but rather with gaining an understanding of the natural world for its own sake. and Instruction 495 famous of all women scientists, was a pioneer in the eld of radioactivity. All my life through, the new sights of Nature made me rejoice like a child . . . . It was like a new world opened to me, . . . which I was at last permitted to know in all liberty. Thomas Alva Edison, American inventor (1847 - 1931). Edison established the rst industrial research laboratory. He was one of the most proli c inventors of all time, invent- ing a sound recording device (phonograph), motion pictures, and the rst practical incan- descent light bulb. He received patents for 1090 inventions. I never did anything worth doing by accident, nor did any of my inventions come by acci-dent; they came by work. Genius is one per cent inspiration and ninety - nine per cent perspiration. I have not failed. I ' ve just found 10,000 ways that won ' t work. T o invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk. Albert Einstein, German American theoretical physicist (1879 - 1955). Einstein formulated the special and general theories of relativity and made signi cant contributions to quan- tum theory and statistical mechanics. The most incomprehensible thing about our universe is that it can be comprehended. The important thing is not to stop question- ing. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Enrico Fermi, Italian - American physicist (1901 - 1954). Fermi developed quantum the-ory and the rst nuclear reactor. There are two possible outcomes: If the result con rms the hypothesis, then you ' ve made a measurement. If the result is contrary to the hypothesis, then you ' ve made a discovery. Galileo Galilei, Italian astronomer (1564 - 1642). Galileo was the father of modern astronomy and physics. \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007f I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use. Robert Goddard, American physicist, chemist, and engineer (1882 - 1945). Goddard was the pioneer of controlled, liquid - fueled rocketry. It is dif cult to say what is impossible, for the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow. Edwin Hubble, American astronomer (1889 - 1953). Hubble discovered cosmological red-shift and laid the foundation for physical cosmology. He was the rst to discover galax- ies beyond the Milky Way. Equipped with his ve senses, man explores the universe around him and calls the adven-ture Science. James Prescott Joule, English physicist (1818 - 1889). Joule discovered the rst law of ther- modynamics (conservation of energy) and the relationship of heat to mechanical work. It is evident that an acquaintance with natural laws means no less than an acquaintance with the mind of God therein expressed. Johannes Kepler, German astronomer and mathematician (1571 - 1630). Kepler discov-ered the three laws of planetary motion. The diversity of the phenomena of nat - ure is so great, and the treasures hidden in the heavens so rich, precisely in order that the human mind shall never be lacking in fresh nour ishment. Isaac Newton, English physicist, astronomer, theologian (1643 - 1727). Newton discovered the universal law of gravitation and laws of motion. He laid the foundations for classical mechanics and the development of calculus. I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only a boy playing on the sea - shore, and diverting myself in now and then nding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me. The Sourcebook for Teaching Science If I have ever made any valuable discoveries, it has been owing more to patient attention, than to any other talent. Louis Pasteur, French biologist and chemist (1822 - 1895). Pasteur developed the process of pasteurization, helped establish the germ theory of disease, was a cofounder of bacteri-ology, and developed new vaccines. Science belongs to no one country. In the eld of observation, chance favors only the prepared mind. Nikola Tesla, Serb - American inventor, physi- cist, and engineer (1856 - 1943) . T esla invented polyphase power distribution systems and the AC motor, laying the foundation for the sec-ond industrial revolution. I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success. Wernher Von Braun, German - American physi- cist and engineer (1912 - 1977). Von Braun was the father of the American space program and chief architect of the Saturn V rocket that took men to the Moon. Research is what I ' m doing when I don ' t know what I ' m doing. 24.2 Theories and Perspectives in Science Education Numerous theories and perspectives concerning the teaching and learning of science are addressed in this book. Here we look at a few of the more prominent ones. The numbers in parentheses refer to activity numbers in this book. Active Learning: Learn by Doing Active learning is a set of strategies that posits the responsibility for learning with the student. 3 Discovery learning, 4 problem - based learning (22.3), experiential learning, and inquiry - based instruction \u007f \u007f \u007f(22.1) are examples of active learning. Discussion, debate (22.4), student questioning (5.1, 22.1, 23.1), think - pair - share (25.7), quick - writes (25.7), poll-ing, role playing, cooperative learning (22.3, 22.5), group projects (13.1 - 8, 22.5), and student presen-tations (22.4) are a few of the many activities that are learner driven. It should be noted, however, that even lecture can be an active learning event if students process and lter information as it is pro- vided. Cornell notes (3.1) and diagramming (16.2) are a couple of activities that can make lectures active learning events. Teaching to Multiple Learning Modalities We can learn through any of our ve senses, but the three most valuable are vision, hearing, and touch. Theorists and practitioners claim that learn-ers have a preference for one learning style over another. Visual learners learn best by watching, auditory learners learn best by verbal instruction, and kinesthetic learners learn best by manipulation. Because of the demands of the profession, teachers often resort to the instructional style that requires the least time and preparation: lecture and discus-sion. Although these may be valuable approaches to teaching and learning, they fail to take advan-tage of other learning modalities and disenfran-chise students whose primary modality is visual or kinesthetic. This book emphasizes the use of all three modalities in teaching and learning. Teaching to Multiple Intelligences Intelligence is a property of the mind that includes many related abilities, such as the capacities to rea-son, plan, solve problems, comprehend language and ideas, learn new concepts, and think abstractly. Historically, psychometricians have measured intelligence with a single score (intelligence quo-tient, IQ) on a standardized test, nding that such scores are predictive of later intellectual achieve-ment. Howard Gardner and others assert that there are multiple intelligences, and that no single score can accurately refl ect a person ' s intelligence. 5 c24.indd 496 c24.indd 496 5/9/08 6:19:25 PM 5/9/08 6:19:25 PMScience Curriculum and Instruction 497 More important, the theory of multiple intelligences implies that people learn better through certain modalities than others and that science teachers should design curriculum to address as many modalities as possible. Gardner identi es seven intelligences (the numbers in parentheses indicate sections in this book that address each intelligence): Logical/mathematical intelligence is used when thinking conceptually (6.1 - 6.4, 7.1 - 7.7, 10.1 - 10.5, 13.9, 16.1 - 26.6, 18.1 - 18.3), computing (14.1 - 14.3, 15.1 - 15.7, 17.1 - 17.7, 20.1, 20.8), looking for patterns (1.1 - 1.4, 16.4, 16.6, 17.5 - 17.7), and classifying (8.1 - 8.6, 19.1 - 19.5) . Linguistic/language intelligence is used when learning by listening (21.1), verbalizing (1.1 - 1.4, 3.1 - 3.4, 11.2 - 11.4, 22.6), reading (2.1 - 2.4), translating (14.1 - 14.3), and discussing (8.6, 22.4). Naturalist intelligence is used to question (5.1, 22.1, 23.1), observe (5.2 - 5.3, 22.2), investigate (23.2), and experiment (5.1 - 5.10, 23.3 - 23.4). Visual/spatial intelligence is used when learn- ing with models (12.1 - 12.5), photographs (16.4, 16.6), videos (16.5), diagrams (8.1 - 8.6, 16.1 - 16.3, 20.2 - 20.7), maps (21.1 - 21.7), and charts (20.2 - 20.7). Bodily kinesthetic intelligence is used to process knowledge through bodily sensations (12.2), movements (12.2), and manipulation (22.2). Interpersonal intelligence is used when learn- ing through cooperative learning experiences (22.3, 22.5), group games (13.1 - 13.8), group lab work (22.5), and dialogue (8.6, 23.4). Intrapersonal intelligence is used when learning through self - dialogue (7.1 - 7.3, 11.1), studying (11.2 - 11.4), and self - assessment (7.4 - 7.7). Musical intelligence is used when learn- ing through rhythm, melody, and nonverbal sounds in the environment (24.8). Metacognition: Teaching Students to Think About Their Thinking John Flavell argues that learning is maximized when students learn to think about \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007fand consciously employ strategies to maximize their reasoning and problem solving capabilities. 6 Metacognitive thinkers know when and how they learn best and employ strategies to overcome bar-riers to learning. As students learn to regulate and monitor their thought processes and understand-ing, they learn to adapt to new learning challenges. Expert problem solvers rst seek to develop an understanding of problems by thinking in terms of core concepts and major principles (6.1 - 6.4, 7.1 - 7.7, 11.1 - 11.4). By contrast, novice problem solvers have not learned this metacognitive strat-egy and are more likely to approach problems simply by trying to nd the right formulas into which they can insert the right numbers. A major goal of education is to prepare students to be fl ex- ible for new problems and settings. The ability to transfer concepts from school to the work or home environment is a hallmark of a metacogni-tive thinker (6.4). Developing Higher - Order Reasoning Perhaps the most widely used classi cation of human thought is Bloom ' s taxonomy . 7 Benjamin Bloom and his team of researchers wrote exten-sively on the subject, particularly on the six basic levels of cognitive outcomes they identi ed: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Bloom ' s taxonomy (6.1) is hierarchical, with knowledge, comprehension, and application as fundamental levels and analysis, synthesis, and evaluation as advanced (6.1 - 6.4). When educators refer to \" higher - level reasoning, \" they are generally referring to analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. One of the major themes of this book is to develop higher - order thinking skills through the teaching of science. Constructivism: Helping Students Build Their Understanding of Science Constructivism is a major learning theory, and is particularly applicable to the teaching and lear- ning of science. 8 Piaget suggested Science accommodation and assimilation, individuals con- struct new knowledge from their experiences. 9 Constructivism views learning as a process in which students actively construct or build new ideas and concepts based on prior knowledge and new information. The constructivist teacher is a facilita-tor who encourages students to discover principles and construct knowledge within a given framework or structure. Throughout this book, I emphasize the impor- tance of helping students connect with prior knowledge and experiences as new information is presented so they can dispense with their miscon-ceptions (7.4 - 7.7) and build a correct understand-ing. Seymour Papert, a student of Piaget, asserted that learning occurs particularly well when people are engaged in constructing a product. 10 P a p e r t ' s approach, known as constructionism, is facilitated by model building (12.5), robotics, video editing (16.5), and similar construction projects. Pedagogical Content Knowledge in Science An expert scientist is not necessarily an effec- tive teacher. An expert science teacher, however, knows the dif culties students face and the mis- conceptions they develop and knows how to tap prior knowledge while presenting new ideas so students can build new, correct understandings. Schulman refers to such expertise as pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and says that excellent teachers have both expert content knowledge and expert PCK. 11 I n How People Learn, Bransford, Brown, and Cocking state, \" Expert teachers have a rm understanding of their respective disci- plines, knowledge of the conceptual barriers that students face in learning about the discipline, and knowledge of effective strategies for work-ing with students. T eachers ' knowledge of their disciplines provides a cognitive roadmap to guide their assignments to students, to gauge student progress, and to support the questions students ask. \" 12 Expert teachers are aware of common mis- conceptions and help students resolve them. This book is dedicated to improving science teacher pedagogical content knowledge. 24.3 Developments in Science Curriculum and Instruction Science is a dynamic endeavor, and each day brings new discoveries and raises new questions. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that the secondary school science curriculum is constantly evolving. Unlike many other countries, the United States does not have a federal system of education. As the Supreme Court stated in Everson v. Board of Education of Ewing Township, \" The Constitution says nothing of education. It lays no obligation on the states to provide schools and does not under-take to regulate state systems of education if they see t to maintain them. \" 13 Although the exclusion clause of the U.S. Constitution places education in the hands of the states, the federal government does affect policy by providing or withholding funds to states, districts, and schools that do or do not conform to federal policies. The development of American science educa- tion is varied and diverse, as each state, district, and school has had a voice in the way science is taught. Despite this decentralized approach, there are many national trends in American science education, and many initiatives and reforms have had national and international con-sequence. We look next at a few of them. 1893: Harvard Committee of Ten \u2014 Precollegiate Science Curriculum In 1892, the National Education Association organized the Harvard Committee of T en to recommend uniform college entrance require-ments. 14 The committee recommended science prerequisites for college applicants. In addition, it recommended that high school science classes have a signi cant laboratory component and that biology precede chemistry and physics. High schools conformed to the committee ' s recommen-dation, giving birth to the traditional laboratory - based science curriculum, with biology preceding the physical sciences. By 1920, general science, biology, chemistry, and physics were established c24.indd 498 c24.indd 498 5/9/08 6:19:25 PM 5/9/08 6:19:25 PMScience Curriculum and Instruction 499 as sequential year - long courses in most American high schools, and today most still offer science in this \" layer - cake \" sequence. 15 1950: National Science Foundation \u2014 Federal Funding for Science Education Prior to World War II, academic research in sci- ence and engineering was not considered to be a federal responsibility, and almost all support came from industry and private contributions. In 1950, President Truman signed Public Law 507, creat-ing the National Science Foundation (NSF) as an independent government agency supporting fun-damental research and education in science and engineering. Through the years, NSF has provided substantial funding for training science educators and developing science curriculum. 1955: Advanced Placement Program \u2014 College - Level Science Courses In 1955, the College Board established the Advanced Placement Program (AP) to provide students the opportunity to do college - level work while still in high school. The College Board de nes curriculum and offers yearly tests in more than 30 curricular elds. Students around the world take the standardized examinations, which include multiple - choice and free - response com-ponents. Most colleges offer applicants credit or advanced standing for suitable test scores. The Advanced Placement Program has experienced steady growth since its inception and is a model of sustained educational reform. Research indicates that that the Advanced Placement Program increases academic expecta-tions, 16 standards, professional development, 17 and student involvement at participating high schools. 18 The College Board offers Advanced Placement Programs in the sciences in biology, chemistry, physics, and environmental science. In 2006, AP courses were offered in more than 16,000 schools to more than 1.3 million students, many of whom were enrolled in one or more of the science offerings. 19 Most high schools and colleges calculate weighted grade point averages in which Advanced Placement classes are graded on a ve - point rather than a four - point scale. 20 I t is very dif cult to get into many selective institu- tions without Advanced Placement credits and the extra grade points they provide, and this has fueled interest in the program. 21 1958: National Defense Education Act \u2014 Developing Science Curricula In October 1957 the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the rst arti cial satellite to orbit the Earth. The fear that the United States had become technologically inferior to its cold war foe awak-ened a nationwide interest in science and tech-nology education. The 1958 National Defense Education Act (NDEA) provided federal aid for secondary science instruction and funded college students to pursue degrees in science and engi-neering. In addition, the NDEA and NSF funded numerous science curriculum development projects, including BSCS (Biological Sciences Curriculum Study), Chem Study (Chemical Education Materials Study), PSSC Physics (Physical Science Study Committee), and ESCP (Earth Science Curriculum Project). These cur-ricula became widely used throughout the United States, creating nationwide (not national or fed-eral) science curricula and ushering in what some have called the Golden Age of Science Education. 1969: National Assessment of Educational Progress \u2014 America ' s Report Card The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) was developed by the National Center for Education Statistics to be \" the Nation ' s Report Card. \" It remains the only nationally repre-sentative, ongoing assessment of what America ' s students know. 22 The NAEP assesses student knowledge in science and seven other areas. The 1996 assessment revealed that less than one - third of students were performing at or above the pro ciency level in mathematics and science. Poor c24.indd 499 5/9/08 6:19:26 PM 5/9/08 6:19:26 Sourcebook for Teaching Science performance on the NAEP has been an impetus for many educational reforms. 1983: Nation at Risk Report \u2014 The Call for Standards - Based Reform In 1983 the National Commission on Excellence in Education published an alarming report, A Nation at Risk, stating that \" if an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war. As it stands, we have allowed this to happen to ourselves. We have even squandered the gains in student achieve-ment made in the wake of the Sputnik challenge. Moreover, we have dismantled essential support systems which helped make those gains possi-ble. We have, in effect, been committing an act of unthinking, unilateral educational disarmament. \" 23 A Nation at Risk emphasized the need for educa- tional standards and standards - based assessments, both of which were instituted in succeeding reforms. In addition, it recommended that American high schools require three years of science for gradua-tion and that the federal government support cur-riculum improvement and research on teaching, learning, and the management of schools. 24 1990: Project 2061: Science for All Americans \u2014 Science Literacy and STS In 1990 the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world ' s largest scien-ti c society, issued a call for a long - term science education reform in its landmark report, Project 2061 : Science for All Americans. 25 T h e r e p o r t focused on the need for science literacy and said that a \" scienti cally literate person is one who understands key concepts and principles of sci-ence, [and] uses scienti c knowledge and reason- ing for individual and social purposes. \" Project 2061 emphasized the need to organize science around conceptual, transdisciplinary themes that would allow learners to link science concepts with math-ematics, history, economics, language, literature, political science, and the arts. Project 2061 encouraged an emphasis on conceptual themes to provide understanding across traditional curricular boundaries. In addition, it published Benchmarks for Scienti c Literacy with speci c goals and objec- tives for science curriculum. 26 Project 2061 has been widely cited in subsequent curricular reforms. 1990: Scope, Sequence, and Coordination \u2014 Integrated Science The National Science T eachers Association ' s (NSTA) Scope, Sequence, and Coordination Report (SS & C ) recommended that all secondary stu-dents study every science every year for six years, in courses integrating physics, chemistry, biology, and earth and space science. 27 Its recommenda- tion was based in part on an international model and called for an integrated approach to science that was radically different from the traditional layer - cake curriculum in which each science was taught in separate year - long courses. In the years following the SS & C report, numerous schools instituted integrated science curricula with the expectation that students would learn concepts across curricular lines in a coor-dinated program, starting with descriptive and phenomenological aspects of science and mov-ing through empirical and quantitative treat-ments to the abstract and theoretical concepts. Unfortunately very few curricular resources were developed to support integrated science, and few teachers were prepared to teach across curricular lines. The introduction of state standards with yearly assessments based on the traditional layer - cake sequence contributed to the demise of inte-grated science in many parts of the country. 1995: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study \u2014 Evaluating Science Education in an International Context Every four years since 1995, the National Center for Education Statistics has conducted an assessment c24.indd 500 c24.indd 500 5/9/08 6:19:26 PM 5/9/08 6:19:26 PMScience Curriculum and Instruction 501 to see how American students perform in an international context. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS) docu-ments a gradual decline in performance and interest in mathematics and science as American students get older, paralleling a drop in standard-ized science scores. 28 Among the 20 countries assessed in advanced mathematics and physics in 1999, none scored signi cantly lower than the United States in mathematics, and only one scored signi cantly lower in physics. The TIMMS is the largest and most comprehensive study ever under-taken of mathematics and science education. The study focuses on children who are in fourth, eighth, and twelfth grades. The 1999 TIMMS charged that American science courses were unfocused and shallow ( \" a mile wide and an inch deep \" ), provid-ing arguments for later reforms. 1996: National Science Education Standards Project \u2014 National Standards The National Research Council developed the National Science Education Standards to provide the qualitative criteria and framework for judg-ing the content, instruction, and assessment of science education in schools across the nation. 29 The standards de ne the understanding that all students should develop and present criteria for judging science education content at speci c grade levels. These standards are national in the sense that they are offered by a national organiza-tion, but they are not federal since education is the prerogative of the states. The standards offer many recommendations, including greater emphasis on pedagogical content knowledge, student under-standing, inquiry, and integration. 1998: California Science Content Standards \u2014 What Students Should Know In 1998, the California State Board of Education adopted science content standards for sixth (earth science), seventh (life science), and eighth (physical science) grades, as well as for high school biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. 30 T h e standards de ne speci c concepts students should master and provide the benchmark for district and state assessments. Other states followed California ' s example by de ning the science facts and concepts students should know after each grade or subject. 2001: No Child Left Behind \u2014 Holding Schools Accountable for Learning In 2001, the U.S. Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), emphasizing \" increased accountability for states, school districts, and schools; greater choice for parents and students, par-ticularly those attending low - performing schools; more fl exibility for states and local educational agencies (LEAs) in the use of federal education dol-lars; and a stronger emphasis on reading. \" 31 NCLB is based on the belief that what gets measured gets done. States are required to test student and school performance according to their established state standards if they are to receive full federal funding. T oday anyone can look online to examine the test scores of speci c schools and districts. States and districts must provide data on student achievement by subgroup, inform parents and the community of the scores of each school, and dis-seminate report cards on school and district per-formance. NCLB fueled a variety of state and local initiatives in standards - based reform and perform-ance - based education. 2005: Rising Above the Gathering Storm \u2014 The Need for Scientists In response to soaring trade de cits and the export of numerous high - tech jobs to rapidly develop-ing nations, the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine commissioned Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future, a report that noted: Without basic scienti c literacy, adults cannot participate effectively in a world increasingly c24.indd 501 c24.indd 501 5/9/08 6:19:27 PM 5/9/08 6:19:27 PM502 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science shaped by science and technology. Without a fl ourishing scienti c and engineering com- munity, young people are not motivated to dream of what can be, and they will have no motivation to become the next generation of scientists and engineers who can address per-sistent national problems, including national and homeland security . . . For the rst time in generations, the nation ' s children could face poorer prospects than their parents and grandparents did. We owe our current pros-perity, security, and good health to the invest-ments of past generations, and we are obliged to renew those commitments in education, research, and innovation policies to ensure that the American people continue to bene t from the remarkable opportunities provided by the rapid development of the global econ-omy and its not inconsiderable underpinning in science and technology . . . Because other nations have, and probably will continue to have, the competitive advantage of a low wage structure, the United States must compete by optimizing its knowledge - based resources, particularly in science and technology, and by sustaining the most fertile environment for new and revitalized industries and the well - paying jobs they bring. We have already seen that capital, factories, and laboratories readily move wherever they are thought to have the greatest promise of return to investors. 32 Similar writings by the Education T esting Service ( America ' s Perfect Storm ) 33 and Thomas Friedman ( The World Is Flat ) 34 show that America must give greater emphasis to developing and retaining scientists, engineers, and science and technology educators. 24.4 The Science Curriculum Most countries have a national system of educa- tion and, hence, national curricula. In the United States, education is a responsibility of the state, and curricular decisions are made at the state, county, district, and school levels. The only nationwide science curricula in the United States are the College Board ' s Advanced Placement (AP) Program 35 and the International Baccalaureate (see sec-tion 24.5). Both sponsoring organizations pub-lish course outlines, test materials, and laboratory activities, and as a result, there is a high degree of standardization nationwide. 36 The Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate pro-grams are also offered at many international schools and are the most prominent models of internationally recognized science curricula. Although there is no national system of edu- cation in the United States, recommendations by national organizations, such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science, National Science T eachers Association, and National Research Council, have a profound infl uence on state and local curricular decisions. For exam-ple, after the National Commission on Excellence in Education ' s landmark Nation at Risk report in 1983, 37 schools and districts gave greater emphasis to science, and by the end of the decade, the number of graduating seniors who had taken science had increased as follows: biology, from 75 to 92 percent; chemistry, from 31 to 50 percent; and physics, from 14 to 22 percent. Although this represented a signif-icant increase in the amount of science instruction American students received, it was still signi - cantly less than in many countries, particularly with respect to the physical sciences. For example in the early 1990s, it was found that Chinese secondary students spent 140 percent as much instructional time in biology, 200 percent as much time in chem-istry, and 280 percent as much time in physics. 38 Figure 24.1 shows standard curricular sequences for American and Chinese high school students. Note that in grades 8, 10, 11, and 12, Chinese students receive 9 hours of science ins-truction, comprising 3 hours each of biology, chemistry, and physics. This same study observed that \" the Chinese science curriculum is uni-form, narrow, and deep, while the American cur-riculum is varied, broad, and fl at. The Chinese curriculum is vertical and spiral in nature \u2014 the same science concepts and skills appear again and again in the curricular materials at different levels c24.indd 502 c24.indd 502 5/9/08 6:19:27 PM 5/9/08 6:19:27 PMScience Curriculum and Instruction 503 of schooling, with greater knowledge and deeper understandings at the higher levels. \" 39 Comparisons with other developed nations have been similar, and the U.S. science and math curriculum has been described as \" a mile wide and an inch deep \" when compared to that of other developed nations. 40 Although AP and International Baccalaureate science curricula and assessments are accepted across the United States, no others are, and there is great variation from one school to the next among middle school, general program, college preparatory, and elective science courses. The sections that follow describe and list the titles of some of the more com-mon science courses taught in American schools. Middle and Junior High School Science Middle schools generally serve grades 6 to 8, while junior high schools serve grades 7 to 9. The courses offered are a function of the grades served: General Science: introduction to the life and physical sciences Earth Science: introduction to geology, hydrol- ogy, meteorology, and astronomy Life Science: introduction to biology, and to human anatomy and physiology \u007f \u007f\u007f Physical Science: introduction to chemistry and physics Integrated Science 1 and 2: all sciences are taught around unifying themes High School Science General Program General program courses may or may not have a laboratory component. They satisfy graduation requirements but are gen-erally not accepted as prerequisites for admission to four - year colleges and universities. Physical Science: introduction to physics and chemistry Life Science: introduction to biology Integrated Science Many integrated sci- ence courses were developed in response to the National Science T eachers Association ' s Scope Sequence and Coordination Project, with the goal of offering every student, every science, every year. Integrated science courses are often taught the-matically according to major unifying principles such as energy, matter, equilibrium, and change. Integrated Science 1,2,3,4: science based around common themes College Preparatory and Honors College preparatory sciences are laboratory - based courses that meet the entrance requirements at most col-leges and universities. 41 Honors or academically enriched classes are advanced versions of col-lege preparatory courses and may or may not receive an extra point when colleges are tabulating grade point averages for candidates for admission: Biology, Honors Biology: Traditional high school biology with lab Chemistry, Honors Chemistry: Traditional high school chemistry with lab Physics, Honors Physics: Traditional high school physics with lab Elective Sciences Many high schools offer elective sciences that allow students to pursue \u007f \u007f science biology chemistry physicsbiologylife science biology chemistry physics biology chemistry physics biology chemistry physics7 8 9 10 11 12ChinaUS 012345 89 67Grade level hours per week in class Figure 24.1 Comparisons of Chinese and American Curriculum for Teaching Science specialized interests.

These are labo-ratory sciences that meet the science prerequisites for admission to colleges and universities. Students may earn credit and advanced standing by per-forming high enough on a standardized exam. Many colleges award an extra grade point for A and B grades in AP courses that candidates for admission have taken: AP Biology AP Chemistry AP Physics B: Classical and modern physics (not calculus based) AP Physics C: Mechanics (calculus based) AP Physics C: Electromagnetism (calculus based) AP Environmental Science International Baccalaureate These courses are offered to high school juniors and seniors at participating schools.

In this section we briefl y describe the curricula. More information can be found online at sciencesource book.com and www.collegeboard.com , or search \" advanced placement. \" Advanced Placement Biology The AP Biology curriculum includes the following: Molecules and cells: chemistry of life, cells, cel- lular energetics Heredity and evolution: heredity, molecular genetics, evolutionary biology Organisms and populations: diversity of organ- isms, structure, and function of plants and animals, ecology 42 Recommended AP Biology laboratory activi- ties are published by the College Board. 43 The fol- lowing activities are commonly used in AP Biology classes: Diffusion and osmosis Enzyme catalysis Curriculum and Instruction 505 Cellular respiration Molecular biology Genetics of organisms Population genetics and evolution Transpiration Physiology of the circulatory system Animal behavior Dissolved oxygen and aquatic primary productivity Advanced Placement Chemistry The AP Chemistry curriculum includes the following: Structure of matter : atomic theory and struc- ture, chemical bonding, nuclear chemistry, nuclear equations, half - lives, radioactivity, chemical applications States of matter: gases, liquids, solids, solutions Reactions: reaction types, stoichiometry, equi- librium, kinetics, thermodynamics Descriptive chemistry Laboratory Problem solving: The AP Chemistry exam requires much problem solving, including problems dealing with percentage composi-tion, empirical and molecular formulas from experimental data, molar masses from gas density, freezing - point measurements, boil-ing - point measurements, gas laws, Dalton ' s law, Graham ' s law, stoichiometric relations, titration calculations, mole fractions, molar and molal solutions, Faraday ' s laws of electrolysis, equi-librium constants and their applications, stand-ard electrode potentials and their use, Nernst equation, thermodynamic and thermochemical calculations, and kinetics calculations. 44 Advanced Placement Physics B The AP Physics B curriculum covers topics in clas- sical and modern physics. It requires use of alge-bra and trigonometry but not calculus: Newtonian mechanics: kinematics, Newton ' s laws of motion, of \u007f \u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f \u007f \u007f Electricity and magnetism : electrostatics, con- ductors, capacitors, dielectrics, electric circuits, magnetic elds, electromagnetism Fluid mechanics and thermal physics: fl uid mechanics, temperature, heat, kinetic theory, thermodynamics Waves and optics: wave motion, sound, physi- cal optics, geometric optics Atomic and nuclear physics: atomic physics, quantum effects, nuclear physics 45 Advanced Placement Physics C The Physics C curriculum has two components: classical mechanics, and electricity and magne-tism. A student can take one or both exams. Physics C classes require use of calculus in prob-lem solving, derivations, and formulating prin-ciples. The curriculum is narrower than the curriculum of Physics B but requires greater ana-lytical and mathematical sophistication. Newtonian mechanics: kinematics, Newton ' s laws of motion, work, energy, power, sys-tems of particles, linear momentum, circular motion, rotation, oscillations, gravitation Electricity and magnetism: cir-cuits, magnetic elds, electromagnetism Advanced Placement Environmental Science The AP Environmental Science curriculum inclu- des the following: Earth systems and resources: Earth science con- cepts, atmosphere, global water resources and use, soil and soil dynamics The living world: ecosystem structure, energy fl ow, ecosystem diversity, natural ecosystem change, natural biogeochemical cycles Population: population biology Sourcebook Teaching Science Land and water use: agriculture, forestry, rangelands, other land use, mining, shing, global economics Energy resources and consumption: energy con- cepts, energy consumption, fossil fuel resources and use, nuclear energy, hydroelectric power, energy conservation, renewable energy Pollution: pollution types, impacts on the environment and human health, economic impacts Global change: stratospheric ozone, global warming, loss of biodiversity 46 International Baccalaureate A growing number of schools offer the International Baccalaureate (IB), an international curriculum and assessment program administered by the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO), headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland (see science sourcebook.com or www.ibo.org , or search \" interna- tional baccalaureate \" ). The IB program is taught in more than 120 countries and is particularly popu-lar at international schools such as those that serve the families of embassy workers and other expatri-ate professionals. Like the AP program, the IB offers yearly assessments in physics, chemistry, biology, and environmental systems. Many American col-leges offer credit for a performance of 5 or better on a scale of 1 to 7, although each college sets its own standards. The IB is a comprehensive curriculum designed to prepare students for liberal arts educa-tion at the tertiary level. The mission of the IBO is \" to develop inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect. \" 47 24.6 Teaching Science Inquiry T eaching and learning science through inquiry is one of the themes of this book. 48 Inquiry is advocated in the National Science Education Standards, 49 the Benchmarks for Science Literacy, 50 and the National Science T eachers Association. \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007f Think - Aloud Students learn how to reason by observing the reasoning of others. Think - aloud is a strategy in which the teacher makes thinking and reasoning processes explicit by describing the thought proc-esses involved. During think - alouds, teachers help students see the invisible processes of the mind by explaining what and how they are thinking. T eachers should describe how and when they are using the ve essential features of inquiry (22.1), aspects of the scienti c methods (5.4 - 5.10), and all of the other strategies introduced in preceding chapters. T eachers often want to prepare overhead transparencies or computer presentations showing how problems are solved. I strongly recommend against this as it makes the presentation \" canned \" and gives students a window only on the teacher ' s reading ability rather than his or her true thought process. I suggest starting with a blank transpar-ency or whiteboard when solving a problem and with only outline diagrams when describing ana-tomical or other structural features. Explain your logic as you solve problems and ll in details so students can learn from your thought processes. Scienti c Inquiry: A Position Statement of the National Science Teachers Association The National Science Education Standards (NSES) de nes scienti c inquiry as \" the diverse ways in which scientists study the natural world and pro-pose explanations based on the evidence derived from their work. Scienti c inquiry also refers to the activities through which students develop knowledge and understanding of scienti c ideas, as well as an understanding of how scientists study the natural world. \" 51 The Science as Inquiry Standard in NSES includes the abilities necessary to do scienti c inquiry and understanding about scienti c inquiry. Scienti c inquiry refl ects how scientists come to understand the natural world, and it is at the heart of how students learn. From a very early age, children interact with their environment, ask ques-tions, and seek ways to answer those questions. c24.indd 506 c24.indd 506 5/9/08 6:19:29 PM 5/9/08 6:19:29 PMScience and Instruction 507 Understanding science content is signi cantly enhanced when ideas are anchored to inquiry experiences. Scienti c inquiry is a powerful way of under- standing science content. Students learn how to ask questions and use evidence to answer them. In the process of learning the strategies of scienti c inquiry, students conduct an investigation and col-lect evidence from a variety of sources, develop an explanation from the data, and communicate and defend their conclusions. The National Science T eachers Association (NSTA) recommends that all K - 16 teachers embrace scienti c inquiry and is committed to helping educators make it the centerpiece of the science classroom. The use of scienti c inquiry will help ensure that students develop a deep understanding of science and scienti c inquiry. Regarding the use of scienti c inquiry as a teaching approach, NSTA recommends that sci-ence teachers: Plan an inquiry - based science program for their students by developing both short - and long - term goals that incorporate appropriate content knowledge. Implement approaches to teaching science that cause students to question and explore and to use those experiences to raise and answer questions about the natural world. The learning cycle approach is one of many effec-tive strategies for bringing explorations and questioning into the classroom. Guide and facilitate learning using inquiry by selecting teaching strategies that nurture and assess students ' developing understandings and abilities. Design and manage learning environments that provide students with the time, space, and resources needed for learning science through inquiry. Receive adequate administrative support for the pursuit of science as inquiry in the class-room. Support can take the form of profes-sional development on how to teach scienti c inquiry, content, and the nature of science; the allocation of time to do scienti c inquiry \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007f\u007feffectively; and the availability of necessary materials and equipment. Experience science as inquiry as part of their teacher preparation program. Preparation should include learning how to develop ques-tioning strategies, writing lesson plans that promote abilities and understanding of sci-enti c inquiry, and analyzing instructional materials to determine whether they promote scienti c inquiry. Regarding students ' abilities to do scienti c inquiry, NSTA recommends that teachers help students: Learn how to identify and ask appropriate questions that can be answered through scien-ti c investigations. Design and conduct investigations to collect the evidence needed to answer a variety of questions. Use appropriate equipment and tools to inter-pret and analyze data. Learn how to draw conclusions and think critically and logically to create explanations based on their evidence. Communicate and defend their results to their peers and others. Regarding students ' understanding about sci- enti c inquiry, NSTA recommends that teachers help students understand: That science involves asking questions about the world and then developing scienti c inves- tigations to answer their questions. That there is no xed sequence of steps that all scienti c investigations follow. Different kinds of questions suggest different kinds of scien-ti c investigations. That scienti c inquiry is central to the learn- ing of science and refl ects how science is done. The importance of gathering empirical data using appropriate tools and instruments. That the evidence they collect can change their perceptions about the world and increase their scienti The Sourcebook for Teaching Science The importance of being skeptical when they assess their own work and the work of others. That the scienti c community seeks explana- tions that are empirically based and logically consistent. 24.7 Teaching Science to English Language Learners In 2003, 42 percent of American public school students were of racial or ethnic minorities, up 22 percent from 30 years before. 52 Most of this increase in diversity was due to immigration from Latin America and Asia, and with this increase in ethnic diversity came a corresponding increase in linguistic diversity. For example, in 2002, nearly 42 percent of students in Los Angeles Uni ed School District, the second largest district in the country, were classi ed as English language learners. The Institute of Education Sciences of the U.S. Department of Education de nes English language learners (ELL) as individuals who (1) were not born in the United States or whose native language is a language other than English; or (2) come from environments where a language other than English is dominant; or (3) are American Indians and Alaskan Natives and who come from environments where a language other than English has had a signi cant impact on their level of English pro ciency; and who, by reason thereof, have suf cient dif culty speak- ing, reading, writing, or understanding the English language, to deny such individuals the opportunity to learn successfully in classrooms where the language of instruction is English or to participate fully in our society. 53 T oday ' s science teachers must be prepared to teach students whose rst language is not English. In this section we reference ELL strategies and activities that are found throughout this book. The science classroom is often a frustrating place for English language learners. Science has \u007f \u007fa complex vocabulary that is dif cult even for native English speakers to learn. Dif culty learning English should not be confused with an inability to think scienti cally. Many of the strategies that are useful for English language learners are effective for differentiating instruction for other students as well. Use a variety of methods to see which work best with your teaching style and students. Listening Speak slowly and distinctly, and write down key terms. Anyone who has learned a foreign lan- guage in class, then traveled to a country where the language is spoken, has noticed that it is dif cult to understand natives because they seem to \" talk too fast. \" What seems normal speed to a native speaker is extremely fast to a language learner or a student with a hearing impairment. The addition of the complex terms and concepts of science can make learning even more dif cult. Write down key terms so students can see them and connect them to the spoken word. Closed captioning. Most science videos are equipped with closed captioning. Turn on the closed captioning so students can see what nar-rators and actors are saying (Activity 16.5.4). This helps English language learners correlate written and spoken English and helps them see spelling and sentence construction. Closed captioning is also invaluable for the hearing impaired. Visualization Emphasize visual literacy. It is often said that math and music are universal languages \u2014 ones that can be read regardless of one ' s primary lan-guage. Although these claims are debatable, it is clear that an English - speaking student can read and understand an equation in a Swahili textbook and a Greek musician can play a score drafted by a Japanese composer. Regardless of linguistic background, people around the world can inter-pret mathematical equations and musical scores. In addition, they can also interpret pictures and, with minimal linguistic skills, interpret charts and graphs. Visual literacy, or the ability to evaluate, \u007f \u007f PMScience Curriculum and Instruction 509 apply, or create conceptual visual representation, is relatively independent of language and is therefore invaluable to learning science and English simulta-neously. Vector diagrams (16.1), scienti c diagrams (16.2), pictorial riddles (16.3), photographic analy-sis (16.4), movie analysis (16.5), and map develop-ment and analysis (21.1 - 21.7) are a few of the many activities that can be used to build visual literacy. Graphic organizers. Graphic organizers are a means of introducing and assessing concepts in a manner that encourages meaningful learning. They are diagrams or maps that show the relation-ship between new and existing concepts, thereby facilitating integration of new and familiar ideas. They require minimal language and are helpful tools when teaching science to English language learners. Conceptual grids (9.1), Venn diagrams (9.2), fl owcharts (9.3), mind maps (9.4), and con- cept maps (9.5) are some of the more common graphic organizers. Use charts, graphs and gures. Scatter and line graphs (20.4), column and bar charts (20.5), pie and area graphs (20.5), and high - low, com-bination and log plots (20.7) can communicate concepts with minimal use of spoken or written language. The layout of such visual aids should be clear and uncluttered. Manual video control. Science videos often introduce a variety of new terms and concepts, most of which even native speakers have dif culty remembering. Pause the video to discuss key con-cepts. Use the bookmark and video clip features to return to precise sequences for review (Activity 16.5.4). Use the step - frame, slow motion, and replay features to focus student attention on key concepts. Interpersonal Strategies Group projects and cooperative learning. Many of the activities in this book employ group work and cooperative learning. Such activities provide opportunities for students to exchange, write, and present ideas. Projects use a variety of skills that work together to increase understanding and retention. Partner English learners with strong English speakers. The best way to learn something is to \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007fteach English speakers bene ts both students. It may be particularly bene cial to pair English learners with bilingual students who can translate laboratory and activity procedures. Develop a seating chart so English language learners are sitting near the front of class and adjacent to bilingual students who can assist them. Think/pair/share. Students learn to speak English by speaking English, but it is often coun-terproductive to ask English language learners to read passages or give descriptions to the entire class. Students are often embarrassed by their minimal science knowledge and English skills, and public exposure may make them more uncomfort-able and reserved. By contrast, English language learners are often eager to share their ideas in their new language with their peers. The think/pair/share strategy gives all students the opportunity to practice English by explaining science concepts. 54 Provide students with time to write a response to a thought - provoking question, then additional time to discuss it with their neighbor before shar-ing their conclusion with the class. The think/pair/share technique increases student participa-tion and involvement and is a particularly effective way of encouraging English language learners to express science concepts in English. Encourage participation. Many English learn- ers come from countries in which student partici-pation is not encouraged. They may be reluctant to speak, not only because of their lack of pro ciency in English, but also because they are uncomfort-able in an environment where they are asked to share their ideas. A positive and supportive envi-ronment has a signi cant infl uence on student comfort level, participation, and success. Requiring English language learners to speak in front of class may be counterproductive and cause great anxiety. Encourage them to express themselves, but don ' t force them onto the stage prematurely. Structure Consistent routines: English learners are freer to concentrate on new concepts if they are familiar with classroom routines. \u007f \u007f Sourcebook Road map to science: English language learners bene t greatly from a \" road map \" that shows where they are in the science curriculum. Use organizational structures when teaching earth and space science (8.2), biology (8.3), chemistry (8.4), or physics (8.5) to English language learners. Outlines: Provide students with a copy of your lecture or discussion outline. This will help ELL students know where you are and where you are going with your lesson. Relate to prior knowledge: Make use of stu- dent background knowledge of science concepts. Discover what your students already know about a given topic, and build on this knowledge. Laboratory Hand - on activities: Kinesthetic learning events provide an excellent learning environment for English language learners. The books I coauthored with James Cunningham, Hands - On Chemistry Activities with Real - Life Applications, and Hands - On Physics Activities with Real - Life Applications, provide numerous hands - on activities of bene t for English language learners. Demonstrations Clear, procedural steps: The science laboratory can be a confusing and potentially dangerous setting for English language learners. Present procedures clearly using fl owcharts, pictures, and outlines. Model laboratory activities: Demonstrate activities in front of the class to ensure that English language learners can see the procedures before engaging in an activity. Pictorial guide: Provide a visual reference to glassware and other materials used in experiments and activities. Review safety symbols, and post them in the room and in the lab handout. Reading and Writing Journaling: Students become better writers by writing. Require English language learn-ers to keep science journals (Activity 3.2.1) in which they write lecture notes, new terms, and responses to prompts. \u007f \u007f Cloze (2.1) and jigsaw (2.2) are two techniques for developing and assessing reading comprehension and can be used when making formative assess-ments of language and science learning. Instruction Wait time: T eachers are often uncomfortable with silence and either call on the rst student to raise a hand or answer questions themselves, thereby short - circuiting the thought processes of most stu-dents, particularly English language learners who are trying to translate terms while formulating an explanation. Let students know that you expect all to be mentally engaged, and for this reason you pro-vide wait time suf cient for the majority to develop an answer before calling on any individual. Analogies: Use analogies to relate new con- cepts to previously learned concepts (10.2 - 10.5). Vocabulary Language - based science games: Reinforce vocab- ulary with Science Bingo (13.3) and concepts with Science Pictionary (13.4). These games require mini-mal spoken language and provide an excellent review of science vocabulary. Picture glossary: One of the best ways to learn the vocabulary of a new language is with pictorial fl ash cards. A picture of the concept is on one side, and the term (in the language to be learned) is on the reverse. The student learns to correlate con-cepts directly with words, eliminating the need for translation. Common lexicon: People construct under- standing by integrating new ideas with preexisting knowledge. Ask students what they already know; then develop a common classroom vocabulary that can be used to develop new understandings. Root words: A knowledge of Greek and Latin pre xes, suf xes, and roots can greatly enhance student understanding of scienti c terms and facil- itate a better understanding of English and other European languages. Approximately 50 percent of all words in English have Latin roots, many of which are shared with Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Italian. Learning scienti c PMScience Curriculum and Instruction 511 helps one understand the vocabulary of a variety of languages, particularly English (1.1 - 1.4). Cognates: Many science terms are used inter- nationally. Identify such terms (2.3, 2.4), and ask your students to notify you whenever they rec-ognize a new term that is pronounced or written similarly in their rst language. This helps build your knowledge of cognates (words that are simi-lar in two or more languages) so you can help future learners master science vocabulary. Mathematics translation: English language learners nd word problems much more challeng- ing than symbolic math problems. The English language is exceedingly complex, with numerous nuances that must be learned. Students need to be able to translate common words to math symbols (14.1), natural language to algebraic expressions (14.2), and algebraic expressions to natural lan-guage (14.3). The activities in this book help stu-dents develop such skills. Word wall: Post new vocabulary terms on the wall in an organized, grouped manner. For example, you may wish to post new biology terms in columns according to the level of organization (e.g., cell, tissue, organ) (8.3). 24.8 Teaching Science with Humor A good sense of humor can help create a posi- tive learning environment and reduce the tension that makes many students dislike school. Humor should be clean, respectful, and related to the cur-riculum. Each teacher needs to develop his or her own style of humor, but it helps to have some ideas to work with. This section provides a few samples of science humor that may add a little lev-ity to your classroom. Puns A pun is a gure of speech that consists of a delib- erate confusion of similar words or phrases. Here are a few examples: Absolute zero is cool! The speed of time is 1 second per second. \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007f \u007f The unit on optics requires some light reading. Free radicals have revolutionized chemistry. If you chop an avocado into 6.02 /H11003 10 23 pieces, you get guacamole. The chemical company became insolvent after spilling benzene in the river. The microbiologist was crushed by the cover slip. During nucleotides, biochemicals wash up onto the beach. A person who is ambidextrose can eat L - glucose or D - glucose. Biology grows on you. Seismologists are fault nders. Geologists have their faults Geologists are gneiss, don ' t take things for granite, and have a good apatite. Excellent vulcanology students graduate magma cum laude. Geologists never lose their luster. Geologists don ' t wrinkle; they show lineation. When a bridge collapses in California, it is the San Andreas Fault! Do molecular biologists wear designer genes? Geology rocks! 10 12 microphones /H11005 1 megaphone. 10 6 bicycles /H11005 2 megacycles. 454 graham crackers /H11005 1 pound cake. 10 millipedes /H11005 1 centipede. 10 monologs /H11005 5 dialogues. 2 monograms /H11005 1 diagram. 8 nickels /H11005 2 paradigms. Visual puns: Some puns can be displayed diagrammatically such as the \" chemicals \" in Figure 24.2 . Imponderable Questions The term imponderable was popularized by David Feldman, author of a series of books that examine, investigate, and explain puzzling phenomena. 55 Many imponderables are humorous and can be used as warm - up activities, or simply to add levity to the classroom. Here are a few \" imponderable \" questions: Why does the Department of The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Why do scientists call it \" research \" when look- ing for something new? Why does the number of cells multiply when cells divide? Have you ever imagined a world with no hypothetical situations? How does T efl on stick to a pan? If it ' s zero degrees outside today and it ' s sup-posed to be twice as cold tomorrow, how cold is it going to be? What ' s the speed of dark? Why is it called \" after dark \" when it really is \" after light \" ? If something doesn ' t matter, does it have no mass? If sound does not travel in a vacuum, why is a vacuum so noisy? When do sh sleep? How do they keep soda in soft drink machines from freezing in winter? Why don ' t lizards get sunburned? Why do bottled water containers have expira-tion dates? Do identical twins have identical ngerprints? How do birds know where to peck for worms? Science Songs Students who have great dif culty memorizing science facts may be able to memorize lengthy song lyrics with little dif culty. The rhythm, rhyme, and melody of songs make it easy to remember the lyrics. Certain performers, like J.P . Taylor and the Academics, have capitalized on this fact and have written songs to help stu-dents memorize science facts and concepts. The Academics have written songs such as \" The Rock Cycle \" (on the formation The Rain Forest Song \" (on the ecology and value of the rain forest), and \" Get Y our Molecules Movin \" (on conduction, con-vection, and radiation). \" The Elements Song, \" writ-ten and sung by T om Lehrer in 1959, has been used for years to introduce students to the periodic table. These and other science songs can be acquired from iTunes and other Internet music stores. T o capital-ize on musical intelligence (24.2), have your stu-dents write and sing songs on science topics such as the solar system, mitosis, or chemical reactions. Science Celebrations Some science teachers have found celebrations to be good tools for engaging students and set-ting the tone of the class. Classes can celebrate the birthdays of scientists, famous days in science, and other notable days. Two of the most commonly celebrated days are Mole Day and Pi Day . Mole Day is celebrated in chemistry classes on October 23 between 6:02 a.m. and 6:02 p.m. , making the date 6:02 10/23 (American style of writing dates). The time and date refl ect Avogadro ' s number which rep- resents the number of atoms or molecules in a mole, the SI unit for measuring quantity. Classes can celebrate in a variety of ways, many of which are listed on Mole Day Web sites. Pi Day is celebrated in mathematics and physics classes in recognition of the irrational number pi ( /H9266 ), the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle. The value of /H9266 is approxi- mately 3.14159, so classes celebrate on March 14 (3/14 U.S. date format) at 1:59 p.m. Classes can celebrate in a variety of ways, many of which are listed on Internet Pi Day Web sites. \u007f 512 5/9/08 6:19:32 PM 5/9/08 6:19:32 PMScience Curriculum and Instruction 513 Scientists ' birthdays. Classes may celebrate scientists ' birthdays to refl ect their contribu- tions to science and society. The following is a month - by - month starter list. The birthdays of many scientists can be found using an online encyclopedia such as Wikipedia ( www.wikipedia.org ): January 4, 1643: Isaac Newton \u2014 mechanics, gravity, calculus February 8, 1834: Dimitri Mendeleyev \u2014 periodic table March 14, 1879: Albert Einstein \u2014 relativity, mass energy equivalence April 21, 1838: John Muir \u2014 ecology, con-servation, preservation May 27, 1907: Rachel Carson \u2014 environ-mental movement June 13, 1831: James Clerk Maxwell \u2014 electromagnetism July 10, 1856: Nikola T esla \u2014 alternating current August 30, 1871: Ernest Rutherford \u2014 nuclear physics September 22, 1791: Michael Faraday \u2014 electrochemistry October 5, 1882: Robert Goddard \u2014 rocket propulsion November 7, 1867: Marie Curie \u2014 radio -activity December 27, 1822: Louis Pasteur \u2014 micro-biology Science Comics A variety of cartoonists make humorous com- ics pertaining to topics in science. Perhaps the most famous is Gary Larson, whose syndicated \" Far Side \" cartoons often have a scienti c theme. Larson ' s single - framed cartoons are humorous because of their anthropomorphic portrayal of plants, animals, protozoans, fungi, and bacteria. Science Spoofs A spoof is a humorous story, parody, or satire. One of the most famous science spoofs is the work of Nathan Zohner, a student at Eagle Rock Junior \u007f \u007f \u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007fHigh School in Idaho Falls, Idaho. Zohner ' s science fair project, entitled \" How Gullible Are We? \" exam-ined the response of his fellow students to a \" peti-tion \" to ban dihydrogen monoxide (DHMO). Zohner wrote a \" petition \" stating the dangers of DHMO in such a way that most readers thought it was a dangerous product of an industrial lab rather than what it really is, water (H 2 O). Soon Zohner ' s petition was posted on the Internet and e - mailed around the world. Zohner ' s petition begins: \" Dihydrogen monoxide is colorless, odorless, taste-less, and kills uncounted thousands of people every year. Most of these deaths are caused by accidental inhalation of DHMO, but the dangers of dihydro-gen monoxide do not end there. Prolonged expo-sure to its solid form causes severe tissue damage. Symptoms of DHMO ingestion can include exces-sive sweating and urination, and possibly a bloated feeling, nausea, vomiting and body electrolyte imbalance. For those who have become depend-ent, DHMO withdrawal means certain death. \" 56 Each of these statements is true but phrased so those reading the petition do not recognize that it is about water (DHMO /H11005 H 2 O). Y ou may wish to nd the original petition on the Internet and use it for a lesson in gullibility (see sciencesourcebook. com , or search \" ban DHMO \" ). 24.9 Professional Development in Science Education Professional Organizations and Journals A profession is an occupation that requires exten- sive study and training and mastery of a special-ized body of knowledge. Professions are governed and represented by professional associations, have an ethical code, and have a process of licensing or certi cation. T eaching is a profession. Table 24.1 lists professional organizations and journals for science teachers. Science teachers can keep cur-rent of recent developments by attending local and national conferences and reading professional journals. c24.indd 513 c24.indd 513 5/9/08 6:19:33 PM 5/9/08 6:19:33 PM514 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science Table 24.1 Science Organizations and Their Journals Organization Journals American Association of Physics Teachers www.aapt.orgAmerican Physics Teacher: Research, applied physics, curricu- lum, pedagogy, lab equipment, book reviews American Journal of Physics: Physics, culture, education Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education www.aace.orgJournal of Computers in Mathematics and Science Teaching: Information technology in the teaching of mathematics and science American Chemical Society www.acs.orgJournal of Chemical Education: Resources to improve college and high school chemistry education (jchemed.chem.wisc.edu) American Physiological Society www.the-aps.orgAdvances in Physiology Education: Teaching and learning of physiology (advan.physiology.org) National Association of Biology Teachers www.nabt.orgAmerican Biology Teacher: Pedagogy, demonstrations, experiments, and resources in biology education National Association of Geoscience Teachers www.nagt.orgJournal of Geoscience Education: Pedagogy, assessment, and philosophy of teaching and learning about the geosciences National Earth Science Teachers Association www.nestanet.orgEarth Scientist: Teaching of geology, astronomy, physical geog- raphy, and environmental sciences National Association for Research in Science Teaching www.narst.orgJournal of Research in Science Teaching: Issues of science teaching and learning, science education policy National Science Teachers Association www.nsta.orgScience and Children: Elementary school science Science Scope: Middle school science Science Teacher: Middle and high school science Journal of College Science Teaching: College science School Science and Mathematics Association www.ssma.orgSchool Science and Mathematics: Issues, concerns, and lessons within and between science and mathematics Professional Development Many school districts and organizations offer professional development workshops for science teachers. Such workshops are designed to expand the pedagogical content knowledge of participat-ing faculty. One way that this is accomplished is by giving teachers the opportunity to participate in lessons as adult learners. T eachers and facilitators start a workshop lesson in \" teacher mode, \" discuss-ing the purpose and pedagogy of the training. They then enter \" student mode, \" where they practice the lesson as adult learners, performing the same activities required of secondary school students, but responding to questions and prompts with the full knowledge of adult professionals. After the \" student session \" is completed, the training moves again to the \" teacher mode \" where all refl ect on the lesson and offer suggestions for improvement. 57 Lesson Study A related approach to professional development is known as Lesson Study, a process in which teachers work together to plan, observe, analyze, and re ne actual classroom lessons. 58 L e s s o n Study is used widely in Japan, and many credit and Instruction 515 it for improvements in Japanese mathematics and science instruction. In lesson study, teachers work together to (1) establish long - term goals of instruction, (2) consider goals of a particular subject, unit, or lesson, (3) plan classroom research lessons that operationalize long term and speci c subject - matter goals, and (4) study how students respond to these lessons. National Board Certi cation The National Board for Professional T eaching Standards (NBTPS) was created in 1987 after the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy ' s Task Force on T eaching as a Profession released A Nation Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Century. 59 The NBTPS is an independent, nonpro t, non- governmental organization designed to advance the quality of teaching by developing professional standards for accomplished teaching. It has cre-ated a voluntary system to certify teachers who meet these standards. More information about national board certi cation can be found on the Internet at sciencesourcebook.com or www.nbtps. org , or search \" national board certi cation nbtps. \" 24.10 Science Field Trips and Guest Speakers Students bene t from a variety of teachers, both formal and informal. Variety provides new per-spectives and ideas and opens minds to new goals and careers. T eachers can provide such variety by taking students on eld trips, where they learn from displays, docents, and real - world examples, and by inviting guest speakers who provide exper-tise from research and industry. Science Field Trips Although science studies the real world, many students study it only vicariously through books, lectures, and videos. T o gain a deeper appreciation for science, students should be exposed to the real thing. We may talk about constellations and galax-ies, but if students have never seen the Milky Way, it is dif cult for them to relate to lectures on the stars. We can talk about biomes and ecosystems, but if they have never been out of the city, such talk may seem irrelevant. Field trips are an excellent way to connect stu- dents with true subject matter \u2014 the real world. Students should always be provided with a printed eld trip guide to help them understand what they are seeing and to make them accountable for learning. T eachers should provide activi-ties for students to do while on the trip, such as gathering data, collecting samples, making obser-vations, answering questions, taking photographs, recording coordinates, or writing reports. Table 24.2 lists possible eld trip destinations. Look online for the eld trip sites closest to your school (look on sciencesourcebook.com or search by destination). Guest Speakers The best source of guest speakers for your science classroom may be the parents of your students. If possible, determine the occupations of your stu-dents ' parents through a questionnaire, the parent teacher association, or back - to - school night. Tables 4.2 to 4.5 list hundreds of occupations related to science. Parents who work in any of these elds may be able to provide presentations on their pro-fessions to your class. Such presentations build bridges between industry and education, and they may open the eyes of students to career possibili-ties and help them see how to prepare academi-cally. In addition, you may wish to inquire at the speakers ' bureaus of local industries and agencies, a few of which are listed below. Government agencies: sh and game, waste management, air resources Colleges: professors, public lecture series, edu- cational outreach, recruitment Professional societies: American Chemical Society, American Physical Society Health societies: Cancer Society, Diabetes Asso- ciation, Heart Association Special interest groups: Audubon Society, Nature Club Sourcebook for Teaching Science The WebQuest home page might provide links to archived ozone and particulate maps, current pollution indexes, the National Weather Service, local newspapers, and municipal webcams. Web-Quests can be located by searching for the subject of interest and the term \" WebQuest. \" Table 24.2 Science Field Trip Ideas Museums aeronautics museumsautomotive museumsinvention museumsnatural tide poolswetlandswilderness research stations federal research stationslaunch research stationsmountain research stations NASA aquariumsnature centersplanetariumszoos aqueductsairportsbiotechnology plantswind farms WebQuests WebQuests are inquiry oriented Internet - based activities. 60 Students solve problems and answer questions using data from the Web.

Although similar information can be found in many teacher education books, the ideas and infor-mation here are designed with science teachers in mind. I encourage you to browse these resources and adopt and adapt those you nd useful. 25.1 Establishing Science Learning Objectives Science teachers should write learning objectives that communicate and describe intended learning outcomes. 1 Objectives should be stated in terms of what the student will be able to do when the les-son is completed. Objectives should include verbs, such as those listed in Table 25.1 , to de ne speci c, observable, and measurable student behavior. 2 A learning objective contains (1) a statement of what students will be able to do when a lesson is completed, (2) the conditions under which the stu-dents will be able to perform the task, and (3) the criteria for evaluating student performance. While goals describe global learning outcomes, learning objectives are statements of speci c performances that contribute to the attainment of goals. Learning objectives should help guide curriculum develop-ment, instructional strategies, selection of instruc-tional materials, and development of assessments. 25.2 Developing a Science Lesson Plan Dwight Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe and thirty - fourth president c25.indd 517 c25.indd 517 5/9/08 5:26:51 PM 5/9/08 Sourcebook for Teaching Science Table 25.1 Verbs for Use in Writing Learning Objectives Knowledge Comprehension Application Analysis Synthesis Evaluation cite collect copy de ne describe duplicate enumerate identify label list match memorize name order quote recall recognize record recount relate repeat reproduce show specify state tabulate tell when what where who associate classify convert describe differentiate discuss distinguish estimate explain express extend group identify indicate order paraphrase predict report restate retell review select summarize translate understand administer apply calculate change chart choose collect compute construct demonstrate determine develop discover employ establish examine exhibit illustrate interview manipulate modify operate practice predicts prepare produce relate report schedule show sketch solve transfer use analyze arrange breakdown categorize classify compare connect contrast correlate detect diagram differentiate discriminate dissect distinguish divide examine experiment group identify illustrate inspect interpret investigate order organize outline probe question relate select separate survey test adapt assemble collaborate combine compile compose concoct construct contrive create design develop devise formulate generalize generate hypothesize imagine incorporate integrate invent modify organize originate plan predict produce propose reconstruct reorganize revise speculate systematize appraise argue assess conclude convince criticize decide deduce defend determine discriminate infer interpret judge justify persuade prioritize rate rank recommend relate revise score support value validate of the United States, said, \" In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable. \" Eisenhower knew that it was essential to plan yet remain fl exible. Planning helps teachers be more fl exible as they become acquainted with various options. Lesson planning is a critical part of every teacher ' s work, but it is important to be fl exible to accommodate the real and immediate needs of students. Just as there is no single scienti c method, so there is no single way of planning lessons. 3 In general, however, les- sons should include objectives, standards, anticipa- tory sets, teaching, guided practice (input, modeling, check of understanding), closure, and independent practice. 4 Table 25.2 lists factors to consider when planning a lesson. Managing Science Instruction 519 25.3 Developing a Science Semester Plan It is essential that every science teacher develop a long - term plan. Such plans help pace instruc-tion to ensure suf cient time for key concepts, activities, and assessments. It is helpful to develop a semester plan using a grid such as shown in Table 25.3 . Each column represents a week or other unit of time, and each row represents an ele-ment in the teaching plan. This format makes it very easy to see the semester at a glance. 25.4 Getting to Know Your Students The classroom should be an environment charac- terized by respect \u2014 respect for the mission of the school, respect for the teac her, respect for the staff and administration, respect for school and per-sonal property, respect for the taxpayers or par-ents who are paying the bills, and respect for one another. T o establish an environment of respect, teachers should practice the Golden Rule: \" Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. \" Table 25.2 Elements of a Lesson Plan Goals and Objectives (before class) Goals and learning objectives Concepts and content standards Preparation (before class) Equipment and supplies Prior knowledge students must have Lesson introduction (in class) Anticipatory set a Purpose or objective of lesson Relationship to previous lessons and standards Lesson (in class) Spoken and Written lecture notes discussion handouts worksheets text references Graphics diagrams video clips digital photos bulletin board transparencies Activities demonstrations experiments projects eld trip guest speakers Guided Practice (in class) Worksheets Activities Closure (in class) b Summary Assessment of learning Independent Practice: Homework (at home) Readings Questions and problems a The purpose of an anticipatory set is to focus the attention of all learners on the lesson. Counterintuitive demonstrations, stories, news items, anecdotes, and dispatch activities are among the many things that can be used as an anticipatory set to \" make sure everyone is on the train before it leaves the station. \" b Closure involves the completion of a daily or unit lesson. It summarizes the lesson, relates the les- son to the objectives, and assesses understanding. Closure is facilitated by the teacher but should be an act of the learner. c25.indd 519 c25.indd 519 5/9/08 5:26:53 PM Sourcebook for Teaching Science T eachers who demonstrate respect for students, the school, the administration, and their colleagues are more likely to have respectful classroom envi-ronments. T eachers demonstrate respect for their students when they express a genuine interest in them as individuals. The following strategies provide opportunities for the teacher to do this by learning the names, backgrounds, ideas, interests, and aspirations of their students. Showing interest in your students demonstrates your respect for them and helps build rapport, making the classroom a more pleas- ant place for all. Learning Student Names: Tips and Techniques It is a formidable task to learn the names of 150 to 200 students, but it is easier if you can associ-ate them with a photograph, activity, event, inter-est, or hobby. The more you know about your students, the easier it is to remember their names.

Use multiple techniques in different contexts to promote long - term mem-ory of student names: Yearbook photos. Match last year ' s yearbook photographs with the names of the students on your roster. Learn as many student names as possible prior to the rst day of class, and surprise your students by greeting them by name when you meet them. Photographic seating chart. Use seating chart software to position individual student photo-graphs in a fl exible grid that can be rearranged as needed. Alternatively, you may take a photo-graph of your classroom with students in their assigned seats. Leave a photographic seating chart in your desk or on your computer, where it may be accessed by a substitute teacher. Class photograph. Take a digital photograph of your class, print it out, and pass it around, ask-ing students to write their names under their photos. Name cards. Ask your students to write their names on a folded sheet of card stock in large enough letters that everyone can read them. Students should place their name cards on their desks or above their lab stations. Paper distribution. Match student names with faces as you hand back student work. Save those you don ' t know for last, and use the process of elimination to match student names with faces. Calling on students by name. Call on students by name, and refer to their ideas and contributions by the name of student who provided them. Student introductions. Instruct your students to ask a series of questions of their neighbors and then introduce them to the class using what they have learned. Greeting students at the door. Greet your students by name at the door as they enter. This helps you memorize their names and helps establish rapport and accountability. Write personalized responses. Address students by name when writing comments on their papers. Learning Who Your Students Are: Questionnaires Questionnaires are a valuable tool to learn about the students in your classes. They should be voluntary, approved by an administrator, and collected early in the rst week of class. Study each questionnaire, associating personal information with student pic-tures from your photographic seating chart. Following are sample questions.

There are numerous ice-breakers, but the following are particularly helpful in getting to know students. Commonalities Provide students with a 3 \" by 5 \" note card, and instruct them to write their name on the front. They should then fl ip the card and write things that they share in common with others in the class as follows: (a) true of all, (b) true of most, (c) true of about half, (d) true of a few, (e) true of only themselves. The teacher selects cards at random and reads a statement. All students for whom the statement is true should stand and remain standing until a statement is read that does not describe them. People Bingo Give each student a \" people bingo \" card with questions such as those shown in Figure 25.1 . Give students 5 minutes to collect the initials of others in the class for which each statement is true. Each person can sign a card only once. The winners are the rst ve to get a Bingo ( ve initials in a column, row, or diagonal). If questions are selected well, they can serve as segues to science lessons. For example, the broccoli question raises a number of interesting questions concerning chemistry, genetics, and perception. Why do some people like broccoli, while others hate it? Scientists now believe that certain tastes are not acquired but genetic. T eachers can illustrate this by distributing phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) paper, easily available from scienti c supply com- panies. Some students nd PTC extremely distaste- ful, while others don ' t taste a thing. Geneticists have identi ed the TAS2R38 gene as responsible for the ability to taste bitter chemicals similar to PTC. 5 25.5 Managing the Classroom Effectively Classroom management is a term teachers use to describe techniques and strategies employed to ensure that classroom lectures, discussions, activi-ties, and experiments are conducted ef ciently and effectively. Classroom management involves plan-ning and implementation of lessons, as well as strategies to engage and manage students. Student misbehavior is a threat to any classroom, and teachers need to develop a workable approach to discipline that is consistent with school policy and appropriate for their students. Classroom management is best established when there is an environment of respect and rapport.

Here are some tips to establish respect and rapport in the classroom. Communicate and Enforce Policies School policies: Make certain that you sup- port and enforce school and district policies. Undermining the authority of the administra-tion gives students license to undermine your authority. Behavior standards: Develop and communicate a clear and simple set of behavior standards. Long lists invite confusion and loopholes. Do not establish policies that you are unwilling or unable to enforce. Build a Respectful Environment Respect: Students learn respect from teachers who demonstrate respect for students, col-leagues, administrators, parents, education, and the school. T eachers should avoid threats, bribery, sarcasm, and similar control mecha-nisms. Such shortsighted techniques may produce immediate compliance but foment long - term anger and disrespect. Honesty: Admit when you don ' t know some- thing, and use it is an opportunity to illustrate your desire to learn. Apologize if you have said or done something rude or hurtful. Set the standard of honesty that you want your stu-dents to follow. Be rm, fair, and consistent: Enforce policies rmly, fairly, and consistently. Partiality breeds contempt. Students should never be able to identify a teacher ' s pet. Establish Rapport Know your students: Illustrate your interest in students by engaging them in classroom dis-cussion and talking with them outside class. It is valuable to attend school plays, sporting events, social gatherings, and other extracur-ricular activities to learn about your students and demonstrate that you are interested in them as individuals. It is helpful to conduct a student survey at the beginning of the semester to gather information and learn about your students. Concern for students: Demonstrate that you teach students, not material. Model the type of concern you want your students to show to one another. Humor: Maintain a good sense of humor. Laugh with your students but never at them. Humor can defuse many problems, but sar-casm and offensive statements will harm your relationship with your class. Establish Goals and Expectations Syllabus: A syllabus describes the course con- tent, calendar, grading standards, and behav-ior standards. Students and parents should sign a form indicating that they have read and understand the syllabus. High expectations: Maintain high expectations for yourself as a teacher and lifelong learner. Y ou cannot expect students to have high expec-tations as learners if they perceive that you have low goals as a teacher. Maintain high but appropriate expectations for your students. 6 Work toward developing an atmosphere of personal accountability. Enthusiasm for learning: Demonstrate an enthu- siasm for the subject you teach and for learning in general. Assignment sheets: Students should have access to their assignments and grades at any time. Such information can be provided through the Internet or through assignment sheets such as shown in Figure 25.2 . The student completes the form and calculates his or her cumulative total and percent as illustrated. Objectives and standards: Display your objec- tives and content standards at the beginning of each session, referring to them as the lesson progresses. Show how the content relates to prior lessons. Plan and Deliver Overplan: Plan more activities than you think you will have time for, but prioritize them so you cover the most important ones rst. Idle time is the source of many behavior problems. c25.indd 523 c25.indd 523 5/9/08 5:26:55 PM 5/9/08 Teaching Science Use time ef ciently: Students are in school to learn. Respect their time. Don ' t shortchange them by poor time management. Make content relevant: Students are more likely to buy into your educational goals if they see how the subject matter relates to everyday life. Avoid busywork: Assignments should be designed to further understanding, not occupy student time. Don ' t waste valuable student time by meaningless busywork. Use your voice wisely: Modulate your voice to provide emphasis and interest. Do not raise your voice to be heard over students. If you do, students may raise their voices to be heard over you! Consider using a wireless microphone so you can be heard without raising or strain-ing your voice. Engage students: Students who are engaged learn. The best way to engage students is through interesting, relevant, and signi cant activities. One way to keep students on their toes is to call on them randomly. Put student names on craft sticks (popsicle sticks) or cards and pull the cards from a jar at random. Monitor Student Behavior Proximity: Move around the classroom to main- tain proximity to all students. Students are more likely to stay on task when the teacher is close by. Maintain eye contact: Eye contact communicates concern, awareness, and accountability. Greet your students by name as they enter the class. This af rms your interest in them and helps them know they will be accountable for their behavior. Catch students doing something right: Reward good behavior. Figure 25.3 illustrates an extra - credit note that can be issued to students who are \" caught doing something right. \" Extra - credit points boost student morale and can help improve the classroom climate. Students keep their extra - credit points until the end of a grading period, when they sign them and turn them in to the teacher. Maintain an Optimal Learning Environment Ventilation and temperature: Make certain room temperatures are appropriate and venti-lation is adequate. Warm, stuffy air may con-tribute to sleepiness, particularly after lunch. Hot, unpleasant environments contribute to irritation, confl ict, and lethargy. Studies have shown that students perform signi cantly bet- ter on academic tasks at 22.5 C (72.5 F) than at 26 C (79 F). Decoration: Blank walls are boring. Decorate your walls with posters and other materials that stimulate interest and showcase student work. # due date Description points possible my score assignment % total possible my total cumulative % 1 5-Sep hw - 10 85355 80% 20 16 80% 4 12-Sep lab 1 - photosynthesis 20 18 90% 34 85% 5 14-Sep hw 50 84%6 16-Sep journal - climate change 10 10 8 80% 75 60 80% 9 22-Sep lab 2 - respiration 20 15 75% 95 75 79% 10 23-Sep unit 1 test 50 45 90% 145 120 83% Figure 25.2 Sample Student Assignment Sheet Figure 25.3 Sample Extra - Credit Note c25.indd 524 c25.indd 524 5/9/08 5:26:55 PM 5/9/08 5:26:55 PMPlanning and Managing Science Instruction 525 Organization: Don ' t expect your students to be organized if you are not. Clean, organized classrooms and laboratories are safer and more pleasant than messy, disorganized rooms. Instruction for substitutes: Keep a guide for substitutes in your classroom desk: a photo-graphic seating chart, list of classroom rules and procedures, daily and weekly schedule, semester plan, lesson plans, procedures for collecting and disseminating papers, and extra worksheets and curricular materials that can be used at any time. Include your e - mail address and telephone number so substitutes can call for clari cation. Praise students appropriately: Offer genuine praise. Intermittent praise is the most power-ful way to reinforce positive behavior. If you praise students all the time or simply for doing what is expected, they may not strive to do more. T ell them when they have excelled and how they can improve. Be speci c. Provide wait time: T eachers often allow only a few seconds of silence after asking questions. In such situations, many students don ' t bother formulating answers because it is easier to wait for one of the \" regulars \" to do so. Wait time encourages greater student involvement and more thoughtful and developed responses. Use silent clues for getting attention: Do not proceed with instruction when there is class noise, and don ' t raise your voice to get student attention. Silent methods, such as dimming the light or having students raise their hands and close their mouths whenever you raise your hand, are generally far more effective and less energy intensive. Discipline Fairly and Consistently Minimize interruptions: Deal with disruptions with as little interruption as possible. Many problems can be taken care of after class or during guided practice. Don ' t allow student misbehavior to steal time away from other students. Have clear expectations: Establish clear, written behavior standards and explicit consequences. Be consistent in your enforcement of standards. Don ' t argue with students: Arguments are emo- tional encounters, provide an opportunity for offending students to justify their actions, and may undermine your authority, particularly when occurring in front of other students. Start fresh everyday: Don ' t hold grudges. It hurts you, your reputation, and your relation-ship to all your students. Never give schoolwork as punishment: Giving homework as a punishment suggests that learn-ing is a punishment. Assertive discipline: Lee and Marlene Canter advocate a take - control approach to manage-ment in which teachers establish clear rules and directions and identify the limits of accept-able behavior. More information on assertive discipline can be obtained by reading their books or by searching online (search \" assertive discipline \" ). 7 Positive classroom discipline: Fred Jones is the author of Positive Classroom Discipline, a non- adversarial approach to managing student dis-ruption, emphasizing high behavior stand ards and personal responsibility. 8 More information on positive discipline can be obtained from books or online (search positive discipline). 9 25.6 Assessing Student Performance Assessment is the process of documenting the knowl- edge, skills, and attitudes of students. Assessment can be formative, summative, subjective, objective, criterion - referenced, or norm - referenced. Formative Assessment Madeline Hunter, an infl uential American educator and author of numerous works on curriculum and instruction, wrote, \" T o say that you have taught when students haven ' t learned is to say you have sold when no one has bought. But how can you know that students have learned without spending hours correcting tests and papers? . . . Check stu-dents' understanding while you are teaching (not at 10 o ' clock at night when you ' re correcting papers) c25.indd 525 c25.indd 525 5/9/08 5:26:58 PM 5/9/08 5:26:58 PM526 The Sourcebook for Teaching Science so you don ' t move on with unlearned material that can accumulate like a snowball and eventu-ally engulf the student in confusion and despair. \" 10 Hunter was speaking of the need for formative assessment \u2014 feedback from learning activities that is used by the instructor to adapt teaching to meet the immediate needs of learners. The following are techniques for formative assessment: 11 Audience response systems: Audience response systems (personal response systems) can be used to collect and analyze student responses to multiple - choice and true - false questions. Such devices provide immediate feedback to speci c prompts, but do not allow full text entry as is needed for free - response questions (Figure 25.4 ). Electronic groups: If your classroom has access to the Internet, use an electronic chatroom or newsgroup to elicit student responses to your questions (see sciencesourcebook.com ). Think/pair/share: Provide students with time to write a response to a thought - provoking ques-tion, then additional time to discuss it with their neighbor before sharing their conclusion with the class. Interview: Interview students about their think- ing as they solve problems. This metacognitive strategy works well during guided practice or in the laboratory when using rotating labs (sec-tion 22.5). Whiteboards: Prepare student whiteboards by cutting white shower board (inexpensive, lam inated, waterproof board sold at home improvement centers for lining showers) into small rectangles. Many home improvement stores will cut it for you. Provide students with dry erase markers and ask them to write, draw, or diagram answers to questions you pose. When asked, all students should hold up their boards simultaneously, providing you with a quick assessment of what students understand. Voting: Provide several possible answers to a question. Then ask students to vote for the answer by raising their hands. Quick - writes: Throughout your lesson, ask students to demonstrate their understanding by answering prompts in their science note-books. 12 Y ou can scan student responses as you move through the class. If few are writing, then it is likely that few understand. Summative Assessment Summative assessments are provided at the end of a unit to determine how much students have learned. They provide information for determining grades and giving students feedback on their per-formance. Summative assessments may come in the form of papers, homework problems, lab reports (Activity 3.4.1), projects (sections 22.3 and 23.1 - 23.4), quizzes, and tests, and can include objective or subjective tasks. Objective tasks have clear right and wrong answers, examples of which include mathematical solutions, multiple choice, true - false, and ll - in - the - blank questions. Subjective tasks are more open - ended, do not have obvious right and wrong answers, and must be evaluated 123 456 789 L0H Personal ResponseSystem computer Student responses1 2 34 5 6 studentsstudentsA I.

C riterion - referenced assessments are based on content expectations, and norm - referenced assess- ments compare students to others who have taken the same test. Students pass criterion - referenced tests by obtaining a score in excess of a predeter-mined cut score; they pass norm - referenced tests by performing better than a given percentage of others who took the same test. 25.7 Evaluating Teaching Performance T eachers should be refl ective practitioners. They should evaluate their lessons and take steps to improve them. Perhaps the easiest way to evaluate your teach- ing is by examining video clips of classroom les-sons. Set up a video camera on a tripod in the back of the room, and make a recording of a class session. Make certain to secure approval from your administration before videotaping students. Watch the video and evaluate using the criteria in Table 25.4 . It is helpful to view the video with the sound off, and then listen to it with the pic-ture off. Is there enough visual information to understand the lesson in the absence of sound? Is there enough auditory information to understand the lesson in the absence of video? Table 25.4 is adapted from the student teaching evaluation for secondary school teachers at California State University, Northridge, and may also be used to evaluate teachers you mentor. c25.indd 528 c25.indd 528 5/9/08 5:27:00 PM 5/9/08 5:27:00 PM529 Chapter Twenty-Six The Science Laboratory 26.1 Equipping the Science Laboratory 529 26.2 Writing Successful Grant Proposals 533 26.3 Common and Inexpensive Sources of Chemicals 534 26.4 Preparing Solutions 538 26.5 Laboratory Safety 540 26.6 Safety Equipment Checklist 540 26.7 Chemical Hazards and Storage 542 26.8 Disposal of Chemicals 546 26.9 Accidents 547 26.1 Equipping the Science Laboratory Science activities and experiments require a vari- ety of equipment and materials. Although most science departments have budgets, the funds are generally insuf cient to fully equip middle or high school science laboratories. Nevertheless, there are ways that science teachers can equip or augment their laboratories. Cash Purchases Science Budget Most schools have line - item budgets for their science departments. The amount of the budget varies from school to school but is generally relatively small on a per - student basis. Department members should submit their requests to their chair in writing, and the department chair should maintain a spreadsheet of proposed expen-ditures (Figure 26.1 ). Most schools work on annual budgets, and unspent money from the science department is returned to the general fund. A depart-ment that does not use all of its funds is usually allotted less in the following year under the assump-tion that it does not need what was previously budg-eted. The department chair should keep a close watch on the budget and make speci c requests at the time the administration is drafting the next year ' s budget. Petty Cash T eachers often need to purchase items at a grocery, hardware, or online store to complement a laboratory exercise. Many schools reimburse teachers for such purchases through a petty cash system. T eachers should photocopy and submit all receipts for for Teaching Science online auctions. Unfortunately, these rms rarely offer any warranty, so the buyer should beware. Although risks are higher than with traditional sci-enti c supply companies, the monetary savings can be substantial. Many schools have policies to reim-burse teachers for online equipment purchases. In - Kind Contributions Parents and Community Members Parents are often eager to provide resources for the science classes at their children ' s schools. Y ou can con-nect with the parents of your students through school newsletters, the school Web site, your class Web site, the parent - teacher association, back - to - school night, open house, and fl yers sent home with your students. We suggest that you prepare a letter (Figure 26.2 ) expressing your needs, accom-panied by a tax - deductible donation form. The form should meet the guidelines of your school, district, and state and should have the approval of your administrative staff. Students T eachers often spend much time collect- ing resources that could be more easily collected by students. Students who contribute by providing resources tend to have a greater sense of ownership and commitment to class, so engaging them in the process not only saves the teacher time but also Year - End Funds Most schools operate on a yearly budget, with the new budget year begin-ning in July or shortly after the closing of the academic session. Science chairs should maintain spreadsheets (Figure 26.1 ) of their \" wish lists \" and present them to their administrators in the event that there are surplus funds in science department or discretionary budgets. It is common for admin-istrators to make purchases to empty discretionary accounts at the end of the scal year, and science departments can bene t by submitting requests at this time. Grants A variety of public and private agen- cies offer grants for improving science education. T eachers are advised to search the Internet and talk with their district science specialists to identify realistic opportunities. In addition, many schools and districts maintain a grants Web site to sum-marize current opportunities for secondary educa-tion. It is critical to follow the guidelines speci ed in the request for proposal (RFP) provided by the funding agency. Section 26.2 lists tips for writing successful proposals.

(Continued)Figure 26.2 Letter Requesting Support for the Science for Teaching Science gets students more involved in their education. Following is a list of the kinds of free resources that students can gather from the Internet, their homes, or the eld. Caution: Students should never be instructed to collect anything that is haz-ardous, and parents should be noti ed of your requests: Earth science: soil samples, rocks, minerals, petri ed wood, crystals, weather maps, weather reports, current maps, water samples, contain-ers, tide reports, earthquake reports, hurricane maps, topographic maps, digital images Biology: pond water, water quality samples, mold, fl owers, leaves, fruits, seeds, teeth, owl pellets, yeast, containers, cleaning supplies, casts of animal tracks, digital photos of ecosystems Chemistry: household chemicals (see section 26.3), plastic bottles, paper towels, clean-ing supplies, goggles, containers, stirrers, Styrofoam cups, food coloring, candles Physics: old electronic equipment, computers, meter sticks, lenses, magnets, candles, hard-ware, marbles, balls, carts, timers, tape, string, rope, wood, fasteners Parent - Teacher Association Parent - teacher associations (PTA) often raise money to support special activities and events. Many science teach-ers have found that their PTA is eager to support academic activities once they know what those activities are. Make your needs known to the PTA and attend meetings. Remember, it is a parent - teacher association. Major Firms Engineering rms, hospitals, universities, and other large institutions peri-odically donate used computers, furniture, glass-ware, and electronic equipment. Contact the asset management of ce at an institution near you and learn how it dispenses with old equipment. Much of the time it is donated to local schools, but only when faculty make a speci c request. Many tax - supported agencies (such as public universities) are required to offer other tax - supported agen-cies (such as public schools) rst choice when dispensing with old equipment. Businesses Businesses often discard equip- ment that may nevertheless be useful in the science lab. For example, car stereo installation compa-nies throw away old speakers that could be used to study sound or taken apart for strong magnets, and of ce supply companies throw away paper and supplies from damaged packages. Business owners are generally eager to donate such mate-rials to local schools and are often willing to pro-vide new materials as well. Businesses may receive credit for tax - deductible donations to school sci-ence laboratories (Figure 26.2 ). Many colleges and businesses offer local schools equipment they no longer use, and science classrooms can receive Receipt for Tax Deductible Donation This con rms that donated $ cash OR supplies and equipment valued at $ to the science education program at School.

In addition, federal organiza tions such as NASA are required to offer schools excess or old laboratory equipment. Figure 26.2 lists things that businesses can provide. Making Your Own Equipment Much sci- enti c equipment can be constructed from things in your garage. Expensive solutions can be made inexpensively through dilutions such as shown in section 26.4. Book and Video Libraries Many public libraries allow teachers to check out more books and movies than other patrons and keep them for longer periods of time. Most libraries have numer-ous science - related movies (such as Scienti c American Frontiers, Nova, Discover Channel, and Bill Nye ) that can be checked out or down- loaded to your computer. Libraries frequently discard older books and magazines that they no longer have room to store. Ask your librar-ian to save science - related books and magazines such as Astronomy, Discover, National Geographic, Popular Science, Science, Science Daily, Science News, Science Now, Scienti c American, Sky and Telescope, Smithsonian, and The Scientist. 26.2 Writing Successful Grant Proposals A variety of public and private agencies offer grants for improving science education. T eachers are advised to search the Internet and talk with their district science specialists to identify realis-tic opportunities. In addition, many schools and districts maintain a grants Web Site to summarize current opportunities for secondary education. It is critical to follow the guidelines speci ed in the request for proposal (RFP) provided by the fund-ing agency. Following are tips for writing success-ful proposals: Cover letter (1 page maximum): The cover letter should be written on school stationery and signed by a school administrator. Describe the purpose in terms that are consistent with the organization ' s RFP . Explain how your project will accomplish its goals and improve science edu-cation for the students at your school. Provide contact information, including telephone, e - mail addresses, and relevant Web sites. Abstract (1 - 3 paragraphs, 300 words maxi- mum): The abstract is the rst portion of the proposal and should be no more than 300 words. Describe the project, including the needs that are addressed, the equipment that is to be acquired, and the methods for implementation. Describe the project goals and expected outcomes, and explain how these will be met. Summarize the costs, and provide the expected date of completion. Background: Funding agencies provide resou- rces to those they believe will best ful ll the goals and objectives of the RFP . Provide evidence that you have done thorough research on the topic, include relevant literature, and reference exter-nal benchmarks and standards. For example, if you are requesting funds to equip your labora-tory with probeware, cite research articles showing how probeware improves student research or cite standards calling for accurate data measurement. Statement of need: Explain the signi cance of this project to your students, the learning com-munity, or education in general. Outline current resources that address the issues, identify gaps in these resources, and explain how your project will ll these gaps. Project description: Explain your project in detail. Describe how you will conduct the research or implement the project you have proposed. Agencies usually will not fund equipment - based proposals unless there is assurance that such equipment will be put to good use in action research (research conducted by classroom teach- ers concurrent with their teaching) to develop a new program or offer students new opportunities. 1 If your proposal includes a research component, describe the methodology. Express the potential long - term impact and infl uence of the project. Goals and evaluation criteria: What speci c goals are you trying to achieve? What measur-able criteria will you reach for Teaching Science How will you know whether you are achieving your goals? What records and information will you keep so you can measure your progress?

Zinc Zn Recent American pennies (1982-present) are 97.5% zinc with a 2.5% copper coating. of the component atoms (see the periodic table in Figure 27.1 ). For example, NaHCO 3 is 84 g/mol = 1 sodium (23 g/mol) + 1 hydrogen (1 g/mol) + 1 carbon (12 g/mol) + 3 oxygens (16 g/mol) = 23 + 1 + 12 + 3(16) = 84 g/mol . Performing Dilutions A dilute solution can be made by adding solvent to a more concentrated solution. The number of moles of solute before dilution equals the number of moles following dilution. Knowing this, the dilution formula can be derived: M 1 V 1 = M 2 V 2 where M 1 is the initial molarity, V 1 is the initial volume, M 2 is the nal molarity, and V 2 is the nal volume. If the concentration ( C ) of a solution is expressed in grams solute/liter solution, the dilu-tion equation becomes C 1 V 1 = C 2 V 2 This equation is derived from the principle that the initial number of grams of solute must equal the nal number (conservation of mass). Sample Dilution Problem (Molarity) Pre- pare a 100 mL solution of 0.1 M NaOH from a stock solution of 1.0 M NaOH, Most additives do not affect performance, but you should examine ingredients to note the percent-age concentration and adjust quantities as neces-sary. Y ou should perform all experiments yourself and assess safety concerns prior to classroom implementation. 26.4 Preparing Solutions Preparing Stock Solutions Many laboratory activities require speci c molar concentrations of aqueous stock solutions of solu-ble inorganic and organic compounds. Molarity is de ned as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. Before making a stock solution, calculate the formula weight (generally written on the side of the container), and measure the appropriate mass of solute. For example, to make a 1 mol solu-tion of NaCl, measure out 58.5 g of NaCl (NaCl has a formula weight of 58.5 g/mol) and place in a volumetric fl ask. Add water slowly while stirring until a solution volume of 1 L is reached. T o make a 2 mol solution of NaCl, it is necessary to dis-solve 117 g of NaCl (117 g represents two moles of NaCl) and add water until the 1 L mark is reached. Many activities are qualitative and do not require precise concentrations. In such situations, it is appropriate to use less precise containers, such as graduated cylinders, to prepare stock solutions. If the formula weight is not printed on the con- tainer, it may be calculated by adding the masses Table 26.1 (Continued) 539 Table 26.2 Preparing Acid and Base Stock Solutions To Make These Solutions . . .Dissolve This in 1 L of Solution.To Make These Solutions . . .

(initial (initial molarity) volume) M 2 = 0.1 M NaOH V 2 = 100 mL ( nal molarity) ( nal volume) V 1 = M 2 V 2 / M 1 = (0.1 M NaOH)(100 mL)/ (1.0 M NaOH) = 10 mL Therefore, dilute 10 mL of 1.0 M NaOH solution by adding solvent to a nal volume of 100 mL. Sample Dilution Problem (Grams/Liter) A solution contains 20 g of sodium chloride per liter of solution. Dilute so the resulting solution contains only 4 g of sodium chloride per liter of solution. C 1 = (20 g NaCl)/L V 1 = 1 L C 2 = (4 g NaCl)/L V 2 = ? V 2 = C 1 V 1 / C 2 = (20 g NaCl/L)(1 L)/(4 g NaCl/L) = 5 L. Thus, dilute 1 L of the original solution to a nal volume of 5 L. Preparing Acid and Base Solutions Perform dilutions in only a fume hood or other well - ventilated area. Acids irritate skin and acid vapors damage the eyes and respiratory system. Always wear goggles and a lab coat when working with acids and bases. Table 26.2 illustrates how to make dilutions from concentrated reagents. When diluting, always add acid to water. Never add water to acid due to the danger of splattering. Neutralize acid spills with baking soda (NaHCO 3 , sodium hydrogen carbonate) before wiping up with water. Always add the acid or base slowly, and stir with a glass rod. Only teachers or other professionals should dilute concentrated acids and Teaching Science 26.5 Laboratory Safety T eachers, administrators, school board mem- bers, and school district science specialists are responsible for maintaining a safe school envi-ronment. Any or all of these parties may be held liable for injury if they have been negligent in their duties to protect student health and safety. All teachers must abide by their school, district, county, and state safety policies! Science teachers should provide safety instruc- tion, supervise all activities in the classroom and laboratory, and ensure that safety equipment and facil ities are well maintained. They should pass a district or school - approved safety and rst - aid course. It is wise for teachers to talk with their per- sonal and school insurance representatives to make sure that they carry the appropriate liability insur-ance. Although schools and districts generally carry insurance policies, you should not assume that these policies provide adequate protection for teachers in all situations. In the event of a lawsuit pertaining to student injury, the courts may analyze the actions of the school, district, and individual to determine the degree of responsibility that can be attributed to each. T eachers must be diligent to promote a safe laboratory environment and model all safety proce-dures. The following is a list of things that should be done to promote a safe laboratory experience. Teachers Should: Post state, district, and school - approved safety guidelines and procedures. Post emergency contact numbers (see section 26.8). Post emergency (procedures for res earth- quakes, and other disasters). Abide by state, district, and school policies. Avoid activities that are unsafe given the equip-ment and facilities. Monitor all student activity in the laboratory. Pass a district - or state - approved safety and rst - aid course. Perform routine laboratory safety checks. Ensure that safety and rst - aid equipment is available and maintained. Provide students with prelaboratory activities that highlight safety concerns. Remind students of general and speci c hazards. To Be Admitted to the Laboratory, Students Should First Pass a laboratory safety test. Return a signed school or district - approved safety agreement (Figure 26.3 ) . Complete all prelaboratory activities as re quired by the teacher. 26.6 Safety Equipment Checklist The following safety equipment should be avail- able in the science laboratory.

These sheets include pertinent safety and health information compiled by OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), and the National Library of Medicine. Keep this informa-tion in an appropriate location, and be mindful of the possible dangers of chemicals in the laboratory. c26.indd 542 c26.indd 542 5/9/08 4:30:06 PM 5/9/08 4:30:06 PMThe Science Laboratory 543 Figure 26.4 Sample Material Safety Data Sheet c26.indd 543 4:30:07 Sourcebook for Teaching Science NFPA Hazard Codes The National Fire Protection Association has devel- oped a standard label to display chemical hazard ratings (Figure 26.5 ). The NFPA label is required by many institutions, industries, and municipali-ties and is found on most new chemical reagent containers. The left diamond is blue and indicates toxicity (health hazard), the top diamond is red and indicates fl ammability, the right diamond is yellow and indicates reactivity. The bottom dia-mond is white and is reserved for special warnings such as radioactivity or reactivity with water. Fire and Fire Extinguisher Codes Fire extinguishers are classi ed by the res they extinguish. For example, an ABC extinguisher can be used on class A, B, and C res. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) classi es res as follows: Class A res involve ordinary combustibles such as wood, paper, and cloth and can be extinguished by water. Class B res involve fl ammable and combus- tible liquids, greases, and similar materials. They are best extinguished by smothering with noncombustible gases such as carbon dioxide or halon. Class C res involve electrical equipment and should be extinguished with a material that is electrically nonconducting to avoid shock hazard. Class D res involve combustible metals like magnesium and must be extinguished by a heat - absorbing material that does not react with the burning metal. Chemical Storage Categories Explosions, res, toxic fumes, and other hazards can arise if incompatible chemicals are acci-dentally mixed. For a list of reactive chemicals, see Bretherick ' s Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards. 2 T o minimize the possibility of such hazards, the fronts of all chemical storage shelves should be equipped with horizontal bars so chemicals will not fall in the event of an earth-quake. Chemicals should also be stored with other compatible chemicals and separated by appro-priate distances from incompatible chemicals. The following storage classi cation system was suggested by the California State Department of Education: 3 Metals: All metals except mercury can be stored together. Metals should be stored sepa-rate from all oxidizers, halogens, organic com-pounds, and moisture. Oxidizers (except ammonium chlo-rates, perchlorates, and peroxides.

Compressed gases: Compressed gas cylinders should be strapped to the wall. Oxidizing gases such as oxygen should be stored far away from fl ammable liquids, gases, and metals. Flammable gases should be separated from oxidizers and oxidizing gases by a 1 hour re- wall or a distance of 8 meters. Low - hazard chemicals: Many weak bases, oxides, sul des, indicators, amino acids, sug- ars, stains, and carbonates are classi ed as low - hazard chemicals. These chemicals may be stored on open shelves with bars to prevent accidental spillage. Storage Codes Some manufacturers provide color - coded labels to categorize chemicals for storage purposes (Table 26.3 ). Chemicals with a common storage color may be stored together, except when indicated otherwise. Chemicals with different storage color labels should be stored in different areas. Hazard Symbols Hazard symbols are designed to warn about haz- ardous materials or locations. Figure 26.5 lists some of the more common hazard labels.

May react violently with air, water, or other sub- stances. Store away from fl ammable and combustible materials. Storage code Blue Health hazard. These chemicals are toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. They should be stored in a locked cabinet. Storage code White Corrosive. These chemicals may harm skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. They should be stored away from red-, yellow-, and blue-coded reagents. Storage code Gray Moderate or minimal hazard. According to current data, these chemicals do not pose more than a moderate hazard in any category.be separated from metals, acids, organic mate- rials, and ammonium nitrate. They should be separated from fl ammable liquids by a 1 hour rewall or a distance of 8 meters. Ammonium nitrate: Ammonium nitrate should be stored in isolation from all other chemicals. Bases: All strong bases, such as sodium hydrox- ide or potassium hydroxide, should be stored in a dedicated corrosive chemicals cabinet that is coated with corrosion - resistant material. Acids: All inorganic acids (except nitric acid) and all regulated organic acids should be stored in a cabinet constructed of corrosion - resistant material. Acids may be stored with bases, but fumes from acids and bases may produce an annoying coating of salt crystals on the outside of reagent containers. Nitric acid should be stored separately from acetic acid. Fuming nitric acid should never be used in the school laboratory. Flammables: Flammables should be stored in a dedicated fl ammable materials cabinet, 8 meters away from all oxidizers. The cabinet should be coated with fl ame retardant paint and should be labeled with the notice: flam- mable liquid storage. keep fire away! Poisons: Highly toxic substances such as cyanides should never be used in a school laboratory.

Consult your local environ-mental health and safety specialist regarding the policies and regulations in your school, commu-nity, and state. Drain Disposal The National Research Council ' s Committee on Hazardous Substances in the Laboratory has pub-lished detailed information regarding the han-dling of chemical waste. 4 The committee approves Table 26.5 Nonhazardous Solids That Can Be Disposed of in the Trash Inorganic Chemicals borates of Na, K, Mg, Ca carbonates of Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, NH4 chlorides of Na, K, Mgfl uorides of Ca oxides of B, Mg, Ca, Sr, Al, Si, Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Znphosphates of Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, NH 4 sulfates of Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, NH4Organic Chemicals naturally occurring a-amino acids and salts citric acid and its Na, K, Mg, Ca, and NH4 salts lactic acid and its Na, K, Mg, Ca, and NH4 salts sugars and starches Laboratory Materials Not Contaminated with Hazardous Materialschromatographic paper and absorbents, lter paper, lter aids, low - toxic - hazard cati- ons and anions for disposal down the drain with excess water in quantities up to 100 g at a time (Table 26.4 ). Any strongly acidic or basic substances should be neutralized before disposal. Always con- sult local policies and regulations before disposing of chemical wastes in your laboratory drain. Trash Disposal In most areas, nonhazardous solids can be dis- posed of in the trash (Table 26.5 ). Liquid wastes are generally not allowed in sanitary land lls and should not be placed in the trash. The following types of solid laboratory waste are generally con-sidered nonhazardous or of low toxicity and may be placed in the trash, depending on quantities involved. Always consult local policies before dispos- ing of chemical wastes in the trash. c26.indd 546 c26.indd 546 5/9/08 4:30:10 PM 5/9/08 4:30:10 PMThe Science Laboratory 547 Emergency 911 Campus Police School Nurse School Office School Safety OfficerDistrict Science Specialist Animal Control Toxic Substances Control County HealthDepartmentState Department of Education OSHA osha.gov EPA epa.gov Figure 26.6 Emergency Contacts with Local Numbers 26.9 Accidents Accidents happen regardless of preparation and protocol.

Scientists are encour-aged to express all measurements in SI units so colleagues around the world can interpret them readily. Fundamental SI Units A fundamental unit is one that cannot be expressed in simpler terms. It is de ned by a phys- ical standard of measurement. The seven funda-mental quantities and their SI units are as follows: Quantity Unit Symbol length meter m mass kilogram kg time second s temperature kelvin K amount mole mol charge coulomb C luminous intensity candela cd Derived SI Units A derived unit is one that can be expressed in terms of fundamental units. Volume, for example, is expressed as length cubed, and veloc-ity is expressed as length (distance) per time. Table 27.1 lists the seven fundamental SI units and a variety of derived SI units in terms of these funda mental units. Capitalization Unit Names When written in full, all units begin with a lowercase letter: Correct : kelvin, farad, newton, joule, hertz, degree Incorrect : Kelvin, Farad, Newton, Joule, Hertz, D e g r e e Unit Symbols The rst letter in a unit sym- bol is uppercase when the unit name is derived from a person ' s name. The following is a list of units that are named after famous scientists. Note that the unit name is not capitalized, but the unit symbol is. c27.indd 549 c27.indd 549 5/9/08 6:12:09 PM 5/9/08 6:12:09 PM550 Teaching Science (a, f, p, n, /H9262 , m, c, d, da, h, k). The symbols representing factors greater than or equal to 1 mil-lion are always capitalized (M, G, T, P , E). Periods Periods are never used after a symbol, except at the end of a sentence. Decimals For numbers less than 1, a zero is written before the decimal point. Correct: 0.03256 0.5234 Incorrect: .03256 .5234 Compound Units A centered dot is used to indicate that a unit is the product of two or more units. Correct: N \u00b7 m kg \u00b7 m/s2 Incorrect: N m k g m / s2 Differentiating Quantity Symbols and Unit Symbols By convention, quantity symbols are italicized, but unit symbols are not. Quantity symbols represent a physical quantity such as time, mass, and length, while unit symbols represent speci c measures of those quantities, such as seconds, kilograms, and meters. Quantity Symbols (Italicized) Unit Symbols (Not Italicized) time, t seconds, s mass, m kilograms, kg length, l meter, m heat, Q joule, J ampere A Andr \u00e9 Amp \u00e8 principles of electrodynamics. coulomb C Charles Coulomb: discovered the law of force between charged bodies. farad F Michael Faraday: pioneered research in electricity and magnetism. henry H Joseph Henry: discovered electromagnetic induction and self - induction. hertz Hz Heinrich Hertz: discovered radio waves. joule J James Joule: pioneered research in thermodynamics. kelvin K William Thomson (Lord Kelvin): developed the absolute temperature scale. newton N Isaac Newton: pioneered work in forces, calculus, optics, and gravitation. ohm Georg Ohm: discovered the relation- ship between current, voltage, and resistance. Pascal Pa Blaise Pascal: discovered basic principles of hydrostatics. tesla T Nikola Tesla: developed the AC motor and high - voltage transformers. volt V Allesandro Volta: invented the rst battery. watt W James Watt: developed the steam engine as a practical power source. weber Wb Wilhelm Weber: performed early research in electricity and magnetism. The following units are not named after peo- ple, and therefore their symbols are not capital-ized: degree, .

If you copy them on transparency lm, you can use them as meas- urement tools. For example, you can lay the trans-parent rulers over an object to measure its length, or place the centimeter graph paper over an irregular object to measure its area. Y ou can also use them on the overhead projector to plot data and measure objects. Students will nd it much easier to learn how to plot data if they can watch the instructor plot the same data on the same type of graph paper. Y ou can make inexpensive rulers by copying the image onto transparency lm and then cutting them apart with scissors. This section provides linear graph paper, semilog paper, log - log graph paper, polar graph paper, and rulers. c27.indd 559 c27.indd 559 5/9/08 6:12:18 PM 700 600 500 400 300 100200 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 1020 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 12 1 0 23456789 1 0 Figure 27.4 Semilogarithmic Graph Paper 562 5/9/08 6:12:20 PM 5/9/08 6:12:20 PM2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 92345678923456789 1 1 1111 Figure 27.5 Log-Log Graph Paper Chapter Two 1.
