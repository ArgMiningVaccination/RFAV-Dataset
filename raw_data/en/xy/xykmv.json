Ramey, Jr. Co-Principal Investigator, Stanford Geothermal Program Department of Petroleum Engineering S t anf ord University Stanford, CA. 94305 The First Stanford Geothermal Reservoir Engineering Workshop was held in mid-December, 1975. The RANN research programs, funded by the National Science Foundation, were just getting underway, and the inter - national geothermal industry was quite small. The program committee for the first workshop in 1975 used as guidelines the selection of papers from industry, educational research, and various state and federal insti - tutions involved in the newborn geothermal industry. Much of the infor - mation presented at this workshop was a recounting of research plans for the future. The meeting was fully attended, and a good cross -section of national and international interests in geothermal energy was represented at the first workshop. A complete spectrum of attendees from national and international geothermal organizations indicated the growing impor - tance of reservoir engineering to the rapid development of geothermal energy. The Second Geothermal Reservoir Engineering Workshop was held in mid-December, 1976. This meeting was truly exceptional in that many of the attendees were now reporting accomplished research and results from actual field operations. This was contrasted to the previous meeting, which focused mainly on research intentions. Dr. Care1 Otte, president of Union Oil Company's Geothermal Division, presented the keynote address at the second geothermal workshop and focused his attention on the impend - ing importance of federal, state, and local regulation of the new geother - mal industry. This workshop, like the first one, was sold out, and it was necessary to limit papers presented at the workshop. was set by the program committee for the second workshop to publish papers offered for the meeting in the Proceedings. two geothermal workshops became important references during the third year. However, a policy The Proceedings of the first The Third Geothermal Workshop was held in mid-December, 1977. Dean Richard H. Jahns presented the keynote address for the Third Workshop, welcoming an international group of geothermal reservoir engineers. The Third Geothermal Reservoir Engineering Workshop was truly remarkable in that candid, open presentations of results of field experimentation with geothermal energy were presented by many of the speakers. The nature of the presentations underlined the importance of free exchange of informa - tion to augment the development of geothermal energy to meet national needs. Again, a large international contingent of attendees was present at the meeting. Important and unique field information was presented, and the Proceedings of this workshop now appear to join those of the first two workshops as unique references in this field of geothermal reservoir engin - eer ing . -1 - The program committee for the Fourth Geothermal Workshop, presented in mid-December, 1978, decided that the format of the last two geothermal workshops should be continued; that is, the objective should be documented talks on field phenomena and reports on important results of research di - rectly applicable to geothermal energy development. discussion of problems of common importance was also built into the pro- gram. Finally, it was decided to publish all submitted papers in the proceedings, but to select papers for presentation at the workshop program. The keynote speaker for the Fourth Geothermal1 Workshop program was Dr. Rob- ert Rex, president of Republic Geothermal Corporation, who spoke on \"Credibility of Geothermal Reservoir Engineering Calculations. 'I The main thrust of this talk was focused on the reception of reservoir engineering work by financial institutions involved in funding geothermal energy de- velopments. An arranged panel The Department of Energy was the funding agency for both the third and fourth workshops. The Introduction to the fourth workshop pointed out that geothermal reservoir engineering had finally come of age. The hall- marks of the geothermal reservoir engineering workshops had clearly become (1) an open exchange of information, and (2) the presentation of results, as opposed to plans or intentions. The main focus of the Stanford geother - mal reservoir engineering program has become augmentation of ongoing field operations. The papers presented at the fourth workshop indicated that other participants were dedicated to the same objective. Attendees at the Fourth Geothermal Reservoir Engineering Workshop in December, 1978, were enthusiastic about the scheduling of a fifth workshop in December, 1979. Plans have already been s,et for this meeting. We offer the Proceedings of the Fourth Geothermal Reservoir Engineering Workshop to the geothermal reservoir engineering communit:y in anticipation of important presentations to come during the fifth workshop in December, 1979. -2- RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DGE PROGRAM Marshall Reed, Program Manager Division of Geothermal Energy Department of Energy 20 Massachusetts Av. N.W. Washington, D.C. 20545 This Fourth Workshop on Geothermal Reservoir Engineering demonstrates the success of this workshop series at Stanford. The Division of Geothermal Energy of the U. S. Department of Energy funds this and other geothermal work- shops to accomplish a transfer of technology and exchange of information between the research community and the geothermal industry. The active par- ticipation of industry representatives in this workshop is an indication of its worth. On December 8, 1978, the Division of Geothermal Energy was reorganized Rudy Black, the past Director of the division, into technical disciplines. has become the Resource Manager for Geothermal Energy under the Assistant Secretary for Resource Applications. He and eight other persons from the Division are now responsible for the commercialization of geothermal energy. Bennie DiBona, the Acting Director of the Division of Geothermal Energy, and the 24 remaining staff members are organized as shown on the accompanying chart . The Reservoir Engineering Program is now under the purview of the Reser - voir Assessment Section in the Hydrothermal Support Branch. The Reservoir Assessment Section also handles programs in Exploration Technology, Industry- Coupled Drilling, and State Cooperative Low-Temperature Assessment. It is planned that this new organization will be more responsive to the needs of the geothermal industry and will be better able to coordinate related activities within the Division of Geothermal Energy. I want to thank you all for the contribution you have made to this work- shop and to the field of geothermal reservoir engineering. I look forward to the continued success of this program and to the fruitful exchange of ideas at future workshops. -3- -I -4- RECENT ACTIVITIES AT THE CERRO PRIETO FIELD 1 1 2 Alonso E., H. , Domfnguez A., B. , Lippmann, M.J. Schroeder, R.C. , and Witherspoon, P.A. 1 2 2 Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Earth Sciences Division 2 'Comisidn Federal de Electricidad Coordinadora Ejecutiva California, Mgxico Berkeley, California 94720 INTRODUCTION The purpose of this paper is to describe some of the latest activities of interest to reservoir engineers at the Cerro Prieto geothermal field. Special emphasis is given to the wells drilled in 1978 for exploration purposes and to provide steam to the existing and future power plants. output is 75MW. March and May 1979, while the total generating capacity at Cerro Prieto will reach about 400MW in 1985. Additional information is available in a number of papers in References 1 and 2. The present power Two additional 37.5MW units are scheduled to go on line in NEW WELLS (Figure 1) At the present time (December 1978), there are six drilling rigs active, four for new wells and two to repair old ones. reservoir conditions and depths, the Cerro Prieto field can be divided into three blocks: Block I, presently the main producing area, centered around M-5; Block 11, south of a line which approximately passes through wells M-35 and M-46; and Block 111, NE of the railroad track which roughly coincides with the trace of the Cerro Prieto fault. Because of generally different In 1978 twelve wells have been completed and three are presently being drilled. average depth of these the deepest are T-366 (298Om) and M-96 (2728m). between: (Block 11, Well and 200Om (Block 111, Wells M-102, M-103, M-124). The new production wells have reached the hot water reservoir(s) 1500 and 170Om (Block I, Wells only moderate In Block I the downhole temperatures for this block, while in Block 11, 287OC was measured at the bottom of M-181. In Block 111, the downhole temperatures in M-102 and M-104 are about 345OC, similar to M-53. To the NW, in M-94, it only reached 208OC. The lithologic column and structural conditions found in M-53, drilled in 1974, are generally repeated in wells M-102, M-103 and M-104. Nevertheless, towards the SE the -5- permeable hot zone deepens quite appreciably. 2560m in M-93, and between 2427 and 2922m in T-366. In these two wells the characteristic of the productive intervals is quite different. permeability zones were indicated by large lost circulations. On the other hand, in T-366 these losses were minimal, and visual inspection of the recovered cores indicate low permeabilities. (A relatively long perforated interval was installed in this well.) drilling muds at rest These values suggest that after cleaning the wells and a heating up period, the temperatures will reach at least 340 C. This seems to indicate that Block I11 may have production potential, independent of an apparent decrease in permeability and increase of depth towards the SE. This area, which already has seven completed wells, will supply.steam to the Cerro Prieto I1 plant (additional llOMW by1983 and 220MW by 1985). It was found between 2400 and In M-93 high The temperatures measured in the in the well were 221OC (M-93) and 23OoC (T-366). 0 Exploration well M-96, NW of the main production area, reached basement at 0 0 about 2713m. The maximum temperature (108 C) was reached at 1977m; 97 C was measured at 30Om indicating a shallow hot aquifer. South of the field another exploratory well, S-262, penetrated basement at. 147Om. There, the highest temperature was measured at the bottom of the hole (100 C). 0 Casings (Figures 2 K-55, 45.3 lb/ft. as in M-102 and M- and 3): In most of the wells built in 1978 a 7-518\" 8, casing with Hydrill Super EU thread was used. When required, ,94, a 5\" 8, K-55, 23 lb/ft. liner with Super EU thread was installed. Recently it was decided to change the diameter of the production casing to 9-518'' 8 to increase steam production and because it is easier to obtain commercially. In M-103 and T-366 a 9-518\" 8, N-80, 47 lblft. production with Buttress thread and 7\" (?I, N-80, 29 lblft. hanging and cemented liner with Hydrill Super EU thread were installed. grade of casing larger mechanical capacity has been sought to better withstand the tension and compression stresses which have created many problems at Cerro Prieto. Nevertheless, one will have to wait to find out the corrosive effect of the geothermal fluids on this type of casing. With the new DRILLING PROBLEMS Three main problems during the drilling of these wells have been encountered: a) lost circulation during drilling and cementing operations, b) fishing problems, and c) cave-ins and stuck tools. Lost Circulation: During drilling and cementing, this is the most important problem. In some cases, circulation losses could be controlled. In other cases, like in M-93, almost lOOm were drilled with complete loss of circulation in order to clearly penetrate into the producing layer and get good production. This may result in stuck pipes and in cementing problems. With this procedure, the probability of losing cement slurry into the formation is increased. This is a severe problem because the production casing could fail when the well is heated up. In some cases, like in M-93, M-123 and 11-150, in addition to losses near the production zones, lost circulation has occurred in the upper lOOOm, while cementing the 11-314\" 8 or 13-318\" 0 surface casing. is very serious because the safety of the anchor and seals which prevent upward flows depend heavily on a good cement job. in Block 111, and is related to the high permeability of its sandy layers. This situation This problem was only encountered -6- Fishing Problems: These problems are closely related to circulation losses since they create conditions which may end with tools getting stuck in the borehole. Then, if the tools fail mechanically a fishing problem results. Some fishing operations were successful, but in M-94 and M-103 they failed. In M-94 it was decided to hang a 5\" fJ production casing in the upper part of the producing zone which remained open. Pipes which could not be fished out were left in the hole from 2328 to 2601m. This lower part of the well showed high temperatures but low permeability. Another interval of high temperature, presently covered by the casing, was detected at 160Om. It showed a maximum of 214OC. In M-103 because of the good thermal characteristics of the well, it was decided to slant-drill above the fish. The drilling was successful but there exists uncertainty about the behavior of the 9-518\" fJ production casing when the well heats up. The thermal expansion in the area of deviation may produce collapse or fracture of the casing. This is being watched as the well begins to heat up. Cave-Ins and Stuck Tools: Another problem is the caving of shales near the high temperature zones. takes too long, because of lost circulation or other causes. This is well known in the oil industry when the drilling lasts more than 60 days. In Cerro Prieto it is complicated by the presence of fractures or possibly faults which increase the probability of cavings. This results in stuck or caught tools. This occurs when the drilling operation When this situation develops, special mud conditions are used in the hole. But if this does not stop the caving, temporary plugs of cement bridging the zones affected are used to stablize the formations. This will allow the installation and cementing of casing which will definitely solve the problem. In Blocks I and I1 these types of problems have not occurred or have been easily solved following the procedure described,butin Block I11 they have been more severe. DEVELOPMENT OF NEW WELLS A number of wells drilled before 1978 were developed this year. The chemical characteristics of the separated brine produced are given in Table 1. From the 1978 wells M-102, M-114 and M-130 have been developed. Figure 4 shows the evolution of the characteristics of M-102 during the later part of its development. With time and orifice-diameter changes there is a marked variation in the wellhead pressures. However, chemical indices and the \"Na-K-Ca\" geothermo- meter remain essentially constant. are changed, these parameters are used to detect any possible variation in the downhole source of the produced steam-brine mixture. At Cerro Prieto when orifices (or purges) Total production of M-102 was 120 tonneslhr. of steam and 180 tonneslhr. of brine at 13.8 bars (200 psig). characteristics are expected to be found in the rest of the wells in Block 111, especially in T-366 and M-93 which are only beginning to heat up. This is a good well, and even better -7- .I n n W 0 -I W > W n W I1 u I T I T t L -8- WELL TESTING M- 104 1 M-IO Measurements of temperatures, pressures, flow-rates, and enthalpies have been made for several years at Cerro Prieto. During 1978 several well tests have been performed, and data from long-term measurements in M-6 and M-10 have been collected. Preliminary analyses of data have been made for the measurements listed in Table 2. The water-level data from M-6 is quite satisfactory, but are not considered to be reliable due to the different depths of penetration, and large differences in temperature at M-6 and within the producing field. When reservoir simulation is used this data will be very valuable. The well test involving M -101 has been analyzed, but the values for kh/p and +ch cannot be considered to be satisfactory, since recent reservoir models suggest that two or more separate aquifers are penetrated at different depths by the five wells involved in the test. The measurements made when M-53 was brought on-line would have made a contribution to our knowledge of that portion of the field, but anomalous increases in water level (downhole pressure) completely obscured the M-53 production effect for several weeks. The anomalous behavior has been ascribed to a medium-scale earthquake (5.3 Richter) whose epicenter was about 20km south of the production field. The water levels rose before the earthquake (in spite of the drawdown), and began to decrease slowly soon after the major shock. M-53 Entire Wellf ield Earthquake Several productivity tests have been made using two or more rate changes as a means of determining near -well parameters. The data for three such tests carried out during the long interference test with M-101 has been studied, but the multiple aquifer effects have made the parameter values difficult to determine. Two-rate Tests Presently, there are additional analyses, simulation of well tests, and new measurements in the planning stage for: 1979. Efforts will be made to determine the hydrological characteristics of the stratigraphic discontinuity between Blocks I1 and 111. n-5 I n-go H-91 I nhomogen i e t i es TABLE 2 SUHHARY OF WELL TEST RESULTS ft/psi md-f t/cp OBSERVATION PRODUC I NG I WELL WELLS I I I I 6 Entire 4.7~10 Wellfield -9- FINAL REMARKS The drilling activity at Cerro Prieto will continue at least at the present pace: six rigs will be operating in the field, about 20 new wells are scheduled to be completed in 1979. As new wells become available two-rate flow tests and long-term interference tests have been planned to establish the characteristics of different blocks of the Cerro Prieto reservoir(s).

Howard, J.E. Noble, W.J. Schwarz, and A.N. Graf Earth Sciences Division Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory University of California Berkeley, California 94720 THE GEOTHERMAL RESERVOIR ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (Including projects continued from the former NSF-RANN Geothermal Program) Fiscal year 1978 was the second year of LBL's responsibility for the Geothermal Reservoir Engineering Management Program (\"GREMP\") on behalf of the Division of Geothermal Energy of 'the Department of Energy. The history of this program through FY 1977 is explained in LBL's Earth Sciences Division Annual Report for 1978. of the program in FY 1978 are as follows: Administrative highlights 1. All projects started under the NSF-RANN program were continued. These include work done at Stanford Uni- versity; Princeton university; Systems, Science and Software; University of California at Riverside; and the University of Colorado. All of these programs were further extended into FY 1979 with the exception of the University of Colorado who chose to conclude their program. 2. Seven new projects were started. These projects are indicated in Table 1. 3. The Division of Geothermal Energy re -emphasized its concern that all projects under the CREME' program clearly and directly relate to DGE's \"power -on-line\" mission. The Review Task Force originally constitu - ted to overview the GREW program was dissolved, and plans were made to assemble a new task force. LBL was urged to solicit industry to assure that there is Federal support of research to all reservoir engineering -related technical \"hangups\" to \"power- on-line. \" the original GREMP planning document (LBL-7000) , LBL was requested to revise and update 4. With the exceptions noted below, all project areas of the original GREFP plan have been addressed as have all known serious technical reservoir -related impediments to geothermal resource development, ~ This work is sponsored by the Division of Geothermal Energy Of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract W-7405-ENG-48 -1 5- e.g., formation damage during drilling. Important projects that have not yet received this full measure of support are work on mass flow measurement techniques, on use of tracers, and on decline curve analysis, particularly enthalpy decline curve analysis. Also, in keeping with the recommendation of the Review Task Force, essen- tially nothing has been done on economics and on exploitation strategies. 5. A so-called GREW publication series was started. Henceforth all reports prepared under GREMP contract:s will be published or re- printed as part of this series. field and Terra Tek's bibliographic review will be the first two publications of this series. The program began issuing a \"Newsletter.\" Aug. 1, 1978; the second, Nov. 3. The purpose of the newsletter is to summarize the highlights of progress in research and to direct readers to new, complete reports on the research. The newsletter is available by requesting addition of one's name to the GREMP Newsletter mailing list. S31s summary of the Wairakei 6. The first was issued 7. A plan for support of new work in the GREW program through FY 1980 has been developed. The plan is shown in Figure 1. Technical and scientific progress accomplished during the year can be related to five work areas. These work areas and the contracts within them are shown in Table 1. Brief sketches of these contracts and their achievements are shown in Table 2. Technical progress on the program has been very satisfactory. Worthy of special note are the following accomplishments: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Completion of a comprehensive bibliographic review of the litera - ture pertaining to geothermal reservoir exploitation (Terra Tek) . Development of a quantitative model of a prototype geothermal resource, namely one dominated by a vertical fault (University of Colorado). Compilation of the entire production history of an important liquid dominated geothermal reservoi -r, namely Wairakei (Systems, Science and Software) . Increasing awareness of the importance of lithology logging as a practical tool during drilling of geothermal wells (University of California at Riverside). Meeting for the third time at the annual Stanford Geothermal Workshop.

Un- expected and uncontrolled subsidence can have detrimental social, environ - mental, and economic impact. In order to better understand subsidence, its causes and effects, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory initiated the Geothermal Subsidence Research Program (GSRP). The goals of the GSRP are to develop methods for assessing naturally occurring subsidence, for inferring a geothermal reservoir's compaction potential, and for minimizing potential subsidence effects during exploi - tation of a geothermal reservoir. Attainment of these goals is expected to provide the tools needed for geothermal developers to measure subsidence and to predict subsidence potential of a reservoir. For regulatory agencies, the program is expected to lead to guidance with which to recommend appropriate action to minimize impact of subsidence. - The GSRP is organized into four independent elements: 1. 2. Subsidence Characterization - Subsidence characterization is concerned with studying examples of subsidence and subsidence effects. Research has been conducted to document cases of known subsidence in geographic areas having geological and physical environments representative of geothermal areas. Where data were available, i.e., Wairakei, New Zealand, and The Geysers, California, case histories have been written. Associated studies have also been conducted on the economic and environmental impact of subsidence. These studies indicated that there is an inadequacy of the latter data. Subsidence Mensuration - Research has developed guidelines for surface monitoring surveys to establish background deformation rates and monitor possible deformation induced by geothermal development. Research to date has also assessed the state -of-the-art of well bore extenso - meters to directly measure vertical distances between points in the wellbore. Several suggestions for improved instrumentation that have resulted f'rom this research will make substantial contributions toward creating direct measurement instrumentation for use in geothermal wells. -28- Indirect measurement methods, i.e., gravity, resistivity and microseismic, have promise as inexpensive, areal survey techniques, Kesearch will be conclucted to evaluate the ability of these methods to detect: changes in the physical properties of a geothermal reservoir, and to relate these changes to reservoir compaction arid subsidence. 3. Subsidence Prediction - Ultimately, the ability to predict subsidence is dependent upon an understanding of the response of geologic materials and - systems to natural and man-made stress fields. To gain this understanding, the Geothermal Subsidence Research Program has initiated research to study the response of reservoir material to various stress field changes. Other research will assess various subsidence models, review their relative analytical merits, and, if necessary, make recommendations for new models. A related project will develop methods for physical modeling using a centrifuge. Predictions of subsidence made by numerical modeling can thus be evaluated by comparison with a centrifuge model. Out of these efforts may evolve better understanding of how geologic materials and systems respond to stress field changes, and enable earth scientists to more accurately predict subsidence over a given reservoir. A step toward greater predictive capability is the assessment of existing theory and its applicability to geothermal reservoirs. Most subsidence theories were developed to describe the compaction of oil and gas reservoirs or of relatively shallow unconsolidated aquifers. The applicability of these theories to deep, thermodynamically complex geothermal systems needs to be examined. 4. Reservoir Operating Policy - The final element in the GSRP is the development policies that minimize effects of sub- sidence. These policies are derived from the research results of the previous three elements and should provide regulators with: (a) the ability to distinguish naturally occurring sub- sidence from that possibly caused by geothermal ' operations, and (b) the basis to operate or control a geothermal field such that adverse subsidence effects are minimized or avoided. -29- ACCOMPLISHMENTS Case Histories Most documented subsiden h been due t extract i n of hyd ocarbons or ground water. geothermal fluids. little or no subsidence. environments, the stress history, and the response or lack of response at land surface, has proved useful in making comparisons to similar potential geothermal systems. Useful analogies may be drawn for the production of In some cases, deep extraction of fluids has produced A case history of the geologic and physical Four case histories were completed by Systems Control, Inc. in the following areas: Wairakei, New Zealand; Chocolate Bayou, Texas: Geysers, California; and Raft River, Idaho. The four subsidence sites were selected on the basis of: (1) physical relevance of Subsidence areas to . high priority U.S. geothermal sites in terms of withdrawn geofluid type, reservoir depth, reservoir geology and rock characteristics, and over- burden characteristics, and (2) data completeness, quality, and availability. A review of potential geothermal sites was made in order to determine the physical relevance (i.e., analogies) of areas with past subsidence to the potential geothermal sites. These case histories may serve as models for developers and/or regulators in assessing; comparable areas. Surface Monitoring - Guidelines Manual The fundamental objective of a monitoring program is to quantify the magnitude and direction of surface movements that may occur in a geothermal reservoir area immediately prior to, during, and immediately following the removal of geothermal fluids. -30- A geothermal development program must include monitoring of horizontal and vertical displacements at the surface and at depth before and during production. It should be possible to differentiate between subsidence caused by geothermal operations and that (caused by other man-induced activities, or those occurring naturally. Thus, guidelines need to be developed to obtain data directly related only to geothermal fluid production. These guidelines should consider the geologic structure, stratigraphy, and seismicity of the area, as well as the existing and proposed ground water, gas, and oil developments. The guidelines should also consider, if available, any known ground deforma - tion characteristics of the region and any man-induced deformations of nearby fluid producing fields. Woodward Clyde Consultants have produced a manual that reviews various surface monitoring methods and compares their installation, utilization, and accuracy. Utilization of these methods should enable planners and regulators to determine the natural rate of subsidence. In addition, such a manual can be used to ascertain induced subsidence during develop - ment and production of a geothermal field. Direct Measurements of Changes in Vertical Distances in a Wellbore Woodward Clyde Consultants have recommended hostile environment component testing for the following four tools: 1) induction coil with slip collar well casings, 2) reed switches with magnets emplaced in slip collars, 3) electromagnetic oscillators with magnets emplaced in slip collars, and 4) radioactive logging with tracers emplaced in either slip collars or directly into the formation. The study reviewed instruments available for monitoring subsurface Techniques and materials displacements, both vertical and horizontal. for improving existing or developing new instruments were evaluated. Elements of sensor and signal technology with potential for high temperature monitoring of subsidence were identified. -31 - Environmental and Economic Effects A contract with EDAWfEarth Science Associates resulted in assessment of data available from areas that have experienced geothermal and non- geothermal subsidence. A detailed appraisal was made of areas with the most comprehensive data base. Areas studied included desert basins in central and southern Arizona; Baldwin Hills and Inglewood, California; Galveston, Texas; Las Vegas Valley, Nevada; Mexico City, San Joaquin Valley, California; Santa Clara Valley, California; Wairakei, New Zealand; and Wilmington -Long Beach, California. Final reports from all these contracts will be available as part of an LBL subsidence report series. In FY 1978 and early in FY 1979 seven contracts were let. Four of these are near completion while three others are continuing into FY 1979. These contracts are summarized in Figure 2. - Programs scheduled for FY 1979 are summarized in Figure 3. During the Subsidence Workshop held at Asilomar, October, 1978, recommendations for the revision of the Subsidence Management Plan were made. Figure 4 illustrates a suggested revision for the plan. The Geothermal Subsidence Research Program is directly responsive to the DOE/DGE goal of \"power-on-line.'' development can be reduced by utilization of techniques and tools developed through the GSRP. Operational methodology developed by the program can provide guidance to regulators and developers to prevent or minimize subsidence.

Donaldson Physics and Engineering Laboratory Department of Scientific and Industrial Research Lower Hutt, New Zealand Although nowadays much of the New Zealand geothermal reservoir research effort is still being concentrated on the older fields of Wairakei and Broadlands there has been a definite advance over recent years in our approach to the studies. On the practical side, long term reinjection trials are now in progress at Broadlands, and drilling, for field evaluation, is well underway at Ngawha, a field characterised by a steam discharge coupled with a hydrostatic pressure gradient. On the theoretical side, well pressure transient analysis and reservoir behaviour modeling are probably the primary interests. For the former both multi-element com- puter modeling programs and two-phase pressure diffusion analysis (Grant, 1978, Grant and Sorey, 1979) are being used by M.A.Grant, E.Bradford and F.Sutton (AMD*) and M.L.Sorey (PEL). Geometry and boundary influences are dominant and estimated steam flows are higher than are consistent with the Corey (1954) expressions for relative permeability. Both of these effects are probably due to the fracture permeability of the reservoirs. A.McNabb (AMD) is currently taking this into account by determining the response to discharge in a fracture -block medium. He is working with 100 metre blocks, consistent with data from lumped parameter mod -73s 2nd from well records, with a block permeability of 10 m. Reservoir behaviour modeling is probably the research area of greatest current interest with most research groups here involved to some extent. The models range over a wide spectrum, from extreme simplification to sophisticated detail. At the simpler extreme is the model of J.Elder (AU). This consists of two resistors and a condenser in electrical analog form but is coupled with models of the well system and the above surface plant to enable overall system effects and interactions to be assessed. L.Ju.Fradkin (PEL) is also working with one of the simpler models. This is one representing the gross field pressure behaviour with the equation -__--__-__---------- *The initials indicate the research groups, listed later, with whom these researchers are associated. -36- where p is a representative field pressure (for Wairakei at 58Om) at time t, p is the initia:L value of this pressure, q is the mass discgarge from the wells, and A, B and C are coefficients characterising the system. She is using field data and system identification methods to estimate these coefficients, as functions, and hence as variables with time, for Wairakei. Wooding (AMD) for the Tauhara fie:Ld, adjacent to and affected by Wairakei, and the detailed model of the two-phase zone of Broadlands bein set up on the computer by M.J.O'Sullivan and G.Zyvoloski (AUT . Sorey (PEL) is using both their technique and that of Mercer and Faust (1978) on local sections of geothermal reservoirs to check ideas and assumptions being put forward by other workers in this field. Among the more complicated models are those of R.A. They are first trying a horizontal section. It is to an intermediate model, however, that I wish to address the remainder of this paper. This is what is now generally here called the \"drainage\" model. I will concentrate on one recent variant of this model and will use the Wairakei reservoir as my example. The \"drainage\" model in Figure 1. In this the geothermal reservoir is pictured as a column of rock matrix saturated at depth with hot water but overlain in turn by columnar layers saturated with water - and steam and with cold water. This reservoir is assumed to be surrounded by, and directly connected with, the cooler outside water. There are thus no structural boundaries as such although some permeability variation is anticipated. The circular cylinder of the Figure is also purely illustrative. The shape of the actual column wi:L1 be defined by the reservoir and it may vary significantly from level to level. For the majority of the exercise only the integrated flows up the column are of interest, but horizontal flows and the pattern of vertical flow across the reservoir have been taken into account. The variant of this model discussed here is illustrated The history of this model is now somewhat shady as most New Zealand geothermal researchers can probably see some of their own previous work in its development. As a full drainage model, however, its appearance is only recent with its applic - ation to Wairakei by McNabb in 19;75. In that application the cold upper layer was not present and the two-phase layer was not treated in detail. Nonetheless a good match with the pressure drawdown in the Wairakei field was obtained. With its application to other geothermal reservoirs several variants on this basic model have evolved but for Wairakei the cooler upper layer has been added to permit the accounting for the quenching recently of the shallow well WK 107. It is hoped that it may also assist in explaining, quantitatively, the slow reduction in temperature of the main water zone of the reservoir. This is dropping in temperature by 1-2 C per year. 0 -37- The model reservoir in the undisturbed state assumed to enter the bottom of the hot water section 5 the reservoir at the rate M flux at this level and For Wairakei it would be 430 kg s- . This flow then moves up through the various layers to the surface. Under the assumed steady conditions the flow up through the lower water layer is isenthalpic, and hence, due to the small variation in enthalpy with pressure, virtually isothermal. at the two-phase/lower single -phase interface is defined and we may thus work back down from the surface to determine this level if so required. steam and the water at saturation conditions move up through the two-phase layer.' again under isenthalpic conditions until the influence of the cooler near surface water is encountered. Some cooling, and thus drop in enthalpy, will then take place and the boundary zone here will be somewhat diffuse. Beneath the zones of greatest cold water movement the cooling zone would be quite marked. Beneath zones of low movement, it is the heating of the water that would take precedence. In some areas, as evidenced by the surface manifestations of the system, the hot water and steam will continue right through to the ground surface. In the steady system, assuming no crossflow of the colder water, the fluid mass escape at the surface must match that entering at depth. In the undisturbed state hot water at enthalpy is (mass flux). This is the integrjated This means that the temperature, and hence the pressure, As cool water hydrostatic conditions apply both the The model reservoir under exploitation With the discharging of wells tapping the lower single - phase section of the reservoir, a local drop in pressure must occur. This pressure drop will, however, propagate quickly throughout this zone due to the low compressibility of the liquid water. Some pressure decay will thus soon occur at the side boundaries of the system and the gradient established here will result in the gradual incursion of cold outside water into the reservoir. This cold water will extract heat from the rock and a slowly thickening temperature front will thus begin to move in towards the wells. In a homogeneous system this frontal movement would be maximal at the well level and reduce as we move both above and below this level. With structure certain other levels may dominate. If the withdrawal is below the natural hot water influx, M,, this frontal movement will slowly decay and a new stable situation will develop. For higher discharges, however, the front must continue its inward movement . by McNabb (1975), I will concentrate here on the conditions above the main well production zone. As the temperature of this lower water system is set, the dr0.p in pressure due to the discharge must result in a drop in leve.1 of the boiling inter - face. In fact, it is the level of thi,s interface that, in effect,controls the pressures throughout the water zone. As this aspect of the process has already been documented -38- These pressures have dropped by about 26 bars since production commenced in 1953. gradient must decrease and although the upward vapour flow will be reduced relatively little, the upward water flow will quickly decrease. Surface manifestations are thus expected to become drier, although the total heat, controlled mainly by the steam flow, may not drop much. This is in fact what happened at Wairakei. With a higher discharge, however, the upward water flow in the two-phase zone will cease altogether and downward drainage of this water will commence. This drainage will have several effects.. It will supply water to the lower water zone and thus decrease the rate of pressure decay. It will extract some heat from the rock in the two- phase zone (even without the cool overlying water the water temperature decreases as we approach the surface). And it will either create some drier zones near the top of the layer or permit the cooler water from above to flow into the system. In Wairakei evidence suggests that both of these mechanisms are in progress invarious local regions. Some shallower wells, for example, became significantly drier over the years of exploitation, while well WK IO7 has been quenched. If this cooler water from above establishes preferred paths to the lower hot water system, and such preferred paths may only be the reverse of those previously established by the natural flow, the potential further exists for the cooling of this well water and the adjacent rock. Above this interface in the two-phase zone the pressure The Wairakei application On account of the apparent high degree of horizontal connection in the Wairakei geothermal reservoir, it is thought to be an ideal field for application of this model. In this case the three elements of the model, the upper and lower water zones and the intermediate two-phase one, are defined by their moving interfacial boundaries and hence can be treated independently, although interactively. In the lower water element the wells are assumed to act as a local three -dimensional sink and thus draw in fluid from all around. The base flow, M,, at some depth, is only minimally affected and the side flow is reduced in vertical extent by an assumption of an enhanced horizont.al permeability. In the initial exercise this enhancement is by a factor of IO. The interface between this layer and tlhe two-phase one above is, however, assumed horizontal. account. Well withdrawals are thus distributed horizontally and the other water/two-phase interface is also horizontal. It should be noted that at that interface the water temperature must be in excess of 100\u00b0C as the pressure must be above 1 bar. The upper layer thus transports soine heat. solutions being developed for the three zones. If the results are satisfactory, extension to the Broadlands system, in which In the other two layers only vertical flow is taken into This study is currently still in progress with analytic -39- vertical connection has already shown up in shallow reinjection tests, will probably have priority.

The Drahage Model. -41 - THE REPLACEMENT OF GEOTHERMAL RESERVOIR BRINE AS A MEANS OF REDUCING SOLIDS PRECIPITATION AND SCALE FORMATION by John C. Martin Chevron Oi 1 Fie1 d Research Company P. 0. Box 466, La Habra, CA 90631 I NT RO DUCT I ON A number of technical difficulties are encountered in producing geothermal energy from reservoirs containing brines with high concentrations of dissolved sol ids. The reduction in temperature and pressure associated with brine production results in the precipitation of solids which can form heavy scale in producing and injection wells and in surface equipment. Evidently under many conditions precipitates form in the reservoir surrounding producing wells, thereby reducing their productivity. some cases the precipitation of solids is so severe that it can prevent economic production. In This paper presents results of an investigation of the possibility of injecting a different water in a geothermal reservoir as a means of reducing problems caused by sol ids precipitation and scale formation. Corrosion problems may also be reduced depending upon the water -rock-metal behavior. The results are confined chiefly to reservoir mechanics, a logical first step in evaluating the process for a given reservoir. Water -rock chemistry, water treating, water supply, brine disposal and overall economics are discussed only briefly or are beyond the scope of this paper. In general the composition of water injected into geothermal reservoirs does not remain the same. the injected water tends to equilibrate with the reservoir rock. fresh water is injected it may pick up such minerals as silica, carbonate, iron, sulphur, etc. These minerals may precipitate and cause problems in producing the reservoir. Nevertheless, under suitable conditions, a change in the reservoir water may be an attractive alternative to cycling the original reservoir brine. In addition to Fixing with the original water If DISCUSSION Figures 1 and 2 illustrate one method of replacing the original reservoir brine with injected water. Figure 1 illustrates a single well injecting water. Region 1 contains injection water that has cooled the reservoir rock. rock and adjacent formations. high temperatures. Figure 2 i 1 lustrates cycl ing operations. injection well continues as an injection well and two producing wells produce hot injection water from Region 2. Region 2 contains injection water that has been heated by the Region 3 contains the original brine at The original An alternate method to that illustrated is to produce the reservoir heat by continuous water cycling. The original reservoir brine is produced but a different water is injected. This method may be particularly -42- attractive for very low porosity reservoirs in which many pore volumes of water are required to produce the heat by water cycling, The ratio of the volume of Region 1 to the volume of Regions 1 and 2 of Figures 1 and 2 is the ratio of the cold water volume to the injection water volume. This ratio is determined by the ratio of the velocity of the cold bank separating Regions 1 and 2 and the velocity of the injection water bank separating Regions 2 and 3. The velocity of the injection water bank, uf, is: w2 U Uf = Where @ is the porosity and uw2 is the volumetric flow rate of the hot injection water per unit cross section area. The relation for the velocity of the cold bank, uc, can be obtained by applying mass and heat balances across the cold bank Where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to Regions 1 and 2 respectively, and hr is the enthalpy of the solid portion of the rock hw is the enthalpy of the water pr is the density of the solid portion of the rock pw is the density of the water The desired ratio, uc/uf is (from equations 1 and 2) 1 U 'f 1 + (Y)N where (3) In most potential applications N lies between .5 and 1.0. Using the porosities found in oil and gas reservoirs as a guide, one would expect the porosities of geothermal reservoirs to vary from about .01 for some fractured reservoirs with no matrix porosity to about .35 for highly porous sandstone reservoirs. These ranges of N and 41 result in a range of uc/uf from about .01 to about .50. Thus, the volume of injection water may vary from about twice that of the cold water to perhaps as much as 100 times larger. -43- The proposed method of water injection appears favorable for low values of uc/uf. flushing the brine from the reservoir and replacing it with injection water might remove only a small fraction of the useful heat initially contained in the reservoir. The prospec:ts are much less favorable for highly porous reservoirs as illustrated by the example discussed in the fol 1 owing paragraphs. These low values correspond to low porosity reservoirs where Performance predictions were made for an idealized, uniform, two-dimensional, radially symmetric reservoir with the initial temperature distribution given in Figure 3-a. The calculations were made using a stream tube model in which the fluid mobility varies along the stream tubes as required by the temperature -viscosity re1 ation. A constant pressure difference of 1000 psi was maintained between injection and production wells, and a constant pressure outer boundary was assumed at a radial distance of 20,000 feet. No heat recharge was assumed, the change in water density was neglected, and heat conduction effects were ignored. Other parameters were : porosity .25, permeabi 1 i ty 500 md, uc/uf fixed at .257, and well bore radii of .46 feet;. Figure 3 presents the temperature distribution, the stream lines, the well patterns, and the injection water and the cold banks at various times. Continuous over-injection was maintained over most of the life of the reservoir in order to maintain a sufficiently wide region of hot injection water in which to locate the production wells. cold water breakthrough producing wells were either converted to injection wells or shut in until a more appropriate time to convert them to injectors. The production wells were located and operated so that none of the original brine was produced. In general, at The cumulative water injected and produced and the temperature of the produced water versus time are presented in Figure 4. The two sharp drops in temperature of the produced water during the first five years and the sharp drop during the twenty -fourth year are the result of cold water breakthrough into the production wells. The other three sharp temperature drops result from locating production wells in areas with lower temperatures. The gradual rises following these three drops are caused by higher temperatures being propagated outward from the center of the reservoir. The average injection rate per well per foot of interval during the first twenty -three years of production was 676 B/D/ft, and the average production rate was 633 B/D/ft.

Since well cost can be the dominant cost of geothermal reservoir development, the production of injection water heated by the geothermal reservoir as illustrated in this idealized example can add significantly to the production costs in a high porosity reservoi r. On the average only about 57% of the wells -44- The idealized two-dimensional model illust.rates some of the problems associated with high porosity reservoirs. the processes whereby injection water is heated within the reservoir and then produced should become more economical to apply for reservoirs with smaller porosities. water relative to the cold water regions. indicate that larger regions containing hot water allow more efficient use of wells. As pointed out previously, Smaller porosities are associated with smaller This indicates larger regions containing hot injected Of 'C'\"f. Results presented in Figure 3 CONCLUSIONS 1. Problems with solids precipitation and scale formation may be reduced in some geothermal reservoirs by replacing the original reservoir brine with fresh water or a water with a different dissolved solids content. 2. Injection of a water different from the original reservoir brine is particularly attractive for very low porosity reservoirs where many pore volumes of water are needed to produce the reservoir heat by water cycling.

Lockner, D. Bartz, and J. Byerlee U. S. Geological Survey 345 Middlefield Road Menlo Park, CA 94025 The useful lifetime of a geothermal reservoir as an energy source can depend strongly on the technique used to extract heat. occurring geothermal fields and artificial geothermal reservoirs, such as the Los Alamos hot dry rock experiment, continuous extraction of heat requires maintenance of a channel of permeable material to and away from the heat source. Since such a system must be recharged to maintain production over a useful period of time, water must be heated and thus transported through rock in the presence of large temperature gradients. In both naturally We have designed experiments to study permeability changes in rock due to fluid flow along a temperature gradient to further understanding of how heat production in geothermal reservoirs may depend on these effects. samples of Westerly Granite, 8.9 cm long, 7.6 cm in diameter, and containing a 0.56 cm diameter borehole, were used. A resistance heater was placed in the borehole as a heat source, giving a radially symmetric temperature gradient. Confining pressure and pore pressure were applied to the sample; a pore Cylindrical -50- pressure gradient was applied to induce radial flow either toward or away from the borehole. the experiments, an apparent permeability, averaged over the whole sample, was calculated from Darcy's Law by measuring the pore fluid flow rate. Although permeability may not have remained homogeneous during Figure 1 shows the results of two experiments with samples of Westerly Granite; experimental conditions are given in Table I.

In experiment 11, pore fluid flowed toward the borehole. In this experiment, the decrease in permeability may likewise have been due to deposition of dissolved minerals. solubility of silica as a function of temperature goes through a maximum between 320' and 34OOC. it must deposit silica on heating as it moves t,oward the borehole, thus At pressures below 300 bars the If the pore fluid is saturated at this temperature, -51 - decreasing the permeability. Permeabili.ty may also have been decreased in both experiments I and I1 by alteration of minerals in place, resulting in clogging of pores. Further experiments are being conducted to determine the relative importance of these two effects. These results suggest that under the proper conditions, fluid flowing through rock along a temperature gradient can result in decreased permeability. Although this effect is undesirable in geothermal applications, it may be of use in the disposal of nuclear waste materials. In this case, transportation of nucleides away from the hot disposal site by ground water may be inhibited by decreases in the permeability. The experiments reported here were designed to show that permeability can be decreased by fluid flow. We are currently conducting experiments to study the conditions under which permeability can be increased by fluid flow. When this problem is thoroughly understood, it should be possible to design geothermal heat extraction systems so as to take advantage of these effect:; and thereby improve energy production. -52- 1000 100 h 0 -0 c v t- I- _I - - m a W 3 IT W a W c3 IZT W > a a IO I EXPERIMENT I EXPERIMENT II 0 400 80 0 TIME (sec x 1000) I200 FIG. 1.

N. Herkelrath and A. F. Moench U. S. Geological Survey . Menlo Park, Calif. 94025 Introduction Transient flow of noncondensable gas in porous materials has been thoroughly investigated, and good agreement between the gas-flow equation and experiments has been reported in the petroleum -engineering literature (Wallick and Aronofsky, 1954). computer simulations of pressure -transient behavior in vapor -dominated geothermal steam reservoirs (e.g. , Moench and Herkelrath, 1978). This theory has been widely used in However, few laboratory experiments involving steam flow in porous materials have been reported. gas-flow theory to steam flow, we developed a laboratory system to investigate the transient flow of steam through unconsolidated porous materials. a step change in gas pressure at one end of a cylinder of porous material , and measuring the pressure as a function of time at the other end. Apparatus In order to test the applicability of the Pressure -transient experiments were carried out by imposing A schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus is shown in figure 1. The steam -flow system was enclosed in an oven which had a temperature uniformity of 50.5OC. All components, including valves and pressure transducers, operated at high temperatures inside the oven to avoid temperature gradients and steam condensation in the system. The sample holder consisted of stainless steel pipe in which unconsolidated porous materials were densely packed. The results reported here were obtained with a pack of the 0.053 mn to 0.125 mn sieved fraction of a nat ral desert sand. The bulk density and porosity of the sample were 1.7 g/cm Y and 0.32, respectively. Steam was obtained by boiling pure water or CaC12 brine stored in a large reservoir inside the oven. At any given temperature the steam pressure above the liquid in the reservoir was approximately equal to the vapor pressure of the solution. Pressure -transient tests were also run with air or nitrogen gas which was supplied from a pressure regulating system outside the oven. In the experiments reported here, the sample was brought to a low initial pressure, and then a constant higher gas or steam pressure was applied at the top of the sample by opening the appropriate pneumatic valve. wi th pressure transducers during the resul ti ng pressure bui 1 dup. The pressure at both ends of the sample was measured continuously -54- Results shown in figure 2. .one-dimensional gas-flow equation (Aronofsky, 1954) : Typical pressure buildup curves obtained in the experiment are Results of tests with air agreed well with the In equation 1, P is the gas pressure, Z is the distance from the top of the sample, p is the fluid viscosity, 4 is the sample porosity, K is the intrinsic permeability, and t is the time. A good fit to the air pressure buildup data was obtained by assuming a permeability of 3.0 Darcys in the theoretical calculations. However, when the same pressure boundary conditions were imposed using steam as the fluid, large time delays in the pressure response were observed. The time required for pressure buildup was increased by as much as a factor of thirty. the curves for air buildup and steam buildup at 100\u00b0C in figure 2. A fit to the standard theory could only be obtained by assuming an unreasonably low permeability of 0.1 Darcy. Di scuss ion This is illustrated by comparing The delayed pressure response was probably caused by condensation. Despite the fact that the steam pressure was less than the saturation vapor pressure throughout the experiment, condensation occurred in the sample. A liquid saturation as high as three percent by volume was measured by weighing the sample at the end of pressure -transient runs. Condensation of the steam probably occurred because the vapor pressure of liquid water in a porous medium is reduced. lowering \" effect, comnonly observed in soil systems, is caused by adsorption and gas-liquid interface curvature in the small pores of the medium. The dependence of the liquid saturation in the sample upon vapor pressure was determined at high temperature by allowing the sample to equilibrate with salt solutions of known vapor pressure in the reservoir. The results of these tests are shown in figure 3. Also shown for comparison are room temperature data published by Westcot and Wierenga (1974). This \"vapor -pressure - When condensation occurs, a sink term for steam should be added to equation 1 to preserve the mass balance.

Estimates of the sink term indicate that .it is one to two orders of magnitude larger than the compressibility term. way results in an increase in the predicted response time which is of the same order of magnitude as found in the experiments. because of errors in the determination of system parameters, good quantitative agreement between the modified theory and the experimental results has not yet been achieved. t Accounting for condensation in this However, possibly Re fe re nces Aronofsky, J, S., 1954, Effect of gas slip on unsteady flow of gas through porous media: Journal of App1,ied Physics, v. 25, p. 48-53.

Danesh and H.J. Ramey, Jr. Department of Petroleum Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305 The Stanford Geothermal Project bench-scale experiments are designed to improve the understanding of geothermal reservoir physics. Three sets of experiments are discussed in the following sections: (1) vapor pressure lowering in porous media due to capillarity and adsorption, (2) the effect of temperature on absolute permeability, and (3) the determination of steam-water relative permeability for drainage processes. Vapor Pressure Lowering Vapor pressure lowering in porous media may be important to both reserve evaluation and geothermal - reservoir performance predic- tion. Vapor pressure lowering is a lowering of the vapor pressure curve. As shown schematically in Fig. 1, it occurs at low water saturations. The lowering may be caused by (1) capillarity, i,e.? curved liquid -vapor interfaces in porous media and/or by (2) surface adsorption of fluid molecules at the solid-fluid interface. It is believed that capillary effects occur at low water saturations, but that vapor pressure lowering is minor until saturations are so low that adsorption phenomena dominate (Hsieh et al., 1978). The importance of vapor pressure lowering is further demon- strated by the following hypothetical situation. If the temperature and pressure of a geothermal reservoir are determined to be that of point A in Fig. 1, a reservoir engineer may use the flat surface vapor presslire curve and assume the reservoir is 100% dry steam and contains no liquid water. In actual practice, further lowering of reservoir pressure may allow capillary or adsorbed water to vaporize. Thus, both the reserves and the rate of production are increased beyond that pre- dicted wi.th the assumption of no vapor pressure lowering (and no liquid water saturation). The fol loving calculation demonstrates th possible importance 5 of surface adsorptiz . 7.9.5 m pore volume.

However, it is expected that at each temperature level studied, results will demonstrate multilayer adsorption \"plateaus\" as shown in Fig. 3. To better understand the adsorption phenomena and to try to estimate the number of adsorption layers, the BET cell shown in Fig. 4 has already been used to determine nitrogen surface areas of consoli- dated sandstones (Berea) and unconsolidated sand packs. These studies may be extended to include natural gas adsorption phenomena as they occur in natural gas reservoirs. The experimental apparatus required for this study is now as- Vapor pressure lowering will be determined as a function of Effect of Temperature on Absolute Permeabil9 Experimental results of Weinbrandt (1972), Cas& (1974), Aruna (19761, and others suggest the absolute permeability of sandstones and unconsolidated sands to water is reduced up to 65% at elevated temperatures and confining pressures. Permeability reductions with increased temperature were not observed for: nitrogen, oil, or octonol. In addition, permeability reduction was not: observed for water flow- , ing through limestone. Recently, Dr. A. Danesh, visiting professor from Abadan Institute of Technology, Iran, performed additional experi- ments flowing water and oil through unconsolidated sand and unconsolidated stainless steel. His results were similar to those of Cassi and hruna, but similar reductions in permeability also occurred for unconsolidated stainless steel (Danesh et al., 1978). Subsequent experiments were recently completed using water and either unconsolidated sand or limestone ground and sieved to a similar mesh size. effects. The reason the results were different may be due to a dif- ferent experimental procedure. In particular, waterwas pumped through the care during the entire experiment. In the earlier experiments, water nay not have flowed through the core during heating and cooling between measurements at different temperatures. layer, intermolecular force mechanism, as suggested by Danesh to explain the permeability reductions, ma)' indicate that such pro- cedural differences are important. Future experiments will attempt to verify Danesh's conclusions. These experiments did not reproduce the temperature level The solid-liquid boundary Stean-Water Relative Permeability Steam and liquid relative permeabilities, expressed as a function of liquid saturation, are required in the numerical models used to calculate mass and energy recovery from two-phase geothermal reservoirs. Currently, modified Corey-type equztions are used because adequate tech- niques for detemining proper stsarn-wat2r relative permeabilities are still under development. Relative permeabilities are oftsn expressed as equations for convenience. -61 - Sufficient data can be obtained from steady, two-phase, non- isothermal flow experiments to allow the construction of steam-water relative permeability curves for a drainage process. Water satura- tion can be measured with a capacitance probe (Chen et al., 1978). A preliminary relative permeability curve is shown in Fig. 5. The data has not been corrected for temperature or Klinkenberg slip effects, and the core has not yet been analyzed for nonhomogeneity caused by possible hydrothermal alteration. In addition, isothermal nitrogen-displacing -water experiments were performed to provide gas-water drainage relative permeabilities at a variety of temperatures. These gas-water relative permeabilities provide an interesting comparison to the steam-water relative permea- bilities. One example is shown in Fig. 6. Data analysis is not yet complete, and differences between the two curves have not yet been explained. Stewart et al. (1953) has stated that gas-expansion and gas drive drainage relative permeabilities are identical for hydro- carbons in homogeneous sandstone cores. For this reason, the steam- water and the nitrogen-water experiments are expected to yield similar, and possibly identical, results. Future effort will focus on refining the quality of data obtained from these two types of experiments.

Drilling of such Dual-phase flow is directed by the fractures of the reservoir; energy extinction is mainly determined by heat and mass transfers between the rock and the fluids. A large part of the energy stored in the reservoir is the heat of the rock, so the knowledge of these two interconnected mechanisms is very important to appreciate the behavior of geothermal res- ervoirs.

Experimental Apparatus (Fig. 1) The simulation of auto vaporization phenomena was made on a simple geometrical shape of the porous medium in which heat and mass transfers are mono -directional. The experimental installation was set up with the following: 1. A cylindrical cell P = 10.5 bars. The problem of the conciliation of good performances in pressure and low thermic perturbations caused by the envelope in contact with the porous medium was solved by using two concentric tubes, the in- ternal in epoxy resin and the external induraluminum. The external tube can be heated by electric resistances controlled by an electronic regula - tion chain which can work at two levels: It allows the average thermodynamic conditions of T = 180\u00b0C and 0 in relation with a fixed temperature to obtain a regular heating of the porous medium, or 0 to minimize the gap of temperature between the axis of the porous medium and the exterior. The heat losses in this position can be assumed to be equal to zero. 2. Fluid alimentation It is made by a nitrogen -pressurized reservoir containing a deform - able envelope. Water goes to the ends of the cylindrical cell through porous plaques. circulation. 3. Fluid production condensor. This condensor allows the access to the enthalpy of the pro- duced fluid. 4.

Porosity The fraction produced in vapor phase is more important at low porosity (Fig. 2). However, with the horizontal configuration the total massic -produced fraction is not affected by porosfty. The fact that the enthalpy of produced fluids is better at low porosity shows clearly the importance of the solid matrix heat in the vaporization process. 2.

However, it is nearly always better practice, with nonlinear diffusion equations, to represent the divergence terms exactly (here V m). The errors incurred by ignoring the variations in K seem less important. A rough reason can be advanced. Both (5) and (2) are valid if the pressure changes are small. But (5) is also valid for steady pressure changes of any magnitude. If a bore is running for a long time, there is a quasi -steady 2 region near the bore. The approximation (5) may better repre - sent this, for large drawdowns, than (2). It should be noted that the pseudopressure defined here 3 does not have the dimensions of pressure, but pp/p (= kg/m s). Conventional gas pseudopressures are differently defined. Such a pseudopressure for superheated steam is given by Atkinson and Mannon (1977). The boundary conditions are also scaled.

At 145.5OC, compressional velocity increased from steam -saturated (low pore pressure) to water -saturated (high pore pressure) rock, whereas shear wave velocity decreased. Further - more, a velocity minimum, attenuation and dispersions occur at water -steam transition for compressional wave. Results at 198\u00b0C show that both com- pressional and shear velocities decrease from steamsaturated to water - saturated rock, and a small velocity minimum is observed for compressional waves, but no attenuation nor dispersion occur. At both temperatures, the V /V ratio and Poisson's ratio increased from steam -saturated to water - PS saturated rock. The results are reasonably compatible with the mechanical effects of mixing steam and water in the pore space near the phase transition, and may be applicableto in situ geothermal field evaluation. -84- INTRODUCTION One of the methods of exploration for geothermal resources is seismic surveying, including microearthquake studies, V /V ratios, and seismic wave attenuation. However, few laboratory measurements of velocity of rocks at high tem- PS perature with hot water or steam have been made (e.g., Spencer and Nur, 1976). It is important therefore to extend our knowledge of velocities in water-filled rocks at high temperature with an emphasis of difference be- tween the liquid (water) and gas (vapor) phase of pore fluid, which we have done in this study. and shear V temperatures, as the water in the pores is converted to steam and steam to water, with particular attention to the effects of the phase transition it- self. Specifically, we have measured both compressional V velocities and wave amplitudes in porous rock at geothermal P S From the velocities, we also computed Poisson's ratio. Experimental Procedure The basic method used is the measurement of pulse travel time through rock samples with pore water. At fixed temperature, we vary the pore pres- sure P back and forth across the transition from steam (low P ) to water (high P ). 189OC, were taken from Keenan et al., 1969. P P 0 The transition pressures for the temperatures used,145.5 C and P Ultrasonic compressional and shear wave velocities and amplitudes were measured by the conventional pulse transmission method, with a mercury delay line as a reference. 1 MHz PZT ceramic transducers were used for generating compressional and shear waves. -85- Results We measured both compressional and shear wave velocities at a con- stant con\u20acining pressure (300 bar) and temperature (19.5OC, 145.5OC, and 189OC) as a function of pore pressure. The pore pressure was changed from high pore pressure to low pore pressure (decreasing pore pressure cycle) and then increased again (increasing pore pressure cycle). Varying the pore pressure over the range of 7.0 bars in a saturated sample at 19.5 C produced almost no changes in either V or V . 0 P S In contrast, marked changes of velocities, Poisson's ratios, and wave amplitudes with changing pore pressure were observed at the higher tem- peratures of 145.5OC and 198OC. The results show: (1) There is a minimum for compressional velocity at pore pressure of 4 bar (Fig. 2) which is very close to the water-vapor transition pressure of 4.212 bar at 145.5OC (Keenan et al. 1969). Below this pore pressure, water is in vapor phase (steam) and above the transition pressure it is in liquid phase. No minimum is observed for shear wave velocity (Fig. 3). (2) Compressional wave velocity of steam-filled rock is lower than that of water-filled rock. Shear wave velocity in steam-filled rock is higher than that of water-filled rock. (3) Poisson's ratio and V /V ratio calculated from compressional and PS shear wave velocities increase from steam-saturated to water-saturated rock, as shown in Fig. 4. -86- (4) We observe changes of wave amplitude vs pore pressure (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). at the water-vapor transition, which is reproducible with pore pressure We notice a sharp drop in the compressional wave amplitude cycling. However, no minimum of shear wave amplitude is observed. In Fig. 5, the time intervals from first arrival to the first, second, and third peaks are plotted vs pore pressure with a large time interval cor- responding to lower frequency of the wave. Again the water-steam transi- tion, a peak time interval, was observed for compressional wave but not for shear wave. compressional wave are significantly more attenuated at the water-vapor transition. This suggests that high frequency components of the Because attenuation depends so sensitively on many factors, and be- cause the sample length is short, we cannot yet calculate exact Q values for these data. Nevertheless, it is obvious that attenuation and disper- sion occur at the water-steam transition in our rock sample for compres- sional waves, but not for shear waves. CONCLUSION We have studied experimentally the nature of wave propagation in steam-, water-, and mixture-saturated sandstone. The results show that the P wave velocity is abnormally low in the. phase transition region at 145OC and 198 C, whereas the shear velocity has no minimum there. ratio undergoes a marked increase upon the transition from the steam- saturated to water-saturated state. also has a strong minimum at the transition region, whereas the S ampli- tude does not. 0 Poisson's The amplitude of the P wave at 145OC -87- All these results can be explained by the effects of a mixture of steam, vapor, and water in the pores at the transition conditions: for a few percent steam, the density of the mixture is relatively high, similar - to water, whereas the bulk modulus, K, is low, similar to steam. The shear velocity, which is insensitive to the bulk modulus of the fluid in- clusion, is therefore barely influenced, whereas the compressional velocity is sensitive to E, and thus undergoes a measurable change. the large relative P attenuation at the transition is probably due to local flow in the partially saturated state. Furthermore, The results of this study suggest that in situ interfaces between steam and hot water, if they exist, may be recognizable using the seismic method. Furthermore, regions with both steam and hot water should exhibit anomalous low velocity and high attenuation of P waves, but not of S waves. Further- more, Poisson's ratio is, as expected, a good discriminator between steam and hot water in the pore space and may be a useful tool, as suggested in previous work (e.g., Combs and Rotstein, 1976) on the basis of room tem- perature measurements. The data presented here demonstrate that the con- clusion is valid also at temperatures anticipated in a geothermal area.

Truesdell, U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, Calif. George A. Frye, Aminoil U.S.A., Santa Rosa, Calif. Manuel Nathenson, U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, Calif. Introduction columns either when first drilled or when produced at low flow rates. These water columns have been attributed by Lipman et al. (1978) to accumulation of water condensing in the well bore. Alternative explanations are that perched water bodies exist within the reservoir or that a deep water body underlying the steam reservoir has been tapped. A well in the Castle Rock field of The Geysers drilled by Signal Oil and Gas Company (now Aminoil, U.S.A.) with such a water column was sampled in 1976 for water, gas, and isotope chemistry in hopes of distinguishing between these possible origins; the results along with the well history and downhole pressure and temperature measurements are reported here. Certain wells within The Geysers steam field have standing water The well is located in Lake County, California, in the central part of the Castle Rock field, 4.8 km west-northwest of the town of Anderson Springs. Drilling was started in mid 1970 on a ridge at an elevation of 700 m above sea level. Steam entries were encountered at depths (below land surface) of 1,899, 1,902, 2,176, 2,248 2,288, and 2,295 m; the total depth drilled was 2,498 m. Large volume water entries above 685 m were cased off to 762 m. Downhole Measurements year from 1973 to 1977. During that period the well was held at a small bleed flow through a 2.5-cm orifice, except during short (usually less than 8 hour) performance tests. The results of the downhole surveys are shown in figures 1 and 2. In each of these surveys standing water was found in the well below a vapor zone. Temperatures and pressures above the water level generally decreased with time, and the level of water in the well rose. The pressure in the water zone was remarkably constant at each depth and the pressure and temperature near the bottom of the well at 2,484 m remained at 53.6 20.3 bars and 247.7 21.6OC from 1973 to 1976. (Measurements in 1977 were not made below 2,164 m.) The variations of pressure and temperature at this depth are well within the expected instrumental reproducibility of 22% of full range or 20.8 bars and r2.2OC. Static downhole pressure and temperature surveys were made each Above the level of standing water the measurements indicate the presence of vapor (steam + gas). Below 610 m in this vapor zone the temperatures were those expected for steam-water saturation at the measured pressures within less than 20.7OC in 1973, 1974, and 1977, with larger differences (to 2.7OC) in 1975 and 1976 possibly due to instrumental error. probably due to accumulation of gas. The pressure gradients (near 0.17 bars/100 m) were also close to those calculated for columns of Above 610 m the temperature differences increased -96- saturated steam except in 1976 and 1977 when the observed gradients were almost twice those calculated. produced by accumulation of nearly 100% C02 in the well but this was not observed in the chemical samples. surface were slightly higher due to gas accumulation. These high gradients could be Pressure gradients near the Below the water level, pressure gradients were equal to those calculated for pure water; and temperatures, although greater than in the vapor zone, were much lower than those expected for saturation at the observed pressures indicating absence of steam. Pressures and temperatures in the water zone were remarkably constant despite large changes in the vapor zone above. that the physical conditions within the well were controlled by the reservoir away from the well. The temperature at the well bottom is close to that at similar depths in Castle Rock wells without standing water and similar to the temperature at the bottom of the vapor zone in 1973 (at 2,270 m). Pressures at 2,286 m have remained at 3820.3 bars, close to field pressures \u20acor this depth as observed or extrapolated from other wells without standing water. This suggests These observations suggest that steam enters the well from the deepest observed steam entries (at 2,290? m) and the pressure in the water column is controlled at this depth by the pressure of steam outside the well. Temperatures at this point have been below the field average for this depth after 1973 but pressure communication could be maintained even if the formation cooled off locally. The standing water may be local to the well or could represent the top of a more extensive water body. Nearby wells did not enounter water but were not drilled to as great a depth. Redrilling of this well to 2,714 m in early 1977 did not encounter any deeper steam zones nor did it greatly affect the water level when measured in May 1977. This suggests that the rocks drilled were impermeable or that the water, if perched, extends at least to 2,71.4 m. The cooling off of the well and the accumulation of gas in the upper 600 meters both suggest that a large proportion of the steam flowing up the well is condensing in the well bore and flowing down the well. This is the probable origin of the water in the well, although this water may have mixed with water of a larger water zone. The continuing decrease in temperature and pressure in the well suggest that steam entry to the well at its normally low flow rate was not sufficient to maintain reservoir pressure and temperature conditions in the well and that condensed water continued to flow away from the well. During a full flow test the accumulated water clogging the steam entries (probably near 2,290 m) was expelled and steam access was sufficient to temporarily heat the well bore. period of rest after testing may explain the inconsistently high downhole pressures and temperatures measured in 1976. A shorter Collection and testing on March 9, 1976. Samples of condensed steam, gas, and expelled water were collected during a flow test on March 9, 1976.

This The samples were taken on bleed -97- ejected water was sampled at the lip of the horizontal silencer before it stopped flowing at about 1:15 p.m. ejected from the well at 3:30 p.m. and sampled at 4:OO p.m. Again the flow lasted only a short time. had been initially wet and opaque at the mouth of the silencer became gradually drier and more transparent. slug of water the steam was again opaque. and gas were taken 15 minutes before the flow was increased and 2-1/4 and 4-1/4 hours afterwards. Chemical and isotopic analyses of steam condensate and ejected water (along with earlier condensate analyses from Aminoil Laboratories) are shown in table 1 and gas analyses in table 2. A second slug of water was Throughout the test the steam which During ejection of the second Samples of steam condensate Water Analyses The condensate analyses show that compared to bleed steam, full flow steam contained higher concentrations of chemical constituents more soluble in liquid (Cl, B, NH4) and lower concentrations of constituents more soluble in vapor (C02 as HCO3, H2S). These observations are consistent with partial condensation during bleed and removal of liquid-soluble constituents to the water draining down the well bore and concentration of gas-soluble constituents in the bleed steam. The ejected water was much higher than either condensate in most salts because salts are only slightly soluble in steam at these pressures. The salts contained in the ejected water could all have been leached from reservoir rock and their concentrations are quite consistent with this water originating as steam condensate rather than from the deep brine body which has been hypothesized to underlie the field. The second slug of ejected water was more concentrated in most constituents than the first slug suggesting a longer period of rock leaching. stagnant water below the main steam entry to the well. have been ejected when a deeper steam passage was cleared and steam entered the well at a lower point. Gas Analyses The gas/steam molal ratio of the bleed steam (1/1,720) was much lower than that of full flow steam (%1/4,500, table 2). This is consistent with partial condensation of steam in the well bore when the well is on bleed flow. If it is assumed that negligible condensation occurs on full flow and that the amount of gas dissolved in the liquid water is negligible it is possible to calculate the relative amounts of steam condensing and flowing out of the well near the bottom and of steam (and entrained water) flowing out at the wellhead when the well is on bleed. ratios suggest that 40% of the total steam is leaving at the top of the well with 60% condensing and flowing down and out at the bottom. It is possible that this slug represented relatively This water may Calculations from the gas/H2O Hydrogen and oxygen isotopes. Oxygen-18 and deuterium were measured in the condensates from bleed and full flow steam and in the ejected water (table 1 and figure 3). The isotopic composition of the ejected water appears to bear little relation to the calculated composition of water condensed in the well bore and the second sample appears to have been in isotopic equilibrium with full flow steam at 95OC. It is suggested that the -98- isotopic composition of the ejected wtater was rapidly altered in the silencer at temperatures near surface boiling (97OC at this altitude) by exchange with steam blowing over it. This alteration was partial when the first sample was collected and complete when the second sample was collected. The ratio of change in oxygen-18 to the change in deuterium for bleed versus full flow steam indicates partial isothermal separation of steam and water at about 25OoC (figure 3). This suggests that the temperature of separation between steam entering the well and liquid water leaving it is close to the reservoir temperature, and is consistent with the pressure control mechanism suggested earlier of a steam entry at 2,290 m from the main reservoir initially at 247OC. The precision of the deuterium measurement is not however sufficient to indicate the temperature of separation to better than 525OC so this slope is consistent with separation at the temperatures observed in the well. The isotopic changes can also be used to calculate the fraction of steam leaving the wellhead and the fraction condensing and draining down the well. Assuming that the bleed steam may actually have some entrained water, the initial flow of saturated steam divides into three streams. Part of the steam remains vapor and flows out of the well; part of the steam condenses to liquid water and is entrained in the bleed steam and leaves the well with it; and finally, part of the steam condenses to liquid water and flows down the well and out into the formation. Applying conservation of energy to this process including the effects of wellbore heat loss (Ramey, 1962), the enthalpy of the bleed steam may be determined as a function of m/ms(o) where m is the mass flow rate! of bleed steam and entrained condensate out of the well and ms(0) is the mass flow rate of saturated steam into the well at the bbttom. If the enthalpy of the bleeding mixture were known, this ratio could be determined directly. The enthalpy was not measured, but this energy balance provides upper and lower bounds on the ratio m/ms(0). discharge must be between that for saturated liquid and saturated vapor at 230 to 24OoC, and these bounds constrain m,/ms(0) to be between 0.42 and 0.74 for the bleed steam and between 1.0 and 0.90 for the full flow steam. The enthalpy of the bleeding Isotopic fractionation of oxygen-18 and deuterium between the steam flow and the condensing water filows may also be modeled by writing conservation of mass (steam up, water up and down), conservation of isotopes in those flows, and the equilibrium fractionation factors between water and steam (Truesdell, et al., 1977). of feed steam from the measured compositions of surface bleed steam and water as a function of the ratio of mass of bleed flow to initial mass flow of steam m/ms(0). D/H) two curves are shown on figure 4 for the compositions of feed steam derived from the measured isotopic composition of bleed steam and water, one for assumed fractionat:ion at 230% and one for 24OoC.

For deuterium, the two sets of measurements are only consistent for an assumed 24OoC fractionation temperature. have, however, standard deviations of This large error compared to oxygen-18 measurements, means that the failure of consistency for deuterium values at 23OOC is hardly significant. The ratio of 55% of the inlet mass of steam being produced by the bleeding well is in reasonable agreement with a value of 40% based on the gas analyses and with the 42% to 74% indicated by heat transfer calculations.

Pressures and temperatures in the standing water suggest pressure communication with the steam reservoir at a point below the standing water level. Limited inflow of steam and outflow of condensed water has allowed the well bore and surrounding rock to decrease markedly in temperature and pressure over the period 1973-1977. Chemical analyses of condensate and ejected liquid water show significant differences, although ejected water also appears to originate as steam condensate. Standing water in a Geysers steam well has been shown from Gas and isotopic analyses of bleed and full flow steam agree with heat transfer calculations that indicate that about half of the steam entering the well during bleed flow is condensed in the well bore. We conclude that the chemical and isotopic composition of steam collected from this well and probably also from other wells on bleed is dominated by condensation and phase separation in the well and only full flow steam can be clearly related to field conditions.

Strobe1 Union Oil Company of California Santa Rosa, California SUMMARY During testing of a steam well at The Geysers steam field in Sonoma County, California, rate suddenly dropped by 17,500 lb/hr and wellhead pressure simultaneously increased by 30 psi. was no evidence of plugging in any of the surface facilities downstream of the wellhead. Pressure buildup tests before and after the incident show that there was a 15% reduction in permeability -thickness. Analysis of pressure losses in the wellbore due to friction showed that all of the rise in wellhead pressure could be explained by the reduction in mass flow that occurred as a result of the 15% reduction in kh. The change in wellhead enthalpy from 1200 Btu/lb and 4O-5'F superheat incident to 1197 Btu/lb and 0-1.4OF superheat after the incident indicates the well became slightly wet. explanation for this reduction in kh is that movement of free water caused a plugging action or a reduction of mobility to steam in one or more steam entries. There One possible -1 06- STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM On the first day of testing, the well was produced for 8.5 hours with a final rate of 195,640 lb/hr at 168 psig wellhead pressure. The following day this well was re-tested (see Table 1). After 5 hours, with the well producing 194,466 lb/hr at 174 psig, wellhead pressure suddenly jumped up 30 psi and rate dropped to 177,000 lb/hr. This was observed by personnel on site at the time. Inspection of test tube, orifice, throttlinq valve and muffler did not reveal any evidence of pluqqing. dav of testing, this well was re-tested at 172 psig wellhead pressure for 8.3 hours and final production rate was 171,000 lb/hr, indicating that there had been a permanent loss of about 13% in productivity. This test data is on Table 2. On the third Analysis of pressure buildup tests prior to and after the incident described above shows that there was a 15% loss in permeability- thickness, which is sufficient to account for all of the loss in productivity. The first buildup test, Figure 1, was done after flowing the well for 8.5 hours at 195,640 lb/hr on the first day of testing. The kh product calculated from this test was 75,000 md-ft. second day of testing, Table 1. A seco:nd buildup, Figure 2, was recorded after flowing for 8.3 hours at 171,000 lb/hr on the third day of testing, Table 2. The kh product calculated from this test was only 63,400 md-ft, 15% lower than w:hat it was prior to the loss in productivity. The loss in productivity occurred while flowinq on the , -1 07- REASON FOR RISE IN FLOWING PRESSURE Normally when wellhead pressure rises suddenly as rate drops off, plugging action downstream of the wellhead is commonly thought to be the cause. This case study shows that the same thing can happen in a steam well if there is a sudden plugging action in the the formation. Wellhead pressure rises because there is less friction drop at the lower rate. This was verified by friction drop calculations using the Cullender and Smith' equation. Results of this calculation, summarized below, show that friction loss dropped from 199 psi at the higher rate to 155 psi at the lower rate, and that static head (i.e. the gradient due to vapor density changes) increased from 34 psi to 38 psi for a net decrease of 40 psi in the vertical pressure gradient. The change in formation permeability caused bottomhole flowing pressure to be 10 psi lower at the lower rate. The 40 psi decrease in flowing pressure gradient was therefore reflected at the surface as a 30 psi rise in flowing wellhead pressure.

The sudden change in enthalpy along with the reduction in reservoir permeability strongly suggests that water influx may have caused a reduction in mobility to steam at one or more steam entries. , -109- Time min 70 85 115 145 17 5 220 280 310 Wellhead Pressure Psig 182 188 172 172 172 172 174 204 Wellhead Time Pressure 75 173 150 172 min wig 240 360 172 172 480 174 TABLE 1 SECOND FLOW TEST Enthalpy OF 4 3.4 3.3 3.3 3.3 4.3 3.4 5.0 TABLE 2 THIRD FLOW TEST -110- 300 I I I I I Ill1 I I I I I Ill I I I I IIIII I I I I IIII IO O1 I 280 100 FIGURE I PRESSURE BUILDUP TEST BEFORE THE PRODUCTIVITY IMPAIRMENT %I. 00 .a 240 Flow Rate = 195,640 Flowing Time 8.5 hrs. t +At At I b./hr.

Moench Water Division 345 Middlefield Road Menlo Park, CA 94025 IJ. S .- Gcol ogical Survey Int rodgction --_ analysis of steam-pressure behavior in a vapor -dominated geothemal reservoir with an immobile vapori.zing liquid phase was presented by Moench and Atkinson (1977) at the Third Stanford Woxkshop on Geothermal Reservoir Engineering, and later expanded by Moench and Atkinson (1978). In that study a finite -difference model was used to demonstrate the effects of phase change in the reservoir upon pressure drawdown sild buildup. In this paper that model is modified to incorporate heat transfer from blocks of impermeable rock to thin, highly -permeable, porous fissures. Tine purpose of this study is to demonstrate the added effect of heat tracsfer of this type upon the transient pressure response of a vapor -dominated geothermal reservoir. Hypothetical Model In the present study the vapor -dominated reservoir is assumed to be composed of a random assortment of highly permeable, porous fissures separated by blocks of impermeable rock, as illustrated in figure la. The fissures and blocks are initially at the same constant temperature throughout. With the onset of well discharge, pressure reductions induce vaporization of liquid water within the fissures. The resulting temperature decline induces transfer of heat by conduction from the adjacent blocks. In order to make the problem mathematically tractable, the conceptual model is idealized as shown in figure lb. Alternating layers of fissures and blocks of constant thickness are assumed to extend in the radial direction to infinity. The thickness of the impermeable block is assumed to represent the average thickness of the blocks in the actual reservoir. The fissures are assumed to be filled initially with a uniform distribution of liquid water and steam at a fixed saturated -vapor pressure. The initial water content of the fissure is sufficiently low that changes in saturation do not appreciably change the permeability to steam. Well discharge and fissure permeability, porosity, and thermal properties are assumed constant to simplify interpretation of the results. -1 12- It is also assumed, as in the model of Mocncli and Atkinson (1378), that stcam and 1Jqui.d \\;,iter in the fissure arc in local thermal cquilibri uin with tho solid material in the fissure and tilat effects of vapor-pressure lowering arc n&gliglblc. Effccts of the latter type were considercd by Plocnch and Ilcrlcel r,ith (19 78) . Theoretical equations for the flow of steam through porous reservoirs in the presence of inimobile vapori zing or condensing liquid water are gJven by Noeiicli and Atkinson (1978), In that study it was assumed that the only temperature changes to occur in the reservoir are those due to vaporization or condrnsnt ion. In this analysis t--mperat-ure changes are also assumed to occur in response to heat Conduction fron impermeable rocks boundin;: permeable fissures. Moreover, in the approach that follows it is aS5uIIEd that the temperature distribution across the fissure is constant and that smooLtily varying temperature changes can be approximated by step chaiigt~s. temperature changes at each node. are used to compute the flux of conductive heat normal to the fissure, at the boundary between fissure and block. A convolution equation for this calculation was derived using an analytical expression for temperature response in n slcf, a\u20ac finite thicliiless, insulated at one end, and subject to an instantaneous change in temperature at the other (Carslaw and Jaeger, 1959, p. 97). l'hc finite-dif ference model of Moench and Atkinson (1978) computes These time-varyjng temperature changes f Calculated heat conduction to or from the fissure is averaged over the width of the fissure and put into the energy equation as a source term for calculation'of the necessary temperature changes. Values of the thermal conductivity and diffusivity used in t:he analysis are given in table 2. saturation is carried out in the manner described by Moench and Atkinson (1978). Computation of the distributionsof pressure, temperature, and Results Figure 2 shows computed dimensionless pressure drawdown (P in the producing well with and without effects of thermal conduction. As shown previously by Moench and Atkinson (1977), pressure drawdown is delayed in time over that expected for a noncondensable gas. depends upon the initial liquid -water saturation and upon the heat capacity of the reservoir rock.

Figure 4 shows that increased producti.on time causes no further shift in the computed pressure bui1.dup. Figurc 5 shows the effect of various block thicknesses upon pressure butldup after a large production time. Thicker blocks are able to supply more heat and hence able to shift: the pressure plateau to a higher level than thinner blocks. Liquid -water saturation in the fissure near the wellbore increases to the value it had prior to production if pressure buildup is allowed to continue indefinitely. Figure 6 shows the effect of thermal conducting layers of diiferent thickness upon the rate OF saturation recovery. rate of recovery in the case of no conduction is shown for comparison. The thicker the impermeable block, the longer it takes for the liquid saturation to recover fully. The The liquid -saturation distribution at different times during production is shown in figure 7 under conditions with and without conduction. At early times the effect of conduction is negligible but with the passage of time the shape of the saturation distribution curve changes as thermal conduction becomes significant. Conduction of heat into the fissure tends to steepen the saturation distribution. Conclusions It has been shown that the conduction of heat into highly permeable fissures from blocks of impermeable rocks might have a significant effect upon the pressure transient behavior of wells in vapor -dominated geothermal reservoirs. The effect upon drawdown is to bring about a slight decrease in the rate of pressure decline, The effect upon pressure recovery is more profound as the heat input brings about a significant shift in the location of the condensation plateau, Conduction of heat also steepens the saturation profile in the flashing zone and decreases the rate of condensation in the vicinity of the wellbore. - P2) = -___. qjJZ.i?T 1 (' i O!q r ll distance) K thermal conductivity impermeable block R thickness (of Impemeable block r well radius S iquid-water saturalio 1 W ?percent of void space) q production rz?te P pressure Pi initial pressure to production time k permeability At time since shut in h fissure thickness zi initial compressibility factor s. i initial liquid-water saturation t time R gas constant T temp era t ure p steam viscosity - molecular weight of water W 0 porosity Table 2.

Haney University of California Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Berkeley, California 94720 The well CGEH-1 (Cos0 Geothermal Exploratory Hole No. 1) was drilled at the China Lake Naval Weapon Center under the supervision of DOE/NVO and CER Corporation by Big 0 Drilling Company. They started drilling on 2 September 1977 and completed the well on 1 December 1977 to 4845 feet. The well is an exploratory hole to determine geological and hydrotheinal characteristics of the Cos0 Hot Springs KGRA. During drilling, numerous geophysical and temperature surveys were performed to evaluate the geological characteristics of CGEH -1. LBL performed eight temperature surveys after completion of the well to estimate equilibrium reservoir temperatures. were obtained by USGS and LBL, and a static pressure profile was obtained. Downhole fluid samples Two flow tests were attempted in 1978. The first test began September 5, 1978 used nitrogen stimulation to initiate flow, but resulted in small flow and subsequent filling of the bottom hole with drill cuttings. The second test, 5n November 2, 1978, utilized a nitrogen- foam-water mixture to clean residual particles from bottom hole and nitrogen was then used to stimulate the well. The well again was dry after stimulation. Water influx was calculated at 4-5 gal/min as the well filled after unloading of the wellbore. Figure 1 shows the location of Cos0 Hot Springs. Figure 2 illustrates the location of CGEH -1 relative to heat flow contours obtained by AWA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) and DOE heat flow holes. performed (1-18) prior to the drilling of CGEH -1. However, the geological characteristics of the Cos0 area are rather complex. is illustrated in the aforementioned references. The area consists essentially of a ring fracture zone located in the basin and range province east of the Sierra Nevada range (19). generalized alteration, geophysical characteristics, and active thermal areas in the Cos0 Hot Springs area.

Figure 4 Final bottom hole vertical depth is approximately 4815 Figure 5 is a synopsis of the completion record. Three large mud losses occurred along the cased portion of the well (CGEH-1 is cased to 3488 feet). An influx of water at a rate of 90 BPH was observed at about 1900 feet. Above this zone, at about 1660 feet, running clay and gravel entered the wellbore. The gravel was subangular and the clay is actually powdered granite with clay -sized particles. Numerous mud losses occurred below 3500 feet. However, it is not known whether this mud went into the fractured zone near 3500 feet or if other fractures intersect the well below this point. THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM PERIOD , December 1977--September 1978 LBL perfcrmed eight temperature surveys (21) before the first flow test. The final recorded maximum temperatuice was 382\u00b0F at 1900 feet. The water level varied, but was found at approximately 890 feet. 6 shows five of eight temperature surveys. zones above 3500 feet (1900, 2700, 3500 feet) where large mud losses occurred during drilling show atypical temperature distribution indicating that the formation was cooled from mud entry. However, zones below 3500 feet where numerous mud losses are observed do not illustrate this abnormal behavior. This seems to indicate that the mud losses below 3500 feet probably entered the large fracture zone above 3500 feet and not into fractures below the portion of the well that was subsequently cased. Figure The figure illustrates that However, there was a large mud loss at T.D. Downhole chemical samples (21) of wellbore fluid were also obtained during this initial equilibrium period. Dis:solved silica concentrations from bottom hole sampels indicate a temperature of 338\u00b0F (201/mb/l). Silica temperatures at 194\u00b0F (40 mb/l). -1 19- The cause of these discrepancies is unknown. However, the drill pipe was stuck at 3488 for a short period. Pipe release and diesel fuel were added to free the drill bit. The presence of residual organics in the wellbore might explain low silica concentrations observed at the 2700 foot depth. (23) FLOW TEST 1 The first extended flow test was carried out September 5 to 8, 1978. During the well stimulation and subsequent flow the wellhead temperature was 262.5\"F (128OC) and the discharge tube temperature was 250\u00b0F (123OC). This occurred during the nitrogen lift at 300 CFM of heated N with the tube at 2060 feet. The nitrogen flow rates were varied as the tube was lowered to the final depth, 4590 feet. When the nitrogen was shut off, the flow decreased to nearly atmospheric pressure at the discharge tube within one-half hour. The wellhead temperature dropped at 95OC at this point. Within five minutes of shutting off the nitrogen, the flow had decreased appreciably. The well was then pressured with 2000 psi pressure at the nitrogren truck for one-half hour. At this time, the tubing was terminated at 4590 feet downhole. The wellhead pressure at this time was 370 psi and nitrogen was pumpted at 200 cfm. an unknown quantity of water, then died. An attempt was made to find a liquid level with the N but the attempt was unsuccessful. The N tubing was then lowered to 4700 feet but no nitrogen returns were observed and the nitrogen pressure reached 3000 psi. tubing was removed, the lower 250 and clay. At this point the flow testing was terminated. 2 The well was open and unloaded 2' 2 When the feet of tubing was plugged with sand FLOW TEST 2 The second flow test utilized a nitrogen -foam -water mixture to clean the bottom portion of the well below 4700 feet. cleanup and stimulation began on November 5,1978 by injecting foam at 1000 feet and slowly lowering the injection tube while continuing to pump foam. Good returns were obtained during the descent. A wellhead sample of the foam was taken for analysis. large amount of grey clay-like material entrained in the foam. analysis by R. Clark (DOE/NVO) indicated that the material was fine The well The sample showed Subsequent -120- powdered granite, not clay. At this point over 100 feet of material was being circulated out of the well, but further progress was not possible due to an obstruction at 4695 feet. An attempt was made to withdraw the tubing, but it could only move a maximum of about 60 feet upward. more than about 60 feet upward. The tubing was wprked up and down a few times and finally came free. However, when it came to the surface there was about 145 feet that had been left in the well. The tubing moved freely downward, but could not be withdrawn During the cleanout procedure, fluid samples were taken from a tube at the wellhead using a high-pressure needle valve for metering. This valve was subsequently plugged with sand grains brought up with the foam. The sand was retained as a sample of the material removed from the well. Before removing the nitrogen injection tube, the well was cleaned to 4695 feet by circulating a water -foam mixture for four hours. After four hours, the well was cleaned by pumping clean water for one hour followed by nitrogen until the well reached its maximum flowing temperature and pressure at the critical discharge tube. The nitrogen was shut in and the well flowed for less than five . minutes, after which the temperature and flow decreased rapidly. The wellhead temperature was 95OC and flow was essentially pure steam. After the nitrogen tube was brought to the surface a different end was made up to try to pass the blockage at 4695 feet. The well was again foamed (this time at 3500 feet) and the tubing was lowered after returns were obtained. The tubing encountered a block at 4490 feet. The well was again cleaned and stimulated with nitrogen. The well again died in less than five minutes after stimulation. The nitrogen was then pumped at 3000 psi with the wellhead shut in for about 15 minutes. The 2\" and 4\" discharge tubes were then opened. No show of water was seen, only nitrogen. No subsequent show of water was found with the well open for 12 hours. A water -level tool was then used to monitor the position of the water level in the well. The water level was first found at 3645 feet. This was about 23 hours after the final pressurization and flow of the well, and 12 hours after shutting in the well. This is an average increase in water level of about 1.3 ft/min 2 4 gal/min. The water level was subsequently monitored closely and it was seen that the time required for the water level to rise 1 foot was decreasing sliqhtly as the height of the water column increased. This continued -1 21 - up to 3460 feet, at which time the rate of filling began to decrease. Since the latter depth is approximately the depth to which the well is cased, we are forced to conclude that the well was not filling from the bottom, but instead the water was coming from the well annulus at the bottom of the casing. Following the well fill-up measurements, the testing was terminated. CONCLUSIONS The well was drilled in very hard rock. It was extremely difficult to prevent drill bit wandering, and the final bottomhole location is Q, 374 feet (horizontal) from the wellhead location with three serious meanders (see Figure 1). During the monitoring of the thermal equilibration, at least 15 downhole surveys were run over a period of about 10 months. Our final surveys, before the workover began, indicated considerable friction below the casing. During the cleanout the nitrogen tubing was broken with a piece apparently lodged between 4490 and 4635 feet. This suggests that the well is currently unuseable at the present time below about 4000 feet due to either cable and wireline cuts in the uncased curved well, fractures which have been opened during the downhole activity, or opening of a fracture during drilling. (The drill bit was stuck temporarily at4771 feet.) 2o the well had about 200 feet of dill, and since the flow seems to come dobm the wellbore, the tension could also have been due to a sticky layer of clay (powdered granite) in the well. It is not likely that there are serious cable grooves below 4500 feet, and the origin of the fill is unknown, hence it is likely that the tubing was stuck in a fracture. Since During drilling there were several circulation losses while using mud. The deepest circulation loss occurred at bottomhole, where more than n, 1400 bbls (n, 59,000 gals) of mud was lost, as shown in Figure 5. This large quantity of mud, plus the material added to the mud to prevent further losses to the fracture, make production from this zone question - able. The apparent lack of significant influx from the lower zone (recall that the maximum influx during well fill-up after cleanout was about 5 gals/min) leads us to conclude that the lower zone is not of significant interest for production of geothermal fluids at this time. seen to be about 40\u00b0F cooler than the zones which are about half as deep. When the temperature log is exam.ined, the bottomhole can be -1 22- The well was cased to about 3500 feet. The largest mud losses during drilling occurred in the zone adjacent to the casing shoe, i.e., in the zone from 3260 to 3500 feet, as shown in Figure 2. In this zone, up to 4000 bbls (168,000 gals) of drilling mud and lost circulation material was lost (note that this follows only if the mud losses while drilling from 3600 to % 4500 feet are all assumed lost in this interval). in the temperature logs taken during thermal equilibration of the well as shown in Figures 5 and 6. It is likely that this zone is contributing the 3-6 gpm of influx that fills the well when the latter is emptied during the flow tests. The mud lost in this zone has a volume equal about 20,000 ft . Assuming an effective porosity of 10 percent we have a damage radius which is at least 17 feet. If this zone contributes all of the flow to the well, the head is 3260-900 = 2360 ft. = 1015 psi. At 385OF this is well above the saturation curve for pure water, and implied that the fluid source is liquid, not steam. The chloride content of the well was the same as that at Cos0 Hot Springs. '* pieziometric head at both Cos0 Hot Springs and CGEH -1 is approximately 3500 feet about sea level. (20) This zone shows up as a broad temperature depression to 3 The While the mud losses are not quite so enormous in the two zones about 3200 feet they are still appreciable. One fracture was encountered at % 2750 feet where more than 2100 bbls (% 88,000 gals) of mud and various materials were lost during drilling. The shallowest and hottest zone was at 2060 feet, where more than 900 bbls (37,800 gals) were lost. It is also noteworthy that at 1900 feet a water influx of at least 60 gpm occurred while drilling under pressure with air. A switch to mud was made at that point, hence there is no indication of how much the formation could flow from that zone. Several water samples have been taken during the course of the well equilibration and during the well tests. probably came from the zone near the bottom of the casing. It is also likely that there has been contamination of the fluid samples by drilling mud and other foreign material. It is unlikely that we have sampled the uncontaminated reservoir fluid. On the other hand, it is These water samples UI -1 23- equally unlikely that the source of fluid near CGEH -1 is at an appreciably higher temperature than observed in this well (< 390OF).

In an attempt to locate these A direct means of determining the locations of the permeable layers is to measure the flow rates at the suspected depths. However, two difficulties immediately arise. Since the flow in HGP-A is a mixture of saturated liquid and vapor, the mass flow rate cannot be measured using a conventional spinner (which is a volumetric flow meter). Furthermore, the temperature encountered in the wellbore exceed the temperature limits of that instrument. To circumvent both of these difficulties, the well was allowed to produce only under severely throttled conditions. This had the effect of keeping the well fluid in a liquid state at temperatures well within the capability of the flow meter. setup used for the production and pumpdown tests is shown in Figure 1. The flow meter The presence of a slotted liner in the bottom 4200 feet of the wellbore does not allow unequivocal interpretation of the data; however, a comparison of the maximum flow rate measured within the slotted liner and that measured at the weir on the surface shows that only a small fraction of the flow passes through the annular region outside the slotted liner. The results for a flow meter run are shown in Figure 2. well was producing at a flow rate of 44 gallons/minute of liquid only (22,000 lb/hr) as compared to 100,000 lb/hr of 65% quality steam at wide open conditions. This indicates that for these slow, all-liquid flow conditions, roughly 75% of the production is occurring between the depths of 4550 to 6250 feet. The The second series of tests consisted of cold water being pumped downhole at 11 5 gal lons/minute while temperature and flow rate were monitored at selected depths.

Gale * University of Auckland 'D.S.I.R. Wellington Summary Although not the first hot-water geothermal field under development, the Broadlands geothermal field has shown itself to be quite different in behaviour to other hot-water fields. years between 1966 and 1971, and has provided a large source of data in its as yet undeveloped state. inferred from well-testing and highlights (1) the complexity of the system, (2) the importance of wellbore storage effects and (3) the effects of reinjection. The field was discharged some five This paper presents some of the results Introduction The Broadlands geothermal field has had long delays in coming into production (for non-technical reasons), which has permitted a quite lengthy investigation of its properties. The field is largely hot-water dominated, however is different from the hot-water dominated Wairakei field in several ways. and demonstrates preferred flow paths and barriers. the system has already reached two-phase conditions at production depth (2000-3500 ft), whereas at Wairakei most of the production depth is still liquid. ance of the steam phase, but the continued presence of dissolved gas i.e. carbon dioxide (Grant 1977). The contribution of the partial pressure of the CO, results in a lower effective pressure of the H,O component with resulting boiling at apparently high (total) pressure. As a consequence of the two-phase conditions the diffusion time of a pressure change is very long (-1 year) compared to Wairakei (- several hours), and the wells tend to act independently of one another to a large extent. pressure transients tend to reflect conditions close to the well rather than properties of the reservoir at large, so it is particularly difficult to interpret well test results. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that several of the wells produce from more than one interval, thus the response depends firstly on the position of the recording instrument. and secondly on whether or not the alternative feed points are producing or accepting fluid - sometimes in fact they do both, and the pressure response shows an oscillatory behaviour. In this paper some of the initial results are summarised, and the effects of the various complicating factors are discussed. Firstly the Broadlands field has a much less homogeneous permeability Secondly the water in A much more significant difference however is not the early appear- As a result single well Initial Analysis During 1977 and 1978, Grant (unpublished reports) has analysed a -1 39- r number of pressure transient tests using more or less standard Horner buildups line source or spherical flow models. these analyses are summarised in table 1. variability in the results due to local variations and also to the various complicating factors mentioned before, there is an interesting trend in the results in that the single well tests show permeability depth products (kh) of order 1-10 darcy-meters while the interference tests show values more of order 100. Firstly the single well tests may be indicative of conditions only in the vicinity of the well (this is highly likely to be so since the pressure response is very slow moving in a two-phase system, and the well tests are of short duration), while the interference tests more clearly indicate reservoir permeabilities further away from the well. A second explanation is that the flow is essentially through fractures rather than through a porous medium (this is most certainly the case) and that each well inter- sects only a single or very few fractures while the pressure response further away is through many intersecting fractures. A third explanation is that the single well tests experience a comparatively low permeability due to relative permeability effects caused by flashing close to the well - this explanation does not hold up in the case of a pump test however. The results of some of Although there is wide There are several possible explanations for this. It is apparent then that single well tests are dominated by effects close to the well, an observation which suggests greater emphasis be placed on well conditions at the time of the tests. have not specifically investigated the effects of well-bore damage and well-bore storage, and it was with this in mind that the results of the well tests were examined a second time. These early analyses Storage and Skin Effects Pressure transients from the Broadlands geothermal field are notoriously problematical in that they frequently show unpredictable fluctuations. that show a more normal behaviour. Taking as an example a buildup test on BR9 shown in table 2, the Horner plot: shows a fairly straightforward straight line - see figure 1 - with a slope of about 6 barslcycle. This slope implies a permeability depth of about 1800 md-ft or 0.6 d-m. How- ever examination of the log-log plot (figure 2) reveals that the flow is dominated by storage effects during almost the entire test period, and thus no confidence can be placed on this permeability estimate. A longer buildup test on the same well illustrated in figure 3 indicates a semilog straight line of slope 9 barlcycle (- 1200 md-ft or 0.4 d-m). After some two weeks of production the pressure recovery declines, suggesting the intersection of some boundary. BR18 shows a similar buildup behaviour (figure 41, with an implied kh of less than 300 md-ft (0.1 d-m), and a levelling off at about 60 days. However amongst the anomalous responses there are many The quantity and quality of data available does not permit quantita- tive statements, however it is clear that storage effects are not the cause of the difference between single well tests and interference tests. This is not to say that storage effects do not exist, and in fact it was an early conclusion of this investigation that essentially all of the -1 40- pressure transient tests performed using Amerada -type gauges are completly masked by wellbore storage. the order of weeks in some wells it is definitely inappropriate to perform permeability tests in this manner. useful permeability estimates. estimates of the order of magnitude of any skin effects due to the lack of a long enough semi-log straight line. for BR18 were in the vicinity of +1, however this figure is not a reliable one.

As another example BRll shows order of magnitude changes in However in consider - The reason for the difference between single well and interference test permeabilities is still not clear, however the following explanation is suggested. If the permeability exists in fractures, then each well will have only limited accessibility to the fracture system, since it may only intersect one or two fractures which may not necessarily be very conductive. However after some time and dist.ance the original fracture will intersect other fractures, some of which may be very much more conductive, thereby providing more permeable paths through the reservoir. Thus the pressure response of a distant well will be \"seen\" through the more permeable system. This explanation fits both the observed single well and interference test -results. ing of the Horner plot after a period of 2 weeks to 2 months, which is indicative of an increase in permeability or alternatively of the inter - section of a constant pressure boundary such as a fault. The single well tests show a flatten - Reinjection There have been a number of reinjection tests at Broadlands, two into the reservoir proper (BR7 and BR33) and one on the outside (BR34). Some interesting results have been obtained, in that no confirmed re- circulation of cold water has been found, despite the demonstrated inter - ference between wells. A rapid return of isotope tracer occurred to the production wells BR8,11, which have good connection to BR33 (see Table 1). ing happened. The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly the injected fluid experiences a negative buoyancy of 0.06 psi/ft due to its higher density, while the driving force between wells (assuming a permeability depth of 200 d-m) would be 0.005 psi/ft (Grant internal report 1977). Note that the removal of cold water by negative buoyancy can only be effective in such highly -permeable rock as this. About 200 t/h was injected into BR33 for 6 months. But no observable cool- Secondly the relative -141- permeability effects would result in a greater permeability to the two- phase production fluid than to the injected water (Grant 1977, Horne and Ramey 1978) - permitting a greater access to new production than to reproduction of the injected water. BR7 is an isolated well, and fluid has been injected into it for two years. Immediately on shutting, hot water begins to flow in the well, as indicated by the pressure rise (Fig.5). Further measurements show a complicated structure of permeability, with some levels discharging hot water during injection, and others accepting the mixture of hot and cold water in the well. BR34 lies outside the production field (temperature 8OoC). It has excellent connection to BRM2. With three weeks' injection at BR34, no thermal effects have been confirmed at BRM2, although chemical changes occurred in less than a day.

MECHANISM OF RESERVOIR TESTING Gunnar Bodvarsson School of Oceanography Oregon State University Corval 1 is , Oregon 97331 (1 ) Introduction In evaluating geothermal resources we are primarily interested in data on the distribution of temperature and fluid conductivity within the reservoir, the total volume of the productive formations, recharge characteristics and chemical quality of the thermal fluids. While geophysical exploration by surface methods may furnish some data on the temperature field and give in- dications as to the reservoir volume, they furnish practically no information on the fluid conductivity and production characteristics. Such information will generally have to be obtained by tests performed within the reservoir, primarily by production tests on sufficiently deep wells. Reservcir testing is therefore one of the most important tasks in a general exploration program. In principle, reservoir testing has much in common with conventional geophysical exploration. A1 though the physical fields applied are to some extent different, we face the same type of selection between controlled and natural drives, forward and inverse problem setting, etc. The basic philosophy (Bodvarsson,, 1966) is quite similar. In the present paper, we will discuss some fundamentals of the -theory of reservoir testing where the fluid conductivity field is the primary target. The emphasis is on local and global aspects of the forward approach to the case of liquid saturated (dominated) Darcy type formaticns. and natural driving pressure or strain fields are to be considered and particular emphasis will be placed on the situation resulting from the effects of a free liquid surface at the top of the reservoir.

Solutions to (2) in the case of a general source density f(t,P), non-causal initial values and general boundary conditions can then be expressed in terms of integrals over the Green's function (Duff and Naylor, 1966). The key to the equation is the causal impluse response This function satisfies the same boundary conditions as the Two fundamental types of expressions for the Green's function are available. First, in the case of simple layered domains B with a boundary c composed of a few plane faces, G(t,P,Q) can be expressed as a sum (or integral) over the fundamental source function p = (8ps )-I( rat -3'2exp ( -rtQ/4at) u+( t (5) and its images. most elementary local and/or global expressions for G(t,P,Q).

In this setting we can combine the potential equation (3) and the surface condition (10) in one single equation confined to the c plane (Bodvarsson, 1978a), which expressed in terms of the fluid surface amplitude u(t,x,y) = p/pg takes the form 1 = f/pgc (11) 1 where is the square root of the two-dimensional Laplacian and f is an appropriately defined source density. To obtain the pressure field in the space z>O, ths boundary values derived from (11) have to be continued into the lower half-space on the basis of standard potential theoretical methods. fractional order of the Laplacian in (11) is quite unusual, but the operator is well defined and poses no mathematical problems. of such operators in a slightly different setting, we refer to a paper by Bodvarsson (1 977b). The For a further discussion Consider the attenuation of a wave formed pressure field of the form exp[-(t/to)+ikx] where to is the relaxation time and k is the wave number. ing into equation (ll), we find that to=l/wk. Comparing this result with the case of the purely diffusive pressure field we find that the ratio of the free surface/diffusion relaxation times is ak2/wk=k@/gps. The assumptions of waves of lengths 10 to lo3 meters and porosities of results in ratios ranging from about lo2 to lo5. are therefore orders of magnitude shorter than for free-. surface Phenomena of a comparable spatial scale. As a result, we can conclude that in most cases of practical relevance, the two phenomena can be separated and treated individually. Insert - to The relaxation times of diffusion phenomena Some solutions of equations (11) of practical interest have been obtained by Bodvarsson (1977a). Confining ourselves again to the simple semi -infinite half-space, the most important result is given by the causal impluse -response function G(t,S,Q,) which represents the response of the surface amplitude at the point S = (x,y) in c and time t>O+ to an instantaneous injection of a unit mass fluid at a point Q in the half-spacF at time t=O+. The system is assumed to be in equilibrium for t<O. - Let Q = (O,O,d), the resulting expression for the sur- face G(t,S,Q) U+(t) is the causal unit-step function. the key to the solution of (11) for more general conditions. in the half-space is obtained from (12) by a simple continuation technique where the singularity at Q has to be taken into consideration. response of the surface amplitude to a periodic source function at Q is of particular interest in the present context. Let the mass flow injected at Q=(O,O,d) take the form exp(-iwt). is then obtained by The impluse response is essentially The pressure field The long term The amplitude of the frequency response The present results on the dynamics of the free surface amplitude provide the basis for a technique of reservoir probing and testing which yields results on c and 0 that are supplementary to the conventional well test techniques (see Bodvarsson and Zais, 1978, this volume).

Short distances tend to yield only local parameter values whereas long distances may lead to results of a more global nature.

A brief account of the free surface results will be presented below. The Laugarnes geothermal area in Iceland The Laugarnes geothermal source area The Laugarnes geothermal area (see Fig. 1) has been described in some detail by Thorsteinsson and Eliasson (1970).

The reservoir is embedded in a flood basalt series of more Fluid conductivity is mainly along the contacts of Evidently, the permea - Several dozen production wells have been drilled in the area during the past decades. The maximum depth is now of the order of 3 km. productivity of individual wells obtained with the help of submerged pumps placed at depths up to 100 meters varies from 1 to 50 kg/s with well-head temperatures mostly in the range of 125\u00b0C to 135\u00b0C. The main production is obtained from an aquifer extending between the depths of 730 and 1250 meters. The pumping load is governed by the demand on the heating system during the course of the annual cycle and varies from about 100 to 300 kg/s. As a consequence of the varying production rate, the elevation of the piezo - metric surface fluctuates in a quasi -periodic way with the year as a basic period. Thorsteinsson and Eliasson (1970) have during the period 1965 to the end of 1969, collected a considerable amount of water level data from 60 observation wells in the area.

No results were obtained Relevant theoretical results presented by Bodvarsson (1977a & b, 1978) permit an analysis and interpretation of the available observational data in terms of estimates of the more global permeability and porosity charac - teristics of the reservoir. Two different procedures are available for carrying out this analysis, namely, 1) the production data can be taken to represent a periodic process with an approximately sinusoidal input/ output, or 2) short sections of the graphs can be analyzed individually as independent processes. On the first approach, input -output amplitude and phase relations for the annual cycle can be estimated with the help of the production rate and water level data in Fig. 3. Unfortunately, the present observational material is deficient in that the peak-to-peak input -output phase lags are small and quite poorly defined. Nevertheless, on the available data, estimates of roughly 1.5 months equivalent to a phase angle of 45 degrees are indicated. Carrying out a numerical evaluation of the complex integral for the frequency response as given by equation (13) in the paper by Bodvarsson (1978 , this volume) for the case of various values of the sinking velocity parameter w, and comparing the results with the observational data, we obtain on the basis of the phase difference a best fit for a value of w = 4~10-~m/s. of roughly 10 millidarcy and porosity estimates of With the help of the amplitude ratio, permeability estimates are obtained. An alternative approach to the periodic input/output data based on a simple lumped system model is discussed in the Appendix. estimates of the permeability and porosity are of the same order of magni - tude as the data given above. The resulting On the individual event analysis of the water level responses to the changes in the production rates, we obtain quite similar results. The theory is based on the following results by Bodvarsson (1977b) for the response of the free water surface to sinks at depth in homogeneous and isotropic Darcy type solids. First, let the initial free surface be at equilibrium and a point -sink of volume rate V be placed at the depth d and start production at t = 0. vertically above the sink is then The initial rate of drawdown of the free surface u = V/21r$d* (1 1 where 4 is the porosity. solid, v the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and therefore c = k/v the fluid conductivity. The long term stat.ionary value of the free surface drawdown vertically above the sink is then found to be Moreover, let k be the permeability of the where g is the acceleration of gravity. -1 54- We apply these results to the production event from September 1968 During the event in question, From the to March 1969 and assume that the point source model can give reasonable estimates of the parameters of interest. the flow rate was increased quite abruptly from 2.5 to 7x105m3/month, that is, by about 0.17 m3/s.

The longer the time scale, the laver the estimate. There appears to be an inverse Although a much more elaborate analysis of the Laugarnes data is indicated, the above discrepancies may be quite real and reflect the very considerable heterogeneity and fracturing of the reservoir. Due to local interconnection by fractures, the short - term interference tests performed on adjacent wells give much higher permeability estimates than the more intergrated global values obtained with the help of the total production rate and well data. The result indicates that considerable caution is called for in the interpretation of relatively short -term well interference tests on complex reservoirs. -1 55- Appendix In processing the periodic data, we can also base our estimates on a lumped model as shown in Fig. 4. The model is characterized by a single input conductance K and a single capacitance S. the capacitance simply represents the effective pore area of the container shown in Fig. 4. Let f be the volume rate produced from the container, h be the average liquid level in the container counted positive down and assuming that the ambient water level is zero, we arrive at the following equation governing the lumped system In the physical sense, S(dh/dt) + Kh := f (4) In the case of periodic flow f = Fexp(iwt) where F is the amplitude and w the angular frequency. and inserting in equation (4) the resulting output -input amplitude ratio is found to be Let the response of the liquid level be h = Hexp(i(Wt-a)), and the phase angle From the graphs in Fig. 3, we find that we can on the average take F = 0.07 m3/s, H = 19m and a = 0.78 radians. system parameters we obtain Solving equations (2) and (3) for the K = 2.7~10-~m~/s = 2.5~10-~Kg/sPa, S = 1.4x104m2 (7) To translate these results into estimates of the average permeability k and average porosity @ we observe that the ground water level depression in Fig. 2 has the shape of a slightly elongated flat disk with an area of approximately A = 4 km2. For the present purpose we replace this disk by a circular one with a radius R = 1.13 km. theoretical relations (Sunde, 1968) , we find that the contact conductance of a flat circular disk of radius R immersed in a porous medium of fluid conductivity c is simply 8cR. on the surface of the half-space the contact conductance is consequently 4cR. value of the actual contact conductance, we obtain the estimate for c as On the basis of simple potential In the present case, where the disk is placed Since the value of K given in (4) above is to be taken as an observed c = K/4R = 2.5~10'~/4~1.13~10~ = 5.5xlO-*s (8 Since C = k/v where k is the permeability and v the kinematic viscosity, and moreover, the porosity + = S/A, we obtain by assuming v = 3~10-~m~/s ( 100\u00b0C) the following estimates k = 1.7~10'~~m~ = 17 millidarcy and 4 = 3.5~10'~ (9) which is of the same order of magnitude as the results given above. -1 56- References Bodvarsson, G., 1977a.

There is a general agreement that observational data on the tidal pressure phenomena may be applied to obtain useful estimates of important reservoir parameters such as the perm- eabi 1 i ty. 1978). A Simple Gasic Model In the simplest setting involving a single open well connected by a small spherical cavity to a large homogeneous and isotropic reservoir, the mechanism of the tidal well test is easily comprehended on the basis of the model illustrated in Fig. 1 below. Let. the permeability of the porous medium be k, the density of the fluid by p, its kinematic viscosity be v and hence the fluid conductivity of the medium be c=k/v. Moreover, let s be the hydraulic capacitivity or storage coefficient of the medium and the diffusivity therefore a=c/ps=k/us where 1-1 -is the absolute viscosity of the fluifl. skin. depth of the medium at an angular frequency w is then d=(a/2~)2 (Bodvarsson, 1970). For the present purpose, concentrating first on cases where boundary effects can be ignored, we assume that the skin depth of the reservoir material at tidal frequencies is smaller than the extent of the reservoir including the depth of the well. In other words, the reservoir can be assumed to be infinite as viewed from the well-cavity. Introducing a spherical coordinate system with the radial coordinate r and with the origin placed at the center of the cavity, the fluid pressure field p(r,t) in the porous medium is governed by the diffusion equation (Bodvarsson, 1970). The where t is time, b(t) the tidal dilatition of :he medium and c is the formatioq matrix coefficient.

In the case of a closed well equation (4) will have to be expressed in terms of the well-head pressure rather than a water level.

Since in most practical cases, the effective dilatation Eb and formation capacitivity s are of less interest than the formation fluid conductivity c, the latter quantity is generally the primary target of any interpretation of observational tidal well data. Equatiorx (4), (8) and (6) show that c has to be derived from the tidal factor T and that this factor can be separated if we are able to observe the water level amplitude at two different tidal frequenctes. Since the tidal force field includes a number of frequencies this will generally be possible. able to obtain T and thus on the basis of (8) the admittance A, the fluid conductivity will have to be derived with the help of (6). In the rather idealistic situation with a spherical well-cavity of known radius ro, we are therefore, in principle, able to reach our goal of obtaining a numerical estimate of c. Being, in principle, From the practical point of view, the procedure will, however, break down if T >> 1. and the water level amplitude h will be independent of the fluid conductivity. In practice, we can expect this difficulty to become serious when about T >3.Since in most cases the factor 4ng/fw will be of the order of lo7 (MKS), we see that the above inequality implies roc>3x10'7(MKS). at 100\u00b0C with v = 3.10-7m2/s we obtain then in terms of permeability rok > 3~1O-~x3xlO-~% 0.1 darcy-meters. Therefore, taking, for example, ro = 0.5 m, we find that the above dffficulty becomes serious for permeabilities in excessof 200 millidarcy. well situations is sensitive only to small to medium permeabilities. Due to increasedstiffness S, the applicability in the case of closed wells is more restricted. The factor T/(l+T) is then approximately equal to unity For water In other words, the tidal test based on open Deviations from the basic model Non-spherical we1 1-reservoir connection. The assumption of a spherical cavity is perhaps to most obvious idealization in the above basic model. Unfortunately, the symmetry of the pressure field will be broken in the case of a non-spherical cavity, and the above simple relations may,in principle, not apply. However, provided the dimensions of a non-spherical cavity are much smaller than the skin depth d of the medium,and this will mostly be the case, the difficulties arising are not too important from the more global point of view. The global pressure field at some proper distance from the cavity will be approximately spherically symmetric and the above analysis will largely be valid. tance is not given by the simple relation (6) and other analog relations have to be relied on. establishing the form of the cavity.

Figure 1 shows They found that to have a good match Atkinson et al. also presented an analysis for a pressure inter- face test run in the Travale-Radicondoli area. Travale 22 well was flowing and the pressure recorded at wells R1, R3, R5, R6, R9, and Chl (see Fig. 3). Analysis of these data showed that piessure interference in this reservoir can be matched by considering pure linear flow (Figs. 4 and 5). This indic:ated the possible presence of a vertical fracture intersecting the Travale 22 well. It was deter - mined that fracture is oriented along the N73\"W direction. In addi- tion, the pressure interference data showed that no boundary exists within 2 kilometers from the fracture plane. It was mentioned thzt linear flow should take place in both horizontal and vertical direc - tions. In this case, the Analysis of Drawdown Data -- -~ As mentioned previously, both wellhead pressure and flow rate were measured when this well was continuously flowing during almost two years. First the bottomhole pressure was calculated and plotted on a semilog paper (Fig. 6). Data on this graph show a curve of in- creasjng slope similar to a fractmed vel1 case. The pressure seems to stiibili.zc at 400 days, indicating a possible constant pressure houI:dsry. A log-log graph of the pressure data is shown in Fig. 7.

The data appears to match the curve for Results from this analysis and from previous work are summarized It can be seen that although both the results from in Table I. buildup and drawdown analysis suggest the same type of geometry for the system, they do not agree regarding the dimensions of the reser- voir. Further effort is needed in the analysis of additional draw- down data not presented in this work. from the buildup data are more reliable because the analysis was based on several tests. At this point, the results Conclusions A preliminary analysis of the drawdown data for the Travale 22 well seems to indicate the following: 1) the well is intersected by a highly conductive fracture, as found from the buildup and interference data, and 2) a constant pressure boundary seems to exist, causing the system to reach pseudosteady flow at about 400 days.

COMI5ION MELCIIOR OCMlPO No. MEXICO 5, D.F. ABSTMCT. Transient pressure analysis methods were applied to analyze the results of injec - tion tests carried out in a recently com- pleted geothermal well in Los Azufres Geothermal field in Mexico. Potential use of those methods (employing injection, two rate injection and fall off tests) is ilustrated in obtaining important well and reservoir parameters at the well completion stage and in predicting future well perfor mance. Also, based on the experience obtained with this well and other similar wells, suggestions are made on the type of analysis which is most applicable. INTP,ODUCTIC)N. Injection tests are carried out as a part of completion procedures of geothermal uslls in the Los Azufres Geotherinal Field, Michoacan,blexico. The main purpase of these tests is to obtain early information about the well and reservoir parametprs in order to predict future well performance. Injec - tion tests are considered especially use- ful to achieve this objective, as the prob - lems associated with two phase flcw condi - tions observed during draw -down and build - up tests are avoided, making the eventual analysis simpler. Moreover, injection tests are easier to carry out than the drawdown and build -up tests. In this paper the application of different pressure analysis methods to the results of several injection tests carried out in a geathermal well ia Los Azufres is illus - trated; and the potential of these methods in reaching the above objective, even with inconlplete data, is demonstrated, GENERAL BACKGROUND. Los Azufres Geothermal Field is located in the State of 'ljchnacan in Central Mexico. It is on the E-W oriented neo-voicanic axis and is covered by neo-quaternar volcanic deposits overlying a basement 02 lutites and sands. Nicrogranular andesites fOrm the lower part of the volcanii formatioils and are overlaid at places by riolites and pyroclastics. Alteration zones and thermal manifestations are clearly related to tectonic activity and are located near faults and fracture 4638 3' piso. zones. The wells so far drilled in this area are sited near the known major faults in order to encounter secondary permeabil - icy associated with them. The main production is thought to come through fractures. The completion of the well is shown in Fig. 1 which also includes the data on circula - tion fluid losses and perczntage core re- covery. It was drilled almost completeley in frac - tured andesitas. The fractures filed with silica, chlorite and epidote. 'The portion of the well below 2200 m was highly fractured and fragmented as was observed from the last two cores taken and as confirmed by very poor core recoveries. 'The well was drilled using bentonitic mud from surface up to 1501) m arid with water from 1500 m downwards. The circulation was totally lost at 2224 m \u20acor one hour, then partially recovered ad was lost again completeley at about 2332 in. The last part of the well was drilled with total loss of circulation. The first series of tests were carried out when the well was at 2404 m, after a core had been taken at this level. Here when the first attempt was made to core, it was found that there was an accumulation OF cuttings 50 m thick at the bottom, and after several trials these cuttings were cleaned with a batch of mud. The second series of tests were run after deepening the well to 2450 m and putting a liner as shown in Fig. 1. The well was stopped at this depth for reasons of well safety, problems with water supply and materials. -- TEST PROCERIJRE.

(3). ?he results of the analysis with this method are also presented in tahles I1 and 111. Although two or three different matches could be made for earch test, an average of the parameters obtained with different matches give a reasonable indication of the order of values sought. One can also observe that the average values obtained by this method compare reasonably well with the average values obtained by the log-log method. With Semi-Log Method. In order the confirm the conclusions obtained by the log-log analysis semi - log standard plots of data were also made. It was found that wellbore storage effects were dominating almost all or a very large portion of the data; and either the semi - log strairht line data were lost com- pletely (because of not having sufficient clock time) or only the beginning of the required data were recorded. Therefore, it was impossible to analyse the data by this method. However, the semi -log plot of the results of the first test (the longest recorded test) are presented in Fig. 13 as an example. It can be seen that towards the end of the data semi -log straight line conditions are being reached, and the slope of the drawn lines may give an idea about the lower limit of the transmissivity value. One can also observe a high skin effect, Other methods of analysis were also tried. In Figure 14 one can see the results of the conventional two rate analysis (2) of the second test. It will be noted that the roper straight line portion of the data K ad not been reached. The method suggested by Gladfelter et aL (4) for the data dominated by wellbore storage effects, was also applied to the results of some of the tests. Although it was possible to obtain reason ahly good semi -log straight lines in every case, the transmissivity obtained was very low (in the order of 1.60 d.m./cp) compa - red to the values shown is tables I1 and 111. However, in plotting the graphs, a figure of 0.0351 mJ/m (0.0672 bbl/ft) was used (as calculated using the actual hole, casing and pipe djniensions dclring the tests) for casing czpncity. This figure gives a C value of 0.1551 bbl/psi. On the other hand the tests results indicate a C value of about G.250 bbl/psi. When a correction WRS made UJL\"& CIIlJ IULCLI \"'LLUL, it 1.:2,5 found that smaller than those obtained by type curve matching methods. Also it has been observed with the method that unless one uses very small tinle intervals (one or two minutes) one gets a large dispersion of points. It was also found that with this type of wells one can not use methods of analysis employing logarithmic pressure change versus time. This is probably because the late time.transients are short and the early time transient data are nasked by welllbore storage effects. Thefefore, it is very difficult to select the plot which gives the right straight line for the evaluation of the parameters sought. In the case of the five tests considered. usually there were not any late time transient data, and when they were recor - ded either they were not sufficient or they could not be used for analysis for the above reasons. D1SC:USSION. Although the results obtained by the type curve matching methods vary from match to match and from one method to other, they are all of the same order and give a good indication in what range the actual values lie. In fact the average values obtained by both type curves agree very well and give a very good idea about the parameters soup,ht. It seems the log-log method pives results with less dispersion and for the data used appears to be superior to the other as it also enables us to calculate the sto- ritivity.( P hct). It will be noted that the second series of tests indicate a transmissivity 10% higher than the value obtained by the first se- ries of tests. This is quite logical as the additional drilling of 40 m after the first series of tests, through an obvi - ously fractured formation, must have increased the transmissivity by increasing the h. The skin damage appears to he high, but understandable when it is remembered that almost 220 m were drilled with no return of the circulation fluid and the cuttings were obviously pushed into the fractures, causing a skin damage. It clearly lies between 5 and 10. The storage coefficient indicated by both series oE tests is about 0.250 bbl/psi which is about twice as high as the value calculated taking ir?to account the profile of the well (0.1578 bbl/psi). The discrep- ency may he due to the fractured nature of the tested formation, with the frnc- tures acting as a part of the well storage. This may be slipported by the increase in well hy30 m. It will be noted that the storitivity is nearly doubled after this c+nri+iiri+v -~ft~r the dppppnjng nf the I .-- --- -.-.*.. -.-I + zones along the well depth. The results of these tests are plotted in Figure 2. It can be noted that although the formations below 2200 m were generally permeable, several well defined zones had higher permeability and might be associated with fractures and/or fractured zones. The best permeable feature appears to be the zone where the first total loss of circulation was observed (at aboilt 2224 m). Also a pressure -depth survey was made to determine the standing water level in the well. It was found to be at about 672 m. The tests were carried out using a Kuster pressure gauge to monitor the pressure changes. Three -hour clocks were used as clocks of larger capacities were not available. The first series of testing consisted of three tests as follows: I.- With the pressure gauge at 1472 my injection at the rate of 500 litres/ rnin., for 370 minutes, then recovery for 236 minutes. 11.- With the pressure gauge at 1472 m, injection at a rate of 1000 litres! min for 75 minutes and then raising the injection rate to I500 litres/min and injection at this rate for 45 minutes. At the end of this period water was injected at a rate of 2050 litres/min and there was a partial return of water after about 4 minutes. 1Ii.-With the pressure gauge at 1500 my injection at the rate of 800 litres/ min for 136 minutes. The second series of tests were carried out as follows: I.- With the pressure gauge at 2000 m, injection at 800 litres/min for 258 minutes, and then recovery for 140 minutes. 11.-With the pressure gauge at the same level, injection st 1OOn litres/min. (Data monitored for 124 minutes). During this test, the injection could not be kept constant. The results of these tests are platted in Figures 3 through 7. ANALYSIS OF THE RESI!I.TS. With Log-Log Method. Although, almost always the tendency is to analyze the results hy means of the semi- Log method, it has been found with similar tests that in almost all cases the well - bore storage effects dominate and mask a large part of the data, and it is diffi - cult to define the proper semi -log straight line. Therefore;. the results wexe first plotted in a log-log form, and analysed by means of the\"Type Curve Matching\" techni - que using the type curves of Ramey et a1 (l),enlarged versions of the curves presec ted as Fig. C.6 in monogram Vo1.5 of the SPE (2). The matching procedure for four tests tusing the log-log plots is illustrated in Figures 8 through 12. The well ard'reser- voir parameters were calculated using the formulae for dimensionless pressurepdimen- sionless time and dimensionless storage coefficient,as shown in apendix A. The results of the analysis are presented in tables I1 and 111. The results of the last test were not analyzed for the reason that the injection rate during this test was not constant. With thexesults of some tests one could obtain more than one good match, In these cases the best match was selected by comparing thevalue of the storage coeffi - cient obtained by the formula 3 in Apendix A with the value obtsinec! by IJS~P~ tbt! - data on the unit slope parts of the log- log graphs and the formula 4 in Apendix A. In some cases, however, it was difficult to select the best match amongst two matches and the parameters obtained by both matches were presented in tables I1 and 111. In the case of the analysis of the recove - ry part of the first test the differences between the C values indicated that :he beginning of the recovery has. perhaps 3.7 minutes later than assumed. The data were adjusted taking this time difference into account and a new match was obtained. The results of the new match are not signi - ficantly different from the previous match. The results calculated by this method indicated that with the data used, semi - log straight line should start about 3 hours after the beginning of the test, It was clear that in some tests the useful part of the data for semi -log analysis was lost during the period when the Kuster gauge was raised and relowered, after re-winding or changing the clock; and in others only the beginning of the semi - log data was recorded within the \u20acirst 3 hours of clock tine. It is well known that the \"Type Ciarve Matching Techniques\"- are especially use- ful when the wellbore storage effects last a long time and early time transient data exist, as it was the case with the tests carried out. However under these circumstances the methods give only aproxirnate values. Therefore, the results were analyzed by means of ano ther\"Type Curve Matching\" technique, using the type curves of Earlougher and Kersch (3). (Larger scale versions oi rile curves p~e~eriiad dis Fig. C.7 in Monograph Vol. 5 of the SFE (3). -1 78- additional drilling, indicating that the additional 40 m were highly fractured forming a psuedo -porous medium. The storitivity value obtained from the first series of tests is quite acceptable, because if one assumes 0 = 0.1 and ct = 5.7 x 10-5 (Kg/crnZ)-l one gets h = 298 m which is very close to the permeable intell- Val observed (2410 - 2200 = 210 m). The tests during which late data were registered do not show the typical fractu - red reservoir behaviour, indicating that the formations are behaving like porous. However, typical semi -log curves of frac - tured formations were observed with the data of another well in the same field. Finally, if the flow efficiency is calu- lated using the results of first and fourth test, a value between 0.51 and 0.52 is obtained. When one takes into account that when the well was eventually induced, it produced 63 t/h, it indicates that if the skin damage can be removed the well will produce about 123 t/h. CONCLUSIONS. I.- Injection tests can be successfully used to determine well and reservoir parameters at the completion stage of a well and the results can be analysed with the established meth - 11.- They are easy to perform and Kuster . ods. pressure zauges are sufficient to record the pressure changes. However clocks of at least 6 hours period are required to register all the necessary data. 111. - Injection data are usually dominated by well bore storage effects and the parts which can be analysed by semi - log methods are short. For this reason it is absolutely necessary to make log-log plots to define the data which can be analyzed by the semi - log methods. 1V.- In cases where a large part of the semi -log straight line data is missing, or too short to be identi - fied, the type curve matching techni- ques using the type curves of Ramey et a1 and Earlougher and Kersch can be successfully used to analyse the early time transient data. Although the results obtained are approximate when several tests are carried out reasonably reliable average values can be determined. The log-log analysis with the type curves of Ramey et a1 are iikely to give more consistent results.

In this paper a brief overview Earth Tide Effects The gravitational attraction between the sun, moon, and rth induces a radial deformation of the earth which results in the readily observable oceanic tides. The same mechanism also generates a state of stress on the surface of the earth which has been re- ferred to as earth tides. Due to the low compressibility of the earth colcpared to that of water, the pressure transients caused by earth tides are of mall amplitude. However, the pressure changes are of sufficient magnitude to cause water level variations in open wells and pits, and several investigators have indicated that a relationship exists between the amplitude of the response of an open well system and the characteristics of the formation and the fluid contained therein.

Specifically, assuming negligible wellbore heat loss, steam and water discharges at the wellbase were back calculated from the surface values. The wellbore heat loss was less than 1% in the wells tested because they have been flowing for a long period of time. Total discharge values were divided by the wellhead pressure in order to filter out changes in discharge due only to pressure depletion in the reservoir. Thus, changes in discharge due to relative permeability effects were isolated. determine fluid densities, viscosities, and enthalpies.

Constant Pressure Production Conventional well test analysis has been developed primarily for constant rate production. Since there are a number of common reservoir production conditions which result in constant pressure production, there is a need for a more thorough treatment of trans- ient rate analysis and pressure buildup after constant pressure pro- duction. In this work by C. Ehlig-Economides, the following assumptions are needed: flow is strictly radial, is homogeneous and isotropic, with constant thickness h, porosity 4, and permeability k. The fluid viscosity is constant, and the total compressibility of the fluid and the porous medium is small in mag- nitude and constant. The equations to be solved are the following: and the porous.medium lim pI)(rD,tD) = 0 ; (t,, > 0) for unbounded reservoir (21) r- D a p 1: r (R,t )= 0 ; (t > 0) for closed bo~nded reservoirs, R = -- (22) D W D u ar, p (R,t ) = 0 ; (tD > 0) for constant pressure bounded reservoir (23) 1) 1) where: - kt - 2 $lJcrw tD 1: = r/rw, D 5 is wellbore skin factor. Transient rate solutions have been tabulated in the literature. In this work, the numerical Laplace inverter by Stehfest6 is used to generate solutions for the transient wellbore rate, the radial pres- sure distribution, and cumulative production including boundary and skin effects. Pressure buildup after constant pressure production has not been properly handled in the literature. following equation exactly represents pressure buildup after con- stant production under the conditions mentioned at the beginning of this section. It can be shown that the J tDf tDf where p is the dimensionless shut-in pressure at the wellbore, is the p!?owing time before shut-in, At D is dimensionless rate, defined above, and p is the shut -in, dimensionless wellbore pressure drop for constant rate production, defined by: is the elapsed time after qn Dw This work is nearing completion.

Macias Stanford Geothermal Program Stanford Un iver s i ty Stanford, CA 94305 Radon transient analysis is being developed as a method complementary to pressure transient analysis for evaluation of geothermal reservoirs. The method is based on the observations of Stoker and Kruger (1975) that radon concentration in produced geothermal fluids is related to geothermal reservoir type, pro- duction flow rates, and time. radon concentrations were markedly different in vapor-dominated and liquid-dominated systems, and varied not only among wells of different flow rate in an individual reservoir, but also varied timewise in individual wells. The potential uses of radon as an internal tracer for geothermal reservoir engineering were reviewed by Kruger, Stoker, and Umafia (1977). Also incluaed were results of the first transient test performed with rapid flow rate change in a vapor-dominated field. The results of the next four radon- flow rate transient experiments were summarized by Kruger (1978) , in which effects of well interference and startup production in a new well were demonstrated. Four of these first five radon transient experiments have been carried out in vapor-dominated reservoirs at The Geysers in California and Serrazzano in Italy. of the transients of radon concentration following abrupt changes in flow rate is being evaluated by Warren and Kruger (1978). The fifth test was at the HGP-A well in Hawaii, the first transient test in a liquid-dominated reservoir. Stoker and Kruger showed that The systematics Three additional radon transient tests have been carried out, each in a different type of geothermal resource. was in a petrothermal resource, the reservoir created by hydraulic fracturing by LASL in the hot, dry rock experiinent in New Mexico. The results of this first 75-day production test of continuous forced circulation, during January-April, 1978, are given by Tester, et a1 (1978). The results of the radon concentration measurements made during this test are summarized by Kruger, Cederberg, and Semprini (1978). The second test was a second transient test at the HGP-A well in the liquid-dominated reservoir at Pohoiki, Hawaii, and the third test was a second transient test at the Grottitana well in the Serrazzano field at Larderello, Italy. The general observations of these tests are listed in Table 1. A summary of each of these three tests follows. The first test During the LASL hot dry rock flow test, five samples of re- circulating production fluid were obtained by wellhead sampling. Two samples were obtained during the following shutin and ventiag periods of the test, and one sample of makeup wacer was analgzs2 durinq the test.

Radon data from the LASL Phase I test Two of these, (1) the possibility of continuous radium dissolution and (2) the increase 'of radon solubility with decreasing reservoir temperature, have been discarded. The two remaining mechanisms, (3) an increase in emanating power of radon by recoil or diffusion from the rock to the recirculating fluid, or (4) an increase in the area of fractured rock surface (at constant emanating power) through increased fracturing of the formation by the recirculating fluid pressure and temperature differential cannot be distinguished. Current investigations by Macias (private communication) to determine the dependence on radon emanation on the pressure, temperature, and pore fluid density in fractured rock should assist in examining these two mechanisms. 1 12- / a = 1075 b = 0.C80 day\" !$ -.

Logistics curve for Phase I radsn daca -203- The second test at the HGP-A well in Hawaii was run in July, 1978 in a manner similar to the first test of July, 1977 described by Kruger (1978). Both tests, with flow duration limited by en- vironmental constraints, were run with changes in orifice plates to provide maximum flow through an 8\" hole and minimum flow through a 1-3/4 - 2\" hole. Flow rates were measured by the Russell James lip-flow pressure method (1962). The radon concentration and flow rate data are shown in Figure 3. Both short -period tests show essentially a constant radon concentration, independent of flow rate, in accordance with the horizontal flow model proposed by Stoker and Kruger (1975). However, the short flow qeriods preclude observation of any longer period transient. Several interesting trends are noted in the mean value data given in Table 2, primarily the increase in radon concentration per unit flow rate resulting from both an increase in mean radon concen - tration and a decrease in flow rate between the two tests. This observation may be consistent with the growth in radon concentration noted by Warren and Kruger (1978) for a newly producing well in a non-producing section of The Geysers geothermal field. If the model of \"boil out\" of condensed fluid near the wellbore is valid, observation of increased radon concentration per unit flow rate with further production in the HGP-A well can be predicted.

Radon data from HGP-A well in Hawaii, 1973 -204- The second test at the Grottitana well at Serrazzano, Italy was run in August 1978 in cooperation with the ENEL staff in Castelnuovo. The preliminary results of this test, shown in Figure 4, agree well with the results of the November 1976 test, again showing a strong dependence of radon concentration on flow rate. However, Table 3 shows an interesting difference in this dependence related to the range of flow rates obtained. In the initial test, the flow rate was decreased from the full normal of about 11.8 t/hr to a value of about 7.5 t/hr. The observed transient was rapid (less than 1 day) and the radon concentration per unit flow rate was constant at a value of 7.3320.76 over the entire flow rate range. In the current test, the flow rate was reduced in two stages, from 11.3 t/hr to 8.1 t/hr and then to about 5 t/hr. The two samples obtained for the first reduced flow rate showed a [Rn]/Q value in agreement with the previous value for the same flow rate change, but differed markedly for the lowest flow rate. Three possible physical reasons could account for this non-linear dependence on the lowest flow rate: (1) the increased reservoir pressures associated with the lowest flow rate sufficient to result in increased emanation from the reservoir rock (as indicated in the LASL hot dry rock experiment); (2) the possibility of a non-linear contribution from radon emanated from the boiling front to the well, as suggested for steam systems by Warren and Kruger (1978); and (3) the possibility of partial condensation of the steam under subcooled conditions during transit to the well. of Macias on emanation under known reservoir conditions will be of value in distinguishing between these possibilities.

Karmarkar University of Hawaii Honolulu, Hawaii 96822 Introduction One of the most economical and simple methods of determination of two-phase flow parameters in geothermal well testing is the so-called James' method [1,2]. The method consists of the measurements of lip pressure (p), and the flow rate of water (w) by a conventional weir. The stagnation enthalpy (h ) is then determined from a plot showing versus which is &npirically determined by James [1,2]. The mass flow rate is then determined from the following empirical formula ho 0.96 G = 11,400 - (1) P 2 hFo2 where G is the total mass flow rate in lb,/sec-ft , p is the lip pressure in psia, and ho is the specific enthalpy in BTU/lbm. The above relation is empirically determined for discharge pressure up to 64 psia and pipe diamters up to 8\". For pipe diamters smaller than 0.2\", it has been suggested that the value of 11,400 be replaced by 12,800. important to assess its accuracy and range of applicability. In view of the widespread use of the James' method, it is Two-Phase Critical Flow Theory In this paper we shall compare the wellbore discharge character - istics obtained from James' empirical formulae to those predicted by Fauske's two-phase critical flow theory [3]. Fauske suggested that in two-phase flow the maximum discharge rate may not necessarily be accomplished by a shock front. condition the absolute value of the pressure gradient at a given location is maximum but finite for a given flow rate or quality, i.e., He proposed that at the critical flow (dp/dz)G,x = maximum and finite, (2) where z is the coordinate along the streamwise direction, and x the quality of the saturated mixture. Under the assumptions of (i) annular flow pattern, (ii) two-phases -207- in thermal equilibrium, (iii) negligible frictional loss, and (iv) one- dimensional steady flow, Fauske [3] obtained the following analytical expression \u20acor the critical flow rate of a saturated mixture: = [gcr/g/ - u2 Gcritical where Q (1-x+kx) x (dv-/dp) + (v-(1+2kx-2x) +v 1 lbm-f t /v ) /2 with gf lb -sec the specific volume of the saturated vapor and Thus, the critical flow rate can be calculated quality and the lip pressure are known. v and vf denoting g (3) liquid respectively. from Eq.(3) if the steam The corresponding stagnation enthalpy can be determined from where R is the gas void fraction which is related to steam quality [41. In compagison with experimental data, Levy [4] found, however, that using Eq.(4) for the computation of ho would lead to under-prediction of the mass flow rate. For this reason we shall compute the stagnation enthalpy on the basis of a homogeneous model, i.e., 22 ho = hf(l-x) + h x + G vh/2gCJ , g where v = v (1-x) + v x and J = 778 ft-lbm/BTU . hf g The weir flow rate is then determined from w G(l - X) . Results and Discussion For a given set of values of lip pressure and steam quality and with the data of saturated steam-water properties [5], Eq.(3) can be used forthe computation of total mass flow rate G . The stagnation (5) -208- enthalpy and the weir flow rate are then determined from Eqs.(5) and (6). The results of the computations for the lip pressure from 14.7 psia to 200 psia for geothermal well testing applications are plotted in Figs. 1 and 2. When the lip pressure and the weir flow rate are measured in a geothermal well test, the stagnation enthalpy of the reservoir, the steam quality at the well head, and the total mass flow rate can easily be determined from these plots. To assess the accuracy of the James' method, calculations were carried out for five different sets of lip pressure and weir flow rate using James' empirical formulae and Fauske's theoretical prediction (i.e., Figs. 1 and 2). The results for total mass flow rate, the stagnation enthalpy, and the steam quality are tabulated in Table 1 for comparison. It is shown that the results based on the two methods differ within 8%.

Geochemistry and Petrology are currently accepted as two evaluation yard- sticks in geothermal well evaluations. Investigations of cuttings and cores during drilling operations, along with studies on formation waters could be used in a predictive nature for temperature and productivity and could yield useful information on the resource. Well logs and wireline surveys are means Drill Stern Tests (DST'S) or Pit Tests Logging in Geothermal Wells Logs in general are extremely useful devices in single or multiwell reservoir evaluations. Formation Pensity, Neutron, Induction, Sonic, SPY Gamma -Ray, Caliper and Oipmeter logs are widely accepted by the geothermal industry. Depending on the types of formations penetrated by the well, some togs are preferred or rather have a higher priority than others. volcanic rocks density and sonic logs could be preferred to dipmeter and to neutron 1 ogs . For example, in The above formation logs could also be used in estimation of static formation temperatures at various depths. reading thermometers attached to these logs in individual logging runs, are used in a buildup analysis to estimate final temperatures. The temperatures , obtained from maximum A current problem with the use of some logs is their temperature limitations, This 1 imitation sometimes proves troublesome and costly in geothermal well evaluations. of logs to be run, c) their schedule, could result in significant time savings and cost reduction. However, careful plans relating to a) type of logs, b) the number -21 3- A critical review of available literature and field evaluations revealed the current temperature 1 imitations for some of the existing logs: Type of Log Resistivity Standard: Dual Induction (DIL) Single Borehole Compensated Sonic (BHC) Hot Hole BHC, No Sp, No GR Long Spaced Sonic No SP, with GR Temperature Pating (OF) 350 500 350 500 400 350 Density Formation Density Compensated (FDC) 400 Compensated Neutron Log (CML) 400 Di pmeter Four Arm High Resolution 350 For example, in evaluating a +5OO0F well, at a depth of 6,000 to 10,000 feet, it becomes difficult, even wiTh a cooling run, to obtain a DIL, or a Long Spaced Sonic or a Dipmeter for the entire well depth. Given the above limitations, in hot water geothermal wells with static temperatures around 50C\u00b0F, it is recommended that SP be run with the Hot Hole Single Induction Log. Gamma Ray-Caliper could be run in combination on one trip, preferably after a second cooling run. If nipmeter Log is desired it should be scheduled immed - iately after a cooling run. The Hot Hole BHC Sonic could be run alone.

If total lost circulation occurs and if one is To increase the chances of obtaining all desired logs, and to save considerable time by el iminating the prerequisite temperature surveys a1 ong wi th mu1 ti pl e cooling runs, logging industry is pursuing research and development on tools for high temperature environments. electronics for geothermal well logging applications are also continuing, A Drill Stem Test (DST) vs. a Pit Test A DS or a Pit test is usually conducted as a first step in the productivity evaluation of a geothermal well. The objective is to gather flowing bottom hole and wellhead data. Analysis of successful tests can yield information on a productivity index for the well, and a permeability -thickness product, preferably from a pressure buildup. rigged up, a pit test is run in a cased hole, after the rig release and install - ation of ax-mas tree. are beyond the scope of this discussion. DOE sponsored programs in advanced high temperature Usually a DST is run in an open hole while The costs of these tests, though relatively comparable, If a DST is elected in evaluation of -214- the well, the results of this test could be used in a decision to run a liner, to abandon the well without running a liner, or possibly to continue drilling. There is a greater chance of getting (good) bottom hole data through a DST. In a pit test one relies on either a) wireline pressure and temperature bombs at mid-perf's, or b) bottom hole pressure (only) estimation through nitrogen tubing pressure which is surface recorded .) and the nitrogen volume data. A disadvantage in both DST and Pit tests with bottom hole recordings is that the data is not available until the tests are over. ments are not uncommon when tools or charts are brought to surface.

Often these tests only serve in a partial cleanup of lost circulation, or they merely enable production of few wellbore volumes before running out of storage capacity. produced formation brine and mud proves costly and time consuming. production rates and slightly longer test times , however, are possible through a pit test.

Rudisill Thermal Power Company 601 California St. San Francisco, California 94108 Brady's Hot Springs is a hydrothermal area located approximately 28Km northeast of Fernley, Nevada. manifestations of geothermal activity occur along a north - northeast trend fault zone (herein referred to as the Brady Thermal Fault) at the eastern margin of Hot Springs Flat, a small basin. Since September, 1959, Magma Power Company, its subsidiaries, and Union Oil Company (as Earth Energy Company) have drilled numerous wells in the area. In 1977 Magma's 160 acre lease in Section 12 was assigned to Geothermal Food Pro- cessors (GFP) for the purpose of providing heat from the wells on this acreage for the dehydration of food. GFP made appli- cation to the Geothermal Loan Guarantee Program (GLGP) assistance in financing the effort, and consequently the GLGP office turned to the USGS for a resource evaluation. in turn recommended that a pumped flow test was necessary to truly determine the ability of the acreage's wells to provide the requisite water flow rate, temperature, and composition for the plant's operating lifetime of at least 15 years. Conse- quently, Thermal Power Company was contacted and procured to design, arrange, conduct, and evaluate a pumped flow program to satisfy these questions. Surface for The USGS Brady's Geology Brady's is easily accessed from Reno, Nevada by driving 88Km eastward on U.S. Interstate 80, taking the Night - ingale-Hot Springs exit, and heading eastward toward the Hot Springs Mountains, on whose northwest flank lies the area. Small steam vents, areas of warm ground, and spring sinter deposits are present for 4Km (2.5m) along the zone of the N 19OE trending Brady Thermal Fault. some 9.6Km (6m) through the area. It is a normal fault of small displacement ( 100') dipping 70 -80 NW with the down- thrown side to the west. range type faults in the western U,S.* been occurring for a minimum of 10,000 years as evidenced by the sinter deposits sandwiched between Pleistocene Lake The fault itself extends The fault is typical of the basin and Fluid emergence has Lahontan sidements. 3 Foyr main rock types are exposed in the Brady Hot Springs area : 1. Volcanic rocks of Tertiary/Quaternary age, chiefly basalt in the mountains east of the springs ; -218- 2. Sedimentary rocks of Tertiary age consisting of sandstone, shale, tuff, diatomite, and minor limestone; 3. Lake deposits, of late Pleistocene Lake Lahontan; 4. Coarse alluvial fan and pediment deposi'ts. \"Regional gravity and magnetic surveys do not sug- gest the presence of an upper crustal heat source. 'I2 cooling magma or other intrusive body does not appear to be supplying heat to the Brady system. The geology suggests that the system is the result of deep circylating water, typical of basin and range hydrothermal systems. Thus, a Production Test A pumped flow test was designed to evaluate whether this complex reservoir could support GFP's dehydration plant with 700 gpm of 270'F (132\u00b0C) water for the plant's 15 year life. A shaft-driven turbine pump capable of pumping 600 gpm of water was purchased by GFP and installed in the designated producer, well Brady 8. The pump's bowls were set at 500 ft. to provide sufficient net positive suction head to prevent the entering water from flashing before entering the pump. The nearby artesian well Earth Energy 1 (EE-1) was instrumented with a Sperry-Sun Pressure Transmission System (PTS) with a % of 1% accurate Bourdon tube gauge to measure interference effects. Three more distant wells (see Figure 11, Bradys 1, 3, and 4, were monitored for interference effects by measuring their changing water levels, with a Powers Portable Well Sounder. Some baseline data was gathered and the pump, driven by a portable diesel engine, was activated. A back pressure was maintained at the surface on the pump sufficient to both regulate the flow rate at 650 gpm and to allow the measure- ment of the water in a single liquid phase by means of an orifice. The test began shakily as a lack of constant supply of bearing flush water prevented continuous operation. Finally this logistical problem was overcome and a test of 7300 hours of virtually continuous, 650 gpm pumping was accom - plished. Unfortunately, drawdown levels in the producer, Brady 8, couldn't be measured because the proper instrumenta - tion was not installed with the pump. However, build-up after shut-in of the producer was measured and plotted semi- logarithmicly in Figure 2. The response of wells Brady 1 and 4 was accurately measured auring both drawdown and building and are presented in Figures 3 and 4. EE-s displayed no measurable response. - - The conclusion of the test wells were 1) that Brady 8, although cased to 1048', appeared to be drawing production from a zone from 610 ft. to 800 ft. which is open to the shal- low wells Brady l (1567 ft.) and Brady 4 (723 ft.). (See Figure 5). (2) EE-1 appeared to be isolated from this region by casiEg to 894'. (3) From the drawdown curves of Brady 4 and Brady 1, it appeared that the shallow reservoir being drawn upon is being fed by a deep, vast reservoir (probably -21 9- deep circulating up the Brady Thermal Fault) which would cause the pressure decline of the field to slow greatly over time. The build-up behavior of the wells confirmed the recharging ability of the system as wells B1, 4, and 8 logarithmicly approached their original water level. . Finally, (4), water composition and temperature remained constant throughout the test, indicating a reliable, continuous reservoir composition. Thus, it was concluded that the Brady reservoir has a reasonable chance of providing the required flow rate for the 15 year plant life. Injection Test A short term injection test was then designed to answer the following questions: 1. Determine the injectivity of EE-1, the most pros- pective injection candidate due to its apparent isolation from Brady 8's production zone. during injection. 2. Determine the zones in the well which accept water 3. Determine as quantitatively as possible the rela- tive ability of each of these zones to accept water. ability of EE-1 for GFP on a production basis. 4. Use the data gained above to ascertain the suit- To accomplish these objectives in an expeditious manner it was decided to store fresh water on site, inject water in the well at initially varying rates, log the well while injecting at a constant rate, and then re-test the injection of injectivity of the well to determine whether any changes of the well's injectivity had occurred over time. Neighboring well's water levels were to be measured throughout the testing of EE -1. Performance of the Injection Test The performance of the injection test consisted of the following actions: (a) Static temerature surveys. (b) Wellhead selection and installation. (c) Pre-injection surveys. (d) Injectivity tests. (e) Injection surveys, (f) Survey at varied flow rates. (9) Interference effects. EE-1's Suitability as an Injector From the field work, it was apparent that EE-1 in its present condition did not accept the design injection rate of 700 gpm without pressure interference at B-8, the producer. Water injected down EE-1 leaves the wellbore through 3 exit points': -220- , 1. the 9 5/8 in. - 7 in. lap at 371 ft. 2. the perforations at 1880 ft. - 1940 ft. 3. the perforations at 3200 ft. - 3300 ft. It appears that the upper regions are causing interference with B-8. Accordingly, the injecting of water in zones above 2000 ft. must be avoided if EE-1 is to be used as an injector. Referring to the schematic of EE-1 in Figure 6, this could be accomplished by running smaller pipe into che 44-in. liner below 2000 ft. and cementing back to surface. The tremendous pumping penalty imposed prevents this course of action from being a viable option. Alternatively,:one could consider pulling the 44-in. liner, reaming out a larger hole below the 7-in., and running a somewhat larger casing through the 7-in. down to the preferred depth. This operation poses a high drilling risk as well as a rather severe pumping penalty, and was thus also deemed a less-than-preferable action. Two other alternatives appeared available to GFP. A temporary surface disposal system could be cleared with the applicable Nevada State agencies. This system could be employed until GFP determined the ultimate course of action to take - whether to drill a new injection well, or ' attempt to rework EE-1 in the latter manner detailed above. It was recommended to GFP to pursue all alternatives with the ultimate objective of disposing the water underground. The GFP plant has operated using surface disposal one month as of December 3, 1978 without problems from the geothermal reservoir. Unfortunately, preoccupation with operational problems concerning the food dehydration equip - ment has precluded the gathering of even rudimentary reser - voir data. Hopefully, as the everyday plant operations smooth out more attention can be turned towards the reservoir. References 1.

After flashing the steam to atmospheric condi - tions, nearly seven billion pounds of produced reservoir flnid have been reinjected into the Eiulalo reservoir. In spite of the large quantity of reservoir effluent that has been produced and reinjected, insufficient testing has been conducted to determine the total commercial power generating capacity of this large liquid -dominated reservoir. The preliminary estimate of generating capacity has led to the current installation of 220 MW. Field development for the installation of four 55 MW units is in progress. initial 55 NV unit is scheduled for operation in July, 1979, with Unit 2 to operate in the fourth quarter of 1979. Con- tinued drilling and production testing up to the initiation of comnlercial operation will afford periodic reserve updating and confirmation for additional power - generating units. After commercial power generation commences, data will be available t.o establish a more reliable estimate of the Bulalo iield potential. The As a result: of the increasing worldwide energy crisis, the economic harnessing of alternate energy sources has become more attractxive.

During the past four years, twenty -eight wells have been drilled and completed in the Bulalo heat anomaly. These wells have defined a large, liquid -dominated geothermal reservoir characterized by a high-temperature effluent which can be produced to generate commercial power. PGI has developed an active drilling and exploration program which has investigated approximately 7.3 square kilometers (i800 acres) of the Bulalo field prospect. Continual expan - sion of this exploration acreage is augmented by the drilling and completion of an additional well nearly every month. A comprehensive well testing program has been developed to understand and define the geothermal reservoir characteristics. However, the ultimate productive capacity and extent of the Bulalo anomaly will only be determined by future drilling and long-term production. This report describes what is currently known about the Bulalo field within the Makiling -Banahao area. GEOLOGY -- The Makiling -Banahao contract area, as shown in Figure 1, is located in the Laguna province southeast of Manila, below the Laguna de Bay. The area is characterized by surface hot springs most prevalent near the town of Los Bafios at the northern base of the Makiling volcano. Spas and thermal baths are popalar in this area. Other hot springs and geother - mal surface manifestations are widely spread between the Maki- ling and Banahao volcanoes in an area of several hundred square kilometers. The Bulalo field is located to the south of the Makiling volcano. The prospect is currently the southernmost geo- thermal anomaly that is being actively developed by PGI within the Makiling -Banahao contract area. The Bulalo field is located approximately sixty kilometers southeast of Manila as shown in Figure 1. The area lies between the Banahao and Makiling volcanoes and is, in general, characterized by tuffs, lahars and lava flows of the basiiltic-andesite type. and are overlain in areas by the Banahao volvanics leading to difficulty in accurately defining the stratigraphy. The drilling arid production testing programs have defined thr; subsurface Rulalo structure as a large heat anomaly principally composed of a fractured andesite formation in the north and central portions, and a fractured tuff to the southeast. The fracture system within the reservoir is believed to be controlled by major faulting, oriented according to the main north -south regional trend, with transverse faulting trending in the eas Makiling volcanics are older -229- SUYMARY OF DRILLING OPERATIONS Twenty -eight wells have been completed in the Bulalo field by PGI since January, 1975. These c:ompletions comprise the total Bulalo field exposure to date., The wells have been drilled on a 0.26 square kilometer (65 acre) pattern, in general, with approximately 7.3 square kilometers (1800 acres) of total reservoir exposed to date. The degree of infill drilling over the economic project life will be dependent upon a more accurate assessment of the reservoir.

Both formations are believed to have similar fluid -in-place characteristics and the reserve potential is comparable for both types of formation. The south - Productivity Characteristics The production testing program has defined the stable total mass flow rates at a commercial operating pressure of 140 psia. Production at this pressure is a mixture of steam and water, the relative proportions depending primarily upon the reservoir fluid enthalpy. Com- mercial total mass flow rates for the Bulalo field vary from 130,000 lbs/hr to 833,000 lbs/hr. Commercial steam rates for indipidual completions range from 50,000 lbs/hr to over 275,000 lbs/hr. Individual steam rates have been found to vary moderately within a controlled range of economic pressure conditions. The first 110 MW plant, composed of Units 1 & 2, will require 2.1 million lbs/hr of steam. Nineteen producers have been allocated to supply the required steam for Units 1 & 2 operation. I Ixectivity Characteristics. The produced water from all the flow testing has been reinjected into the reservoir. No measurable injectivity loss or static reservoir pressure alteration has been detected. Although the temperature of the reinjection fluid to date has been 135OF, commercial operation will involve the disposal of produced fluid at 325\u00b0F. The reinjection of fluid at the elevated temperature will have the benefit of reducing any long-term damage phenomena; and less fluid heat-up will be required prior to any subsequent production of the reinjected fluid, if such occurs. The steam production requirements for Units 1 & 2 will lead to a reinjected demand of 6.0 million lbs/hr of produced fluid. Five injection wells are currently planned to dis- pose of the 3.0 million lbs/hr of produced fluids associated with Unit 1. Additional injection capacity will be required for commercial operation of subsequent units. LoIg-Term Production Test. A long-term production test irivoiving the production of four wells and reinjection -- -.-.---- into one well has just been completed. for over six months demonstrated the very stable flowing conditions of the Bulalo completions.

Pressure response data following the majority flow tests have been monitored and the analyses of the results have indicated a definite trend. The central completions, which are generally the shallower wells, behave as a radial flow system with high flow capacity. Along with the extensive production The deeper flank completions are generally dominated by vertical fracture behavior with less flow capacity. These results have led to the current feeling that the central reservoir portion is composed of a fractured matrix with well-defined horizontal and vertical fracture exposure. The deeper flank completions are believed to expose pri- marily a vertically fracture-dominat.ed system. Pressure buildup analysis has indicated that these flank completions expose vertical fractures ranging from 25 to 175 feet in fracture half-length. Chemical analyses of the produced fluids have defined a reservoir bri.ne characterized by 2330 ppm chlorides, 16 ppm ppm silica with pII of 6.6. -232- 1 I + 4- + 0 a V 4 TAYABAS BAY I - S C AL E I : I, 0 03,O 0 0 -233- SYSTEM APPROACH TO GEOTHERMAL FIELD DEVELOPMENT Seiichi Rirakawa The University,of Tokyo Department of Mineral Development Engineering Faculty of Engineering 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113, Japan INTRODUCTION Geothermal energy will play an important role. Thanks to the great endeavors of those engzged in the geothermal field development in Japan, it has becone possible to generate 50M?/hr of electricity per unit field. Up to this day, as is often the case with its stage in the cradle, the main purpose has been to produce electricity from geothermal steam. The target of exploitation has mainly been the area by surface geological survey and the reservoirs are located not deeper tharn 1500 meters. The technology for geothermal resource development necessitate full application of every essential technique in order to cope with the various types of objective geothermal resources, and, since it has direct influence on the profitability of investment, it needs to be evaluated from an overall vipwpoin-t. The evaluation, at the scme time, must be carried out efficient:Ly, invoking various effective methods. Therefore, it is expected to develop a simulation model which gives rational data for a judgement in working out strategies, such as the scale of the exploration, installation of utilities and schedules of investment and development. With a view to it, the model should be able to simulate both physical and economical phenomina through the life of the geothermal field, that is, from the beginning of exploration to development and utilization. It also should at once deterriine the optimum conditions the static and dynamic characteristics of' the reservoir, the depth and the number of production and injection xells, the fittest layout and specifications of thc: site including surface fpcilities,, the behavior of pressine, enthalpy 2nd other behaviors of the geothermal fluids flowing from the bottou to the hezd of the well and the costs associated with explo t 3 t ion, product ion and operat ion. Thc p~li*posc: of this study is to develop simulation models for optimizing the scheme from exploration to utilization and to compose siridat i r3n pr.ogi-anis for a digital computer. -234- C OhTCEPT S Generally system approach seems to be advantageous when applied to a large scale project such as the geothermal field development. The process of the study on geothermal resource development system starts with planning, selection, analysis and composition of the system. Design of a system, reliability analysis and evolvement of the composition accompany the process, employing various techniques of simulation, optimization and computation, Thus the development pattern for economical operation is drawn - how should geothermal energy be extracted from a specific reservoir and utilized at the lowest cost or with the best recovery rate with economy assumed to be of second importance? Hitherto the main concern of geotherma:L resource development in Japan has Each essential been geothermal steam production for generation of electricity. technology for exploration, drilling, development, production, transportation and generation of electricity is open to the charges of being rather separate and desultory. Utilization of geothermal energy other than for electricity generation has been mostly for recreation and therapy in baths and spas at low temperature levels, but recently there has been a trend toward multipurpose usage of hot water. And the target of exploitation is not necessarily the area of shallow zones; every type of geothermal reservoir is now explored. It is important to categorize the results of research work on each elemental technique, to make up a formula for geothermal exploitation and development and for effective utilization of various types of promising resources macroscopically, to develop the knowhow for establishing the most appropriate conditions for exploitation and development, to rearrange different priorities for future development, and to point out hardware items which should be investigated and tried out. A model for exploration of large scale deep geothermal resources should be able to simulate the layout, depth, number of production and injection wells, well head pressure, and steam composition and enthalpy of hot fluids, to esti- mate drilling and operating costs, discharge of hot fluid and the option and layout of surface facilities and to print out the optimum condition of the system. for geothermal resource development. This is of great significance in determining the most efficient system The ou.tlines of each subsys.tem xhich is the component of the to tal. syatorn for geotheix$. field develcpment are explained below. (I) Subsystem fi3r exp3.orati.on investigation Preliminary surface and subsu:rface surveys are the first, step taken. Surface sur-vey is classified roughly into two categories, one of geolo~i.r.:al struct;l;.rc and the other of anomalies caused by the existarice of gcothermlzl fluid. The former consists of geologic surveys and gr'a,-vil;y, n!i-ignetic and seismic prospectir,g. The latter includes -235- surveys of hydrothermally altered rock, electrical conductivity surveys, geochemical surveys, geothermal gradient surveys, heat-flow determinztions and microearthquake measurements. Meanwhile subsurface survey comprizes structural boring, drilling of exploratory and reinjection testing wells, geological and geochemical logging, core analysis and other types of logging. The.objective of these exploration surveys is to locate geothermal reservoirs. As there are many types of geothermal resources, it is necessary to establish the exploration system which suits one of each type. In a broad way, geothermal heat itself and/or geologic structure are the keys to the exploration. A structuiral boring is done into the geothermal reservoir recognized by compiling every result of the surveys and all the cores are preserved for the analysis of reservoir characteristics. After the rough surveys, detailed surveys follow drilling at least three exploratory wells (six wells in a practical manner in Japan.) The reservoir size, reserves, fracture distributions and production ability are evaluated to provide data for the next development subsystem. (2) Development -and production subsystem A reservoir model is composed as a function of outer valuables such as the reservoir delimitations assumed by the above submodel, the location, number and depth of exploratory wells, information obtained from them, and geological, topographical and environmental factors. Then the optimum project scheme is set up and carried out. In the development stage, the data from drilling of the production wells and various well tests performed at the same time are put together for the necessary calibration of the model. It proceeds to the production stage next production and transportation subsystem. In the production stage in accordance with the various accumulated data, the optimum condition of the project is 'obtained by defining the uncertain factors involved with the heat source and the discharge mechanics. Therefore the production system from the reservoir to the well head is independently designed to be made optimum at each time step. The principles of the model of the development and production system are as follows. and providing data for the 1) Objective process clt?veI.opnient starts, the subsystem deals with software which covers -to thF: start of cperation, field wor.!cs such as drilling of wells ani1 the progress to the ~rell hod oi^ a production well in the operat ion ::t;Lg:e.

Alfred H. Truesdell, U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, Calif. Regular chemical sampling and analysis of fluids produced from the hot-water geothermal system of Cerro Prieto, Mexico has provided early warning of reservoir processes (Manon et al., 1977). The changes in chloride concentration, sodium to potassium ratio and measured fluid enthalpy are shown in the figures for wells M-5, M-26, M-21A, and M-11 of the Cerro Prieto field. The concentration of chloride, a conservative\" constituent, is characteristic of different water masses and is affected by a change of water source, by mixing of waters and by boiling and steam loss but not by reaction with rock minerals. geothermal index resulting from rock-water reaction and is not affected by boiling and steam loss or by mixing of water masses provided these processes occur at constant temperature. The enthalpy is related to the fluid temperature and to boiling in the aquifer with \"excess\" steam entering the well. These indices provide a reasonably complete picture of major reservoir processes occurring in hot water systems. should be used in addition to Na/K as a temperature indicator. Analysis of fluids from a producing geothermal field must of course include other constituents for study of environmental effects, scaling, corrosion, etc. I1 The ratio of sodium to potassium is a temperature -sensitive Silica analyses have not been reliable from Cerro Prieto but Well M-5 at Cerro Prieto shows uncomplicated behavior in which a single liquid phase with little \"excess\" aquifer steam was tapped and production has shown little change over the life of the well (fig. 1). Before April 1973, initial production was through a small diameter pipe and was cooled conductively so little evaporative concentration of chloride from steam loss occurred and the chloride concentrations of produced fluids approximated that in the aquifer. After April 1973, water was collected from the production separator and flashed to atmospheric pressure during sampling. Steam separation in the separator and during sampling resulted in a 35% loss of water as steam and a 1.6~ concentration of chloride in the remaining liquid. From 1973 to the present the chloride concentrations after flashing have decreased slightly as the fluid temperature and the amount of steam separated have decreased. The decrease in temperature is indicated by the increase in the Na/K ratios and the decrease in enthalpy. The temperature drop indicated by Na/K was from about 313 +3OC to 302 tZ\u00b0C (the variation depending on the geothermometer scale used) and that indicated by enthalpy was from 312 to 281OC. The larger drop and lower absolute temperature indicated by enthalpy may result from initial excess aquifer steam or from inaccuracies in this rather difficult measurement. The downhole -239- temperature of 299OC measured in 1977 (F. J. Bermejo, unpublished data, 1977) agrees more nearly with the Na/K temperatures and aquifer chloride concentrations based on Na/K temperatures are more constant (at 8,960 t20 mg/kg by one scale) than are those based on enthalpy which show an apparent increase from 8,700 to 9,700 mg/kg. The other wells show less regular behavior. The chloride concentration after flashing of water from M-26 declined suddenly in mid-1975 indicating drawdown of lower chloride fluids into this part of the production aquifer. Temperatures calculated from Na/K ratios and enthalpies also declined but showed 110 discontinuity in 1975. This suggests that the fluid temperature was maintained by heat transfer from rock minerals. Fluids from well-21A had initial enthalpies of 420 to 480 cal/gm equivalent to a temperature of 360 to 37OoC if the aquifer fluid were entirely liquid water. The initial chloride concentrations were also unusually high. By 1977 both the enthalpy and the chloride had declined rapidly to values similar to those of M-5 fluids. The Na/K ratio was initially only slightly lower than that of most well fluids but showed a normal increase with time and the Na/K indicated temperature was 315 +5OC throughout the period shown. The probable explanation for the unusual behavior of M-21A is that initial fluids contained large amounts of excess steam from boiling in the aquifer and these were replaced with more normal fluids as production continued. The high chloride concentrations resulted from boiling in the aquifer with heat re-supplied to the fluids from rock minerals. Well M-11 suffered a casing break in 1975 and higher level fluids with lower enthalpy and chloride and much higher Na/K ratio entered the well. When the break was repaired and an upper production interval near 900 m cased off, the well performance was greatly improved, with production of high C1, high enthalpy, low Na/K fluids similar to early production fluids. Regular collection and analysis of water (and gas) samples from a hot-water geothermal well is an essential part of a well-testing or monitoring program. The chemical data obtained complements physical measurements and may give the earliest warning of breakthrough of natural or reinjected cold waters. Analyses should be as complete as possible but constituents indicating reservoir processes (Cl, Na, K, Ca, Si021 and mineral deposition (pH, HC03, C02) should be analyzed with special care.

Thus, a nec- essary prerequisite for a full-scale test of the LASL Hot Dry Rock Concept, that of establishing a high flow rate between wells at low wellhead differ - ential pressures, was satisfied. Previously, communication with EE-1 had been through and between high-impedance fractures, and flow was insufficient to evaluate the heat-extraction concept. In September a preliminary test of the entire system -surface plant and During 96 h of closed -loop circulation, downhole flow paths was conducted. fluid total dissolved solids remained low (~400 ppm), water losses continually decreased, and no induced seismic activity occurred. The operating power level was 3.2 MW (thermal) and fluid temperature reached 130\u00b0C at the surface. This test demonstrated for the first time that heat could be extracted at a usefully high rate from hot dry rock at depth and transported to the surface by a man- made system. Full-scale operation of the loop occurred for 75 days from January 27 to April 12, 1978. designed to examine the thermal drawdown, flow characteristics, water losses, and fluid geochemistry of the system in detail. Results of these studies are the major topic of this paper which is divided into three separate parts cover - ing first the heat extraction performance, second the flow characteristics and geochemistry and third the use of acoustic techniques to describe the geometry of the fracture system. In the third section, dual-well acoustic measurements used to detect fractures are described. These measure - ments were made using modified Dresser Atlas logging tools.

Peak power was Thermal Drawdown Analysis. terms of effective heat transfer area it was assumed that the fracture system could be described as a single circular fracture. This is indeed an approxi - mation -- the actual fracture need not be circular, and furthermore the temperature surveys and other evidence accumulated to date suggests that instead of a single fracture, heat was extracted from one main hydraulic fracture which was connected to the producing well by a multitude of natural joints of limited heat transfer area. plicated geometry however, initial attention was restricted to a model of a single circular fracture in order to provide an approximate estimate of the effective heat transfer area. This model has been described in reference 1 and employs numerical techniques to solve the two-dimensional fluid motion and energy equations as well as the one-dimensional, but transient, rock energy equation. Property variations with temperature, fracture aperture changes due to thermal contraction, and natural convection effects are in- cluded. Because the hydraulic fracture itself is much more permeable than the surrounding rock, it was assumed that fluid was confined to the fracture and that heat was transported from the rock to the fluid in the fracture solely by means of thermal conduction in the rock. The possible enhancement of heat transfer area because of thermal stress cracking was not considered in the model. ing rock, particularly at very early times as indicated by the formation water losses shown inFig. 1-4. To correct for this effect the fluid loss was assumed to occur uniformly over the fracture area so that on the average, heat was removed from the reservoir by all of the produced water flow and half the difference between the injected and produced water flows. In the calculations, the observed time variations of production and injection flow rates as well as the reservoir injection temperature were Despite the 5 MW(t).

The downhole temperature variation due to heating of the injected fluid within the well was calculated with a one-dimensional convection and radial con- duction code. To start with,a constant value of 0.1 mm was taken for the fracture aperture. This value resulted in an initial overall flow impedance of 15 bars per liter per second, in accordance with the early observations. The radius of the modeled fracture was then varied until the predicted thermal drawdown matched the measurements. The results for a 60-meter (200 ft) radius fracture agreed quite well with the measurements, as previously shown inFig. 1-2. Because of hydrodynamic flow inefficiencies only about 75% of the circular area actively transferred heat, so the effective heat transfer area was only 8000 m (one side of the fracture). accessible to water. The effective heat transfer area is strongly influenced by the vertical separation of the fracture water inlet and outlet locations. Unless buoyant forces significantly affect flow (corresponding to fracture impedances lower than those measured) the water only partially fans out from the inlet and then flows fairly directly to the outlet, and thus the effective heat transfer area swept by this flow is a direct function of the inlet,and outlet spacing. In the present case the spacing between the inlet, located at 2.76 km (9050 ft) in the injection we11,and the production well connection with the highest flow capacity is approximately 100 meters. Roughly speak - ing, then, the effective area would be that of a circle 50 m in radius, namely 2 We emphasize that this is not a measure of the total fracture area 7900 mz, very close to that derived with the simulation model. The possibilities of reducing flow impedances and enhancing heat transfer area by means of thermal cracking as the reservoir cools and contracts have been discussed by M~rphy.~ Subject to the large uncertainties in our know- ledge of the maximum horizontal earth stress, it was estimated that the effects of thermal cooling might be apparent after a cooling of about 75\u00b0C or more. at 48 days there is a period of eight days in which the temperature was constant. Additional constant temperature intervals are noted starting at day 58, and then again on day 68.

The results of the four experi - ments are described by plotting normalized tracer concentration as a function of effective fracture system or throughput volume as shown in Fig. 11-2.

Several general comments can be made: (1) the fracture flow system has grown considerably in size during the 75-day ter;t,the integrated mean fracture system volume was 14,900 gal on 4/7/78, up from 9090 on 2/9/78 and the median volume is larger, 12,800 gal versus 6750 gal, (2) there is evidence for the development of additional secondary flow paths, that is the tendency toward earlier and later arrival of dye with smaller and larger residence times (or volumes) causing an increase in the spread of the distribution, (3) the apparent degree of mixing or dispersion is virtually unchanged between the 3/1/78 and 4/7/78 experiments as shown by the similar shapes of the phase 1-2, 1-3, and 1-4 curves when plotted on normalized volume coordinates.

Relatively fresh makeup water (~400 ppm TDS) is injected into the reservoir where it mixes with and dilutes the fluid contained in the fracture system. when the makeup water rate is high, the dilution effect dominates and con - centrations are low. As recirculation continues and the water loss rate to permeation decreases, the concentration of dissolved material rises and eventually approaches an asymptote. The sharp peak on day 23 corresponds Initially, -250- -8- to a sudden change in flow impedance, a short shutdown and a resulting partial flow back of fluid (see Fig. 11-1). Water which had been forced into the rock pores returned to the circulating system because of a transitory pressure decline, providing a source of high concentration fluid. As the system returned to its initial injection pressure, the fluid which returned from the poreswas replaced and high makeup flows were required. 15 days in the Si02 concentration vs time graph (Fig. 11-3). value of Si02 concentration shown in Fig. 11-3 suggests a reservoir tempera - ture of 188\u00b0C.2 The temperature of the water leaving the fracture system and entering the wellbore was measured downhole. circulation this downhole temperature was below 160\u00b0C corresponding to a quartz -controlled saturation concentration of less than 147 ppm. declining mean reservoir temperature could not account for the increasing Si02 content in the fluid. A secondary flow path at the initial reservoir temperature is required. According to a simple kinetic model, the chanae in silica concentration with time for that fraction of the flow corresponds to a first order rate depending on the difference between the silica satura - tion value of the highest reservoir temperature in contact with flowing fluid and the average silica concentration at any particular time: The dilution effect of this high makeup rate is seen for 10 to Assuming quartz -control led saturation of Si02 in solution , the asymptotic Within three days of Clearly the (11-1 ) where ka*is a constant which includes relevant mass transfer rates, dis- solution kinetics rates, and a rock surface area to fluid volume parameter. Assuming no dissolution or reprecipitation occurs in the cooler main flow path, a differential material balance shows that the rate of accumulation of Si02 is due to three principle effects: flow path, the fluid loss rate due to permeation, and the production of Si02 due to active dissolution and/or displacement in the hot region.

J. N. Albright - Introduction The success in establishing flow between wells at Fenton Hill is due in part to the development of crude acoustic measurement techniques which enabled targeting of a hydraulically fractured rock volume for the final directional drilling of the production well.

In order of decreasing flow, the fractures are located at 2.64 km (8665 ft) (35%, 2.69 km (8815 ft) (12%). km (8541 ft). the flow moves behind casing from2.92 km to 2.76 km (9053 ft) where it enters the reservoir through a hydraulic fracture. 64 m (210 ft) before the lowest entry point in GT-2B is reached. other fractures over the depth interval 2.1-2.9 km (7000 to 9600 ft) accept water on pressurization of the injection well, but these account for only a small percentage of the injection into the reservoir. Because of the depth of the reservoir, the major fractures are believed to be always vertical or nearly so.

One system is that used by Dresser Atlas in providing their Acoustilog log - ging service. the principal difference being the use of a more powerful transmitter.

On pressuriz - ing the system the S-type cap region transforms to a P-type and the mixed types of the lower part convert to D-type. One can reasonably assume that prior to hydraulic stimulation, the reservoir consisted of entirely S-type regions, the red lithology in Fig. 111-4. their spatial distribution in the reservoir, and the changes in waveform effected by pressurization are of global significance in understanding the reservoir. Changes in signal type occur even above the contact, a region quite removed from the injection and production fractures.

Shearing stresses were not transmitted hence fractures are present in the S-type region. The fractures must however have sufficient contact area in the unpressurized state so that loss of shear waves by scattering or back reflection does not occur. In the unpressurized system an S-type region Clearly the waveform types, There can be little disagreement that the S-type rock supports Further, in the absence of fractures, shear phases will not vanish Our observations indicate to the contrary that within Because P-type regions do not transmit shear waves, it may imply that these regions contain mega -fractures which have single or mu1 tiple single parted surface areas exceeding several acoustic signal wavelengths in one dimension. pressurized above the least confining stress should be P-type. One anticipates that only regions containing mega -fractures Somewhat -259- unexpected is that this condition is met locally in the reservoir without pressurization. Indeed one is led to the conclusion that the fractures do exist which have mismatched parted surfaces caused by relative displace - ments or chemical dissolution resulting in a self-propped condition. between S and P is an apparent contradiction. Components of shearing stress (shear waves) normal to parted fracture surfaces should propagate through the fracture even though that component parallel to the fracture surfaces is reflected. but in fact is not. A solution to this dilemma has not been found.

Such modification requires new sets of constitutive equations and the applic2tion of realistic thermomechanical material properties. In The present DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The method described here has been developed to provide a means to understand in a broader sense, the behavior of a system consisting of a porous deformable rock mass saturated with a single phase liquid which is under the combined influence of fluid pressure, boundary flux, and boundary loads. plate model for flow in fractures have been used to define flow in the porous rock mass. The theory of elasticity together with a non-linear Darcy's law for flow through porous rock and the parallel fracture model is used to define deformations in the parous skeleton as well as in the fracture network. In order to provide an interrelation between fluid flow and structural deformations in the rock mass, two constitutive relations introduced by Biot (1941) have been used. In addition, an interconnection between flow in fractures and in the adjacent porous rocks was developed by writing mass balance relations. A finite element numerical procedure was adopted in this analysis because obtaining analytical solutions for stress and flow problems in porous rock masses with complicated geometries and boundary conditions is a difficclt, if not impossible, task. Through proper use of calculus of variations, the governing equations and boundary conditions are cast -265- into discrete finite element equations--the solution of which gives fluid pressure and structural displacements at all nodal points specified within. the region uider investigation. The application of finite element procedures in this study has been quite advantageous. region and has offered freedom to describe the geometry in two dimensions. The use of two-dimensional isoparametric eleinents for defining the porous medium and onr-dimensional isoparametric elements which define fracture It has provided flexibility in discretization of the segments has further contributed to the efficiency of the numerical procedure. Furthermore, the numerical method developed in this study enables one to obtain stresses and flows within each element very efficiently. The present numerical development has also proved to be capable of handling a wide range of problems from steady -state flow under static equilibrium conditions to transient flow under quasi-static equilibrium conditions. The rock may be porous and permeable or impervious. The rock mass can be deformable or structurally rigid. may be located in the porous medium and its boundaries, in a fracture segment or at the intersection of fractures. The pressure or flux source In addition, isolated or nonintersecting sets of fractures can be incorporated into the region under study. Yn the analysis of rigid fractured syst.ems simulated by the present method, it has been shown that the flow into the well is proportional to the total length of the fractures intersecting the well. This has been shown for either one or two fractuxes that intersect the well. -266- The study of the response of a defoimable fractured porous medium sihject to fluid withdrawal from a well intersected by the fractures has revealed that the fractures close more rapidly at early time, while at later time drop in the porous medium. fractures in impermeable systems where the deformations will continue with further changes in fluid pressure. the rate of closing reduces due to the subsequent pressure Such behavior is not expected to occur in The nonlinear behavior of joints in fractured systems during fluid flow with changing strcss can be studied more quantitatively using the present mctliod. variation of fracture stiffness due to fluid pressure. cannot be expected to reduce the stiffness of fractures in a porous medium when highly compressive initial stresses exist.

Bafanta Summary One important question in the hot dry rock geothermal energy scheme is the spacing and opening widths of secondary cracks that are induced by cooling in the walls of the main crack and propagate into the hot rock mass. periods of operation, it would be necessary to have widely opened secondary cracks, which in turn requires a large spacing of these cracks. To achieve a significant heat extraction rate after longer The problem may be treated as a cooled halfspace. When a system of equidistant cooling crack propagates into a halfspace, it reaches at a certain depth a critical state at which the growth of every other crack is arrested. Later these cracks reach a second critical state at which they close. The intermediate cracks, at doubled spacing, open about twice as wide and advance further as cooling penetrates deeper. Determination of the critical states requires calculation of the derivatives of the stress intensity factors with regard to crack lengths, which is accomplished by the finite element method. It is found that the crack depth -to-spacing ratio at which the critical state is reached is extremely sensitive to the temperature pro- file. It greatly increases as the cooling front becomes steeper, which is not favorable for maintaining a high heat extraction rate. of transverse isotropy of the material upon the location of critical states is found to be relatively small. Approximate formulas for crack spacing as a function of temperature profile, to be used in conjunction with the analysis of water flow and heat transfer in the cracks, are developed.

C.R. R.J. Greenfield U.S. Geological Survey Reston, Virginia 22092 Introduction Changes in porosity and permeability due to water- rock reactions may affect a geothermal reservoir in two important ways. One is the possihility of c1oe;p;inp. of the pore space in the vicinity of a reinjection well. The second concerns the long tern evolution of a geothermal system, for example, the development of a self -sealing cap rock. Two major types of reactions that may affect the porosity and permeability in the reservoir are dissolution- precipitation reactions and alteration reactions. Silica precipitation is the major self -sealing process in hot-water geothermal resevoirs (Vhite, 1973). The purpose of this work is to develop a mathematical model which can simulate the changes in porosity and permeability resultine from water -rock reactions in a geothermal reservoir. The model being developed describes the flow of hot water in an axially symmetric porous medium. The model is a vertical cross -section in r-z coordinates. For sirnplicitv, only a single dissolved chemical species is heing modeled. The fluid is single -phase water and only dissolution and precipitation of quartz are considered. The kinetics for silica are those developed hy Pimstidt and Rarnes (1979) and Rlmstidt (1979). The Rasic The set of hasic partial differential equations that descrihes a hot water geothermal system are the fluid mass balance (continuitv equation), the fluid momentum balance (narcv's Law), the thermal energy balance, and the dissolved species mass balance erruations. Addjtjonal conditions needed to fully describe the physics and chemistry are an equation of state (that is, density as a known function of pressnre, temperature, and concentration) , constitutive relations for fluid and rock, chemical rate equations, and initial and boundary condjtions. In addition, the rate of cban~e of porosity and permeahility as a function of the reaction must be derived. The final set of partial differential equations is formulated in terms of fluid pressure, temperature, and concentration. Since exact solutions are too idealized, an approximate method is necessary. The method used is a' numerjcal method in which the spatial derivatives are -275- . approximated using a Calerkin finite -element method and the temporal derivatives are approximated using a qi.nite- difference method. Changes in Porosity and Permeability To model changes in porosity and permeability it is necessary that changes in porosjlty he expressed in terms of hulk pore volume changes in the porous medium due to dissolution or precipitation. Furthermore, it is assumed that the changes in permeahil.ity can he directly related to changes in porosity hy some emplrical. or theoretical relationship between permeahility and porosity.

The rate constants are exponential functions of temperature. Pumerj cal Method ?he numerical method used to solve for pressure, temperature, and concentration is based on the finite- element method. The essential features of this method are: 1) The spatial derivatives are approximated using a modified Calerkin finite-element method in which upstream weightinp: of the convective terms is used. 2) The temporal derivatives are approximated using a hackward (implicit) finite difference in time. 3) Concentration, temperature, and pressure are solved for sequentially in a manner similar to that outlined hp Coats et al. (1974) for finite difference methods. Solving for concentration, temperature, and pressure in that order allows the coefficient matrix for the spatial derivatives to he symmetric. The method also requires lumpinF of the ttme derjvative matrices. -277- 4) The convective terms in the temperature and concentration equations are evaluated at the new time level using a linearized semi-implicit method. This allows reasonably large time steps without changing the symmetry of the matrices. 5) The reaction term in the concentration equation is treated semi-implicitly. Examples The model has been tested against some analytical solutions. The solution for pressure has been compared to the Theis solution from groundwater hydrology (Theis, 1935). The solution for temperature has been compared to an analytical solution to the problem of hot fluid injection into an aquifer, includin)? the effect of conductive heat loss through the confining beds (Avdonin, 1964). A modification of the Avdonin solution without leakage was used to test the solution of the concentration equation. All three finite element solutions cornpared favorably to the analytical solutions. The diFferentia1 rate equation for quartz was integrated analytically over time at constant temperature. This was compared to computed concentrations for conditions of no flow and constant temperature. The accuracy of the concentrations computed by the finite element model under these conditions is dependent on the size of the time step. The relationship between the temperature and the concentration solutions and how this effects the reaction rate for quartz dissolution-precipltation was ~tudied through a series of one-dimensional problems. In these problems, the fronts are caused by the injection of hot water into a cooler aquifer, with the initial flulrls saturated with silica. The results sugpest that the temperature solution controls the rate of the quartz precipitation -dissolution reaction in two basic ways. First, the reaction rate is rapid enough that the curvature of the concentration front basically follows that of the temperature front. This implies that thermal dispersion (conductivity) of the reservoir is relatively more important than silica dispersion in controlling the reaction. Precipitation tends to occur on the upstream side of the fronts where hot water mixes with cold water. This results in decreased porosity and permeability in the vicinity of the well. The second way in which the temperature solrrtion controls the reaction rate is through the exponential temperature dependence of the rate constants. The result is that the reaction rate Is more sensitive to chanpes in concentration and temperature at higher temperatures. -278- We are presently in the process of designing two- dimensional problems with the purpose of modeling self- sealing in a reservoir.

Brownell, Jr. Systems, Science and Software, La Jolla, California For the last several years, the University of Texas at Austin (UTA) has analyzed the geopressured tertiary sandstones along the Texas Gulf Coast with the objective of locating prospective reservoirs from which geothermal energy could be recovered. Of the \"geothermal fair- ways \" (areas with thick sandstone bodies and estimated temperatures in excess of 3OO0F), the Brazoria fairway appears most promising and the Austin Bayou Prospect has been developed within this fairway-l A test well (DOE 1 Martin Ranch) is currently being drilled in this area. Pend- ing the availability of actual well test data, estimated reservoir prop- erties have been employed in numerical simulations to study the effects of variations in reservoir properties on the projected long-term be- havior of the Austin Bayou Prospect. The simulations assess the sensi - tivity of the reservoir behavior to variations in estimated sandstone/ shale distribution, shale compressibility, and vertical shale pemeablity. Further, hypothetical properties for the stress -deformation behavior of the rock formations were employed in a very preliminary study of the po- tential ground surface displacements th.at might accompany fluid produc - tion. AUSTIN BAYOU PROSPECT It is estimated that the Austin Bayou Prospect has a total sand- stone thickness of 800-900 ft, average permeability (from unconfined cores) of 40-60 md, fluid temperature in the range of 300'F (at 14,000 ft depth) to 350'F (at 16,500 ft), and salinities in the range of 40,000 -100,000 ppm. It is estimated th,at the test well will drain several sandstone reservoirs (zones A, B, C, D, E and F in Figure 1) in an area of approximately 16 square mi1es.l inferred from an interpolated spontaneous potential log, is 840 ft. Average porosity of at least 0.20 is predicted for 250 ft of the sand- stone; the remaining sandstone has a porosity of between 0.05-0.20 with an average value of 0.15. The total pclre volume, water in pores, and gas in place are estimated to be 60 billion cubic ft, 10 billion bbl, and 426 billion cubic ft, respectively. The net sandstone thickness, RESERVOIR RESPONSE CALCULATIONS It is likely that the test well will first be used to produce from sand bodies located within a single zone; the simulations consider pro- duction to be entirely from Zone E whicih has the thickest sandstone bodies (50-100 ft).

MUSHRM includes treatment of all the import.ant fluid/rock response mechanisms and their interactions, that are believed to be operative in Gulf Coast geopressured geothermal reservoirs. The reservoir is assumed to be a cylindrical disc with radius R = 3.63 km (corresponding to a block area of 16 square miles) and height 152.4 m (500 ft, corresponding to the top and bottom of Zone E at depths of 15,300 and 15,800 ft, respectively). The net sand thickness (= net shale thickness) is 76.2 m (250 ft). The reservoir fluid is assumed to be liquid water saturated with methane. The initial pore pressure, temperature and methane mass fraction at a depth of 15,500 ft are 793 bars (11,500 psi), 162.7OC (325OF) and 0.007, respectively. static equilibrium so that the initial values of pore pressure and methane mass fraction vary slightly over the 500 ft reservoir thickness. The reservoir is produced at a constant mass rate of 36.8 kg/sec (20,000 STB/ day); all of the production is from the sandstone layers. The reservoir fluid is assumed to be initially in hydro - For the sandstone layers we assume horizontal permeability = 20 md; vertical permeability = 2 md; grain density of rock = 2.63 g/cm3; initial porosity of rock = 0.20; rock thermal conductivity = 5.25 ergs/sec-cm-'C; rock specific heat = 0.963 X lo7 ergs/g-'C; rock bulk compressibility = 7.25 X gas saturation = 0.0. permeabilities, in the case of two-phase flow, using the Corey formula - tion. sand layers except for horizontal permeability, vextical permeability and rock bulk compressibility. These properties, as well as the sequencing of the sandstone/shale layers, are varied in the four MUSHRM calculations. cm2/dynes; irreducible liquid saturation = C.3 and irreducible The latter two parameters define the relative For the shale layers we assume identical properties as for the Figure 2 shows the numerical grid, along with the sandstone/shale arrangement, used in simulation #1 (base case). In simulation #2 (thick sands), the arrangement shown in Figure 3 was used. For these two cases the shale layers are assumed to have horizontal permeability = 10-4 md; vertical permeability = cm2/dynes. vertical permeability of the shale layer is increased ten-fold to md. Simulation #4 (small shale C) is the same as #1 except the bulk rock compressibility of the shale layers is decreased ten-fold to 14.5 X 10-11 cm2/dynes. md; rock bulk compressibility = 14.5 X 10-l' Simulation #3 (high shale kv) is the same as #1 except the Figure 4 shows the time-dependent pressure decline in the various sandstone well-blocks for all four MUSHRM simulations. For simulation #1 (base case) the pressure drops in well-blocks (i = 1, j = 2, 4, 9) are essentially the same but differ substantially from those in well-blocks (i = I, j = 6, 7). This clearly illustrates the influence of fluid in- flux from the adjoining shales. Layers j = 2, 4, 9 are each a 50 ft thick sandstone body sandwiched between shale layers, whereas layers j = 6, 7 are contiguous sandstone bodies with a total thickness of 100 ft. We further note, however, that the pressure drop for all of the sandstone layers is very nearly identical for the first year or two; influx from -281 - adjoining shales should have little 01: no effect for practical drawdown/ buildup times employed in well testing. Simulation #2 (thick sands) USES the same estimated properties for the sandstone and shale layers as for the base case, but the net sandstone of 250 ft is a single thick body sandwiched between 125 ft thick shale bodies. As shown in Figure 4, the pressure drops in the sandstone layers comprising the 250 ft: thick body are essentially identi - cal. The drop is nearly the same as for simulation #1 (base case) for t < 'L 2 years; this again indicates that the fluid influx from shale layers will be important only for long production times. years, higher pressure drops are obtained for simulation #2 (thick sands); the importance of fluid influx from the shales decreases with increasing sandstone thickness. Comparison of simulation #3 (high shale kv) with the base case shows that the ten-fold increase in the vertical permeabil - ity of the shale layers enhances the fluid influx and thus greatly re- duces the long-term pressure drop in the sandstone well-blocks (Figure 4). Nevertheless, the influence of the influx is minimal for t < Q 1 year. Finally, comparison of the results for simulation #4 (small shale C) with the base case shows that a ten-fold decrease in the bulk rock com- pressibility of the shale layers causes a larger pressure drop in the sandstone well-blocks; this effect, however, becomes evident only for t > 'L 10 years. For t > 3 The MUSHRM simulator computes porosity along with the fluid state in each computational cell at each stage of a calculation. Given current and initial porosities, the radial variation of the vertical compaction of the reservoir may be computed; the compaction at t = 30.3 years is depicted in Figure 5 for each of the four reservoir simulations. PRELIMINARY SUBSIDENCE STUDIES Estimation of the vertical (subsidence) and horizontal movements of the ground surface that might accompany reservoir compaction requires knowledge of the stress-deformation behavior of the rock units constitut - ing the reservoir (Zone E) and the overlying and underlying strata. Since such data were not available, hypothetical properties were used in the S3 AGRESS simulator which couples the reservoir response model (MUSHRM) with a rock stress -deformation response model.2 Figure 6 shows an axial section of the configuration treated. expected to enter the geopressured zone at a depth of approximately 10,000 ft. above that depth the rocks may be unconsolidated. Accordingly, the formation properties of the rocks surrounding the reservoir are permitted to be different in Region I (depth < 1.0,OOO ft) and Region I1 (depth > 10,000 ft) for the ground movement studies. The test well is Rocks are likely to be competent in the geopressured zone; We assume that the Zone E sandstone/shale layer arrangement, forma - In tion properties, initial fluid state, and the imposed fluid production are identical to those used for reservoir simulation #1 (base case). addition to the reservoir formation properties given earlier, we assume -282- the following stress -deformation properties for the reservoir sandstone (shale) layers: bulk modulus of porous rock = 9.20 kb (0.46 kb); shear modulus of porous rock = 3.45 kb (0.17 kb); bulk modulus of rock grain = 300 kb (100 kb). Since the reservoir pore pressure declines monotonically during fluid production, the values selected are for loading conditions. The overburden/underburden rocks are assumed to be linearly three parametric AGRESS simulations were made to assess the effects of variations in rock properties. Case A (soft) treats both Region I and Region I1 as unconsolidated rock with bulk modulus = 25 kb and shear modulus = 9.375 kb. Case B (mixed) treats Region I the same as Case A, but assumes the geopressured zone is four times as stiff (Region I1 bulk modulus = 100 kb and shear modulus = 37.5 kb). In Case C (stiff), both Region I and Region I1 are treated as competent rock (i.e., bulk modulus 100 kb and shear modulus = 37.5 kb). elastic; The surface vertical and horizontal movements calculated by the The three AGRESS simulations at t = 30.3 years are shown in Figure 7. horizontal movement is directed toward the test well (r = 0). The com- bined effect of the movements is to form a subsidence bowl. The main ef- fect of an increase in rock stiffness is to reduce the surface displace - ments. Comparison of Figures 5 and 7 shows that only a small fraction of the resemoir compaction is calculated to appear as surface subsidence. CONCLUDING REMARKS The parametric geopressured reservoir simulations strongly suggest that for sandstone thicknesses greater than 50 ft, the effect of shale fluid influx will not be felt for production times less than one to two years. times practical in well testing, but the influx from shales will likely play an important role in determining long-term pressure drop in the sandstones, and also in the associated reservoir compaction. The parametric ground surface displacement simulations suggest that only a fraction of the reservoir compaction will appear as surface subsidence. It should be emphasized that the estimated values for reservoir properties used in the reservoir response calculations must be confirmed by data from the DOE 1 Martin Ranch test well. the ground surface movements are even more tenuous since they are based upon hypothetical overburden/underburden rock properties.

Pinder** 1.0 Introduction The simulation of geothermal reservoirs involves the solution of the equa- tions describing multiphase, non-isothermal flow in porous media. These equa- tions are highly nonlinear, particularly as the solution encounters the boundary of the two-phase region. There are essentially as many ways of accommodating this nonlinearity as there are numerical models of geothermal reservoirs. How- ever, there is no universally accepted method for establishing the relative accuracy of these techniques. Well-established methodologies such as Fourier analysis and comparison against analytical solutions are simply not applicable to nonlinear systems. A necessary but not sufficient condition for convergence is the conservation of mass energy and momentum. This information is generally provided as an integral part of the numerical solution. 2.0 Governing Equations geothermal reservoirs is: One possible form of the equations governing mass and energy transport in d kk p2 kk p2 + rw w, ,g 0 {[(t) SsSwpspw(hs-hw) 1-IW - - (: kkrw - \") kk - K ($) rpff - (K-kyhf) - v - hf swl-lw ssl-ls energy !Pf *Dept. of Water Resources Eng., The Royal Institute of Technology, S-100 44, Stockholm 70, Sweden. ~. **Dept. of Civil Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, N.

The remaining thermodynamic properties, e.g., PsY Pw, in terms of hf and pf through highly nonlinear relationships. The degree of nonlinearity is apparent in Fig. 1, where a few of the nonlinear coeffici - ents are presented: kk p kk p +- ap c2 5 e(~) hf Note that at the boundary between the water and two-phase regions the nonlinear coefficients are actually multi -valued, some with a range of several orders of magnitude. Similar relationships are observed for the other nonlinear coeffi - cients on Eqns. (1) and (2). When these coefficients are not handled care- fully, instability, oscillations, and non-convergence in the numerical solution result in the neighborhood of the two-phase boundary. Let us now examine this phenomenon in detail, using the hypothetical step- function coefficient C(H) illustrated in Fig. 2. The behavior of C as a function of the thermodynamic variable H exhibits two undesirable traits: (a) the step does not propagate accurately as a function of H; (b) the value of C is hypersensitive to the value of H. If we assume a simple analytical relationship for H, i.e., H(x,t) = (ax+b)(ct+d), we would observe the propagation of C(x,t) illustrated in Fig. 3(a). However, when this contin - uous solution is replaced by a finite element approximation, such as illustra - ted in Fig. 3(b), the nonlinear coefficient is propagated as shown in Fig. 3(c). The numerical scheme clearly introduces a serious error in the propagation of this coefficient. -287- 4.0 The Inverse Iteration Method This numerical difficulty can be overcome if one employs a weighted -average value of C(H). We will define C(H) at any node i by ow+- c-) + c- Y when the step lies within the region of influence of node i. We will address the problem of computing 0 later. A judicious choice of 0 generates the step function propagation illustrated in Fig. 4. Notice that now the step travels with a velocity almost exactly equal to the original smooth velocity shown in Fig. 3(a). To demonstrate the hypersensitivity of C(H), a one-dimensional experiment was conducted. A phase change from water to steam takes place at some point in the domain. Because no constraints were imposed on the system, the solution exhibited instability and oscillations at nodes near the region where the step change in coefficients occurred. It was olbserved that on some time steps the node nearest the step change in C(H), node k, oscillated exactly between solutions located on either side of the step (H + E and H - E of Fig. 2). The associated coefficient oscillation was between C+ and C . When the coef- ficient was held arbitrarily to tained for node k. The solution, however, was H - E, which is compatible with the coefficient C . When C(H) was arbitrarily held at C , a solution H = & was obtained; this is compatible with the coefficient C+. This per- feet oscillation suggests that H + E and H - E do not represent the cor- rect solution, and that C anc C are not the appropriate coefficients. The correct solution at node k must be exactly at the coefficient step, i.e., H and the correct coefficient value must lie between C+ and C . This hypothe - sis was tested by trying different values of 0, 0 < 0 < 1, to determine whether there was one value which would yield a solution value was indeed obtained,and demonstrated that it was possible to have a set of C(H) and H which was self-consistent in the sense that they both were located at the step function change.

Oscillatory and non-convergent solutions are sometimes encountered for selected nodes and time steps. The correct solution may reside exactly on the two-phase boundary and require coefficient values which are neither those of the single -phase region nor the two-phase region, but rather a weighted average of the two.

With most substances heterogeneous nucleation is dominant, and homogene - ous nucleation is very slow, rare in nature, and difficult to study in the laboratory. The precipitation of amorphous si 1 ica is a,n apparent exception to this because of the very low surface tension of the silica -water inter - face - between 35 and 50 ergs cm-2 over the range of major practical interest. (By comparison, the surface tension of the water -air interface is about 70-80 ergs cm-2.) This means that enormous numbers of particles can be produced by homogeneous nucleatioln (on the order 1017 to 10l8 per 1 iter), and this completely swamps the effects of heterogeneous nucleation. A practical consequence of the dominance of homogeneous nuc eation is that the precipitation of amorphous silica is experimentally repro - ducible and predictable. is determined by basic thermodynamic and chemical variables (concentration, surface tension, etc.) and not by often unknown trace contaminants as is the case with heterogeneous nucleation. This is because the rate of homogeneo s nucleation Figure 1 shows some typical experimental results which depict the decline of dissolved silica with time via the homogeneous nucleation mechanism. These experiments were performed at various pH's in a low sa;l inity buffered medium in which the sodium ion activity was approximately 0.069M, and the time scales were shifted to convert all data to a nominal pH of 7.0.

With small saturation ratios (0.5g/1 corresponds to S=1.9 at this temperature), massive precipitation will not occur within the process equipment, but just as certainly will occur somewhere further downstream. Also note that 0.5 and 0.7g/1 curves show an induction period during which the concentration does not change noticeably. We have generated a large quantity of such nucleation data from room temperature to 100\u00b0C and have written a computer program which can numerically (and rigorously) model the homogeneous nucleation process; i.e., it can reproduce the curves in Fig. 1.

The first effect increases It will be discussed in detail Except at very low salinity, most of the dissociated silanols on the silica surface have cations bound to them - in the case of our experiments, sodium. This means that sodium and hydrogen ion activity do independent effects upon the rate; rather, it is the ratio of sodium to hydrogen activity that is important. calculate the effect of salinity upon the molecular deposition rate as well. have Therefore, Figure 3 may be used to To do this, calculate a \"nominal pH value \" defined by pH nom = pH + 'log - [Na+l 0.069 and then read off the pH correction factor from Figure 3 using the nominal pH value instead of the real one. For example, to calculate the molecular deposition rate at 100\u00b0C, pH 6.5, [Na+j = 0.69M and 0.7g/l dissolved silica: First, read the deposition rate at pH7.0 and [Nat] = 0.069M from Figure 2. This value is 0.22 pm/day. above. Third, read the pH correction factor for pH 7.5 from Second, calculate pH nom using the equation This is 7.5. -296- Figure 3; this is 1.8. Finally, multiply the two numbers together to obtain the deposition rate which is 0.40 pm/day. Our data suggest that this procedure is adequate for solutions which contain up to at least 1M NaC1, and it may be (Idequate at even higher salinities. However, it cannot be recommended for use at salinities much below 5200 ppm. At very low salinities dissociation without ion pairing becomes important , and the basic assumption of the equivalent and opposite effects of hydrogen and sodium activity collapses. We hope to remedy this shortcoming by detailed rednalysis of the low salinity surface charge data in the literature. The dissol ved sol ids in real geothermal brl nes are usually predominantly sodium chloride, but other salts are also present. We have found that, in most cases, it is sufficient to use an \"effective sodium ion activity \" calculated as 0.77 times the (molar) concentration of chloride. ate is present as a major ion, use the sum of %he chloride and bicarbonate concentrations in place of chloride alone. The rationale for this procedure is that the various other major cations that may be present have essentially the same effects as sodium, and the activity lowering effects of divalent anions approximately compensate for the concentration of the cations that accompany them. If bicarbon - IV. Some Practical Examples; or, How Not to Re.inject Case 1): Consider a hypothetical geothermal devel opment at the brine contains 5200 ppm NaCl , 0.5g/1 dissolved SiO2, and is delivered to the reinjection well at 75OC and pH 7. The brine delivered to the reinjection well is completely clear and goes right through a membrane filter. The decision is made to reinject. Reinjection commences at 4OOt/hr temperatu e, 8=O.l, h=20 m 12 days the thermal front is about 60 meters into the formation, and the fluid travel time from wellbore to thenrial front is about 50 hour = 3,000 minutes. Referring to Figure 1, we see that there is now ample time for homogeneous nucleation to occur before the fluid reaches the thernial front. The result is that the injectability of that horizon is damaged by silica precipitation. Furthermore, well treatments with caustic or HF are not effective because the damage is 30 to 60 meters away from the wellbore. and volumetric solid rock heat capacity = 2460kj/m 5 C. After about Case 2): Can one reinject straight from the first stage steam separators at Cerro Prieto? Assume the following typical br-ine well: 160\u00b0C, 0.95 g/1 effective [Na'l = 0.25, and neyliyible suspended solids. is not known, but is approximately 7.8 at room temperature. a nominal pH of about 8.3 (which is within the range of weak pH dependence) and a pH factor of 2.7 (from Fig. 3). read from Fig. 2 as about 1.3p/day. actual deposition rate of 3.5wlday = 1.3 mm/year. with the observed rate of vitreous silica deposition near the separators at Cerro Prieto. Because pore permeability is dominant at Cerro Prieto, it is clear that injecting this brine would rapidly plug the injection well. The brine pH at injection temperature This gives The pH nom = 7.0 deposition rate is Correcting for pH, we obtain the This is consistent -297- We hope that such mistakes will be avoided. However, we emphasize that both of these brine streams would be deemed injectible under the criteria presently in vogue: a micron -sized membrane filter and would not cause visible fouling of metal surfaces during field tests of a few days duration. It is precisely the refinement of such criteria that we hope to have accomplished with the work surnmarized here. they would be able to pass freely through Ac k now1 edgeme nt s Energy of the U. S.

Pruess, R.C. Schroeder, J. Zerzan 'Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory University of California Berkeley, California 94720 In recent years, a number of numerical simulators for geothermal reservoirs have been developed. these is to aid reservoir engineers in (i) determining characteristic parameters of reservoirs (most important among those being the reserves of fluid and heat), and (ii) simulating the performance of reservoirs upon production and injection. The general purpose of The various simulators differ in the approximations made in the underlying physical model (e.g., dependence of rock and fluid properties upon thermodynamic variables) , in the geometrical def inition of the reservoir (one-, two-, or three -dimensional, regular or irregular shape), in the choice of thermodynamic variables, and in the matheniatical techniques used for solving the coupled mass and energy transport equations, Criteria for desirable performance of numerical simulators depend in part upon the particular problems to be investigated. Different problems will often differ in the required level of detail to be resolved, and in the optimum balance of speed and accuracy of computation. media from model studies for idealized systems. performed with less-than-three-dimensional models, and algorithms which are based on regular grid spacings will be perfectly acceptable.

Tsang and C.F. Tsang Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Berkeley, California 94720 I. Introduction Various aspects of reinjection of cooled geothermal water into the geothermal reservoir have been studied by many authors. question of practical relevance is the calculation of reinjection pressures required. These pressures on the one hand determine the pumping requirements which are important inputs to the technical and economical feasibilities of the project. On the other hand, they may also be used as baseline data. As time goes on, if the pressure measured becomes much in excess of the calculated values, some kind of plugging may be occurring and remedial action would have to be taken. One For isothermal cases where the injected water is at the same temperature as the reservoir water, the pressure change is simply given by the Theis solution in terms of an exponential integral. shows that this pressure change is directly proportional to the viscosity. temperature. viscosity changes by a factor of 3 (whereas the density of water changes by about 20%). The solution It turns out that the viscosity is a strong function of Over a range of temperatures from 100\u00b0C to 25OoC, the This is illustrated in Figure 1. The injection of cold water into a hot reservoir is a moving boundary problem. On the inside of a boundary enclosing the injection well, the parameters correspond to that of the injected cold water; and on the outside, the parameters correspond to that of the reservoir hot water. conduction between the hot and cold water. depends on the aquifer heat conductivity and capacity, and it increases with time as the boundary (or cold temperature front) moves outward from the injection well. The boundary is, of course, not sharp because of heat The width of the boundary There exist numerical models to solve such a problem. In an earlier work, we made a simple study using numerical model \"CCC\" developed at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. shown in Figure 1. a problem when several approximations are applied. obtained in terms of well-known functions or in terms of one integral.

Thus, the The present analytical approach will Derivation of the governing equation, will be given in the following section where the this function will be represented by a Fermi-Dirac function, whose parameters are determined based upon physical considerations.

If we assume a sharp temperature front between the cold injected water and the hot reservoir water, then the location of this transition from KI to KR is given by: The function characterizes the range of z over which K(z) is appreciably The derivative dK/dz is a symmetrical The full-width half-maximum of dK/dz about This be- Near the wellbore 2 'aC, Qt = ?rr h - pwcw where Pw, &, Pa, Ca are the densities and heat capacities of water and aquifer, respectively. Eq. (12) implies a constant value for r2/t = d, given by: which is the same parameter d used in the Fermi -Dirac function. The fact that the temperature front is not sharp is accounted for by the width of variation from KI to KR, given earlier by the parameter a. Avdonin has solved the problem of the propagation of temperature front with the injection of hot water into cold water in an aquifer. In the limit, where there is no vertical heat loss, Avdonin's solution is given by: T-TR -- erfc (0) T -T r (V) - 0 IR where T = initial aquifer temperature TI = temperature of injection fluid K = aquifer conductivity.

(11) to be intimately related to (T-TR)/(T1-Tp) here. we may relate the widths of dK(z)/dz and' (d/dz) (T-TR) / (TI-TR). The full-width half the curve d/dz(T-TR)/(TI-TR) is governed by a transcendental equation. However, in the limit of \"narrow width,\" the full-width half -maximum can be shown to be 44~a/(Ca~a). Equating the two full-width half -maxima, we arrive at the simple expression : In particular, K a a = 1.605 - 'ap a which relates the parameter a, in the theoretical model for K(z), to the physical property of the aquifer.

The early data may first be compared with the curve for t/r2 = l/d yielding kh and $6h values. Matching of later data will give parameter d from which h may be estimated (see Eq. 13). Thus, k, $6, and h are evaluated. Of course, in actual field -data analysis other possible effects (e.g., boundaries) may enter and great care has to be exercised. V. Summary A governing equation is obtained assuming temperature -dependent viscosity. The solution is obtained by assuming the parameter k/p to be a Fermi -Dirac function of r2/t. The constants in the function are related to the cold water injection problem by a comparison with Avdonin's solution. The result displays an interesting transient pressure curve which initially (small t/r2 values) follows the Theis solution with parameters corresponding to reservoir hot water and at large t/r2 values, turns and becomes parallel to the Theis solution with cold water parameters. Use of these results for cold water injection well-test analysis is briefly discussed. Work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy.

Zyvolski\" and M.J. O'Sullivan University of Auckland, New Zealand Abstract The governing equations for a two phase geothermal reservoir are presented for the case when a substantial amount of carbon dioxide is present. Sample results for a model reservoir based on the Broadlands geothermal field are given. Introduction The Broadlands geothermal field is the next field in New Zealand which will be extensively developed. Like the Bagnore field in Italy and the Ngawha field in New Zealand, the Broadlands field is characterized by a relatively high (2-4% by mass) content of carbon dioxide. The presence of carbon dioxide has depressed the boiling surface sufficiently deep to make the production zone two phase. Because of the importance of the gas content in influencing the design of geothermal energy conversion systems it is important to understand and to predict the behaviour of carbon dioxide in the reservoir. Lumped parameter models of gassy (carbon dioxide) geothermal reservoirs have recently been studies l2 are sensitive to changes in the carbon dioxide content. This report presents some of the initial results of a simulation of the behaviour of a multi -dimensional carbon dioxide dominated reservoir. They have shown that the reservoir properties Basic Field Equations A thorough discussion of the governing equations for the carbon dioxide water geothermal system is given by Zyvoloski and O'S~llivan.~ only the final results (see notation section).

RESULTS mo examples were chosen t inv -334- tigat the ffect of the presence of carbon dioxide on reservoir behaviour. The first is a hypothetical two- phase, two-dimensional reservoir with field properties similar to those found in the Broadlands (New Zealand) geothermal field. The data for the problem are given in Table 1. The problem is similar to one considered previously for a pure water field by Faust and Mercer', Toronyi and Farouq Alia and Thomas and Piersong. The results in Figures 1 and 2 give contours for pressure and saturation, after the field has been discharging for 500 days. The results clearly show that the pressure changes are propagated more rapidly across the field when carbon dioxide is present corresponding to a decrease in the compressibility of the fluid. The second example considered was designed to test the effect of carbon dioxide on the short term transient behaviour of a geothermal aquifer. data for the problem are given in Table 2. Two initial liquid saturations of The 0.99, 0.2 and three initial carbon dioxide contents are considered. The pressure of the wellbore as a function of time for these six cases is shown in Figures 3 and 4. (Figure 3) and low saturation (Figure 4) can be explained in terms of the carbon dioxide content. With a high liquid saturation there is a very small amount of carbon dioxide in the discharge (see equation 18) because the discharge is mainly from the liquid phase in which the carbon dioxide content is small. In this situation the carbon dioxide primarily affects the system by decreasing the compressibility of the two-phase fluid. At the low liquid saturation the discharge comes mainly from the vapour phase and is rich in carbon dioxide. This removal of carbon dioxide, or \"de-gassing'', dominates the pressure response and consequently the pressure drops significantly as a result of the decrease of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the vapour. Figures 5 and 6 show the radial pressure profiles at the different saturations. The compressibility and de-gassing effects are evident. The qualitative difference between the behaviour at high saturation CONCLUSIONS The spatial behaviour of gas-dominated reservoirs is substantially different The qualitative behaviour of the pressure transients from pure water reservoirs. is affected by the saturation and the presence of carbon dioxide. Careful monitoring of the gas content in the discharge may be required to allow correct interpretation of pressure transients in gassy geotherrilal fields. -335- Nomenclature and Notation A D H k n P 4 R S T t U @ P U Subscripts Ac cumul at ion te rm Transmissibility Enthalpy Field permeability Mass fraction carbon dioxide Field pressure Sink Re la tive permeability Saturation Temperature Time Specific internal energy Field porosity Density Viscosity C - carbon dioxide m e - energy R - liquid phase V - vapour phase r - rock mass - -336- REFERENCES 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.
