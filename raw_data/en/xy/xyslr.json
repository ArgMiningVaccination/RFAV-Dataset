But the rules and routines were not intended to create a single path for all. Discovering an individual practice of Ayurveda is a journey of self-knowledge, during which the path to healing reveals itself. However, ultimate well-being requires integrated medicine: Joining modern Western medicine with the holistic lifestyle science of Ayurveda. My goal is to build a bridge between separate worlds of medicine. I believe that together they are exponentially more powerful than the sum of their parts. As an author, practitioner, and speaker, I aim to equip doctors, practitioners, and patients with the tools to approach healing as the holistic, individualized path that it is. "}
