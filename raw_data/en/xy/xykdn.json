Nine years later, and those herbal remedies and holistic solutions can now be found in homes across the globe. A unique opportunity for both inexperienced and experienced herbalists who want to develop the skills of herbal medicine, home remedies, and natural healing to build an at-home apothecary. Natural tinctures, organic supplements, and herbal teas that nourish and heal the body naturally. Beeswax lip balms, goat milk soaps, and organic face serums to naturally revitalize skin. Crystals and gemstones, foraging tools, and books about medicinal plants, edible weeds, and wildcrafting. Soy wax candles and 100% therapeutic grade essential oils to introduce fragrant aromas into the home. Handcrafted hemp-based skincare, herbal prerolls, and CBD oil tinctures to provide natural remedies for any everyday ailment. Exceptional quality, love that this is a safe and healthy alternative for my family opposed to the store/salon bought conditioner. My hair is silky and smooth, this stuff is amazing. I love that I can customize my conditioner to include a delicious scent. "}
