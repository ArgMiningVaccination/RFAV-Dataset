Plants and mushrooms provide adaptogenic actions. When consumed, these plants target specific stressors in your body. There are three qualities that plants must have to be an adaptogen: - It is non-toxic when taken in normal doses. - It helps your body cope with stress. - It allows your body to return to balance (homeostasis). Adaptogens work as a temporary bandage but aren't the solution to long-term stress. What do adaptogens do to my body? The goal of taking adaptogens is to return your body back to a state of balance (homeostasis). The herbal action in adaptogens increases or decreases chemical reactions within your body. For example, if you're stressed (elevated cortisol), an adaptogen will respond by reducing cortisol levels. If you experience chronic fatigue with low cortisol levels, an adaptogen will increase the level of cortisol in your body. Are adaptogens regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration? While some adaptogens like ashwagandha and Asian ginseng have a number of studies on their varied actions, supplements are not regulated by FDA, and FDA approval does not equate to safety. If you plan to add plants with adaptogenic qualities to your diet, talk with your healthcare provider to discuss how they could impact your health and if they are right for you. What types of adaptogens exist?

In addition, this type of ginseng combats stress and boosts your nervous system, which improves how your body responds to stimuli (fight or flight). Some studies suggest American ginseng can reset dopamine levels and regulate your mood. - Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera): [Ashwagandha](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-is-ashwagandha/)has a positive effect on the endocrine, nervous, immune and cardiovascular systems by regulating your metabolism and helping you relax by calming how your brain responds to stress.
