Reviews by Course Participants \"Awesome way to be introduced to meditation! Daily emails with the gradual build of duration made it easy to follow. Having the downloads available for later use is also great!\" \"This was a great experience! I didn't need to leave the house to learn, although still felt connected with Lance and students. These really helped me to understand meditation in a real life way. And committing to the 10 days helped me to be disciplined. It has motivated me to continue to keep this practice. Thank you!\" \"Thank you for offering this course. I feel as though my daily meditation practice has been re-booted. It has renewed my faith that a dedicated and consistant meditation practice can be truly healing - physically, emotionally and spiritually.\" \"I loved the meditations! I want to share them with my mom, and others who have long given up on meditation as something they don't feel they can do. The guidance around not needing a quiet mind was so helpful, and so often where we get stuck. Loved the ease of the guidance.\" \"I LOVE listening to Lance's voice, and the balance of quiet and instruction in them is just perfect. I did notice some carry over into my day after doing the meditation - I would sometimes feel like my presence and emotional resilience were stronger. The meditation instructions themselves are simple and carry a sense potential for infinite expansion. Thank you, Lance, for your very generous encouragement and easy to implement teachings.\" \"I could totally feel the difference in my presentation and how I met the kids I work with when i did the meditation in the morning.
