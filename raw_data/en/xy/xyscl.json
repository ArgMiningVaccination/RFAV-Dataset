This course builds on Social Therapy I in which students became aware of the importance of the social context of the human for their well-being, including the ideals and practices within a Camphill community which support therapeutic living for every human being and especially those with disabilities. The focus of this course is the second series of Village conference lectures by Karl Koenig as well as other texts, through which the student gains insight into the process into adulthood, which brings human beings into relationships with the world, and how that can be brought into balance through social therapy.

This course focuses on questions of the transition from education to vocation, of the morality of work, of individual destiny versus the social context as well as the creation of viable and authentic work opportunities for mentally challenged individuals.

The student will keep a journal of these meetings. This culminates in a festive biography-sharing event, including relatives and friends. The student is also expected to create a written text, outlining the actual biography as well as the learning process of working with the project partner. In this, the student is expected to demonstrate an understanding of the underlying principles of biography as developed out of anthroposophy and bring forward a leading image of the individual.

This third year project is a practical initiative upon which the fourth year final project is based.

This could be, for example, in the field of agriculture, crafts, home life, community bulding, therapy, the arts etc. This is not merely an activity, but an action-research, based on a question, for instance \"How can the art of drama enhance healing for the individual and the group?\" The student will keep a journal of the process of this activity, which should unfold over a period of at least four months. The group will give a demonstration of their research activity at the end of the Third Year.
