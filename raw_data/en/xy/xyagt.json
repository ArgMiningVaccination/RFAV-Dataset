Although it is not anti-vaccine; it does suggest we quickly replace the preservative thimerosal with a non-toxic substance as a preservative. The film is a fast paced tour meeting leading scientists, parents of autistic children, and the director, Eric Gladen's, own family who all attest to the horrible side-effects of mercury poisoning. Fortunately, the viewer is left with hope and the knowledge that Gladen is now well. Robert Kennedy Jr., the bold man who has helped clean up our rivers from mercury toxicity due to factory waste products is behind this extraordinary film. He's intimately aware of the dangers of mercury and is a man of the people. During his quest to clean up the environment, he met a woman who inspired him to look at the neurological damage in humans due to mercury toxicity. Kennedy's now a passionate spokesperson for the need to avoid any way we inhale, ingest, or allow mercury into our bodies. Eric Gladen (above), personally tells his own scary, agonizing tale of mercury poisoning. This story punctuates the wider mystery of secrets and distortions around mercury used in medicine. It was Eric's personal journey that led him to consult top scientists and researchers all over the USA. He was desperate to find a cure for himself and others who struggled with similar problems. The result: a very intelligent, and human full-length documentary that connects the dots. Watch it and you'll understand more of the cause of the pandemic of autism. Even better, you'll learn about therapies that work to remove all symptoms of autism, and the people who supervise these therapies. Sandwiched in between these epiphanies is the sticky mess of politics, corruption and greed that led to the situation we're in now in which one in 68 kids is now diagnosed with autism. \"No\", Gladen asserts, \"we don't have to give up life-saving vaccinations; we just have to choose ways to get them without any additives that contain mercury.\" It's not that hard; there are alternatives to mercury that will do the job and not be toxic.
