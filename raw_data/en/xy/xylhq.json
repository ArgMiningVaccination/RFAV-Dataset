Abyssinian Development Corporation New York $1,001,000 \"CRASEL Expansion project addresses the social emotional needs of underserved students, using an innovative methodology that can be replicated for all underserved students across the State of New York. Innovative techniques that the project employs are: 1. Engagement of school leaders in self-reflective racial identity work such as creating a racial autobiography helps them understand how their own lived experiences influence their mindsets and leadership in the classroom, which leads to them modifying their curriculum, texts and topics so they are more culturally relevant and prioritize student identities. 2. PD (Professional Development) clearly focuses on implementation steps in SEL (Social Emotional Learning) and CRASEL (Culturally Responsive and Social Emotional Leadership) that are grounded in research-based best practices. This is innovative because there is currently no PD that focuses on implementation of SEL and CRASEL this way. 3. The CRASEL project includes calming practices such as student-led mindfulness that can dial down stressful situations and bring the focus back to learning. 4. Engagement of the adults in their own critical self-reflection, which does not typically happen, fosters positive relationships between families with school communities and education systems. 5. The development of the schools in a cohort model combines support with sustainability because leaders are supported over a period of time in professional learning communities with cycles of learning.\" Academy of Medical and Public Health Services Brooklyn $250,000 AMPHS' Adult Literacy, Civics and Workforce Preparedness Program will offer ESOL classes, citizenship classes, and digital literacy classes to 300-400 students per year.

Academy of Medical and Public Health Services Brooklyn $500,000 Amid an uncertain political environment and the COVID-19 pandemic, fears of deportation, separation, and loss permeate the community. Combined, these social factors become emotional stressors that contribute to the aggravated mental health status of our community members. The Immigrant Mental Health Initiative (\"IMHI\") aims to address the risk factors contributing to mental health issues in immigrant populations who live in the shadows, ineligible for public benefits and health insurance. Action for a Better Community, Inc. Monroe $100,000 ABC has 35 years of experience reaching low-income African American and Latinx populations that have not been responsive to traditional providers with HIV, STD, Hepatitis and sexual health services in the City of Rochester and Monroe County. HIV has been increasing in the City of Rochester since 2019, particularly with the simultaneous COVID19 and opioid/heroin epidemics, with the highest rates among young African American men. Rochester's low-income neighborhoods with limited access to health services also have higher rates of HIV, Hepatitis C and STDs. HIV tests have to be administered within a specific temperature range to be valid. ABC's attempts to find alternate street and neighborhood pop-up testing has not been successful due to lack of air conditioning. Access to a mobile unit where we can control the temperature of the testing environment and the privacy of the individuals tested would help resolve these issues. ABC would be able to increase CLIA waived HIV testing with risk reduction counseling and linkage to PrEP and other needed health services for highly impacted and under served populations. Action for a Better Community, Inc. Monroe $470,000 Action for a Better Community's location at 33 Chestnut Street, Rochester, NY which provides outpatient chemical dependency and HIV services to low income individuals, is in need of a roof replacement. The property was purchase in 2001 and has the roof that was in place at the date of purchase. Due to normal wear and tear, the roof has sections where it is leaking causing possible damage to the underlying decking and internally to the ceiling. Securing funding to make the necessary replacement will divert water and prevent structural damage which negatively impacts the facility and program operations with minimal repairs that will last approximately 20 years. In addition, the leaks can cause air quality issues if it creates mold buildup, which can cause health issues for both staff and more particularly customers with underlying existing health conditions. The programs in this building, the majority which are grant funded, do not provide enough funding to make necessary repairs and / or reserve a maintenance fund to replace the roof after its useful life. Action for a Better Community, Inc.

The integration of primary and behavioral health services has been the focus of recent trends in college health. Taking a more integrated approach to wellness may provide the best foundation for a holistic circle of care. Collaboration between counseling and health services may be instrumental in better detection and early treatment for a wide range of co-occurring disorders. Funds will be used for an on-campus renovation project to create a new 5,200 square foot Health and Wellness Center that will serve as a home for primary care and mental health services. The new center will provide holistic patient care, including far greater access to mental health care, for thousands of New Yorkers who attend Adelphi University.

Characterized by shared experiences, holistic supports, and continued engagement, cohort programs provide consistent contact opportunities between students, staff, and faculty, developmental programming, and the financial, social, emotional, and wellness support that has been shown to help keep students in school and on track to graduation. The CENS initiative, to be piloted for 500 incoming freshman in the Fall of 2022, will provide a newly envisioned baseline support structure for those who did not self-select into the existing cohort programs. Once enrolled, students will be assigned a support team who will guide goal achievement, address academic and financial difficulties, and ensure integration into the campus community. MetroCards, food vouchers, and stipends for textbooks will be provided as incentives and for those in need. Each student will have a personalized roadmap with program milestones that will complement enhanced supports and intentional tracking to keep them on the path to success.

Catholic Charities Community Services Archdiocese Bronx County $700,000 Terra Firma is a groundbreaking medical-legal-mental health partnership between Catholic Charities Community Services (CCCS) and Montefiore Medical Center which addresses the complex and urgent factors affecting the mental and behavioral health of unaccompanied immigrant children. Housed in a federally-qualified community health center, the program provides psychotherapy for individuals, families, and groups; primary healthcare; legal assistance for those in need of humanitarian immigration status; social programming such as English and nutrition classes, outings to museums, and recreational soccer; and referrals for additional social services. Unaccompanied immigrant children experience heightened rates of mental health conditions. Terra Firma offers not only traditional services by mental health professionals but also recovery support services and lasting solutions.

Catholic Charities of Orange, Sullivan & Ulster Sullivan County $390,000 The surge of substance use disorder has been referred to as the epidemic within the pandemic. Providing care for those struggling with the disease of addiction has resulted in an increased need for quality treatment and recovery programs, like those provided by Catholic Charities. At its Sullivan County campus, Catholic Charities offers a comprehensive continuum of treatment programming, including detox/crisis care, residential, supportive living, day rehabilitation, outpatient services, a mobile outreach team, and peer services. Unfortunately, when Catholic Charities assumed management of what was a struggling Sullivan County chemical dependency program in 2014, it inherited an aging facility in need of significant repairs and infrastructure upgrades due to many years of deferred maintenance. Making physical infrastructure improvements to this aging campus will make the program more welcoming and appealing and more conducive to client engagement and positive treatment outcomes, which, in turn, will result in increased utilization.

Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health New York City $450,000 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the US has suffered by far the highest volume of deaths of any nation in the world, nearly twice the next highest nation, and under-represented and marginalized communities in the US have borne a highly disproportionate brunt of this health burden. There is a critical need to train and produce a new generation of more diverse public health and epidemiologic experts, emerging from local communities and trained at the highest level, in order to more effectively fight against emerging viruses, like COVID-19, and other health threats, ranging from cancer to opioid overdoses to gun violence. The proposed NextGen Public Health Scholars Program is a 6-year \"2+2+2 pipeline\" education program designed to create this new generation of epidemiology and public health experts from diverse backgrounds and serve as a nationwide model to identify our most highly under-recognized and under-appreciated pool of potential young epidemiologists emerging from the nation's community colleges. Comic Book Legal Defense Fund Carmel $315,000 Since its beginnings in a successful 1986 effort to reverse the conviction of a comic book store employee for selling comics erroneously deemed to be obscene, the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund has offered help to retailers, creators, educators, librarians, students, parents, and fans concerned about the improper exclusion of works of comic art from the public square. As with book challenges more generally, objections to the comic books and graphic novels are ubiquitous, occurring coast-to-coast from California to New York.

Cool Culture Bronx County, Kings County, New York County, Queens County, Richmand County $50,000 \"CityWide is a unique network of barrier-removing programming for families that includes: 450 partner educators whom we work to build cultural equity and participation, distribute Family Passes (to families with pre-K to first-grade children) connecting 50,000 families annually to unlimited free access to 90+ museums and cultural institutions. CityWide is one of the most robust programs of its kind in the country allowing Cool Culture families make over 180,000 museum visits each year across the city. The program also offers Family Festivals that reflect the interests and priorities of BIPOC families and communities; and multilingual resources that support cultural participation and engagement. To broaden our scope and deepen the impact of the CityWide program, we are in the process of creating a Cool Culture Digital Platform/App. With the goals to spread information and access, amplify activist voices and cultivate relationships across our community, the Platform will help to organize, complement, and document in-person creative gatherings and community-building experiences across our network. CityWide runs in conjunction with the Curators for Families program, which brings art to communities - virtually and in-person - including Harlem, Chinatown, and the Lower East Side in Manhattan; Corona and Flushing, Queens; and Bedford Stuyvesant and Crown Heights in Brooklyn - to cultivate storytelling and relationship building between families, educators, museum professionals, and artists through the creation of place-based art and cultural projects.\" Covenant House New York New York Bronx $150,000 CHNY is requesting $150,000 in funding to support continued enhancement of our CovWorks Vocational Training Program, serving young people in all of our residential programs, ages 18-24. Specifically, we plan to build out relationships with community partners offering vocational trainings, and employers offering jobs, in the fields that have emerged as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as ones that have remained steady despite economic disruption. Crouse Health Onondaga $1,009,000 Crouse Health is requesting federal funds to enhance the rapid evaluation unit of the Emergency Department (ED). Crouse Health's facilities team will work with a chosen architect to reconfigure current space and build out into an adjacent area. The Emergency Department benefits the community by serving as a resource for ill and injured patients 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This universal accessibility can make it extremely difficult for patients and medical staff as patients arrive unscheduled at all times. Emergency Departments are increasingly busy across the country, including Onondaga and surrounding counties. The three hospitals located in Syracuse work together to maintain capacity as much as feasible. The increase in usage has a number of contributing factors, including the urgent medical needs of people who have put off medical care for the past two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Cultural Museum of African Art (CMAA) Kings County $2,300,000 CMAA's goal is to create a public-facing museum in the Bedford Stuyvesant community. Bed-Stuy has the largest concentration of African Americans of any neighborhood in the United States. Providing African Americans with access to their complete history, art and culture, going back to the very beginnings of human history, will empower the African American community with knowledge of self. Every group of people needs and deserves to understand their origins. CMAA has the evidence (Artifacts) to tell this story in the most substantive manner. CUNY Dominican Studies Institute at The City Colle New York $809,000 Within the history of the United States, New York has long been synonymous with diversity. Home to the Finger Lakes, whose foliage demonstrates that multiplicity is our inherent nature; the Dominican Juan Rodriguez, a mulatto from Santo Domingo who settled on Manhattan Island among the Lenape people in 1613, becoming New York City's first immigrant; the Ellis Island, where millions of immigrants from the world came through as one; The Stone Wall Inn, where those rejected by society banded together to assert their right to dignity and belonging; and Woodstock, where love bonded people of all backgrounds before the eclectic sounds of rock & roll. These events, among others, repeatedly, show the world that variety and difference are our strengths\u2014and that cultural diversity is one of our fundamental values, which we fiercely safeguard and defend\u2014because these parts are what make us whole. The proposed CUNY CHLI proposes to further this tradition by emphasizing the legacy and cultural diversity that is so inherent to New Yorkers. It will make the abstract\u2014concrete\u2014and equip our teachers with the tools necessary to recognize the diverse cultural historical legacy of their students. Taking such action will pose us to honor difference and to foster greater understanding of our community at large. CUNY on Behalf of Hunter College New York County $792,000 Learning and creative hub serving the Harlem community. Developmental Disabilities Institute Suffolk County $485,000 DDI seeks funding in the amount of $485,000 for the replacement of the roof at our Early Childhood Center located at 1 Scouting Boulevard in Medford. DDI's Early Childhood Learning Center offers a nurturing environment, utilizing the principles of Applied Behavior Analysis to foster growth and development in early learners (ages 0-3) and preschoolers (ages 3-5) diagnosed with autism. We achieve a remarkable 88% placement rate of special education preschoolers into their home school district by kindergarten. This project will replace approximately 13,625 square feet of the roof that has not been replaced since before DDI acquired the building in 1998. The integrity of the roof has been compromised by weather and wear resulting in leaks and damage throughout the building. Leaks due to rain compromise the learning environment of our young children. In these Applied Behavior Analysis classrooms, many DDI students suffer from transitional issues. The difficulty with transitions is not intentional, rather the child struggles with making the cognitive adjustments necessary to their normal routines. As a consequence, transitions for children with autism are often accompanied by stress, anxiety, and frustration. Thus, when classroom areas, entrances and corridors must be blocked off due to leaks, it becomes unsettling and disruptive for our students who require predictability. Further, the Medford site has recently been renovated to add classrooms in order to expand access to learning for children with disabilities. The prevention of water damage is important for DDI to keep these new classrooms refreshed and safe. Dominican Women's Development Center New York $1,000,000 DWDC works with the low-income immigrants residents in the Congressional District 13. According to the 2020 Manhattan's Statement of Community District Needs, WH/I has a population of 190,020 residents with 50%+ being born outside the United States; 63% being Latinos and with Dominicans comprising the largest Latino group (53%) and the largest concentration of Dominicans in the United States. About 40% of WH/I households register a income below the poverty level, 52.5% are female and 80.4% are 18 years old or older. WH/I's unemployment rate is 9.2% and the Latino's population, which is increasing, registers one of the lowest levels of education in the NYC. Dorill Initiative, Inc.

El Museo del Barrio New York $1,000,000 El Museo del Barrio, an East Harlem-based, Latinx arts museum, plans to expand bilingual, arts-based educational programming and develop new initiatives to meet the needs of East Harlem students in a hyper focused way. Funding would allow El Museo to offer subsidized programming for East Harlem schools; partner with schools to craft curricula that specifically address students' needs; employ more multi-disciplined, teaching artists to serve as educators in each partnering school; expand cultural offerings that encourage learning beyond the classroom; and increase internal capacity to continue providing engaging and robust arts education. EmblemHealth, Inc. Queens County $900,000 This program will be piloted in Queens and will target pressing and under resourced mental wellbeing needs, with a focus on home and family life, as well as challenges that are unique to New Yorkers. The education and support from this programming will fill a gap in care, create a path to access mental wellbeing services with reduced stigma, and provide culturally competent care to the diverse populations we serve, including parents, caregivers, children and teens, LGBTQ+ individuals, racial minorities, and essential workers. We know that mental wellbeing needs are critically important, especially in the current climate, and this project would allow Neighborhood Care to connect more people to education, resources, and support, and ultimately help improve the health and lives of New Yorkers.

Fordham University New York County $456,000 Outreach to vulnerable populations. Fordham University New York City $477,000 \"Over 40 weeks in 2022, the Clinical Mental Health Services (CCMH) program is currently on track to provide free culturally appropriate and trauma informed telemental health counseling to a minimum of 80 youth in the Bronx. Youth are offered 10 free individual counseling sessions to address internal, external, and contextual stressors and develop coping skills. Sessions are offered in both Spanish and English. This proposal aims to expand CCMH's operation from 40 to 46 weeks in 2023 to: (a) Offer free counseling sessions to a minimum of 200 youth and their guardians from low income families in NYC, particularly those living in marginalized Black, Latinx, Asian and immigrant communities. CCMH's tele-mental health model enables increased flexibility in scheduling, assisting guardians in accessing mental health services and resources more efficiently for their children and themselves. (b) Increase counseling groups tailored to the needs of the NYC community. In 2022, we have partnered with Sinergia to offer a virtual, bilingual group for boys with autism spectrum disorder to practice social communication skills, foster self-awareness, and self-esteem. This proposal expands our unique group offerings for youth across New York City. (c) Expand free presentations and workshops to guardians/caretakers, teachers, and community organizations working with youth on a range of mental health topics. For over 12 months, CCMH has offered workshops developed with input from these stakeholders to tailor them to their individual needs. This proposal expands these offerings to guardians, schools, and community organizations in all five New York City Boroughs.\" Freeport Union Free School District Nassau County $275,000 The track at the Freeport High School is approximately 10 years old and while it has been well maintained, it is coming to the end of its useful life. This area is widely used not only by our athletic teams and physical education programs, it is an area that is often used by members of the community to exercise. Freeport is a suburban community with limited green space. A resurfaced track will ensure a safe and inviting place for community members, students and staff exercise and participate in athletics. The renovation and upgrade of the track will increase the safety and usability of the track as well as reduce costs to the district in annual upkeep and repairs. The Freeport UFSD is seeking to create a to state-of-the-art track for the district and community members. According to the NYS of Health, obesity rates in NYS and across the nation has reached epidemic proportions. Creating communities that support healthy choices and accessibility to physical activity opportunities increase efforts to reduce and prevent chronic diseases. The percentage of New York State adults who are overweight or obese increased from 42% in 1997 to 63.2% in 2019. The percentage of New York State adults who have obesity increased from 16% in 1997 to 27.1% in 2019. Obesity among children and adolescents has tripled over the past three decades. Currently, a third of New York's children are obese or overweight. Obesity also disproportionately impacts specific racial and ethnic minority groups, including Hispanic and Black non-Hispanic adults who are the majority group in Freeport. They have higher prevalence of obesity and are more likely to experience worse outcomes from COVID-19. Freeport was one of the hardest hit communities on Long Island with COVID. Along with the risks for life-shortening chronic diseases, being overweight contributes to poor mental health associated with low self-esteem and depression. Promoting physical fitness activities (walking, running, jogging) with access to a safe and well-maintained track will help to decrease obesity and promote improved health for students and the community at large. The replacement of the track surface will improve the aesthetics of this widely used area and it will make the track safer to use by students and community members that often use the track. Freeport Union Free School District Nassau County $232,000 Currently, the playground area students are using is separated into three sections including dirt, concrete, and rubber mulch. All three areas are not the most conducive for young children who utilize the space for outdoor learning and playing. Our plan to renovate this space includes one ground covering that incorporates a padded turf playground surface, which meets all critical fall height safety requirements as well as appropriate playground equipment, seating, and interactive learning tools. Having playground space and equipment are very important for the development of early learners. A playground helps young children with balance and teaches them to know where their body is in space. It also gives practice with fine motor skills (gripping the chain), gross motor skills (pumping the legs to swing higher), and coordination (putting it all together). All children need playgrounds to explore and develop and to just be kids, especially those who live in poverty, where the local playground might be the only time they get to play. Over 70% of our Freeport children come from low-income homes. The renovation will not only enhance the aesthetics of the area for the community, but it is needed mostly to address the safety and usability of the space. Additionally, research shows that outdoor learning has a variety of benefits on students' mental health and academic performance. Students are often calmer and better able to focus when they learn in nature (outdoors) and teachers in Freeport have reported better behaviors and social interactions with fewer disciplinary issues when they incorporate outdoor learning/activities into students' school day. Freeport Union Free School District Nassau County $152,000 Freeport High School aims to continuously improve its graduation rates and ensure students have adequate access to educational/career information to make informed decisions when planning their life after high school. The District seeks to increase the rate of college-going Freeport high school graduates and guide students to selecting lucrative careers and/or trades. The creation of a college and career center will promote a college-going mentality as well as offer a place where information and resources are readily available to students and their parents. The Freeport High School College and Career Center will focus on designing, implementing, and managing services, programs and systems that foster college and career readiness. The Center would offer information about career paths and college including college majors, essays, and applications; financial aid; resume writing; college entrance exams and much more. It would house a variety of books, brochures and computer programs with specialized guidance materials, test registration forms and other relevant information and resources. Freeport Union Free School District Nassau County $1,000,000 The Freeport UFSD is seeking to create a to state-of-the-art sports complex for the community to participate in sporting events and large gatherings. According to the NYS of Health, obesity rates in NYS and across the nation has reached epidemic proportions. Creating communities that support healthy choices and accessibility to physical activity opportunities increase efforts to reduce and prevent chronic diseases. The percentage of New York State adults who are overweight or obese increased from 42% in 1997 to 63.2% in 2019. The percentage of New York State adults who have obesity increased from 16% in 1997 to 27.1% in 2019. Obesity among children and adolescents has tripled over the past three decades.

Obesity also disproportionately impacts specific racial and ethnic minority groups, including Hispanic and Black non-Hispanic adults who are the majority group in Freeport. They have higher prevalence of obesity and are more likely to experience worse outcomes from COVID-19. Freeport was one of the hardest hit communities on Long Island with COVID. Along with the risks for life-shortening chronic diseases, being overweight contributes to poor mental health associated with low self-esteem and depression. Promoting athletic programs physical fitness through sports will help decrease numbers of premature death and disability for an increasingly large segment of New Yorkers. The creation of this new sports complex will give students and the community access to a state of the art facility to partake in athletic programming.

Friends Of Harlem Hospital Center New York $1,000,000 75 million Americans will be over the age of 65 by 2030. About 28 percent of older adults in the U.S. (13.8 million people) live alone, according to a report by the Administration on Aging of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Mental and behavioral health is a critical and frequently unaddressed need in racial and ethnic minority communities. Blacks, Latinos, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and Asian Americans are over-represented in populations that are particularly at risk for mental health disorders. Additionally, minority individuals may experience symptoms that are undiagnosed, under-diagnosed, or misdiagnosed for cultural, linguistic, or historical reason Fulton-Montgomery Community College Fulton County $50,000 Fulton-Montgomery Community College (FM), serves an economically challenged area of Upstate New York. As New York has become a leader in supporting new agricultural methods, including federally-approved industrial hemp production, FM's been at the forefront of developing the hydroponic training programs necessary for growing the agricultural workforce. FM has worked collaboratively with local businesses to develop innovative and accessible programs that quickly train and provide certification to students entering the hydroponics field. Currently, FM's specialized hydroponics course takes place at a shared lab facility through Hamilton-Fulton-Montgomery Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (HFM BOCES) since FM lacks its own Hydroponics Lab on campus. FM can only use the HFM BOCES lab in the evening hours, after high schools students have been dismissed. As a result, the number and schedule of course sections offered each semester is limited. This constrains the number of students FM can enroll and train. Constraints on program offerings and student enrollment ultimately stalls FM's ability to scale the hydroponic workforce and meet the demands of expanding businesses in the region. FM is thus requesting funds to equip a Hydroponics Lab on campus. FM has already had great success in recruiting and enrolling these programs, especially across the adult student (25+) population. The addition of an on-campus lab will enable FM to scale the program and grow the workforce in a way that meets local, regional, and state need. It will also serve to attract new businesses and revitalize the struggling economy of FM's service area.

Haitian Americans United for Progress Kings County, New York, Queens County, New York $365,000 HAUP is applying for funding to support youth leadership and youth workforce programming. The youth in HAUP's service area's high need immigrant communities in Brooklyn and Queens are in need of youth development services to provide employment, training, and skills-building opportunities. The communities served by HAUP experience a range of specific needs stemming from a range of social determinants of health and co-occurring risk behaviors, including poverty, low educational achievement, poor quality housing and high rates of homelessness, mental health issues, and substance abuse socioeconomic disparities; related disparities include poor access to health care, poor community health, high rates of uninsured persons, high rates of substance use and alcohol abuse, extensive poverty, and high rates of crime and violence. As a result, the service area contains neighborhoods with some of the poorest and least-educated residents in NYC. For example, the poverty rate in Crown Heights is 26.5% and 40.1% of residents receive public insurance. Youth in the service area face additional unique challenges and barriers. In 2018, Black and Latino youth reported rates of disconnection at roughly two times those of White youth. In 2017, homicide and drug use accounted for nearly a third of deaths combined among young adults aged 15 to 24. While homicide deaths decreased over 13% from 2010 to 2017, drug-related deaths tripled, and death by suicide increased over this time period.

New York City Ballet New York County $100,000 New York City Ballet (NYCB) conducts three distinct multi-workshop residency programs in New York City public schools for 1st - 5th graders: Ballet Tales, Project Ballet, and The Nutcracker Project. NYCB Teaching Artists, in collaboration with classroom teachers, introduce students to NYCB's repertory, engage them with themes in the choreography and music, and focus on dancemaking through collaborative creative writing and movement. In addition, Teaching Artists attend diversity, equity, and inclusion training at the beginning of the school year. This training is well-received by Teaching Artists, and based on this positive feedback, NYCB's education staff has made several changes to the curriculum to encourage students to bring their own creativity, voice, and perspective to the residencies. All residency curricula support federal, state, and city dance education standards. In a typical season, student matinees, two of George Balanchine's The Nutcracker in December and one of mixed repertory in February are a key component of all residency programs, bringing NYCB's choreography and music to life and giving students an experience of attending a performance at the David H. Koch Theater. The final component of the residencies is the culminating performance at the students schools, during which they are able to showcase all they have learned by performing the dances they have created together.

New York Edge, Inc New York City $850,000 Afterschool programming for children throughout New York City. New York Medical College Westchester $1,800,000 Americans everywhere expect schools to provide safe learning environments. Schoolchildren in underserved and low-income communities deserve and need equity in safe learning environments, which in turn requires equity in protection from potential threats to their safety, inside and outside school. Teachers, school leaders, and staff deserve protection as well, but training in disaster and terrorism preparedness and response is often limited to a few schools and mostly in more affluent areas, leaving schools and parents in diverse communities without the needed training to protect their children and neighborhoods. New York Medical College is uniquely suited to fill this gap through its locally and nationally recognized program for disaster preparedness in schools. New York State Network for Youth Success, Inc.

We are requesting $240,795 to promote equitable access to comprehensive afterschool and Community Schools to combat learning loss and increase career readiness through connections to STEAM. With the majority of New York's ARP-ESSER funds directed to LEAs, capacity and technical support are urgently needed. In response to requests from our Community School Network, this will include developing a communications campaign on behalf of Community Schools to promote the efficacy of the community school strategy; allow leadership to leverage the strategy for more collaborative resources and financial support; and increase utilization of school-community partnerships to support student success. As the lead agency for the National Girls Collaborative Project, which works to increase gender equity in STEAM through afterschool, we will hire a STEAM Coordinator to provide technical assistance, quality assurance, and professional development for afterschool programs. This would include strengthening relationships between NYS's STEM Ecosystems, STEM Hubs, and 15 Regional Afterschool Networks to encourage collaboration and share STEAM resources/best practices; establishing new partnerships with STEAM experts and role models; and expanding existing STEAM professional development offerings (Click2SciencePD, for example).\" New York StateWide Senior Action Council, Inc.

The funding will provide a full set of hydroponic equipment and supplies to create a classroom lab, as well as curriculum, comprehensive training and weekly support for one year. The 20,000 students we will reach, many of whom were already among NYC's most vulnerable, experienced some of the most harmful social and economic impacts of the pandemic, including the trauma of family illness, increased food and housing insecurity, and more extensive learning loss than their peers in more affluent communities. Our program responds to students' needs by providing inquiry-based science and sustainability education that's aligned to NYC and NYS science standards and tailored to how students learn best: through hands-on, active learning. As they grow food from seed to harvest, students study core science disciplines, water conservation, climate change, and gain essential skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration, building a foundation for future pathways in STEM and sustainability careers and closing the race-based gaps in access to STEM education. In addition, the experience of growing food and nurturing plants in the classroom supports students' social-emotional well-being, a crucial benefit after the losses students have faced on so many fronts over the past two years. \" New York Theological Seminary New York $660,000 As an institution focused on non-traditional high-quality theological education, New York Theological Seminary's mission is to prepare faith and thought leaders to engage in relevant, restorative, and revolutionary ministry.

New York University College of Dentistry Brooklyn $500,000 There are approximately 22 million veterans in the U.S. today, of whom 9 million are enrolled in the VA Health System. However, only 1.2 million veterans are eligible to receive dental benefits through the VA. The VA provides limited dental services, for which veterans must meet strict criteria for outpatient dental care to be covered under the VA Benefits Package. As a result, many veterans without dental insurance simply abandon the search for care, leading to dental neglect and worsening conditions that too frequently leave the veteran with no recourse other than to seek costly emergency care. The requested funding will be used to provide preventive education and comprehensive dental care to thousands of Veterans in the New York City area who are not eligible to receive those services through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

The Festival introduces and distributes educational resources and knowledge by promoting global literature to the many cultural and linguistic communities, including tourists, that make up New York. Per Scholas New York $1,200,000 With the support of Congressionally Directed Spending, Per Scholas will create accessible pathways to high growth careers in Cybersecurity. Funds will enable Per Scholas to train 210 New Yorkers who would otherwise be excluded from tech careers - people of color, women, those without college degrees, or those from households with limited means - double what Per Scholas could achieve without this investment. With CDS support, we will launch two new initiatives to increase accessibility to communities of color: \"Bridge to Cyber\" training and Cyber Satellite. This project will facilitate the launch of at least 150 careers in cybersecurity each year and infuse $6.2M in new earnings into struggling New York neighborhoods. PLAY Sports Coalition New York $250,000 The PLAY Sports Coalition is a nonprofit organization that represents nearly 4,000 youth sports leaders across the country. We would like to expand our training and professional development offerings for youth sports nonprofit leaders, particularly those serving youth in and around New York City and underserved communities. The members of our coalition face a variety of challenges that can be addressed through on- and off-field training and development, sharing of best practices related to youth health and safety, and youth development principles. Providing capacity to youth sports leaders allows them to better serve the families in their communities, leading to better physical, emotional, and mental health outcomes, better educational outcomes, and fewer interactions with the criminal justice system. PLAYS leadership team is composed entirely of volunteers, as is its board of directors. We have expertise, access to a network of leaders and experts in the field, and a strong coalition of members that provide opportunities for youth to play sports. However we have limited resources to deliver programs to build the capacity of these organizations in order to increase participation. Premium Health, Inc. Kings County $2,083,000 This project will thus improve access to and quality of care across the continuum of mental health promotion for the underserved populations Rebecca's Little Survivors Foundation Inc Richmond $1,000,000 Rebecca's Resilience Project also known as RRP will develop and implement an advanced technological system to expand programming that address social emotional learning, crime prevention, mental health tangible coping tools, financial tech literacy, environmental awareness and justice and education as well as our new maternal health inequities program in communities of color throughout Brooklyn, Staten Island, Queens, Manhattan and the Bronx.

Refuah Health Center, Inc. Sullivan County $2,000,000 \"This project involves the construction of a permanent, state-of-the art outpatient health care facility in South Fallsburg to help address the significant and dire healthcare needs faced by Sullivan County. The facility will expand and enhance RefuahHealth's ability to provide high-quality, integrated, and affordable care to the residents of Sullivan County. Access to high-quality, affordable healthcare is a critical need in Sullivan County. The county currently ranks 60 out of 62 for health outcomes in New York. Sullivan County has the highest rate of premature deaths in the state - contributors to high mortality include accidents, drug overdose and largely preventable chronic disease, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. The construction of an expanded, permanent, state-of-the-art health care facility in South Fallsburg will address a critical access issue and improve health and wellness for the entire county. \" Research Foundation of CUNY on behalf of LaGuardia Queens County $405,000 \"LaGuardia Community College's Plumbing 1, Electrical 1 and HVAC 1 Training Programs connect people living in poverty in our region with skilled employment opportunities through skills-building training that will prepare students for in-demand occupations. There is a need for talent pipelines into the industry to maintain our residential, commercial and physical infrastructure needs for the region's prosperity for decades to come. LaGuardia has a successful track record of providing training in electrical, plumbing and HVAC. However, the college does not currently have the internal capabilities to deliver these skill trainings on-site and to scale. Programs are currently offered at off-site locations which make it extremely difficult to provide expanded training to meet local community and employer demand. This also creates limited scheduling options which are not supportive of the daytime or weekend training schedules which are critical for many of the constituents we serve who are under-employed incumbent workers. Establishing a Workforce Development Training Center on campus would give us the needed flexibility to begin offering more classes and serve more students.\" Richmond University Medical Center Richmond County $3,000,000 \"Richmond University Medical Center delivers 3,000 newborns annually. Approximately 600 are admitted annually to our highly acclaimed Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The unit is one of the best in NYC and the Northeast; our NICU survival rate is of 997.2 out of every 1,000 births as verified by the Vermont Oxford benchmark tool. Richmond University Medical Center's NICU accommodates 25 infants; however, the footprint is very small-3,600 SF. The NICU renovation will bring it up to current ADA and FGI space requirements at 7,950 sq. feet. We will maximize the quantity of private rooms and will incorporate bays/cubicles as required to meet 25 infant stations, affording more privacy and comfort for families. Other areas that will be expanded include infant nutrition areas, parent handwashing areas, lactation support rooms, soiled, clean, equipment and med rooms, and staff support areas including lounge, lockers, and toilet areas. We will also expand the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) to accommodate current space requirements for 3 cribs. This will require bringing the PICU unit to 2018 FGI code to provide the current square footage requirements for the redesigned PICU from 190 a SF PICU footprint to 900 sq. ft. unit.\" RISE Housing and Support Services, Inc. Saratoga County $2,359,000 \"Federal funding will be used to support pre-development and construction of a second story addition, as well as the reconfiguration of the first floor of RISE's existing main office building. This 5,200 square foot expansion and first floor reconfiguration are vital for optimizing the existing space and facilitating the proposed HOMEBASE program. The first floor will be gutted and office space reconfigured to accommodate the growing level of staffing required to adequately serve the vulnerable populations in Saratoga Springs and the surrounding communities. A second-floor addition will be constructed to move administrative staff out of program areas, prioritizing first-floor space for direct-care staff to facilitate in person service provision. When complete, HOMEBASE will include: Cafe;/Kitchen: A space to serve and enjoy a meal, and to be additionally used for life skills workshops/pre-vocational classes. Computer Room: Vital for teaching computer skills, explaining cyber safety, online learning, and job searches. Will be used for workshops as well as free internet access. Workshops: Dedicated spaces for skills classes, including money management (banking basics, budgeting and saving, on-line banking, financial services), home management (grocery shopping, sewing, cleaning, hygiene), community awareness (social interactions, local resources). Living Room: A large open central area for participants to interact, relax, and enjoy a safe space. There will be games, books, a television, a pool table, and a foosball table. Studio: 2,000 sq/ft art studio. We will also partner with local art therapists to provide art therapy groups to participants as well as members of the wider community.\" Rochester Technology and Manufacturing Association Monroe $250,000 The Finger Lakes Youth Apprenticeship Program (FLYAP) matches students to local advanced manufacturing businesses in an effort to bridge the gap between youth and the industry. There are currently hundreds of companies in the greater Rochester and Finger Lakes region looking for skilled workers. FLYAP introduces local students to these careers and prepares them for the modern-day workforce through job shadows and paid co-ops. These careers and Apprenticeships offer competitive pay, a pathway out of poverty and career advancement opportunities. The Finger Lakes Youth Apprenticeship Program is a one-of-a-kind career exploration program that is becoming the model for other regions across the state. Rome Memorial Hospital, Inc., d/b/a Rome Health Oneida $1,650,000 Rome Memorial Hospital, Inc., d/b/a Rome Health seeks funding to purchase a high speed 64-slice CT Scanner to support rapid diagnosis and treatment of stroke.

Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center Erie County $2,100,000 Roswell Park will use funds to pay for 50% of the equipment cost to purchase a new Adaptive Radiation Therapy LINAC. SCO Family Services Queens 190 SCO's belief in leveling the playing field for young people ages 16-26 (TAY) requires a model that recognizes the importance of acknowledging the complex trauma that many of them have experienced and working with them first to meet basic needs of food, shelter, housing, economic stability, physical and mental health before setting aspirational goals. Targeting the most pressing Social Determinants of Health helps reduce the inequities that young people experience. The small wins achieved by addressing critical needs first ensure people feel seen, heard, and valued based upon what they need versus what the program needs, building trust and momentum to think beyond the crisis and toward the future. SCO Family Services Glen Cove $241,000 According to data provided by the Bureau of Early Intervention at the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Black children are less likely to be referred to EI than children of other races. Moreover, once referred to EI, Black and Latinx children are less likely to make it through the enrollment process. These two trends are particularly acute in Brownsville and surrounding neighborhoods in NY-09. In 2018, nearly 54 out of every 1,000 white children in NYC received EI services. Only 32 out of every 1,000 Black children in Brownsville received EI. The disparities in EI enrollment persist to this day. Inequitable access to CPSE is perhaps even greater for Brownsville than the inequities in the EI system, while the citywide trends by race demonstrate barriers to access for Black and Latinx children, who comprise the majority of children in Brownsville. NYC Department of Education (DOE) District 23, which encompasses Brownsville/Ocean Hill, is unique among the DOE's 32 Districts in its lack of access to CPSE services, demonstrating deep, systemic flaws in CPSE processes. According to a 2021 report on CPSE during the 2019-20 school year released by the DOE to NY City Council, District 23 ranked 31st or 32nd in its CPSE referral rate, its percentage of referrals deemed eligible, its percentage of referrals that hosted an IEP meeting, and its percentage of referrals deemed eligible for services who had attained those services by the end of the school year SEPA Mujer, Inc. Suffolk County $228,000 SEPA Mujer is requesting funds to support and expand the three GIRLS A.C.T. programs: 1) Summer Intensive Youth Leadership Academy in collaboration with the Suffolk County Department of Labor; 2) Latina Youth Leadership School Council to begin in the Patchogue-Medford High School; 3) Youth Leadership Chapter Meetings open to young Latina students from school districts located in our 4 chapters in Suffolk County. GIRLS A.C.T. utilizes SEPA's own curriculum that focuses on 1) Leadership Development/Community Engagement; 2) Workforce Development; 3) Wellness Education; 4) Academic Success. GIRLS A.C.T. helps guide young Latina women to become future leaders in their schools and local communities, empowers them to be voices for change and equality and provides them with the skills needed to be successful in the workforce and create stability in their personal lives. The overall goal of the GIRLS A.C.T. program is to provide protective factors and knowledge that equip young Latina women to be proactively engaged in planning for stable futures and community engagement. Funds for GIRLS A.C.T. will be used to increase internal capacity for project staffing, in addition to transportation, college tours, workforce training, and administrative expenses. Siena College Albany County $497,000 Educational equipment for nursing labs.

St. Ann's Warehouse Kings County $250,000 St. Ann's Warehouse, a four decade old cultural organization located in Brooklyn Bridge Park is applying for funding to support two distinct sets of educational activities to engage young people: the relaunch of St. Ann's popular Youth Empowerment program and an education initiative in conjunction with a deeply moving public art project Little Amal: The Promise of America, which promotes hope and tolerance for displaced people. Working with the NYC Department of Education we will develop arts education programming to reach hundreds of New York City public school students and youth from local community centers with multidisciplinary workshops, performances, and special events. With Little Amal, there will be actions and activities throughout the five boroughs that entail visual art making and performance activities. Main theme of the educational programming will be the current global immigrant and refugee crisis and the plight of displaced people throughout the world. It is the theme of Little Amal and the main theatrical event of the season The Jungle, a play about a refugee camp in Northern France that St. Ann's will present for six weeks in the winter of 2023. St. Barnabas Hospital (dba SBH Health System) Bronx $7,000,000 \"St. Barnabas Hospital, a safety net institution located in the Bronx, NY, respectfully requests consideration of $7,000,000 in community project funding that will allow us to purchase much needed medical equipment, including x-ray machines, microscopes, anesthesia machines, ultrasounds, and specialty equipment to support dental, colorectal, podiatry fields. As an independent hospital in a poor urban community, our resources are limited; all of the equipment to be purchased through this project is more than 10 years old with lifespans exceeded. St. Francis College Kings County $830,000 St. Francis College (SFC) will utilize congressionally directed spending to upgrade technology in our nursing simulation lab, which is used by both SFC's nursing students as well as community partners in healthcare and K-12 education. Aligned with the goals of the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE), the simulation lab improves the quality of SFC's nursing education program and prepares future nurses to offer exceptional, compassionate care across NYC. St. John Fisher College Monroe County $1,200,000 Few schools have needed resources to blend students' love of athletics with success in school. The first issue is motivation. As noted by Muhammad, Students didn't know their why; Why come to school? Why do things to succeed? Athletics gives them a why. Within Rochester, 30% of residents live at or below the poverty line, which is double the state average. As a mirror of this poverty, almost all students in the Rochester City School District are financially disadvantaged (89%) and many will be the first in their family to attend a 4-year college. However, 50% of the high schools in the district are in receivership. While the overall high school graduation rate hit a high of 71% in 2021, only 56% of students earned a Regents diploma. According to the Principal of Monroe High School, Jason Muhammad, athletics may serve as a key motivator to improve these statistics. As he observes, Data from the Rochester City School District reflects the national trend: the more sports students play the higher the Attendance Rate, the higher the Graduation Rate, the higher the overall Grade Point Averages, and the lower the Suspension Rate. By partnering with St. John Fisher College, students will gain experience in the expanding field of biomechanics through the development of the Laboratory for the Enhancement of Athletic Performance (LEAP lab). St. John's Riverside Hospital Westchester $4,000,000 \"St. John's Riverside Hospital (SJRH) seeks $4 million in Congressionally Directed Spending consisting of two components: a) $3 million to be used for capital improvements and Emergency Department expansion, reducing current severe overcrowding and providing a separate, more private, less stressful, quieter and more welcoming space for ED patients with less acute conditions; and b) $1 million to be spent on community-driven ED staff training to improve the quality of care received by the 70% of our ED patients who are people of color, reduce implicit bias, promote health equity, and help link ED patients to services addressing social determinants of health and increasing access to appropriate sources of primary care. Note: As much as 80% of a person';s health is determined by the social and economic conditions of their homes and communities. Establishing interventions for high-risk populations, like the ones we serve, starts with identifying the most critical needs and then leverages demographic and economic data to address these social determinants and effectively treat the whole person. This grant will build a foundation, allowing SJRH to move into more effective treatments for the whole person within our community. \" St. Joseph's College New York Kings County $879,000 The Cybersecurity and Science Technology Initiative at SJC Brooklyn will address an urgent need for digital fluency and security among our future workforce and in our community - including seniors and immigrants. St. Joseph's Health Onondaga County $1,500,000 St. Joseph's seeks to double the number (from 300 per year to 600 per year) of enrollments at one of the largest hospital based nursing colleges in the United States. Even prior to COVID, NYS and the country faced a growing crisis in terms of our nursing and allied health professionals workforce pipeline. The situation was only exacerbated by the hundreds of thousands of retirements and exits from the healthcare workforce brought on by the stress of the pandemic. The requested $1.5M in funding would complete phase one of the College of Nursing expansion project, including the procurement of local engineering and other necessary approvals and permit applications, architectural and construction contracts and support, project management support and phase one site development. Subsequent funding is tentatively committed pending fulfillment of phase one. This funding would move the project forward which has been stalled as result of financial constraints incurred by the pandemic. St. Joseph's Health Onondaga $252,000 There is a high demand for cardiac sonographers in the Central New York region and a lack of the resources to provide this specialized service for patients. Health care facilities regionally struggle with the ability to attract, hire and retain cardiac sonographers from the distant areas that offer the specific training required. Many of the highly sought cardiac services in our organization and surrounding organizations that attract patients and physicians to the area, heavily rely on the services provided by the limited resource of cardiac sonographers. The result of this is cardiac sonographers are often overworked, the recruitment is highly competitive, scheduling of surgical procedures is delayed and patients sustain long wait periods for echocardiograms. As the cardiac service line continues to flourish, the burden of this deficiency becomes more evident. St. Joseph's Neighborhood Center Monroe County $602,000 This Community Project Funding request will assist St. Joseph's Neighborhood Center to make necessary infrastructure and technology improvements, supporting patient-centered healthcare. State University of New York at Stony Brook Stony Brook $5,000,000 Funds will be used for capital improvement, facilities, and equipment for the Innovation Gateway - a regional hub serving Long Island innovators to expand technology growth and workforce development. Sunset Park Community Safety Initiative Brooklyn $250,000 Sunset Park Community Safety Initiative aims to decrease the occurrence and effects of violence and anti-Asian bias in Sunset Park through self-defense and bystander intervention trainings; community awareness and solidarity-building campaigns; SafeWalks patrolling; and safety accompaniment. In 2021, anti-Asian hate crimes in NYC increased by 343%\u2014and Sunset Park is the NYC neighborhood with the highest rate of reported anti-Asian hate crimes. After the April 12, 2022 subway attack, public safety has become a growing concern among even more residents. Although the city has increased police presence, long-term neighborhood safety will come from visibly building solidarity and providing concrete tools to help the most vulnerable in our neighborhood protect themselves and each other.

SUNY Upstate Medical University Syracuse $898,000 A growing number or Lyme and other tick-borne diseases are increasingly endemic in the US, particularly in places like upstate New York, yet many cases go long-undiagnosed and under treated due to a lack of health care infrastructure specifically devoted to these illnesses. Under one roof, the SUNY Upstate Multidisciplinary Lime and Tick-Borne Disease Treatment Center will combine the research, diagnostic expertise, clinical specialists, and medical education resources that sufferers of these insidious diseases need, when they need it most. Syracuse University Onondaga $5,000,000 Syracuse University is requesting $5 million the Quantum Technology Center to enable New York State and Central New York to become an epicenter of research, training, and advanced manufacturing of quantum technology.

We want to use the Art Cart to partner with local schools and libraries to connect with children and community members to offer integrated art classes with artists from our art program supporting people with disabilities. The Center for Discovery, Inc. Sullivan County $925,000 TCFD has already secured a combination of public and private capital funding to transform the former Frontier Insurance Building in Rock Hill, NY into the statewide Children's Specialty Hospital. The Center now seeks funding to procure the furniture package and complete this urgently needed facility. Furnishing the Children's Specialty Hospital will be a good use of taxpayer funds because it will expedite the opening of this critical resource, advance the treatment of children with complex disabilities, and improve the continuum of care for families in need across New York State.

The Crenulated Company Ltd dba New Settlement Bronx County $320,000 Expansion of health and wellness services to seniors in the South Bronx. The Floating Hospital, Inc. Queens County $1,041,000 NYC has one of the largest homeless family populations in the US. Homeless families and those living in public housing are significantly less likely to complete a referral from a primary care medical provider. Lack of transportation, lack of childcare, lack of disposable funds, lack of education and a general lack of understanding of the need for specialty care renders traditional specialty referrals largely unhelpful. Studies have shown that increasing chronic condition screening through on-site specialties reduces acute care later on. The HOPE Program Bronx County $850,000 Job training and skill development for low-income jobseekers. The Institute of Family Health New York $412,000 The Institute for Family Health, one of the largest federally qualified community health center (FQHC) networks in New York State (NYS), is seeking funds to enhance our efforts to prevent opioid overdose deaths in underserved communities in New York City (NYC). The need to prevent opioid overdose deaths in NYC cannot be overstated. According to the NYC DOHMH Unintentional Drug Poisoning (Overdose) Deaths in NYC in 2020 Epi Data Brief, there were 2,062 overdose deaths in NYC in 2020, and the rate of overdose death increased from 21.9 in 2019 to 30.5 per 100,000 NYC residents in 2020. Fentanyl was present in 77% of overdose deaths in 2020; the most common substance involved in overdose deaths for the fourth consecutive year. Further, according to a new NYC DOHMH report released in April 2022, there were 1,233 confirmed overdose deaths in NYC during the first two quarters of 2021, compared with 965 overdose deaths within the same period in 2020. The report states that more New Yorkers die from overdose than homicides, suicides and motor vehicle crashes combined, and that Bronx and Harlem neighborhoods have the highest rates of overdose death in NYC. Additionally, according to the NYS Department of Health (NYSDOH) 2021 Opioid Annual Data Report, 2,939 overdose deaths involving any opioid occurred among NYS residents in 2019, and there has been an overall increase of 200.2 percent in the number of overdose deaths involving any opioid from 2010 to 2017. The Jamaica Hospital d/b/a Jamaica Hospital Medica Queens County $1,905,000 The requested funds will be used to purchase and install critically needed surgical robotics system, including the da Vinci Xi Single Console System, da Vinci Sim Now Simulator, E-100 generator and da Vinci Xi Integrated Table Motion (da Vinic System Upgrades). These advanced surgery systems will enable our hospital to successfully perform more complex surgeries for patients whose health has decreased significantly due to the inequalities they face in healthcare, advancing health equity in our community. The Jamaica Hospital d/b/a Jamaica Hospital Medica Queens County $2,400,000 Jamaica Hospital operates the busiest Level 1 Trauma Center in New York City, the closest acute care hospital and Level 1 Trauma Center to JFK, and operates a critical Stroke Center and STEMI Program. In addition, as a financially distressed safety net hospital, Jamaica Hospital serves a high volume of low-income individuals covered by Medicaid. Taken together, the hospital receives a treats a high volume of complex surgical cases. Due the hospital's financial distress, related to the inadequate reimbursement received for the medical services provided, it does not otherwise have access to funding for this essential surgical equipment that will benefit patients by providing access to high-quality surgical equipment that is better equipped to handle complex surgical cases. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the significant health and economic inequities, and deeply rooted institutional disinvestments, that have persisted across the communities of color and low-income neighborhoods of New York, including the communities served by Jamaica Hospital. These communities experience higher rates of poverty, higher chances of being uninsured, and poorer health outcomes, and were disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in higher COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths. In light of this recent and historic experience, it is essential to support safety net hospitals, like Jamaica Hospital, in order to ensure its patients have access to state-of-the-art surgical equipment and access to equitable healthcare in New York. The Jewish Board of Family & Children's Services Bronx County $225,000 Secure housing for individuals with behavioral health conditions. The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community New York $350,000 The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center (The Center) requests $350,000 to support Center Works, an LGBTQ-specific economic empowerment program that pairs case management with career services and support.

The Manufacturers Association of Central New York Onondaga $733,000 IDEAS for High Tech Growth will provide training and guaranteed employment for the marginally employed, unemployed and workers who were displaced by the pandemic in entry level Manufacturing Technician positions and entry level Software Development positions. These high-skilled, high- paying career pathways provide equitable access to all New York State residents regardless of their prior education or experience. This comprehensive approach will match the demand for a highly skilled workforce in support of strategic and emerging technologies in New York State, such as semiconductor manufacturing, clean energy, information technology and the associated regional supply chains to these industries. The Mount Sinai Hospital New York County $2,000,000 Set to be completed in 2024, the new ED will have the capacity for 122,000 patients annually, as well as modernizations to enhance operations, improve patient experience in a person-centered way, and increase the community's capacity to receive care for serious and life- threatening illness and injury. The clinical treatment space will be expanded by 8,500 feet, doubling the current amount of space for critically ill adult and pediatric patients. The new emergency department will incorporate best practices currently in place, ensuring effective patient management and flow as well as increased readiness to care for patients with high consequence infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. The Neighborhood Campaign Monroe County $750,000 Funds will be used to support the Community Planning Committee, consisting of misrepresented voices from the neighborhood. The Neighborhood Campaign is led by a Community Planning Committee with two (2) Co-Chairs, working with City of Rochester Mayor Malik Evans and Monroe County Executive Adam Bello to create a neighborhood data collection hub that pays neighborhood consultants to collect assets, needs and priority strategies across the social determinants of health. The planning committee has decided to establish ownership over the data that is being collected, through the development of a Community Internal Review Board (IRB). This Community IRB would be chaired by one of our Co-chairs and would contain representation from Planning Committee members, neighborhood consultants, City and County representatives, and other key data collection representatives in the region. Data would be made available to those organizations and community members looking to collaborate with neighborhoods to apply for grants, create advocacy agendas, and design effective strategies to elevate those most affected by the social determinants of health.

Our expertise accessing our community lies in our years of experience in the identification and understanding of the immigrant experience and the barriers that come along with such an experience. Our staff and Board are representative of the target population as most are from the community and have experienced similar journeys as our clients. We propose the development of a center of excellence in mental health because there is currently, nor has there ever been, a center focusing on addressing Latinx mental health care in the area of Western Queens where over 60% of its residents are Latino/Hispanic. Through our years of personal and professional experience, we know the current medical model does not serve our community because insurance is not always obtainable. Our center will ensure everyone, regardless of insurance or immigrations status, will be seen. We propose a comprehensive program that includes a culturally competent outreach team, a team of patient navigators, and a team of mental health providers. COVID has unfortunately exacerbated the need for mental health. Our program will assess for other needs, providing holistic care and connection. Watertown Urban Mission, Inc.
