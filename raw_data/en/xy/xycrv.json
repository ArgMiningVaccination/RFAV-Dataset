Dr. Robert Carlson developed the topical spray with natural ingredients, including L-arginine, to assist his male patients who deal with early or premature ejaculation. Endure's all-natural ingredients allow the lidocaine to quickly penetrate the barrier layer of the penis and reduce the sensitivity of the nerves directly beneath the skin. The desensitizing effect decreases ejaculation reflex, resulting in more satisfied sex and climax. Endure is FDA approved and compliant with guidelines established by the FDA for an over-the-counter medication. In creating the effective formula, Dr. Carlson focused on improving the quality of most frequently used therapies for PE which were comprised of oily ingredients that possess a foul odor. The research led to the creation of Endure, a powerful, colorless, odorless, tasteless and discrete product that rapidly desensitizes the male organ to overcome PE. \"In my 30 years of practicing medicine, I have evaluated and managed a variety of sexual issues. One of the most common problems I've seen is premature or early ejaculation (PE), a condition that challenges men in any age group. Interestingly, while it is one of the most frequently seen, it remains one of the least talked about problems and can be very disruptive to a relationship,\" said Dr. Carlson. Before Endure, Dr. Carlson spent over 15 years as a devoted and highly skilled heart surgeon, completing board certifications in thoracic surgery, general surgery and participating in many national and international clinical research trials. Over the past 10 years, Dr. Carlson has focused on age management medicine, optimizing heart health and hormonal balance in both men and women. His work has been citied in many of Suzanne Somers writings including, Knock-out, Ageless: The Naked Truth About Bio-identical Hormones and Breakthroughs: Eight Steps to Wellness. Dr. Carlson has also published his own book, The Siesta Beach HCG Lifestyle. Website: [www.endurese.com](http://www.endurese.com/) To view the original version on PR Newswire, "}
