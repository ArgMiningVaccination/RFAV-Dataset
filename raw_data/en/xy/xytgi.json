The program continues to be well-received by Washington State health care providers as a primary source for evidence-based information in support of patient care. As the only evidence-based, statewide health information portal in the country, this unique and forward-thinking program continues to attract attention and interest from health care provider groups within Washington State and from other states. Overview 2012-2013 Annual Report 3 Participation As of November 20, 2013, more than 20,000 licensed healthcare providers in Washington are registered HEALWA users. This represents almost 14% (20,632) of total eligible users (see: Number of Eligible and Registered Licensees, page 5). The fact that HEALWA resources are available to eligible licensed health care providers at any time, from any computer that has internet access, and the availability through HEALWA of accredited Continuing Education modules for Registered Nurses, continue to be incentives to encourage eligible licensed health care providers to activate their access. New for 2012-2013 A bill adding six new professions to HEALWA eligibility was passed during the 2013 Legislative Session and was signed into law by Governor Jay Inslee on May 15, 2013. The new professions that are eligible, starting January 1, 2014, include: Occupational Therapists, Occupational Therapy Assistants, Dietitians, Nutritionists, and Speech-Language Pathologists. Licensed Practical Nurses, also included in the legislation, were added on February 1, 2014. To serve the information needs of these health care providers, the program added several resources targeted toward their practice, including Rehabilitation Reference Center and Primal Pictures Speech Language Pathology. We also added several hundred new full-text journals through the expansion of the MEDLINE and CINAHL databases. Access Access to HEALWA resources is available at healwa.org. Bill signing ceremony by Gov. Inslee for ESB 5206 Olympia, WA May 15, 2013 ESB 5206 makes HEALWA available to Occupational Therapists, Occupational Therapy Assistants, Dietitians, Nutritionists, Speech-Language Pathologists, and Licensed Practical Nurses throughout the State of Washington.
