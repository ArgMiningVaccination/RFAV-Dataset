Alberta has 510,000, or just under 13 per cent of all the mothers in the country. In 2011, there were 377,636 registered newborns in Canada. In 2009, there were 2,100 international adoptions in Canada, with China remaining the primary source. 537,000 was the number of people in Canada who adopted in 2011.

Source: Statistics Canada kIllEr Bunn IEsMother's Day, like many of our modern-day holidays, has roots in Roman and Greek history as well as Christianity. More recently, the day celebrating everything maternal started in the 1600s in England, but was called something a little different: Mothering Sunday. It was celebrated every year on the fourth Sunday of Lent (the 40 day period leading up to Easter) to honour mothers. Children brought gifts, sweets and flowers to pay tribute to the Virgin Mary and their own mothers. There are many early recordings of other countries, like the former Yugoslavia and Italy, having similar celebrations. \"Mothering Sunday\" died out almost completely by the 19th century, probably much to the chagrin of the mothers. After World War II; however, American servicemen brought the custom back, and big businesses promptly jumped on the opportunity to commercialize the event. But hey, moms are great so bring on the chocolate, cards and flowers. Killer Bunnies is an awesome little card game that is best played with three or more players. The game gets extremely hectic really quickly while adults to children alike scramble for the 'Magic Carrot' while trying to keep their army of bunnies alive from the opposing players. Killing each other's bunnies, either by flamethrowers, whisks and nuclear warheads, starvation and other hilariously random weapons, makes for an interesting dynamic between players. The game, although confusing at the beginning, has the same effect Monopoly has on families and groups of friends; the game could end in table flipping and that special, bitter rivalry that lasts for decades. Arguably, the best part of the game is it doesn't matter how many of your opponents bunnies you kill, or how many of yours are killed; the winner is picked at random, depending on who has collected the right carrot. * No actual bunnies were harmed in the making of this reviewKiller Bunnies sells for $30 at most retailers.

This is how pho should be moving forward, modern decor, inexpensive price-tag, guaranteed freshness and fast service. Not the greatest place we've been to despite the high ratings the restaurant has received. We feel it adequately meets the needs for a bowl of pho but by no means is it a game changer. The service was extremely quick and very friendly and the place most definitely lives up to its \"express\" moniker. So if you need something cheap and quick, then look no further.Pho Van is really a great spot if you're looking for something quick and fresh. The biggest issue the restaurant has is if you're a big time phonatic, the \"large\" option won't fill you up unless you grab a side of salad rolls. We feel that if an XL option was implemented where we could get more of those tasty noodles and a more generous serving of meat was given out, Pho Van would be on the path of enlightenment towards achieving zen through pho.\"What do you a PPrEcIatE mo S t a B out your moth E r?\" Rare Beef (Pho Dac Biet) - $8.25.

While the mayor and many others argue that legalizing secondary suites across the city will open up an incredibly tight rental market, others argue they don't fit in their neighbourhood and say they don't want renters. Although surveys have shown that the majority of Calgarians support legalizing secondary suites, the mayor still hasn't been able to get the majority vote in council over the last four years. The Calgary Journal spent three months investigating all aspects of secondary suites in Calgary. We explain what secondary suites are, what the laws and processes are around them, where you can find them and who lives there.

That means the public may never find out for themselves whether the city could have done a better job of responding to that disaster. But, as the Calgary Emergency Management Agency prepares to release it's delayed annual report, some citizens feel the decision to withhold that detailed information is justified. The agency is responsible for Calgary's municipal emergency plan, which spells out the policies and operations the city is supposed to use to prepare for and respond to a disaster. But portions of that plan - which was first issued in September 2010 - are being kept from the public, including its \"flood emergency reference manual. \" In an email, Sheila Johnstone, a media relations representative with the City of Calgary, stated that's because \"those records contain confidential information about facilities and response plans that could be used against The City (such as in a terrorist attack). \" Some Calgarians affected by the flood agree with that position.\"My first reaction was yes, but then again, there are probably a good number of targets of opportunity in that plan, \" wrote Tony Wimmers, a member of the East Sunnyside Survivors Facebook group, in a post on Nov. 15, 2013. \"I wouldn't want just anybody with an Internet connection to learn about it. \" Canadian Taxpayers Federation Alberta director Derek Fildebrandt takes the same view. \"The intention of keeping some of these things a secret is in the case of things like a terrorist attack, we're not giving them plans on how we are going to react. I think that's very smart, \" he says. Because of similar security considerations, the city also isn't releasing information about the results of a large-scale flood exercise that happened in May 2012 - just a year before the disaster. The exercise, known as COMM Bow, involved Emergency Operations Centre and the Recovery Operations Centre personnel simulating a flood that would cause a great magnitude of damage and have a significant long-term impact on Calgarians. The Calgary Emergency Management Agency's upcoming annual report is expected to address the costs and recovery efforts from the real world flood that happened last June. In an email dated Feb. 27, 2014, city media relations representative Johnstone says that report would usually come out in the spring of a given year, but has been delayed until June. \"Once the report is presented to city council, it will be posted online, \" Johnstone wrote. Previous CEMA reports in the past have focused on the cost and recovery efforts of the Husky Tower windstorm, the Shaw Court explosion and the Crowchild Trail water main break to name a few. CEMA's business plan for 2012 also noted the city had budgeted to spend $3,251,000 between 2012 and 2014 to develop a new municipal emergency plan. calgaryjournal.ca MAY 2014 6ciTy calgar y keeps emergency plan a secret There is $3.2 million for Calgary's emergency management plan, but we're not allowed to know how some of the money is spent Paulina liwski pliwsk i@cjournal.ca In June 2013, the city of Calgary was devastated by a historic flood that impacted 110,000 Calgarians who were evacuated from 26 communities.

But a representative from the College - which regulates doctors in the provinces - says the CPSA does not know that accessibility will be compromised. The CPSA's new rules, which were approved by the college's board of governors on March 7, 2014, would allow physicians to refuse to treat a patient with marijuana if they have a moral or religious objection to the drug's use. These rules would also require physicians wishing to prescribe medical marijuana to register with the College as an authorizer of marijuana for medical purposes. This decision came just before the federal government put in place its new Marijuana for Medical Purposes Regulations program. On April 1 Under these new federal regulations, physicians can no longer authorize patients to grow their own marijuana. Instead, physicians can authorize patients to purchase marijuana from a licensed producer. In a memo posted on its website, the College raises concerns over the federal government's new system, stating, \"Health Canada regulations should not ask physicians to provide patient access to a substance with limited evidence of clinical efficacy or safety. \" Wright, the assistant registrar with the College, says Health Canada's new regulations put physicians in the position of administering a treatment that not only lacks conclusive scientific proof and has the potential for misuse, but may produce side effects.\"What (the College) wanted to do is provide a framework that would allow physicians to consider the use of marijuana in appropriate patients, \" says Wright in a phone interview. According to Wright, the names of physicians registered with the College to provide medical marijuana will not be publicly available. The College will track physicians' authorizations to use that drug in a way similar to the province's Triplicate Prescription Program. Under this program, certain groups of medication deemed to have the potential for misuse or \"double doctoring\" are required to be written on a special prescription form. Wright says that this information is entered into a database, so doctors can track their own prescribing as well as their patient's habits. Drugs currently tracked by the prescription program are mostly opioids, stimulants and benzodiazepines and include oxycodone, morphine, fentanyl and methylphenidate. Philippe Lucas, a researcher with the Centre of Addictions Research of B.C. expressed concerns over those rules. Lucas, who was contacted shortly before the College's vote, says rules, such as requiring physicians to register with the College, will make medical marijuana less accessible to Albertans, and further stigmatize sick people. Lucas says extra rules and paperwork act as a disincentive for physicians to work with medical marijuana. \"I think anything that increases obstacles to access this critically and chronically ill population is unacceptable in this day in age, with the amount of information, research and knowledge we have about the therapeutic potential of cannabis, \" says Lucas, who is also vice president of patient research and services at Tilray \u2014 one of Canada's biggest medical marijuana cultivating companies. Aaron Bott, who operates Alberta's only medical marijuana dispensary, says he shares that view. Bott, who was also reached before the College's vote, says physicians in Alberta are already reluctant to approve access to medical marijuana, and new rules would make it even more challenging for sick people to access their preferred medicine. \"We don't help anybody get connected with Alberta doctors, because no Alberta doctors come forward to say you can refer patients to them, \" says Bott, whose Edmonton-based organization \u2014 the Mobile Access Compassionate Resources Organization Society\u2014 assists people in obtaining authorization to use medical marijuana. But Wright says she has \"no idea\" if the CPSA's new rules will limit patient access to medical marijuana. \"The standard of practice is not meant to prohibit that, \" she says. The College did not consult The Canadian Consortium for the Investigation of Cannabinoids, The International Cannabinoid Research Society, or the International Association of Cannabis Medicine when drafting their new standards of practice regarding the use of marijuana for medical purposes. The College's lack of consultation with these authorities concerns Dr. Arnold Shoichet, medical program director with the Medical Cannabis Resource Centre in Vancouver. \"Based on my experience supporting 2,000 patients in the use of cannabis for medical purposes, there is no doubt that cannabis can make a significant difference in the quality of life for patients suffering from a number of serious medical conditions, \" says Shoichet, in a telephone interview. Shoichet says there is considerable evidence that medical marijuana is \"more effective, better tolerated and safer\" than conventional treatments. In fact, medical marijuana user, Travis Donald, says that marijuana is a \"massively effective\" treatment. Donald, who uses marijuana to ease pain associated with kidney and spinal disease, says that doctor prescribed opiates almost gave him a drug addiction. Donald says medical marijuana, allowed him to cut down his consumption of pharmaceuticals from 30 pills a day to 26 a week. \"You can't tell me that's not medically effective, \" Donald says. \"I've cut my doctors visits in half. \" Donald, like Lucas, Bott and Shoichet, is concerned that patients in Alberta will not be able to find medical support for the care and treatment they need under the College's new rules. However, Dr. Lori Montgomery from the Calgary Chronic Pain Centre says the College's rules are not intended to limit access to medical marijuana, but rather bolster the rights of physicians. She says the impending marijuana regulations program puts physicians at risk by asking them to prescribe an \"unproven treatment. \" \"I think that part of the intention behind the standard of practice is to clarify that the science behind using marijuana for medical purposes isn't solid enough to require physicians to prescribe it, \" says Montgomery in an interview conducted before the College's vote. She also says the proposed rules will establish boundaries to better guide physicians on how to direct the use of medical marijuana safely and appropriately. \"Does that mean fewer patients might end up with the medical document signed?\" Montgomery proposes. \"That is possible. But, I would hope that would mean the ones that do end up with the documents being signed by a physician in Alberta are chosen appropriately and are using it safely. \" Other portions of the College's rules range from making physicians assess patients' risk of addiction before authorizing access to marijuana, to prohibiting physicians from dispensing marijuana.access t o medical marijuana may be limited The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta say new ruling will actually protect doctors Paul Brook S pbr ooks@cjournal.ca Photo b Y P A ul b rooks/CA l GA r Y J our NA l Medical marijuana user, Travis Donald, says marijuana has improved his quality of life and allowed him to cut down on prescription pills. calgaryjournal.ca MAY 2014 8nEWS Bovine tuberculosis in Wood Buffalo National Park's wild bison has been a problem for decades. In more recent years, it has spread beyond the boundaries of the park, and is at risk of infecting Alberta's domestic cattle herds, according to Alberta Beef Producers. If this happens, it could result in financial hardships and trade restrictions from the United States \u2014 like those that have already been imposed on Manitoba. Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic respiratory disease that can infect almost every mammal. It isn't often seen in bison, which are endangered in parts of northern Alberta. The herd in Wood Buffalo National Park, which straddles the northeastern border of Alberta and the Northwest Territories, is one of the few infected bison herds in the world. According to Todd Shury, wildlife health specialist for Parks Canada, symptoms of bovine TB can take many years to develop, but there is no cure for the disease in animals. In the late stages, the bison will become weak and emaciated, and they might develop a cough. If the sick bison aren't singled out as easy targets by predators such as wolves, they will eventually waste away and die. After death, yellowish lesions called granulomas are often found in their lungs and lymph nodes. Shury estimated that 50 per cent of the roughly 5,000 bison in Wood Buffalo National Park are exposed to the dormant form of the disease, while 30 per cent are infected with the active form in their lungs.Because no agricultural lands share borders with Wood Buffalo, there isn't much threat that the disease, which spreads most easily through nose-to-nose contact, will leap directly from its bison to domestic cattle. However, bovine TB has spread to an intermediate step: the wild bison between the park and the surrounding agricultural zones. According to Shury, there is an infected herd in the Slave River lowlands of the Northwest Territories, and another in Alberta, in the Wentzel Lake area on the southeast boundary of the park. It's those herds that could bring the disease to the province's cattle. But steps are being taken to prevent the spreading of bovine TB. Shury said that in the park itself, both the bison's movements and their reproductive rates are closely monitored, and bison-free areas \u2014 sections of land that bison are killed if they enter \u2014 have been set up around the herds to protect the agricultural zones near Fort Vermillion and La Cr\u00eate. One such \"line in the sand, \" as Lyle Fullerton called it, is Highway 35, which runs from High Level to the Northwest Territories border. Fullerton, who works with Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development, helps co-ordinate bison management in the Hay-Zama Lakes Wildlands Park. Tucked into the northwest corner of the province, Hay-Zama is home to a herd of wild bison that are currently TB-free \u2014 and Fullerton would like to keep them that way. In an effort to protect the Hay-Zama bison, any bison between the Highway 35 and Wood Buffalo National Park are not protected under the Alberta Wildlife Act. That means that, unlike in most other parts of the province, the bison in that area can be killed without regulation. If the two herds were to come into contact, it is almost inevitable that the Hay-Zama bison would become infected, increasing the risk of eventual cattle contamination. Dr. Allan Preston is the bovine TB co-ordinator for Manitoba's Riding Mountain National Park, which has dealt with the disease in its elk population. He said that, if it were to spread to Alberta's domestic cattle herds, all it would take is one cow to test positive for TB for the entire herd to be sent to the slaughter, even if the rest are healthy. This would put enormous strain on farmers and producers. It sounds like an extreme measure, but over the decades that bovine TB has persisted in Canada, complete herd depopulation \u2014 rather than just removing individual affected cattle \u2014 has proven to be the only sure way of controlling the disease, Bovine tuberculosis has left the borders of Wood Buffalo National Park, putting cattle producers on alertDisease in bison threatens alberta's cattle MaDiSon Farka S mfark as@cjournal.caTwo adult bison and a calf graze in the Waterton Bison Paddock. Photo b Y b K t ho MP son \"people really value those bison up there, especially a lot of the local Aboriginalcommunities \" TODD SHURY, Parks Canadacalgaryjournal.ca MAY 2014 9 nEWS especially since bovine TB is capable of affecting humans as well as animals, and can be fatal if left untreated. However, there is minimal risk of humans contracting the disease from bison or cattle meat and milk, as pasteurization and medical treatments are readily available in the developed world. If it does spread to cattle, bovine TB has the potential to cause major problems for Alberta cattle farmers. According to Karen Schmidt, a representative of Alberta Beef Producers, the main concern would be the trade restrictions that would be imposed if the disease spread to healthy cattle. \"If we had a case of TB in the cattle herd, that herd would have to undergo quarantine, \" she said. \"After that it's possible that our trading partners may put some testing requirements on any cattle being exported. If they put in more testing requirements, that's added cost. \" According to Dr. Kevin Steinbachs, this is already happening in Manitoba. Farmers in that province have to pay an extra $7 to $15 per head for testing before they can export breeding cattle to the United States. Steinbachs is one of many vets who handle that testing, which is the result of the history of the disease in Riding Mountain National Park's elk. \"It's extra expense and time that no one else has to worry about, \" Steinbachs said. That is why bovine TB is such a cause for concern in Alberta, and why the group representing its cattle industry is worried. Alberta's beef industry outstrips Manitoba's by a sizeable margin, having shipped over four times as many head of cattle the United States alone in 2012. Beef is also Alberta's most robust agricultural resource, having generated $3.4 billion in farm cash receipts that same year, according to Statistics Canada. Karen Schmidt said that while the health of Wood Buffalo's bison is a secondary priority, her organization's first concern is the province's commercial cattle herds. \"The risk is there and we have to take steps to minimize that risk as best we can, \" she said. \"Ideally, we would depopulate (Wood Buffalo) and then repopulate with clean bison out of Elk Island or Hay-Zama, but I'm not sure if that is a strategy that would be acceptable to the rest of the stakeholders. \" It very likely wouldn't be. When that same fix was proposed after a study was conducted in the late 1980s, there was considerable resistance from the public, who didn't like the idea of killing 5,000 animals, diseased or not. If total depopulation went ahead, not only would it be a difficult and expensive project to accomplish, it would also remove roughly half the remaining wood bison in all of Canada. \"It's a very divisive issue because people really value those bison up there, especially a lot of the local Aboriginal communities, \" added Todd Shury. \"They still hunt those animals, and they've got a very strong cultural attachment to those herds. \" Representatives of the Little Red River Cree Nation southwest of Wood Buffalo were unavailable for comment on the situation. With so many different stakeholders, the problem of how to manage bovine tuberculosis remains contentious. There have been attempts in the past to determine a solution that would satisfy them all, none have been very successful. An updated wood bison recovery strategy is in the works, but has been sitting in a draft stage for several years as the various groups involved have been unable to come to an agreement. The lack of progress on what would be a Canada- wide strategy for controlling bovine TB has been frustrating, especially for Shury. \"I used to say it will probably be released in the next year, \" he said. \"I've been proven wrong so many times that I've given up trying to predict that. \" This map shows the various locations of bison herds around Wood Buffalo National Park. Photo courtes Y of Albert A e nviron M ent A nd s ust A in A ble r esource d evelo PM entInstead of my mother reading me storybooks before bedtime like most kids got, she and I had influential talks about life and all of its contents. My mother, Jessica, would sit on the edge of my bed and tell me that everyone has a canvas. This canvas, she would say, is a metaphor for how much passion someone has for life. Depending on how an individual handles the struggles that life can bring, different colours get painted on their canvas. Everyone's canvas is unique. It could be stained with washed out colours, or it could be vibrant with opaque movement. My mother taught me that catering to the soul is what allows one to create a masterpiece. BREAKING THE NEWS I experienced a cold shock on the day my mom told me she had stomach cancer. It felt surreal, like those commercials you see on TV with bald women running marathons wearing pink snap-backs in support of breast cancer. Oblivious to the havoc she and my family were about to endure, I didn't know how to react. When she told me, we were sitting on a park bench in Princess Island Park. After, the only sound I heard was my heart throwing itself against my rib cage. The pressure was softened slightly when a passing Chocolate Lab came to lick the melted ice cream off my hand. All I knew was I had to have an ample amount of optimism. Not for myself, but for my mother in case she ever ran out. The colour purple ran down my canvas: The colour of hope. A NEW CANVAS Fact: Mom was going to lose her hair. Fact: Mom was going to grow it all back.Fact: Mom was going to lose all her strength. Fact: Mom was going to gain it all back. Rather than seeing clumps of her hair slowly dwindle away, she beat it to the punch and rocked the pool-cue look. When she was sick, she was the most pure and genuine I had ever seen her. I told her she looked beautiful, and she told me she felt like a blank canvas: Empty and colourless. WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE She always had a penchant for black and white movies. Immaculate faces; smooth with no blemishes. Perfect pin-up hair and lips that hugged vibrant white teeth. These 40s actresses were, in her eyes, untouched by the world's twisted ills. I would leave for school in the morning and she would be in the same place I had left her hours before, watching her black and white movies on channel 47. I would cup my hands over my ears to block the sound of her puking. Face in the can, she'd pop back up with the veins pulsing from her neck. With tears in her eyes from pushing so hard, she would look at me like she was embarrassed. She had an innocent, childlike face that so desperately wanted her burning insides to cool. There's no colour that can portray the feeling of guilt for pitying your own mother, just the vivid memory of heartache. MEDICAL GABBLE Two grape sized tumors were stuck to the outer layer of her stomach lining. Thankfully they weren't growing, but the little bastards gave her a 24-7 stomach ache. She couldn't hold anything down. Seeing her curled up in the fetal possession became more normal than not. Once the tumors were extracted through her belly button, she went through two rounds of chemo to make sure they weren't going to grow back. After looking like a wilted leaf for weeks on end and what seemed like endless visits to the doctor, she was cancer free two years later. At night, I'd pray to some higher power to paint her canvas with bright colours and make her feel beautiful again, beautiful in a Jessica-kind-of-way. LIFE'S SIMPLICITIES She's a horrible baker and couldn't keep a plant alive if her life depended on it. She's late most of the time, and prefers cool days over hot. She'd pick me up in the afternoon from elementary, and have my skis packed in the back. \"We're running away for the day and playing hooky, \" she'd say with a huge smile on her face. She made my costumes for Halloween, including a mouse onesie for both my dad and I one year. For going from a Chilean immigrant, to a successful owner of a real estate brokerage firm, to a cancer patient, and then to make it all the way back to the top after two years of fight, she's my hero and always will be. I have the gem of mothers, and wouldn't take anything away from my past. \"People can dissipate along with the fading memories of the things they used to do, \" she says. I think she means that people can lose sight of their canvases. They give up on painting, and eventually forget what it felt like to be vibrant and unique. My mother and I made the promise to always paint our canvas, value what makes us happy, and to always keep fighting. I know what my colours are.

I remember feeling overcome by shame when an older kid told me that the moccasins I had worn to school on National Aboriginal Day were ugly, and that we gave our elders tobacco because all we do is smoke. In my time at public school in Bassano, Alta., I felt constant guilt for wanting to be proud of who I was and where I came from. Like my ancestors before me, I felt forced to hide who I was. Frankly, I'm tired of hiding who I am because some people don't understand my culture. I am a proud Blackfoot from Siksika Nation, and Blackfeet from Montana. Canada is one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world. With the number of immigrants growing each day, our country offers cultural acceptance so their move is less of a shock. Sikh children now have the right to carry their Kirpans to school and the RCMP has allowed the turban to be a part of the official Mountie attire. Strangely, the people who inhabited Canada far before Europeans arrived are the ones whose culture is being treated the most unfairly. Last November in 2013, a teacher approached a 17-year-old Manitoba student and told him that he was not allowed to attend school if he was going to smudge before coming to class due to the smell it gives off.Smudging is the practice of burning traditional medicines such as sage and sweet grass and has been a part of First Nations culture since before the first European contact. It is used in traditional prayer ceremonies to cleanse the body and mind of negative energy. If done in the morning, it can instil a positive start to the day. CBC Aboriginal News reporter Connie Walker wrote that for Stephen Bunn from Manitoba, smudging helped him cope with the suicide of his younger brother. However, Crocus Plains Regional Secondary School in Brandon, Man. had a strict scent-free policy and told Bunn that if he was going to smudge, he had to get his mother to excuse him for the day. Sadly, this isn't the only documented case where First Nations youth have had their right to religious freedoms and practices restricted. In February 2014, Sage Windigo of Regina smudged with an elder during a school day and returned to school, only to be told to leave. His mother, Christa Windigo, said a school official told Sage in front of his class, \"I'm going to pretend I did not smell that. \" Windigo says she believes the teacher thought the smell was marijuana. This story was recently broadcasted on CKOM News Talk 650 in February. It was an ill-informed and a culturally insensitive reaction. As citizens of a country that prides itself on being culturally accepting, those teachers are doing a poor job of respecting practices that have been the centre of Aboriginal culture for centuries. I recognize that not all cultural practices are easily accepted in our diverse society. A Quebec girl was banned from a soccer game because of her hijab in 2012. Quebec nationalism has become extremely orthodox and frowns upon people in \"positions of power\" wearing religious attire while representing the province. The fact that this type of discrimination is still happening in Canada in 2014 is shocking and detrimental to Canadian society. As a society, we should be promoting diversity, and that includes appreciation of our First Nations. I was always taught to respect anyone and everyone, regardless of ethnicity. My parents encouraged me to be receptive to the values and beliefs of others, and I do not recall ever making judgements another person's traditions. For me, smudging helps me not only spiritually in connecting with the Creator, but also gives me strength to take on my day, no matter the adversity I may face. It helps me function proactively. The Alberta Human Rights Act recognizes that all people are equal in dignity, rights and responsibilities when it comes to the provision of goods, services, accommodation or facilities available to the public. This act gives everyone in Alberta the right to practice their traditions in public places. The Alberta School Boards Association November 2011 report outlines the Calgary Board of Education's regulations on Aboriginal Culture, regarding traditional practices and teachings. This includes \"valuing Aboriginal students, their culture, and contributions\" as well as \"supporting broad student participation in Aboriginal sporting, social and cultural activities. \" Catholic Schools in Calgary focus on supporting Aboriginal students as they maintain a strong link to their heritage. They encourage First Nations beliefs and have included smudging ceremonies in school events. Bunn and Windigo shouldn't feel ashamed of who they are and what they practice. It's inspiring that in this day and age, despite the bad reputation many First Nations have, they are still practicing traditional healing methods that could easily be lost or unappreciated by people their age. It's encouraging that any teenager finds spiritual outlets for dealing with life's adversity, rather than adopting the unhealthy alternatives that many young adults are prone to. Schools should be thankful that students who smudge give off the scent of sweet grass and sage rather than cigarettes and weed, because that smell is way more noxious than our native grasses. Kelsey Solway says many parts of First Nation culture is still widely misunderstood, but smudging is currently causing problems for First Nation youth in particular.photo courtes Y of kelse Y solw AYkelsey solway ksolway@cjournal.ca The practice of smudging is still cause for misunderstanding among many Canadians, Solway says.calgaryjournal.ca MAY 2014 13arT S & E n TE rTa I n ME n T Don't fret: anatomy Productions supports calgar y's underage music scene Hanna H caWSE y hc awsey@cjournal.caLocal organization provides opportunities for younger musicians to play, profit and gain exposure calgary-based indie band Deluge, has decided to pay it forward by lending a hand to the city's underage music scene. Partnering with the Queensland Community Centre, the band created Anatomy Productions in late 2012. The company, fuelled by memories of Calgary's once thriving, all-ages music community, hosts shows for bands with members who are under 18 and not yet legally allowed in many of the city's more popular late-night venues. David Drebit, lead singer and guitarist for Deluge, decided to get involved when he noticed a decline in venues for underage bands. \"We remember playing in community halls back in the day when we were really young and we started to see there was a huge decline in the all ages shows in the city, \" Drebit said. \"So we decided it was our time to start giving back. \" Anatomy Productions hosts at the Queensland Community Centre and has held 12 shows so far and plans to host shows at least once a month as the company moves forward. The profits made by Anatomy Productions are enough to sustain the company, but Drebit maintains that higher profit would allow them to do more for the scene. \"The profits make the business end sustainable, but in terms of growth, which is the most important part \u2014 getting better sound, gear and more lights \u2014 we still have a long ways to go to make all ages shows really shine, \" Drebit said. Currently, $10 tickets are provided for bands to sell ahead of each event, giving bands the opportunity for self promotion. Attendees who don't purchase tickets ahead of time can pay $10 at the door with a non-perishable food bank item, or $15 without. In order to bring as many people as possible to the shows, Anatomy Productions works with other elements in the Calgary scene that might bring in an impressive draw. \"We try to base shows around important events in Calgary music, like if an older band is releasing an amazing CD, we try to throw them an all ages release show or if a great touring band is coming through we'd try to put a show together for them, \" Drebit added. Kurt Kluba, sound technician for Anatomy Productions and bassist for Deluge, agrees with Drebit and maintains that the younger bands just need to keep trying. \"Young bands just need to stick to the guns, \" Kluba said. Kluba said he is continuously impressed by the talent that take the stage at Anatomy shows and wishes he had such skills when he was part of the under-aged scene. \"They floor me every time I see a kid who doesn't even have a moustache yet and he can shred, \" Kluba said. \"It's crazy. It's the coolest thing I've ever seen. \" Jordan Rumrill, bass player for local band Delacroix, is grateful for Anatomy. He says the company is filling a gap that was left when The New Black Centre for Music and Art closed its doors. The New Black \u2014 formerly Calgary's only under-age venue and a staple in the all- ages scene \u2014 closed its doors in late 2013 after running for five years. \"(Anatomy Productions) is what the all ages scene really needs now, \" Rumrill said. \"Since The New Black shut down it's been very dry, so we need someone to step up and have these shows. \" Rumrill adds that finding locations that allow underage bands to play is hard but worth it to be part of the music community.\"We include ourselves with the people that love music, love live music and that's what I'm in it for, the community. \" Deluge's newest member, Jordan Potekal, has been involved with Calgary's music scene for five years and is excited to be part of the opportunity to help out fellow musicians, no matter their age. \"I didn't expect to being doing this. I expected to be playing shows, \" Potekal said. \"It was kind of a really cool idea. (David) was pretty much the mastermind but we all pitched in a little bit and it became what it is now. \" Deluge uses their own equipment \u2014 speakers, lighting, microphones, mic stands among other important gear \u2014 which can be tricky at times. Every so often a band might break equipment or the bands need help setting up. Potekal maintains it's all part of the learning curve being a musician and no one is perfect from the get go. \"They're all such fresh bands. They're all really new musicians, \" Potekal said. \"That doesn't mean they're not good in any way. They're all brilliant but they're inexperienced in the way stage managing runs. It's hard to keep them on time. \"They're kids. They don't want to follow the rules all the time. This is the perfect time to start supporting these kids so they can create something bigger than we could ever create; give the seeds, the nutrients and the water. You know, they're like flowers, beautiful flowers. \" Anatomy Productions will have shows in both May and June, though the dates have not yet been set. \"This is the perfect time to start supporting these kids.\" Jordan Potekal, a natomy Productions co-founderDeluge Calgary's under-age musicians to \"beautiful flowers,\" and says that it's Anatomy Productions' job to help these younger musicians thrive.

They are all names of New York boroughs, and the names given to a litter of black Labrador puppies. The Pacific Assistance Dog Society is a non-profit organization \u2014 the headquarters for which is in Burnaby, B.C. \u2014 which facilitates the exchange of specially bred service dogs from across North America. Miranda Turenne is an MRU student who volunteers for the organization. She is training 11-week-old Bronx to help someone in need. Though they were born in Burnaby, \"their dad is from New York, \" Turenne says of Bronx's litter. \"They were all named in honour of that. \" \"My job is critical socialization, \" Turenne says. It is her responsibility to teach Bronx basic puppy manners like walking nicely on a leash, and commands like \"come\" and \"sit. \" In other words, Bronx gets to come almost everywhere Turenne goes, including her classes at MRU, so that he can encounter all kinds of new environments, people and situations. Although they go through similar training as seeing-eye dogs as puppies, The Pacific Assistance Dog Society trains dogs for people with disabilities (other than blindness). This can include mobility impairments and hearing disabilities. They also prepare puppies for work as therapy animals at places like the Alberta Children's Hospital. It's crucial for the puppies to be exposed to different situations. \"By the time they are placed with a client they are comfortable with almost anything they could possibly encounter, \" Turenne says. This includes different smells, surfaces, balconies and elevators. Bronx is Turenne's eighth puppy, and she has been working with The Pacific Assistance Dog Society for about five years. She starts working with future service dogs when they are about eight weeks old, and keeps them for up to a year-and-a-half. After that, they go back to the advanced training kennel at the society's headquarters in Burnaby. Professional trainers work with the dogs to teach them service dog skills. They learn to retrieve dropped objects, turn light switches on and off, open doors, and help people out of chairs. Turenne says that although most dogs in the program come from a family line of service dogs, only about 50 per cent make it into a service career. Dog lovers are often disappointed that they can't pet service dogs when they are on the job, but Turenne says there is a good explanation for this. \"These dogs are people lovers, \" she says. Black Labs naturally seek human attention, but unfortunately many of the clients they will be paired with are physically unable to roughhouse and roll around with them. If they become accustomed to a kind of attention that their owner can't give them, they may become attention seeking and distracted. Nonetheless, she says much of their days are spent going for walks, hanging around their homes and looking forward to meals like any other dog. \"If they are right for the program, they love doing what they do, \" Turenne says. caLgary journa L. ca MAY 2014 16 LEnS Calgarian volunteer preps pups for service careers MRU student brings her service-dog-in-training everywhere, including class Story and Photo S b y oL ivia g r E cu ogrecu@cjournal.cacaLgary journa L. ca MAY 2014 17 LEnS Turenne says it's quite common for people to stop her and ask to pet Bronx. She says she usually obliges, as long as he minds his manners and sits down first. Turenne's main responsibilities include teaching basic puppy manners and teaching Bronx how to walk nicely on a leash. Although they spend their days helping a person in need, Turenne says dogs like Bronx \"are just normal dogs.\" They look forward to meals, walks and pets from their owner like all dogs do. Turenne works with each service puppy until they are about one year old. Then, they go back to Burnaby, B.C. As the H1N1 pandemic broke in October 2009 and people lined up at the newly opened vaccination clinics, Amburlea Carlson sat in an induced coma in her bed at Foothills Medical Centre. While news headlines told the stories of this new dangerous virus, Amburlea had already been fighting it for over a month. \"I felt like I was coughing a lot, I couldn't really breathe. I felt like I had a severe cold, \" Carlson says of the symptoms she was experiencing when she went to the emergency room. Before being admitted, Carlson described herself as a very healthy 28 year old who worked out five days a week, and admittedly had never seen the necessity of getting a flu shot. Carlson was one of 1,276 Albertans hospitalized during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, a significantly higher number than this flu season when there were 884 hospitalized cases. But Alberta Health Services ran out of the vaccine on Jan. 9, 2014 after administering all 1,112,971 doses \u2014 only enough to cover 28 per cent of Alberta residents. Though influenza typically affects the young and the elderly members of society, Dr. Judy MacDonald, medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services for the Calgary zone, says the H1N1 strain appears more troublesome to young adults. She says likely the reason for this is that the older generation has seen many strains of the influenza virus and have some immunity build up that the younger population simply does not. \"It was so quick, \" Carlson says. \"Within a matter of days (at the hospital) I was fully paralyzed and put on full life support. \" Doctors induced Amburlea into a coma to help control her treatment. Her parents hardly recognized her as she sat with 11 chest tubes draining the fluid from her lungs, amidst the humming of the machines that kept her alive. Carlson remained in a coma for nearly three months. There were moments where they almost lost her and needed to shock her with the paddles to bring her back, and there were other nights where she was simply given high doses of pain killers to make her comfortable while she was expected to pass away. Although she was in a coma, Amburlea says she was able to hear most of what was going on around her. \"I remember a boy beside me, I believe he was 17, passing away and you could hear all the family there crying and stuff. It was devastating, \" Carlson says. \"I remember thinking 'Am I going to make it?' I'm probably not going to make it. \" There was one point where doctors told her parents, who had been at her bedside through the entire experience, \"she isn't going to make it, you'd better pray to your god. \" But Carlson wasn't just fighting for her own life \u2014 she was a single mother also fighting for her unborn daughter. Carlson was admitted into the hospital during the early part of her pregnancy, and although doctors worked to save both of them, their focus was on Carlson. She had been pumped with countless medications and been so close to death that they did not believe the baby had survived and were amazed when they found a heartbeat. Carlson was brought out of her coma for the caesarian section, and Briar-Rose was born on Dec. 15, 2009, nearly four months premature and weighing in at just over two pounds.\"She came out, she cried, and then she stopped breathing so she went up to the NICU, \" Amburlea says and they said it would be very critical over the next 72 hours and they weren't sure how she would do, (they said) her quality of life would probably never be there. She probably wouldn't walk. She probably wouldn't talk, \" Amburlea says. But Briar-Rose does all of that. Today, four years after Amburlea went into the hospital, they are both back home in Strathmore, Alta. Briar- Rose runs around the house like any other kid, digging her fingers into the last of the icing from her pack of Dunk-a-Roos. She sits on her mom's lap, looking through old photos \u2014 something Briar-Rose wasn't able to do until a few months ago after having surgery on her eyes to restore her vision, one of many health complications that Briar-Rose and Amburlea have had to deal with. \"It's been a tough road, \" Carlson says. Luckily she has had the support of her parents, who took her and baby Briar-Rose in during their initial recovery. Briar-Rose has mild cerebral palsy, still has another surgery scheduled for her vision, and she wears braces on her legs. They do physiotherapy and speech classes on a regular basis. Developmentally, Briar-Rose is very tiny, still only fitting into size two clothes, and her 11-month old sister is quickly catching up to her.

The doctors have said they don't know if she would survive, her lungs being so damaged, \" Carlson says. And while Carlson has worked hard to raise her miracle baby, she did so while travelling her own path to recovery, a path that she still hasn't reached the end of. \"I felt like life ended when I got it, it felt like starting over again, \" Carlson says. She had to re-learn how to walk again, how to drive again, and how to speak again, although her voice is now weakened and not what it used to be. \"I couldn't even brush my teeth. I had to rely on my parents for a lot of things, \" she says. Carlson still struggles with the ramifications of her illness years later. \"My body just can't keep up and do the same things it used to, \" she says. Carlson struggles with pain in her hands and feet from the nerve damage she suffered, and has issues with every day memory loss. Similar to Briar-Rose, Carlson also has severe issues with her breathing. \"When I get colds or get sick, even just a bladder or kidney infection, I'm usually in the hospital, \" she says.Despite all of the health complications, Carlson keeps moving onward and devotes herself to giving Briar-Rose everything that she needs. Although she says she sometimes feels guilty and responsible for some of the challenges in Briar-Rose's life, Carlson continues to watch her improve. \"They said she would never have a quality of life, she would never walk, she would never talk. She's doing all of those and above. She does dance, she does swimming, she's very outgoing, \" she says as she gleams at Briar-Rose. But Carlson also hopes that other people don't have to ever go through the same struggles that she does, and encourages people to take proactive measures to avoid contracting this common virus. \"Take care of your health, make sure you're immunized, \" she says. \"Yes, it is hours in a line up and you have to wait in a big room and there are hundreds of people, but there's a reason there's that line up and there's a reason there are hundreds of people there. You could be waiting for hours in that room or you could be waiting for months in that hospital bed to maybe pass away. That's all I can say. \" Amburlea Carlson was brought out of her coma to deliver Briar-Rose via caesarian section, four months before she was due.

As they walked, hand-in-hand in Lockeport, N.S., they noticed a man who was blatantly staring. The usual assumption of someone staring would be because the two are a lesbian couple, but that wasn't it. They are a lesbian couple, who also happened to be \"double pregnant. \" Meisner recalls quipping, \"Hey, haven't you seen a couple of pregnant lesbians before?!\" It turns out the man staring hadn't, and was merely curious about Meisner's unique situation. \"Our stereotype of small towns is that we think we're just going to be stared at and judged, \" she says. It's moments like these that can be seen in Meisner's latest non-fiction book, Double Pregnant - Two Lesbians Make a Family, an honest recollection of the journey of she and Beerends embarked upon while being pregnant at the same time. Meisner is an author, playwright and professor who teaches drama and creative writing at MRU; her book is being published by Fernwood Publishing this Mother's Day, May 11. \"It was double happy, \" Meisner says with a smile when she and Beerends became pregnant together. Growing up as a lesbian, Meisner says she didn't think having a family was possible, despite loving children and having a very large extended family. However, that changed one night when she went dancing with Vivian Beerends, Her then wife-to-be asked Meisner if they wanted to have children together. \"Somehow it just hadn't yet entered my consciousness, \" Meisner said. \"But the minute she asked me, I knew it was a 100 per cent 'yes.

Going through early schooling in a seaside- fishing town, the opportunities weren't ripe for Meisner's to translate the stories she accumulated into writing or art despite her mother surrounding her with books. \"My school itself did the bare bones, the basics, \" Meisner says. \"But maybe for me that was lucky, because as soon as I got to university, I kind of went roaring toward theatre and artistic stuff, and really found myself in the first couple years that I was at university. \" Meisner earned her first degree in English at King's College in Halifax, and later went to UBC for her Masters in Fine Arts, and finally moved to Calgary to obtain her PhD in creative writing at U of C. Beyond the ability to dig into her creative side at university, it was also the first chance she had to properly express herself openly as a lesbian. Growing up knowing she was a lesbian, Meisner used sports and the tomboy persona to coast through her early life. \"People kept asking me \u2014 as they would say back in the East \u2014 'Oh, is there no man in the offing?'\" (\"In the offing, \" is a sailor's term for someone in the distance). She recalls a particular instance in her coming-out process where she auditioned for a play at university, and the character was a lesbian. \"During the interview, I was all of 17 years old, and I had done the monologue, and they liked it, and they said, 'So, just so you know, if you get this part you'll have to kiss a woman, you wouldn't have a problem with that would you?'\" Meisner had no problem with that. \"Actually I thought that would be pretty okay, \" she says with a hearty laugh. \"I found that playing this fictional lesbian, and having people talk about that, let me kind of come out, \" she says. Meisner says that being so accepted by theatre folk is what eventually drew her towards writing for the genre in the first place. Her first two books are a collection of her plays. \"It turned out later that none of those people in the room who had auditioned with me were themselves gay, but it was just the ease in which they said, 'Oh you wouldn't have any problem with that, would you?' which set the bar for theatre people for acceptance and welcoming behaviour. \" However Meisner's welcome from the theatre community was contrasted by her experience Natalie Meisner (left) and her wife Vivi\u00ebn Beerends (right) break out of the idea of the nuclear family with their children, Jasper and Ruben. calgaryjour Nal.ca M AY 2014 20lIVIN g 'Double Pregnant: Double happy' Two married wives become pregnant at the same time by the same donor caMEroN PE rrIEr cperrier@cjournal .ca JUSTIN WILSON/CALGARY JOURNALcalgaryjour Nal.ca M AY 2014 21 lIVIN g in sports. She played basketball and soccer at King's College. \"One of the women on my team told me, 'You have to watch out for the coaches, I think they're dykes, ' without knowing, \" she says. \"I wasn't as out as I am now, and at that moment, I was in this highly charged space because we were both half-naked. \" She adds the camaraderie she gained with her teammates during those years \u2014particularly when she was searching for her identity \u2014 was interrupted by comments and cracks such as those, and says it's probably what turned her from jock to intellectual. \"It was tough, \" she says. It was through sports, however, where Meisner met her wife when she represented Canada for basketball at the 2006 Gay Games in Montreal. Beerends played for the Dutch team. Three years later, Meisner and Beerends married in Calgary in 2009. And now, their boys, Jasper and Ruben, will soon both be three years old. Their sons came to them in an unusual twist, as Meisner and her wife became \"double pregnant, \" solely based on a recommendation of their doctor. As they were at an \"advanced- maternal age, \" it was best they both try for children. But before they could start what Meisner calls \"the biggest construction project ever, \" the couple needed something neither could naturally produce: sperm. They went \"speed dating for sperm, \" as in Canada, sperm sales are against the law. Through \"dating\" potential donors in online forums or meeting in person, the couple had many close calls. Finally after two years of searching and planning, Meisner and her wife found a volunteering donor willing to offer his swimmers via artificial insemination. \"When we found Mr. Right it was amazing, \" Meisner says. \"By that time we had been through about two years of planning, hoping and dreaming. Everything kind of fell into place as he told us his reasons for wanting to be a donor and we told him what we were looking for, \" Meisner says. They traveled to B.C. to see the donor during their pregnancy and once after their children had been born in the start of fostering an open relationship between the children and the donor. When it came down to trying to get pregnant, Meisner, in her late thirties at the time, was blessed on the first try, and then on second try for Beerends, then 40. They were both about to be mothers \u2014 through artificial insemination from the one donor \u2014 within two months of each other. Meisner also recalls the different experiences between her and Beerends during their pregnancies, and says through that they had a better understanding of how each other felt during the combined 11 months. \"I think the thing that women say to their husbands in straight couples is 'you have no idea how it feels! You're never touching me again!'\" she laughs. \"And we couldn't really say that because we knew exactly how it felt. \" For instance, Meisner experienced all-day morning sickness, and Beerends once fainted at the mention of needles and epidurals during a tour of the hospital in Lockeport, where they went to have their children. For Meisner, recounting these experiences is her first crack at non-fiction work, a departure from her previous plays and poems, where she had characters and themes to filter her ideas through. \"The reason I decided to do this was that there were things that were happening to us that were so strange, that I could not make up, \" she says. \"At the point where life became stranger than fiction, I thought I had better write about this. \" Between the couple and the donor \u2014 Meisner and Beerends asked that he have his privacy and did not want him interviewed for the article \u2014 they negotiated that the donor could have a relationship with the children, but only if he and the boys want it. Meisner chimes, \"It will be up to them and our donor as life moves forward to negotiate what kind of relationship they have, but they will both have the knowledge and can do with that what they want. \" Beerends herself was adopted as a child, and had questions about her biological family hanging over her growing up. While she eventually connected with her biological roots, Beerends doesn't want that question passed on to her children. Meisner thought the pair had a story she wanted to explore through her writing and bring to others. Her foray into the arts began early in her childhood, searching for narratives and taking in the stories of the people around her in her life growing up in Lockeport. She recalls when she would follow her mother, Jolanda Meisner, to her many jobs, as Jolanda was a single-working mother. Natalie especially recalls her times at the senior's home, where she would play checkers and chess with the residents, cashing in on their wealth of stories and narratives. These days, Natalie looks back on her early writing with a cringe. She laughs that she fell into the \"typical angry woman, \" stereotype when pointing out societal flaws and inequalities. Her first work was even Natalie Meisner (left) met her wife Vivi\u00ebn Beerends (right) through sports when Meisner represented Canada for basketball at the 2006 Gay Games in Montreal.

Everything kind of fell into place.\" Natalie Meis Ner, a uthorcalgaryjour Nal.ca M AY 2014 22 lIVIN g called Vicious Circle. She says that nowadays as a married mother with years of wisdom, she uses humour to approach her topics. \"Even if it's something really tough you have to get through, if I can spin that situation around and I can laugh at my own mistake, then I find strength and power there, \" she says. \"Those same societal critiques are there, but I'm wanting to leave them, or lighten them with humour. \" In Double Pregnant, Meisner details her family's unique family life. While Ruben is biologically Beerends, ' Natalie feels Ruben is just as much hers as Jasper is. For example Ruben will come to her when he's hurt, Meisner says, and Jasper listens to her wife better. Beerends describes the benefits of how close the boys are in age \u2014 10 weeks. \"Usually children are more apart in age, but they'll be in the same class, they'll grow up together, they'll have the same interests, \" she says. Out in public on campus, the playground or the gym, Meisner says her family has received both reactions: those interested in their narrative and wanting to know more, and the stone-faced, \"You're going to Hell, \" responses to her unique family, or even the idea of same-sex marriage. When Meisner encounters people like that, she does her best to be an educator, and draws upon the importance of equality. She recalls when Beerends had to have an emergency C-section, and how, in that moment, the doctors rushed in like a SWAT team to get to her wife. \"Are you married?\" the doctor asked. \"Yes, \" Meisner fervently replied. \"The relief on her face when I said yes, \" Meisner says. \"Because it was one less form; it was so huge and I thought, 'Wow, things are really shifting. '\" \"And anyone who disagrees with marriage equality, for whatever their belief systems are, in the book I ask them to think about that moment, when someone's life hangs in the balance, \" she says. She added that you wouldn't want just anybody making that decision, you would want your spouse. Despite those occasional troubling reactions, Meisner says her different kind of family has received much more support than resistance, and her children's unique situation is what will always make her boys special. \"They'll have a difference, and the way I think about difference, whether it's your sexual identity or gender identity, who you love, whether it's the colour of your skin; I think that difference is a gift, \" she says. \"I like to think we'll be raising two of the coolest young men out there, and I think their story, their personal story, will help them. \" Her mother Jolanda commends her daughter on how her and Beerends have chosen to raise the boys. \"She's such a ground breaker, the way she parents, the way Beerends parents; they're so calm, \" Jolanda says, drawing similarities between how she parented Natalie: less television, more books, a \"Granola, hippie mom, \" style, as Jolanda calls it. \"The biggest compliment in the world is watching the similarity in how she parents as I parented her, \" she says. And with their story, Meisner and her wife hope more families like theirs can be, and feel, included in what some might feel is a heteronormative institution, and notes a lack of resources on gay parenting. \"I'm more concerned with expanding the notion of family to include queer people, that those words should be available to everybody, \" she says. \"We're kind of the walking poster child for the 21st century family, \" she jokes, but adds that in recent times there have been plenty of innovations to the traditional idea of family. \"It shows you how many ways people can make a family, and how far away we are from that 1950s or 1960s nuclear model. \" Her former Mount Royal colleague Lee Easton, now the Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences at Sheridan College, says that Meisner's book on her unique family can shine a light on their lifestyle and quell critics to bring them to more of an understanding. \"Despite the growing acceptance of gays and lesbians and our relationships, there's always a kind of unspoken question about what our relationships are 'really' like, \" Easton wrote in an email. \"This book will show that there are some similarities with other traditional heterosexual relationships, but also highlight the challenges that non-traditional families face. \" As her family continues to grow, Meisner says she won't let any discouraging reactions weigh down on her and Beerend's parenting. She thinks to the man who stared at her and Beerends in Lockeport. \"And in that moment, I had to learn that people can just be curious, \" she says.

The last time she tried to use public transit to get to the northeast Calgary Rotary Challenger Park was in the fall of 2013. After taking the train from the Rundle LRT station to McKnight- Westwinds, the only way for Salvani to reach the park was to cross the pedestrian bridge over M\u00e9tis Trail, which involved working her way up a steep ramp. Salvani said she slowly and carefully took step after step, leaning heavily on her cane. By the time she finally reached the top, out of breath and in pain, she knew she wouldn't be able to make it across the bridge and down the long path from the train station to the park, and turned back. \"I just wanted to see if I could actually go to Rotary Challenger that way, \" Salvani said. \"But just to use that ramp, it was really hard. \" As a person with a disability, Salvani is exactly who Challenger Park is meant for. The park bills itself as an accessible, barrier-free recreation facility where, according to its mission statement, \"everyone can play. \" While this may be true of the park itself, a lack of direct public transit is creating some serious barriers for the people and organizations trying to use it. Challenger Park opened its doors in 2005. It is located on the corner of McKnight Boulevard and M\u00e9tis Trail, two of northeast Calgary's major freeways. According to its executive director James Zackowski, it is the only recreation facility of its kind in Calgary \u2014 \"the only facility that was built to be barrier-free, \" he says. Alongside an inclusive playground and wide plaza with a shaded picnic area, there is also a baseball diamond, tennis courts, a football and soccer field and a running track.While the outdoor space is quiet in the winter, indoors, the Jim and Pearl Burns Centre \u2014 home of Renfrew Educational Services \u2014 buzzes with activity. Brightly coloured coats and backpacks hang on hooks in the lobby and behind the doors, the sounds of children's laughter and the squeak of sneakers on linoleum can be heard. Many people who use Challenger Park praise the quality and inclusivity of the facility itself; their complaints come from the lack of public transportation. Calgary Transit does not run service directly to Challenger Park. Its website suggests three transit locations, but all are roughly a 30-minute walk from the park itself. What's more, long stretches of the route along Pegasus Road, the only available access point from one of the bus stops, do not have sidewalks or pedestrian pathways. Calgary Transit's representative, Ron Collins, said they are aware of the problem. While rotar y challenger P ark faces public transit woes Lack of direct bus route creates obstacles for users of 'barrier-free' facility MaDIS on Far Ka S mfarkas@cjournal.ca Photo b Y MADIS o N FARKAS/CALGARY J o URNAL Mary Salvani has cerebral palsy and walks with a cane. Here, she waits at the McKnight-Westwinds LRT station, the closest Calgary Transit can take her to Rotary Challenger Park. It is still roughly a 1.5 kilometre walk that she cannot do. calgaryjournal.ca MAY 2014 24 lIVIng Calgary Transit has long-term plans to run service to Challenger Park, this will likely not happen in the foreseeable future. \"We're unable to implement the route due to a lack of funding, and other transit priorities, at least for the time being, \" Collins said. When I tested the walking conditions on Feb. 7, I was forced to walk on the road, within arm's length of passing vehicles. Though there are apparently pedestrian walkways along 48th Avenue on the east side of Barlow Trail, I had no way of knowing because at the time, they were buried in four feet of snow, which was not cleared off the path. When I finally reached the park, sweating and exhausted, I couldn't help but think that it was a hell of a hike just to go get some exercise. On top of that, I am an able-bodied person who was unaccompanied by children and not trying to push a stroller or carry athletic equipment. Mary Salvani said the walk from the suggested bus stops would have been impossible for her and other people with physical disabilities. \"I can't really see how I would walk there successfully, just because of the distance and because it's not paved, \" she said of the park, which she hasn't used for several months. \"I used to go there, but it's hard to get to unless you have someone that drives you. \" Salvani also noted that, though ramps like the one she struggled with at the McKnight- Westwinds LRT station are often seen as making a route accessible, the incline is too steep for people to easily maneuver wheelchairs. \"People are surprised how hard it is to push a wheelchair up even the slightest ramp, \" she said. Challenger Park has faced transportation problems since it opened almost a decade ago, and Salvani has been frustrated with the lack of change. \"They have a sign there that says 'Future Bus Zone, '\" she said. \"That's been there for the last 10 years. From what I understood, the City of Calgary didn't want to put a bus stop there because not enough people were going there. But I'm like, 'not enough people are going there because there's no bus stop. '\" But the lack of transportation doesn't just create obstacles for individuals, it also created a problem for the Cerebral Palsy Association in Alberta. Until 2010, Challenger Park was home to that association, but had to eventually relocate. Their associate executive director, Mezaun Lakha-Evin, said the lack of transportation was a big part of the reason why her group relocated. \"With Calgary Transit, you couldn't get to the park, \" she said. \"You'd have to walk quite a distance. It's accessible once you're in it, but getting to it is very, very difficult. \" Lakha-Evin said there was supposed to be a bridge crossing M\u00e9tis Trail into the park when it was first being designed, but it was never built. \"Somehow the ball dropped somewhere, \" she said. \"After the fact, when I brought the City of Calgary's attention to how come there was no access to the park, it was kind of a done deal because the park was already built. \" The Cerebral Palsy Association tried to get a bus stop added to the park but was unsuccessful. Though the interior office space suited their needs, they were eventually forced to leave. \"It would have been perfect if there was access, \" she said. But Lakha-Evin isn't the only one asking why the public transportation problem was never addressed proactively. Mara Kaplan is the owner of Let Kids Play, a consulting firm she operates out of Pittsburg, Pa. She works with park districts, equipment manufacturers and communities to encourage the inclusion of children of all abilities. \"When people ask me, in my consulting business, about site-selection, I do say, where's the closest public transportation?\" she said. Kaplan also noted the lack of public transportation creates economic barriers as well as physical ones, restricting access even to people who don't live with disabilities. \"If you don't create a good inclusive environment, what you're saying is that anybody who can't afford a car can't come here, \" she said. \"It's about being inclusive, and being inclusive means we welcome everyone Challenger Park has faced transportation problems since it opened almost a decade ago, and many have been frustrated with the lack of change.Photo b Y JUS t IN WILS o N/CALGARY J o URNALcalgaryjournal.ca MAY 2014 25 lIVIng to come play at our playground. Everyone can't come play if what you're saying is we've built this huge community asset in a location that people without cars can't get to. \" Though an empty field on the corner of two major roadways may seem like an unusual choice for a community destination, it was a matter of what was available at the time. The land came in a deal between the City of Calgary and the Calgary Airport Authority, who agreed to let Challenger Park's administrators manage and operate it. John Boyd, who was the president of Rotary Club of Calgary when the park was in its early stages, said that was the only possible land he had ever known about. It was the Rotary Club's idea to build a barrier-free recreation facility in the first place, which is why the park bears its name. While they were heavily involved in pushing the concept and raising money for it, they don't have any say in its day-to-day operations. \"When the site came up originally, one of the reasons why we thought it was a good site was we thought it was going to be reasonably close to the LRT line, \" Boyd said. \"But obviously it didn't do much good if there wasn't a bus connection. It's unfortunate that a lot of time, a lot of money, and a lot of resources have gone into it, and obviously the transportation is taking away from its use. We could certainly voice concern, and we should. \"While transportation directly to the park is available through Access Calgary, a division of Calgary Transit, this is not an option for able- bodied people. Access Calgary is specifically designed to provide services to people with disabilities, who must go through a screening process to judge their need of the service before they are considered eligible. They then have to book trips to and from the park in advance, which Cal Schuler, the Canadian Paraplegic Association's community development co-ordinator, said is not a particularly flexible process because it limits their ability to make spontaneous travel decisions. \"It's like the chicken and egg thing, \" he added, echoing Salvani. \"For busses to be able to come out there, they need to show that they have the numbers warranting a bus system. But then, if you can't get people out there by bus, you can't really generate those numbers. \" Schuler and the Paraplegic Association run several fundraising and awareness events at Challenger Park throughout the year, including their annual Family Fun Day. He said that, while the park would benefit from a bus stop, the fact Challenger doesn't have an equal level of use year round means it's harder to justify. Like any primarily outdoor recreation facility, its peak season is late spring to early fall, and the number of visitors drops during the winter months.James Zackowski, Challenger Park's executive director, said that was the reason why the park worked with Calgary Transit to arrange a summer-only bus route that was meant to be tested last year. However, that proposed fix fell through due to a lack of funds. \"We had it worked out with them to experiment with it last summer, and then during their budget deliberations, they had to do a number of cuts, \" Zackowski said. \"That experimentation was cut from the budget. \" But Zackowski would still like to try that experiment, saying a test run is the only way to know for sure how much a direct bus route would help the park, which currently sees 70,000 to 80,000 visitors per year. \"I think we can safely say that it would, \" he said. \"It's just a question of quantifying how many people would take advantage of it. \" The park does offer a transportations and rental cost subsidy through its Everyone Can Play Fund, which is available to organizations that help people with disabilities. However, the park has still received requests from visitors, and from groups like the Cerebral Palsy Association, for expanded public transportation. \"It's a question of, 'is the demand enough to provide the supply?'\" he continued. \"From the city's point of view, there hasn't been a big enough demand, constant demand, for them to justify putting a scheduled bus service through to the park. \" Ward 3 councillor Jim Stevenson is aware of Challenger Park's transportation problems and is working with Calgary Transit to try and rectify them. He said an expanded bus route would also be able to service the businesses along Pegasus Road. \"We're trying to figure out a re-routing of some of the busses that we have running there, \" he said. \"I'm putting a little bit of pressure on transit to try an find a solution. \" Stevenson said that the new airport tunnel, which is set to open on May 24, will bring more people through the area and hopefully help present a case for public transit. However, it is unlikely that any progress will be made before the city budget is released this fall. Challenger Park has also unveiled a new strategy, which James Zackowski hopes will draw in even more people on a regular basis. Plans are in the works for the Centre for All Abilities, facility adjacent to the park that will be the home base for several non-profit organizations. \"We're hoping in the not too distant future, that the demand will warrant a supply of at least some form of bus schedule, \" Zackowski said. \"It doesn't have to be every hour \u2014 maybe it's four times a day. \" The $32-million plan is still in its infancy, and will be paid for through a combination of government funding and private donations. Fundraising for the capital campaign could begin as early as May or June, and is slated to break ground in the summer of 2016. The completion date is set for fall of 2018.

According to the Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices Association, gluten-free eating was Canada's second most popular food trend in 2013, behind locally produced/inspired dishes at number one. Chef Michael Noble's Calgary restaurant Notable, has taken the gluten-free menu to a new level, with the help of executive chef Justin Labossiere. A year ago, Labossiere and Noble were reviewing how the number of patrons requesting gluten-free items had increased, and Labossiere was given the task to create a gluten-aware menu. With Notable's core menu being 95 per cent gluten free, Labossiere went a step further and started his own company, More Gluten Free Pasta, making fresh gluten-free pasta that he now serves at the restaurant, and also sells to other locations around Calgary. Notable, located at 4611 Bowness Rd. N.W., also recently launched a new gluten-free dessert menu. Labossiere says some of these desserts are the best he has ever created such as the Stilton cheesecake, br\u00fbl\u00e9ed and rhubarb compote. Celiac disease, as defined by the Canadian Celiac Association, \"is a medical condition in which the absorptive surface of the small intestine is damaged by a substance called gluten. This results in an inability of the body to absorb nutrients: protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals, which are necessary for good health. \" There is, however, a difference between celiac disease and gluten intolerance. Gluten intolerance is when gluten has an adverse affect on the body. Mindbodygreen.com states that symptoms vary, and may include bloating, abdominal discomfort and muscular disturbances. Jim Calverley, vice president of the Calgary Chapter of the Canadian Celiac Association, says the medical community has become more aware about testing for celiac disease. According to Calverley, people could suffer from severe health problems if their celiac disease goes undiagnosed. In Calverley's case, he could have experienced premature organ failure.\"I was slowly starving my organs, \" Calverley says. \"I was very fortunate that I had a doctor who, rather than just giving me iron pills, thought he should check for Celiac, and of course he found it. \" Testing for Celiac disease requires a blood test that will dictate further testing that often includes an endoscopy and an intestinal biopsy. Around 10 to 20 years ago, having Celiac disease would have been considered a nightmare, Calverley says. He was diagnosed with celiac disease three years ago and says since then, the availability of gluten-free products has exploded. \"Not only are we seeing a multitude of products on the shelf, but also a lot of restaurants (are providing gluten-free options), \" Calverley says. Three-and-a-half years ago, Care Bakery, located at Bay 1r 7635 44 St. S.E. began its quest to serve gluten-free bread. Owner Kerry Bennett is gluten intolerant, which provided the inspiration for her to create a gluten-free environment in order to help people with dietary restrictions like hers. This pasta dish is just one of the gluten-free options on Notable's menu. The core menu for the restaurant is 95 per cent gluten free. photo b Y J oh N GAUC h ER IMAGES all ISon B a D g E r abadger@cjournal .cacalgaryjournal.ca MAY 2014 27 FooD \"We find that almost 20 per cent of the people in restaurants are eating gluten free right now and for various reasons, \" Bennett says. Bennett bases this approximation off of the chefs that she works with and the number of gluten-free dinners they encounter at their restaurants. She explains how some people eat gluten- free food due to medical reasons, while others just like different options. Bennett also acknowledges some people eat gluten free because it's part of a trend. Care Bakery does not have a retail outlet, but Bennett works with restaurants, hotels, and also sells gluten-free breads to the Calgary Co-ops under the Care Bakery name. The Calgary Food Bank has also paid attention to changing diets by offering a celiac hamper. According to its 2012 annual report, there was a 25 per cent increase in the use of these hampers from 2011. Both Bennett and the Calgary Chapter of the Canadian Celiac Association have been involved with either donations, or the assembly of the celiac hamper, and believe this service is an important aspect of The Calgary Food Bank. Bennett says that Care Bakery donates products they don't need to The Calgary Food Bank to ensure people who suffer from gluten- related health concerns are still able to eat. \"It's really important. Everybody needs to eat, intolerances need to be taken care of, and we're taking care of other people in society, \" Bennett says. Calverley says the Calgary Chapter of the Canadian Celiac Association is grateful for companies' contributions to The Calgary Food Bank so they can offer gluten-free products. A representative for the Calgary Food Bank could not be reached for comment. \"We work very closely with The Calgary Food Bank, \" Calverley says. \"One of our volunteers goes over there and does the actual stuffing of that hamper, just to make sure that the people who are asking for it are getting what they need. \" Although not a celiac himself, Labossiere explains that through his business venture he has become educated about celiac disease, and treats it very seriously in the kitchen. Notable buys bread from Care Bakery and Labossiere says the restaurant has a separate toaster for Bennett's gluten-free bread in order to prevent cross contamination. \"It's the way of the future, it's not a trend. It's a legitimate health concern and a disease, \" Labossiere says. \"It's also a diet now. You can't ignore it. \" Whether an association, a bakery, or a restaurant, some people in Calgary are determined to provide knowledge, and food options, to those who may be affected by gluten-related health issues. The Canadian Celiac Association says it is estimated that one in three Canadians are affected by celiac disease. photo b Y l ARISSA pI N h A l/CA l GARY J o URNA l Kerry Bennett began her quest to serve gluten-free bread three-and-a-half years ago. Bennett is gluten intolerant herself, which inspired her to create more options for other people with eating restrictions similar to hers.

The bread, with the bakery's logo baked right into it, is donated to The Calgary Food Bank if it is not needed. photo b Y l ARISSA p IN h A l/ CA l GARY J o URNA l As general manager Chad Thomlinson stood and took in the extensive damage to his beloved golf course last June, he was in shock and utter disbelief and thought it all might be over. Twenty five of the Highwood Golf and Country Club's 27 holes had been devastated, covered in a thick layer of silt and debris that seemed to stretch on for miles. All that remained was the green of a par three, the fairway and half of a par four hole. High River's only golf course was just one of several courses to be greatly affected by the floods that devastated Calgary and much of southern Alberta last June. Now that the water has long since receded, things are slowly beginning to return to normal and things are looking up. For golfers, this spring will be a major step in that return to normal life after a major disaster. Beating the odds \"Certainly last June and July I didn't know if we would be here, realistically, \" says Thomlinson, reflecting on his first thoughts last season as he and Highwood Golf and Country Club prepare to open for the 2014 golf season. \"Looking back, I'm proud we are getting open. \" Luckily, says Thomlinson, the $4.5 million dollar clubhouse that was built in 2010 survived unscathed, eventually becoming a main centre for recovery operations for High River, which had lost most of its municipal buildings. Now Highwood Golf and Country Club eagerly anticipates opening day which will come in the first week of May. The course will have nine holes and a driving range open on day one with a second set of nine in mid-to-late May, bringing the total up to a full 18 holes. Plans are also in the works, in conjunction with the town of High River, to construct flood mitigation through the property with the option to add four more holes in the future, bringing Highwood's total up to 22. Not wanting to get ahead of himself, Thomlinson recognizes that there is still plenty of work to be done and that for now they are looking forward to giving golfers the experience they've come to be known for since the course's inception in 1958.Ready to Roll Being able to relate with Highwood, Richard Hardy of Calgary's McKenzie Meadows Golf Course is looking forward to a bounce back year as well. Last summer, the course, which is situated in the river valley of Calgary's south east quadrant, was decimated by the rushing river. \"We never reopened again, \" says Hardy who is the course's head golf pro. \"The course was closed for the season. We got hit pretty hard and lost three greens and most of our fairways. \" Hardy, doesn't want to dwell much on the past though as McKenzie Meadows anticipates an opening date of May 15 with a full 18 hole course. Thanks to the efforts of volunteers and staff who stuck around for the year despite the course closing up, the course was refurbished and ready to once again entertain the city's avid golfers. \"It was pretty much a whole redo, \" says Hardy about the recovery. In total all sand bunkers were redug, lined and filled with fresh, white silica sand and 20 acres of sod was laid with an additional 17 acres being seeded. \"We were cutting sod right in to fall, but now we're ready to go from tees to greens, \" says Hardy, barely able to contain his enthusiasm. Despite the extensive work, the course route still remains familiar to those who have golfed it before. Rather than remove all of the silt that was deposited by the flooding, McKenzie used it to make new berms to shape some of the holes and give them a little more definition. \"We're just excited to get going again, says Hardy. \"It's been a long hard year and now we can get back to golf and servicing the customer. We can't wait. \" t he futu R e is BR ight Inglewood Golf and Curling club was a landmark course in the heart of the city that received extensive damage last year as well, but thankfully, was able to reopen nine of their 18 holes for the latter part of last season. \"We plan on being fully operational come May 1, \" says Jeff MacGregor, head golf pro at the prestigious course. MacGregor assures golfers that not much has changed in the looks of the course, give or take a few trees. \"It will actually be better with brand new sod and an irrigation system, \" he adds. With courses back in the game, aces and duffers alike will have plenty of options for getting in some fresh air and put the flood of 2013 further in the rear view mirror. cAlg A ryjourn A l.cA M AY 2014 28SPorT S calgar y and High riv er golf courses ready to spring into 2014 season Many of the hardest hit courses are ready for a return after a lot of hard work geoff crAne gcr ane@cjournal.ca Highwood Golf and Country Club's GM, Chad Thomlison, is excited to reopen the beautiful course this May, an important benchmark in the recovery from 2013's devastating floods that affected much of southern Alberta.Photo courtes Y of h ighwood g olf A nd c ountr Y c lubcAlg A ryjourn A l.cA M AY 2014 29 SPorT S Cottonwood Golf And Country Club: l ocated in d e w inton, situated just off the b ow r iver, was inundated by floodwaters last June.

Photo courtes Y of K A n A n A s K is c ountr Y g olf c ourseWhen Mark Suchlandt departed from his home on Sunday, Aug. 11, 2013 to head to the Calgary Sport and Social Club for a dodgeball tournament, he didn't feel like anything was wrong with him. However, soon after the first match started, his health situation changed entirely. At the age of 35, he suffered a heart attack. \"The game had just started,\" Suchlandt, now 36, says. \"I ran to the line and I went from feel-ing great to head-to-toe nauseous. I was dizzy. I could barely stand up. \"My friends wanted to call an ambulance but I kept saying 'I'm fine.' Some of my friends suggested I could have had a heart attack. Well, I can be stubborn sometimes, so I said 'no I will drink some water and rest.'\" Not everyone noticed he had a heart attackJessie Meier, Mark's friend and dodgeball teammate (but that day opponent) says: \"At first when he fell down and sat out a couple of games, we didn't think much of it. We said, 'Silly Mark, he probably hurt himself again.' It wasn't till later we realized something serious happened. It's great others were aware and got him to go to the hospital. Suchlandt points to an unhealthy lifestyle as the chief cause of the heart attack. Suchlandt, who is 5-4, was overweight at 171 pounds (ideal range is 117-143 pounds). \"I believe if he didn't take up marathon running it would have happened even earlier,\" Sara Suchlandt, Mark's youngest sister, says. FINDING RUNNING Suchlandt discovered his passion for running in 2011, during a difficult time in his life. \"I had a bunch of health ailments hit me at once (including a gall bladder surgery and leg growth surgery), and I was going through a break-up with a girlfriend,\" Suchlandt says. \"I needed something I could control and I needed a way to clear my head.\" Friends encouraged him to give running a try. Suchlandt heeded that advice and decided to register for the Walt Disney World Mara-thon Weekend in Florida in January 2012. He completed two half marathons (13.1 miles). He enjoyed the experience so much he partici-pated in the Disneyland event in September 2012, and Walt Disney World again in January 2013. Suchlandt has completed five half-mara- thons, four five kilometre races, and he made it through 22 of 26 miles in the Walt Disney World full marathon. \"I am no elite athlete,\" Suchlandt says. \"I may never win one of these races or place high. For me, races are about setting goals, having fun and meeting other people. I feel so happy and so energized when I am running.Comeba C k Suchlandt was in the hospital for a week after his heart attack. He went into bypass surgery on Aug. 15, and ended up going into cardiac arrest during the surgery, which resulted in him spending a couple more days in the hospital. Allowing this incident to destroy his life wasn't an option. He went into cardiac rehab to work towards returning to sports By completing rehab, Suchlandt dropped to 147 pounds. \"I always try to step out of my comfort zone and take risks,\" Suchlandt says. \"I just had a desire to get back on the treadmill again and go to the gym to run after rehab was done. I never doubted for a moment that I could come back.\" Suchlandt has improved his running times as he gets closer to his comeback race, which is the Jugo Juice 10 kilometre race as part of the 50th Annual Scotiabank Calgary Marathon. \"What comes with getting better is realizing I will never be as fast as I was but I will do what I can to finish the race,\" he said. \"I'm excited.\" For now, he can take pride that he is living a healthier lifestyle, which was fueled by a desire to return to sports. calgaryjournal.ca MAY 2014 30 SPorT S From heart attack survivor to marathon runner How one man used sports as his inspiration to recover QuInTon a M un DS on qamundson@cjournal .ca Photo courtes Y b Y M A rk s uchl A ndt For Mark Suchlandt, marathon running is about having fun, setting goals and socializing with people.

I don't think that's very empowering for women. \" It sounds remarkably simple, but women can get involved in the engagement process as well. Many couples today go ring shopping together to pick out the perfect engagement ring. They discuss different options for proposals and many will create a budget together as well. Once you're married you will have to make many decisions together that will highly impact one another. Why should this one be any different? You could even call it practice. Engagement rings are expensive, yet the man is assumed to fork over the cash and common \"knowledge\" says that he's required to spend at least two months salary on it. Krystal Walter, a professional matchmaker who brings couples together in Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver and Toronto says, \"I think it depends on how the couple gets engaged. If they plan the engagement together, they may decide together that's a cost that they want to share. \" She notes that most of the engagements that she sees are \"traditional, \" with the man surprising the woman with a ring that he purchased himself. \"The wedding and the ring is one day, \" Walter says. \"If you want to be together and spend all that money, then at the end of the day it's gone. However, there are a lot of people who don't have a lot of money for a big wedding, and they want to be logical about how they're spending their money. \"I like the idea (of splitting the cost), but I think it depends on the couple and what their situation is and how they get engaged. \" Diamonds are also expensive, and, to be honest, not as rare or expensive as we're led to believe. The popular science website (and television show) How Stuff Works took a look into diamonds and their value. Author of the article \"How Diamonds Work, \" Kevin Bonsor, writes: \"In truth, diamonds are no rarer than many other precious gems. They continue to demand higher market prices because the majority of the diamond market is controlled by a single entity. \" Supply exceeds demand, but since diamonds are essentially a monopoly, false scarcity is created and diamonds are heavily marked up. Due to excellent public relations work by international diamond cartel, De Beers, most of us believe \"A diamond is forever. \" However, you can get the flawless-diamond look from lab-created gems such as moissanite that are less expensive than a diamond but have the same brilliance and strength at a fraction of the price. Or you could go completely different and pick a coloured gem such as ruby or sapphire. It doesn't really matter, you can decide whatever you want for your ring, because it's your ring. Why should women get all the bling, and why do men not need to show society their relationship status? Palmer says that although she's not opposed to the concept of engagement rings, she does feel that traditionally they're a little one sided. \"It's like this giant symbol that flashes and everyone can see it, and it basically says, 'Don't talk to me, don't come near me, I'm taken, '\" Palmer says. \"But, the man (traditionally) wears no such symbol. It's almost like he has permission to still keep his eyes open and look for someone else. Then the couple is engaged for two or three years and the woman wears this thing that says 'I'm taken, I'm property, ' for two or three years and then the man wears nothing? It's just not fair. \"There are plenty of nice rings out there for men, and many jewellery stores now even have male engagement ring sections. If you want to be extra bold you could go the route of Johnny Depp and wear a female engagement ring. Although he recently went on the Late Show and admitted to David Letterman that the ring was simply too large for his fianc\u00e9e, Amber Heard, but decided to keep the larger one for himself. \"I put it on, \" he said. \"She has the other one that fits. \" For some, the idea of the engagement ring is too entrenched in patriarchal tradition for them to even bother with the engagement ring. Feminist writer Emily Heist Moss writes about her feelings towards engagement rings in an article posted on RoleReboot.org: \"It is a symbol that she is no longer a single woman, 'bagged and tagged' as my roommate says. Both partners have made this formal commitment, but only he is required to pony up the dough, and only she is required to display her changed status in a public fashion. \" At the end of the day, it is personal preference on what you do for your engagement. Engagements are about two people: you and your fianc\u00e9.aP r I l lamb alamb@cjournal.caThe rules of engagement Throw convention out the window and get engaged on your terms 1.

Split the costAre you tired of the worn out trope that before you get married a man must get down on one knee and ask a woman to marry him, provided that he has spent at least two months salary on a diamond ring that he picked out all by himself? Many women and men around the world are deciding to take ownership and shake up tradition. If you're exhausted of this tired tradition then here are a few ideas to put a pin in clich\u00e9 engagements. Who needs a diamond? Change up your engagement ring by going with a coloured gem instead. PHOTO BY APRIL LAMB/CALGARY JOURNAL "}
