Keywords homeopathy complex systems nanostructure protein corona biological identityAbstract Background Evidence indicates that homeopathic medicines are complex self-organizing nano-scale systems that generate unique low-intensity electromagnetic signals and/orquantum coherence domains. In Part 1, we reviewed relevant concepts from complexadaptive systems science on living systems for the nature of homeopathic healing.Aim In Part 2, we discuss the complex-system nature of homeopathic medicines. The aim is to relate the evidence on the nature a nd properties of homeopathic medicines to the complex systems model for homeopathic healing.Methods and Results The work is a narrative review, with complexity model development for the nature o f homeopathic medicines. Studies suggest that homeo- pathic manufacturing generates nano-struct ures of source material, silica and silicon quantum dots if succussed in glassware or including botanical source materials; orcarbon quantum dots if succussed in plastic or including any organic source materials,as well as solute-induced water nano-structures carrying medicine-speci c information. On contact with physiological fluids (e.g., blood plasma), there is evidence that nano- structures additionally adsorb individualized patterns of the recipient 'so w np r o t e i n s on to their surfaces to create a unique protein corona coat (shell). Thus, the simillimum may generate a personalized biological iden tity upon administration. Consequently, a medicine can serve as an individually salient, self-similar information carrier, whoseprotein corona constituent pattern re flects the individual 's current internal state of health/disease. Homeopathic medicine complexity emerges from interactions of thecomponent parts from source, silica from gla ssware or carbon from plastic containers, solvents (lactose, water, ethanol), adsorbed biomolecule layers from plant or animalsources, and adsorbed biomolecules of the recipient. Low doses of these complexmedicines can act as biological signaling agents to initiate hormesis via a network-wide pattern of adaptive responses by the recipient complex adaptive system, rather than as conventional pharmaceutical drugs. Biological mediators of adaptive responses includeinter-connected network elements of the cell danger/damage defense system: forexample, gene expression, reactive oxygen species, heat shock proteins, cytokines, macrophages, T-cells, and associated brain -immune system mediator pathways.

Published online: 2019-11-30Introduction This two-part paper focuses on the integrative model for the complex, self-organizing nature of both (a) recipient living systems1-4and (b) homeopathic medicines5-10as the basis for homeopathic healing. In Part 1, we covered thebasics of complex systems science to frame understanding of health and disease. Living systems are inherently com- plex adaptive systems (CAS). In Part 2, we synthesize andintegrate thinking from a growing body of research on the nature of homeopathic medicines with evidence from modern nano-science to accommodate the data in the eld. These concepts are empirically testable with appropriate study designs. Homeopathic medicines are not conventional drugs. Conventional drugs act via biochemical, mechanistically targeted, speci cdirect local effects . In contrast, in this complexity model, the correct homeopathic medicine servesas a low-dose stimulus or individualized signal for inducing patterns of functional adaptive changes globally and locally in the body. The homeopathic signal captures and conveys alow or weak \"dose \"of the salient complex disease frequency information to the body, thereby setting in motion personal- ized hormetic (biphasic, non-linear) adaptive multi-system responses to reverse the disease. 11 In this proposed model, the homeopathic potency signal derives from the manufacturing process. The form of the \"signal \"may include multi-component core-shell nano- structures from (a) source, (b) doped silicon dots from glassor (c) carbon dots from polymer plastic containers or organic manufacturing materials (lactose, ethanol, plant or animal medicine source materials) during succussions, (d) solute-and electromagnetically induced self-organized water nano- structures, and (e) surface-adsorbed biomolecules of the recipient patient upon administration. For mineral or miner-al salt homeopathic medicine sources, the source materials may serve as dopants that tune the properties of whatever nano-structures form. 12-15 In the present model, electromagnetic and/or optical (photon-based) information, including quantum mechani- cal, arises from the manufacturing procedures.16There is nano-science evidence that the body would recognize the personal salience of the homeopathic potency signal to its current disease state because of the personalized proteincorona shell from the recipient individual 'so w nb i o - molecules that would immediately adsorb to form a coating around the surfaces of the medicine-related nano-structures on contact with the individual 'sb i o l o g i c a l fluids. 17,18It is well established that the constituent proteins from the blood plasma that form the proteincorona on contact with a nano-structure re flect the current disease and/or physiological state of the individual pa- tient. 17The nano-biointerface becomes the ultimate area for treatment personalization. Homeopathic Medicines as Complex Systems Given the complexity model for how healing occurs (see Part 1 of this paper), what is a homeopathic medicine that can initiate such dramatic changes in the body? Converging evidence indicates that a homeopathic medicine is itself acomplex nano-scale system. 19Homeopathic medicine com- plexity emerges from the interaction of the component parts from source, glass (silica) or plastic (carbon) containers,solvents (lactose, ethanol, water as additional surface modi- ers, and as carbon sources in the case of lactose and/or ethanol as well as organic source materials) and, ultimately,the surface-adsorbed human biomolecules of the recipient at the moment of treatment dosing. At least two separate lines of research support this postulate. First, the homeopathic potency is capable of self-orga- nizing and inducing formation of self-similar nano-struc-tures in surrounding water. 5,8,20 -27Second, multiple studies of plants have shown that homeopathic potencies induce formation of self-organized, unique poly-crystallinestructures in the exudates of treated plant seedlings versus controls. 6,7,28,29In other words, homeopathically prepared medicines may induce formation of self-similar crystallinenano-structures in water and/or in biological fluids within a living system. These medicines may induce patterns of self-similar crystalline information in their surroundingenvironment. 30 Traditional homeopathic manufacturing processes gener- ate nano-scale structures that may or may not includemeasurable amounts of source material (with measurement limited to the practical detection limits of the instrumenta- tion), 31-37lactose if triturated (milled) with an insoluble source material, and, if succussed in classical glassware stoppered with natural corks, silica38and/or cork silica coatings41,42and silicon quantum dots43are well- known to contribute not only electronic but also biological ampli cation effects.44-52Doping and/or coating core nano-Simillimum individualization derives from formation of a unique personalized protein corona shell adsorbed to the reactive surface of the homeopathic nano-structures oncontact with the recipient 'sb o d y fluids. Low doses of such complex nano-structures initiate the adaptive processes of hormesis to mobilize endogenous healing of a diseasestate. The capacity for self-organization and self-similarity in complex systems is the key to future research on the nature of homeopathic medicines and systemic healing during individualized ho meopathic treatment.

Nanoparticles ingeneral possess extremelylarge reactivesurface areastowhich other nanoparticles and materials can adsorb, as a function of their nano-scale size. Because of their extremely small sizes,quantum dots also acquire unique electromagnetic, optical, and quantum mechanical properties. 59 As an aspect of manufacturing-generated nano-struc- tures, one study in mainstream nanotechnology indicates that ultrasound agitation of a salt solution (sodium chloride, potassium iodide) creates nanoparticles of the sourcematerial and concomitantly embeds them onto glass or polymer slide surfaces in contact with the liquid. The resultant nanoparticles can then leach back into thesolution over time. 60This type of phenomenon parallels what succussions might cause in any mineral salt solution. Thendings further suggest the need to compare both composition and structure of nano-structures generated during Hahnemannian (different containers for every dilu- tion -succussion step) (the same for dilution -succussion steps at higher potencies) manufacturing methods. Furthermore, if succussed in plastic polymer containers, it is likely that the manufacturing container, along with any lactose, ethanol or other organic materials of plant or animal origin also in solution, might also contribute photo-lumines-cent carbon quantum nano-dots ( -65Carbon dots are now a major nano-component of sensitive sensors andsignal ampli ers for extremely low quantities of speci c physiological metabolites and biomolecules, mineral ions, herbs, vitamins, drugs, volatile organic compounds, and other agents. 66-69As a proof of principle, it is even possible to process food waste water sources per se to synthesize photo-luminescent carbon nano-dots from their organic source material.70,71 Thus, homeopathic medicines containing carbon dots might literally serve as very crude sensor-carriers for the medicine source material and its constituent information at profoundly low femtomolar72or picogram concentra- tions.73,74One research group has termed certain carbon dots as \"optic noses \"for detecting and amplifying the signal of small quantities of their target agent.68Not surprisingly, carbon as an element is detectable in plant-derived homeo- pathically prepared medicines.19,34 Recent work by Cartwright suggests that the homeo- pathic medicine 's signal may depend on its dipole moment properties. Dipole emissions are a capability also docu- mented for certain carbon nano-materials such as carbonnano-dots. 65As is true for other types of nano-materials, it is possible to tune carbon nano-dot properties by doping, modifying particle surfaces with different func-tional groups and adsorbents and/or changing pH. 75In parallel, Elia 's laboratory previously demonstrated that pH changes induce measurable heat release andalterations in electrical conductance of homeopathically prepared medicine solutions.8 Furthermore, multiple research groups have reported evidence that homeopathic manufacturing induces persis- tent formation of electromagnetic signal-induced, water formed of many microscopic crystallites) by Meessen.5Crystalline structures at the nano-scale (or larger) spontaneously self-organize from an interaction of their constituent parts with eachother and with their environment. A crucial characteristic of nano-structures is that their large surfaces are highly reactive and interactive with their immedi-ate environment. 78Materials in that environment, including but not limited to other nano-structures and various mole- cules (e.g., organic materials from lactose, plant or animalproteins and nucleic acids, dyes and/or minerals/ions in colloidal solutions with nano-structures), will attach (adsorb) to the outer surfaces of nano-scale structures to form newlayers, coatings, or shells around the nano-structure. 78-80 Multiple factors, especially surface structure and surface energetics, as well as pH of the surrounding solution,81 modulate the emergent properties of the resultant nano- structure coating. During the agitation such as sonication, vortexing, or manual succussions of a colloidal nano-structuresolution, some of those elemental constituents, for example, nitrogen or phosphorus, as well as ethanol, may also dope the particles. 58,80,82The implosion of succussion-induced nano- bubbles that form around or near nanoparticles would also add heat energy and pressure effects in generating homeopathic medicine nano-structures.31,83 -86These coatings and dopants can signi cantly alter the physical, chemical, and biological properties of any given nano-structure.53 Some recent research indicates that the composition of nanoparticles found in homeopathic medicines may not always contain detectable amounts of the source materialbecause of the detection limits of the available technology. 19 As always, lower limits for detection ability of the measure-ment instruments can be a methodological factor in thesetypes of ndings. However, apart from debate over what the composition of the nanoparticles might be, 19there is nonetheless ample convergent evidence for the presence of poly-disperse (heterogeneous sizes) nano-structures and other materials in homeopathically prepared medicines.32,40Evidence shows that homeopathically prepared medicines, even in higher potencies diluted past Avogadro 's number for bulk forms of source materials, nonetheless retain the thermo-luminescence signature signal of the original source material. 87,88 Sizes of homeopathic medicine nano-structures studied range from the size of quantum ( <10 nanometers) to isolated nanoparticles ( <100 nm aggregates measuring hundreds of nm in size.32,34 -37,39,89,90Data on variations in sizes and zeta potentials (surface electrical charge properties at the interface with surrounding liquids) and calorimetric pH effects on potentized medicines further indicate Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 2/2020Complexity of Homeopathic Healing Response \u2014Part 2 Bell 53 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. differences from controls, consistent with possible differences in nano-structure coatings.8,19,38,39,76,77,90,91 It is also important to note for any homeopathic medi- cine that the cumulative effect of a greater number of triturations (mechanical milling in dry lactose) or ofsuccussions (vigorous agitation in liquid solvent) to make higher potencies affect the nal, albeit heterogeneous, nanoparticle sizes. 92Such procedures likely parallel the progressive reductions in nanoparticle sizes that occur with longer periods of mechanical milling, vortexing or ultrasonication in conventional top-down nano-technologymanufacturing. 93,94As a result, smaller sized nanoparticles occur in relatively greater quantities at higher versus lower potencies.92There is also the potential for a low dose (i.e., smaller quantity or concentration) by smaller size (e.g., homeopathic potency nano-structures) interaction in pro- ducing various biological effects.18,95 Notably, nding evidence for a given type of agent, struc- ture, process, or signal does not preclude the concomitant existence or possible role of another one in homeopathicinformation capture and delivery to the organism. In physics, electrons in atoms are electromagnetic phenomena. When an electron absorbs a photon, the electron jumps to a higherenergy level. During quantum con nement of atoms and their electrons near the surface of the smallest sized nano-struc- tures, photons (light particles, optical signals) are emittedwhen electrons move from a higher to a lower energy state. Pastndings of electromagnetic, 8,25,26optical,87,88,96,97or other signals98-100emitted from homeopathic medicines do not preclude the initial generation of different types and sizes of nanoparticles during manufacturing,19,31 -37,39,89,90,101,102 including the presumptive electromagnetic signal-induced already ob- served in potentized medicines.32,35 -37Gayen et 200C potency into an electroactive polymer lm in the electronic industry markedly enhanced the conductivity anddielectric constant of the lm. 103Again, homeopathic medi- cines to acquire photo-electronic properties during traditional manufacturing procedures. Nano-structures formed in the course of serial dilutions and succussions during manufacturing, even if they repre- sent interaction of information-containing quantum coher-ence domains with water, 19,27,104 -106would themselves be able to generate weak (low intensity) electromagnetic and optical signals.25,26,63,103,107 Homeopathic medicine nanoparticles that are as small as quantum dots ( <10 nm in diameter)32,35 -37comprise small numbers of atoms with their electron clouds trapped close tothe particle surface. As a result, electron movement in quantum dot-sized nanoparticles can lead to quantum connement, quantum entanglement, and quantum coher- ence phenomena, as claimed by other researchers for higher homeopathic potencies. 77,96,104,108 -116 Indeed, some investigators have proposed that the medi- cine information emerges from persistent supra-molecular aggregates of water, re flective of quantum coherence domains at the nano-scale.10,27,105,106,117The signal informationderives from the original homeopathic manufacturing process of serial dilutions followed at each dilution step by multiplesuccussions (intense agitation or shaking of the liquid carrier, i.e., the non-linear dynamics of fluid turbulence). 27,98 -100,106 Of relevance, there is a separate body of evidence for the eld of quantum biology,118 -123including observations that bio- logical information transfer occurs at the nano-scale level of the organism.10,23,26,108,120,121,123 -131 Thus, there are multiple types of materials and sizes of nano-structures documented in homeopathic medicines at a wide range of potencies. Skeptics have long questionedhow any homeopathic medicine could exert different effects from any other homeopathic medicine if it were composed of\"just \"silica nanoparticles or some other material com- mon in homeopathic manufacturing. Variations in particle sizes, cores and surfaces, as a function of the methods and materials used during manufacturing, may provide much ofthe answer. Complex interactions between the surfaces of the medicine nano-structures and the recipient patient 's own biological fluids \u2014for example, plasma or serum pro- teins \u2014may provide the rest of the answer. 18 T h eR o l eo ft h eN a n o - B i o i n t e r f a c ei n Homeopathic Potency Effects Moreover, during treatment, homeopathic medicine-speci c information may derive from both (a) the complex electro- magnetic and/or quantum properties of the medicine itself, and (b) the emergent biological disease state of the individu-al recipient. In the present model, it is not possible to discover the scienti c basis of homeopathic individualiza- tion by studying only the medicine, in isolation from itsinteraction with the individual patient who needs it. The nano-biointerface plays an essential role. That is, critics of a nano-medicine model for homeopathic medicines overlook the enormous area and reactive nature of the surfaces of nano-structures. 78Other materials in solution with the nano-materials adsorb to the surface of most nano-structures. Most nano-technology research shows that presence or absence of ethanol in solutionwill affect the properties of the resultant nano-structures and their surfaces. 58,132,133Smaller versus larger particle size affects the nature of the protein corona layer adsorbedonto a given particle. 18Thus, although it is possible to make seemingly \"cleaner \"or\"simpler \"potentized medicines for research study as nano-structures, the precise materialsand methods during their preparation for clinical or research use will in fluence their ultimate properties in vitro and in vivo. More important for homeopathic treatment, on contact with an individual 'sb o d y fluids (e.g., plasma, serum, and saliva), homeopathic nano-structures, like any nano-struc-tures, would adsorb onto their surfaces various patterns of not only other materials in solution during manufacturing, but also a complex speci c pattern of endogenous proteins from the recipient organism. 134Sick organisms exhibit unique disease- and patient-speci c patterns of proteins in body fluids (Fig. 1 ).135,136 Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 2/2020Complexity of Homeopathic Healing Response \u2014Part 2 Bell 54 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Protein adsorption from the recipient 's blood onto homeo- pathic nano-structures creates a protein corona layer (coating,shell) that would thereby generate a unique biological identity from that person 's biological state. 137 -142Notably, different allopathic diseases and clinical states (e.g., pregnan-cy) in conventional medicine can generate different protein corona patterns from human blood plasma on nano- structures, including both silica and polystyrene nanoparticles( Fig. 1 ).135,136,141,143 Disease-related metabolomics play a role in how blood plasma proteins interact with exogenous nanoparticles.136 Smaller nanoparticle sizes, which occur at greater concen- trations in higher versus lower potencies,36,92are known to modulate the formation, composition, and properties of theprotein corona that becomes the nanoparticle coat. 17,18,134 In vivo, higher versus lower action. 144 Consequently, homeopathic nano-structures in any poten- cy would instantly acquire a unique, individualized identity from the patient 's current biological state upon administration. As a result, the simillimum would serve as a low-dose, personalized nano-encapsulation of the patient 's current clinical state to signal the need for adaptive biologicalresponses to the emergent disease process. In this model, smaller nano-structures, including quan- tum dot sizes, especially in higher homeopathic potenciescreated by the cumulative effects of large numbers of succussions, would show not only smaller particle sizes, 92 but also particle size-related variations in protein coronas formed on contact with the recipient 'sb i o l o g i c a l fluids (e.g., blood serum or plasma).134 In turn, the smaller nano-structures in higher potencies with their particle size-dependent unique protein coronas might initiate different biological effects than would larger nano-structures with their adsorbed protein coronas at lower homeopathic potencies ( Fig. 2 ). Consistent with this hypothesis, a recent plant-model study revealed that agreater number of succussions improves the effectiveness of a given medicine potency (45x) in fostering more robust plant seedling germination resilience to a toxic stressor. 28 Hormesis is a well-documented adaptive biological phe- nomenon in CAS involving low-dose stimulation versus high- dose inhibition or toxicity of function.145If the homeopathic medicine dose is quantitatively low, that is, in the hormetic range,146the present model predicts that the nano-medicine information with its personalized biological identity fromthe protein corona would stimulate non-linear systemic changes in the opposite direction to the emergent current disease pattern for that speci c patient. The scope and speci city of the response derive from the initial conditions (i.e., dynamical biological state of the disease) of the recipient complex adaptive system. Theoutcome would be multiple changes in the direction of healing. For instance, acute and chronic in flammation underlie the dysfunction and pathologies across a broadspectrum of disease processes. 147However, homeopathic medicines typically mobilize multiple reversals in the biological/symptom manifestations of whatever disease orhealth conditions that a given individual may be experienc- ing. Thus, in homeopathic treatment, the quantitatively lowdoses of the simillimum medicine should exhibit evidence of some anti-in flammatory effects across different diseases as part of the systemic change. In mechanistic hormesis research, Calabrese et al have documented that quantitatively low doses of many different agents/stressors \u2014including but not limited to nano-sized particles 145\u2014initiate hormesis by patterns toward anti-in flammatory effects .148In contrast, high or toxic doses of such agents/ stressors induce macrophage pro-in flammatory effects.148A question that simillimum treatment modulates epigenetic expression ofinflammatory to favoring macrophage anti-in flammatory activation patterns. Thus, homeopathic treatment involves treating the indi- vidual patient literally with a quantitatively low dose of his or her own current holistic biological disease state informa- tion at the nano-scale level (the homeopathic simillimumin vivo as a personalized hormetic stimulus). This rst step initiates an endogenous cascade of adaptive biological signaling and hormetic systemic adaptations. The literatureto date already shows that homeopathic medicines do modulate macrophage activation patterns. 149,150 As a result, an area worthy of future study is the nature of the protein coronas for people with different homeopathic constitutional types or acute health conditions at baseline and over the course of treatment. This type of emergentbiological identity from protein coronas potentially distin- guishes potentization-induced nano-structures from identi-ty of conventional drugs or even non-homeopathic nano- structures from outside the body. In homeopathy, oneinvestigator recently proposed using an individual 's own homeopathically prepared DNA (which is inherently nano-scale), in their unique currentepigenetic stateof gene expression isopathically to treat miasmatic dis- eases. 151Separately, mainstream nano-medicine researchers are already beginning to consider the therapeutic potential ofdifferent personalized protein corona coatings on quantita- tively higher dose nano-structures. 135,136,143 For most clinical scenarios, however, the simillimum for the patient 's current state would still be the single correctly chosen homeopathic medicine whose information reso- nates with and literally adsorbs onto its surface the mostrelevant pattern of endogenous proteins re flecting the patient 's current state: that is, the biological information pattern of the recipient individual in the protein corona. 152 The clinically claimed need in homeopathy for even more precise symptom pattern matching to choose the correct homeopathic medicine at higher versus lower potenciesmay derive in part from differences in potency-related nanoparticle sizes and consequently the resultant protein corona patterns that form. 18 To a limited extent, particle sizes and zeta potential values, which assess electrical potential around nanopar- ticles, provide some indication of nano-structure stability Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 2/2020Complexity of Homeopathic Healing Response \u2014Part 2 Bell 56 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Applying newer nano-technology for examining the protein corona at the nano-biointerface, such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, may be necessary in studying homeopathic healing. 17,135,136,143 Once the simillimum homeopathic signal interfaces and acquires its personalized biological identity from the recipi- ent's own body, the endogenous biological signaling networks of the body can take over (see also Part 1 of this paper). Cell biology naturally involves molecular mediators of the cell danger response system as well as structures and cascadesof signaling processes at the nano-sized level of scale 153 -157 (e.g., DNAdoublehelixis 2 nm in diameter; 10 nm thick \u2014https://www.news-medical.net/ life-sciences/Nanoscience-Advances-in-Biology.aspx). Nano-scale signaling for systemic cellular messengers,158including cell membrane-derived intraluminal nano-vesicles (exosomes, ranging from 30 to nm in size),156as well as damage/danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and associated immune cellsand mediators. 158 Consider for example the homeopathic ,161,162prepared from breast cancer tissue. Carci- nosin potencies can induce breast cancer cell death.161,163 Most likely, Carcinosin in potency contains low quantities of cancer cell exosomes and/or genetic material informationexpressing the biology of cancer after undergoing the agitation of succussions. In mainstream nano-medicine, researchers are now test- ing breast cancer exosomes \u2014that is, nano-sized extracellular vesicles formed from breast cancer cells \u2014in vaccines to prevent and/or treat breast cancer.157,164Homeopaths have been using Carcinosin for patients with a much broader clinical picture, in addition to breast cancer per se, for a muchlonger period of time. Apart from malignancy, other, non- cancerous, cells normally use exosomes for intercellular communication via the plasma. 156,165 Environmental stressors and danger signals (from the internal and/or external environment) can arrive in the form of chemical bulk-form agents, nano-structuredagents, 158electromagnetic and/or optical (photon) informa- tion,166,167altitude, other factors such as cold or hot temperatures,168or endogenous damage-related cell to cell messengers (e.g., hormones, cytokines, exosomes [nano- sized vesicles carrying DNA, RNA, and proteins from their original biological cell], cell signaling pathways).169Howev- er, it is the quantitatively low dose of the self-similar homeopathic medicine in potency that can best trigger hormesis and personalized biological healing, rather thansuppress symptoms of the disease in a sick individual. 170 Summary and Discussion The fundamental description of homeopathic healing readilytranslates into the modern scienti c terms from the eld of Fig. 2 Comparing the intensity of different [protein] bands for two plasma coronas from silica nanoparticles.

The working hypothesis here is that the correct homeopathic medicine triggers thebody as a complex adaptive system (an open system far from thermodynamic equilibrium) to self-re-organize system- wide toward better health. 146,170,171The biology of the body itself occurs at the nano-scale level of organization172 using adaptive non-linear dynamical change as an essentialfeature in restoring and maintaining health. 171,173,174Heal- ing is an emergent biological process. Homeopathic medicines exhibit features of complex systems, especially self-similarity and self-organization, asshown in previously published studies of both water and plant exudates. The emergent properties of homeopathic medicines include the capacity for generating unique elec-tromagnetic and optical emissions. Self-organization is also a key characteristic of recipient living systems (that is, CAS). Whatever the nature of homeo-pathic medicines, 175the net clinical result is improved bio- psychosocial resilience of the biological organism as a whole.145,171,176The healing process engages the capacity for biological self-organization inherent in CAS to reverse disease processes.4,177Moreover, the healing process is non-linear, in that the weak signal of the correct simillimum medicineinitiates a disproportionately large response in the body. The signal from the correct homeopathic medicine reflects resonance between the emergent information car- ried by the potency as a complex system 22,178and the emergent electromagnetic and biochemical properties of the recipient organism as a complex adaptive systemreflected in adsorbed protein patterns from the individual 's blood plasma or serum 17(Fig. 1 ).22-24,178 -180In addition to surface electrical charge and smoothness or roughness, thesize, shape, and hydrophobicity of the nano-structures affect the quantity and af nities of blood proteins that adsorb onto the nano-structure surfaces to make the personalized pro- tein corona coats. 181 The current model then suggests that quantitatively low doses of the various nano-structure -protein com- plexes generate the individually salient and low-intensity signal that serves as the hormetic stimulus (personalizedhormetin). During homeopathic treatment of human beings or animals, the body takes over the process in two ways: (i) adsorbing unique patterns of biomolecules (e.g., pro- teins) that re flect the current emergent disease state of the organism on to the homeopathic medicine nano-structure surfaces to create the protein corona coat and thus generate a personalized biological identity for the patient 's body. The result would enhance speci c treat- ment salience for the individual 's current state; (ii) modulating the biology of symptoms and healing via functional changes in neural, immune, and in flammato- ry pathway networks and mediators 149,160,182 -185:f o r example, interactive components of the cell danger/ damage molecular pattern response system.158,170A feature of the biological response is modulation of complex gene expression patterns by speci c medicines.150,186 -188These adaptations are all in the service of optimizing the individual 'stness to survive in a biologically perceived environment that includes the potential disease damage or disease-encapsulated \"danger \"of the homeopathic medi- cine, as signaled by detection of the low-dose homeopathicinformation (that is, an individualized integrated form of the current disease state of the person). The implication is that using the homeopathic simillimum medicine as a personalized hormetin will modulate the inter- relationships and interactions of endogenous biological signal- ing networks to initiate disease recovery, a hypothesis sup- ported by studies of certain homeopathic medicines in animal or cellular models for cancer. 189 -193 If the system is already diseased in some way, it is at or close to its physiological limits (cf. time-dependent sensiti- zation and oscillation).194,195The body will potentially exhibit transient aggravation up to its physiological limitsand then reverse its direction of change back from disease toward a healthier degree of complexity, following the arrival of a quantitatively low-dose, hormetic salient stimulus to doso. 196,197 As a quantitatively low-dose warning signal to adapt,11,190 the homeopathic medicine does not require a conventionalpharmaceutical-level dose or quantity, be it some type of nano-structure, 19-21,31,32,34 -37,39,83,84,90,107,185an electro- magnetic and/or optical signal 8,25,26,76,87,97,198and/or some other physical- chemistry phenomenon.98-100 This present complexity-based model requires the nano- biointerface between the individual patient 's current bio- logical condition and the simillimum nano-medicine prop- erties. The clinical state-dependent individual proteincorona forms a unique biological identity for the medicine nano-structures to ful l their simillimum role, on contact with the patient 's own blood plasma, serum, and/or saliva. Hormesis evolves as an adaptive pattern of endogenous responses to the homeopathic information/signal. It follows from the model that effective homeopathic treatment requires not only (1) quantitatively low doses of uniquenano-structures salient to the current state of the recipient patient; but also (2) an interaction at the nano-biointerface between the medicine nano-structure surfaces and thepatient 's own blood plasma or serum proteins to form the personalized protein corona as the hormetic signal; and (3) subsequent adaptive evolution of better health viainteractive self-reorganization of the organism 's non-linear dynamical networks and sub-systems across multiple levels of scale (see Part 1). Finally, research questions for testing this model include: \u0081Does the homeopathic simillimum medicine, but not a clinically incorrect medicine or a placebo, emit uniquehomeopathic signal information that attracts a highly representative, patient state-speci c pattern of plasma protein adsorption on to the nano-structure surfaces? \u0081Does the complex medicine system, on interface with the body as a complex adaptive system, thereby create a low quantitative dose, personalized hormetic signal Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 2/2020Complexity of Homeopathic Healing Response \u2014Part 2 Bell 58 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. encapsulating the individual 's current disease state (pro- tein corona adsorption pattern) to initiate the adaptive changes of healing? \u0081Do higher versus lower homeopathic potencies of the same medicine exhibit different physico-chemical and/orbiological properties at the nano-scale level of organiza- tion: for example, different nano-structure sizes and shapes, surface charges, protein corona adsorption pat-terns, durations of action? \u0081To what extent mechanisms of endoge- nous signal ampli cation processes, such as stochastic resonance, hormesis, and time-dependent sensitization (see Part 1), play a role in the nature, direction, and magnitude of clinical responses to homeopathic similli-mum treatment? \u0081Do the biological networks involved in simillimum responses include reactive oxygen species, DAMPs, includ-ing but not limited to heat shock proteins, exosomes, and specic components of the immune system such as macro- phages as part of the endogenous signaling process? This complexity model for homeopathic medicine also requires adopting nano-materials research technologies andmethods that can objectively document existence of \u2014and manufacturing materials and methods-related variations in \u2014the complexity of homeopathic medicine-derived signals, protein corona formation, and biological effects. Conclusions In conclusion, the evidence suggests that every homeo-pathic medicine is a complex nano-scale system involvingmultiple inter-connected, interacting components (core- shell nano-structures of source, silica/silicon or carbon, modi ed by lactose and/or ethanol -water solvent), and emergent electromagnetic, opto-electronic, quantum, and biological properties. Homeopathic nano-structure sizes may vary as a function of trituration and subsequent succussions, surface electrical and adsorptive properties, shells formed from lactose, silica,and/or other materials in solution (e.g., made from plant source extracts, or from cork extract if containers are stoppered with natural cork), and animal source materials.The smallest nano-structures, for example, source, silicon, or carbon quantum dots, may or may not be detectable in a given study because of limitations in methodologicalapproaches or in technological instrumentation tools (e.g., lower limits for assays of trace amounts of elements with specialized mass spectroscopy or lower limits for very smallparticle size detection [e.g., quantum dots] with nanoparticle tracking analysis instruments). In this adaptive network nano-medicine model, 146,170 speci c biological individualization would derive from the formation of a unique personalized protein corona layer that instantly adsorbs on to the reactive surface of the homeo-pathic simillimum nano-structures on contact with a patient 's own blood plasma, serum, or saliva. The protein components of the patient 'sb i o l o g i c a l fluids re flect thecurrent biological state of the patient as re flected in the self-similar symptom pattern exhibited across the self-organized complex adaptive system of the body. Further- more, the smaller nanoparticle sizes found at higher homeo- pathic potencies 92may play a role in variations in the protein corona patterns formed on contact with biological fluids and their subsequent physiological effects18: for example, longer duration of action.144 These quantitatively low doses of such complex nano- structures in homeopathic potencies initiate the endogenous adaptive processes of hormesis and related phenomena tomobilize reversal of disease manifestations (see Part 1). The capacity for self-organization, structural and functional self- similarity, and emergence in complex systems, is the key todesigning future research on not only the nature of homeo- pathic medicines, but also emergent systemic healing during individualized homeopathic treatment. The previously pro-posed term of \"adaptive network nanomedicine \" 146,170for the present model encompasses the existing data and suggests a research path forward. Highlights \u0081Evidence suggests that each homeopathic medicine is a complex multi-component, core-shell and/or doped nano-structured system ranging in sizes from 1 to 100 nm in diameter and exhibiting properties of self-organization, self-similarity, and emergence. \u0081The nano-scale components of homeopathic medicine 's core and shell include source materials, silica and siliconquantum dots (if manufactured in glassware and/or plant-source materials), carbon nano-structures including carbonquantum dots(ifmanufactured inplasticcontainers and/or containing any organic materials from source, lactose, or ethanol), and water nano-structures. \u0081The homeopathic simillimum nano-structures emit unique electromagnetic and opto-electronic signals as well as exhibit quantum mechanical properties. \u0081On contact with a speci c patient 's plasma or serum, the current model proposes that the homeopathic nano- structures adsorb clinical state-speci c patterns of pro- teins and other biomolecules on to their surfaces, there- by creating a personalized protein corona coat and biological identity re flective of the patient 'sc u r r e n t biological state (e.g., health versus speci c disease or clinical state). \u0081Homeopathic simillimum as an individualized treatment would derive, at the nano-biointerface from the interac- tion of the emergent signal, properties of the correctly matched medicine and the individual patient 'so w n unique biological state (protein corona state-speci c pattern) at quantitatively low -that is, hormetic -doses. Smaller nanoparticle sizes in higher versus lower poten-cies may also affect the speci c protein corona patterns and thus biological effects. \u0081Hormetic doses of the individual 's encapsulated illness biology on the simillimum 's nano-structure surface protein corona coat/layer would serve as adaptive trig- gers for homeopathic healing from disease.
