Introduction Montefiore Health System is a premier academic health system and the University Hospital for Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Combining a nationally -recognized clinical excellence with a population health perspective that focuses on the health needs of c ommunities, Montefiore delivers coordinated, compassionate, science -driven care where, when and how patients need it most. Montefiore consists of six hospitals and an extended care facility with a total of 2,080 beds, a School of Nursing, and state -of-the-art primary and specialty care provided through a network of more than 150 locations across the region, including the largest school health program in the nation and a home health program. Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital is a 2 42-bed, community -based tea ching hospital offering primary, acute and emergency care t o the residents of southern Westchester. Since its founding in 1892, Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital has provided for the diverse medical needs of the community and region it serves. The Hospital is part of Montefiore Health System, a premier academic medical center and the University Hospital System for Albert Einstein College of Medicine. As of November 6, 2013, as a part of the Montefiore Health System, a premier academic medical center and the University Hospital system for Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital continues to provide inpatient, critical care and ambulatory services. Montefiore New Rochelle has a number of leading -edge services and programs that have earned distinction by state and national organizations for achieving and maintaining the highest quality of care within the specialty , including: Designated as a Center of Excellence by the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery New York St ate-designated Stroke Center New York State -designated Area Trauma Center \u2014the only one in southern Westcheste r New York State -designated perinatal hospital with a Level 3 Neonatal Intensive Care Unit that provides state -of-the-art care for fragile newborns Gold Seal of Approval from The Joint Commission as a certified Center of Excellence in both hip and knee joint replacement 4 1a. Montefiore's Mission Statement and Strategy : Montefiore's Mission Statement and Strategy : In January 2009, Montefiore Me dical Center completed a comprehensive review and update of its strategic plan. The process included the development and approval by its Board of Trustees of revised statements of the medical center's Mission, Vision and Values. Mission: To Heal, to Tea ch, to Discover and to Advance the Health of the Communities We Serve. Vision: To be a premier academic medical center that transforms health and enriches lives . Values: Humanity, Innovation, Teamwork, Diversity and Equity As part of that process, Mo ntefiore established five Strategic Goals; setting out Montefiore's course for the decade to come: 1. Advance our partnership with the Einstein College of Medicine 2. Create notable Centers of Excellence 3. Build specialty care broadly 4. Develop a seamless deliver y system with superior access, quality, safety and patient satisfaction 5. Maximize the impact of our community service The inclusion of an explicit statement affirming Community Service as part of Montefiore's Mission Statement is not new. It has always b een one of the core elements of Montefiore's mission. What has changed is the explicit reference to \"advancing the health of the communities we serve\", focusing on making a measurable difference in the health of those populations and communities. This is further sharpened by the inclusion as one of the five strategic goals the imperative, to \"maximize the impact of our community service.\" 5 In pursuing that goal, Montefiore has tasked itself: To better coordinate and focus its resources on specific high pr evalence/high impact problems affecting its community; To work internally and with community partners to identify priority health needs, and; To develop and implement more effective broad -based plans of action to address them, and to advance the health of the communities we serve. The rationale behind this change was the realization that we must focus our efforts, if we are to make a real, measurable difference in the health of populations, and communities. That is essentially the same logic as underpi ns the state's revised Community Service Plan process. Historically, Montefiore has earned a reputation as a leader in the region, state and nation in providing services to its community, by developing and operating an extraordinary array of needed servic es to the poor and underserved, and to specific at -risk populations (eg. children, the elderly, the HIV -infected, the homeless and victims of domestic violence). In its updated Strategy, Montefiore included a strategic goal - \"Maximize the impact of our community service\" - that is focused on improving performance in this critical area. It has led to the creation of a new institutional focus for community health improvement activities - the Montefiore Office of Community and Population Health, charged to oversee, and support and coordinate Montefiore's diverse portfolio of community health improvement programs and activities, enhance Montefiore's capacity to assess and measure the health needs of the communities it serves, identify, assess and select a limited number of top -priority health needs in the communities Montefiore serves for specific focus, and lead and coordinate Montefiore -wide efforts, and, where possible working, together and with community partners to make a difference, to measurably improve the health of the communities we serve. 6 2b. Community Health Needs Assessment Submission Date Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital's comprehensive Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Strategy Report submission was approved by the Com munity Services Committee of the Board of Trustees on November 4, 2014. The Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Report (CHNA & I) report was uploaded to the Montefiore website December 2014 at the URL http://www.montefiore.org/documents/communityservices/2014 -CHNA1 -NR-with-CSS- Inventory.pdf . III. Definition Area Montefiore New Rochelle Hosp ital has identified the city of New Rochelle and its surrounding towns and villages as its primary service area. Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital is the only hospital in the City of New Rochelle , which is a south eastern city in Westchester County bordere d to its east by the Long Island Sound, on the west by Pelham , Pelham Manor and Eastchester , by Scarsdale to the north and east, Mamaroneck and Larchmont to the east. The city lies 2 miles (3.2 km) north of the New York City border ( Pelham Bay Park in The Bronx ). It is the seventh largest city in New York State. According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 13.2 square miles (34.3 km2). The city has a rough triangle shape, approximately 10 miles (16 km) from north to south and 1.5 miles (2 km) from east to west at its widest point The communities served by the M NRH are extremely diverse. The service area contains pockets of prosperity, where health insurance coverage is more prominent, along with many economically challenged n eighborhoods whose residents are uninsured or underinsured. Most of the latter do not access healthcare routinely but rather present only in crisis thro ugh the Emergency Department. New Rochelle is a diverse urban setting, with multiple sub -population s that evidence tremendous variation. In addition to Montefiore New Rochelle , the community is served by many independent providers including neighboring hospitals/systems, and a Federally Qualified Health Center, which has an overlapping service area. In this setting, the focus is on specific health needs of specific populations, in targeted communities, working with specific partners to address the needs of this community. The ability to apply services in a targeted fashion has been Montefiore's historica l approach to developing and operating its programs of community health, and that is the approach we have taken in developing this Community Service Plan. 7 New Rochelle Service Area 8 3a. Population of New Rochelle According to the 2013 American Communi ty Survey of the U.S. Census, New Rochelle has approximately 78,400 residents. There are approximately 28,000 households in New Rochelle . The average household size is 2.71 people . Families made up 68% of the households; includes both married -couple famili es and families (28.1% male, 13.2% female). Nonfamily households consist of 32% of all households in New Rochelle; includes people living alone and non -related people living under one household. 32.8% of households inc lude one or more people under 18 years of age. 29.6% of households include one or more people 60 years of age or older. New Rochelle is ethnically diverse. Its population is 28.5% Hispanic , 17.8% African -American, 69.6% White, Almo st one -third ( 26.3%) of its residents are foreign - born. Among these immigrants, more people speak only English at home than any other language. The city's immigrant communities come from diverse corners of the globe (in order of their numbers): Mexico, Col ombia, Italy, Jamaica, Guatemala, Peru, Haiti, Brazil, China, and Portugal. New Rochelle is one of Westchester County's more affluent cities. Reflecting 2013 data from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey, 1% of New Rochelle households are on public assistance; less than the Westchester County (2.2%) and New York State (3.4%) percentages.10.4% of New Rochelle's population lives below the poverty line and the median income is $66,656 (compared to $77,293 countywide). There are 12.2% of New Roch elle children living below poverty . The unemployment rate in New Rochelle is 7.5%; less than the countywide (8.4%) and statewide (9.2%) rates. 82.3 % of New Rochelle residents ages 25 and older have received t heir high school diploma or GED; lower than both the countywide rate of 87..4 and lower than the statewide rate of 85.6%. 3b. Health Status of the City of New Rochelle The health status of the city of New Rochelle was measured across the indicators of overall health status as well as indicators of t he social, environmental, and economic determinants of health. While there are areas of improvement, New Rochelle 's rates are comparable to the midline , when compared to the remainder of Westchester County. The residents in New Rochelle have significan tly high mortality rates from heart disease, cancer, stroke, and chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRD). 9 Mortality Rates : According to the New York State Department of Health's (NYSDOH) Vital Statistics of New York State report in 2011, Westchester Cou nty (which includes the city of New Rochelle ) has an age -adjusted mortality rate of 713.4 per 100,000; similar to the statewide rate of 753.1. According to the Community Health Rankings in 2014, Westchester County ranked as number 3 out of 62 NY counties t o have the low est mortality rate in New York S tate. The leading cause of death among Westchester County residents is due to coronary heart disease (219.7 per 100,000). Asthma & CLRD : According to the NYSDOH, 8.7% of Westchester County adults had asthma fr om 2008 - 2009; lower than the statewide percentage of 9.7%. According to CDC data, the percentage of Westchester County adults with asthma increased to 14% from 2011 -2012; same percentage as New York State. According to an asthma report from New York Stat e Office of the State Comptroller, the asthma prevalence rate among Westchester County Medicaid recipients was 86.7 per 1,000 from 2008 -2009. The prevalence rate increased to 98.4 per 1,000 from 2012 -2013; similar to the statewide prevalence rate of 98.7. The average (age -adjusted) rate of asthma emergency department visits per 10,000 from 2011 was 64.2 in Westchester County. In 2012, the rate of asthma emergency department visits increased to 67.4 per 10,000. In 2010, t he age -adjusted death rate due to chronic lower respiratory diseases among Westchester County residents was 24.3 per 100,000; lower than the statewide rate of 31.1. In 2011, Westchester County's death rate decreased to 23.4; remaining lower t han the statewide rate of 31.2. Heart Disease & Stroke : The coronary heart disease mortality rate per 100,000 in Westchester County was 119.5 in 2011; similar to the 2010 rate of 117.1. The coronary heart disease hospitalization rate per 10,000 in Westchester County was 35.8 in 2011; similar to the 20 10 rate of 36.4. 10 The cerebrovascular disease (stroke) mortality rate per 100,000 in Westchester County was 25.8 in 2011; an increase from the 2010 rate of 24.0. The stroke hospitalization rate per 10,000 in Westchester County from 2009 -2011 was 22.8; simi lar to the statewide rate of 24.9. The cardiovascular disease mortality rate per 100,000 in Westchester County was 199.2 in 2011; an increase from the 2010 rate of 195.5. The cardiovascular disease hospitalization rate per 10,000 in Westchester County was 133.1; similar to the 2010 rate of 135.9. Cancer : The mortality rate of all cancer diagnoses in Westchester County was 150.5 in 2010; similar to the statewide rate of 160.2. The type of cancer with the highest mortality rate in Westchester County is lun g cancer (36.9 per 100,000; lower than the statewide rate of 41.8). The incidence rate of all cancer diagnoses in Westchester County was 495.2 per 100,000 in 2010; similar to the statewide rate of 482.5. The type of cancer with the highest incidence rate in Westchester County is prostate cancer (22.6 per 100,000; similar to the statewide rate of 21.3). Medically Underserved Community Despite these challenges, t he City of New Rochelle is not considered an underserved community, however the evidence of sign ificant health disparity related to heart disease indicates that there is an unmet need in the population. The categorization for a medically underserved population is based on an index value that includes the infant mortality rate, the poverty rate, the percentage of elderly population and the primary care physician to population ratio. While the city of New Rochelle does not qualify, the nearby city of Port Chester and others along the Sound Shore, when coupled with the emerging non English speaking immi grant and migrant populations, an increased need for primary care services is becoming evident. 4. Assessment of Community Health Need 4a. Description of Process and Methods Multiple conversations and meetings were convened internally and with externa l partners, including a thorough review of the data, which determined the activities that would be the focus over the CHNA implementation period. In this Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Report, the documentation of organizations and p artners documents those individuals, groups and organizations with whom implementation activities were planned are detailed in the appendices. 11 Additionally, through the development of the New York State Community Service Plan Process, two local health pri orities were identified within Westchester County on which all hospital organizations had agreed to participate. As the asset acquisition of Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital occurred after the development and release of the Westchester County Community Health Assessment and Improvement Plan and during a time of transition for the facility, its personnel and the community, the development of a relevant, recognized, and trusted community information solicitation process was paramount to gaining the support an d trust necessary to successfully implement any identified health priorities to be implemented in the community. In January 2013, the Westchester Department of Health Commissioner initiated a series of meeting with the acute care, specialty care and fede rally qualified health centers in the county to form a planning team to collectively identify two local health priorities, with at least one addressing a health disparity in support of the New York State Health Improvement Plan. Members of the pre -existin g hospital entities prior to the development of Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital were present, and are still employed by M NRH to provide continuity to this process. Through this process, t wo New York State priority areas were chosen, beyond the process i dentified in the CHNA as priorities to be addressed in i mproving the community's health . Those are: to Prevent Chronic Disease; and to Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children. 4.a.i Data Sources Multiple data sources were used to support the iden tification and selection of the priority items, which were identified, selected, and reviewed with partners. A listing and brief summary of the data sources used to complete the secondary data analysis that were used to identify the issues of concern beyo nd experience and direct observation are listed below. i.

New York State Department of Health Annual HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report viii. American Communit y Survey For this data collection process for New Rochelle , when City of New Rochelle data was not available, a c ustom area estimate for New Rochelle for the specific indicator was generated using population weighted allocations. These estimates are aggr egates of each county which falls within the custom area, based on the proportion of the population from the county which also falls in the area. Population proportions are determined for each county using 2010 census block centroids. This is accomplished by dividing the summed population of the census blocks (associated with each county) which fall within the custom area by the total population of each county that intersects the custom area. In this way, when a custom area contains 50% of the area of a cou nty, but contains 90% of its population, the figure for that county is weighted at 90% in 12 the custom area tabulation. This approach assumes spatial uniformity of the reported figure throughout the county. The base geography for these calculations is the co unty. American Community Survey (ACS) \u2014 Developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, the ACS is an ongoing survey that collects annual data on the major characteristics of communities throughout the U.S. The data collected is categorized into four categories: so cial, economic, demographic, and housing. Social characteristics include topics such as education, disability status, and health insurance status. Economic characteristics describe the income, employment status, and poverty level of U.S. communities. Demog raphic characteristics include age, sex, and race/ethnicity information. Housing characteristics include topics such as occupancy and vacancy, monthly rent, and household size. Approximately 3.5 million U.S households are randomly selected to participate i n the ACS each year. The 201 3 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Questionnaires, datasets, survey results, documentation and more detailed information are available at https://w ww.census.gov/acs/www/ . Community Health Needs Assessment \u2014 This project was developed by the Advancing the Movement organization and the Center for Applied Research and Environmental Systems (CARES) as a web -based toolkit designed to hospitals, state an d local health departments, and other organizations seeking to better understand the needs and assets of their communities . County -level data retrieved from institutions such as the CDC, U.S. Census Bureau, and the Public Health Institute are formulated in to customized data reports. The Full Health Indicators Report illustrates the health needs assessment profiles of U.S. counties using local demographics, socioeconomic factors, physical environment data, clinical care data, health behavior factors, and hea lth outcomes . The 2012 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Detailed information on the Community Health Needs Assessment can be found at CHNA.org . County He alth Rankings \u2014 This project is a collaboration between the Robert Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. Additional data measures used in the rankings were provided by surveys and databases from other organizations such as the National Center for Health Statistics, CDC, Dartmouth Institute, U.S. Census Bureau, and U.S. Department of Agriculture. This database generates health rankings of every U.S. county and illustrates the correlations between local health outcome s, health factors, and socioeconomic factors. The county rankings are based on summary scores calculated from individual data measures. The overall Health Outcomes summary score consists of data on the county's mortality and morbidity. The overall Health F actors summary score consists of data on the county's health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and physical environment. The 201 2 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Detailed information on the County Health Rankings can be found at http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/our -approach . 13 NYS Community Health Indicator Reports \u2014 Reports were provided by the New York State Cancer Registry and the B ehavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The NYS Cancer Registry was established in 1976 to track statewide data of all patients diagnosed with cancer. Data collected from this registry include exposure risks, stages at diagnosis, treatment infor mation, and death rates. Each time a person is diagnosed with a tumor, the hospital(s) where that person is diagnosed and/or treated is required by the Public Health Law Section 2401 to report information about the person and tumor to the Cancer Registry w ithin six months of patient diagnosis. The most recent year for which data on new cases and cancer deaths are available is 2011. Detailed information on the NYS Cancer Registry can be found at http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/cancer/registry/ . The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual statewide telephone surveillance system designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). BRFSS monitors modifia ble risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population. New York State's BRFSS sample represents the non -institutionalized adult household population, aged 18 years and older. The survey is cond ucted in all 50 states and U.S. territories. New York State has participated annually since 1985. Statewide representative samples are collected monthly and aggregated into yearly datasets. The 2011 data is the latest Westchester County -specific BRFSS data illustrated by the NYSDOH. Questionnaires, datasets, survey results, documentation and much more are all available at http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/ . New York State Department of Health's (NYSDOH) Westchester County Indicators for Tracking Public Health Priority Areas 2013 -2017 \u2014 Findings are provided by various agencies such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the Center for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), and NYSDOH programs . Detailed information provided by these agenci es describe each U.S. community's entire population, including cross -tabulations of age, sex, households, families, relationship to householder, housing units, and race/ethnic groups. This NYSDOH report also includes statewide & county -specific data and th e 2017 targets for numerous indicators for the five major prevention agenda areas: preventing chronic diseases; promote a healthy and safe environment; promoting healthy women, infants and children; promote mental health and prevent substance abuse; and, p revent HIV/STDs, vaccine - preventable disease and health care -associated infections. The 201 2 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Detailed information on the NYSDOH Public Health Priority Areas report can be found at http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/prevention_agenda/2013 - 2017/about.htm . The Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) \u2014 This comprehensive database was e stablished in 1979 as a result of cooperation between the health care industry and government. SPARCS collects patient level data on hospital discharges, patient characteristics, diagnoses and treatments, and health care services. This database system also collects data on charges for every hospital discharge, ambulatory surgery patient, and emergency department admission in New York State. This database features the World Health Organization's Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD -9), an official set of codes used by physicians, hospitals, and allied health workers to indicate diagnosis for all 14 patient encounters. The 2013 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicai d's DRG (Diagnosis -Related Groups) coding system is also featured in the SPARCS data. DRGs group patients by diagnosis, treatment, age, and other characteristics. Hospitals are paid a set fee for treating patients in a single DRG category. Detailed informa tion on the SPARCS data can be found at http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/sparcs/ . Westchester County Community Health Assessment & Improvement Plan 2014 -2017 \u2014 The Westchester County Departmen t of Health (WCDOH) plays a leading role in promoting health, preventing disease, and prolonging meaningful life for Westchester County residents. WCDH monitors and controls the spread of communicable diseases, monitors and regulates air and water quality, enforces the state and local sanitary co de, promotes local public health activities, and assures the availability of community health services. CDH has collaborated with local hospitals and other community health partners to complete a Community Health Assessment (CHA), which describes the current health status of Westchest er County residents, identifies existing gaps and health care barriers, assesses the availability and accessibility of health care services, and specifies public health prioritie s in the County. In addition, a Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) has been crafted to lay out the specific objectives, goals, and actions of t he Health Department to address the public health priorit ies identified in the Community He alth Assessment. Detaile d information on this report can be found at http://health.westchestergov.com/statistics . 4.a.ii Collaboration and Participants As the Community Health Needs Assessment was being developed, two simultaneous processes were evolving. First, Montefiore was charged with the development of its New York State Community Service Plan submission for the period of 2015 -2017 for the New York State Health Department's Prevention Agenda. For this process, priorities were identified within Westchester County on which all hospital organizations had agreed to participate. As the asset acquisition of Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital occurred after the development and release of the Westchester County Community H ealth Assessment and Improvement Plan and during a time of transition for the facility, its personnel and the community, the development of a relevant, recognized, and trusted community information solicitation process was paramount to gaining the support and trust necessary to successfully implement any identified health priorities to be implemented in the community. In January 2013, the Westchester Department of Health Commissioner initiated a series of meeting with the acute care, specialty care and fed erally qualified health centers in the county to form a planning team to collectively identify two local health priorities, with at least one addressing a health disparity in support of the New York State Health Improvement Plan. Members of the pre -existi ng hospital entities prior to the development of Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital were present, and are still employed by M NRH to provide continuity to this process. Through this process, t wo New York State priority areas were chosen, beyond the process identified in the CHNA as priorities to be addressed in improving the community's 15 health . Those are: to Prevent Chronic Disease; and to Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children. Second, through the Montefiore Health System's successful application to submit as an Emerging Performing Provider System (PPS) as a part of the New York State Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment Program Application process, the decision was made to collaborate with the Hudson Valley region's other four PPS organization s to complete one comprehensive Community Needs Assessment, resulting in the \"One Region, One CNA\" process. With these three similar activities occurring simultaneously, a streamlined set of data collection tools and methods were developed to gather infor mation to inform the CAN process. 4.a.ii.1 Partners/Organizations 4.a.ii.1.a Partners/Organizations As indicated in Section 4a, the partners listed in this section comprise the individuals, groups and organizations that are participating in the focused Implementation Plan activities that evolve out of the CHNA process. As the CHNA process was conducted simultaneously with the New York State Community Service Plan (CSP) development, there is strong alignment between the areas of focus in this report and the areas presented in the CSP. In Section 7, it is clearly documented that Montefiore will continue to work on the over 85 existing program initiatives, as each of those initiatives have partners, metrics, and meeting schedules. The Montefiore Health System has significant experience in working with community advisory groups and boards. During the process of initiating the relationship with the New Rochelle community and its surrounding villages , the community group platform through the former Specia l Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) program now a part of Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital, was utilized as a method of gathering input from key community stakeholders on the health of the community. As the asset acquis ition of Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital occurred after the development and release of the Westchester County Community Health Assessment and Improvement Plan and during a time of transition for the facility, its personnel and the community, the developme nt of a relevant, recognized, and trusted community information solicitation process was paramount to gaining the support and trust necessary to successfully implement any identified health priorities to be implemented in the community. The Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital WIC Community Advisory Group ( WIC CAG) met for this purpose. This key stakeholder group was made of consumer participants as well as a selct number of members f rom civic, municipal and non -governmental service providers, leaders in the business and faith communities and non -affiliated community residents. To level set the discussions, the community advisory group participated in an extensive data review session examining over 400 data categories specifically related to the indicators of overall health status as well as indicators of the social, environmental, and economic determinants of health. After significant distillation, the community group assisted in the review and prioritization of the health needs of this community, as well as the identification of key topics to be included in the comprehensive 16 Community Needs Assessment that was d eveloped in Fall 2014. This community level approach involving relevant stakeholders that in the targeted community who are interested in the particu lar health issues being addressed provides for a closer alignment between the community level goals of Montefiore and the health promotion/ improvement/ maintenance goals of the community. Furthermore, Montefiore met with the Deputy Commissioner, Dr. Cher yl Archibald, and her team to gain a greater understanding of the process for the county in selecting the health priorities. The inter -organizational committee that was developed to address the identification of these heath needs consisted of the followin g membership: Westchester County Health Planning Team Members Organization Name Title Blythedale Children's Hospital Lena Cavanna Director, Community & Media Relations Regina M.

Identification of Community Health Needs The process to identify the needs of the community involved the collection of secondary and primary data. Examining a variety of factors, the following series of indicators, identified with rate, source, and comparis on to New York State and national data (when available) is provided. The primary and secondary data collection process illuminated multiple categories of health needs that were both important across the populations surveyed and reflected in the data as critical. The two being targeted over this implementation are: 1. Prevention of Chronic Disease, specifically the reduction of racial and ethnic disparities leading to premature death due to cardiovascular disease, and 2. Promotion of Hea lthy Women Infants an d Children , specifically through increasing the proportion of infants that are breastfed. Due to the broad sco pe of programs provided across the Montefiore Health System, multiple needs were identified beyond the planned focused activity of the Community Service Plan, and will be addressed through the ongoing programs across the delivery system.

Measures and Resources to Meet Ide ntified Needs Montefiore is a leader in community health and has a long history of developing innovative approaches to care and tailoring programs to best serve the changing needs of its community. These include, but are not limited to the following: Commu nity Service Plan, Community Services Strategy, Accountable Care Organization, Patient -Centered Medical Home, Disease Management Programs, and Community Outreach. The integration of these innovative approaches serves Montefiore well in its services to it s community. Montefiore has a vast portfolio of programs and services that address a majority of the significant community health needs identified in the Community Health Needs Assessment. The breadth and depth of the programs and services vary, but each address a need identified in the community. Historically, Montefiore has earned a reputation as a leader in the region, state and nation in providing services to its community, by developing and operating an extraordinary array of needed services to the poor and underserved, and to specific at -risk populations (e.g., children, the elderly, the HIV -infected, the homeless and victims of domestic violence). Beyond its involvement in patient care services to individuals within and (in some cases) beyond its service area, the faculty and staff at Montefiore are heavily invested in the provision of service to the wider Bureau (American Community Survey, 2013) Figure 18b. Means of Commuting to Work by Percent, 2013. Drove Alone Public Transportation Other Percentage 52 the education of health professionals; the generation of new knowledge through basic, clinical and social sciences re search; affecting health policy through service on a range of professional, governmental and inter-institutional boards and advisory group; and by involvement in programs of community service (like housing preservation) which go beyond the boundaries of health and health care. Montefiore embraces its social responsibility and defines its role broadly, promoting wellness in addition to treating disease and addressing needs ranging far beyond medical care. We extend this responsibility to the care of o ur employees and medical staff, many of whom live in the surrounding community. The population Montefiore serves is one of the most diverse in the nation. Montefiore has been an incubator for programs that improve patients' access to culturally appropri ate services, and its progressive financial aid policy and robust entitlement enrollment program support access to care for those in need. Historically, Montefiore has viewed community service and community health improvement as a delivery system challeng e, reaching out to serve the under -resourced. Services to the community are an explicit and essential component of Montefiore's mission and one of its most valued traditions. The medical center has a long history of reaching beyond the walls of its hosp itals to identify and meet the needs of its community and has been a national leader in organizing and expanding community -based services. Our commitment to the community has required a multifaceted, continually evolving response, in which the unique capac ities of the academic medical center are mobilized to improve the lives of the people and the communities we serve -- not just medically, but socially, economically and environmentally, wherever and whenever our resources can make a difference. For much of our history, community service at Montefiore has been a vital grassroots movement. When pressing needs arose that lay beyond the purview of traditional health care, physicians, nurses, social workers, staff and community partners have stepped in to add ress them. These programs tackle a remarkable range of health problems in the Bronx; from the epidemics of diabetes and obesity to high rates of teen pregnancy. They come in an equally impressive range of sizes; from an online guide to hundreds of social services to complex federally -funded agencies with hundreds of staff. With the understanding that the practice of medicine is a service to the community, we have defined community service to include those efforts at preventing disease, enhancing wellbeing and enacting social change that go beyond traditional health care and its fee -for-service reimbursement system. Through this entrepreneurial spirit, over the past one hundred years in the Bronx, Montefiore associates have developed, independently and in collaboration with other organizations, an impressive array of programs that address many of the needs of our communities. In many cases the programs developed in the Bronx have resulted in national changes in best practices and through our relationship a s the University Hospital for the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the programs have the capacity to expand the evidence base to improve the health of communities like ours beyond our borders. 53 6a. Internal Resources and Measures Below is a list of M ontefiore programs that address a variety of community needs, including a brief description, the intervention measures that the program captures and the coordination of the program to the larger New York State Prevention Agenda that is also aligned with th e New York City Take Care New York initiatives.

Women are pre - screened for the program and receive a medica l referral to the WIC program from providers, they qualify based on their income. Once they are screened, they receive counseling with a nutritional counselor. Vouchers are distributed for supermarket purchases on a monthly basis for three months worth of fruits, vegetables, milk, eggs, juice, beans, bread, peanut butter, etc. Counselors encourage breastfeeding for new babies, at six months, new mothers receive vouchers for baby food and cereal. At 12 months, no more formula vouchers are given. Participants see a nutritionist every 3 months and qualification is verified annually. Group education, physical education and food demonstrations are given as well. Montefiore provides space and referrals.

New York State Health Impr ovement Plan - Implementation Plan and Measures As a part of the Montefiore submission for the New York State Health Improvement Plan for 2015 -2017, required by the New York State Department of Health, two broad focus areas across two priority areas - Preventing Chronic Disease and Promoting Healthy Women, Infants and Children, in addition to the large array of services provided by Montefiore were identified. These broad focus areas are (1) Increase Access to High Quality Chronic Disease Preventive Care and Management in Both Clinical and Community Settings , (2) Reducing Illness Disability and Death Related to Tobacco Use and Secondhand Smoke Exposure (3), and (4) Improving Maternal and Infant Health. Across these focus areas, six goals, with specific interventions, performance measures and time frames, were identified, and are described in the next section. Two Year Plan of Action \u20142015 -2017 The two areas selected by Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital (and the corresponding designations in the Preventio n Agenda 2014 -2017: New York State's Health Improvement Plan) for submission in this Community Service Plan are as follows: Under the Priority Area - Prevent Chronic Disease 1. Increase Access to High Quality Chronic Disease Preventive Care and Management i n Both Clinical and Community Settings a. Goal 3.3.1 - Increasing screening rates for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers especially among disparate populations Under the Priority Area - Promote Healthy Women Infants an d Children 2. Maternal and Infant Health a. Goal 2.2.1 - Increase the proportion of infants born in New York State who are exclusively breastfed during the birth hospitalization The plan of action for each focus area is described in the following sections: 101 Prevent Chronic Disease (Heart Disease) Focus Area 3: Increase Access to High Quality Chronic Disease Preventive Care and Management in Both Clinical and Community Settings Goal 3.3.1 - Increasing screening rates for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, breast , cervical, and colorectal cancers especially among disparate populations Strategic Plan: Montefiore has selected to focus on reducing the racial disparities by decreasing the percentage of Blacks and Hispanics dying prematurely from heart related disease s by focusing on reducing tobacco and nicotine consumption among these populations in the Montefiore service area as tobacco and nicotine consumption is a leading causal indicator in heart related disease. The implementation of this focus area will strong ly combine elements of Focus Area 2: Reducing Illness Disability and Death Related to Tobacco Use and Secondhand Smoke Exposure. Specifically, through the specific implementation of Goal 3.3.1 - Increasing screening rates for cardiovascular disease, diab etes, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers especially among disparate populations, focusing specifically on cardiovascular diseases, through the mechanism of: Goal 2.2.2 - Increasing the number of unique callers to the New York State Quit -Line Goal 2.2.2 - Decreasing the prevalence of cigarette smoking by adults ages 18 years and older There is a strong likelihood of positively trending toward the reduction of the racial and ethnic disparity rates in premature death from heart related disease. Strategic Plan: Montefiore has been successful at increasing the number of unique callers to the New York State Quit-Line with our inpatient populations as we have been able to document 100% contacts for 102 patients at discharge with provision of the New York St ate Quit -Line information. In 2012, this covered over 50,000 unique adult, aged over 18 lives. We have also been tremendously successful with the expansion of the smoke free campus to cover all of our locations in addition to our acute care hospitals an d have remained an ardent support of supplemental nicotine replacement therapy in the community as demonstrated by Montefiore's annual distribution of Nicotine Replacement Therapy across the Bronx and the expansion of this practice at Montefiore New Rochel le Hospital. Goals & Objectives: The goal is to increase the rate of unique callers from across our ambulatory populations and within the communities that our ambulatory facilities are located in by enhancing the training of physicians and increasing the quantity and visibility of the education we provide in New Rochelle and the surrounding communities. Evidence Base: The evidence base for the expansion of smoking cessation programs especially using the New York State Tobacco Control program is substantia l. The P OWR Tobacco Cessation Program of the American Lung Association funded through the New York State Tobacco Control Program is Montefiore's partner in this activity. The measures of these activities are constructed within the framework established b y the New York State Department of Health Tobacco Control Program. Performance Measures and Time Frame Targets The performance measures associated with the increasing of unique callers to the quit line and the decreasing of smoking prevalence in adults 1 8 year and older are: Performance Measures (Increasing Unique Callers): Number of callers referred to the quit line as documented in the Electronic Medical Record data Incorporate quit line information on patient discharge information Receive reporting thr ough POWR Tobacco Cessation program of referral of patients through the Fax to Quit program to enhance the number of calls/contacts with the Quitline Performance Measures (Decreasing the smoking prevalence in adults): 103 Increasing the provision of pharmaceut ical Nicotine Replacement Therapy by appropriate clinical staff to individuals who desire to eliminate tobacco use. Increasing the prominence of advertising and traditional and social media messaging to increase the likelihood of appropriate messaging reac hing individuals with appropriate readiness levels to quit smoking Timeframe targets: Montefiore New Roche lle Hospital, as a part of the Montefiore Health System is examining the Opt-to-Quit model as an enterprise wide solution to be implemented by 2017, to further enhance the existing utilization of the Fax -to-Quit hotline. Through the Opt -to-Quit platform, the facility or program establishes a patient opt -out policy that triggers the referral process and links tobacco using patients to the evidence -based services of the New York State Smokers' Quitline. The Quitline accepts referred patient information through one of the secure information exchange options; patients are contacted by the Quitline within 72 hours or as specified by the provider. All patien ts are offered Quitline services at initial contact. The Quitline generates a PAR back to the facility which can be accessed on demand or via electronic or fax delivery. Quitline communications with the patient are continued at 3 -month intervals for up to 12 months. The purpose of the extended contact is to motivate subsequent quit attempts, encourage tobacco using or recently quit patients to use Quitline services, and to offer access to appropriate levels of support. Promote Healthy Women Infants and Chi ldren Focus Area 2 - Maternal and Infant Health Goal 2.2.1 - Increase the proportion of infants born in New York State who are exclusively breastfed during the birth hospitalization Strategic Plan & Goals Montefiore Medical Center has committed to achievin g the goals of the Baby Friendly Hospital initiative and expand this designation as an enterprise wide solution to our Westchester Hospitals. It has previously signed on to this designation for our Bronx hospitals through the New York City Department of H ealth's Latch -On NYC Initiative to support breastfeeding mothers and to increase the proportion of women that are achieving the World Health Organization's target rate of having the first six months of an infant's life with exclusive breastfeeding. Initia tive Objectives: 104 1. Montefiore will enforce the New York State hospital regulation to not supplement breastfeeding infants with formula feeding unless medically indicated and documented within the infants medical record 2. Provide physical restriction to infant formula by hospital staff including the tracking of infant formula distribution with the health department 3. Discontinue the distribution of free promotional formula 4. Prohibit the display and distribution of infant formula promotion materials in any hospital location. The objectives of the Baby Friendly Hospital are: 1. Have a written breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to all health care staff. 2. Train all health care staff in the skills necessary to implement this policy. 3. Inform all pregnant wom en about the benefits and management of breastfeeding. 4. Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within one hour of birth. 5. Show mothers how to breastfeed and how to maintain lactation, even if they are separated from their infants. 6. Give infants no food or dri nk other than breast -milk, unless medically indicated. 7. Practice rooming in - allow mothers and infants to remain together 24 hours a day. 8. Encourage breastfeeding on demand. 9. Give no pacifiers or artificial nipples to breastfeeding infants. 10. Foster the es tablishment of breastfeeding support groups and refer mothers to them on discharge from the hospital or birth center. Evidence Base: The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) developed and launched in 1991 as a program of the World Health Organization and UNICEF is a part of the global effort to support and enable mothers to initiate breastfeeding their babies, with the recommendation for exclusively breastfeeding infants for their first six months of life. This initiative works to the care of pregnan t women, new mothers and their infants in hospitals and other health providing institutions due to research and clinically reported improved lifelong outcomes in health for both 105 the breastfed infant and the mother. Additional information about the Baby Fr iendly Hospital Initiative can be found here http://www.babyfriendlyusa.org/ . In support of our system wide objectives, Montefiore New Rochelle support mothers who choose to breastfeed by seeking Baby Friendly Hospital Designation, providing additional support to breastfeeding mothers and minimize practices that can interfere with that choice such as supplementing breastfeeding infants with formula, unless medically indicated or at the mother's specific request. Participating hospitals also pledge to end the distribution of promotional formula and materials during the hospital stay and at discharge. Supporting this institutional initiative is a public awareness campaign to promote the health benefi ts of breast milk, and to inform women of their right to receive education, encouragement and support to breastfeed their babies if they choose to do so. When hospitals stop promoting infant formula, mothers are more likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies. The evidence supporting this initiative is strong. Performance Measures and Time Frame Targets: In 2012, over 1,847 infants were delivered at Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital. Of these infants, for the year 2012, 38.4% were exclusively breastfed , 58.6% received supplemental feeding during the initial hospitalization and 92.8% were identified to have been fed any breast milk during the hospital stay. Across the region, from the available WIC statistics provided as a part of the Healthy, Hunger - Free Kids Act of 2010 (the Act), Public Law 111 -296 for the fiscal year (FY) 2012, breastfeeding performance measurements based on program participant data of the number of partially and fully breastfed infants for each WIC State and local agency was prov ided. The WIC program at the Westchester County Department of Health , located in New Rochelle, saw 2192 infants, of which 167 were fully breastfed, 896 were partially breastfed and 1129 were fully formula fed. Performance Measures: Identification of the following Exclusion criteria Delivery Type 106 Skin to Skin Contact Labor Pain Management Type of Infant Feeding through Hospital Stay Pacifier Use Rooming In Previous Breastfeeding Experience & Success (If Applicable) Feeding Intent Barriers to Breastfeeding (for non -exclusive mothers only) Development of the following: Writte n breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to all health care staff. Train all health care staff in the skills necessary to implement this policy. Educational materials and messaging that inform pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding Initiate breastfeeding within one hour of birth. Lactation maintenance education during separation from infant Establishment of breastfeeding support groups for referral upon discharge Time Frame Targets: The time frame established for a chievement of the baby friendly hospital designation for Montefiore New Rochelle is 2017 . Achievement of the entire Latch on NYC for the Bronx hospitals, as a pa rt of the enterprise wide implementation protocol is also expected to be achieved by 2017. Montefiore has established a Breastfeeding Committee that contains an inter - organizational, int erdisciplinary membership from the three labor and delivery campuses of Montefiore (Einstein, Wakefield and New Rochelle), Jacobi Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Supplementary membership is held by the Assistant Commissioner of the Bronx District Public Health Office and the Assistant Commissio ner of the Bureau of Maternal and Infant and Reproductive Health at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Director of the Westchester County Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children program. 107 Referenc es Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
