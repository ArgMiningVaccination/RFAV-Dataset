Cervical dysplasia, a premalignant lesion that can progress to cervical cancer, is caused primarily by asexually transmitted infection with an oncogenic strain of the human papillomavirus (HPV). Not all women with the virus developcervical dysplasia or cervical cancer. It has been postulated there are multiple host factors that contribute to progression of disease. Many of these factors, such as nutrient deficiencies, can be reversed, which will result in regressionof dysplastic lesions. Studies have shown dietary intervention and nutrient supplementation to be effective in preventingcervical cancer. Additionally, local escharotic treatment combined with systemic treatment shows significant potential in reducingdysplasia. Recent advances in vaccination technology demonstrate the effectiveness of an HPV vaccine. The vaccine, however, mayhave many social and cost-prohibiting limitations, as well as health side effects. (Altern Med Rev 2003;8(2):156-170) Introduction and Epidemiology Cervical dysplasia is a premalignant le- sion that can progress to cervical cancer, a com- mon epithelial cancer that is the second-most com-mon cancer in women age 20-39 years. 1 It dispro- portionately affects minority women and women living in underdeveloped countries.2 Internation- ally, invasive cervical cancer accounts for 11.6 percent of all cancers. For every case of invasiveKeri Marshall, ND cancer there are an estimated 50 cases of abnor- mal cervical smears that require monitoring andfollow-up. 3 Current evidence suggests this lesion is primarily caused by a sexually transmitted in- fection with an oncogenic strain of the humanpapillomavirus (HPV). However, since this viral genome is found in healthy women as well as in healthy tissue adjacent to neoplastic lesions, fac-tors unique to individual hosts appear to contrib- ute to disease progression and dysplastic transfor- mation. Invasive cervical cancer develops from precursor lesions of the cervix called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Progression from normal tissue to invasive cervical cancer occurs through a series of increasing grades of cervicaldysplasia (Figure 1). CIN I represents mild dys- plasia and has a high rate of spontaneous remis- sion (60%) and a low rate of progression to carci-noma. In contrast, approximately 38 percent of CIN II and III, moderate to severe dysplasia, will spontaneously regress, and 16-36 percent willprogress to invasive cervical cancer. 4 Because re- porting for CIN is not mandatory, the exact inci- dence is unknown. However, it is estimated that2.5 million women are diagnosed with low-grade cervical abnormalities annually. 5 Routine PAP smear screening is widely credited with reducing cervical carcinoma from the first to the eighth leading cause of cancer death in the United States, but the number of deaths at-tributable to the disease is still high (approximately Keri Marshall, MS, ND - 1996 Master of Science Social and Preventive Medicine, State University of New York at Buffalo; 2001 graduate, National College of NaturopathicMedicine.

Additionally, the medical costs of providing PAP screening are considerable and a significant economic burden to health care sys-tems. 6 Millions of ablative procedures (e.g., cryo- therapy, electrocautery, cone biopsy) are per- formed each year as an approach to treatment.Screening is not available to all women, mainly due to lack of insurance or lack of insurance- wellness plans. In countries without screening,cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women.Risk Factors It is undisputed that infection with sexu- ally acquired HPV is the primary risk factor forcervical cancer and plays a critical role in cervi- cal carcinogenesis. 7,8 Several other cofactors have been implicated in the progression of low-gradeto high-grade lesions and/or the development of cervical cancer, but these remain controversial in clinical trials. 9 These include early age at first in- tercourse, history of multiple sexual partners, oral contraceptive use,10 high parity, low socioeco- nomic status, poor diet, cigarette smoking,11 im- munosuppression,12 and promiscuous male sexual partners.13 In one study, with respect to current use, the risk for cervical dysplasia increased forwomen who had been using oral contraceptives longer than 10 years. 14 A summary of risk factors is outlined in Table 1. The correlation between cervical dyspla- sia and oral contraceptives is based on the premise that steroid hormones, such as estrogen andprogesterone, are thought to play a role in the pro- gression of disease. Progesterone has been re- ported to increase HPV-16 and HPV-18 gene ex-pression at the levels of transcription and mRNA stability. 15,16 Most cases of cervical cancer are in the most estrogen-sensitive region of the cervixknown as the transformation zone, 17 an area that displays a high level of conversion of estradiol to 16-hydroxyestrone. When HPV-16 DNA immor- talizes these cells, this activity increases eight- fold.18 Furthermore, the incidence of HPV DNAFigure 1.

In the United States, the Centers for DiseaseControl docu- mented a 459-per- cent rise in thenumber of visits to private clinics for condyloma acuminata, a genital lesion caused byHPV, between 1966 and 1981. 20 That number con- tinues to rise. Based on data from a cohort of 22- year-old Finnish women, an estimated 79 percentof Finnish women between the ages of 20 and 79 will contract at least one HPV infection. 21 Certain HPV types are associated with certain types of disease, although a given HPV type can cause a range of diseases. HPV are double-stranded DNA viruses of approximately8,000 base pairs. Over 60 types of HPV have been identified. HPV types 6 and 11 are considered low risk and are commonly associated with condylomaacuminata of the lower genital tract and flat cer- vical condyloma. The medium risk groups, HPV types 33, 35, 39, 40, 43, 45, 51-56, and 58, areassociated with low-grade genital dysplasia and carcinomas. The high-risk group of HPV types 16, 18, and 31 are associated with CIN III and malig-nant neoplasia of the penis, cervix, vulva, and perineum (Table 2). 22 Although risk for cervical cancer is sig- nificantly higher with the presence of HPV infec- tion, HPV infection alone may be insufficient to cause cervical cancer. Approximately 28 percentof women with HPV go on to develop CIN. 23 Cur- rent studies indicate HPV exposure is the initiat- ing event. However, for the lesion to be persistentor progress to cervical cancer, other risk factorsmust be present. Over the past two decades, nu- merous epidemiological and laboratory studies have suggested nutritional factors may play an important role in the development and progres-sion of CIN and cervical cancer. Primary Prevention Because a number of important epidemio- logical risk factors have been identified as con- tributing to the development of CIN and cervical cancer, primary prevention should be geared to-ward risk reduction. Of utmost importance with regard to risk reduction is the elimination of risky sexual behavior that increases exposure to HPV.Such behaviors include early sexual experiences, number of sex partners, and male partner factors such as history of venereal disease and number ofsex partners. 24-26 The target population is prima- rily adolescents and young adults.27 Women are most susceptible to potential carcinogens such asHPV during this period. 28 It has been proposed that adolescents are at a greater risk for cervical dysplasia than adultfemales because of biological changes occurring in the cervix during puberty. 29 A study conducted by Massad and Anoina reported that cervical dys-plasia is prevalent in as many as 21 percent of adolescent females. 30 In this population, sexual behaviors are initiated and lifelong patterns areTable 2.

Among sexually active adolescents, interventions should include increased condom use, improved communication with partners and peers, and addressing risk behaviors. It is alsoimportant for women to understand they can be infected with different strains of HPV with a new partner. Existing infection often lowers host im-munity and makes women more susceptible to additional strains of HPV as well as other sexu- ally transmitted diseases. Additionally, risk fac-tors such as smoking need to be addressed at this time. There appears to be a significant correlation between risk of dysplasia and cigarette consump-tion. One study demonstrates the risk for cervical dysplasia rises with increased number of sex part- ners, dependent on the number of cigarettessmoked. 31 Nutritional Intervention Chemoprevention is an attempt to use natural and synthetic compounds to intervene inearly pre-cancerous stages of carcinogenesis be- fore invasive diseases begin. Cervical dysplasia is ideally suited to chemopreventive measuresgiven its well-established pre-invasive state, its multi-step progression toward invasive disease, and the clinical diagnostic ease that allows practi-tioners to follow the lesion without significant invasive techniques. Nutritional intervention is ideally suited as a means of chemoprevention.Adjusting nutrient deficiencies in women at risk of disease progression has been shown to prevent cancer from occurring. Diet Epidemiological studies suggest increased consumption of fruits and vegetables containingantioxidants is associated with lower risks for malignancies. 32-35 Fruits and vegetables are the primary dietary source of carotenoids, vitamin C,and folate, as well as other anticarcinogenic com- pounds, which may have synergistic effects. Re- sults from a randomized controlled dietary inter-vention study of 53 premenopausal women dem- onstrated that dietary intervention could effec- tively promote increased fruit and vegetable in-take. 36 The intervention improved status for bothplasma carotenoids and folate in the target popu- lation, as well as a reduction in total plasma ho- mocysteine. Participants were randomly assigned to a control group or a dietary intervention groupand were followed for one year. The goal of the diet was to promote consumption of 8-10 serv- ings of vegetables and fruits daily. A food-basednutritional cancer prevention strategy, compared to a single-nutrient intervention study, allows for the additive effect of multiple protective dietaryfactors and potential synergy of biological inter- actions that may further enhance protective effects. Although this study did not measure outcomes ofdisease regression, it set the stage for future stud- ies evaluating dietary intervention and the reduc- tion of cervical cancer. Another study assessed dietary risk fac- tors for women with invasive and in situ cervical carcinoma in Bangkok, Thailand. 37 After admin- istering a food-frequency questionnaire, 50 in situ cases were compared to 125 controls, while a sepa- rate group of 134 invasive cases were comparedto 384 controls. The study demonstrated that by increasing intake of foods rich in vitamin A, par- ticularly high retinol foods, there may be a reducedrisk of in situ disease, and at highest level of in- take may inhibit progression to invasive disease. No significant associations were noted among highvitamin C-, folate-, vitamin E-, or beta carotene- foods, or cruciferous vegetables with regard to risk of either in situ or invasive cervical cancer. Cur- rently underway is a randomized trial of 326 women with biopsy proven CIN II to determine if a change in dietary pattern can promote regres-sion of cervical dysplasia. The primary focus of the dietary change is on carotenoids. Vitamin A All-trans retinoic acid and 9-cis retinoic acid are metabolites of vitamin A (retinol) in vivo. Interest in retinoic acid as a chemopreventive agentstems from laboratory research that indicates retinoids are potent modulators of epithelial cell growth and differentiation. 38 Additionally, epide- miological studies report retinol intake and serum retinol levels have been found to be 4.5-times lower among women with cervical dysplasia whoPage 160 Alternative Medicine Review Volume 8, Number 2 2003Cervical Dysplasia Review Copyright\u00a92003 Thorne Research, Inc. All Rights Reserved. No Reprint Without Written Permissionprogress to in situ or invasive disease when com- pared to those whose disease regresses.39 Because of the known teratogenic side effects of high-dose vitamin A, there is limitedapplication of retinoic acid for women of repro- ductive age. To avoid such a problem, a local topi- cal method of delivery to the cervix was designed.Topical application of all-trans-retinoic acid has been shown to enhance the regression of CIN II in randomized clinical trials. 40 A total of 301 women with histologically confirmed CIN II and III were randomized to treatment groups to receive either 1 mL 0.375-percent retinoic acid or placebocream for four consecutive days with follow-up and maintenance treatment for two days at months 3 and 6. Cytology and colposcopy were assessedat 9, 12, 15, 21, and 27 months after initial appli- cation. The primary histological evaluation was assessed at 15 months. Regression of CIN II le-sions occurred in 27 percent of the placebo group and 43 percent of the retinoic acid group. No ef- fect on CIN III lesions was observed. Since the conclusion of this phase III study, several independent laboratory research endeavors have evaluated retinoic acid as achemopreventive agent. Studies have shown that retinoic acid is able to regulate differentiation of normal human ectocervical epithelial cells, 41 in- duce reversible HPV-E6 and -E7 proteins. 43 These labora- tory findings support clinical evidence that retinoicacid is active in preventing cervical cancer and warrants further clinical trials. Carotenoids Although extensive evidence exists for the role of fruits and vegetables in lowering risk of human cancers, the association of carotenoids andcancer is considerably less clear. Carotenoids are obtained from fruits and vegetables, fortified foods, and nutritional supplements. Many experi-mental studies support a cancer preventive role for these compounds. 44 However, in randomizedclinical trials of beta carotene, either no effect45 or increased cancer incidence among high risk subjects46,47 has been observed. To date, the vast majority of research has focused on beta caroteneand epithelial cell cancers; whereas, relatively few studies have investigated the association of other carotenoids with cancer. Studies of cervical dysplasia and caro- tenoids indicate low concentrations of selected (alpha carotene, beta carotene,lycopene, zeaxanthin, and beta cryptoxanthin) are associated with an increased risk of CIN. 48-51 In a recent study of 241 southwestern American Indianwomen, 81 with diagnosed CIN II/III were com- pared to 160 women with normal cervical epithe- lium. After adjusting for confounding factors, thereappeared to be a significant association between decreasing serum carotenoid concentrations and increased risk of CIN, 52 particularly the caro- tenoids beta cryptoxanthin, lutein, and zeaxanthin. Although many studies suggest an asso- ciation between decreased plasma beta caroteneand risk for cervical dysplasias, 53 clinical trials examining the efficacy of beta carotene supple- mentation do not demonstrate a positive effect. Ina randomized, nine-month clinical trial of biopsy confirmed dysplasia in 69 women, 39 received 30 mg beta carotene while 30 were given a lactoseplacebo. 54 Colposcopy and biopsy were performed at baseline and at nine months. Complete regres- sion of disease occurred in 23.1 percent of thecarotene group, while there was 46.7-percent com- plete regression in the placebo group. Partial re- gression occurred in 23.1 percent of the carotenegroup, while there was partial regression in only 3.3 percent of the placebo group. Only one case in each group progressed to cervical cancer. Studyparticipants in the placebo and carotene groups were similar in all regards except for the baseline grade of histopathology. Seventy percent of theplacebo group had a lesion that was less than CIN II compared with 35.9 percent of the intervention group. Similar negative results have been reportedin other clinical trials using 30 mg beta carotene 55,56 as well as studies using a 10 mg dose.57Alternative Medicine Review Volume 8, Number 2 2003 Page 161 Review Cervical Dysplasia Copyright\u00a92003 Thorne Research, Inc.

Recent studiesindicate I3C has the potential to prevent and even treat a number of common cancers, especially those that are estrogen related. 58 Indole-3-carbinol is rapidly converted in the stomach to a variety of condensation products, including diindolyl- methane (DIM), indolylcarbazole (ICZ), and 2-(indol-3-ylmethyl)-3,3'-diindolylmethane (L-Tr- 1) (Figure 2). 59 Plasma from humans and rats fed I3C contains no detectable I3C, but rather largeamounts of DIM and other metabolites. 60 Thus, metabolic products of I3C are probably the major compounds initially available to cells after inges-tion of I3C. However, laboratory studies suggest I3C can act in several different ways to prevent transformation and/or tumor progression, as wellas to kill transformed cells selectively. Indole-3-carbinol, through its action on cytochrome P-450, is known to alter the pathwayof estrogen metabolism in human males and fe- males in a manner that decreases the risk of cer- tain tumors. 61-63 Metabolism is altered by induc- cytochrome P-450 isoforms, via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor,64 for which DIM is a weak ligand.65 Metabolic degradation of estradiolby liver cells results primarily in either 2- hydroxyestrone or 16 -hydroxyestrone, and to a lesser extent 4-hydroxyestrone, a potent carcino- gen. It is known that 16 -hydroxyestrone causes proliferation of some breast tumor cell lines,66 while the alternative metabolite, 2-hydroxyestrone, has antiestrogenic andantiproliferative activity. 67 Women with CIN II/ III have lower 2-hydroxyestrone/16 - hydroxyestrone ratios than women with no abnor- mal cervical pathology;68 therefore, the goal is to up-regulate 2-hydroxylation. While tumor-associated viruses can pro- foundly affect the 2-hydoxyestrone/16 - hydroxyestrone ratio, attempts to directly decrease 16-hydroxylation have not proved to be effec- tive. However, by up-regulating 2-hydroxylation, estradiol is metabolized to a benign product at the expense of 16 -hydroxylation. Several com- pounds have proven to be effective in up-regulat- ing 2-hydroxylation; Niwa et al found I3C to be the most potent.69 Indole-3-carbinol also appears to suppress 4-hydroxylation activity.70 In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 30 patients with biopsy-confirmed CIN II-III were randomized to receive placebo or 200 or 400 mg oral I3C daily for 12 weeks. 71 Three patients did not complete the study. None of the10 patients in the placebo group had completeFigure 2.

All Rights Reserved. No Reprint Without Written Permissionregression of CIN. In contrast, four of eight patients in the 200-mg/day group and four of nine in the 400-mg/day group had complete regression of CIN based on 12-week biopsy. In this study,the highest dose, 400 mg/day, is equivalent to one- third of a head of cabbage. No adverse effects were noted in this or previous studies. An in vitro study of I3C was performed on human cervical cancer cell lines to determine if I3C and DIM could induce apoptosis. 72 This study concluded both I3C and DIM are able to achieve apoptosis in the cervical epithelium of HPV-16 transgenic mice, suggesting use as apotential chemotherapeutic agent. Folate and Homocysteine Folate deficiency cervi- cal dysplasia as early as 1966.73 It has been hy- pothesized that subclinical folate deficiency, even if transient or localized, allows for incorporationof the HPV genome into host DNA with resultant malignant transformations. 74 The strongest asso- ciation has been observed between low red bloodcell (RBC) folate and HPV-16. However, there is strong evidence that current oral contraceptive use may constitute an independent risk, even with ac-ceptable folate levels. 75 Whitehead et al demonstrated megalo- blastic changes in cervical smears of oral contra-ceptive users in the absence of general folate de- ficiency. 76 Oral folate therapy for two weeks led to improvement in cervical cytology despite \"nor-mal\" blood folate. It has also been reported that taking oral contraceptives leads to increased se- rum copper 77 and decreased serum folate by inter- ference with intestinal elevated homocysteine lev-els. 78 Folate metabolism is closely linked with the methylation cycle and DNA biosynthesis,which requires the insertion by a one-carbon for remethylation ofhomocysteine and subsequent me- thylation of DNA by S-adenosyl methionine. Thus, folate deficiency not only increases homocysteine concentrations within the cell, it also impairs DNAbiosynthesis, 79 which is crucial to cell growth, re- production, and differentiation. Consequently, low tissue folate causes an increase in the frequencyof fragile sites on DNA, 80 the risk of DNA for at- tack by carcinogens and viruses,81 and the poten- tial for chromosomal damage and oncogene ex-pression, 82,83 and inhibits DNA repair.80 The degree of hypomethylation of cervi- cal tissue was observed in a series of biopsysamples from 41 women. 84 A significant degree of DNA methylation was present in low-grade CIN, while there was a significant decrease inDNA methylation in the cases of high-grade CIN and carcinoma. Additionally, an in vitro study dem- onstrated methylation selectively down-regulatesHPV-18 transcription. 85 Despite positive laboratory findings sup- porting a role for folic acid in the cervical cancercontinuum, clinical trials have not demonstrated positive results with supplementation. In a trial by Butterworth et al, 235 subjects with CIN I or IIwere randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg folic acid or placebo (10 mg ascorbic acid) daily for six months. 86 After six months, there was no difference between cases or controls with regard to dysplasia status, biopsy results, or HPV-16 in- fection. The same author published a case-controlstudy of 726 women in The Journal of the Ameri- can Medical Association the same year. This study revealed low red blood cell folate levels, below660 nmol/L, enhance the effects of several risk factors for cervical dysplasia, but particularly HPV-16 infection. 74 Childers et al also conducted a phase III trial to determine whether high-dose folic acid improves regression of early stage CIN. The ef-fects of treatment with 5 mg folic acid daily or placebo for six months were compared in 331 ran- domized women. 81 Patient HPV status was not determined. Similarly, this study did not demon- strate significant improvement for the treatment group compared to controls. After three monthsof treatment, 8.1 percent of the folate interven- tion group had lesions that improved while onlyAlternative Medicine Review Volume 8, Number 2 2003 Page 163 Review Cervical Dysplasia Copyright\u00a92003 Thorne Research, Inc. All Rights Reserved. No Reprint Without Written Permission2.8 percent of the placebo had improvements. However, after six months of follow-up, seven percent of the folate group and six percent of the placebo group showed improvements. Both theChilders and Butterworth trials had a high num- ber of patients with CIN I, a lesion with a high spontaneous regression rate and low rate of pro-gression. It remains unclear if folic acid supple- mentation would be more effective in preventing progression of moderate and severe dysplasia.Although no research has been conducted to sup- port this theory, it is possible some cases of dys- plasia may be a result of inability to properly con-vert folic acid to one of its more active forms, such as folinic acid or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. More research is required to determine whether supple-mentation with one of these forms would provide more benefit in the prevention or treatment of dysplasia. Antioxidants Low plasma levels of antioxidants have consistently been linked to increased incidence ofcancer and precancerous states. 87,88 Studies have measured the association between various plasma and tissue antioxidant levels and severity of CINand cervical cancer. In one study, plasma levels of total coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and alpha toco- pherol were measured by high performance liq-uid chromatography in patients with biopsy-con- firmed CIN (n=55), cervical cancer (n=20), and in controls with normal PAP smears (n=27). Re-sults showed mean plasma levels of CoQ10 and alpha tocopherol were significantly lower in pa- tients with diagnosed CIN and cervical cancerwhen compared to controls. Levels of CoQ10 from cervicovaginal epithelial cells were measurable and also appeared to be significantly lower inwomen diagnosed with CIN. 89 These findings sug- gest low levels of these two antioxidants may play a role in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer. Onthe other hand, low plasma levels may also reflect increased utilization of antioxidants to counteract oxidative stress, suggesting the body needs supple-mentation to continue this process efficiently.Plasma ascorbic acid (AA) levels in smok- ers are lower in both normal women 90 and women with cervical dysplasias.91 Sixty-two women with abnormal PAP smears underwent colposcopy and biopsy as well as cervicovaginal lavage to collect exfoliated epithelial cells.92 Measurements of AA and glutathione (GSH) were evaluated and mea-sured by standardized methods. The study dem- onstrated that the total number of cells retrieved in lavage specimens of smokers is significantlyhigher compared to the nonsmoker group, suggest- ing rapid exfoliation of epithelial cells may be a factor in the pathogenesis of dysplasias. However, AA and GSH levels were not statistically signifi- cant among the various groups of women with histopathologically diagnosed cervical dysplasia.The small sample size in each dysplasia group may account for this finding. Although the role of selenium and cervi- cal cancer has not been studied extensively, stud- ies have found no relationship between serum se- lenium and invasive cervical cancer. 93,94 To date no studies, either clinically or in vitro, have been performed to assess selenium status in women with precancerous or dysplastic states. Escharotic Treatment The use of escharotic or caustic treatments for epithelial cancers is based on a centuries-oldobservation that select plant and mineral extracts could be used to treat topical skin lesions. Zinc chloride (ZnCl), and Sanguinaria canadensis (bloodroot) are the two agents traditionally used as part of the Mohs chemosurgery fixed-tissue technique. 95 ZnCl was used as a fixative while bloodroot was used as an organic stabilizer. The paste application, fixation, and excision of the tu- mor were repeated daily until microscopic exami-nation finding was negative for any tumor. 96 A small study using local escharotic treatment was conducted on seven women withcarcinoma in situ of the cervix. 97 Three levels of treatment were employed: local treatment to the cervix, systemic treatment, and constitutionaltreatment.

ZnCl 2/Sanguinaria mixture. Take 1/4 tsp ZnCl 2 solution and place in empty cup. Add 3/4 tsp Sanguinaria tincture to this same bottle. This will now be the mixture used for one treatment. b. One cup distilled water. c. 1/3 cup calendula succus. d. A cup containing two powdered bromelain capsules or tablets. 2. Insert speculum and visualize the cervix.3. Blot the cervix dry with large cotton swab or cotton ball on the end of a ring forceps.4. Dip a large cotton swab into the distilled water and then squeeze out the water with your fingers. Place the damp swab into the bromelain and attempt to thickly cover the face of the cervix with the powder. Repeat 2-4 times in order to cover properly. The same step must be done in the endocervical canal with a small cotton tip applicator. Dampen the applicator, place in the bromelain, and apply to endocervix 1-3 times. Use a new cotton tip applicator each time.5. Leave the bromelain on the cervix and in the endocervical canal for 15 minutes. A GYN lamp should be placed facing the vagina so that gentle heat is provided during this portion of the treatment.6. Now remove the bromelain by placing a large cotton swab in the calendula succus and then applying it to the cervix, thus washing off the bromelain. This must also be done with a small cotton tip applicator to the endocervical canal. Be liberal; repeat 2-4 times. Take a dry large swab and absorb the washings that have pooled in the vagina.7. Now soak a large swab in the ZnCl 2/Sangiunaria mixture that you prepared earlier. Apply this to the cervix once. Repeat this procedure with a small cotton tip applicator and insert in the endocervical canal. Leave on for one minute. If this causes pain, wash the cervix with a small amount of distilled water. Avoid contact of the ZnCl 2/Sanguinaria mixture with the vaginal wall. 8. Wash off the ZnCl 2/Sanguinaria mixture with swabs of calendula solution. Wash the endocervical canal as well with a cotton tip applicator. Absorb the liquid that has pooled in the vagina with a dry cotton swab.9. Insert two vitamin A suppositories. Using forceps or other appropriate instruments, attempt to have suppositories lie lengthwise across the cervix. Instruct the patient to leave the suppositories in place for 24 hours (using small sanitary napkin due to leakage). Note: The escharotic treatment is best done twice a week with two full days between treatments. Adapted from: Hudson T.

Local treatment was repeated twice weekly for five weeks with treatments 2-3 days apart. Topical vitamin A was appliedfollowing each local treatment. Systemic treatment was comprised of ascorbic acid 6-10 g per day, beta carotene 120,000-180,000 IU per day, andselenium 400 mcg per day. Patients were also prescribed a vegan diet to eliminate animal fats and two botanical compounds to enhance immunefunction - Taraxacum officinalis and Arctium lappa. Systemic treatment was continued for not less than three months. Constitutional treatmentconsisted of a homeopathic remedy prescribed on an individual basis. All seven patients received one year of follow-up. Four of the women remained disease free after the one-year period. One woman im- proved to atypia and then reverted to mild dyspla-sia. One woman had resolution of the cells of the endocervix and not the ectocervix, and one woman had resolution of the cells of the ectocervix andnot the endocervix. The latter patients appeared to be non-compliant with regard to diet and lifestyle changes, suggesting the influence of syn-ergistic effects of this multi-modality approach. A follow-up study was performed by the same group on 43 cases, including cervical atypia(n=7), cervical dysplasia (n=26), and carcinoma in situ (n=10) during the following two years. 98 A similar protocol was used, with the addition of 10mg folic acid daily. The results of the study were encouraging as 38 of the women had complete re- gression to normal, while three of the women hadpartial regression and two had persistent lesions. The two women with persistent lesions had low- grade dysplasia. These studies yield promisingresults, suggesting the need for a multi-faceted ap- proach to preventing cervical cancer. Table 3 sum- marizes the escharotic treatment. HPV Vaccine Most recently, the HPV vaccine has been introduced to the conventional medical commu-nity as a means to prevent cervical cancer. The vaccine has been touted as \"the beginning of the end for cervical cancer.\" 99 Vaccines against HPV,both the strains commonly associated with cervi- cal cancer and those associated with genital warts, are a priority for a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms. In recent years, two compa-nies, Cantab of Cambridge, England and MedImmune of Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA, have conducted human trials of these vaccines.Merck has also produced a vaccine that has been tested successfully in double-blind trials. Cantab has created TA-HPV, a live recom- binant vaccinia virus engineered to express the E6 and genes from HPV type-16 and -18, the prin- ciple viruses associated with cervical cancer. 100 MedImmune's prophylactic vaccine is called MEDI-501, which consists of recombinant HPV- 11 L1 protein. Recombinant L1 has the propertyto self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs). VLPs contain no viral DNA and are considered noninfectious. Merck has created the naked plas-mid DNA vaccine, which appears to be more cost effective and has the ability to be processed intra- cellularly, resulting in a more potent cellular im-mune response. 101 In November 2002, The New England Journal of Medicine reported on a randomized, multicenter, double-blind study of 2,392 young women, ages 16-23 years, who received three doses of placebo or HPV-16 virus-like particlevaccine (40 \u00b5g per dose), given at day 0, month 2, and month 6. This study was fully funded by Merck. The women were followed a median of17.4 months. Only 1,533 women were eligible for primary analysis. Forty-one cases of persistent HPV-16 infection occurred in the placebo groupand none in the vaccine group. Forty-four cases of preinvasive cervical neoplasia not associated with HPV-16 infection were identified, 22 in eachgroup. 102 A major limitation to this study is that primary analysis was limited to women who were negative for HPV-16 DNA and HPV-16 antibod-ies both at enrollment and at month 7, suggesting HPV-16 can potentially develop during the course of vaccination, but results were excluded in finalassessment. Although the vaccine was generally well tolerated, a slightly higher percentage of womenin the vaccine group than in the placebo groupPage 166 Alternative Medicine Review Volume 8, Number 2 2003Cervical Dysplasia Review Copyright\u00a92003 Thorne Research, Inc.

The most common side effect reported waspain at the sight of injection, experienced by both placebo and vaccinated groups. Systemic events were reported by 41.6 percent of the vaccinatedgroup and 43.5 percent of the placebo group. The term systemic event was not defined. Serious ad- verse effects were reported in the vaccine and pla- cebo group, 0.4 and 0.3 percent, respectively, caus- ing discontinuation of the study. Discussion Despite potential progress in the medical community, a number of challenges to widespread use of the HPV vaccine can be anticipated. Publichealth officials will need to address the consider- able social implications for what amounts to be an \"STD vaccine.\" Vaccination would begin inearly adolescence, making it necessary for par- ents and doctors to discuss sex with children. In Journal Watch Women's Health , from the publish- ers of The New England Journal of Medicine , Dr. Andrew Kaunitz brings to light a few important questions: (1) In the United States, where the fed-eral government supports universal vaccination of children, will there be political obstacles to fund- ing a vaccine that makes sex safer? (2) Given thatthe main beneficiaries of an HPV vaccine will be women, will parents of teenage boys balk at hav- ing their sons vaccinated? and (3) In less devel-oped countries where invasive cervical cancer is most prevalent, will cost considerations and the need for three injections limit vaccine use? 103 The vaccine is projected to cost $100 per dose. With three doses of the vaccine required to confer HPV immunity, the cost may be prohibitive in poor na-tions where cervical cancer kills an estimated 250,000 women a year. Although numerous epidemiological stud- ies have examined the association between risk of cervical cancer and dietary cofactors, most stud- ies appear to have methodological limitations. Amajor limitation of many observational studies is reliance on dietary self-report, which has many potential sources of error and bias. Also, manynutritional epidemiological studies were con- ducted before a reliable test for HPV status was available. 104 As with many nutritional-based clinical trials, nutrient-based cervical cancer prevention trials have been designed without adequate infor- mation or qualitative analysis as to when in thecarcinogenesis continuum a particular nutrient is actively effective. Additionally, little light has been shed on the duration of treatment and length offollow-up needed to demonstrate an effect. Cur- rent evidence suggests nutritional factors play a role in the progression of normal cervical epithe-lium to preinvasive cervical lesions and ultimately carcinoma. However, lack of knowledge of bio- logical mechanisms, which determines optimaltiming for intervention, is lacking. This ultimately deters the ability to test the effect of a nutrient appropriately in clinical trials. To date, only fivephase III nutrient chemoprevention trials have been completed, with only one showing positive effect. Until more intervention studies have beencompleted, it is reasonable to assume nutrient supplementation may be an effective tool in pre- venting progression of cervical dysplasia to cer- vical cancer, especially when serum and plasma markers unequivocally demonstrate specific nu- trient deficiencies. More importantly, adequatedosage and duration of treatment need to be fur- ther evaluated. References 1. Greenlee RT, Hill-Harmon MB, Murray T, Thun M. Cancer statistics, 2001.
