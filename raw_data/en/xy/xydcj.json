Getting certain vaccines during pregnancy can help protect you and your child from serious health complications and potentially life-threatening illnesses. At Advocate Health Care, we provide personalized recommendations to keep you and your baby safe throughout your pregnancy. We offer [pregnancy care](https://www.advocatehealth.com/health-services/obstetrics/) and [vaccinations](/health-services/primary-care/preventive-care/vaccinations/) in multiple convenient locations throughout the Chicago metro area. You have easy access to the care you need, when and where you need it. Some vaccines are safe to get during pregnancy, while others aren't. In general, you can get mRNA vaccines, such as the COVID vaccine, and inactive vaccines (ones that contain dead viruses or bacteria). You shouldn't get vaccines that contain live, weakened viruses or bacteria. When you get a vaccine, your body creates proteins (antibodies) that help your immune system fight a specific disease. Antibodies protect you from getting severe, potentially life-threatening illnesses. When you're pregnant, vaccines don't just protect you - they protect your unborn baby, too. The antibodies your body creates pass through the placenta and help boost your baby's immune system. The specific vaccines you need depend on several factors, including your age, health risks, travel plans and vaccination history. In general, most pregnant women need two routine vaccines during pregnancy: Your provider may also recommend the [COVID vaccine](/covid/). Getting the COVID vaccine before or during pregnancy can help protect your baby from severe illness before they can safely get a COVID vaccination at 6 months old. The Tdap vaccine is vital for protecting your baby. When you get the Tdap vaccine, you create antibodies that pass to your baby and prevent them from getting whooping cough. The Tdap vaccine is especially important because whooping cough is the most severe and potentially life-threatening illness that can occur within your baby's first six months of life. Getting the Tdap vaccine protects your baby during those first six months before they can safely get vaccinated. You may hear the Tdap vaccine referred to as a 3-in-1 vaccine. That's because it protects against three diseases: tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. Your provider will give you specific guidance about when to get vaccinations during pregnancy. In general, you should get: Health care providers advise against getting certain vaccines while pregnant: If you haven't received all your routine vaccines, talk with your health care provider about catching up. Some vaccines should be given before you become pregnant and not during your pregnancy. Your provider may recommend getting the COVID vaccine during pregnancy. Pregnant women are more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID, so vaccination is important for protection. There's no specific time during pregnancy when doctors routinely recommend COVID immunization. It depends on when you last received the COVID vaccine. You can get the COVID vaccine along with other immunizations. Most vaccines are safe to get while you're breastfeeding. Your health care provider can tell you whether you need any routine vaccines after you give birth. We help you live well. And we're here for you in person and online. "}
