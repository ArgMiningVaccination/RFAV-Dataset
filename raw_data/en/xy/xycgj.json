Emphasis on Developing Palliative Care Goals Recognizing a continuing need to discuss critical issues rela ted to developing and revising plans of care for patien ts residing in nursing faciliti es at the end of life, the Missouri End of Life Coaliti on established an End of Life in the Nursing Home Task Force to provide guidance on appropriate pallia tive care objectives for residents in long- term care facilities. The task force and the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Se rvices, Division of Senior Services and Regulation have produ ced this consensus document. Between 2001 and 2003, the group met with key healthcare agencies and orga nizations throughout Missouri to ensure that expe rtise in long-term care, pa in and symptom management, nutrition, spiritual and psychos ocial care, administration, and public health were fully represented. The goals of the task force were to identify barriers to pr oper end-of-life care; increase the clarity of the value and role of end-of-life care goals for LTC facility residents and their families; develop clinical tools to a ssist in the identification of appropriate residents for end-of-life care goals and e ducate care givers about th ese goals provide for their implementation and appropriate use; identify common language and culture difference and provide education to develop clearer communication; investigate barriers to provi ding effective hospice servi ces in nursing facilities by profiling existing facilities where hospice care is provided effectively and efficiently; review the conditions of participation re lated to hospice in facility settings; develop a process by which LTC facilities are encouraged to utilize hospice to provide the benefit from hospice care for dying patients and their families; provide education for hospices, long- term care facilities, hospice regulators, and long- term care regulators on nursing f acilities requirements regarding hospice and end-of-life care for LTC facilities residents. The resulting guidelines are a source of information for facility staff.

The Coalition is comprised of professionals, practitioners, policymakers, regulators, affiliated professional associations and end-of-life car e providers. The mission of the Coalition is to foster cooperation, education and rese arch to promote high quality care for the dying. The Coalition identified access to adequate end-o f-life care (including hospice care) in nursing homes as a problem, and fo rmed a task force of nursing home and hospice associations, providers, and state survey agencies to deal with this problem. The initial goal was to identify state regul atory and reimbursement concerns and other barriers that impede utilization and access. In its initial attempt to explore the problem in 1999, the task force gathered two focus gr oups of providers to discuss the issue. The focus groups perceived regulatory issues as barriers; however, they did not find any regulations preventing the adequate prov ision of appropriate end-of-life care in Missouri nursing homes. The access barriers th ey did find include the existence of myths and a lack of education and co ordination among nursing homes, nursing home surveyors, and hospice agencies. Many regulatory concerns have been expre ssed about the care provided for residents dying in long-term care (hereafter, LTC) . The committee felt it was important for state survey agencies to gi ve direction to LTC faciliti es and hospice providers to correct or diminish misinformation. This manual is designed to help LTC staff understand their role and responsibility to prov ide palliative care. Palliative care is an important and necessary goal for nursing home residents, 30 percent of whom will die from chronic or acute illness within the first year of their admission into a nursing facility. The goal of this manual is to show LTC staff when and how to set appropriate palliative care goals. It will al so serve as a reference tool and guide to additional resources. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 1 of 2 Section 1.0 Introduction Subsection 1.2 Dying in Nursing Homes Issued 09/01/2003 Dying in Nursing Homes Death in America is changing. Many years ago death occurred in homes; then it moved into hospitals, and recent trends i ndicate that death is moving into nursing home settings. Currently, 28 percent of deaths in Missouri occur in nursing homes, compared to a national average of 24 percent (Abbasi and Rudman, 1994). Some sources estimate that by 2020, 40 percent of deaths in this country will occur in nursing homes (Christopher, 2000). Death is already a frequent occurrence in the long-term care setting as approximately one-third of nursing home residents die with in one year of admission. Research has shown that the quality of e nd-of-life care throughout the he althcare system is in need of improvement. Nursing homes, like all other healthcare institutions, face major challenges in meeting family expectations at the end of life (Hanson, Danis, and Garrett, 1997). Pain and symptom control, and spiritual and emotional supports are necessary and require a specialized fo cus at the end of life (Keay, 1999). Recently, much attention has been given to the discrepancy between the way individuals desire to die and the way they are dying. Dying in our country is not always a peaceful process. In a national survey in 1999, half of the respondents said the healthcare system does not always keep dying patients pain-free (Fackelmann, 1999). In 1997, the American Health Decisi ons Project conducted thirty-six focus groups throughout the country and found that people fear reaching the end of their lives dependent on machines. Participants expressed a preference for a natural death in familiar surroundings and in the presence of loved ones. Participants said they did not believe the current healthcare system is consistent with their views on death and dying, and that current planning options do not support patient management of the death and dying experience (Stanley, 1997). Further research tends to substantiate the public's f ears. The Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT), published in 1995, discovered that 38 percent of seriously ill patients who died during the study spent at least ten days in an inte nsive care unit of a hospital. It also found that of patients who were conscious when they died (about 50 percent of the study group who died in the hospital), family memb ers reported moderate to severe pain in these patients at least half the time. Data show that Missouri is no different. A recent study by Brown Medical School (2001) found that 47 percent of terminally ill patients in Missouri nursing homes experience persistent pain. Numerous studies have tried to determine th e causes of our inability to provide better care for the dying. Barriers to proper care for the dying in clude inadequate reimbursement, cultural att itudes on death and dying, disc omfort with communicating END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 2 of 2 Section 1.0 Introduction Subsection 1.2 Dying in Nursing Homes Issued 09/01/2003 bad news and prognoses, and healthcare provid ers' lack of education on caring for the dying. In a survey conducted by the Amer ican Medical Association (AMA) in 1997- 1998, only four medical schools required coursework on care for the dying. In response to its survey, the AMA developed a curriculum to help practicing physicians improve their end-of-life practice (Emmanuel, VonGute n, Ferris, and Portnoy, 1999). As a result of the attention being brought to these limitations in the healthcare system's focus on dying in America, a new specialization is ga ining attention and support. This medical specialization involve s the practice of palliative medicine. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 1 of 1 Section 1.0 Introduction Subsection 1.3 Define Palliative Care Issued 09/01/2003 Defining Palliative Care Many groups have defined palliative medici ne. Each definition has a common focus on relieving suffering and improving quality of life. Palliative medicine has traditionally been tied to the provision of hospice care; however, there are numerous obstacles to the use of hospice care. Ther efore, the \"palliative care movement\" has broadened beyond hospice and now recognizes that hospice care is only one model of palliative medicine. It is not necessary fo r a resident to be in a hospice program to receive palliative care. Residents can benefit significantly from a palliative approach in which attention to the patient's phys ical, spiritual, and psychosocial problems becomes the guiding philosophy. Regardless of the exact program or mode l, the World Health Organization (WHO) defines palliative care as the active total care of patients whose disease is not responsive to curative treatment. Control of pain, of other symptoms, and of psychological, social and spiritual problems, is paramount. The goal of palliative care is achievement of the best quality of life for patients and their families. Many aspects of palliative care are also appli cable earlier in the course of the illness in conjunction with anti-cancer treatment (1990). WHO expanded the definition to include si x additional points regarding palliative care. Palliative care: affirms life and regards dying as a normal process; neither hastens nor postpones death; provides relief from pain and other distressing symptoms; integrates the psychological and sp iritual aspects of care, fostering opportunities to grow; offers an interdisciplinary team to help residents live as actively as possible until death; and offers support systems for the family dur ing the resident's illness and their own bereavement (1990). END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 1 of 1 Section 1.0 Introduction Subsection 1.4 Principles of Palliative Care Issued 09/01/2003 Principles of Palliative Care \"Principles for Care of Patients at the End of Life,\" authored by renowned palliative physicians Christine Cassell and Kathleen Foley, is a declar ation of basic principles for all healthcare professionals. It has been endorsed by a growing number of physician organizations. The American Medi cal Association, Am erican Association of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, American Geriatric Society, American College of Physicians, American Association of Fam ily Practice, American Medical Directors Association, American Colle ge of Surgeons, American Academy of Pediatricians, and the American Pain Society, among others, have accepted these principles. These principles are quite applicable to th e LTC facility and s hould guide efforts at providing humane, palliative care: Respect the dignity of both pati ent [resident] and care givers. Be sensitive and respectful of the patie nt's [resident's] and family's wishes. Use the most appropriate measures that are consistent with patient [resident] choices. Encompass alleviation of pain and other physical symptoms. Assess and manage psychological, social and spiritual/religious problems. Offer continuity (the patient should be ab le to continue to be cared for if so desired by his primary care a nd specialist providers). Provide access to any therapy that may be expected to improve the patient's [resident's] quality of lif e including alternative or nontraditional treatments. Provide access to palliati ve care and hospice care. Respect the right to refuse treatment. Respect the physician's professional re sponsibility to discontinue some treatments when appropriate with consid eration of both patient [resident] and family preferences. 1 Promote clinical and evidence-based rese arch on providing care at the end of life. 1 While these principles may provide overall guidance for end-of-life care, the work group urges long-term care facilities to consult with their legal counsel with regard to surrogate decision-making issues. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 1 of 1 Section 1.0 Introduction Subsection 1.5 Identifying Residents for Palliative Care Issued 09/01/2003 Identifying Residents for Palliative Care Deciding if a resident is appr opriate for palliative care is not an easy task. Physicians, residents, families and staff are challenged to determine when a resident is coming to the end of his or her life. Since most people are somewhat familiar with the hospice model of palliative care, we will use hospice criteria to help LTC staff identify residents eligible for palliative care. The following general cr iteria are used by hospice agencies to determine eligibility. The eligible patient: has been diagnosed with a term inal or life ending illness; has a life expectancy of six months or less, as determined by the attending physician and the hospice interdisciplinary team; is seeking palliative care (pain and symptom relief) rath er than curative treatment. understands, as do the family and his or her physicians that artificial, life prolonging procedures are not consis tent with hospice care; and has been approved for admission to hospi ce services by the a ttending physician and the hospice medical director. The most difficult part of determining a pati ent's eligibility for hospice benefits is the physician's certification that the patient has a prognosis of six months or less. To help physicians and hospices identify patients w ho may be hospice appropriate, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ha ve issued a Local Medical Review Policy (LMRP) that defines (by disease) prognostic criteria that should be examined to determine the patient's eligibility. These guidelines examine documentable evidence that \"if the disease follows its normal course: the prognosis would be six months or less.\" Currently, tw elve guidelines have been identified including lung disease, heart disease, kidne y failure, HIV, stroke and coma, dementia, liver failure, ALS, lung cancer, prostate cancer , breast cancer and decline in health status. The LMRPs for De mentia and Decline in Health Status are included in the appendix section of this ma nual. Other LMRP guidelines can be viewed on the web at www.iamedicare.com/provider/policies .

Goals for care need to refl ect the resident's change of condition. These goals result fr om purposeful conversations with the resident/responsible party, famil y, facility staff, and physician. Objectives Understand the diversity of residents in long-term care facilities, and thus the need for individualized plans of care. Appreciate the need for, and know how to develop and change the plan of care based on the resident's or responsible party's wishes. Apply regulatory guidance for end- of-life care in long-term care. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 1 of 2 Section 2.0 Goals of Care Subsection 2.2 Individualized Care Issued 09/01/2003 Individualized Care \u2014 Purposeful Observation and Conversations Long-Term Care facilities care for a wide vari ety of residents. Ca regivers may have a difficult time meeting all the needs of this diverse population. A LTC facility may have residents with any combination of the following characteristics: physical impairment cognitive impairment behavioral symptoms mental illness mental retardation young residents very old residents cultural diversity lifestyle diversity residents in the last stages of life As a result of diverse needs in this populati on, it is important that the care plan be based on the individual resident's strengths, need s and problems. These individualized care plans are developed using in terdisciplinary experts incl uding the resident, physician, family, social worker, activities director, dietitian, ch arge nurses involved in the resident's care, and nurse aides directly responsible for the resident's care. Th is individualized care planning process forms the basis of the Resi dent Assessment Instrument (RAI) which is required in every Medicare/Medicaid certified facility. An RAI coordinator should also be a member of the planning team. Individual ca re planning is the standard of practice for any care delivery system. Residents living in the end stag es of life have great needs, and their care plans should be revised frequently. The \"art and science\" of nursi ng is portrayed at its best in palliative caregiving. Purposeful Observation and Conversations Individualized care requires that facility servi ces \"fit the resident,\" rather than expect the resident's goals and needs to \"fit the facilit y.\" This approach celebrates the uniqueness of each resident. Generic care doe s not consider the uniqueness of each resident, but treats all residents alike. If a facility develops e xpertise in providing i ndividualized care to a variety of residents, then individualized care will automatically continue across the continuum of care as the resident's condition declines. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 2 of 2 Section 2.0 Goals of Care Subsection 2.2 Individualized Care Issued 09/01/2003 Recognizing subtle changes in each resident can be difficult and requires that purposeful attention be given to each one, including pa rticipation in purposefu l conversations with the resident or the responsibl e party. These purposeful obser vations and conversations are important; as the resident's condition change s; so, too, will the goals of treatment and symptom management. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Advance Care Planning Resident-centered, end-of-life care planning re quires an understanding of the resident's cultural and religious beliefs, values, preferences, and fears. Caregivers must also know about the things that give joy a nd quality to the resident's life. The more knowledge the interdisciplinary care planning team has a bout the resident's value system, the more likely it is to establish a care plan that meets the resident's needs and allows for appropriate interventions as symptoms change. Defining Quality of Life An individual develops pref erences based on religion, culture, life experiences, family relationships, and one's particular view of living and dying. The Interdisciplinary Team (IDT) should engage in purposeful conversations with residents to ensure that their values and preferences are understood. The team can help resident s articulate their unique concepts of quality of life by asking questions. For example, As you look into your future, what do you want? Have you thought about what you would like the last phase of your life to be like? What will be most important for you during that time? An individual's views may change over time as life circumstances change. Therefore, ongoing discussions are needed to ensure that the IDT adequately understands the resident's current view of life. The team 's openness and acceptan ce will facilitate its understanding of what quality of life means to the resident. End-of-life care discussions may include cardiopulmonary re suscitation (CPR), artifici al nutrition and hydration, hospital transfer, withholding di agnostic tests, and treatmen t of an existing diagnosis, such as congested heart failure or osteoporosis. Residents without Decision-Making Ability Residents without decision-making ability comp rise a large portion of the long-term care population. Court appointment of a legal guardian may be nece ssary if a resident has not executed a living will or advance helath ca re directives, or designated a surrogate decision-maker through a durable power of atto rney for health care. Guardianship may also be necessary if these documents do not provide appropriate authority or guidance with respect to a particular situation. If there is no lega l decision maker and no living will or advance directives addressing the situation, th e facility is urged to consult its attorney for advice. Ethical issues re lating to surrogate decision -making are addressed in a Midwest Bioethics Center document entitled, Considerations Regar ding Life-Prolonging Treatment for Residents of Long-term Care Facilities . This guidelines document suggests that \"Surrogates recognized by providers/facilities and not ap pointed by [the resident] or court order should share in the decision maki ng process with the physician, family, and Page 1 of 4 Section 2.0 Goals of Care Subsection 2.3 Advance Care Planning Issued 09/01/2003 END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES representatives of the facility.\" 1 The IDT must have ongoing disc ussions with the family or the surrogate decision maker as conditions and symptoms change. Using an Ethics Case Consultation may be appropriate if conflic ts arise between the goals of the family or surrogates and those th e facility deems appropriate. Do cumenting these decisions is necessary to demonstrate the individualized na ture of the decision a nd the coordination of care resulting from the process. Shaping Care and Setting Goals The purpose of advance care planning is to allow the resident to help shape the care he or she receives during the last stages of life. Physical or cognitive declines cannot be predicted with certainty. The IDT will make be tter decisions if it has relevant information about y the resident's clinical condition and prognosis, and y personal beliefs and social views. With this information, the team can re spond appropriately and proactively when decisions are needed. Consistent with state law, the decision of the resident or the resident's surrogate should direct the goa ls of care. With the appearance of each symptom, the IDT team should determine th e goal of treatment for that symptom and begin care to reach that goal. Ethics Case Consultation Situations of conflict may arise within th e IDT. The conflict can be between family members or between professiona l staff and family members re garding the goals of care. Ethics case consultation is a mediation servic e in which participants use a neutral third party to help work through issues that ar ise in connection with the development and adoption of a resident's care pl an or other care-related matters. The candid give and take encouraged by the mediation process includes articulating interest s, gathering facts, venting feelings, thinking creatively, cl arifying value conflicts, and finalizing agreements. LTC facilities can develop an ethics committ ee within their facility. Another option is available in Missouri. The Missouri L ong-Term Care Ombudsman Program in conjunction with Midwest Bioethics Center has developed a program called \"Long-Term Care Ethics Case Consultation\" to serve f acilities confronted by these situations. A member of the Midwest Bioethics Center provides the mediation service for these special situations. Since the incepti on of this program in the 1990s, the Center has provided numerous case consultations. _____________ 1 While these principles may provide ov erall guidance for end of life care, the work group urges long-term care facilities to consult with their legal counsel with regard to surrogate decision-making issues. Page 2 of 4 Section 2.0 Goals of Care Subsection 2.3 Advance Care Planning Issued 09/01/2003 END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Regulatory Compliance for Advance Directives The federal requirement at F156 says: \"The facility must comply with the requirements specified in subpart I of part 489 of this chapter relating to maintaining written po licies and procedures regarding advance directives. These requirements include pr ovisions to inform and provide written information to all adult residents concerni ng the right to accept or refuse medical or surgical treatment and, at the individual's op tion, formulate an advance directive. This includes a written description of the facility's policies to implement advance directives and applicable State law.\" The guidance to surveyors at 42 CFR 483.10(b )(8) provides further information. 42 CFR 489.102 specifies that upon admission of an adult resident, the facility must: provide written information concer ning his/her rights under State law (whether or not stat utory or recognized by the courts of the State) to make decisions concerning medical care, incl uding the right to accept or refuse medical or surgical treatment, and the right to formulate advance directives; document in the resident's medical reco rd whether or not the individual has executed an advance directive; not condition the provision of care or discriminate agai nst an individual based on whether or not the individual ha s executed an advance directive; ensure compliance with requirement s of State law regarding advance directives; provide for educating staff regarding th e facility's polices and procedures on advance directives; and provide for community education regard ing the right under State law (whether or not recognized by the courts of the St ate) to formulate an advance directive and the facility's written policies and procedures regarding the implementation of these rights, including any limitations the facility may have with respect to implementing this right on the basis of conscience. The facility is not required to provide care that conflicts wi th an advance directive. In addition, the facility is not required to impl ement an advance direc tive if, as a matter of conscience, the provider cannot implement an advance directive and state law allows the provider to consci entiously object. The state requirement at 19 CSR 30-88.010 (9) says: \"Prior to or upon admission and at least annually after that, each resident or guardian shall be informed of facility policies re garding provision of emergency and life- sustaining care, of an individual's right to ma ke treatment decisions for him/herself and of state laws related to advance directives fo r health-care decision making. The annual discussion may be handled either on a group or on an individual basis. Family members Page 3 of 4 Section 2.0 Goals of Care Subsection 2.3 Advanced Care Planning Issued 09/01/2003 END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 4 of 4 Section 2.0 Goals of Care Subsection 2.3 Advanced Care Planning Issued 09/01/2003 or other concerned individuals shall also be informed, upon request, regarding state laws related to advance directives for health- care decision making as well as the facility's policies regarding the provision of emergency or life-sustaining medical care or treatment. If a resident has a written advance health-care directive, a copy shall be placed in the resident's medical record and review ed annually with the resident unless, in the interval, he or she has been determined incapacitated, in accordance with Section 475.075 or 404.825, RSMo. Residents' guardians or health care attorneys-in-fact shall be contacted annually to assure their accessibilit y and understanding of the facility policies regarding emergency and life-sustaining care.\" END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 1 of 4 Section 2.0 Goals of Care Subsection 2.4 Goals of Care Issued 09/01/2003 Describing the Goals of Care A review of the literature related to LTC identifies several goal-setting categories. While some resources name only two categories, curative and palliativ e; other resources describe three categories: rest orative, maintenance, and palliative. Four treatment goals are identified in the Resident Assessment Instrument User's Manual Version 2.0. These goals include rehabilita tion, maintenance, prevention, and pa lliative care. Consistent with state law, the IDT should determine the overa ll goal of care with the resident/legal surrogate. Likewise, as the resident's condition cha nges, ongoing communication between facility staff and the resident/surrogate or family is essential so th at goals and interventions can change to address the resident's changing n eeds. The following examples describe goals of care: A resident with a recent stroke expresse s the desire to recover speech and hand functions. He wants rehabilitation goals in these areas. After he reaches these goals, the IDT will set maintenance goals to maintain this level of functioning A resident with a diagnosis of dement ia fell while walking unassisted. The fall fractured her hip. Prior to the fall, the re sident's family had requested goals to maintain her level of functioning and prevent injury. A resident in the end stages of life want s to remain free of pain and enjoy his family daily. This resident needs palliative care goals to achieve the highest practicable level of pain control and psychosocial well -being within the family circle. Residents with palliative care goals may also have goals involving interventions for rehabilitation, maintenan ce, and prevention for some aspects of their care. They may need rehabilitation for an acute injury or measures to prevent complications such as pressure ulcers. Ongoing Assessment and Care Plan Revision within the Palliative Care Goal Palliative care can be the overall goal for the resident during the end stages of life, but specific interventions will be ne eded to maintain the resident and prevent suffering. The following are examples of these specific interventions: y Assessment during the early end-of-life period \u2014 for example, a resident may choose not to eat in the dining room b ecause of fatigue and discomfort. The facility will provide the nece ssary care and services to address her nutrition needs and help her attain an appr opriate level of functioning. y Assessment throughout all stages \u2014 a resident displays pain and symptoms of depression. The facility will adequately monitor this behavior and communicate with the physician to ensure that appr opriate treatments are provided to manage these symptoms and help the resident maintain the highest quality of life. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 2 of 4 Section 2.0 Goals of Care Subsection 2.4 Goals of Care Issued 09/01/2003 y Assessment of the resident in the imminent death stage \u2014 in this stage, a resident's respirations may become sha llow and his or her mental status may deteriorate. The resident's surrogate and the IDT or other professional staff, recognizing the risks and benefits of providing nutrition and hydration, may decide to withhold food and nutrition. In th is case, the facility will provide all necessary care and services to keep the resident co mfortable and manage the symptoms that arise from l ack of nutrition and hydration. Recognizing the Need to Revise Goals Long-term care facilities serve a variety of re sidents. Some residents will spend a brief time in the facility before returning home; ot hers will spend a relatively short time in the facility prior to dying. Still others may live in the facility as their home for a number of years before they die. Setting goals of care fo r the shorter staying residents, whether for rehabilitation or palliative care, may be more obvious than setting goals for residents who will live at the facility for many years. The IDT for the resident who is slowly declining from a chronic disease must recognize the resident's clin ical condition and prognosis and discuss any significant changes in the condi tion assessment. On the basis of this assessment, the IDT can have purposeful convers ations with the resident or responsible party and set realistic goals for the resident's care. A health event (a fall, an infection, a hospitaliz ation) or the appearance of a symptom or a change in the severity of a symptom requi res a review of the care plan goals and interventions. Examples of such changes can be found in the sample care plans which are included in an appendix to this document. The Minimum Data Set (MDS) is also a useful tool in recognizing the need for changing goals. The MDS and Goal Setting The MDS is a federally required assessmen t form for documenting the resident's strengths, needs and problems. Several MDS ite ms can help staff recognize the need for decisions about goals. Section J5c. says, \"end-st age disease, 6 months to live.\" This item is the most significant to consider when making goal-changing decisions. The RAI manual gives the following coding directions: \"that in one's best clinical judgment, the resi dent with any end-stage disease has only six or fewer months to live. This judgment shoul d be substantiated by a well documented disease diagnosis and deteriorating clinical course. A doctor's certification that the resident has six months or less to live must be present in the record before coding the resident as terminal on the MDS.\" END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 3 of 4 Section 2.0 Goals of Care Subsection 2.4 Goals of Care Issued 09/01/2003 This assessment can be the beginning of a dvance care planning (if that has not already begun) and revision of the resident's care goa ls. It can also be a good marker to remind the IDT to renew its purposeful conversations w ith the resident and his or her family, so that good end-of-life care can be planned and provided. Other noteworthy MDS items that can help the facility staff recognize the need to change the goals of care include the following: y Section A10. Advance Directives y Multiple MDS items require an evaluation of a change in condition in various sections. The following items ask for the assessor to indicate a change compared to the status of the resident 90 days ago or since the last assessment. These items include: y Section B6. Change in Cognitive Status y Section C7. Change in Communication/hearing y Section E3 and E5. Change in Mood a nd Change in Behavioral symptoms y Section G9. Change in ADL Function y Section H4. Change in Urinary Continence y Section Q2. Overall Change in Care Needs y Section J1, J2, and J5. Problem Cond itions, Pain Symptoms and Stability of Condition y Section K3. Weight Change y Section M1. Pressure Ulcers y Section P1, P5, and P6. Special Tr eatments and Procedures, Hospital Stay(s), and ER Visits CMS Clarification of Significant Chan ge in Status Assessment (SCSA) The Centers For Medicare a& Medicaid Se rvices Revised Long-Term Care Resident Assessment Instrument User's Manual Version 2.0 issued December 2002 gives the following guidance: The key in determining if an SCSA is require d for individuals with a terminal condition is whether or not the change in condition is an expected well-defined part of the disease course and is consequently being addressed as part of th e overall plan of care for the individual. If a terminally ill resident experiences a new onset of symptoms or a condition that is not part of the expected course of deterioration, an SCSA is required. Similarly, if the resident enrolls in hospice (Medicare Hospice program or other structured hospice program), but remains a resident at the facility, an SCSA should be perfo rmed if the terminally ill resident experiences a new onset of symptoms or a condition that is not part of the expected course of deterioration. The facility is responsible for providing necessary care and services to assist the resident in achieving his/her highest prac ticable well-being at whatever stage of the disease process the resident is experiencing. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES If a resident elects Medicare Hospice program, it is important that the two separate entities (nursing facility and hospice program st aff) coordinate their responsibilities and develop a care plan reflecting the interventi ons required by both entities. The need to complete an SCSA will depend upon the reside nt's status at the time of election of hospice care, and whether or not the resident's condition requires a new assessment. Because a Medicare-certified hospice must also conduct an assessment at the initiation of its services, this is an appropriate time fo r the nursing facility to evaluate the MDS information to determine if it reflects the current condition of the resident. Complete an SCSA for a newly diagnosed resident with end-stage disease when: - a change is reflected in more than one area of decline; and - the resident's status will not normally resolve itself; and - the resident's status requires interdiscip linary review and/or revision of the care plan Complete subsequent SCSA's based upon th e degree of decline and the impact upon the comprehensive care plan Consider the following criteria: - completion date of the last MDS; - clinical relevancy and accuracy of the MD S to the resident's current status; and - the need to change the resident's ca re plan to reflect the current status.

Thus, 19 CSR 30-88.010(11) begins, \"Each resident shall be afforded the opportunity to participate in the planning of his/her total care and medical treatment, to refuse treatment. . . .\" Federal Regulations \u2014 Achieving the Highe st Practicable Level of Well-Being The principal regulatory direc tive in LTC is that each resi dent receives individualized care. The resident's views, values, and desires guide the go al setting and subsequent care plan interventions. The fundamental regulatory goal in long-term care is \"for the resident to receive the necessary care and services to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental and psychosocial well-bei ng in accordance with the comprehensive assessment and plan of care.\" Key words that are to be emphasized in this requirement are, \"in accordance with the comprehensive assessment and plan of care.\" This goal requires that a resident's health condition and prognosis be assessed on an ongoing basis and a plan of care developed based on this as sessment. It does not mean that regardless of the resident's condition, the facility must continue to provide rehabilitation or restorative goals. Issues of medical appropriateness and futilit y may need to be addressed. The dependency needs of end-of-life reside nts can be compared to the dependency and vulnerability of an infant. The role of the ca regiver focuses more on soft music, touching (or massage), feeding, and changing. Inst ead of providing heavy meals or rich supplements, the caregiver may offer bits of comfort food that provide pleasure such as ice cream or pudding. Instead of assisting with toileting, the use of briefs may provide greater comfort. Providing personal care to one in this stage of life demands that the caregiver be as vigilant and attentive as he or she woul d be in caring for a newborn. Factors That May Lead to Abuse and Neglect The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Se rvices (CMS) developed a training program designed to detect and preven t abuse and neglect in a vari ety of settings, including long- term care facilities. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 2 of 2 Section 2.0 Goals of Care Subsection 2.5 Regulatory Compliance Issued 09/01/2003 CMS identified \"isolation\" as a consistent pr edictor of abuse and neglect. The resident who is in the final stages of life frequently becomes very dependent on caregivers. This dependency puts the resident at increased risk for isolati on and avoidance by staff who feel inadequate or uncomforta ble dealing with the resident and/or family. Staff may fail to recognize the increased needs of the resi dent during this time and the resident may require one-on-one interactions for activ ities and social services to remain psychologically and socially involved in living. The resident's physical ability to perform self-care functions such as feeding may diminish and require a greater amount of sta ff time to meet nutrition and hydration needs. As a result of cognition and communication incapacity, the resident may become more dependent on facility staff for accurate ongoing assessment and needs fulfillment. The resident may become isolated not only becau se of cognitive and physical dependency, but also because staff may feel somewhat inadequate in dealing with a dying resident. The resident's dependency and the staff's feeli ngs of inadequacy combine to create many challenges to providing high qual ity palliative care in LTC. Avoidable Versus Unavoidable Outcomes Pressure sores, weight loss, and other physical symptoms ar e often seen in end-of-life residents, but they may also be avoida ble. The State Operations Manual (SOM) consistently directs the surveyor to obtain in formation to determine if a negative resident outcome is avoidable or unavoidable. The surv eyor will investigate whether the facility accurately assessed the resident 's needs, developed a care plan to address the needs, consistently implemented the care plan a nd had ongoing evaluation and revision of the care plan as needed to meet the needs of the resident. Throughout the regulatory investigative pr ocess and informal dispute resolution conference, the state agency must determ ine avoidable versus unavoidable outcomes. Many times the facility's defens e during the investigation or on appeal is to describe the terminal condition of the resident. This terminal condition is only one piece of information to consider in making comp liance decisions. The ongoing assessment, care plan development, and its implementation a nd revision are the additional elements that determine whether a negative outcome is avoidable or unavoidable. The care plan is sometimes inaccurately viewed simply as the care plan that is included in the resident's chart. In reality, the entire \"p lan of care\" describes the care the resident is expected to receive from all disciplines. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 1 of 1 Section 2.0 Goals of Care Subsection 2.6 Documentation Issued 09/01/2003 Documentation Purposeful observations and conversations should be documented in the resident's record. All members of the IDT should cont ribute information to help translate the resident's values and beliefs into care goals and interventi ons. Their purposeful observations and conversations need to be ongoing, fully documented and the documentation revised as needed to reflect ongoing information. The IDT should amend its instruction as often as necessary to inform direct care givers about changed interventions. All caregivers s hould know where these instructions are located and how to check for care changes. Symptoms shoul d be assessed, interventions initiated, and an evaluation of the inte rvention's success should be documented.

She is currently receiving radiation therapy for treatment of a brain tumor. Her current func tional status is ambulation with a walker to the dining room for meals and to activities of her choice. She tires easily and becomes short of breath, and requires the dire ct care staff to provide limited assistance with activiti es of daily living (ADLs). She fell several times in th e past. Her walking, standing and sitting balance is good unless she rises too quickly. She denies pain during routine assessments. She has had several conversations with her physician about her prognosis and treatment options. Mrs. Smith's daughter lives across the country and is unable to visit frequently because of her own health problems. Mrs. Smith talked with her daughter about her prognosis and treatment options and the daughter supports her decisions. Mrs. Smith's physician is admitting her to the skilled nursing facility for care. Upon admission to the skilled f acility, the Social Service Designee (SSD) asked Mrs. Smith about advance directives for healthcare. Mrs. Smith provided her with a copy of her healthcare directi ons. The SSD also discussed surrogate decision-making options permitted under state law with Mrs. Smith. The resident opted to make her daughter her attorney-in- fact through a durable power of attorney and a durable power of attorney for health care decisions. The facility filed the durable power of attorney documents in the resident's medical record. The RAI coordinator prepared for the initial care plan meeting. She talked with Mrs. Smith to determine the resident's personal goals fo r treatment in the nursing home. The RAI coordinator asked, \"what are you hoping will happen?\" The resident's response was that she wanted to get through the radiation therapy and \"be strong enough Admitted to LTC for assistance with ADLs and symptom management following radiation therapy.

Overall Goal: Mrs. Smith will return to her apartment after radiation therapy END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 2 of 4 Section 2.0 Case Study Subsection 2.7 Mrs. Smith Issued 09/01/2003 Scenario I, continued to go back to her apartment.\" The RAI coordinator talked with Mrs. Smith's physician to understand the goals for the nursing home stay. The IDT, consisting of Mrs. Smith, the RAI Coordinator, SSD, physical therapist, char ge nurse on the unit where Mrs. Smith lives, and the nurse aide who cares for her on the day shift, met to discuss the care the resident wants to receive and her goals for treatment. Since Mrs. Smith's goal was to be able to go back to her apartment and live independently after the radiation therapy, the RAI Coordinator developed a care pl an for the resident with three goals. The first goal was to maintain her present abilities while trying to in crease her conditioning; the second was to provide rehabilitation services to restore her to an independent lifesty le and the third goal was the prevention of any further falls. The SSD asked Mrs. Smith about her psychosocial a nd spiritual needs. Mrs. Smith relied heavily on her faith for support. The resident wanted continued contact with her minister and members of her church. During the radiation therapy Mrs. Smith was weak and fatigued most of the time. Therapy was scheduled three times a week for strength bu ilding activities. The nurse aides assist her with her ADL s when she needs assistance but the nurse aides understand her rehabilitation goal; they will not do the activities for her unless she asks, even though she is slow. To attain the goal of preventing falls, the nurse aide will monitor her for balance and safety when she is performing ADLs. After radiation therapy Mrs. Smith was discharged back to her apartment. Three weeks later she was readmitted to the skilled facility with weakness, falls, delirium, weight loss, and dehydration. The RAI coordinator talked with Mrs. Smith to determine \"what she hoped would happen\" with this admission.

Consiste nt with state law and her advance directive, the physic ian and nursing staff talked with her daughter and determined the goals of treatment to be for palliative care at this time. Over the next two weeks Mrs. Smith had intermittent confusion and periods of extreme agitation. The nursing staff identified the periods of agitation and relieved them with pain medication. A pain medication was ordered on a regular basis with other pain meds for breakthrough pain as evidenced by increased agit ation. A mild sedative was also ordered for increased agitation. The RAI Coordinator had conversations with Mrs. Smith and phone conversations with her daughter frequently during these weeks. Within a few weeks, Mrs. Smith began sleeping more and refused to eat. She began having longer periods of delirium. The RAI Coordinator and the SSD had frequent phone conversations with her daughter to inform her of her mother's condition and obtain direction about treatment decisions. The IDT me t to discuss the decreased need and desire for food as a part of the dying process. Staff members were instructed to offer foods and fluids, but not to force, or give a nything orally to Mrs Smith if she was not alert. The care plan was updated frequently due to her rapidly de clining condition. The SSD provided emotional support and guided the direct care staff in meeting Mrs. Smith's emotional needs. The SSD talked with the resident's minister and someone from the congregation visited daily. She discussed funeral arrangements with the daughter. Mrs. Smith's level of consci ousness continued to change until she was unable to communicate verbally. Her breathing patterns changed and oxygen was ordered per nasal canula.

END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 1 of 2 Section 3.0 Pain Management Subsection 3.2 Introduction Issued 09/01/2003 Introduction \u2014 Responsibility for Effective Pain Relief Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotiona l experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage. However, a more clin ically applicable definition is that of McCaffery and Beebe (1989), who st ate that pain is wh at the patient says it is. It should always be regarded as totally subjective (i .e., defined by the person experiencing it). In the LTC setting, residents do not always verba lize their pain but w ill express it in other ways. Residents in LTC facilities often suffer acute and chronic painful diseases, have multiple diseases, and take many medications. They ma y have more than one source of pain and an increased risk for interactions between dr ugs and interactions be tween the drugs they take and other diseases. Pain is common at the end of life as a result of arthritis, circulatory disorders, immobility, neuropathy, cancer, and other age-related conditions. Everyone experiences pain differently. Pain cannot be measured like blood pressure or temperature; we must rely on the resident's description of pain. Pain assessment may present unique problems in elderly residents. Older residents often report pain very differently from younger residents because there are physiologic, psychological, and cultural cha nges associated with aging. The institutiona lized elderly are often stoic about pain. LTC facilities have the additional challenge of determining signs and symptoms of pain for residents who cannot communicate verbally \u2014 perhaps because of dementia or other conditions. One person's report of severe pain may feel like almost nothing to another. The caregiver's challenge is to assess all potential factors relevant to the resident's pain status without imposing personal biases. According to pain experts, the resident's self -report or feeling of pain is the single most reliable indicator of pain. Pain should not be accepted as something the resident \"just has to live with.\" All LTC staff and the resident's family share in the role of evaluating and managing the resident's pain. The direct careg ivers, activities director, social workers, and housekeeping and dietary staff frequently spend the greatest amount of time with the resident. Doctors and charge nurses usually control the dose and frequency of pain medication, but they don't see the resident as often as their colleagues do. A resident may appear pain free when lying still, but caregiver s see the resident's pain when he or she is moving or during ADLs. The caregiver must report this information to the charge nurse. It is important for everyone caring for th e resident to understand the importance of recognizing and reporting pain. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 2 of 2 Section 3.0 Pain Management Subsection 3.2 Introduction Issued 09/01/2003 The process of pain management in the facility begins with an affi rmation that residents should have access to the best level of pain re lief that may safely be provided. In any LTC facility, the quality of pain control will be influenced by the availability of a pain management program and the training, expert ise, and experience of its members. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 1 of 2 Section 3.0 Pain Management Subsection 3.3 Common Misconception about Pain Issued 09/01/2003 Common Misconceptions about Pain One of the most common misconceptions abou t pain has already been mentioned \u2014 the best judge of pain is not th e person caring for the resident. The resident \u2014 the person in pain \u2014 knows pain the best. Other misconcep tions and realities about pain management include the following: Misconception : The caregiver is th e best judge of pain. Reality: The resident knows best about pa in he or she is feeling. Pain is whatever the resident says it is. Misconception: A person with pain will always have obvious signs such as moaning, abnormal vital signs, or not eating Reality: Persons adapt to chronic pain, and do not always show outward signs. A resident may watch televisi on as a distraction from pai n, or go to sleep to escape pain. Vital sign abnormalities are not always an indicator of pain. Misconception : Pain is a normal part of aging. Reality : Elderly residents may not report their pain because they believe that pain is a natural part of aging. Pain is comm on in many chronic diseases, but it is not inevitable with aging. Analgesic medicat ions can be used appropriately and effectively even in the very elderly to re lieve suffering and enhance quality of life. Misconception: Addiction is common when opioid medications are prescribed. Reality : Addiction is very rare in patients who take opioid medications for pain; in fact, it occurs less than one time in 1,000 cases. Misconceptions: Morphine and other strong pain relievers should be reserved for the late stages of dying. Reality: Severe pain at any st age of life may require strong pain medications to give relief. Morphine and other medicati ons do not have to be \"saved for when the resident really needs it.\" Most reside nts' pain can be eas ily controlled with oral medications over time, and tolera nce is not usually a problem. If the resident's need for pain medications increases, the increase is usually an indication that the disease is progressing, not a sign that the resident is developing a tolerance for drugs. There is no ceiling or maximal daily dose for morphine and other opioids. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 2 of 2 Section 3.0 Pain Management Subsection 3.3 Common Misconception about Pain Issued 09/01/2003 Misconception : Morphine and other opioids can easily cause lethal respiratory depression. Reality : Opioids should be started at low dos es and titrated upward to control a resident's pain. If the pain is intense or the resident has a tolerance for these medications, the necessary doses may be quite high. A resident who has been taking opioids can tolerate significant dose increases if the pain remains severe. Misconception: Pain medications should be given only after the resident develops pain. Reality : A steady state of pain control is th e desired goal. Pain control is much easier and more consistent if medica tions are given before the resident experiences pain. A resident should not ha ve to \"earn\" his or her pain medication by experiencing pain. Misconception : Anxiety always makes pain worse. Truth : Anxiety and pain often go together , but it is not known if anxiety can cause pain. We do know, however, th at pain often causes anxiety.

The information in the following two tables will help staff understand pain by its duration and type. Table 1.\u2014Categories of Pain by Duration Acute Pain Chronic Cancer Pain Chronic Non- Malignant Pain Duration Brief, goes away with healing (Usually 6 months or less) Pain is expected to have an end, with cure or with death No predictable ending Key Reminders Acute pain is not necessarily more severe than chronic pain Acute pain may be slow in onset. Examples are broken bones, strep throat, and pain after surgery Aggressive treatment recommended Addiction not a concern Difficult to find specific cause Often can't be cured Frequently undertreated When a resident becomes a hospice patient , the hospice team may take a different approach to treating chronic, nonmalignant pain. This pain now has a predictable ending, the patient's death. Pain control is always important, but especially important when residents are trying to maintain quality of life as they face the end of their lives.

Sample tools are provided in the appendixes to this document. Of course, as king about pain is an important part of any assessment. In the past , asking about pain was not done routinely. Some caregivers feared that aski ng about pain would put the idea of pain in the resident's mind. Others were unsure about what they w ould do if their questions elicited a pain report. It is, however, the res ponsibility of everyone caring fo r the resident to report pain. The charge nurse is then respons ible to further assess the repo rts of pain from all sources, including the family, direct ca regivers, clergy, or other facil ity staff, and obtain treatment orders. Assessments to identify and treat pain must be ongoing. Elde rly residents require frequent monitoring. Monitoring may have ma jor implications for quality assurance, quality of care, and quality of life among this population of residents. Assessing Pain in Residents with De mentia or Communication Difficulties The resident's report of pain is the best method for assessing pain but sometimes the resident is unable to report pain. Residents with dementia or other cognitive disabilities will have difficulty communicating their pain symptoms. Facility staff should consider the followi ng guidelines when assessing residents with dementia or communication problems: Ask the resident if he or she is having pain . You might be surprised at the resident's level of understanding and response. Residents with significant cognitive impairment can often understa nd a simple question about pain and respond to the caregiver. You might want to use a term other than the word \"pain.\" Try using hurt, discomfort, unc omfortable, aching, or soreness. The assessor should ask concrete questions rather than abstract questions. For example, an abstract question is \"are you having pain?\" A concrete question might be, \"does your arm hurt?\" Or, \" does your back ache?\" Residents with cognitive impairment will need to be assessed in the present moment. They will not remember past pain. It must be frequently assessed on an ongoing basis. Consider the disease condition and procedures that may be causing pain . A skin tear on the leg from the wheelchai r's rough edge, a fractured hip, a fall that results in a bruise on the elbow , physical therapy goals for ambulation daily following a hip fracture are among likely reasons for pain treatment. It may help caregivers to think, \"if I were that resident, would I want something for pain?\" END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Use proxy pain reporting . Families often report to the nurse that their loved one is in pain. Housekeepers, the mainte nance person, social workers, activity aides, and dietary staff are often exte nded family who observe and interact with the resident frequen tly throughout the day. They should be encouraged to report the resi dent's pain. Be alert for behaviors that may indicate pain . Actions speak louder than words when residents are in pain. Pa y particular attention to physical aggression, verbal aggressi on, facial expressions, rest lessness, and resistance to caregivers. When implementing a fac ility behavior inte rvention program, start with considering the pain assessme nt of each resident. The following list of actions may represent pain. Facial expressions : frown, grimace, fearful, sad, teeth clenched, eyes wide open or shut tight Physical movements : restless, fidgeting, absen ce of movement, slow or cautious movements, guarding, rocki ng, rigidity, rubbing, holding parts of body, wandering Vocalizations : groaning, moaning, repeated phrases, yelling out, noisy breathing Social : sleepless or sleeping most of the time, irritability, agitated, combative, crying, trying to get attent ion, refusal to go to activities, loss of appetite, withdrawn, resist care Aggression : physical or verbal Page 2 of 2 Section 3.0 Pain Management Subsection 3.6 Pain Assessment Issued 09/01/2003 END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 1 of 5 Section 3.0 Pain Management Subsection 3.7 Treatment of Pain Issued 09/01/2003 Treatment of Pain Rules of Thumb These common sense rules can help guide LTC staff in decision-making for effective pain management: Use the lowest effective dose by th e simplest (e.g., oral) route Start with the simplest single agent, a nd maximize its potential before adding other drugs. If combinati on therapy is necessary, use adjuvant (i.e., additional) medication to increase effectiveness. Use scheduled, long-acting pain medicati ons for constant or frequent pain, with prn, short-acting medication available for breakthrough pain. Treat breakthrough pain with one-thi rd the 12 hour scheduled dose. If three or more prn doses are used in a day, increase the scheduled dose. Increase the dose by one-fourth to one-ha lf of the prior dosage. Remember to consider increasing the prn dose wh en you increase the scheduled dose. Be vigilant at assessing th e side effects of medicati ons. Treat or prevent side effects, such as constipation and nausea. Change medication as necessary. Use the World Health Organization's (W HO's) step-wise approach, which is also called the WHO Analgesic Ladder. Reevaluate and adjust medications at regular intervals and as necessary. Do not stop pain medications in terminal patients. Change the route if needed. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 2 of 5 Section 3.0 Pain Management Subsection 3.7 Treatment of Pain Issued 09/01/2003 The World Health Organizatio n (WHO) Analgesic Ladder Severity of Pain Drugs Reminders Adjuvant Therapy Acetaminophen \u2014 e.g., Tylenol . Good relief of simple pain, easily available, few side effects Elderly patients should have no more than 2.5 - 4 grams per day. Can be toxic to the liver Mild NSAIDS or Non-Steroidal Anti- Inflammatory Naproxen wide variety of pain, anti-inflammatory, esp. good for bone and joint pain. Look for GI upset, use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders. May exacerbate congestive heart failure or renal failure. Moderate Combination Analgesics . Preferred choices are mixtures (Tylenol #3 ) are not recommended because they produce more side effects with less pain relief. Most combination drugs have acetaminophen. Remember to keep the 24 hour dose of acetaminophen less than 4 grams per day. Severe Opioids . Morphine: Flexible dosing, short and long acting doses, inexpensive. Quick acting concentrated liquid morphine, e.g., Roxanol can be given to patients having difficulty swallowing, and may also be helpful for breathing discomfort . Oxycodone: Short and long acting doses can be given to residents who had confusion with morphine. This drug is very expensive. Fentanyl ( Duragesic ) : Convenient when given as a 72 hour patch, but expensive, absorption varies depending on body fat, and you can't change doses quickly due to slow peak effect. Slow breathing and sedation usually go away in 1 or 2 days after beginning medications or increasing dose. Patients should be on laxatives with any opioid. Increase laxative doses when pain doses are increased. Do not crush long acting opioids ( MS Contin, Oxycontin ) Less than 1% of people taking opioids become addicted, but most do develop a tolerance so doses may need to be increased. Adjuvant means in addition to. The use of adjuvant medications or therapies can be used with any severity of pain, and their use is determined by the type of pain. Medications: Bone pain \u2014 NSAIDS. Nerve or (Prednisone, Dexamethasone ). Pain associated Ativan ) or alprazolam (Xanax therapy, heat, ice, local balms, massage, comfortable atmosphere, Metastron (used for bone pain-given by radiation oncologist) END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 3 of 5 Section 3.0 Pain Management Subsection 3.7 Treatment of Pain Issued 09/01/2003 Pain Management in the Elderly Elderly residents present several pain manage ment problems. First, relatively little attention has been paid to the topic of geriat ric pain control in me dical or nursing texts. This inattention is ironic because elderly pe ople often suffer acute and chronic painful diseases, have multiple diseases, and take many medications. They may have more than one source of pain and an increased risk for drug-drug as well as drug-disease interactions. It has been estimated from populat ion studies that the pr evalence of pain is two-fold higher in those over age 60. More than 80 percent of elderly people suffer various forms of arthritis, and most will have acute pain at some time. Second, pain assessment may present unique prob lems in elderly residents. They often report pain very differently from younger residents because of physiologic, psychological, and cultural changes associated with aging. Institutionalized elderly are often stoic about pain. Cognitive impairment, delirium, and dementia represent serious barriers to pain assessment. Preliminary reports from ongoing work among the nursing home population suggest that many residents with moderate to severe cognitive impairment are able to report acute pain reliably at the moment or when prompte d, although their pain recall and integration of pain experience over time may be less reliable. Opioid Use in the Elderly Educating staff is essential for good pain mana gement. Opioid analgesics are effective for relieving moderate to severe pain. Studies in dicate that opioids of equal potency produce higher plasma concentrations in older person s. The evidence shows a greater sensitivity to opioids in older persons, especially opioi d-na\u00efve residents, in both analgesic properties and side effects. Smaller starting doses of opioids are required to avoid increased side effects and toxic reactions. When selecting opioids for older residents, consider the duration of action, formulation availability, side-effect profile , and resident preference. Wh en prescribing opioids for a resident with no history of narcotic use, re view the resident's dr ug regimen for possible drug interactions. Older persons may have fluc tuating pain levels re quiring rapid titration or frequent use of breakthrough medication. Lo ng-acting opioids are generally suitable for residents once steady pain levels are achie ved; occasionally a resident in severe pain can be started on low-dose sustained release opioids. Once achieved, controlled-release formulations of dihydr omorphone, or fentanyl can be used. Fentanyl patches should not be placed on areas of the resident's body that may receive END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 4 of 5 Section 3.0 Pain Management Subsection 3.7 Treatment of Pain Issued 09/01/2003 excessive heat (such as on the back of a bedf ast resident) as that can affect the absorption of the patches. In addition, these patches may be contraindicated for residents with exceptionally low body fat. Pain Management Risk for LTC Residents Frail and elderly residents ar e at particular risk for bot h under- and over-treatment of pain. Age-related changes in the resident can contribute to a variety of adverse drug effects that have been reported. Non-opioi d analgesic drugs, including NSAIDs and acetaminophen, are effective and appropriate for a variety of pain complaints. However, it is recognized that the risk for gastric a nd renal toxicity from NSAIDs is increased among elderly residents, and unusual drug re actions including cognitive impairment, constipation, and headaches are also more common in the elderly population. Facility staff should be aware of drug side effects. All members of the IDT should be aware of all possible side e ffects and monitor the resident for their occurrences. The pharmacist is a key member of the team for recognizing and co mmunicating the side effects to facility staff. The facility n eeds an ongoing method for communicating the drug side effects to all staff. The care plan c ould be one communication method for staff to know the adverse drug reactions. What Everyone Can Do to Manage Pain It is the role of the docto rs, nurse, therapist, and family to determine the medical treatment for pain. Treatment may include medication, whirlpools, braces, ultrasound, or massages. But there are important things that everyone can do: Show that you care. A kind reassuring word and a soft touch go a long way. Let the resident know what you are going to do, even if he or she doesn't understand. Talk to, not around, the resident. Remember h earing is the last sense to go. Make the room pleasant. A comfortable temp erature, soft lighting, soft music, and noise control can all increase pain tolerance. Take care of the basics. Repositioning, gla sses and hearing aides, dry clothes, a comfortable bed or chair, to ileting, food and fluids are of ten more important to the resident than any pill. Communicate with your team. Let others know what works best for the resident. Always report pain to the ch arge nurse or team. Pain is not a normal part of aging and all residents should ha ve their pain managed. Understand the care plan for pain. Not all pain can be cured, but it can be treated in a thought out, effective fashion. A care pl an for any resident with problem pain should involve a team approach. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 5 of 5 Section 3.0 Pain Management Subsection 3.7 Treatment of Pain Issued 09/01/2003 Relaxation methods can include a variety of techniques to help decrease anxiety and muscle tension; for example, imag ery, distraction, and progressive muscle relaxation. Tactile strategies, for example, str oking and massage, can provide comfort through the sense of touch. Music and art therapy, meditation, and ot her relaxation techniques can be very helpful. Don't forget the team. Physical therapy can help with mobility and safety issues. Occupational therapy can help with difficult positioning and splints.

The World Health Organization defines Palliative Ca re as the \"active total care of patients whose disease is not responsive to curative treatment. . . .\" For WHO, the goal of palliative care is to achieve \"the best quality of life for patients and their families.\" The Medicare Hospice benefit encourages defining the end-of-life by a timeframe of six months or less to live. What guidelines do we have for meeting nut rition and hydration goals within that timeframe? The regulatory requirement for the resident to achieve the highest level of well-being in accordance with the comprehens ive assessment and plan of care applies to any resident at any time during his or her stay at the long-term care f acility. The assessment and plan of care depends on what the resident/surrogate wishes to achieve for each change in a symptom complex. As the resident's strength and communication skil ls decline, his or her dependency on facility staff will likely incr ease. Providing individualized care will often require increased staff or family time to meet the resident's nutrition and hydration needs. For example, the room-bound resident may require more one-on-one help with feeding. Engaging the resident's family and friends can be important in meeting the resident's nutrition and hydration needs. Th e facility should alwa ys consider current standards of medical practice in pr oviding comfort to the resident. Appropriate Nutrition and Hydration Goals The primary goal of nutrition and hydration in terminal illness is resident comfort: improving quality of life by giving the resi dent maximum enjoyment from eating. Another goal is to maintain the resident's nutritional status or op timize the resident's intake. These goals can be difficult to balance in the long-term care facility. A facility can help achieve this balance by identifying foods the resident tolerates and desires. LTC staff should provide these foods as often as possible whenever the re sident requests them. These foods provide nutrition, hydration, and comfor t to the resident. The facility that can respond to the resident's requests is providi ng the highest practicab le level of nutrition and hydration for the resident's well-being in accordance with the comprehensive assessment and plan of care. A resident's nutritional needs change as his or her illness advances. Allowing the resident/legal surrogate as much control as possible is the best way to maximize the resident's intake while minimizing discomfo rt. The IDT can assist this effort. For END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURING FACILITIES Page 2 of 3 Section 4.0 Nutrition and Hydration Subsection 4.2 Nutrition and Hydr ation in Accordance with the Comprehensive Assessment and Plan of Care Issued 09/01/2003 example, one of the primary functions of th e team is to communicate with the family. The team should designate a staff person to communicate with and support the family and thereby help the facility unde rstand and implement the resi dent's wishes. Comfort and diminished distress from sympto ms should be the goals of any intervention. As the illness advances, food and hydration can cause distress. The appropriate time for the IDT to contribute it s expertise to the resident's care in this matter is during assessment of significant change that points to a re vision of care plan goals. Team members will include the following: Registered Dietician (RD) . The dietician should work closely with the resident and family regarding the reside nt's likes, dislikes, cravi ngs for, and intolerance of certain foods. This information will assi st the RD in making menu changes or recommending the best supplements to maximize the resident's nutritional intake. Menu changes can include offering high prot ein, high caloric foods, such as eggs, milkshakes, custard, and peanut butter. If the resident doesn't tolerate meat, eggs, cheese or beans for protein, the RD ma y recommend adding powdered nutritional supplement to other foods to increase nut ritional value. Alcoholic drinks, if medically allowed, can be enjoyable fo r the resident while stimulating the appetite. The team should encourage the fa mily to bring the resident's favorite foods from home. A variety of options s hould be tried to maximize the resident's enjoyment of food and nutritional intake. Dietary Manager . This IDT member is an important link between the nursing department and the dietary department. The dietary manager should establish a system for receiving the physician's orders and dietary recommendations, and for ensuring that the dietary department prep ares and delivers the food to the nursing department. Often the dietary manager is responsible for making the RD's recommendations available to th e physician for consideration. Occupational Therapist (OT) . This member can assess the resident's needs for assistive devices, including the use of a straw, sippy cup, nosey cup, built up utensils, plate guards, or other implements. Physical Therapist (PT) . PTs can recommend positioning for optimum comfort and safe intake of food and liquid. Proper positioning can make the difference between safe swallowing and choking or aspiration. It may also make the difference between optimal intake and poor intake resulting from weakness, fatigue, or pain. Charge Nurse . Nurses should observe the resident at frequent intervals or assist the resident frequently to evaluate the amount of assist ance the resident needs at the current time. The resident may need supervision, cueing, limited assistance, extensive assistance or total assistance. The charge nurse should direct the caregiver in the amount of assistance n eeded at each meal. The charge nurse should evaluate the resident's chewing and swallowing safety at each meal. Assessing the resident's use of dentures is important to prevent the dentures from END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURING FACILITIES Page 3 of 3 Section 4.0 Nutrition and Hydration Subsection 4.2 Nutrition and Hydr ation in Accordance with the Comprehensive Assessment and Plan of Care Issued 09/01/2003 becoming a hindrance to the resident's ab ility to eat. Providing good and frequent oral care to the resident can also increase the reside nt's appetite. Communicating changes in the resident's condition and the RD's and OT's recommendations is often the charge nur se's responsibility. Nurse Assistant (NA) . The nursing assistant should help the resident get into the correct position for eating a nd drinking, acquire the appropriate adaptive utensils, including vision glasses a nd dentures, and provide the appropriate amount of assistance needed. Cleansing the mouth a nd teeth frequently can increase the resident's appetite. NAs should help ma ke the atmosphere and food presentation pleasant and remove excess food as soon as the resident has eaten all that he or she desires. The staff should provide f ood whenever the resident is hungry, not just at mealtime. RAI/MDS Coordinator . These coordinators should direct the completion of an accurate assessment, help develop the car e plan with other team members, and ensure that the plan is communicated to all staff on all shifts involved in the resident's care. The resident's condition w ill change frequently at the end stages. These changes should be reflected on an on- going basis in the resident's plan of care. Daily and hourly changes should be addressed in the inte rdisciplinary notes and communicated to all staff. Pharmacist . The pharmacist should work closely with the facility staff regarding review of the resident's drug regimen wh en the goals of care are palliative. The pharmacist needs to remain informed of th e care goals so that he or she can make appropriate recommendations. Recommendati ons should be made to the physician regarding the adverse effect s of the resident's medications. The pharmacist should review the medications to ensure the me dications are not adversely affecting the resident's appetite. Decisions to discon tinue medications should be made by the physician after discussion with the IDT. Physicians . The doctor should review the curr ent plan of care and modify existing physician orders th at conflict with the pal liative care goal. Dietary restrictions should be le ssened unless doing so woul d cause immediate harm or discomfort. The physician, pharmacist, and nurse should review the drug regimen to ensure it does not affect the appe tite and is not causing discomfort. Inappropriate Nutrition and Hydration Goals Traditional goals of a balanced diet and achieving an ideal weight are not realistic or appropriate in end stages of life. Traditional di ets that restrict salt, cholesterol, or sugar may no longer be appropriate unless the resident prefers th e restrictions. Side effects rarely occur because amounts of sodium, sugar, and calories are self-restricted. The goal is to provide foods the resident wants and w ill eat. Educating family about the resident's changing nutritional needs is part of the staff's responsibility.

The facility should evaluate interventions with that goal in mind as the resident's condition changes over time. Interventions fo r residents in end of life will be highly individualized. Standardized ca re plans or a \"one size fits all\" approach is not going to work. The \"end-of-life stage\" is such a broa d category, and the resi dent's needs are so different that most authors refer to the last days or week of life as \"imminent death.\" A nutrition and hydration interventi on that brings comfort at an early stage of end-of-life can cause distress at a late st age of end-of-life. Therefore, the resident's care must be based on the comprehensive assessment and wish es of the resident. LTC staff must also attend to the manner in which food is provi ded. The resident may like the comfort and enjoyment of food but not like being fed in a hurried manner or in amounts that he or she can't handle safely. The professi onal staff must be aware of a ll aspects of the delivery of care and instruct, direct, and redirect caregiver s who assist dependent residents with their nutritional needs. Food and Hydration as Comfort The nutrition and hydration goal is to optimi ze intake, provide pleasure, and promote comfort measures. The resident who is serious ly ill usually cannot eat very much without feeling full or satisfied. The car egiver should offer frequent, smaller feedings to optimize intake and keep the resident more comfortable. Food and Hydration as Distress Often in the late stages, bodily systems fail, and the resident is unable to metabolize food normally. The disease process decreases the re sident's energy levels and changes eating from a pleasant experience to a distressing one. Food cravings can change from one moment to the next, with the resident reques ting food, then rejecting it after eating only a bite or two. The process of shutting down normal bodily functions is natural; it is not starvation. It is normal to have no thirst or hunger and to refu se all intake when death is imminent. The dying resident should never be made to feel guilty for not trying to eat. Even if the resident wants to eat, he or sh e may be unable to do so. Forcing one to accept food and fluid can increase ra ther than alleviate distre ss. The dying process may be prolonged by a few days with food and flui ds, but such intake does not improve the quality of remaining life. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURING FACILITIES Page 2 of 2 Section 4.0 Nutrition and Hydration Subsection 4.3 Comfort Versus Distress Issued 09/01/2003 Lack of Food and Hydration as Comfort Gradual dehydration appears to be the body' s way of preventing distressing symptoms, such as lung congestion, shortness of breat h, rattling secretions (death rattle), vomiting, and edema. Decreased output means less need for a bedpan, urinal, commode, or catheter. Dehydration is not a painful process and has even been described as causing a euphoric effect. The production of natural analgesics (endorphins) helps the body perceive that suffering has decreased. Lack of Food and Hydration as Distress Lack of food and hydration will cause the sk in and mucous membranes to dry out which, if not cared for, will cause distress. However, this effect can be managed. A dry mouth and lips can lead to painful cracking, swe lling, and oral infections. Assessment and interventions to minimize distressing compli cations of the dying process must be an active continuous process.

The follo wing guidance is from the State Operations Manual, A ppendix P, investigative protocol : \"If a resident is at an end of life stage and has an advance dire ctive, according to State law, (or decision has been ma de by the resident's surrogate or representative, in accordance with State law) or the resident has reached an end of life stage in which minimal amounts of nut rients [fluids] are being consumed or intake has ceased, and all appropriate e fforts have been made to encourage and provide intake, then weight loss [dehydrat ion] may be an expected outcome and does not constitute non-compliance w ith the requirement for nutritional [hydration] parameters. Conduct observa tions to verify that palliative interventions, as described in the plan of care, are being implemented and revised as necessary, to meet the needs/choices of the resident in order to maintain the resident's comfort and quality of life. If the facility has failed to provide the palliative care, cite non-compliance w ith 42 CFR 483.25, F309, Quality of Care.\" END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURING FACILITIES END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURING FACILITIES Page 1 of 1 Section 4.0 Nutrition and Hydration Subsection 4.5 Medications Issued 09/01/2003 Medications Medications can decrease and stimulate the appetite. Care givers should consult the resident's physician and pharm acist to assess what medica tions should be part of the resident's drug regimen and whether any medica tions may be hindering oral intake. First, all medications should be reviewed to ensure that they are necessary given the resident's changing condition. Then medications that might improve appetite can be considered. If a medication is used to stimulate the appetite, the resident's response to the drug should be monitored and its effectiveness evaluated on an on-going basis. Staff should know how to recognize side effects and inte rdisciplinary reviews of a ll care including medications should be a regular part of the resident's care. Below are some commonly used medicat ions available to improve appetite. Steroids . These drugs have been used to reduce inflammation and pain, reduce nausea, and stimulate intake. They are most commonly used in cancer patients, but can be tried cautiously in other residents. The side effects from these drugs may negate the drug benefit for some patients. Megace (megestrol) . Megace has been used with some success to stimulate appetite. The therapeutic response isn't immediate. If confusion is provoked by drug by-product retention, a tr ial of parenteral hydrati on may be appropriate to relieve confusion. Periactin (cyproheptadine) . This medication has been used to improve appetite, but the evidence is anecdotal; it has not b een well studied in terminal illnesses. Side effects can include sedation and confusion. Remeron ( mirtazapine ). Remeron is a unique antidepressant, which at lower doses can stimulate appetite and help cont rol neuropathic pain. This drug may be sedating. Other antidepressants can be tr ied if anorexia is based primarily on depression and not other physiologic causes. Marinol (dronabinol) . Marinol is approved for use in AIDS patients and has been used by some physicians to treat elderly re sidents. Its use is controversial because it can lead to multiple Central Nervous System effects. Pain control medications . Pain control medications that affect the residents comfort level may also help them take in more nourishment. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURING FACILITIES END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURING FACILITIES Page 1 of 2 Section 4.0 Nutrition and Hydration Subsection 4.6 Enteral Feedings The resident/legal surrogate ha s option of choosing parent eral or enteral feedings. Hospice nurses report the difficulty many families have in making decisions about artificial nutrition or hydrati on (whether it is implementing this intervention or withholding existing nutrition). The physician and/or facility staff needs to spend time talking with the family about the benefits and burdens of parenteral and enteral feedings. Residents receiving tube feedi ngs need special consideratio ns to optimize the benefits and minimize complications. Tube feedings may play a specialized role in head and neck or esophageal cancers. With these diseases the resident loses the ability to swallow safely relatively early in the dying pr ocess. Other considerations al so relate to the negative effects of tube feedings. These interventions are associated with a high incidence of aspiration, self-removal, restra ints, and symptoms such as nausea, rattling pulmonary secretions, and diarrhea. Thes e problems may result from the failure of the kidneys or gastrointestinal systems. At th e end of life, the gastrointestinal system fails to absorb food. This can result in the resident's con tinued weight loss, abnormal lab values and pressure sore development or failure to heal. Potential fluid overload and discomfort beco me highly likely with multi-system organ failure at the end of life. Artificially give n fluids may hasten and aggravate the dying process, and not comfort the resident. In case of doubt about the role of dehydration in a particular resident, a short trial of rehydration may be appropriate, al lowing an assessment of its c linical impact and benefit. Sometimes mental confusion is provoked from drug by-product retent ion and a trial of parental hydration may be appropriate. Regulatory Compliance in the Use of Feeding Tubes Decisions revolving around the placement of feeding tubes are fre quently difficult for facility staff who struggle with regulatory compliance. The federal regulation 42 CFR 483.25(g), (F321) for nasogastric tube s gives the following direction: \"Based on the comprehensiv e assessment of a resident, the fac ility must ensure that a resident who has been able to eat enough alone or w ith assistance is not fed by naso-gastric tube unless the resident's clinical condition demonstr ates that use of a naso-gastric tube was unavoidable.\" The Guidance to Surveyors Section states: the intent of this regulat ion is that a naso- gastric tube feeding is utilized only after ade quate assessment, and the resident's clinical condition makes this treatment necessary.\" This requirement is \"intended to prevent the END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURING FACILITIES Page 2 of 2 Section 4.0 Nutrition and Hydration Subsection 4.6 Parenter al and Enteral Feedings Issued 09/01/2003 use of tube feeding when ordered over the objections of the resident. Decisions about the appropriateness of tube feeding for a resi dent are developed with the resident or his/her family, surrogate or representative as part of determining the care plan.\" The Resident Assessment Protocol: Feeding Tubes states the following in its statement of the problem: \"Where residents have difficulty eating a nd staff have limited time to assist them, insertion of feeding tubes for the convenience of nursing staff is an unacceptable rational for use.\" The RAP gives further directions by saying, \"Assure informed consent and right to refuse treatment. Informed consen t is essential before inserting a nasogastric or nasointestinal tube. Potential advantages , disadvantages, and potential complications need to be discussed. Resident preference is normally given the greatest weight in decisions regarding tube feeding. State laws and judicial decisions must also be taken into account. In any case, when illness is termin al and/or irreversible, technical means of providing fluids a nd nutrition can represent extraordinary rather than ordinary means of prolonging life.\" 1 1 While these principles may provide overall guidance for end of life care, the work group urges long-term care facilities to consult with their legal counsel with regard to surrogate decision-making issues. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURING FACILITIES Page 1 of 2 Section 4.0 Nutrition and Hydration Subsection 4.7 Family Attitudes Issued 09/01/2003 Family Attitudes In our society, eating and drinki ng together or giving food and drink is a symbolic gesture of giving love. The sharing of food is almost always associated with social events and celebrations. When a relative enters the dyi ng stage of life, the family should be encouraged to understand that refusing food is not a rejection of thei r love. This concept of food as a symbol of love can make it diffi cult for caregivers and family to accept the resident's decrease in food consumption duri ng the dying process. The resident in the imminent death phase often accepts, even welcomes, not being pressured to eat. But family and caregivers may have difficulty a ccepting the resident's refusal of food and fluid. Staff should explain the decreasing desire for food and fluid during the end of life and the comfort and distress associated with it. It is important to help the family refocus its energy into nourishing the loved one's emo tional relationships. Encourage the family to replace their desires to provide nourish ment and nurturing for the body by providing nourishment and nurturing for the mind and spirit. During the end of life, the resident is not th e only person who may need help. The family must also cope with the emotional and ps ychological aspects of their loved one's condition. The facility staff needs to expand their assessment to include the needs of family members. Often families don't know how to act when the resident can no longer carry on a conversation. For example, a wife who visited her husband after he had suffered a stroke, had no rehab goals, and was unresponsive, said to the nurse : \"I don't know what to do in there.\" After all the usual responses in su ch situations, the nurse as ked her what her husband had enjoyed doing before he had the stroke. The woman said that he had loved sports and always read every word in the sports secti on of the paper. The nurse suggested she read some of the paper to him. This suggestion ga ve the wife a sense of direction, and she was delighted. Bringing the paper to her hu sband gave purpose to her visits. Often the family is at a loss for something to do when they can no longer offer food or fluids. The facility staff can suggest activit ies that family members can do during their time at the bedside, including, for example, applying lotion to hands and feet, giving a back massage, applying moisturizer to the lips, remembering earlier times and happeni ngs that bring back good memories, playing audiotapes with nature sounds and appropriate music. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURING FACILITIES Page 2 of 2 Section 4.0 Nutrition and Hydration Subsection 4.7 Family Attitudes Issued 09/01/2003 talking about past life me mories and experiences sitting in silence and sharing the time Facility Staff Becomes Like Family The facility's professional staff should be aw are of one another's emotional attachment to these residents. This emotional attachment is the caring quality that allows us to show love and concern for one another. Often the f acility staff becomes a surrogate family to the resident. This caring quality needs to be nurtured, and staff, too, should go through a healthy grieving process when the residents they care for enter the last stages of life. Such a process will help them express these same caring emotions time after time as residents die at the facility. In one facility, for example, a resident lived for many years with no family or friends to visit him. His diagnosis was Huntington's C horea, which made it considerably difficult for him to eat or for staff to feed him. One nurse aide had developed an emotional attachment to him and was his most successful caregiver. She could always get him to eat with the least amount of diffi culty and the most enjoyment for both the resident and the nurse aide. When he died, the Director of Nurses recognized the aide's grief. The DON talked with the administrator about it, and the facility held a memorial service for the resident. Staff purchased a willow sapling (t he resident's favorite tree), and everyone helped the nurse aide plant the tree in memory of the resident. LTC facilities can develop a network of re sources within their community who can provide grief counseling for their staff a nd families. The administrative staff should monitor the needs of staff and families so that all aspects of the death and grieving process are addressed in a healthy manne r. During this time, everyone needs good memories and support as they deal with the difficult situations of living and helping others during their time of dying.

Nursing home staff members are not professional clergy or psychologists, but they can recognize these needs and provide appr opriate interventions. The interventions can be divi ded into two kinds: staff can listen to a person's life review; and they can seek professional assistance for the resident through referrals for more intensive psychosocial and spir itual care. Under state and federal regulations, nursing homes are legally responsible for meeti ng the residents' psychosocial needs. Objectives Understand the importance of ps ychosocial and spiritual care. Know how to provide psychosocial a nd spiritual care interventions for a resident during the later stages of life. Understand the regulatory requirements fo r meeting the needs of residents as whole persons. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 1 of 2 Section 5.0 Spiritual and Psychosocial Care Subsection 5.2 Spiritual Care-R eligion and Spirituality Issued 09/01/2003 Spiritual Care \u2014 Religion and Spirituality The approach of death often inspires a sear ch for peace and inner healing. Such peace or inner healing can replace fear and despair with hope and serenity. Hope for a physical healing may persist in those with incurable il lnesses, but hope for other kinds of healing can also be strongly desired in the face of death. One can hope for comfort, personal growth, love, reconciliation, courage, self-forgiveness, renewed happiness for one's family, or that one's beliefs will be fulfilled. A basic tenet of dealing with persons is to view the individual as a whole being \u2014 as a physical, psychological, social, and spiritual being. It is almost impossible to work effectively with only part of a person or w ith only one of these dimensions. Recognizing and treating the whole person is the basis fo r treating the person w ith dignity. Spiritual and psychosocial caregiving requires, like ot her kinds of caregiving, a team approach. When a facility cares for the phys ical needs of a resident's pr essure sore, for example, a direct caregiver is needed to turn and repos ition the resident at intervals, a treatment nurse is needed to change the dressing and track the progress of the sore, and a skilled health professional is needed for debreiding th e sore. Likewise a spiritual or psychosocial wound requires a team approach. All team memb ers can listen to the resident and family but a professional caregiver \u2014 a chaplain, priest , psychologist, or social worker is needed for more intensive spiritual a nd psychosocial interventions. The resident's need for hope continues thr oughout end of life and imminent death. The best support for the resident and family depe nds on knowing what the resident or family is hoping to achieve at the curr ent time. The resident may be hoping to avoid severe pain. Assuring the resident that his or her pain will be aggressive ly treated can provide a great deal of support. Residents may hope that they will see certain people before their death. Letting a resident know that these persons are on their way to the fac ility often gives the resident the support needed to live a little longer. Similarly, a family member may hope that the resident will not di e alone. Frequent communication and assuring them that they will be called when the resident's condition changes can help them remain hopeful. Many times a resident manages to live to reach a ce rtain goal \u2014 an anniversary, a family visit, the birth of a child. Listening to what the resident or fam ily hopes for and validating the resident's feelings often provides the groundwork for meaningful support. Spiritual Care Residents are diverse in their spiritual needs. Facilities and caregiver s are diverse in their ability to meet these needs. Some faciliti es are faith-based and have a significant faith culture associated with their care delivery system. These facilities may also have resources readily available, such as a chaplain or religious le ader, and regularly scheduled END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 2 of 2 Section 5.0 Spiritual and Psychosocial Care Subsection 5.2 Spiritual Care-R eligion and Spirituality Issued 09/01/2003 religious services. However, many resident s may not share the facility's religious affiliation or may not belong to any formal fa ith affiliation. Facilities that do not have a religious affiliation may have more limite d access to spiritual and psychosocial care resources. Caregivers are also diverse in their ability to meet the resident's spiritual and psychosocial needs. Some may not be comforta ble in meeting these needs or feel very inadequate in this role. Spiritual care of dying persons is a recogni zed aspect of living and dying. The World Health Organization's definition includes the need to provide spiritual care: \"Palliative care is the active total car e of patients whose disease is not responsive to curative treatment. Cont rol of pain, of other symptoms, and psychological, social and spiritual problems is paramount.\" Over the centuries, re ligious institutions ha ve cared for the dying. Dr. Cicely Saunder, founder of the hospice movement, focused on th e importance of spiritual care. Spiritual care is recognized as an essential part of a quality palliative care program and a requirement of the Joint Commission on Accred itation of Health Care Organizations, and hospice agencies. It may also be a consideration in fulfilling the long-term care regulatory requirements to meet the psychological a nd social needs of the resident. Spiritual care should be resi dent centered and based on the resident's own beliefs. Staff should never seek to impose their own religi ous or spiritual belie fs on the resident. Religion and Spirituality Religion and spirituality are different. Webster's Dictionary defines religion as a \"belief in a divine or superhuman power or powers to be obeyed and worshiped as the creator(s) and ruler(s) of the universe, any specific system of belief, worship, conduct etc., often involving a code of ethics a nd philosophy.\" Thus, the concept of religion may deal more with the dogma, practices, and rituals of worship of a specific organized group. Spirituality is more abstract. Webster defines the spiritual as being \"of the spirit or soul as distinguished from the body or material matters .\" Spirituality explores the person's inner meaning of life now and after death. It help s the person \"relate to the world within, the world around and the world beyond.\" END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 1 of 1 Section 5.0 Spiritual and Psychosocial Care Subsection 5.3 Psychosocial Care Issued 09/01/2003 Psychosocial Care The psychosocial dimension of end-of-lif e care, which encompasses both cognitive function and emotional health, calls for ope nness and sensitivity to the feelings and emotional needs of the resident and his or her family. Caregiving typically combines clinical and nonclinical interv entions. The following symptoms can be associated with emotional and spiritual suffering: Anxiety Depression Helplessness Aloneness Financial distress Meaninglessness Need for forgiveness Fear of the unknown Loss of important roles Conflicted relationships Hopelessness Inability to enjoy/celebrate Need to forgive END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 1 of 1 Section 5.0 Spiritual and Psychosocial Care Subsection 5.4 Assessing Psychosoc ial and Spiritual Suffering Issued 09/01/2003 Assessing Psychosocial and Spiritual Suffering Psychosocial and spiritual suffering is real, bu t can be difficult to recognize and treat. Many times residents experience spiritual or ps ychosocial pain but tran slate the pain into physical complaints. Physical pain is easier to talk about than psychosocial or spiritual pain. A variety of assessment tools are available for assessing belief systems and unresolved issues in a nonthr eatening way. One of the best assessment tools is listening to the resident or family member. Listen to what the person is saying. Does the person talk about hope or fear, joy or sadness, \" good old stories,\" or regr et missed opportunities during their lifetime? The Interdisciplinary Team is essential in this area of the resident's care. The facility staff listens to the re sident's needs and reports these signs and symptoms to the appropriate healthcare professional for further intervention . A long-term care facility ma y or may not have access to a professional spiritual caregiver. Faith-based facilities frequently have better access to a chaplain, minister, priest or rabbi of the facility's faith, but they may have limited access to spiritual professional caregivers of different faiths. Fa cilities should develop access to community professional spiritual caregivers of all faith s. Facilities should encourage and arrange visitations by the resident's local spiritual leaders on an on-going basis. Local ministerial alliance organizations can provi de facilities with ministers for a variety of religious affiliations. A facility may be able to provide psychos ocial support through its qualified social worker. If there are barriers to psychosocial services within the facility, and the resident cannot leave the facility, facility staff ma y consider accessing the services of a hospice agency.

The following interventions can be helpful. Put aside your schedule and tasks. O ffer your presence as a comfort and an opportunity for communi cation. Encourage the family or si gnificant others to sit with the resident, even if nothing is said. Arrange for the clergy, rabbi, or other spiritu al leader to visit the resident if the resident or family members so desire. Listen to stories or life reviews. Doing so is an excellent way to acknowledge the person's value to self and others. Allow expressions of anger, guilt, hurt, and fear wit hout minimizing or explaining them away. Encourage the resident to ac knowledge these feelings, and then let them go. Avoid clich\u00e9s such as \"It is God's \"God wants him in heaven,\" and so forth. Such messages may not match the resident 's beliefs. Never say, \"Everything is going to be all ri ght\" or \"You shouldn't feel that way.\" Read scriptures or other materials if the resident or family wishes to hear them. Encourage appropriate joy a nd humor. Laughter brings a lif t to the spir it, celebrates life, and keeps things in perspective. Share prayers, meditation, or music if the resident and family desire them. Use massage and relaxation to help the re sident relax and d eal with disturbing psychosocial or spiritual matters. These tec hniques also help re lieve pain and other distressing symptoms. Encourage completion of funeral arrangements. Encourage the resident to accept gratitude from others. Identify what constitutes a \"good death\" to the resident. Identify specific rituals or ceremonies important to the resident and family. Identify cultural issues that affect the resident and family. Encourage the family to give the resident permission to let go, when appropriate. Explain that it is all ri ght to cry; tears are normal, and show caring. Encourage expressions of affection. Be present with the resident a nd family if they want support. Listen to the last wishes and regrets of the resident.

It reviews the res ponsibilities of the facility and the hospice, and the sharing of responsibilities that f acilitate the provision of palliative care. Objectives Define hospice and identify the scope of care. State the general criteria in de termination of hos pice eligibility. Differentiate between the responsibilitie s of the LTC facility and those of the hospice team when collaborating in caring for the terminally ill. Know how to formulate a coordinated plan of care to be used by the skilled nursing facility and hospice. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 1 of 1 Section 6.0 Hospice Care in the Nursing Home Subsection 6.2 Definition of Hospice Care Issued 09/01/2003 Definition of Hospice Care Missouri and federal statutes entitle residents in LTC facilities to receive hospice services in the final stages of their life. Regulations establish that the nursing facility is the patient's home and the hospice interdisciplinar y team offers the patient, the caregiver system, and the family a program of care defined in the Medicare/Medicaid hospice benefit. By federal and state definition , \"Hospice care is intended to meet the physical, emotional and spiritual needs of patients and their families facing life ending illnesses. The goal of hospice care is to provide co mfort to the patient by assis ting with pain and symptom management and to enhance the quality of life for both the patient and family.\" Residents electing hospice are not \"giving up\"; nor are they receiving less care. In fact, nursing home patients receive th e benefit of LTC staff and the added benefit provided by a team of medical professionals focused on palliation and comfort. The challenge in providing this care is that each provider must cooperate with, communicate with, establish, and agree upon coordi nated services that will not only reflect the hospice philosophy, but also be responsive to the unique needs of the resident and his or her desires. To be successful in meeting these needs, both the LTC provider and the hospice provider must be knowledgeable and attentive to the Medicare conditions of participation and state licensure regulations of each entity.

By electing hospice, the resident has clearly asked that his or her care be focused on pall iation. There are significant benefits to this choice, especially the added attention of nurses to help manage the pain and symptoms relating to the life-ending illn ess, and the one-to-one emotional support for the resident and the family. However, because the hospice is financially responsible (in Medicare/Medicaid cases) for all medications, medical supplies, and equipment related to the terminal diagnosis, patient and families may have received an additional benefit of fiscal relief. Moreover, hospice volunteers vis it residents on an as needed basis and often provide valuable interaction w ith the resident or family. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 1 of 1 Section 6.0 Hospice Care in the Nursing Home Subsection 6.4 Determination of Hospice Eligibility Issued 09/01/2003 Determination of Hospice Eligibility General Criteria Patients must meet the following criteria before they are eligible to elect the hospice benefit. The patient must be diagnosed with a terminal or life ending illness; have a life expectancy of six months or less, as determined by the attending physician and the hospice interdisciplinary team; seeking palliative (pain and symptom reli ef) rather than curative treatment. In addition, the patient, family, and physic ian must understand th at artificial, life- prolonging procedures are not consistent with hospice care; and that admission to hospice services is approved by the attending phys ician and the hospice medical director. The most difficult part of determining a pati ent's eligibility for hospice benefits is the physician's certification that the patient has a prognosis of six months or less. To help physicians and hospices identify patients w ho may be hospice appropriate, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued a Local Medical Review Policy (LMRP) that defines prognostic criteria (by disease). This LMRP should be examined to determine whether the patient is eligib le. The guidelines examine documentable evidences that \"if the disease follows its nor mal course\" the prognosis is for six months or less. The current guidelines include lung di sease, heart disease, kidney failure, HIV, stroke and coma, dementia, liver failure, ALS, lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and decline in health status. Two of the 12 current LMRP guidelines are provided in the appendix: the LMRPs for Dementia and fo r Decline in Health Status. The other guidelines can be viewed on the Internet at: http://www.iamedicare.com/Pr ovider/policy/policyhome.htm In a healthcare environment marked by constant change, the task before us is to bring together two providers, a LTC facility and a hos pice, each with its distinct culture, and use their respective strengths to provide compa ssionate skilled care of the highest quality to individuals who are in the final weeks and months of life.

The actual written plan of care may vary from facility to facility; how ever, the content incorporates the identification of problems, goals, and inte rventions, and designates the role of each team member. While long-term care plans generally focus on functional status, rehabilitation/restorative nursing, health main tenance and daily care needs, hospice plans to a greater extent address pain and symptom management , preparation for death and bereavement, and end-of-life tasks. The challenge for both the hospice and the LTC facility is collaboration to enhance the quality of services for the patient. The care plan is a communications tool between caregivers and promotes continuity by establishing resident/patient goals and objectives. Care planning sets the stage for implementing and evaluating care provid ed to the patient. The hospice service retains overall professional management of the plan of care related to the terminal illness. LTC Staff Hospice Staff Collaborative Provides relevant physician orders, comprehensive assessment (MDS), and care planning through the RAI process, medication list, Durable Medical Equipment (DME) list, and social service notes needed to initiate palliative plan of care.

For residents receiving Hospice benefit care, the surveyor should evaluate the following to determine compliance: The plan of care reflects th e participation of the hospice, the facility, and the resident to the extent possible; The plan of care includes directiv es for managing pain and other uncomfortable symptoms and is revise d and updated as needed to reflect the individual's current status; Drugs and medical supplies are provided as needed for the needed palliation and management of the te rminal illness and related conditions; The hospice and the facility communicate with each other when any changes are indicated to the plan of care; END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 2 of 4 Section 6.0 Hospice Care in the Nursing Home Subsection 6.18 Long Term Care Regulatory Requirements and Expectations of Hospice Services Issued 09/01/2003 The hospice and the facility are awar e of the other's responsibilities in implementing the plan of care; The facility's services are consistent with the plan of care developed in coordination with the hospice, (the hospice patient/resident in a SNF/NF should not experience any lack of SN F/NF services or personal care because of his/her Status as a hospice patient); and The SNF/NF offers the same services to its residents who have elected the hospice benefit as it furnishes to it s residents who have not elected the hospice benefit. The patient/resident ha s the right to refuse any services. NOTE: If you have concerns about the resident in rela tion to care provided by the hospice agency, refer the issue to the State Agency (SA) responsible for surveying hospices. CMS's Identification of Problem Areas In June 2000, the Department of Health a nd Human Services CMS Region VII issued the Survey and Certification Regional Letter Numb er 00-07. This letter was in response to questions submitted to CMS by the Hospice Association of America. It identifies four major areas of concern with the implementati on of hospice in LTC facilities: The provision of care and services do es not reflect the hospice philosophy. Problems with the coordination, delivery a nd review of the plan of care between the hospice and the LTC facility. Ineffective systems in place to monitor/assure that the plan of care meets the resident's needs in the area of pain management and symptom control. Poor communication between the ho spice and nursing home staff: o Nursing home staff are often not aware of the ho spice philosophy; o The plan of care does not reflect the hospice philosophy or adequately address pain management and symptom control; and o Hospice and LTC staff do not communicate problems encountered with the pain management assessments and make needed revisions to the plan of care in an effective and timely manner. SLTC's Interpretation of Major Concern Areas The care and services do not reflect the hospice philosophy when the corporate, administrative or clinical lead ership does not adopt the hospi ce philosophy. Each facility should evaluate its program to see if the program is committed to the hospice philosophy. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Determine if the following are in place: Policies and procedures for providing end-of-life care. Palliative care protocols for pain management. Palliative care protocols for tr eatment of distressing symptoms. Care directives to mainta in the residents' dignity. Care directives to assist the family/significant other in the loss. Identified problems with the coordination, de livery and review of the plan of care between the hospice and the LTC facility . Problems arise when there isn't adequate coordination of care between the two providers . Surveyors report finding two separate care plans for residents receiving hospice benefits \u2014 the LTC care plan and the hospice care plan. Frequently, the hospice ca re plan is located in a diffe rent section of the chart or even a different section of the nurse's stati on. This fragmentation of the care planning can hamper the staff's ability to e ffectively care for the resident. Facilities must review their policy to assure integration of th e hospice and LTC plan of care. The hospice nurse's expertise in the management of pain and other distressing symptoms can contribute signifi cantly to end-of-life goal setting and care plan development. The hospice nurse is an essential team member. The direct caregiver is another valuable team member in the assessment and care plan deve lopment process who fr equently spends the most time with the resident. Good care requ ires ongoing communicati on skills to keep all staff persons informed of changing care needs. Occasionally, the elder abuse hot line receives an allegation of neglect or starvation of a resident who is in the end stages of life. The state survey agency must respond to this allegation but the investigation can add a burde n to the staff and family who are dealing with the end stages of a dying resident. Good communication and clear concise care planning regarding palliative care will reduc e the likelihood of misinformed staff making allegations to the hotline. Documentation shoul d support the goals of the interdisciplinary team and is a key component in deal ing with this type of situation. Ineffective systems to monitor and/or assure the plan of care is meeting the resident's needs in the area of pain management and symptom control . This issue, again, shows the need for the facility's leadership structure to adopt the hospice philosophy in assuring that pain management and symptom contro l is adequately addressed. Without this leadership, the coordination fo r quality end-of-life care will be haphazard and fragmented at best. Pain and symptom mana gement in-service training are an integral part of caring for hospice residents. Due to LTC facilities high incidence of staff turnover, in-service training should be provided on an ongoing ba sis. A one-time in-service training by the hospice will not assure adequate pain mana gement by the caregiver responsible for Page 3 of 4 Section 6.0 Hospice Care in the Nursing Home Subsection 6.18 Long Term Care Re gulatory Requirements and Expectations of Hospice Services Issued 09/01/2003 END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 4 of 4 Section 6.0 Hospice Care in the Nursing Home Subsection 6.18 Long Term Care Regulatory Requirements and Expectations of Hospice Services Issued 09/01/2003 assessing and treating the resident's pain. The IDT s hould identify inadequate pain control or symptom relief, and will need to work together to determine the cause of the problem. Is inadequate pain control related to: staff's lack of knowledge in pain assessment, staff's attitude regarding narcotic administration, availability of the medication, inadequate physician orders fo r the treatment of the pain, resident's right to refuse treatment, or other causes, such as psychosocial, emotional or sp iritual concerns? If the facility staff identifies inadequate pain control or the pa in escalates between hospice visits, the LTC staff should understand the process for changing pain medication orders. Sometimes, just knowing that the re sident is on hospice and that the hospice provider should be consulte d for pain management is an important communication obstacle that needs to be overcome. Poor communication between the hospice and nursing home staff is probably the underlying cause of most of the problems discu ssed in regard to hospice in LTC facilities. Communication, leadership and accountabi lity are the key factors in program development and implementation. When any of these factors are missing in either of the two providers, the results can be poor resident outcomes. In summary, the LTC provider should have a clear philosophy and program designed to address the needs of the hospice residents. Th e hospice provider, resident/legal surrogate and the facility must work together to deve lop and implement an individualized plan of care for the resident. The means for accomplis hing this objective is to communicate, communicate, and communicate. END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 1 of 5 Section 6.0 Hospice Care in the Nursing Home Subsection 6.19 Case Study Issued 09/01/2003 Hospice Care in the Nursing Home Case Study Mrs. Smith, Scenario II Mrs. Smith has a diagnosis of metastatic cancer. She is currently receiving radiation therapy for treatment of a brain tumor. Her current func tional status is ambulatory with a walker to the dining room for meals and to activities of her choice. She tires easily and becomes short of breath with ADLs requiring the direct care staff to provide limited assistance. She has fallen several times in the past. Her walking, standing, and sitting balance is good unless she rises too quickl y. She denies pain during routine assessments. She has had several conversations about the prognosis and trea tment options with her physician. Mrs. Smith's daughter lives across the country and is unable to visit frequen tly because of her own health problems. Mrs. Smith talked with her daughter about her prognosis and treatment options and the daughter supports her decisions. Mrs. Smith knows that her diagnosis is terminal but would like to have some time to return to her apartment to live independentl y. Mrs. Smith's physician is admitting her to the skilled nursing facility for care. Upon admission to the skilled f acility, the Social Service Designee (SSD) asked Mrs. Smith about advance directives for healthcare. Mrs. Smith provided her with a copy of her healthcare directives. The RAI coordinator prepared for the initial care plan meeting. She talked with Mrs. Smith to determine her personal goals for treatment in the nursing home. The RAI coordinator asked Mrs. Sm ith: \"what are you hoping will happen?\" Her response was that she wanted to get through the radiation therapy strong enough to return to her apartment. The RAI coordinator talked with Mrs. Smith's physician to underst and the goals for the nursing home stay.

END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 2 of 5 Section 6.0 Hospice Care in the Nursing Home Subsection 6.19 Case Study Issued 09/01/2003 Mrs. Smith, Scenario II , continued Mrs. Smith, the RAI Coordinator, the SSD, the physical therapist, the charge nurse on the unit where Mrs. Smith lives, and the nurse aide who cares for Mrs. Smith on the day shift, met to discuss the care she wants to receive and her goals for treatment. Since Mrs. Smith's goal was to be able to go back to her apartment and live independently after the radiation therapy, th e RAI Coordinator developed a care plan using three types of goals in her care plan. The first goal is to maintain her present abilities while increasing her conditioning; the second is to provide rehabilitation services to restore Mrs. Smith to an independent life style; a nd the third goal is the prevention of any further falls. During the radiation therapy she was weak and fatigued most of the time. Therapists were scheduled to work with her three times a week for st rength building activities. The nurse aides will assist her w ith her ADLs as needed but with the understanding that th ey will not do the activities for her unless she asks, even though she is slow, since rehabilitation is a goal. Fina lly, to accomplish the goal of preventing additional falls, the nurse aide will monitor her for balance and safety during all ADLs. The RAI coordinator has also asked fo r a hospice consult so that Mrs. Smith will understand the hospice benefit and feel comfortable electing it when her goals change from rehabilitation to palliative car e. A hospice nurse explained the hospice benefit and answered Mrs. Smith's questions about payment. She also explained how hospice works with her doctor and Long Term Care Facility (LTC) team, and how hospice addresses comfort issues. After radiation therapy Mrs. Smith was discharged back to her apartment. She was still able to ambulate and transfer independently with her walk er. The hospice nurse came to her apartment and admitted her to hospice care. Mrs. Smith was still not having pain except for occasional evening headaches, relieved by one percocet. Mrs. Smith agreed to have the hospice SW visit her; she did not have a 24-hour caregiver and she knew that she would need to be placed back at the facility when she was no longer Specific Goals: \u0099 Maintain nutrition and ADL functioning \u0099 Rehabilitation to strengthen her condition \u0099 Prevention of falls Hospice Consultation Discharged to home Hospice Admission PRN Pain management for intermittent pain RN, SW, HHA visits initiated END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 3 of 5 Section 6.0 Hospice Care in the Nursing Home Subsection 6.19 Case Study Issued 09/01/2003 Mrs. Smith, Scenario II , continued independently mobile. She agreed to have the aide visit and help with ADLs. She refused the chaplain, because she had frequent visits from her mini ster; and the volunteer, because she was sure there were othe rs who would benefit more from the volunteer's services. Mrs. Smith declined rapidly over the next several weeks. The hospice RN and SW were in frequent communication with Mrs. Smith's daughter. Mrs. Smith began to fall more frequently and was having diffi culty getting out of bed. She developed a wound on her coccyx from sitting in her chair all day and she was also incontinent. She agreed to move to the LTC facility. The hospice SW coordinated the admission with the ECF SW, and also called the daughter to inform her and to assure her that the hospice team would be following her there. The hospice RN provided the LTC facility with an up-to-date me dication list, hospice Plan of Treatment, and nursing care plans. Hospice notified the physician of admission to the LTC facility. Upon admission, Mrs. Smith had increasing periods of confusion. She was restless at night in bed, and restless during the day in the chair. Ov er the next two weeks she had intermittent confusion and periods of extreme agitation. The nursing staff observed that he r periods of agitation were relieved with prn pain medica tion, but also that they were occurring more frequently. The hospice nurse and LTC nurse reviewed Mrs. Smith's use of the prn pain medication together and its effects. The hospice nurse called the physician and a pain medication was ordered on a regular basis with pain meds for breakthrough pain as evidenced by increased agitation. A mild sedative was also ordered for increased agitation, and a st ool softener to prevent constipation. Mrs. Smith stil l had periods of agitation. The LTC nurse and hospice nurse noti ced that she relaxed more when they told her they had spoken with her daughter. The hospice nurse felt it might be beneficial for Mrs. Smith to have more support from the Hospice team. She contacted the daughter and received permission to have the hospice Frequent communication with family regarding treatment decisions Readmitted to LTC facility with Hospice involvement Goal: Palliative Care Pain and symptom management Nutrition and hydration as able Emotional and spiritual support SNF and Hospice Collaborate on Plan of Care Nonverbal communication of pain exhibited by restlessness and agitation - treated by pain meds Comfort meds added to Care Plan END OF LIFE CARE FOR RESIDENTS IN NURSING FACILITIES Page 4 of 5 Section 6.0 Hospice Care in the Nursing Home Subsection 6.19 Case Study Issued 09/01/2003 Mrs. Smith, Scenario II, continued Chaplain and a volunteer visit. The daughter agreed. During the chaplain's phone assessment with the daughter, she discovered that Mrs. Smith ha d also had an adult son who had died a few years ago. Mrs. Smith, her daughter explained, was never the same after his death, but she had found much comfort in readi ng the Psalms. Her daughter was also very surprised to discover that nobody had known about this son. She thought her mother would have shared that information. The hospice ch aplain visited, read Psalms, and requested that the volunt eer also read from this scripture. The chaplain also called Mrs. Smith's minister who began visiting more frequently. Within a few weeks Mrs. Smith slept more and began refusing to eat. The hospice nurse and social worker provided support and education to the staff that wanted to see Mrs. Smith eat more. The IDT team met to discuss the decreased need and desire fo r food as a part of the dying process. All staff were instruct ed to offer foods and fluids, but not to force, or give anythi ng orally, to Mrs. Smith if she was not alert. The care plan was updated frequently because of Mrs. Smith's rapidly declining condition. The hospice social worker pr ovided emotional support and guided the direct care staff in their efforts to meet Mrs. Smith's emotional needs. She discussed funeral arrangements with the daughter. Mrs. Smith's level of consci ousness continued to change until she was unable to communicate verbally. Her breathing patterns changed and oxygen was ordered per nasal canula. Fluids were wit hheld and attention to mouth care was provided. The hospice social worker and nurse talked with Mrs. Smith's da ughter about her deteriorating condition, supporting her by phone because of her inability to travel to be with her moth er.

Advance care planning: The process of identifying the reside nt's personal prefer ences and values, which, in conjunction with his or her current and anticipated medical status and goals, provide the basis for making decisions about end-or-life care. Advance directive: This term may refer to any directi on made before an individual looses decisional capacity regarding his or her healthcare treatment wishes. Written advance directives may include living wills, healthcare treatment directives , and durable powers of attorney for healthcare. Assessment: Determination of a resident's care needs, based on a formal, structured evaluation of the resident's physical and psychol ogical condition and ability to perform activities of daily living. Care planning: The process used for each resident that includes measurable objectives, and timetables to meet a resident's medical, nursing, mental, and psychosocial needs identified in the comprehensive assessment. The care plan must describe the services that are to be furnished to attain or maintain the resident's highest practicable physical, mental and psychosocial well-being and any services that would otherwise be required but no t provided because of the resident's exercise of rights to refuse treatment. Chronic Disease: A disease that is permanent, or leav es residual disability, or is caused by nonreversible pathological alteration.

Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care (DPAHC, sometimes DPOA): A legal document in which a competent person gives another person ( called an attorney-in-fact) the power to make healthcare decisions, if he or she is unable to make those decisions. A DPAHC may include guidelines for the attorney-in-fact to follow in making decisions on behalf of the incompetent person. Hospice Care: Services for the terminally ill that may be provided in the home, hospital, or long- term care facility. Hospice care includes home he alth services, volunteer support, grief counseling, and pain management. Hydration: The level of fluid in the body. The loss of fluid, or dehydration, occurs when the body loses more water or fluid than it takes in. A body cannot maintain adequate blood pressure, get enough oxygen and nutrients to the cells, or rid it self of wastes if it has too little fluid. Interdisciplinary team: A number of people working together , sharing information. Patient care IDTs are comprised of the resident, physician, soci al worker, nursing assistants, activities director, dietitians, and nurses. In hospice ca re, the team members are the nurse , aide, social worker, chaplain, and medical director.

Court Avenue Des Moines, IA 50309-2017 Hospice - Determining Terminal Status Page 2 of 9 Original Policy Ending Date N/A Revision Effective Date N/A Revision Ending Date N/A LMRP Description Medicare coverage of hospice depends on a physician's certification that an individual's prognosis is a life expectancy of six months or less if the terminal illness runs its normal course. This policy describes guidelines to be used by Regional Home Health Intermediaries in reviewing hospice claims and by hospice prov iders to determine eligibility of beneficiaries for hospice benefits. Although guidelines applicable to certain disease categories are included, this policy is applicable to all hospice patients. It is intended to be used to identify any Medicare beneficiary whose current clinical status and anticipated progression of disease is more likely than not to result in a li fe expectancy of six months or less. Clinical variables with general applicability without regar d to diagnosis, as well as clinical variables applicable to a limited number of specific diagnoses, are provided. Patients who meet the guidelines established herein are expected to have a life expectancy of six months or less if the terminal illness runs its normal course. Some patients may not meet these guidelines, yet still have a life expectancy of 6 months or less. Coverage for these patients may be approved if documentation of clinical factors supporting a less than 6-month life expectancy not included in these guidelines is provided. If a patient improves or stabilizes sufficiently over time while in hospice such that he/she no longer has a prognosis of six months or less from the most recent recertification evaluation or definitive interim evaluation, that patient should be considered for discharge from the Medicare hospice benefit. Such patients can be re-enrolled for a new benefit period when a decline in their clinical status is such that their life expectancy is again six months or less. On the other hand, patients in the terminal stage of their illness who originally qualify for the Medicare hospice benefit but stabilize or improve while receiving hospice care, yet have a reasonable expectation of continued decline for a life expectancy of less than six months, remain eligible for hospice care. Indications and Limitations of Coverage and/or Medical Necessity A patient will be considered to have a life expectancy of six months or less if he/she meets the non-disease specific decline in clinical status guidelines described in Part I. Alternatively, the baseline non-disease specific guidelines de scribed in Part II plus the applicable disease specific guidelines listed in the appendix will establish the necessary expectancy.

Court Avenue Des Moines, IA 50309-2017 Hospice - Determining Terminal Status Page 3 of 9 Part I. Decline in clinical status guidelines Patients will be considered to have a life expectancy of six months or less if there is documented evidence of decline in clinical status based on the guidelines listed below. Since determination of decline presumes assessment of the patient's status over time, it is essential that both baseline and follow-up determinations be reported where appropriate. Baseline data may be established on admission to hospice or by using existing information from records. Other clin ical variables not on this list may support a six-month or less life expectancy. These should be documented in the clinical record. These changes in clinical variables apply to patients whose decline is not considered to be reversible. They are listed in order of their likelihood to predict poor survival, the most predictive first and the least predictive last. No specific number of variables must be met, but fewer of those listed first (more predictive) and more of those listed last (least predictive) would be expected to predict longevity of six months or less. 1. Progression of disease as documented by worsening clinical status, symptoms, signs and laboratory results A. Clinical Status 1) Recurrent or intractable infections such as pneumonia, sepsis or upper urinary tract. 2) Progressive inanition as documented by: a) Weight loss not due to reversible causes such as depression or use of diuretics b) Decreasing anthropomorphic measurements (mid-arm circumference, abdominal girth), not due to reversible causes such as depression or use of diuretics c) Decreasing serum albumen or cholesterol 3) Dysphagia leading to recurrent aspiration and/or inadequate oral intake documented by decreasing f ood portion consumption. B. Symptoms 1) Dyspnea with increasing respiratory rate 2) Cough, intractable 3) Nausea/vomiting poorly responsive to treatment 4) Diarrhea, intractable 5) Pain requiring increasing doses of major analgesics more than briefly. C. Signs 1) Decline in systolic blood pressure to below 90 or progressive postural hypotension 2) Ascites 3) Venous, arterial or lymphatic obstruction to local progression or metastatic disease 4) Edema Cahaba Government Benefit Administrators Original Policy Effective: 07/31/2003 A CMS Contracted Regional Home Health Intermediary 400 E. Court Avenue Des Moines, IA 50309-2017 Hospice - Determining Terminal Status Page 4 of 9 5) Pleural / pericardial effusion 6) Weakness 7) Change in level of consciousness D. Laboratory (When available. Lab testing is not required to establish hospice eligibility.) 1) Increasing pCO2 or decreasing pO2 or decreasing SaO2 2) Increasing calcium, creatinine or liver function studies 3) Increasing tumor markers (e.g. CEA, PSA) 4) Progressively decreasing or increasing serum sodium or increasing serum potassium 2. Decline in Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) or Palliative Performance Score (PPS) from <70% due to progression of disease. 3. Increasing emergency room visits, hospitalizations, or physician's visits related to hospice primary diagnosis 4. Progressive decline in Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) for dementia (from 7A on the FAST) 5. Progression to dependence on assistance with additional activities of daily living See Part II, Section 2. 6. Progressive stage 3-4 pressure ulcers in spite of optimal care Part II. Non-disease specific baseline guidelines (both of these should be met) 1. Physiologic impairment of functional status as demonstrated by: Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) or Palliative Performance Score (PPS) 70. Note that two of the disease specific guidelines (HIV Disease, Stroke and Coma) establish a lower qualifying KPS or PPS. 2. Dependence on assistance for two or more activities of daily living (ADLs) a. Feeding b. Ambulation c. Continence d. Transfer e. Bathing f. Dressing See appendix for disease specific guidelines to be used with these (Part II) baseline guidelines. The baseline guidelines do not independently qualify a patient for hospice coverage.

It does not mean, however, that meeting the guideline is obligatory. Part III. Co-morbidities - although not the primary hospice diagnosis, the presence of disease such as the following, the severity of which is likely to contribute to a life expectancy of six months or less, should be considered in determining hospice eligibility.

Court Avenue Des Moines, IA 50309-2017 Hospice - Determining Terminal Status Page 6 of 9 Reasons for Denial Medical review of records of hospice patient s that do not document that patients meet the guidelines set forth herein may result in denial of coverage unless other clinical circumstances reasonably predictive of a life expec tancy of six months or less are provided. The condition of some patients receiving hospice care may stabilize or improve during or due to that care, with the expectation that the stabilization or improvement will not be brief and temporary. In such circumstances, if the patient's condition changes such that he or she no longer has a prognosis of life expectancy of six months or less, and that improvement can be expected to continue outside the hospice setting, then that patient should be discharged from hospice. On the other hand, patients in the terminal stage of their illness who originally qualify for the Medicare hospice benefit but stabilize or improve while receiving hospice care, yet have a reasonable expectation of continued decline for a life expectancy of less than six months, remain eligible for hospice care. Non-covered ICD-9 Code(s) N/A Non-covered Diagnosis N/A Coding Guidelines Claims are to include an ICD-9 code for the admitting diagnosis and the principal diagnosis if different from the admitting diagnosis. Codes that represent co-morbidities may be listed as secondary diagnoses. NOTE: The submission on a claim of codes reflecting co-morbidities does not make the Hospice agency financially liable for services and medications unless they are related to the terminal diagnosis. Such services otherwise eligible for Medicare coverage remain covered as non-hospice Part A and Part B benefits. Documentation Requirements General Guidelines : Documentation certifying terminal status must contain enough information to support terminal status upon review. Documentation of the applicable criteria listed under the \"Indications\" section of this policy would meet this requirement. If other clinical indicators of decline not listed in this policy such as psychol ogical and spiritual factors form the basis for certifying terminal status, they should be documented as well. Recertification for hospice care requires the same clinical standards be met as for initial certification, but they need not be reiterated. They may be incorporated by specific reference as part (or all) of the indication for recertification. Documentation should \"paint a picture\" for the reviewer to clearly see why the patient is appropriate for hospice care and the level of care provided, i.e., routine home, continuous home, Cahaba Government Benefit Administrators Original Policy Effective: 07/31/2003 A CMS Contracted Regional Home Health Intermediary 400 E.

The records should include observations and data, not merely conclusions. However, documentation expectations should comport with normal clinical documentation practices. Unless elements in the record require explanation, such as a non-morbid diagnosis or indicators of likely greater than 6-month survival, as stated below, no extra or additional record entries should be needed to show hospice benefit eligibility. The amount and detail of documentation will differ in different situations. Thus a patient with metastatic small cell CA may be demonstrated to be hospice eligible with less documentation than a chronic lung disease patient. These situations are obvious. Patients with chronic lung disease, long term survival in hospice, or apparent stability can still be eligible for hospice benefits, but sufficient justification for a less than six month prognosis should appear in the record. If the documentation includes any findings inconsistent with or tending to disprove a less than 6- month prognosis, they should be answered or refuted by other entries, or specifically addressed and explained. Most facts and observations tending to suggest a greater than 6 month prognosis are predictable and apparent, such as a prolonged stay in hospice or a low immediate mortality diagnosis, as stated above. But specific entries can also call for an answer, such as an opinion by one team member or recovery of ADLS when they were part of the basis for the initial declaration of eligibility. Also the lack of certain documentation elements such as a tissue diagnosis for cancer will not create non-eligibility for the hospice benefit, but does necessitate other supportive documentation. Documentation submitted may include information from periods of time that fall outside the billing period currently under review. Include supporting events such as a change in the level of activities of daily living, recent hospitalizations, and the known date of death (if you are billing for a period of time prior to the billing period in which death occurred.) Documentation should support the level of care being provided to the patient during the time period under review, i.e. routine or continuous home or inpatient, respite, or general. The reviewer should be able to easily identify the dates and times of changes in levels of care and the reason for the change. For Short-term General Inpatient Level of Care, supporting documentation might include : Pain requiring: Complicated technical delivery of medication requiring registered nurse to do calibration, tubing change, or site care Frequent evaluation by physician/nurse Aggressive treatment to control pain Frequent medication adjustment Transfusions for symptom relief Symptom changes: Sudden deterioration requiring intensive nursing intervention Uncontrolled nausea and vomiting Cahaba Government Benefit Administrators Original Policy Effective: 07/31/2003 A CMS Contracted Regional Home Health Intermediary 400 E.

Utilization Guidelines N/A Other Comments Recognizing that determination of life expectancy during the course of a terminal illness is difficult, this intermediary has established medical guidelines for determining appropriateness for Medicare hospice services. These guidelines form a reasonable approach to the determination of life expectancy based on available research, and may be revised as more research is available. Coverage of hospice care for patients not meeting the guidelines in this policy may be denied. However, some patients may not meet the guidelines, yet still be appropriate for hospice care, because of co-morbidities or decline. Coverage for these patients may be approved on an individual consideration basis. This policy will be updated as medical research validates or invalidates the guidelines listed herein as predictive of terminal status.

This policy consolidates, simplifies and supercedes the several current hospice local medical review policies on determining terminal status previously implemented by this contractor whose references are incorporated herewith. Advisory Committee Notes This policy does not reflect the sole opinion of the contractor or Contractor Medical Director. Although the final decision rests with the contractor, this policy was developed in cooperation with advisory groups, which includes representatives from relevant interested parties. Advisory Committee meeting date: Comments were received by regular and e-mail from the Intermediary Advisory Committee and reviewed prior to policy finalization. Start Date of Comment Period 02/24/2003 Ending Date of Comment Period 04/10/2003 Start Date of Notice Period 06/17/2003 Revision History N/A Hospice - Determining Terminal Status Disease Specific Guidelines Note: These guidelines are to be used in conjun ction with the \"Non-dis ease specific baseline guidelines\" described in Part II of the basic policy. Section I - Cancer Diagnoses A. Disease with distant metastases at presentation OR B. Progression from an earlier stage of dis ease to metastatic disease with either 1. A continued decline in spite of therapy 2. Patient declines further disease directed therapy Note: Certain cancers with poor prognoses (e.g. small cell lung cancer, brain cancer and pancreatic cancer) may be hospice eligible with out fulfilling the other criteria in this section. Section II - Non-Cancer Diagnoses A. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis General Considerations: 1. ALS tends to progress in a linear fashion over time. Thus the overall rate of decline in each patient is fairly constant and predictable, unlike many other non-cancer diseases. 2. However, no single variable deteriorates at a uniform rate in all patients. Therefore, multiple clinical parameters are required to judge the progression of ALS. 3. Although ALS usually presents in a localized anatomical area, the location of initial presentation does not correlate with survival time. By the time patients become end-stage, muscle denervation has become widespread, a ffecting all areas of the body, and initial predominance patterns do not persist. 4. Progression of disease differs markedly from patient to patient. Some patients decline rapidly and die quickly; others progress more slowly. Fo r this reason, the history of the rate of progression in individual patients is im portant to obtain to predict prognosis. 5. In end-state ALS, two factors are critical in determining prognosis: ability to breathe, and to a lesser extent ability to swallow. The former can be managed by artificial ventilation, and the latter by gastrostomy or other artificial feedi ng, unless the patient has recurrent aspiration pneumonia. While not necessarily a contraindicati on to Hospice Care, the decision to institute either artificial ventilation or artificial feed ing will significantly alter six-month prognosis. 6. Examination by a neurologist within three mont hs of assessment for hospice is advised, both to confirm the diagnosis and to assist with prognosis. 7. Criteria: Patients will be considered to be in the terminal stage of ALS (life expectancy of six months or less) if they meet the following criteria . (Should fulfill 1, 2, or 3). 1. Patient should demonstrate critic ally impaired breathing capacity. a. Critically impaired breathing capacity as demonstrated by all the following characteristics occurring within the 12 months preceding initial hosp ice certification: i. Vital capacity (VC) less than 30% of normal (if available); ii. Dyspnea at rest; iii. Requiring supplemental oxygen at rest; iv. Patient declines artificial ventilation; external ventilation used for comfort measures only. 2. Patient should demonstrate both rapid progression of ALS and critical nutritional impairment. a. Rapid progression of ALS as demonstrat ed by all the following characteristics occurring within the 12 months precedi ng initial hospice certification: i. Progression from independent ambulat ion to wheelchair to bed bound status; ii. Progression from normal to barely intelligible or unintelligible speech; iii. Progression from normal to pureed diet; iv. Progression from independence in most or all activities of daily living (ADLs) to needing major assistance by caretaker in all ADLs. b. Critical nutritional impairment as demonst rated by all the following characteristics occurring within the 12 months precedi ng initial hospice certification: i. Oral intake of nutrients and fluids insufficient to sustain life; ii. Continuing weight loss; iii. Dehydration or hypovolemia; iv. Absence of artificial feeding methods, sufficient to sustain life, but not for relieving hunger. 3. Patient should demonstrate both rapid progre ssion of ALS and life-threatening complications. a. Rapid progression of ALS, see 2.a above. b. Life-threatening complications as demonstrated by one of the following characteristics occurring within the 12 months preceding initial hosp ice certification: i. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia (with or without tube feedings); ii. Upper urinary tract infection, e.g., pyelonephritis; iii. Sepsis; iv. Recurrent fever after antibiotic therapy; v. Stage 3 or 4 decubitus ulcer(s) B. Dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Patients will be considered to be in the terminal st age of dementia (life expectancy of six months or less) if they meet the following criteria. Patients with dementia should show all the following characteristics: 1. Stage seven or beyond according to th e Functional Assessment Staging Scale; 2. Unable to ambulate without assistance; 3. Unable to dress without assistance; 4. Unable to bathe without assistance; 5. Urinary and fecal incontinence, intermittent or constant; 6. No consistently meaningful verbal communicati on: stereotypical phrases only or the ability to speak is limited to six or fewer intelligible words. Patients should have had one of the following within the past 12 months: 1. Aspiration pneumonia; 2. Pyelonephritis or other upper urinary tract infection;3 3. Septicemia; 4. Decubitus ulcers, multiple, stage 3-4; 5. Fever, recurrent after antibiotics; 6. Inability to maintain sufficient fluid and calorie intake with 10% weight loss during the previous six months or serum albumin <2.5 gm/dl. Note: This section is specific for Alzheimer's Disease and related disorders, and is not appropriate for other types of dement ia, such as multi infarct dementia. C. Heart Disease Patients will be considered to be in the terminal st age of heart disease (life expectancy of six months or less) if they meet the following criteria. (1 and 2 should be present. Factors from 3 will add supporting documentation.) 1. At the time of initial certification or recert ification for hospice, the patient is or has been already optimally treated for heart disease or ar e patients who are either not candidates for surgical procedures or who decline those procedu res. (Optimally treated means that patients who are not on vasodilators have a medical reason for refusing these drugs, e.g., hypotension or renal disease.) 2. The patient is classified as New York He art Association (NYHA) Class IV and may have significant symptoms of heart failure or angina at rest. (Class IV patients with heart disease have an inability to carry on any physical acti vity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure or of the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increa sed.) Significant congestive heart failure may be documented by an ejection fraction of 20%, but is not required if not already available. 3. Documentation of the following factors will support but is not required to establish eligibility for hospice care: a. Treatment resistant symptomatic suprav entricular or ventricular arrhythmias; b. History of cardiac arrest or resuscitation; c. History of unexplained syncope; d. Brain embolism of cardiac origin; e. Concomitant HIV disease. D. HIV Disease Patients will be considered to be in the terminal stage of their illness (life expectancy of six months or less) if they meet the following criteria: HIV Disease (1 and 2 should be present; factor s from 3 will add supporting documentation) 1.

Hepatitis C refractory to interferon treatment. Patients awaiting liver transplant who otherwise fit the above criteria may be certified for the Medicare hospice benefit, but if a donor organ is procured, the patient should be discharged from hospice. F. Pulmonary Disease Patients will be considered to be in the terminal stage of pulmonary disease (life expectancy of six months or less) if they meet the following criteria. The criteria refer to patients with various forms of advanced pulmonary disease who eventually follow a final common pathway for end stage pulmonary disease. (1 and 2 should be present. Document ation of 3, 4, and 5, will lend supporting documentation.): 1. Severe chronic lung disease as documented by both a and b: a. Disabling dyspnea at rest, poorly or unres ponsive to bronchodilators, resulting in decreased functional capacity, e.g., bed to chair existence, fatigue, and cough: (Documentation of Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1), after bronchodilator, less than 30% of predicted is objective evidence for disabling dyspnea, but is not necessary to obtain.) b.

Court Avenue, Des Moines, IA 50309-2017 Page 1 of 17 Appendices Midwest Bioethics \"Considerations Regarding Life-Prolonging Treatment for Residents of Long -Term Care Facilities\" Members of the Missouri Long-Term Care Task Force convened by Midwest Bioethics Center developed the following policy guideline s out of growing con cern about the issues surrounding life-prolonging treatment decisions for residents of long-term care facilities. Recent judicial and legislativ e actions (i.e., Cruzan, Patie nt Self-Determination Act) underscore the importance of policies that suppo rt resident-focused decision-making in long- term care facilities. However, both ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding residents' rights to accept or to refuse life-prolonging treatmen ts has led to confusion among long-term care facilities regarding policy de velopment and appropriate action. Compounding providers' confusion about residents' le gal and ethical rights is the uncertainty about regulatory sanctions. To address these problems, this doc ument is intended to provide guidance to long- term care facilities for policy development in several key areas related to life-prolonging treatment decisions, including Residents' rights; Advance directives; Surrogate decision making; Documentation of decisions; Conflict resolution; Care of residents who are dying; Hospice care. These guidelines represent the vi ews of this Task Force. Th ey have been reviewed and discussed by the Missouri Division of Aging Ethi cs in Long-Term Care Task Force. There is general concurrence with the content of these guidelines. 1. Purpose/Rationale/Goals 1.1 Provide practical guidance to long-ter m care facilities developing policies and procedures about decisions regarding life-prolonging treatment and advance directives. 1.2 Provide guidance about decision making fo r persons who lack decisional capacity and have not made advance directives. 1.3 Offer guidelines for decision-making based on systematic, rational considerations that respect the dignity and autonomy of long-term care residents. 1.4 Establish a coherent ph ilosophical/ethical foundation fo r decision-making about life- prolonging treatment and advance directives. 1.5 Provide support to individuals who are faced with making life-prolonging treatment decisions \u2014 especially decisions about withholding or withdrawing artificial nutrition and hydration. 2. Problems/Needs to be addressed 2.1 The traditional decision-making role of physicians and families/surrogates for persons without decisional capacity is unclear. 2.2 Because of legal concerns, providers a nd families/surrogates are reluctant to make healthcare decisions for persons without decisional capacity. 2.3 Policies and procedures regarding the us e of life-prolonging treatment and advance directives are needed and should be de veloped by long-term care facilities. 2.4 People involved in the decisions of l ong-term care residents need education and guidance. 3. Definitions 3.1 Advance directives \u2014 this te rm may refer to any direction ei ther written or oral that a person makes about his or her healthcare wish es prior to losing decisional capacity. Written advance directives may include living wills, healthcare treatment directives, and durable powers of attorney for health care. (For more explanation of oral directives, see section 9.) 3.2 Clinically appropriate \u2014 a treatment decision that is c onsistent with both prevailing medical standards of clini cal practice and sound ethical decision- making criteria (see 8.4.b.i-iii). 3.3 Comfort care \u2014 a range of treatments inte nded to provide relief of pain and/or suffering, control symptoms, reduce anxiety, and provide comprehensive support to residents. 3.4 Decisional capacity \u2014 term used to reflect the ability of a resident to make a specific decision, for example, the ability to unders tand relevant informa tion, to reflect on it, and to communicate (verbally or nonverbally) to providers. 3.5 Do not resuscitate (DNR) \u2014 a physician' s order protecting a re sident from cardio- pulmonary resuscitation where resuscitation has been determined either to be futile or to be inconsistent with the resi dent's values, wishes, and goals. 3.6 Durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions \u2014 a legal document that allows a person to name an agent to make health- care decisions. 3.7 Ethics committee \u2014 a multidisciplinary committee convened to integrate ethics into a healthcare providing instituti on/facility. Ethics committ ees serve three functions: education, policy review and developmen t, and case consultation. They are an advisory resource; they do not make treatment decisions. 3.8 Family \u2014 a relative or intim ate friend of the resident. 3.9 Futile \u2014 a treatment may be determined to be futile if the attending physician believes there is no reasonable expectation that the treatment will achieve its intended goal. 3.10 Hospice \u2014 a treatment approach for pe rsons who are terminally ill involving the skilled and compassionate care of dying pa tients and their fam ilies. The goals of hospice include maximizing control by the resi dent, keeping the resident pain free, and comfortable during the final phases of life. 3.11 Informed consent \u2014 agreement by a resident with decisional capacity made voluntarily and without coerci on upon a clear understanding of (1) the nature of the resident's medical condition and prognosis , (2) the nature and purpose of the proposed treatment or procedure, and (3) the benefits and burdens of proposed treatment alternatives or nontreatment. 3.12 Life-prolonging treatment \u2014 interventions th at are judged likely to be effective in prolonging the life of a resident or which ar e used simply to maintain bodily function. 3.13 Living will \u2014 a document stating a person' s wishes with regard to the use of life- sustaining (or death-prolonging) treatment in the event that the person has a terminal condition and is unable to communicate. Most states, including Missouri, have statutorily suggested forms. Use of the statutory form is not required. The term living wil l is also often used in a generic sense to refer to any document sta ting a person's healthcare treatment wishes. 3.14 Provider \u2014 professionals and agents of the facility, authori zed by law to provide healthcare. 3.15 Surrogate \u2014 an agent who acts on behalf of a resident who lacks decisional capacity to participate in a partic ular decision; an appropriate surrogate may be: a. designated by the resident (e.g., in a h ealthcare treatment direc tive, living will, or durable power of attorney); b. the adult who is most involved with th e resident and most knowledgeable about the resident's personal values and preferences; or c. designated by a court (e.g., a guardian). No priority is intended in this listing. 3.16 Terminal condition \u2014 a condition or illnes s, usually thought of as irreversible, unrelenting, and without cure, which because of its nature can be expected to cause the resident to die. 4. Identification of Ethical Principles/Values Healthcare has traditionally been based in la rge part on the assumption that human life is precious and that it should be preserved whenever possible. Th is principle is fundamental to the healthcare enterprise. However, taken as an absolu te it negates other valuable ethical principles and does not provide a full understanding of the principles that should be considered when making decisions rega rding withholding/wit hdrawing treatment. The ethical imperative for healthcare providers is to care. Caring implies balancing all essential ethical principles. 4.1 The principle of autonomy. Residents have the right to make decisions about the course of thei r lives; this is often called the right of self-determination. 4.2 The principle of beneficence. Long-term care providers have an oblig ation to avoid harming and to promote the well being of their residents. 4.3 The principle of justice/equity. All persons have a duty to respect the ri ghts of others, to obey morally acceptable laws, and to distribute limited resources fairly. 5. Working Assumptions 5.1 When a resident has refused life-prol onging treatment or when it is clinically appropriate to withdraw such treatment, h ealthcare providers have an obligation to offer treatment and care that provides for a peaceful and dignified death with minimal suffering. 5.2 If doubt exists regarding the wishes of th e resident/surrogate a bout possible benefits or burdens of a treatment when treatmen t wishes are not clea r, providers should initiate time-limited trials for a reasonable period. 5.3 When a decision to forgo a particul ar life-prolonging treatment is made, both healthcare providers and the facility ha ve a continuing obligation to provide a comprehensive range of comfort care a nd supportive treatment. The care of dying persons may be facilitate d through a hospice approach. 5.4 Healthcare providers are obligated to respect reasonabl e requests of residents/surrogates to pr ovide or to continue life-prolonging treatments. 5.5 DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) is a medical or der that should be signed by the resident's primary physician. Orders not to resuscitate should be discussed with residents who have decisional capacity or with their surrogates if they do not have decisional capacity. 5.6 Healthcare providers should respect the request of residents/surrogates for consultation and opinions from additional experts. 6. A Summary of Relevant Law and Other Legal Tenets 6.1 Constitutional law: in the Cruzan cas e, the U.S. Supreme Court acknowledged a constitutional basis for a competent person's right to refuse medical treatment, including artificial feeding, defined as a right of \"lib erty\" from unwanted medical treatment. 6.2 Federal Legislation: The Patient Self-Determination Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1991, requires nursing homes to inform their clients at the time of admission of their right to make healthcare treatment deci sions with advance di rectives. Under this legislation nursing homes are required to a. maintain written policies and proced ures concerning a person's rights under state law (whether statutory or r ecognized by the courts), to make decisions concerning their care including the right to accept or re fuse medical or surgical treatment and the right to formulate advance directives; b. ensure that this written information is provided to adult reside nts/surrogates at the time of admission; c. note in the resident's records whether an advance directive has been made by the resident; d. ensure compliance with advance dire ctives consistent with state law; e. provide staff and community e ducation on advance directives; and f. assure residents that they are not required to complete advance directives. 6.3 Missouri Statutes a. The Missouri Life Support Decl arations Act (RSMo Chapter 459.010-459.055) grants competent individuals the right to sign an advance declaration (\"statutory living will\") for withholding or withdr awing \"death prolonging procedures.\" However, a statutory living will may not direct the withholdi ng/withdrawing of food or water. Use of the statutory form is not required. Living wills, which are not in the statutory form, are sometimes referred to as \"common law living wills.\" b. A statutory living will becomes eff ective only when a declarant's medical condition is determined to be terminal and when he or she has lost decisional capacity. Terminal condition is defined in the statute as \"an incurable or irreversible condition which, in the opinion of the attending physician, is such that death will occur within a short time re gardless of the application of medical procedures.\" c. Missouri's Durable Power of Atto rney for Healthcare Law (RSMo Chapter 404.800-.865; effective August 1991) allows co mpetent individuals to designate a \"surrogate\" or \"attorney-in fact\" to make healthcare decisions for them in the event that they lack deci sional capacity as determined by two physicians unless the durable power of attorney allows decisi ons as to incapacity to be made by one physician. A surrogate must consid er the individual's medical diagnosis, prognosis, and the benefit and burdens of proposed treatmen t as well as the individual's comfort care. The authority of a surrogate to w ithhold/withdraw artifi cial food or water must be specifically provided for in the document. 6.4 Missouri Case Law: The only clearl y relevant Missouri case laws are Cruzan v. Harmon (760 SW2d 408 [Mo. 1998]) and SW2d 263 [Mo.Ct. App. 1993]). a. Cruzan a.i To be assured of legal protection, there must be clear and convincing evidence that the resident would request that artificial nutriti on and hydration be withheld or withdrawn. a.ii In addition to specific written advance directives, clear and convincing evidence may also be established by verbal statements that reflect what treatment choices a resident would make. b. Warren b.i Guardians are authorized by statut e to make healthcare treatment decisions (both to give and withhold consent) to further their wards' best interests without specific court authorizati on. Factors that may influence a determination of best interests in clude medical diagnosis and prognosis, benefits and burdens of treatment, pref erences expressed by the ward, and the probability that a course of action will lead to recovery or relief of pain. b.ii Court appointed guardians ha ve statutory authority to make healthcare decisions in their wards' best intere sts without specific court authorization. b.iii The clear and convinc ing evidence requirement in the Cruzan case should be limited to situations involving the wi thdrawal or withholding of artificial nutrition and hydration and should not c ontrol other life-sustaining care decisions. The concurring opinion in Warren emphasizes th at a court appointed guardian's authority to withho ld consent to care pertains to treatment that is unnecessary or harm ful, and that the power to consent to DNR orders without court approval is not unlimited. That is, th e power is only to be exercised when a sufficient medical basis is establis hed without regard to the patient's handicap, the social utility of the patient's li fe, or the value of that life to others. 6.5 Other Legal Tenets a. A resident's decision to forgo lif e-prolonging treatment does not constitute a decision to commit suicide. b. Requests by a resident for interventions intended to terminate his or her life should not be honored. c. Healthcare providers and/or faci lities that have an objection to a decision to forgo treatment should inform the resident or surrogate of the objection and assist in the or derly transfer of care to a nother provider or facility. d. Any medical or surgical interventi on may be withheld or withdrawn under appropriate circumstances. e. If a facility changes its policy or pr ocedures regarding the use of life-prolonging treatment, the facility has an obligation to inform its residents/surrogates of those changes and has a duty to help the resident s transfer to anothe r facility if they desire. 7. A Summary of Missouri Division of Aging Regulations 7.1 A nursing facility is required to respect the righ ts of its residents. Those rights include a. The right to be informed by a physic ian of their medical condition and prognosis (19 CSR30-88.010[10]). b. The right to be afforded the opportunity to participate in the pl anning of their care and the right to refuse treatment (19 CSR30-88.010[11]). c. The right to be transferred or discha rged only for medical reasons, or for their health or welfare or that of other residents or for nonpayment of stay (19 CSR30- 88.010[14]). 7.2 The operator and administrator of a nursi ng facility have a res ponsibility to provide protective oversight to the resi dents of that facility and to assure that they receive appropriate nursing and medical car e (19 CSR 30-85.042[3] & [67]). 7.3 A nursing facility is required to devel op policies and procedur es for dealing with medical emergency treatment procedures, admission and discharge procedures, and resident rights' issues. (19 CSR 30-85.042[13]). The facility 's staff, all physicians with residents in the facility, and each resident must be informed of those policies and procedures. Facilities are re quired to relate information about advance directives to residents/surrogates on an annual basis (19 CSR 30-85.042[15] & [42] and also 19 CSR 30-88.010 [9]). 7.4 A nursing facility is required to meet th e nutritional needs of a resident based on the individual's circumstances, medical condition, and goals of treatment as determined and justified by the physician (19 CSR 30-85.052 [1]). 8. General Guidelines for Decision Making 8.1 Model of Decision-Making Process a. Long-term care residents have the ri ght to accept or refuse any health care treatment. b. Informed decisions must incl ude participation by providers and residents/surrogates. c. Treatment decisions may be changed at a ny time if it is appropriate in view of a reassessment or change in the condition of the resident. The resident/surrogate should be involved in the decision. 8.2 Role of the Resident a. Residents with decisional capacity: A dults with decisional capacity have the right to accept or refuse any medical interventi on. These rights are not restricted to residents who are terminally ill. Residents who have been adjudicated incompetent or diagnosed as having a mental illness or mental retardation may have the ability to make some, if not all, healthcare treatment decisions. b. Residents who have advance directives: If a resident who has an advance directive stating his or her treatment preferences is currently without decisional capacity, his or her directive should be followed. c. Residents without decisional capacit y and without advance directives: When possible, appropriate surroga tes should be identified to act on the resident's behalf. The legal authority of surrogates who have not been formally appointed by an advance directive or a court or der may be open to challenge. c.i An appropriate surrogate is one who is a ppointed in the durable power of attorney, and has personal knowledge of the resident's goals and values. He or she must be willing to act on behalf of the resident. c.ii In many instances a family member wi ll be an appropriate surrogate, but even when there is family, close friends or othe rs may be better suited for this role. c.iii An adult who has lived with the resi dent prior to the resident being admitted to a long-term care facility may be gi ven priority as a surrogate decision maker. For example, a person living with his or her spouse (or partner) may speak for his or her spouse (or partner). c.iv Each facility should establish polic ies and procedures describing their internal process for recognizing an appropriate surrogate. Ethics committees may be helpful in this process. c.v Requesting a court appointed guardia n should be an option of last resort. 8.3 Role of Surrogate Decision Makers fo r Residents without De cisional Capacity a. Appropriate surrogates should partic ipate in decision making for persons who lack decisional capacity. b. Surrogates named in durable powers of attorney for healthcare decisions: b.i Generally, surrogates have the same aut hority as the resident would have if he or she had decisional capacity. b.ii Missouri law requires that a surrogat e's authority to withhold or withdraw artificially administer ed nutrition and hydration be expressly provided. c. Surrogates named in durable powers of attorney signed before August 1991: c.i May or may not have legal authority to make healthcare decisions unless the durable power of attorney specifi cally contains that authority. c.ii Prior to August 1991, many people who are now long-term care residents signed durable power of attorney do cuments which did not specifically mention healthcare decision making or decisions about withholding/withdrawing artifici al nutrition and hydration. c.iii The criteria provided in this document for selecting an \"appropriate surrogate\" should be applie d to persons named in these durable powers of attorney. d. Surrogates named in nondurable powers of attorney: d.i Do not have legal authority to make decisions of any kind for persons without decisional capacity. d.ii Although not legally authorized by a nondurable power of attorney, surrogates named in nondurable powers of attorney may still be appropriate surrogates. e. Court Appointed Guardians e.i The scope of authority of the guardia n in Missouri is determined by the court order. e.ii If a guardian has been appointed, f acilities should request a copy of the court order and make it part of the resident's permanent record. e.iii Guardians in Missouri must have \"clear and convincing\" evidence that they are acting in a manner consistent with the resident's wishes regarding withholding/withdrawing artificially administered nutri tion and hydration. e.iv When a guardian has been appointe d, before a provider/facility chooses to recognize the decision of a surrogate ot her than a court a ppointed guardian, the guardian must be notified of th is decision (See section, 8.3.f.). f. Surrogates recognized by providers/fac ilities but not appointed by a resident's advance directive or court order should sh are in the decision- making process with the physician, family, and repres entatives of the facility. g. Ethics committees can assist in resolvi ng conflicts that may arise between various recognizable surrogates and court appointed guardians. 8.4 Surrogate Decision-Making Criteria a. Substituted judgment decisions: If th e providers and surrogate agree that the treatment decision is in accord with the resident's values and previously expressed preferences, that plan of care should be pursued. b. Best interest decisions: If the providers and surrogate don't know or cannot agree about what the resident would choose, then decisions should be based on what reasonable persons in the resident's position would choose. For example: b.i In applying the best interest standard to residents who are terminally ill, major considerations are the bu rden of prolonging dying and whether the resident has the potential benefit of achieving some satisfaction from prolonged life. b.ii In applying the best interest standa rd to residents who have a severe and irreversible illness or condition, the d ecision should be made by balancing the benefits and burdens to the resident in each case. b.iii In applying the best interest standard to the resident with an irreversible loss of consciousness, considerat ion of the benefits and bur dens to the caretakers and family are also appropriate. 8.5 Role of Healthcare Providers a. A provider's primary respons ibility is to the resident. b. Decisions to forgo life-prolonging tr eatment must be resident focused. c. Providers' responsibilities include c.i Fully informing the resident/surr ogate regarding the resident's medical condition and prognosis to the extent in formation is available and involving the resident/surrogate in th e decision-making process. c.ii Recognizing and honoring resident s' healthcare treatme nt preferences. c.iii Ensuring that comprehensive an d accurate evaluation of the resident's condition occurs on an ongoing basis. c.iv Considering the entire rang e of reasonable treatment options. c.v Considering and conducting ther apeutic trials wh en appropriate. c.vi Respecting requests made by th e resident/surrogate for additional consultation. c.vii Determining whether the loss of d ecisional capacity is due to temporary or reversible conditions, for example, depression caused by medication. c.viii Informing other providers of any decision to forgo or withdraw life- prolonging treatment. 8.6 Role of the Facility The responsibilities of the facility include: a. Ensuring that appropriate care is prov ided to residents in accordance with the resident/surrogate's wishes. b. Informing residents/surrogates of th eir rights and promoting those rights. c. Making reasonable efforts to gather in formation about the resident's life, goals and values, medical history, and the ex istence of any advance directive. d. Supporting the resident's right to ma ke autonomous decisions, including the resident's right to make, change , or revoke advance directives. e. Ensuring that residents/surrogates have all the available information regarding the resident's diagnosis, treatment options, risk s and benefits associ ated with various treatment options, and the resident's prognosis. f. Verifying that loss of de cisional capacity is not due to temporary or reversible conditions, for example, depression caused by medication. g. Verifying that residents are free from co ercion so that they may make an informed and autonomous decision. h. Having appropriate policies and procedures in place to protect residents' rights to make treatment decisions. i. Facilitating consultation with the inte rdisciplinary care team or ethics committee when decisions are made to forgo life-pr olonging treatment fo r residents without advance directives or appropriate surrogates. j. Providing a mechanism for conflict resolution. 8.7 Conflict Resolution a. Disagreements may arise between reside nt/surrogate and hea lthcare providers, among members of the interd isciplinary team, or betw een the primary decision makers and the facility itself. When such conflict occurs, it is imperative that the parties have access to the widest range of mechanisms to address and attempt to resolve such conflict. These mechanisms include a.i additional medical consultation; a.ii care a.v assistance from the ombudsman program; and/or a.vi review by an ethics committee. b. One of the ways a long-term care facil ity can discharge its responsibilities for supporting residents making these difficult decisions is through the creation and support of an institutional ethics committee. b.i Ethics committees can assist facilitie s to address these issues proactively by promoting education about ethics an d assisting with policy review and development. b.ii A primary role of the ethics comm ittee is that of pr oviding a forum where questions and/or disagreements regard ing decisions about life-sustaining treatment can be discussed and resolved. b.iii Committee consultation and review may be undertaken in response to a formal request by a resident, family/surr ogate, or provider directly involved in the care of the resident. b.iv Consultation should be strongly considered in cases in which an appropriate surrogate cannot be identified for a reside nt without decision al capacity and in cases in which there is persistent disagreement among those responsible for making decisions. c. Smaller long-term care facilities may c onsider collaboration w ith other healthcare provider organizations in order to assemble appropriate resources for the development of an ethics committee. d. Resolution through litiga tion should only be an option of last resort. 9. Documentation 9.1 All discussions regarding decisions about withholding or withdrawing life-prolonging medical treatment must be documented in the resident's medical record. a. Discussion with residents about their ri ghts to choose or re fuse treatment should be encouraged. b. Staff should be educated to note all such conversations in the re sident's chart; the notation should include what the resi dent said, when, and with whom the conversation was had. c. Residents with decisional capacity who state specific tr eatment preferences should be encouraged to make written advance directives. d. Procedures should be deve loped for storing this inform ation so that it is easily retrievable. 9.2 Documentation regarding th e process of selecting a su rrogate not appointed by the resident is recommended. 9.3 Documentation of a resident's decisi ons to forgo life-prolonging treatment should include a. orders necessary to implement such decisions; b. the basis for making the decision; c. the process by which the decision was ma de, for example, \"after consultation with the resident\" or \"after consultation with the family\" or \"in co nsultation with the ethics committee;\" and d. notice that all persons di rectly involved in the care of the resident have been informed about decisions to fo rgo life-prolonging treatment. 9.4 If a resident has an adva nce directive, it must be part of the resident's permanent medical record. Keep the directives in a de signated location within the record to make them easily accessible. a. Federal legislation and state regulation requires that at the time of admission long- term care residents/surrogates must be info rmed of their rights to choose or refuse any medical or surgical intervention consiste nt with state law and of their right to make advance directives. b. When admitting a resident from the car e of another facility, institution, or organization, the long-term care facility should request a copy of any advance directive in the resident's r ecords at the time of transfer. b.i The resident/surrogate should be informed that a copy of the directive has been transferred to the facility. b.ii The resident should be asked to confirm that the doc ument appropriately represents his or her treatment preferences. b.iii Conversely, when transferring residents to the hospital or to another facility, a copy of their advance directive should be transported with them. c. It must be noted in the resident's reco rd whether or not he or she has an advance directive, and if they are presented with a document, facilities must make the document part of the resident's permanent record. However, so long as a resident maintains decisional capacity, an advance directive has no effect. d. If the resident is incapab le of receiving information regarding advance directives, information about advance directives s hould be presented to the resident's surrogate. However, guardians or surrogates may not complete advance directives on behalf of the resident. e. If a resident regains decisional capac ity, information about advance directives should be given to the re sident at that time. f. Facilities should discuss the right of self-determination (i ncluding the right to make advance directives) at least annually with all residents who have decisional capacity. g. Facilities should provide assistance to residents who express interest in completing an advance directive. h. Although having information provided in an advance directive (particularly the designation of a surrogate in a durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions) is extremely valuable to long-term care facilities, reside nts may not be required to complete an advance directive. i. Long-term care facilities are required to develop a process whereby residents with decisional capacity are given an opportunity to review their directives at least annually (13 CSR 15-18.010 [9]). j. Because of limitations on some older documents, for example, the terminal condition requirement in statutory living wills, facilities should offer to the resident more updated forms of advan ce directives such as a Healthcare Treatment Directive. k. Residents/surrogates should be inform ed of new legislation (either state or federal) that may affect their rights to make healthcare treatment decisions. 9.5 Do Not Resuscitate Orders (e.g., DNR Orders, No Code Orders, No Code Blue Orders, Pre-Hospitalized Do Not Resuscitate Request Forms, Outside the Hospital Do Not Resuscitate Request Forms) a. DNR is a medical order for an indi vidual resident that applies to cardio- pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) only. a.i It requires a physician's signature after discussion with a resident with decisional capacity. (No othe r signature is required.) a.ii The medical record should in clude the rationale for the decision. a.iii Residents with decisional capac ity should always be involved in DNR decisions. a.iv DNR orders for persons without de cisional capacity should be discussed with surrogates, and families should be info rmed of a decision to initiate a DNR order and of the rationale for making the order. However, their permission is not required. a.v If there is no appropriate surrogate and CPR is deemed to be medically futile or clinically inappropria te, a decision to enter a DNR order can be made providing such a decision is with in prevailing medical standards. b. Advance directives and DNR orders are separate documents with separate purposes and one should not be confused for the other. c. A determination to enter a DNR order may be based on c.i A resident's wishes after medical consultation, for example, a resident does not want CPR due to his/her perceived poor quality of life; c.ii Preferences stated in and consistent with an incapacitated resident's advance directive; c.iii Direction provided by a legally au thorized agent after medical consultation, for example, durable power of attorney; and/or c.iv A determination by the physician that the treatment would be futile or clinically inappropriate for a resident without decisional capacity or an advance directive. 9.6 Transfer Orders a. A resident/surrogate may request tran sfer from a long-term care facility at any time and for any reason including a treatment decision that is inconsistent with a policy or the mission of a facility. The facility has an obligation to assist in the orderl y transfer of that resident to another facility or location. b. Residents have a right to refuse hospita lization and residents' /surrogates' requests not to transfer should be honored. 10. General Guidelines for the Care of Dying Persons 10.1 Palliative care should be provided to dying persons. 10.2 Physical care should be direct ed by a plan of care that reco gnizes that the resident is dying. 10.3 Areas of special concern are pain medication, nutrition and hydration, and DNR orders. 10.4 Pain medications should s upport the goals of treatment. a. Most often when caring for a resident who is terminally ill, the primary goal is to alleviate the pain and suffering of the resident as he or she describes it. b. Some residents may choose to endure su ffering in order to be more alert; other residents may choose to be sedated in order to experience less pain. c. Addiction to narcotics is not a legitimate concern. Drug dependency is appropriate for a person experiencing persistent pain and is not the same as drug addiction. 10.5 The nutrition and hydration needs of each resident should be based on one's wishes, medical condition, and the goal s of treatment as determined by the physician. a. Food and water should continue to be o ffered as needed or de sired (not just at meal times) to dying persons. b. Food and fluids should always be pr ovided to any person who requests them. However, it is inappropriate to force feed a resident against his or her wishes. (Force feeding include s syringe feeding.) c. It is inappropriate to threaten resident s with tube feeding if they refuse to eat. d. Appropriate mouth care is importa nt for persons who are dehydrated. 10.6 Psychological, social, and spiritual needs of residents, families, and care providers are of primary importance and should be addressed in the plan of care. a. Needs and desires of the dying resident should be the primary concern rather than strict adherence to institutional rules. b. Staff need to be supported in assisting residents to meet these needs as well as their physical needs. c. Psychological, social, and spiritual se rvices should reflect the resident/family's expressed wishes. 10.7 Bereavement support should be provi ded for survivors and caregivers. a. For the benefit of other residents, it is important to acknowledge death. b. Staff should have an opportunity to di scuss and affirm their feelings about a resident's death. c. Residents should also have an opportun ity to discuss and affirm their feelings about this experience. Conclusion The process that led to the development of these guidelines involved collaboration among many individuals with diverse backgrounds. Th e guidelines themselves provide relevant ethical, legal, medical, nursing, regulatory, psychological, social , and spiritual considerations to help long-term care faciliti es develop resident-focused pol icies concerning life-prolonging treatments. They reflect the importance of a common sense, resident-focused, interdisciplinary team approach to decision ma king in long-term care f acilities. There are no simple solutions to these difficult decisions. The Task Force recommends that the decision- making process in long-term car e facilities be expanded beyon d legalistic and regulatory concerns to embrace the resident-focused consider ations that are set forth in this document.
