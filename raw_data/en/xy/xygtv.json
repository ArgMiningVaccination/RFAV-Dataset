COVID-19 Vaccine Update: Frequently Asked Questions Q: Are the COVID-19 vaccines safe? A: Yes. Like other vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines must go through multiple phases of rigorous testing, analysis, and review as they are developed. This ensures that the vaccines meet high safety and efficacy standards. Before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for emergency use authorization, they sought recommendations from a multidisciplinary team of experts, including independent medical officers, microbiologists, chemists, epidemiologists, and other health experts. Although the speed of COVID-19 vaccine development was faster than typical, no step in the process was skipped. For additional information on frequently asked questions related to the vaccine, see [these UI Health Care COVID-19 vaccine resources.](https://link.uiowa.edu/l/927e6b30-46ae-4d9a-9897-d6657a99db83?m=2e16b6cd-6845-4eef-aac6-1a6571909028&c=d.vpsc&i=202102) For campus vaccine updates, see the [UI's COVID-19 Vaccine Information page](https://link.uiowa.edu/l/f11b8723-b6ed-424e-8036-573c4e0305ad?m=2e16b6cd-6845-4eef-aac6-1a6571909028&c=d.vpsc&i=202102). Be Aware of COVID-19 Scams The University of Iowa is asking its community members to beware of scammers looking to take advantage of you during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many emerging scams can compromise your personal information. Read below for information on how to curb COVID-19 scammers and always be sure to rely on official government/reputable websites for information. Phishing Scams - Phishers\u2014cybercriminals who trick people into providing passwords or personal information\u2014seize opportunities like vaccination campaigns to send fraudulent email or other types of messages. Vigilance is key to stopping phishing. Beware of messages that ask you to provide passwords, account numbers, etc., or direct you to unfamiliar websites. Don't open email attachments unless you're confident they are from someone you know. Trust your instincts\u2014if an email looks suspicious in any way, delete it. [Learn more about phishing](https://link.uiowa.edu/l/772883c0-c3ca-4753-b138-6481cbd3dcee?m=2e16b6cd-6845-4eef-aac6-1a6571909028&c=d.vpsc&i=202102) and see real examples of phishing attacks. Recognize Robo calls or Text Messages - Be suspicious about any unexpected calls or text messages regarding COVID-19 tests, supplies, or information. Do not respond, or open hyperlinks in, text messages about COVID-19 from unknown individuals. Don't Share Your Vaccine Card on Social Media - By sharing your vaccination card on social media, you are sharing your full name, birthday, and where you received your vaccine with scammers who can steal your identity or even create fake vaccination cards. Be careful how you share news of your inoculation with the rest of the world. Instead, share a photo of your vaccine sticker or set a frame around your profile picture. Beware of Contact Tracing Scammers - Be prepared to know the difference between a real contact tracer and a scammer. Real contact tracers ask for health information and do not need money or personal financial information. If you encounter a similar situation, remove yourself from the conversation. Be Wary of Ads for Test Kits - Watch out for non-FDA-approved COVID-19 test kits. Many at-home kits are not accurate and don't provide the accurate and rapid results you are seeking. Identify Fake Emails - Be careful of emails claiming to be from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or World Health Organization (WHO). Use sites like [gov](https://link.uiowa.edu/l/f2752956-1ab4-4bd9-8c49-6a9fd17819a7?m=2e16b6cd-6845-4eef-aac6-1a6571909028&c=d.vpsc&i=202102)and [usa.gov/coronavirus](https://link.uiowa.edu/l/ef30a7a3-8fbc-41f3-af45-8a203313db45?m=2e16b6cd-6845-4eef-aac6-1a6571909028&c=d.vpsc&i=202102)for the latest information.
