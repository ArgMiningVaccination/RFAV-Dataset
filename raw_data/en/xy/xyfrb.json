This degree requires a minimum of 90 credits beyond the baccalaureate degree. Doctoral programs leading to Ph.D. are offered in all five departments and the five core areas of public health. Students have an opportunity to specialize within their department. Each department has written specific guidelines and there are collegewide PhD student competencies. Students and their major advisor jointly create a written plan to meet all competencies via plan of study, research experience, departmental and professional activities, and other appropriate methods. The courses and number of credit hours required are defined by the Department and the doctoral committee. Coursework includes the Ph.D. core courses, three semesters of a onecredited hour college wide Advanced Interdisciplinary Seminar in Public Health, coursework from another department or college, and a minimum of 13 credits at the 7000 level. Generally, the doctoral degree requires a minimum of 90 credits beyond the bachelor's degree. There is a mandatory doctoral student orientation that all new doctoral students must attend in the fall semester of their first academic year.

Emphasis will be placed on proficiency in policy development and health policy strategies, public health leadership and management of health programs. Demonstration of applied research skills and strength in evaluation methods via practicebased specialized study will be expected. The Dr.P.H. will require 90 semester hours beyond the baccalaureate degree. Candidates will have an M.P.H. or equivalent degree prior to admission, therefore the actual additional hours required for the Dr.P.H. beyond the Master's level will average 45 to 50 semester hours, depending upon the program designed by the student and his or her committee. Per University guidelines, all requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within seven calendar years from the student's date of admission for doctoral study. Students have four years to complete all required coursework, pass the qualifying examination, and be admitted to doctoral candidacy. Students then have four years from the date of doctoral candidacy to complete degree requirements.

Public health professionals can better perform these functions through not only obtaining the prerequisite knowledge but also through partnering with welltrained professionals in other fields such as law to develop and implement society's responses to public health needs. However, lawyers' effectiveness is often limited by their inadequate knowledge of public health and its scientific disciplines. The joint degree program is intended to supply this knowledge by giving public health and Stetson Law School graduates a sound education in both law and public health. A related goal is to increase the opportunities for interdisciplinary research, teaching, and advocacy for the faculties at the College of Public Health and Stetson University College of Law.

ADMISSION INFORMATION Must meet University requirements (see Graduate Admissions) as well as requirements listed below. Program Admission Requirements Students will need to be accepted to both institutions and follow the admission standards of each setting. Students must complete the GRE and the LSAT for acceptance into this dual program. Refer to the M.P.H. listing for specific USF admission requirements. DEGREE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS College of Public Health Students : Students in the College of Public Health will enroll in the J.D./M.P.H. program, complete the M.P.H. degree, and meet the admission requirements of Stetson which includes taking the LSAT, and then enroll in the Stetson College of Law to complete the JD. Students in the dual degree program will be permitted to count nine hours of credit from the M.P.H. program toward satisfaction of JD credit requirements, and up to nine hours of credit from the JD program toward satisfaction of M.P.H. credit requirements. All students in the dual degree program must complete a field experience requirement. Students in Stetson Law must do mandatory pro bono work (20 hours). Some of these hours may qualify for the field experience however these must be done in a public health setting. This will be determined by the student's public health advisor and department. Credit hours for the M.P.H. may be more than 42 hours (i.e. 46 hours) depending on the concentration program. Stetson Law Students : Students already enrolled in Stetson College of Law will normally apply for the dual degree program in their first or second year. Students in the program will usually complete either one or two years of law school, after which they will spend a year completing the M.P.H. program in the College of Public Health. Students will have the ability to choose whichever concentration within the College that best meets their interests and needs and which they are formally accepted to by the College and Department. After completing their M.P.H., students will return to Stetson to complete their JD and prepare for the bar exam. The virtue of this study plan is that students will commence M.P.H. study with a sound foundation in law and legal process, and students will complete the elective portion of their legal study with a sound foundation in public health.

USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Public Health (Dr.P.H.) 783 http://health.usf.edu/publichealth/ PreDissertation Committee All Dr.P.H. students are admitted into the College of Public Health Dr.P.H. will be assigned a faculty advisor (see above) and a Dr.P.H. practicebased Mentor who will work with the student in forming a predissertation committee. The roles of the predissertation committee are as follows: 1. Meet with the student to discuss plan of study, practicebase specialized study, and academic progress. The Program of Study should include proposed time schedule to complete each course, and copies shall be given to each committee member and to the Office of Academic and Student Affairs. 2. Facilitate opportunities for strengthening leadership and management skills, applied research skills and scholarly growth. 3. Administer and evaluate the qualifying exam. Dissertation Committee Successful completion of the preliminary examination advances the doctoral student to a doctoral candidate. At that time, the student will convene a Dr.P.H. Dissertation Committee. The PreDissertation Committee may continue to serve as the Dissertation Committee, although this not necessary. At this time, the student may desire to change Faculty Advisor and/or committee members. This may occur when practice, professional or research interests are more closely matched with another faculty member, the student and faculty member mutually agree that another person is more appropriate, or a faculty member is leaving the University. This action is to be approved by the Department Chair, the Dean of Academic and Student Affairs, and the Office of Graduate Studies. The Dissertation Committee must have a minimum of four members, which includes at least two faculty members from the College of Public Health and a public health professional or practitioner. Refer to Office of Graduate Studies guidelines for information on the chair appointed for the dissertation defense. A minimum of 9 dissertation credits is required.

Provide guidance and support during dissertation 4. Evaluate dissertation through dissertation defense process. 5. Recommend an appropriate chair for the dissertation defense. Use of \"c\" in Degree Acronyms for Degree Candidates The College of Public Health does not permit students who are pursuing masters or doctoral degrees to use the degree acronym after their names and a small \"c\" for candidate. In other words students are not permitted to use MPHc, MSPHc, MHA, PhDc, or DrPHc. If students, after successfully completing all comprehensive exams (core and concentration) for the master degrees or the qualifying exam for the doctoral degree wish to put after their name the words \"master degree candidate\" or \"doctoral degree candidate*\" - we allow this. The use of the degree acronym and small \"c\" creates confusion for faculty, employers, and other individuals who are reviewing students' CVS and other materials. It creates a situation wherein a student appears to have earned a degree when such is not the case. As a degreegranting College, we do not allow this. *Editor's note: the use of \"doctoral degree candidates\" should only be done after Admission to Doctoral Candidacy has been processed and approved through the Office of Graduate Studies.
