People use them for everything from [promoting relaxation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26473822/) to helping their teenager's room smell less like sweaty gym socks. Whatever the reason you consider using them, there is no shortage of oils from which to choose. In fact, the long list of choices can seem overwhelming, especially for aromatherapy newbies. To help you out, I have prepared a list of my top 20 aromatherapy oils and some tips for when to them. Before we dive into my list, some of you may be wondering what aromatherapy is and why so many people are into it. The simple explanation of aromatherapy is that it is the art of using essential oils for emotional and physical healing. Poor lifestyle choices and environmental contaminants can disrupt the body's natural balance. Using the proper essential oils can help restore that balance. That is the premise behind aromatherapy. Think of it as a form of therapy. As more and more people seek natural alternatives to over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications, a growing number of them turn to aromatherapy. I use it to help control pain from a chronic condition and to relieve my anxiety. The name (aroma-therapy) implies that essential oils must be inhaled. This is not the case. Many people find it most convenient to diffuse essential oils and inhale them. However, you can mix them into pure pharmaceutical grade almond oil or shea butter, and apply them directly to your skin. Essential oils are the \"ingredients\" of aromatherapy. They come from compounds extracted from plants known to support health and well-being. Inhaling the aromatic fumes of essential oils stimulates the [limbic system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917081/). That is the part of your brain responsible for your behaviors, emotions, long-term memory, and your sense of smell. The limbic system also plays a huge part in forming memories, which helps explain why inhaling some essential oils can trigger our memories or emotions. Say you have fond memories of baking cookies with your grandma. Her favorite recipe was lemon shortbreads. Every time you smell lemons, you are transported back to a happy time when you baked those cookies together. [Essential oil aromatherapy](https://www.alliance-aromatherapists.org/aromatherapy) may seem like it is suddenly new and exciting, but the practice has existed for more than 6,000 years. Ancient Egyptian healers placed small herbal cones under a patient's headdress. As the cones melted, the essential oils were absorbed into the patient's scalp. In pre-Columbian Mexico, the sick visited healing huts with hot, indoor water pools. Healers placed medicinal flowers, leaves, and herbs on rocks throughout the pools. As the steam penetrated the plants, vapors were released into the air in a form of aromatherapy. More recently, French chemist Rene-Maurice Gattefosse discovered the healing powers of lavender oil. In 1910, his hand was badly burned in a lab accident, and he applied lavender oil to the injured areas of his skin. What he discovered was the oil helped his burns heal quickly and without scarring. It was quite the happy accident - one that prompted Gattefosse to devote the remainder of his career to investigating the chemical properties of essential oils. Gattefosse was not the last scientist to study essential oils. Several studies demonstrate the science behind essential oils and their plant-based compounds. [Johns Hopkins researchers](https://hub.jhu.edu/2018/12/04/lyme-disease-treatment-essential-oils/) discovered essential oils from garlic and herbs kill persistent Lyme disease bacteria. Other researchers linked lavender with improved sleep and [peppermint](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4316718/) with migraine pain relief. These are just a few of the evidence-based research studies proving the effectiveness of aromatherapy. Top picks for best aromatherapy essential oils As promised, here are my top 20 picks for aromatherapy. Please remember that young children can have adverse reactions to essential oils. Johns Hopkins University has compiled a list of [do's and don'ts](https://www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/ACH-News/General-News/Are-Essential-Oils-Safe-for-Children) when using aromatherapy with youngsters, to help ensure their safety. People with severe asthma and chronic lung disease should avoid aromatherapy, as it can aggravate symptoms. My last word of warning is for pregnant women to avoid basil, marjoram, sage, and large amounts of peppermint essential oils. For everyone else, here are some of the best essential oils to try in your next aromatherapy session. Before you start using aromatherapy yourself, I highly recommend getting a few books about essential oils. The best resources include extensive background on the science behind aromatherapy, coupled with some pointers for using essential oils safely. Here are two of my favorites: If you are nervous about mixing essential oils safely, you can choose pre-blended aromatherapy inhalers. Among some of the best is [AromaWorks Aromatherapy Pocket Inhalers](https://amazing-solutions.com/search?type=article%2Cpage%2Cproduct&q=AromaWorks*+Aromatherapy*+Pocket*+Inhalers*).
