A fever of 103.5 degrees Fahrenheit technically sits on the border between a common fever and a high fever. It often requires home treatment, but a doctor's visit may not be necessary unless your child displays other disconcerting symptoms. Fever Symptoms KidsHealth explains that fevers occur when the hypothalamus -- the body's internal thermostat -- raises the body's temperature in response to an infection or other internal threat [5](http://kidshealth.org/parent/general/body/fever.html). As such, a fever is only a symptom of illness rather than an illness itself, but fevers often cause additional symptoms [4](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fever/DS00077/DSECTION=symptoms). According to MayoClinic.com, other common symptoms associated with fevers include: - sweating - shivering - headache - body ache - loss of appetite - general weakness [4](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fever/DS00077/DSECTION=symptoms) A fever of 103.5 may also cause hallucinations, frustration, convulsions and dehydration.
