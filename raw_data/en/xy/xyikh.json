Let us help you unlock those by way of breathwork and spiritual coaching. Conscious breathwork helps to activate the subconscious mind and bring awareness and insights not easily accessed through traditional therapy. Breath opens the energy channels in the body and allows what we have been holding onto to surface and be released. This session will include client consultation, breathwork, and a myriad of spiritual coaching techniques (will vary based on client needs). Offered in-person and via Zoom. 60-90 min. $135-$150 The Desert Journey Sound Bath- GROUPS ONLY Our Sound Baths are led by certified Reiki Masters were Reiki energy is channeled during your sound healing session. We combine sound therapy using an array of sound instruments (i.e. crystal alchemy bowls, etc.) and a guided meditation in this signature group experience. **THIS IS AVAILABLE FOR HOUSE CALLS ONLY** Please inquire for group pricing. Ayurvedic Head & Heart Ritual Our Ayurvedic inspired self-love treatment calms the mind and opens the heart to bring calmness and clarity in your healing journey. We begin with using warm herbal infused oils that are anointed and massaged over the head and scalp to release tension and unwind the mind. We then move our focus to the neck, shoulders, and chest where so much tension is held to soften and open the heart center. Gua sha & kansa wands are then used with healing oils to encourage lymphatic drainage followed by a ritual foot massage. We incorporate Tibetan bowls and Reiki throughout the treatment to rebalance your Qi and Chakras "}
