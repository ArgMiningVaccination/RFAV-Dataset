I am a doctor of Naturopathic Medicine and a certified massage therapist. I received a certification in massage therapy from Sister Gefre School and Clinics of Massage in Mankato Minnesota in 2007 and doctorate degree in Naturopathic Medicine from National University of Health Sciences in Lombard Illinois in 2020. I am uniquely qualified to help support natural and effective therapies for a wide range of health conditions from autoimmune disorders to seasonal allergies. I am highly motivated to help support overall wellness, lifestyle changes, and nutritional counseling. My own journey started as a kid when I knew I wanted to be a doctor. I have always been drawn to this type of healthcare, which began my educational journey. I finished massage therapy in 2007 and a few years later realized that I wanted to learn more and offer more to my patients. That is when I started to look for schools that offered Naturopathic medicine and I enrolled at National University of Health Sciences in 2014. What I offer at Herbal Health & Wellness is what I practice in my personal life from eating healthy to taking care of my spiritual health. I enjoy taking walks, sewing, and doing things with my family. Botanical Tincture A Botanical tincture is a concentrated herbal extract that can be made from berries, bark, roots and leaves.
