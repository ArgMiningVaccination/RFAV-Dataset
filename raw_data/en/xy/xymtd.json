Clinical Phase: Phase 1 Rationale: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRIs) that result in hospital visits during infancy and early childhood. In the United States, more than 60% of infants are infected by RSV during t heir first RSV season, and nearly all have been infected by two to three years of age ( Breese, 2010; Glezen et al., 1986) . Approximately 2.1 million US children less than five years of age are treated for RSV disease each year: 3% as inpatients, 25% in eme rgency departments, and 73% in pediatric practices ( Hall et al., 2009 ). Disease burden is similar in Europe, with more than 1% of all children less than three years of age hospitalized annually and more than 7% receiving outpatient medical care ( Forster et al., 2004 ). Globally, among children less than five years of age, RSV causes an estimated 33.8 million ALRIs each year (more than 22% of all ALRIs), resulting in 66,000 -199,000 deaths, 99% of which occur in developing countries ( Nair et al., 2010 ). In add ition, RSV is a common cause of respiratory disease among the elderly, resulting in as many hospitalizations as influenza in a heavily influenza -immunized population ( Falsey et al., 2005 ). RSV spreads by respiratory droplets and close contact with infected persons or contaminated objects. In temperate climates there is an annual winter epidemic ( Brandt et al., 1973 ), while in tropical areas seasonality is less distinct, but infection is most common during the rainy season ( Weber et al., 1998 ). Infants are at highest risk for severe RSV disease in their first six months ( Iwane et al., 2004; Hall et al., 2009 ), and hospitalization peaks at two to three months of age ( Parrott et al., 1973 ). Pret erm birth and cardiopulmonary disease are risk factors for severe disease, with 33.8% of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia hospitalized for RSV in their first year of life ( Boyce et al., 2000 ). Bronchiolitis is the classic presentation, but RSV also causes pneumonia, rhinitis, and otitis media. Severe RSV infection in infancy is associated with higher rates PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 3 of 115 Confidential Name of Sponsor Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics Protocol number: V122_01 Health authority trial number(s): EudraCT No. 2014 -000145 -69 BB-IND No. TBD of asthma later in childhood ( Stein et al., 1999; Wu & Hartert, 2011 ). Recommended treatment of RSV bronchiolitis consists primarily of respiratory support and hydration (Subcommittee on diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis, 2006 ). No specific anti - viral therapy is recommended. The neutralizing monoclonal antibody (m Ab), Palivizumab\u00ae, is used for prophylaxis of infants at highest risk for severe RSV disease, and although the monoclonal antibody can protect these infants, it is too expensive and impractical for universal use ( Prescott et al., 2010 ). Induction of neutra lizing antibody (NAb) should be the primary goal of vaccination because the severity of RSV disease is largely determined by the extent of viral replication ( Graham, 2011 ). Although developing a safe and effective RSV vaccine is a global public health prio rity and will have a significant impact on RSV prevention, there is no licensed RSV vaccine. Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics (NVD) has developed an investigational RSV subunit vaccine from an engineered recombinant RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein. The clinical program will evaluate the feasibility of passively protecting infants by immunizing pregnant women with the RSV F subunit vaccine. If maternal immunization during 24 to 32 weeks of gestation increases antibody titers eight -fold, the median peak of RSV disease in infants would be delayed from its current peak at two to three months of age to a new peak at approximately five to six months of age. This delay could significantly decrease the burden of RSV disease in infants in the first months of life and open an RSV disease -free interval during which active immunization of infants could further extend protection beyond six months of age. In the current study, we will test one dosage of the investigational RSV F subunit vaccine that is presumed to be below t he dosage -response plateau (to establish that a maximal neutralizing antibody response cannot be achieved with a low dosage) and two higher dosages (to either establish the dosage -response plateau or indicate that higher dosages are needed in a subsequent study to reach the plateau). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of the investigational RSV F subunit vaccine administered intramuscularly (IM). In this current Phase 1, first -in-human study, the three diffe rent antigen amounts that have been selected will be evaluated in a stepwise manner in three different cohorts (cohort 1: low dosage of RSV F subunit vaccine [45 \u00b5g], cohort 2: middle dosage of RSV F subunit vaccine [90 \u00b5g], and cohort 3: high dosage of RS V F subunit vaccine [135 \u00b5g]). In addition, the effect of an adjuvant, either aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH) 3] or MF59, and antibody kinetics post -vaccination at different time points will be evaluated as compared PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 4 of 115 Confidential Name of Sponsor Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics Protocol number: V122_01 Health authority trial number(s): F subunit at the same dosage levels.

To characterize the serum neutralizing antibody (NAb) and binding antibody responses against additional RSV strains and native or engineered RSV antigens at baseline and following vaccination in a subset of subjects. 2. To determine the frequency of B cells s pecific for RSV proteins in a subset of subjects, and subsequently, explore the baseline immunity to RSV and the immune response to the RSV F subunit vaccine by analyzing the RSV -specific B -cell repertoire in a selected group of the subset of subjects. Methodology: Study Design: In total, approximately 288 healthy non -pregnant female and male adults (18 to 45 years of age) will be enrolled in the study in the ratio of 3:1. There is a higher ratio of female to male subjects because the RSV F subunit vaccine is ultimately intended for use in pregnant women. Approximately 216 subjects will be assigned to receive three different formulations of the investigational vaccine and 72 will be assigned to receive placebo. The approximately 216 healthy subjects assigned to receive the investigational vaccine will be further randomized (1:1:1) in a stepwise dosage -escalation manner and assigned to one of three cohorts (cohort 1: low dosage of RSV F subunit vaccine [45 \u00b5g], co hort of RSV F subunit vaccine [90 \u00b5g], and cohort 3: high dosage of RSV F subunit vaccine [135 \u00b5g]). Within each cohort subjects will be randomly allocated (1:1:1) to receive vaccine with no adjuvant, with aluminum hydroxide, or with MF59, as outlined in Table 1 . All subjects will receive two doses of a 0.5 mL intramuscular injection of the vaccine, with adjuvant (aluminum hydroxide [1 or MF59 [0.25 mL; 9.75 mg squalene and surfactants]) or without adjuvant. There will be approximately 24 subjects in each treatment group. All the remaining 72 subjects (approximately 24 subjects per cohort) will be assigned to receive placebo (saline) ( Table 1 ). The minimum interv al between the first and the second doses will be 28 days. Vaccination Plan: Eighteen (18) treatment groups (9 active treatment groups and 3 placebo [saline] groups in each cohort) will be evaluated as shown in Table 1: PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 6 of 115 Confidential Name of Sponsor Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics Protocol number: V122_01 Health authority trial number(s): EudraCT BB-IND No. TBD Table 1. Number of Subjects Randomized per Vaccine Treatment Group in Each Cohort Abbreviations: IM, intramuscular; mL, milliliter; Al(OH) 3, aluminum hydroxide. Administered at least 28 days apart. Concentration of Al(OH) 3 will be 1 mg per dose and that of MF59 will be 0.25 mL (1X, which contains 9.75 mg squalene and surfactants). Safety Measurements: Solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs) and unsolicited AEs will be collected using dia ry cards for 7 days following any dose of vaccine or placebo. Solicited local AEs include injection site pain, injection site induration, injection site swelling, and injection site erythema. Solicited systemic AEs include body temperature (oral or axillar y), chills, nausea, generalized myalgia, generalized arthralgia, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, loss of appetite, cough, rhinorrhea, and wheezing. Safety telephone calls at 14 and 21 days after each dose of vaccine or placebo will be used to collect unsolici ted AEs occurring since the last study contact, as well as any solicited AEs continuing beyond the 7 day period after vaccination. See section 3.2.5 for further details. In addition, all SAEs, new onset of chronic disease (NOCDs), and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) will be collected from the date of signed informed consent until the end of the study (approximately 393 days after the first dose of vaccine or placebo [saline]). Monitoring for AESIs (see section 6.6.1.1 and Appendix A) will be ext ended through 12 months after the second vaccination and will be accomplished by clinic visits or telephone follow -up calls as detailed in Table 2 . All AESIs will be reported in the same manner as SAEs. A tabulation of all AESIs, categorized by MedDRA preferred terms and assessed relationship to study vaccine will be performed.

All unsolicited AEs and solicited local and systemic AEs th at continue beyond 7 days after vaccination will be collected for 28 days following receipt of first and second dose of vaccine. All SAEs, non -scheduled physician visits, unsolicited medically attended AEs, unsolicited AEs leading to study withdrawal, NO CDs, and AESIs will be collected from first vaccination to study completion. All concomitant medications administered in relation to the reported AEs will be collected from first vaccination to study completion. Primary and Secondary Immunogenicity Meas urements: Four blood samples per subject will be collected for serum preparation and determination of immune responses to the RSV F subunit vaccine at Visit 1, Visit 5, Visit 9, and Visit 12 as outlined in Table 2 . Serum anti -RSV neutralizing antibody (NAb ) titers will be evaluated for all subjects by a plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNA); binding antibody to the RSV proteins F, G (subgroups G a and G b), and N will be evaluated by a microsphere -based fluorescence linked immunosorbent assay, multiple xed using Luminex\u00ae technology. See section 6.3 for further details. Safety Laboratory Parameters: To assess laboratory AEs, blood and urine samples will be collected for each subject at Screening, Visit 1, Visit 2, Visit 5, Visit 6, and Visit 9 as outlined in Table 2 to perform blood chemistry, hematology, and urine analyses for all subjects. Exploratory Measurements: The serum neutralizing antibody (NAb) and binding antibody responses against additional RSV strains and native or engineered RSV antigens at baseline and following vaccination will be performed in a subset of subjects, following evaluation of the primary and secondary immunogenicity evaluations and depending on volume of serum remaining for additional testing.

The purpose of these assays is to determine the frequency of B cells specific for RSV proteins by enzyme -linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT). Subsequently, the analysis of the RSV -specific B -cell repertoire will be performed in a subset of these subjects. See section 6.8 for further details. Number of Subjects planned: Sample size is not driven by statistical assumptions for formal hypothesis testing as previous clinical trial data are not available and clinically meaningful group differences are not established. In addition, values for a correlate of protection are not known at present stage. Nevertheless, some information from the neutralization assay for human serum was available. Hence, the number of proposed subjects will be sufficient to provide a descriptive summary of the safety and immunogenicity of the RSV F su bunit vaccine. Anticipating that about 10% of the subjects will be non -evaluable (due to being lost to follow -up, having insufficient samples, incomplete laboratory results, or protocol violations, etc.), approximately 288 subjects will be randomized to 12 different treatment groups (approximately 24 subjects in each vaccine treatment group and approximately 24 subjects in each of the placebo cohorts), in order to obtain approximately 260 evaluable healthy adult subjects.

this document should be reviewed prior to initiating the study. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of acute lo wer respiratory tract infections (ALRIs) that result in hospital visits during infancy and early childhood. In the United States, more than 60% of infants are infected by RSV during their first RSV season, and nearly all have been infected by two to three years of age ( Breese, 2010; Glezen et al., 1986 ). Approximately 2.1 million US children less than five years of age are treated for RSV disease each year: 3% as inpatients, 25% in emergency departments, and 73% in pediatric practices ( Hall et al., 2009 ). Disease burden is similar in Europe, with more than 1% of all children less than three years of age hospitalized annually and more than 7% receiving outpatient medical care ( Forster et al., 2004 ). Globally, among children less than five years of age, RSV c auses an estimated 33.8 million ALRIs each year (more than 22% of all ALRIs), resulting in 66,000 -199,000 deaths, 99% of which occur in developing countries ( Nair et al., 2010 ). In addition, RSV is a common cause of respiratory disease among the elderly, resulting in as many hospitalizations as influenza in a heavily influenza -immunized population ( Falsey et al., 2005 ). RSV spreads by respiratory droplets and close contact with infected persons or contaminated objects. In temperate climates there is an ann ual winter epidemic ( Brandt et al., 1973 ). In tropical areas seasonality is less distinct, but infection is most common during the rainy season ( Weber et al., 1998 ). Infants are at highest risk for severe RSV disease in their first six months ( Iwane et al., 2004; Hall et al., 2009 ), and hospitalization peaks at two to three months of age ( Parrott et al., 1973 ). Preterm birth and cardiopulmonary disease are risk factors for severe disease, with 33.8% of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia hos pitalized for RSV in their first year of life ( Boyce et al., 2000 ). Bronchiolitis is the classic presentation of RSV. RSV also causes pneumonia, rhinitis, and otitis media. Severe RSV infection in infancy is associated with higher rates of asthma later in childhood ( Stein et al., 1999; Wu & Hartert, 2006 ). Recommended treatment of RSV bronchiolitis consists primarily of respiratory support and hydration (Subcommittee on diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis, 2006 ). No specific anti - viral therapy is rec ommended. The neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb), Palivizumab\u00ae, directed to a single epitope of the RSV fusion glycoprotein (F), is used for prophylaxis of infants at highest risk for severe RSV disease, and although the monoclonal antibody can protect these infants, it is too expensive and impractical for universal use ( Prescott et al., 2010 ). Induction of neutralizing antibody (NAb) should be the primary goal of vaccination because the severity of RSV disease is largely determined by the extent of vir al replication ( Graham, 2011 ). Although developing a safe and PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 28 of 115 Confidential effective RSV vaccine is a global public health priority and will have a significant impact on RSV prevention, there is no licensed RSV vaccine. A history of RSV vaccine -mediated disease enhancement raises safety concerns for vaccine studies in RSV -naive infants. In a key RSV vaccine clinical trial in the late 1960s, infants and young children were immunized with a formalin -inactivated whole virion RSV preparation (FI-RSV) or an equivalent paramyxovirus control preparation (FI- PIV). Five percent of the s ubjects who were immunized with FI -PIV and then naturally infected by RSV during the next RSV season were hospitalized; 80% of those who were immunized with FI -RSV and then infected by RSV were hospitalized, and two of them died (Kim et al., 1969). FI -RSV -mediated RSV disease enhancement has been attributed to FI -RSV's failure to elicit neutralizing antibodies combined with its priming for an exaggerated, Th2 -predominant immune response to subsequent RSV infection (Bouhvalova et al., 2006 ; Graham et al., 19 93; Kalina et al., 2004 ; Connors et al., 1994 ; De Swart et al., 2002 ; Polack et al., 2002 ; The Impact -RSV Study Group, 1998 ; Shaw et al., 2013 ). Given the early age of peak RSV disease ( Iwane et al., 2004 ; Hall et al., 2009; Parrott et al., 1973 ), an RSV vaccine would ideally be administered to neonates and young infants, elicit neutralizing antibodies, and prime for an immune response to RSV infection that prevents rather than enhances RSV disease. However, it is difficult to actively immunize infants to protect them by two to three months of age because time must elapse after immunization for a neutralizing antibody response, and more than one dose of vaccine may be needed. Direct infant immunization is also challenged by the inhibitory effects of maternal antibody ( Crowe, 2001 ; Wood & Siegrist, 2011 ; Philbin & Levy, 2009 ; Shaw et al., 2013 ) and the immaturity of the neonatal immune system, which has impaired antigen -presenting cell responses, Th2 -biased cellular responses, and impaired antibody affinity maturation. Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics (NVD) has developed an investigational RSV subunit vaccine from an engineered recombinant RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein. The engineered recombinant F antigen is modified from the wild type F glycoprotei n of RSV strain A2, a laboratory group A prototype strain isolated in 1961 from an infant with bronchiolitis. The wild type RSV F glycoprotein is a homotrimer that is anchored in the viral envelope by a C -terminal transmembrane region. The RSV F protein me diates virus -cell fusion, is highly conserved among RSV isolates, and is a major target of neutralizing antibodies (Shaw et al., 2013 ). The clinical program will evaluate the feasibility of passively protecting infants by immunizing pregnant women with the RSV F subunit vaccine. The inverse correlation between maternal, cord blood, or infant serum RSV neutralizing titers and early RSV disease in infants demonstrates that maternal antibody can protect infants (Glezen et al., 1981 ; Piedra et al., 2003 ). Altho ugh a precise correlate of protection has not yet been agreed, studies of passive protection by maternal antibody or administered PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 29 of 115 Confidential immunoglobulin and studies of RSV infection of cotton rats suggest that infant serum neutralizing titers of approximately 1:200 to 1:400 ( Piedra et al., 200 3; Groothuis et al., 1993 ; Prince et al., 1985 ; Siber et al., 1994 ; Shaw et al., 2013 ). The half -life of maternal antibody in infants predicts that each doubling of titer should extend passive infant protection by approximately one month ( Ochola et al., 2009 ; Brandenburg et al., 1997 ). If maternal immunization during 24 to 32 w eeks of gestation increases antibody titers eight -fold, the median peak of RSV disease in infants would be delayed by approximately three months from its current peak at two to three months of age to a new peak at approximately five to six months of age. T his delay could significantly decrease the burden of RSV disease in infants in the first months of life and open an RSV disease -free interval during which active immunization of infants could further extend protection beyond six months of age. Because the duration of protection of an infant receiving transplacental antibody from an immunized pregnant woman is expected to be directly dependent on the woman's neutralizing titer to RSV, there is no maximum desirable neutralization titer. This is an important distinction between immunization of a subject to actively protect that subject and immunization of a pregnant woman to passively protect her infant from a disease with an extended period of vulnerability after birth. With immunization for active immunity, achievement of a threshold immune response indicates that the subject's immune system is sufficiently primed to protect against future disease, often remote future disease, and the goal is to achieve that threshold response. On the other hand, with immuniz ation for passive protection, the infant receives a finite placental transfer of antibody before birth, and that protective antibody decays to zero over time, leaving no priming of the immune system of the infant to protect against future and distant infec tions. As a consequence, the goal for passive immunization is to elicit the highest level of neutralizing antibodies in the pregnant subject that can be achieved safely, tolerably, and practically, so that a maximal neutralizing antibody titer is transferred to the infant before birth, providing the longest possible period of passive protection after birth. Given the extended vulnerability of infants to severe RSV infections, at least through two years of age, and the approximately one month half -life of passively transferred antibody ( Breese, 2010 ; Glezen et al., 1986 ; Hall et al., 2009 ; Ochola et al., 2009; Brandenburg et al., 1997 ), any achievable maternal neutralization titer is unlikely to protect throughout the complete period of vulnerability . Preclinical animal experiments with the investigational RSV F subunit vaccine have shown different effects of dosage levels, number of doses, and need for adjuvant, depending on the RSV infection history of the animal. The difference between the respons es of RSV -na\u00efve and recently RSV -infected animals complicates extrapolation of the results to immunization of adult humans, who are likely to have been more remotely infected. In RSV -na\u00efve cotton rats or mice, aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH) MF59 was requi red for high titer neutralizing responses. There was a clear dosage level -response for PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 30 of 115 Confidential both adjuvanted and unadjuvanted RSV F subunit vaccine (two intramuscular [IM] injections at a three week interval) in mice, with a plateau achieved with approximately 3.3 \u00b5g of aluminum hydroxide -adjuvanted and 10 \u00b5g Maximum of a pproximately 1:1,000 in mice and 1:7,000 in cotton rats were less than two -fold higher with aluminum hydroxide than with MF59 in both species. However, cotton rats and mice infected intranasally with RSV that were subsequently immunized once IM with 5 \u00b5g, 0.5 \u00b5g, or 0.05 \u00b5g of RSV F subunit vaccine seven weeks later (cotton rats) or eleven weeks later (mice), showed a four -fold increase (cotton rats) and 10 to 50 -fold increase (mice) in neutralizing titers after immunization - but the neutralizing titers we re minimally impacted by the RSV F subunit vaccine dosage level, by the inclusion of adjuvant (none, aluminum hydroxide, or MF59), or by a second vaccine injection given three weeks after the first. The discrepancy between the effect of dosage level in previously RSV -infected and RSV - na\u00efve rodents, the unknown (and possibly long) expected interval between natural RSV infection and immunization of adult humans, the lack of predictable scaling of dosag e- response with body size, and species -specific adjuvant effects make the animal data a poor guide to dosage level and regimen determination for testing the RSV F subunit vaccine in humans. Therefore, previous clinical trial experience with other F -contai ning, non-replicating RSV vaccines, rather than the animal data, serve as the primary guide for the initial selection of dosage levels for testing of Novartis's RSV F subunit vaccine candidate in humans. Available clinical trial results suggest that adult humans respond in a manner that is intermediate between the RSV -na\u00efve and previously RSV -infected mice and cotton rats, and require higher dosage levels than those used to immunize rodents (Glenn et al., 2013 ; Mu\u00f1oz et al, 2003 ; Falsey & Walsh, 1996 ; False y & Walsh, 1997 ; Falsey et al., 2008 ; Langley et al., 2009 ). Because the adult human population is seropositive for RSV, RSV vaccination in adults will act as a booster. Boosting immunity in RSV -seropositive individuals may be challenging and may require use of adjuvant. Aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH) 3] and aluminum phosphate salts are the most commonly used adjuvant in licensed vaccines worldwide and they have a well -established safety profile, including in pregnant women (Baylor et al., 2002 ; Silveira et al., 1995 ; Blencowe et al., 2010 ; Murphy et al., 2008 ; ACIP, 2011 ; Mast et al., 2005 ; Levy & Koren, 1991 ; Tsai et al., 2010 ; Vecchi et al., 2012 ). MF59 is citrate. MF59 is used in subunit influenza vaccines that are licensed in European and other countries (not including the United States), such as Fluad\u00ae (seasonal), Aflunov\u00ae (H5N1 (cell culture -produced H1N1 pandemic). More than 100 million doses of MF59 - adjuvanted influenza vaccines have been distributed in licensed products. Although MF59 -adjuvanted vaccines are somewhat more reactogenic than equivalent non - adjuvanted vaccines, clinical trials and post -marketing surveillance demonstrate MF59's PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 31 of 115 Confidential good safety and tolerability profile ( O'Hagan 2007; 2013 ; Pellegrini et al., 2009 ; Tsai et al., 2010 ; Schultze et al., 2008 ; Black et al., 2010 ). An estimate of >90,000 pregnant women were vaccinated with Focetria during the 2009 pandemic. Preliminary data from observational studies, spontaneously reported events, and ongoing post -market ing studies (a pregnancy registry and a prospective interventional study) have provided no evidence of direct or indirect harmful effects to mother or fetus from the use of MF59 -adjuvanted vaccines during pregnancy ( Banzhoff et al., 2011 ; Parretta et al., 2011 ; Zuccotti et al., 2010 ; Huang et al., 2011 ). The mechanism of action of adjuvants is not completely understood, but both aluminum hydroxide and MF59 are thought to increase local cytokines and chemokines and increase cell recruitment (including eosinophils for aluminum hydroxide, neutrophils for M F59, and monocytes and macrophages for both) (Awate et al., 2013 ). Aluminum hydroxide is also proposed to increase antigen presentation, while MF59 increases antigen uptake, increases antigen -loaded neutrophils and monocytes, and activates muscle cells ( Awate et al., 2013 ). In total, approximately 150 million doses of MF59 -adjuvanted vaccines have been distributed ( O'Hagan et al., 2013 ). No safety concerns have been observed related to MF59 ( O'Hagan et al., 2013 ). Similarly, hundreds of millions of doses of aluminum -containing adjuvants have been administered without any major safety findings ( Lamprecht et al., 2009 ). Recently, Novavax (Rockville, MD) performed a Phase 1 randomized, observer -blinded, placebo -controlled clinical trial with a similar recombin ant RSV F subunit vaccine to evaluate its safety and immunogenicity in healthy adults ( Glenn et al., 2013 ). The results of the Phase 1 clinical trial showed that 30 \u00b5g and 60 \u00b5g (with or without aluminum phosphate) induced a two -fold increase in neutralizi ng titers after two IM two-fold titers was negatively correlated with baseline neutralizing titers. The small magnitude of the increase of neutralizing titers and large range of baseline neutralizing titers led to v ariable increases in neutralizing titers with dosage level or use of adjuvant. Dosage level -responses for RSV F binding antibodies (including those that compete with Palivizumab\u00ae) covered a broader range ( Glenn et al., 2013 ). There was no plateau in bindin g antibody titers between the two highest dosage levels tested, 30 and 60 \u00b5g, but there were increases in binding titers with aluminum phosphate adjuvant and a modest increase with a second injection (a maximum 1.6 -fold increase at 5 \u00b5g or 15 \u00b5g with alumi num phosphate and a smaller increase at higher dosage levels) ( Glenn et al., 2013 ). A subsequent clinical trial is currently being performed in women of child bearing age with 60 and 90 \u00b5g of their RSV F subunit vaccine candidate. Although other trials in the literature do not provide as clearly relevant information ( Mu\u00f1oz et al, 2003 ; Falsey & Walsh, 1996 ; Falsey & Walsh, 1997 ; Falsey et al., 2008 ; Langley et al., 2009 ; Tristram et al., 1993 ; Belshe et al., 1993 ; Paradiso et al., 1994 ; Piedra et al., 2003 ), their results are broadly consistent with those of the Novavax Phase 1 clinical trial ( Glenn et al., 2013 ), which closely followed the intended immunization regimen for the NVD investigational RSV F subunit vaccine PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 32 of 115 Confidential candidate. In previous clinical trials of former (or still current) non -replicating RSV F subunit vaccine candidates, including trials conducted in RSV seropositive infants, typical dosage levels of RSV antigens tested IM have been in the range of 5 to 100 \u00b5g per dose (Glenn et al., 2013 ; Mu\u00f1oz et al, 2003 ; Falsey & Walsh, 1996 ; Falsey & Walsh, 1997 ; Falsey et al., 2008 ; Langley et al., 2009 ; Tristram et al., 1993 ; Belshe et al., 1993 ; Paradiso et al., 1994 ; Piedra et al., 2003 ). To provide the longest per iod of protection from RSV disease in infants, the goal is to maximize neutralizing antibody titers in pregnant women through immunization. In the current study, we will test one dosage of the investigational RSV F subunit vaccine that is presumed to be be low the dosage -response plateau (to establish that a maximal neutralizing antibody response cannot be achieved with a low dosage) and two higher dosages (to either establish the dosage -response plateau or indicate that higher dosages are needed in a subseq uent study to reach the plateau). Therefore, for the current study, two doses (administered IM at least 28 days apart) of three dosage levels of the investigational RSV F subunit vaccine will be tested in healthy adults: 45 \u00b5g, 90 \u00b5g, and 135 \u00b5g. The two -dose regimen was selected because clinical data with a similar vaccine candidate ( Glenn et al., 2013 ) have shown an increase in titers following the second dose. Based on the previous clinical experience with similar vaccine candidates, the lowest dosage le vel (45 \u00b5g) is not anticipated to be on the dosage -response plateau. In a non - GLP preclinical toxicology study in rabbits, two simultaneous injections of 135 \u00b5g of the RSV F subunit vaccine candidate were well -tolerated, and the preclinical safety and tolerability of a 135 \u00b5g dosage will be confirmed in the GLP preclinical toxicology study before this Phase 1 study starts. Based on these constraints, the two upper dosages, 90 \u00b5g and 135 \u00b5g, have been selected to maximize the chances that a dosage -response plateau will be established in this study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of the investigational RSV F subunit vaccine administered IM. In this current Phase 1, first - in- human study, the three differen t antigen amounts that have been selected will be evaluated in a stepwise manner in three different cohorts (cohort 1: low dosage of RSV F subunit vaccine [45 \u00b5g], cohort 2: middle dosage of RSV F subunit vaccine [90 \u00b5g], and cohort 3: high dosage of RSV F subunit vaccine [135 \u00b5g]). In addition, the effect of an adjuvant, either aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH) 3] or MF59, and antibody kinetics post - vaccination at different time points will be evaluated as compared to unadjuvanted RSV F subunit vaccine at the sam e dosage levels. The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and applicable regulatory requirement(s).

In total, approximately 288 healthy non - pregnant female and male adults (18 to 45 years of age) will be enrolled in the st udy in the ratio of 3:1. There is a higher ratio of female to male subjects because the RSV F subunit vaccine is ultimately intended for use in pregnant women. Men are still being included in this study because the vaccine may also be tested in the future in elderly subjects. Approximately 216 healthy subjects will be randomized to receive the investigational vaccine. Subjects will be enrolled (1:1:1) in a stepwise dosage -escalation manner in to one of three cohorts (cohort 1: low dosage of RSV F subunit v accine [45 \u00b5g], cohort of RSV F subunit vaccine [90 \u00b5g], and cohort 3: high dosage of RSV F subunit vaccine [135 \u00b5g]). Cohort 1 will be enrolled first, followed by cohort 2, and finally cohort 3.Within each cohort subjects will be randomly allocated (1:1:1) to receive vaccine with no adjuvant, with aluminum hydroxide, or with MF59, as outlined in Table 1. All subjects will receive two doses of a 0.5 mL intramuscular injection of the vaccine, with adjuvant (aluminum hydroxide [1 or MF59 [0.25 mL; 9.75 mg squalene and surfactants]) or without adjuvant. There will be approximately 24 subjects in each treatment group. All the remaining 72 subjects will be assigned to receive placebo (saline) (approximately 24 subjects per cohort) ( Table 1 ). The minimum interval between doses will be 28 days. The study duration for a given subject will be approximately 13 months. An Interim Analysis will be performed on the immunogenicity and safety data collected from all subjects at Visit 1 (baseline), Visi t 5 (28 days after the first dose), and Visit 9 (28 days after the second dose). Further details regarding the interim analysis are contained in section 7.5 . Vaccination Plan: Eighteen (18) treatment groups (9 active treatment groups and 3 placebo [saline ] groups in each cohort) will be evaluated as shown in Table 1: PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 36 of 115 Confidential Table 3.1-1: Number of Subjects Randomized per Vaccine Treatment Group in Each Cohort Cohort Dosage Route of Administration Regimen: Two Doses No Adjuvant Al(OH)3 MF59 1 45 \u00b5g IM (0.5 mL) 24 24 24 Placebo (saline) IM (0.5 mL) 8 8 8 2 90 \u00b5g IM (0.5 mL) 24 24 24 Placebo (saline) IM (0.5 mL) 8 8 8 3 135 \u00b5g IM (0.5 mL) 24 24 24 Placebo (saline) IM (0.5 mL) 8 8 8 Abbreviations: IM, intramuscular; mL, milliliter; Al(OH) 3, aluminum hydroxide.

Consent must be given with free will of choice, and without undue inducement. The individual must have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the nature of the proposed research, the anticipated risks and potential benefits, and the requirements of the research to be able to make an informed decision. Informed consent following local IRB/EC guidance must be obtained before conducting any study -specific procedure (i.e., all of the procedures described in the protocol). The process of obtaining informed consent should be documented in the subject source documents in addition to maintaining a copy of the signed and dated informed consent. If a subject is unable to read, an impartial witness should be present during the entire informed consent discussion. An impartial witness is defined as a person who is independent from trial conduct, who cannot be unfairly influenced by those involved with PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 37 of 115 Confidential the trial, who attends the informed consent process if the subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative cannot read, and who reads the informed consent form and any other written information supplied to the subject. After the written informed consent form and any other written information to be provided to subjects, is read and explained to the subject and after the subject has verbally consented to the subject's participation in the trial and, if capable of doing so, has signed and personally dated the informed consent form, the witness should sign and personally date the consent form. By signing the consent form, the witness attests that the information in the consent form and any other written information was accurately explained to, and app arently understood by, the subject and that informed consent was freely given by the subject. 3.2.2 Screening Procedures After an individual has consented to participate in the study and informed consent/assent is signed, that individual will be given a unique screening number which is documented in the Screening & Enrollment Log. Screening procedures will include the following: Medical history, including but not limited to: - Prior vaccinations - Concomitant medications - Previous and ongoing illnesses or injuries Physical examination, including but not limited to: - Vital signs - Assessment of general appearance - Examination of head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat (HEENT) - Examination of skin - Auscultation of heart and lungs - Palpation of abdomen - Examination of extremities Safety laboratory blood draw Urinalysis Pregnancy test (for female subjects) See section 3.5.3 , section 6.2 , and Table 2 for more information.

The reason for screen failure must be documented in the Screening & Enrollment Log. If the individual is determined to be eligible f or the study, he/she should be enrolled into the study as described in section 3.2.3 . 3.2.3 Enrollment After an individual is determined to be eligible for study participation, the subject will be enrolled using a computerized randomization system that automat ically assigns a unique Subject ID. The Subject ID consists of a 7 digit number resulting from the combination of the site number and the subject's order of randomization at the site. Access to the system can be obtained by the site staff either via web or telephone (as back up). Enrollment of all three cohorts will not occur simultaneously. Instead, subjects will be enrolled in to each cohort in a step -wise manner based on the dosage -escalation design. The first 12 subjects will be enrolled in cohort 1, a safety review of cohort 1 data through Visit 2 will be performed by the DMC, and then the remaining subjects in cohort 1 will be enrolled. After a safety review of cohort 1 data through Visit 9 is performed by the DMC, the first 12 subjects will be enroll ed in cohort 2. After the safety review of cohort 2 data through Visit 2 is completed the remainder of cohort 2 subjects will be enrolled. Once safety review of cohort 2 data through Visit 9 has been completed by the DMC, the first 12 subjects of cohort 3 will be enrolled. Finally, cohort 3 enrollment will be completed after DMC review of cohort 3 safety data through Visit 2. 3.2.4 Randomization Subjects will be randomly assigned to study groups in a pre -specified ratio as described in section 3.1 . The computeri zed randomization system will allocate the subject to one of the study groups and assign a Pack Number corresponding to the pack containing the treatment to be administered to the subject according to the randomization list. The list of randomization assig nments will be produced by the service provider and approved by NVD Biostatistics and Clinical Data Management department (BCDM) according to applicable NVD SOP. If for any reason, after signing the informed consent form (ICF), the subject (who has passed screening) fails to be randomized, the reason for not being randomized should be recorded on source documents as specified in the source data agreement. The information on these subjects, who are randomization failures, should be kept distinct in the sour ce documentation from screen failures, which are described in section 3.2.2 .

Pregnancy testing: all women of child -bearing potential will be tested; refer to section 3.5.2 for guidance regarding the procedure 3.2.5.2 Vaccination Procedures Subjects will receive two (2) doses of vaccine according to their assigned treatment in a blinded fashion. Vaccination will be performed at Visit 1 and Visit 5. The minimum interval between vaccinations will be 28 days. After confirming eligibility and enrolling subject into the study at Visit 1, perform vaccination of the subject according to the assigned study vaccine and according to the procedures described in section 5.3 and observing the blinding procedures describe d in section 3.3 . At Visit 5, confirm that the subject does not meet any criteria for delaying or cancelling additional study vaccinations, as described in section 4.3 and section 4.4 of the protocol. 3.2.5.3 Post-vaccination Procedures The following post -vaccin ation procedures will be performed at Visit 1 and Visit 5. 1. Subjects will be provided with a diary card at Visit 1 and Visit 5. 2. Careful training of the subject on how to measure local reactions and body temperature, how to complete and how often to complet e the diary card is crucial. Training should be directed at the individual(s) who will perform the measurements of reactions and those who will enter the information into the diary card. This individual can be someone other than the subject, but if a perso n other than the subject enters information into the diary card, this person's identity must be documented in the study file and this person must receive training on the diary card. Training of the subject on how to measure an injection site reaction shoul d be performed while the subject is under observation after vaccination. 3. The subject must understand that timely completion of the diary card on a daily basis is a critical component to study participation. The subject should also be instructed to write clearly and to complete the diary card in pen. Any corrections to the diary card that are performed by the person completing the diary card should include a single PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 41 of 115 Confidential strikethrough line with a brief explanation for any change. No changes can be made to the diary card when it is returned to the clinic. 4. Starting on the day of vaccination, the subject will check in the evening for specific types of reactions at the injection site (solicited local adverse events), an y specific generalized symptoms (solicited systemic adverse events), body temperature (taken preferably orally), any other symptoms or change in the subject's health status, and any medications taken (excluding vitamins and minerals). These solicited adver se events and body temperature will be recorded in the \"six hour\" location on the diary card. 5. Body temperature measurement is to be performed using the thermometer provided by the site. If the subject feels unusually hot or cold during the day, the subject should check body temperature. If the subject has a fever, the highest body temperature observed that day should be recorded on the diary card. The measurement of solicited local adverse events is to be performed using the ruler provided by the site. The collection of body temperature, solicited local adverse events, and solicited systemic adverse events will continue for a total of 7 days on the diary card. The collection of unsolicited adverse events and medications will continue for 7 days on the diary card, (or until the subject returns for the next clinic visit). 6. After vaccination, the subject will be observed for at least 30 minutes including observation for unsolicited adverse events, solicited adverse events, and body temperature measur ement. The site staff should take the opportunity to remind the subject how to measure solicited reactions and body temperature as part of this observation period. Record all safety data collected in the subject's source documents. 7. The site should schedule the next study activity (reminder call) with the subject. 8. The subject will receive a written reminder of the next planned study activity. The subject will be reminded to complete the diary card daily and to contact the site if there are any questions and to contact the site immediately (or as soon as the subject is medically stable) if the subject has a medical condition that leads to a hospitalization or an emergency room visit. 3.2.5.4 Reminder Telephone Calls 1. Reminder calls will be pe rformed 2 and 4 days after each vaccination. 2. The purpose of this call is to remind the subject about completion of the diary card. It is a conversation that follows the reminder telephone call script provided to the site, and it is not intended to be a cal l for collection of safety data. If the subject wishes to describe safety information, this information should only be collected by a trained PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 42 of 115 Confidential healthcare professional at the site, and the safety data described must be written down on source documents.

All AEs, SAEs, NOCDs, or AESIs will be recorded on source documents. All medications taken or vaccines received will also be recorded on the source documents. b. A symptom -directed physical exam w ill be performed (see section 6.2). c. Blood for serology will be drawn (see section 3.5.1 ). d. For subjects in cohort 3 who sign an additional Informed Consent for exploratory immunology assays (approximately 40 subjects in total, 10 from each treatment group), additional blood will be collected (see section 3.5.4 ). e. The site should schedule the next study activity (clinic visit) with the subject. f. The subject will receive a written reminder of the next planned study activity. The subject will be reminded to conta ct the site if there are any questions and to contact the site immediately (or as soon as the subject is medically stable) if the subject has a medical condition that leads to a hospitalization or an emergency room visit. 3.2.5.6 Safety Calls Safety telephone calls will be performed for Visits 3, 4, 7, and 8 (14 and 21 days after each dose). Additional safety telephone calls will be performed for Visits 14 and 15 (9 and 12 months after the first dose). 1. Safety telephone calls are calls made to the subject by a trained healthcare provider. These calls will follow a script which will facilitate the collection of relevant safety information. The subject will be interviewed according to the script, and information relating to unsolicited adverse eve nts, including serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events of special interest (AESIs), new onset of chronic disease, and AEs leading to study or vaccine withdrawal, and concomitant medications or vaccinations associated with those events. All safety information described by the subject must be written down in a designated location within the source documents and not written on the script used for the telephone call. 2. The site should schedule the next study activity (clinic visit, reminder call, or safety call) with the subject. 3. The subject will be reminded to contact the site if there are any questions and to contact the site imme diately (or as soon as the subject is medically stable) if the subject has a medical condition that leads to a hospitalization or an emergency room visit.

The termination visit will occur at Visit 16 (12 months after the second dose). For visit procedures to be performed for a subject whose planned study participat ion ends prematurely, please see section 3.8. 2. During the phone call, the following procedures will be performed: a. The subject will be interviewed to determine if any unsolicited adverse events occurred and if any concomitant medications or vaccines were taken/received in the time since the last clinic visit. b. The healthcare professional reviewing these data will discuss the symptoms (if any) reported by the subject and will determine if any additional diagnoses and/or adverse events are present. c. All AEs, S AEs, NOCDs, or AESIs will be recorded on source documents. d. All medications taken or vaccines received will be recorded on the source documents. 3. After thanking the subject for study participation, the site will review the plan of when information relating to the subject's participation in the study may be available (e.g., study results, treatment assignments). It will also be discussed how information relating to the subject's partici pation in the study will be shared with the subject's healthcare provider, if the subject chooses to share this information. The site will complete the termination CRF page and this will mark the completion of the subject's participation in the study. 3.3 Blinding Procedures This is an observer -blind study. The investigator, subjects, monitors, site personnel, and laboratory staff will be blinded to the vaccine administered, with the following exceptions: An unblinded designee (i.e., unblinded pharmacist or equivalent) will be assigned to administer the vaccine to all subjects. If deemed necessary, a second unblinded designee may be allowed to assist with vaccine preparation. The designee(s) will have no other study functions than vaccine management, docum entation, accountability, PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 46 of 115 Confidential and administration. They will not be involved in subject evaluations. They will not reveal the vaccine treatment assignment to either the subject or the site personnel involved in the conduct of the study, unless this information is necessary in the case of an emergency. The vaccine treatment assignment will be concealed to the extent possible by having the unblinded designee(s) (i.e., unblinded pharmacist) prepare the vaccine out of view of the subject or other site personnel. Each vaccine treatment group will receive a single 0.5 mL dose at each vaccination visit. In case the color or appearance of different dosages of the vaccine (or the placebo) differ, the subject will be shielded from view of the syringe and injected arm. A Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC) will perform a review of safety data after Visit 2 (seven days after the first dose) has been completed by the first 12 subjects in each cohort, and after Visit 9 (28 days after the second dose) has been completed for all subjects in each cohort. Deta ils of the DMC review of safety data and stopping guidelines can be found in the DMC Charter. An interim analysis of immunogenicity and safety data will be performed after results of serology assays for all samples through Visit 9 (28 days after the secon d dose) from all 3 cohorts are available. The analysis will include serology results from all subjects at Visits 1, 5, and 9. This interim analysis will be used to evaluate the optimal dosage and/or adjuvant for use in future clinical trials. An unblinded statistician from NVD will perform the interim analysis; results of the interim analysis will be confirmed by the DMC. Interim safety assessments will be performed by the DMC according to the DMC charter. The DMC will determine whether any safety issues ex it. An unblinded statistician from NVD may assist with the evaluations. In the event a safety issue arises, the cluster physician and NVD pharmacovigilance department will be informed. Note: Emergency unblinding should only be undertaken when it is essent ial to protect an individual subject's safety. There are limited circumstances in a vaccine study where unblinding would change the course of medical treatment or care of a subject. For an emergency unblinding, the investigator will retrieve the subject's assigned vaccine from the computerized randomization system either via web or phone (as backup). Details of the unblinding procedures will be described in the system's Site User manual.

The use of any written or verbal infor mation identifying the subject such as name, initials, photos or testimonials, requires separate and appropriate documented consent from each subject. Diary cards will be the only source document allowed for solicited systemic and local adverse events (including body temperature measurements). The following additional rules apply to documentation of safety information collected by diary card: 1. No correct ions or additions to the diary card will be allowed after it is delivered to the site. 2. Any blank or illegible fields on the diary card must be described as missing in the CRF. 3. The site must enter all readable entries in the diary card into the CRF, includi ng those values that may be biologically implausible (e.g. body temperature: 400\u00b0C). 4. Any illegible or implausible data should be reviewed with the subject to determine if an underlying solicited or unsolicited adverse event is described. For example, if th e subject with a body temperature of 400\u00b0C describes that the body temperature was actually 40\u00b0C on the day in which body temperature: 400\u00b0C was written into the diary card, this fever of 40\u00b0C should be described in the study file and reported as an unsoli cited adverse event in the adverse event CRF . 5. Any newly described safety information (including a solicited reaction) must NOT be written into the diary card and must be described in the study file as a verbally reported event. Any adverse reaction reporte d in this fashion must be described as an unsolicited reaction and therefore entered on the adverse event CRF. 3.4.2 Electronic Case Report Forms Electronic CRFs will be used in this study. Data will be entered into the database from the paper source documents , diaries, or the VSAE form. Paper CRFs will be used in this study for pregnancy and pregnancy follow -up CRFs. All data will be recorded by the investigator and/or the investigator's dedicated site staff. See section 9.1 for more details.

The blood volume drawn for serology will not exceed 15 mL at each time point in order to provide the necessary serum volume (approximately half of the blood draw volume) for the serology assays. Additional blood samples may be drawn at these time points for safety labs and additional immunology assays. Please refer to the Laboratory Manual in the In vestigator Site File for instructions on drawing and processing blood samples, including the minimum volume of blood required and what to do in the case of failed attempts at drawing blood. Please see section 6.3 for details on the serology assays and anal ysis of serology data. Samples will be retained in accordance with regulatory guidance for retention of essential study documents as described in section 10 . 3.5.2 Pregnancy Testing A urine pregnancy test will be performed at Screening, Visit 1, and Visit 5, at the study site prior to vaccination for all female subjects of childbearing potential (see section 4.2 ). Subjects must agree in the informed consent to use an appropriate metho d of birth control through 3 weeks after the last study vaccination at Visit 5 (i.e., until the Visit 8 safety call). Please refer to the instructions included with the test kits when performing urine pregnancy tests. Any subject with a positive urine preg nancy test at screening or Visit 1 will be excluded from the study. Any subject with a positive urine pregnancy test prior to receipt of the second vaccination at Visit 5 will not be vaccinated, and must be followed for safety and pregnancy outcomes. Resul ts of pregnancy testing must be recorded in the source documents. 3.5.3 Safety Laboratory Assessments A minimum of approximately 8 mL sample of blood will be drawn from all subjects at Screening, Visit 1 before vaccination, Visit 2, Visit 5 before vaccination, Visit 6, and Visit 9 for safety labs. The blood volume drawn for safety labs will not exceed 10 mL at each time point. Additional blood samples may be drawn at these time points for serology and immunology assays. Please refer to the Laboratory Manual in the Investigator Site File for instructions on drawing blood and shipping samples to the safety laboratory, including the minimum volume of blood required and what to do in the case of failed attempts at drawing blood.

Safety laboratory assessments from urine will include (but may not be limited to): Protein Glucose Presence of red blood cells The investigator MUST asse ss all safety laboratory results. If a laboratory result is outside the normal range based on the institution's normal values or CBER guidance (see Appendix D , E, and F), it must be classified as clinically significant or not. If the laboratory result is determined to be clinically significant it must be reported in the subject's medical history (in the case of screening and baseline samples tested prior to vaccination) or as an adverse event. 3.5.4 Cell Mediated Immunity Assessments Cell mediated immunity assays will be performed in approximately the first 10 subjects of each treatment group (no adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide, MF59, or placebo) enrolled in cohort 3 who sign an additional informed consent for the additional blood draws needed to perform these assays. Approximately 40 subjects total will be included in these assays. Blood samples from subjects in cohort 3 will be tested because these subjects will receive the hig hest dosage of vaccine (excluding placebo recipients) and are most likely to develop an immune response. Approximately 50 mL of blood will be drawn from subjects at Visit 1 before vaccination, Visit 2, Visit 5 before vaccination, and Visit 12. The blood volume drawn for cell mediated immunity assays will not exceed 50 mL at each time point in order to provide the necessary blood volume to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for the cell mediated immunity assays. Additional blood samples may be drawn at these time points for safety labs and serology assays.

Samples will be retained in accordance with regulatory guidance for retention of essential study documents as described in section 10 . 3.5.5 Culture/PCR/Genotyping Assessments Not applicable. 3.6 Stopping/Pausing Guidelines Stopping/pausing guidelines are predefined criteria that halt the conduct of a study (either a vaccine group or the entire study). These guidelines are used to ensure the safety of study subjects. The following criteria, based on FDA guidance and with grad ing scales from the CBER Guidance for Industry \"Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive vaccine Clinical Trials\", will be used for this study: 1. If one or more subjects experience a Grade 4 AE (see Appendix D , E, and F), vital sign or laboratory abnormality that cannot be clearly attributed to another cause, vaccination will be suspended until a full safety review is performed. 2. If six or more subjects experience a Grade 3 AE (see Appendix D , E, and F), vital sign or laboratory abnormality, dosage escalation will be suspended for that vaccine until a full safety review is performed. 3. The study will be halted (no new enrollments and no further investigational product administered until a full safety revi ew and consultation with the health authorities completed) if one of the following occurs a. One subject experiences a serious adverse event (SAE) assessed as possibly or probably related to investigational product or, b. There is a subject death assessed as pos sibly or probably related to the investigational product. If any of the halting rules are met, vaccination of subjects will be suspended until after full review of safety data by the DMC and health authorities. The investigator must inform the sponsor and the EC/IRB if any of the halting rules are met. The sponsor then must inform the DMC and health authorities. For further information on the DMC please see section 6.9 and the DMC Charter.

If the clinical study is prematurely terminated, the investigator must promptly inform the study subjects and must assure appropri ate therapy and follow -up for the subjects. All procedures and requirements pertaining to the archiving of the documents must be followed. All other study materials (such as study vaccines) must be returned to the sponsor. 3.7 Premature Withdrawal and Early S tudy Termination A subject may discontinue study participation at any time prior to the last planned study visit. This is referred to as premature withdrawal from the study (see below for a description of withdrawal from study vaccine for subjects which r efers to those subjects who do not receive additional vaccine doses but continue in the study for safety follow -up and/or other procedures). The reasons for premature withdrawal from the study include: Adverse event Death Withdrawal of consent Lost to follow -up Administrative reason Protocol deviation Other NOTE: Before entering any alternate category as the reason for the subject's discontinuation from the study, the investigator should make every effort to investigate whether or not safety concerns (adverse event or death) may have been related to the subje ct's discontinuation from the study. If a safety concern has been associated with the subject's discontinuation, this must be described on the Termination CRF page, even if it is not the primary reason for the subject's discontinuation. For any subject w ithdrawing from study participation prior to the planned Termination visit, it is important to determine if an AE was associated with the reason for discontinuing the study. This AE must be identified on the AE CRF page by indicating \"Withdrawn from study due to AE\". For any subject withdrawn from study participation due to death, this should be noted on the Termination CRF page and the associated SAE that led to the death must be reported. PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 53 of 115 Confidential The subject can withdraw consent for participation in the study at any time without penalty or loss of benefit to which the subject is otherwise entitled. Reason for early termination should be deeme d as \"withdrawal of consent\" if the subject withdraws from participation due to a non -medical reason (i.e., reason other than AE). If the subject intends to withdraw consent from the study, the investigator should clarify if the subject will withdraw completely from the study or if the subject will continue study participation for safety or a subset of other study procedures. If complete withdrawal from the study by the subject is specified, no further study interventions will be performed with the subject. The date of termination is the date of the last contact (clinic visit or telephone) in which the subject's health status was assessed or, in cases where the subject does not agree to any further safety follow -up; it is the date consent is withdrawn. For s ubjects who fail to show up for scheduled visits (clinic or telephone contacts), study staff are encouraged to make at least three documented attempts to contact the subject by telephone and at least one documented written attempt to contact the subject an d encourage the completion of study termination procedures. These efforts to contact the subject should be recorded in the source documents. The termination date for the subject to be captured on the Termination CRF page is the date of the last successful visit (clinic or telephone) with the subject. For subjects who are withdrawn from the study due to sponsor decision (e.g., meeting pre-specified withdrawal criteria or termination of study by the sponsor), this reason should be noted in the Termination CR F page and any ongoing AEs at the time of study withdrawal must be followed until resolution/stabilization. In general, subjects associated with protocol deviations may remain in the study unless continuation in the study jeopardizes the subject's health, safety, or rights. For subjects who are withdrawn from the study due to receipt of an excluded medication/vaccination or due to significant protocol non -compliance, this reason should be noted in the Termination CRF page. Any ongoing AEs at the time of st udy withdrawal must be followed until resolution/stabilization. See below for greater detail. If a subject is withdrawn prematurely from the study for a reason other than those outlined above, this reason must be documented in the Termination CRF page. In studies that involve more than 1 consecutive dose of study vaccine, a separate event is \"withdrawal of study vaccination \". This event may occur if subjects are expected to receive more than 1 consecutive dose of vaccine as part of study participation. The act of withholding additional study vaccinations is referred to as withdrawal of study vaccination. Subjects may be withdrawn from study vaccination for several reasons PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 54 of 115 Confidential including but not limited to: AE related to earlier vaccinations, failure to meet criteria for revaccination (see section 4.4 ), or pregnancy. Subjects who are withdrawn from study vaccination should be encouraged to continue in the study for safety follow -up and other procedures as appropriate until the scheduled termination visit. If the subject is withdrawn from study vaccination(s) due to adv erse event, this event must be linked to the withdrawal from vaccination on the AE CRF page. The sponsor or the investigator (following consultation with the sponsor) has the right to discontinue this study at any time. If the clinical study is prematurel y terminated, the investigator is to promptly inform the study subjects and local EC/IRB and should assure appropriate therapy and follow up for the subjects. All procedures and requirements pertaining to the archiving of study documents should be followed . All other study materials (such as vaccines) must be returned to the sponsor. Any subject who, despite the requirement for adequate contraception, becomes pregnant during the trial will not receive further vaccination but should be encouraged to continu e participation in the study. The site should complete a Pregnancy Report CRF (initial report) as soon as possible (see section 6.6.4 further details). If the subject withdraws from the study for any of the categories listed above except death, the site wi ll obtain permission from the subject to continue to remain in contact with her until the outcome of the pregnancy is known, even if the outcome is not known until after the subject reaches the end of the routine study period. Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. When a subject is withdrawn or withdraws from the study, the procedures described in section 3.8 Early Termination Visit should be completed if possible. 3.8 Early Termination Visit When a subject is withdrawn or withdraws from the study, the i nvestigator will notify the sponsor and, when possible, will perform the procedures listed below: Collect the diary card (if not already collected). Review the subject's solicited and unsolicited safety data. Perform review of systems (see section 3.2.5 for explanation) and review of concomitant medications/vaccinations since last visit. Collect vital sign measurements, including respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse rate, and temperature (oral).

All vaccines associated with this study must be checked for expiration date prior to use. Expired vaccines must not be administered to subjects. 5.1 Study Vaccine(s) The term 'study vaccine' refers to those vaccine s provided by the Sponsor, which will be evaluated as part of the study objectives. The study vaccines specific to this study are described below. Three dosage levels of the RSV F subunit vaccine will be tested in this study, including formulations with a nd without adjuvant (see Table 5.1 ). Subjects will be randomized into three different cohorts, which will be assigned to receive one of the following dosage levels: 1. Cohort 1: 45 \u00b5g 2. Cohort 2: 90 \u00b5g 3. Cohort 3: 135 \u00b5g Within each cohort subjects will be further randomized to receive the RSV F subunit vaccine without adjuvant, with 1 mg aluminum hydroxide, or with MF59 (which contains 9.75 mg squalene and surfactants in 0.25 mL). Additionally, approximately 24 subjects in each cohort will be randomized to receive placebo (saline). Details of vaccine composition in each cohort are summarized in Table 5.1 .

No non -study vaccines are planned for this trial. Non -study vaccines which are given to subjects during the trial will be recorded in the Prior and Concomitant Medications/Blood Products eCRF. 5.3 Vaccines Preparation and Administration Detailed descriptions for vaccine handling and preparation will be placed in the Investigator Site File and t he investigator must review these materials prior to study start. The investigator or designee will be responsible for oversight of the administration of vaccine to subjects enrolled in the study according to the procedures stipulated in this study protocol. All vaccines will be administered only by unblinded personnel w ho are qualified to perform that function under applicable local laws and regulations for the specific study site.

The lyophilized product is reconstituted with (a) sterile 0.9% NaCl to generate the (b) aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH) 3] to generate the RSV F subunit vaccine in Al(OH) 3, or (c) sterile saline 0.9% NaCl and adjuvant MF59 to generate the RSV F subunit vaccine formulated with MF59. In addition, the vaccine will need to be reconstituted in saline and diluted to the proper dosage for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, and mixed with adjuvant as needed for each treatment group (for example, diluted and mixed with aluminum hydroxide for vaccine group E in Table 5.1 ), while also producing the correct final volume of 0.5 mL. Complete reconstituti on and mixing instructions can be found in the Investigator Site File. The vaccine will be injected intramuscularly as a 0.5 mL dose using a standard syringe. A new syringe will be used for each subject. PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN ADMINISTERING STUDY V ACCINE: Prior to vaccination, subjects must be determined to be eligible for study vaccination and it must be clinically appropriate in the judgment of the investigator to vaccinate. Eligibility for vaccination prior to first study vaccine administration is determined by evaluating the entry criteria outlined in protocol section 4.1 through 4.2. Eligibility for subsequent study vaccination is determined by following the criteria outlined in sections 4.3 and 4.4. Study vaccines should not be administered to individuals with known hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccines. Standard immunization practices are to be observed and care should be taken to administer the injection in tramuscularly. Before administering vaccine, the vaccination site is to be disinfected with a skin disinfectant (e.g., 70% alcohol). Allow the skin to dry. DO NOT inject intravascularly . As with all injectable vaccines, trained medical personnel and appro priate medical treatment should be readily available in case of anaphylactic reactions following vaccine administration. For example, epinephrine 1:1000, diphenhydramine, and/or other medications for treating anaphylaxis should be available. 5.4 Prior and Con comitant Medications and Vaccines All medications, vaccines and blood products taken or received by the subject within 28 days prior to the start of the study are to be recorded on the Prior and Concomitant Medications/Blood Products eCRF. The use of anti pyretics and/or analgesic medications within 24 hours prior to vaccination must be identified and the reason for their use PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 63 of 115 Confidential (prophylaxis versus treatment) must be described in the source documents and/or diary card and Concomitant Medications eCRF. Medications taken for prophylaxis are those intended to prevent the onset of symptoms. Medications taken for treatment are intende d to reduce or eliminate the presence of symptoms that are present. In addition, the following are considered prior medications for this protocol: all medication/vaccines described in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this protocol including those t hat may adversely affect the immune system. Concomitant medications include all medications (including vaccines) taken by/administered to the subject at and after enrollment and must be documented on the Concomitant Medications/Blood Products eCRF. When recording concomitant medications/vaccines, they should be checked against the study entry and continuation criteria in sections 4.1 through 4.4 to ensure that the subject should be enrolled/continue in the study. 5.5 Vaccine Supply, Labeling, Storage, and Tracking The sponsor will ensure the following: supply the study vaccine appropriate labeling of all study vaccines provided that complies with the legal requirements of each country where the study is to be performed The investigator must ensure the following: acknowledge receipt of the study vaccines by a designated staff member at the site, including confirmation that the vaccines: - were received in good condition - remained within the appropriate temperature range d uring shipment from the sponsor to the investigator's designated storage location - have been confirmed by the sponsor as authorized for use proper storage of the study vaccines, including: - storage in a secure, locked, temperature -controlled location - proper storage according to the instructions specified on the labels PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 64 of 115 Confidential - appropriate record keeping and inventory of the study vaccines, including regular documentation of adequate storage temperature appropriate use of the study vaccines, including: - use only in accordance with the approved protocol - proper handling, including confirmation that the vaccine has not expired prior to adminis tration - appropriate documentation of administration of vaccines to study subjects including: date, dosage, batch/serial numbers, expiration dates, unique identifying numbers assigned to subjects and study vaccines, and time of vaccine administration. This information will be maintained in an accountability log that will be reviewed by the site monitor. proper reconciliation of all study and non -study vaccines received from the sponsor. Reconciliation is defined as maintaining records of which and how many vaccines were received, which vaccines (and volume thereof) were administered to subjects, wh ich vaccines were destroyed at the site, and which vaccines were returned to the sponsor, as applicable. proper adherence to the local institutional policy with respect to destruction of study vaccines. complete record keeping of vaccine use, wastage, return or destruction, including documentation of: - copy of the site's procedure for destruction of hazardous material - number of doses destroyed, date of destruction, destruction code (if available), method of destruction, and name of individual performing destruction Vaccines that have been stored differently from the sponsor's instructions must not be used unless the sponsor provides written authorization for use. In the event that the use cannot be authorized, the sponsor will make every effort to replac e the vaccine supply. All vaccines used in conjunction with this protocol must be stored separately from normal hospital/practice stocks to prevent unintentional use of study vaccines outside of the clinical trial setting. Monitoring of vaccine accountabi lity will be performed by the study monitor during site visits and at the completion of the trial as applicable dependent on the use of a computerized randomization system.

Exploratory immunogenicity assays will further understanding of the immune response to RSV and RSV vaccines. The measures of safety used in this study are based on previous study data and on comparable routine clinical and laboratory procedures. They include a close vigilance for, and stringent reporting of selected local and systemic adverse events routinely mon itored in vaccine trials as indicators of reactogenicity. In addition, selected laboratory tests will be performed pre - and post -vaccination. 6.2 Demographics, Medical History and Physical Examination Prior to study enrollment, demographic data will be collec ted from the subject, including: gender, race, ethnicity, age, height, weight, and body mass index. Medical history will also be collected, including but not limited to any medical history that may be relevant to subject eligibility for study participatio n such as prior vaccinations, concomitant medications, and previous and ongoing illnesses or injuries. Relevant medical history can also include any medical history that contributes to the understanding of an adverse event that occurs during study particip ation, if it represents an exacerbation of an underlying disease/preexisting problem. A general physical examination is to be performed by a qualified health care practitioner and will include, at a minimum, measurement of the following vital signs: respi ratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature (oral). It will also include assessment of general appearance; examination of the head, ears, eyes, nose and throat (HEENT); examination of skin; auscultation of heart and lungs; palpation of th e abdomen; and examination of extremities. \"Qualified health care practitioner\" refers to any licensed health care professional who is permitted by institutional policy to perform physical examinations and who is identified within the site's roles and resp onsibilities log. At clinic visits after enrollment subjects will undergo a symptom -directed physical examination. This is a physical examination that will include at a minimum measurement of vital signs (respiratory rate, heart rate, and blood pressure), body temperature (oral), a check of general appearance, as well as examination of organ systems that are relevant to PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 67 of 115 Confidential the investigator based on review of the subject's reported adverse events, review of systems, or concomitant medication use. Data on subject demographics, medical history, and physical exams will be recorded in the source documents and in the associated e CRFs as included in the eCRF instructions provided by NVD. 6.3 Immunogenicity Measurements Serum anti -RSV neutralizing antibody titers will be evaluated for all subjects by plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNA). Samples will be collected at the followi ng time points: Visit 1 (baseline, pre -vaccination) Visit 5 (28 days after the first dose) Visit 9 (28 days after the second dose) Visit 12 (6 months after the first dose) Binding antibody to the RSV proteins F, G (G a and G b), and N by a microsp here-based fluorescence linked immunosorbent assay, multiplexed using Luminex\u00ae technology will be evaluated using the same samples. The binding assays are needed to (i) distinguish immune responses following immunization versus natural infection, and (ii) assess the ratio of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) and non -NAb to the F protein. All testing will be conducted by qualified and cert ified laboratories. See section 3.5.1 and the Laboratory Manual in the Investigator Site File for more information. For assays not performed internally by NVD, data will be provided by external laboratories by EDT to NVD (see section 9 ). 6.4 Efficacy Measurem ents This study has no efficacy measurements. 6.5 Solicited Safety Measurements The term \"reactogenicity\" refers to selected signs and symptoms (\"adverse events\") occurring in the hours and days following a vaccination, to be collected by the subject for 7 consecutive days, using a pre -defined checklist in a diary card (i.e., solicited adverse events).

Each adverse event is to be assessed using the scoring system shown in Appendix B (local AEs) and Appendix C (systemic AEs). Solicited local adverse events: Solicited local AEs include: injection site induration injection site swelling injection site erythema injection site pain AEs will be recorded as absent, mild, moderate, or severe. Please see Appendix B for grading scales. Solicited systemic adverse events: Solicited systemic AEs include: body temperature (oral preferred) chills nausea generalized myalgia generalized arthralgia headache fatigue diarrhea loss of appetite cough rhinorrhea wheezing AEs will be recorded as absent, mild, m oderate, or severe.

Solicited local and systemic AEs and unsolicited AEs will be collected using diary cards for 7 days followin g any dose of vaccine or placebo. Subjects will be asked to take an oral temperature for the first 7 days after each dose and to record other systemic and local AEs that may develop, as well as any medications subjects have received. Reminder telephone calls at two and four days after each dose of vaccine or placebo will be used to remind the subject to record AEs in the diary cards and bring the diary cards to their next clinic visit. Telephone calls at 14 and 21 days after each dose of vaccine or placebo will be used to collect unsolicited AEs occurring since the last study contact, as well as any solicited AEs continuing beyond the 7 day period after vaccination. All AEs necessitating a non -scheduled physician visit, medical attention, or leading to withdrawal from the study will also be collected throughout the study, and all AEs will be monitored until resolution or, if the AE becomes chronic, a cause is identified. If an AE is unresolved at the conclusion of the study, a clinical assessment will be ma de by the investigator and the medical monitor to determine whether or not continued follow -up of the AE is warranted. The relationship of the study treatment to any AE and any SAE will be determined by the investigator as probably related, possibly relate d, or not related. Any SAEs will further be reported as related/suspected or not related. All AEs resulting in withdrawal of the subjects from the study will be summarized. In addition, all SAEs, NOCDs, and AESIs will be collected from the date of signed informed consent and at scheduled periodic reviews and will be followed up until the end of the study (approximately 393 days after the first dose of vaccine or placebo [saline]). This may include a period before and after an active treatment of investigat ional product. On an individual basis, SAE follow -up may take longer than the study duration, if the SAE is not resolved at the completion of the study. Monitoring for AESIs (see section 6.6.1.1 and Appendix A ) will be extended through 12 months after the second vaccination and will be accomplished by clinic visits or telephone follow -up calls as detailed in Table 2. All AESIs will be reported in the same manner as SAEs. A tabulation of all AESIs, categorized by MedDRA preferred terms and assessed relationship to study vaccine will be performed. The study staff must review the diary card with the subject at the next clinic visit (see section 3.2.5 ) and must directly record the solicited local and systemic adverse events, and other solicited reactions on the appropriate Local and Systemic Reactions eCRF. As described in Section 3.4.1 , all solicited adverse events that are legible must be recorded verbatim in the eCRFs, even if the values do not appear to be plausible (see section 3.2.5.3 and section 8.1 for more detail).

Therefore , an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational produ ct. This definition includes intercurrent illnesses or injuries and exacerbation of pre -existing conditions. NOTE: Every effort should be made by the investigator to evaluate new safety information reported by a subject (solicited and unsolicited AEs) for an underlying diagnosis and to capture this diagnosis as the event in the AE page. In other words, the practice of reporting only symptoms (e.g., \"cough\" or \"ear pain\") are better reported according to the underlying cause (e.g., \"asthma exacerbation\" or \"otitis media\"). All AEs will be monitored until resolution or, if the AE becomes chronic, a cause identified. If an AE is unresolved at the conclusion of the study, a clinical assessment will be made by the investigator and medical monitor whether contin ued follow -up of the AE is warranted. The severity of events reported on the Adverse Events eCRF will be determined by the investigator as: Mild: transient with no limitation in normal daily activity. Moderate: some limitation in normal daily activity. Severe: unable to perform normal daily activity. The relationship of the study treatment to an AE will be determined by the investigator based on the following definitions: 1. Not Related The AE is not related to an investigational vaccine if there is evidence that clearly indicates an alternative explanation. If the subject has not received the vaccine, the timing of the exposure to the vaccine and the onset of the AE are not reasonably r elated in PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 71 of 115 Confidential time, or other facts, evidence or arguments exist that reasonably suggest an alternative explanation, then the AE is not related. 2. Possibly Related The administration of the investigational vaccine and AE are considered reasonably related in time and the AE could be explained by exposure to the investigational vaccine or by other causes. 3. Probably Related Exposure to the investigational vaccine and AE are reasonably related in time and no alternative explanation has been identified. The relationship of the study treatment to an unsolicited AE will be determined by the investigator. Solicited AEs will not be evaluated for relationship to study vaccine and severity of solicited AEs is defined as described in section 6.5 . Adverse events will also be evaluated by the investigator for the co -existence of any of the other following conditions: \"Medically attended adverse event\": an adverse event that leads to an unscheduled visit to a healthcare practitioner. \"New onset of chronic dise ase\": an adverse event that represents a new diagnosis of a chronic medical condition that was not present or suspected in a subject prior to study enrollment. \"New onset of autoimmune disorder\": an adverse event that represents a new diagnosis of an aut oimmune disease that was not present or suspected in a subject prior to study enrollment. Please note: any solicited adverse event that meets any of the following criteria must also be entered as an adverse event on the Adverse Event eCRF: Solicited local or systemic adverse event leading to the subject withdrawing from the study or the subject being withdrawn from the study by the investigator. Solicited local or systemic adverse event lasting beyond 7 days' duration. Solicited local or systemic adverse events that lead to subject withdrawal from study vaccination. Solicited local or systemic adverse event that otherwise meets the definition of a serious adverse event (see section 6.6.2 ).

All subjects enrolled in the study will be monitored for AESIs for the entire follow -up period. The AESIs will be defined according t o the MedDRA preferred terms listed in Appendix A . The occurrence of any of these adverse events will be treated as a serious adverse event (SAE), meeting the criterion of a \"medically important event.\" Subjects will be assessed for diagnosis of an AESI a t the following clinic visits: Visit 1 (baseline, pre -vaccination) Visit 2 (7 days after the first dose) Visit 5 (28 days after the first dose; pre -second dose) Visit 6 (7 days after the second dose) Visit 9 (28 days after the second dose) Visit 10 (56 days after the second dose) Visit 11 (4 months after the first dose) Visit 12 (6 months after the first dose) Visit 13 (6 months after the second dose) At these visits a qualified health care practitioner listed on the site's responsibi lities and delegation logs will conduct a review of organ systems and a targeted physical exam, and will evaluate subjects for any new signs or symptoms that could indicate one of the AESIs listed in Appendix A. They will also interview the subject about r ecent medical history and any new diagnosis that could indicate an AESI. Medical records related to any new medical event or diagnosis will be requested, reviewed by the site staff, and recorded in the subject's source documents. In addition, subjects wil l be interviewed by phone at the following time points: Visit 3 (14 days after the first dose) Visit 4 (21 days after the first dose) Visit 7 (14 days after the second dose) Visit 8 (21 days after the second dose) Visit 14 (9 months after the first dose) Visit 15 (1 year after the first dose) PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 73 of 115 Confidential Visit 16 (1 year after the second dose) These phone calls will include a scripted interview to determine if the subject has had a new medical issue for which they visited a doctor, and if they had any new diagnosis since the last clinic visit. Any new diagnosis deemed to potentially be an AESI w ill be recorded in the subject's source documents, and the subject will be instructed to visit the site within the next 7 days. The subject will be instructed to bring any new medical records with them to the clinic for review. A diagnosis of an AESI will be reported in the same manner and time frame as an SAE using the VSAE form. The investigator must notify NVD within 24 hours. The AESI diagnosis, as well as any medications taken to treat the condition, will be recorded in the subject's source documents and on the Adverse Events eCRF. 6.6.1.2 New Onset of Chronic Disease New onset of chronic disease is defined as an illness that starts during the course of the study that did not exist prior to enrollment into the study and is likely to persist throughout the lifetime of the subject. A chronic disease is one that can be treated but for which no cure exists. For example, a new onset of asthma (occurs for the first time during t he study and has been evaluated longitudinally to ensure that a diagnosis of asthma is appropriate) is classified as a New Onset of Chronic Disease (NOCD). This is applicable for any chronic disease affecting any organ class that arises during the study that is likely to persist throughout the subject's lifetime (even if in remission). Infectious diseases, such as Hepatitis C virus or tuberculosis, are not considered NOCDs as there are antibiotics and antivirals that are potentially able to cure such diseas es (this is a generalizable cure and not specific to the subject). In case of doubt, diagnoses of new onset of chronic disease should be discussed with the study medical monitor. Any NOCD will be described in the medical chart/source documents and entered into the Adverse Events eCRF. 6.6.2 Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in one or more of the following: Death. Is life -threatening (i.e., the subject was, in the opin ion of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred); it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. Required or prolonged hospitalization. PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 2936 20 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 74 of 115 Confidential Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the event causes a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions). Congenital anomaly or birth defect. An important and significant medical event that may not be immediately life threatening or resulting in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require i ntervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Adverse events which do not fall into these categories are defined as non-serious . It should be noted that a severe adverse event need not be serious in nature and that a serious adverse event need not, by definition, be severe. Serious adverse events will be captured both on the VSAE form as well as on the AE eCRF. All SAEs will be evaluated by the investigator for relationship of the event to study vaccine. SAEs that are judged to be possibl y or probably related to the study vaccine should be reported to the sponsor as related (i.e., suspected) events. The relationship of the study treatment to an SAE will be determined by the investigator based on the following definitions: 1. Related/suspected The SAE is judged by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to the study vaccine on the AE CRF page (see section 6.6.1 ). 2. Not Related The SAE is not related if exposure to the study vaccine has not occurred, or the occurren ce of the SAE is not reasonably related in time, or the SAE is considered unlikely to be related to use of the study vaccine, i.e., there are no facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. The relationship of the study vaccine to an SA E will be determined by the investigator. In addition, SAEs will be evaluated by the sponsor or designee for \"expectedness.\" An unexpected AE is one that is not listed in the Investigator's Brochure or an event that is by nature more specific or more seve re than a listed event. In addition, a pre -existing event or condition that results in hospitalization should be recorded on the Medical History eCRF. If the onset of an event occurred before the subject entered the trial (e.g., any pre -planned hospitaliz ation for conditions like cosmetic PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 75 of 115 Confidential treatments or for non -emergency routine visits for a pre -existing condition), the hospitalization would not lead to an AE being classified as serious unless, in the view of the investigator, hospitalization was prolonged as a result of participation in the clinical trial or was necessary due to a worsening of the pre -existing condition. 6.6.3 Methods for Assessing and Recording AEs and SAEs The period of observation for AEs extends from the time the subject signs informed consent until he or she completes the specified safety follow -up period of approximately 1 year after receipt of the second dose of vaccine or terminates the study early (wh ichever comes first). AEs occurring after the informed consent form is signed but prior to receiving study vaccine/product will be documented as an adverse event and recorded on the Adverse Events eCRF and on source documents. However, AEs occurring prior to receipt of any study vaccine will be analyzed separately from \"treatment emergent\" AEs (AEs occurring after administration of the first study vaccine). All AEs meeting criteria for reporting, regardless of severity, will be monitored by the investigato r until resolution or stabilization. All subjects experiencing AEs - whether considered associated with the use of the study vaccine or not - must be monitored until symptoms subside and any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline, or until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, or until death, in which case a full pathologist's report should be supplied, if possible. All findings must be reported on an Adverse Events CRF and on the VSAE form, if necessary, which is part of the Investigator Site File. All findings in subjects experiencing AEs must be reported also in the subject's medical records. All SAEs which occur during the course of the trial, whether considered to be associated with the study vaccination or not, mu st be reported within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event by telephone or fax to NVD. Contact details for submitting SAEs to NVD or its designee and instructions for completion of documentation will be provided in a handout located in the Inve stigator Site File. All SAEs are also to be documented on the Adverse Events eCRF. Any medication or other therapeutic measures used to treat the AE will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF(s) in addition to the outcome of the AE. After receipt of the initial report, representatives of NVD will contact the investigator if it is necessary to obtain further information for assessment of the event. All SAEs must be reported by the investigator to his/her corresponding EC or IRB and applicable regulatory authorities in accordance with institutional policy/regulatory PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 76 of 115 Confidential requirements and adequate documentation of this n otification must be provided to the sponsor. NVD or its designee must also comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) related to the reporting of unexpected serious and non -serious adverse vaccine reactions (also referred to as \"SUSARs\") to the regulatory authority(ies) and the IRB/EC. If a SUSAR or other safety signal relating to use of one of the study vaccines is reported to NVD or its designee, the sponsor will communicate the information to the investigator and the investigator will be respo nsible for submitting this information to the EC or IRB and other relevant authorities. Post-Study Events Any suspected SAE that occurs outside of the protocol -specified follow -up period or after the end of the study but considered to be caused by the study vaccine must be reported to Novartis or its designee. These SAEs will be processed by Novartis or its de signee as during the course of the study, until 3 months after the last scheduled study visit. Instructions and contact details for collecting and reporting these suspected SAEs will be provided to the investigator. 6.6.4 Pregnancies To ensure subjects' safet y, each pregnancy in a subject on study vaccine must be reported to NVD within 24 hours of the site learning of its occurrence. If the subject agrees to submit this information, the pregnancy must be followed to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. This follow -up should occur even if intended duration of safety follow -up for the study has e nded. Pregnancy data must be recorded on a Pregnancy Report CRF (initial report) and Pregnancy Follow -Up CRF (outcome report) and reported to NVD. Contact details for submitting the case report forms will be described in the Investigator Site File. Any pr egnancy outcome meeting the definition of a SAE (see section 6.6.2 ) must also be reported on the VSAE Report Form.

Safety laboratory assessments from serum will include sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate (or CO 2), glucose, blood urea GT), bilirubin, WBC differential, RBC, RBC indic es, platelets, and mean platelet volume -reactive protein (CRP), D -dimer. Safety laboratory assessments from urine will include at a minimum protei n, glucose, and presence of red blood cells. All testing will be conducted by qualified and certified laboratories as outlined in the Laboratory Manual. Abnormal laboratory values will be defined following the FDA CBER Guidance for Industry \"Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive vaccine Clinical Trials\" dated September 2007, or the institution's normal ranges if they differ from CBER guidance. Please see Appendix D , E, and F. Retesting will not be performed in the case of abnormal values. 6.8 Other Mea surements The serum neutralizing antibody (NAb) and binding antibody responses against additional RSV strains and native or engineered RSV antigens at baseline and following vaccination will be performed in a subset of subjects, following evaluation of the primary and secondary immunogenicity evaluations and depending on the volume of serum remaining for additional testing. The predominant isotype of the RSV -specific serum antibody may be determined and the RSV -specific immune response against different RSV subgroup A and subgroup B strains may be evaluated. RSV group A and group B strains could include those with engineered alterations in the F and G glycoproteins and strains that lack the G glycoprotein. Different RSV antigens may include engineered, recom binant RSV antigens, such as an F antigen in which one or more known neutralizing epitopes has been blocked by the addition of a glycosylation site or F antigens locked in a defined conformation, such as a pre -fusion conformation. To make this determinatio n, the serum PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 78 of 115 Confidential samples may be mixed with a recombinant RSV antigen (potentially an antigen with engineered changes) before use in a neut ralization assay. Alternatively, the serum may be bound to an immobilized recombinant RSV antigen and then eluted before use in a neutralization assay or binding assay, or the fraction of serum that does not bind to an immobilized recombinant RSV antigen m ay be used in a neutralization assay or binding assay. These data will be entered into Source Documents if the assays are conducted internally at NVD, or will be transferred via EDT if the assays are conducted by external laboratories (see section 9.1 ). Testing and analyses to characterize the serum neutralizing antibody (NAb) to additional RSV strains may be performed after the Clinical Study Report (CSR) has been completed, in which case these data will be submitted as an addendum to the CSR. The se rum NAb and binding Ab assays described above will be performed in approximately the first 10 subjects enrolled in each of the four treatment groups of cohort 3 (135 \u00b5g of RSV F subunit vaccine without adjuvant, with MF59, or with aluminum hydroxide; or pl acebo), who agree to a separate Informed Consent and additional collection of blood samples. The time points for blood collection will be: Visit 1 (baseline, pre -vaccination) Visit 2 (seven days after the first dose) Visit 5 (28 days after the first dose) Visit 12 (six months after the first dose) In addition, cell mediated immunity assays will be performed. The frequency of B cells specific for RSV proteins will be determined by enzyme -linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) at the same time points, in order to evaluate the peak of plasmablast responses (Visit 2), the B cell memory responses (Visit 5), and for persistence of antibody responses (Visit 12). Subsequently, the analysis of the RSV -specific B -cell repertoire to explore the baseline immuni ty to RSV and the immune response to the RSV F subunit vaccine will be performed in a subset of these subjects, including those with the most pronounced response to the RSV F subunit vaccine in the non -adjuvanted, aluminum hydroxide - adjuvanted, and MF59 -adjuvanted treatment groups. The samples for the exploratory B cell repertoire analysis will be chosen based on the levels of baseline immunity and the level of response to the vaccine (as determined serologically and by ELISPOT), and on the distribution of samples between subjects who received placebo, unadjuvanted vaccine, PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 79 of 115 Confidential aluminum hydroxide -adjuvanted vaccine, or MF59 -adjuvanted vaccine. The selection will be based on the goal of the exploratory objective to understand the differences in the RSV -specific B cell repertoires elicited by natural infection and by the adjuvanted or unadjuvanted vaccine. Testing and analyses of the RSV -specific B -cell repertoire may be or may not be performed after the Clinical Study Report (CSR) has been completed, and these data will be submitted as an addendum to the CSR. B cells secreting RSV -specific antibodies will be enumerated by ELISPOT according to treatment group and time point evaluated for subjects in cohort 3 only. The diversity of the elicited B -cell receptors will be accomplished through sequence analysis of complementary DNA (cDNA ) from immunoglobulin (Ig) messenger RNA (mRNA) and functional, binding, and epitope mapping analyses of antibodies or antibody fragments expressed from those cDNAs. The Ig cDNAs will be cloned from plasmablasts obtained approximately one week after dosing and from memory B cells obtained at Visit 1 and at time points more than one week after dosing. 6.9 Data Monitoring Committee A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be implemented to review safety data during scheduled periodic reviews. DMC membership will consist of a minimum of 3 individuals who are external to the site and sponsor, including at least 1 statistician. Subjects w ill be enrolled in a stepwise manner in each of the three vaccine dosage cohorts (cohort 1: low dosage of RSV F subunit vaccine [45 \u00b5g], cohort 2: middle dosage of RSV F subunit vaccine [90 \u00b5g], and cohort 3: high of RSV F subunit vaccine [135 \u00b5g]). The DMC will review safety data, as described in the DMC charter and in the statistical analysis plan, after enrollment of the first 12 subjects in each cohort, and shortly after Visit 2 (seven days after the first dose), before proceeding with enrollment of the remaining subjects in each cohort. In addition, the DMC will review safety data, as described in the DMC charter and in the statistical analysis plan, after enrollment of each cohort has been completed before proceeding with enrollment of the subse quent cohort. Preferably, the DMC will firstly receive blinded data and only in case it is deemed necessary to evaluate unblinded data (either at group or subject level), unblinded information will be released to the DMC members only. In such a circumstanc e, an NVD independent statistician and a randomization programmer will have access to unblinded data. Criteria to assess safety will include, but may not be limited to, immediate AEs within 30 minutes, solicited and unsolicited AEs within 7 days and 28 da ys after each vaccination, respectively, SAEs (including AESI and NOCD), and clinical laboratory safety parameters. The specific roles and responsibilities of the DMC members and other personnel involved will be documented in the DMC charter.

Subjects will be included in the FAS if they have any evaluable serum samples at pre - and post-baseline. FAS populations will be analyzed \"as randomized\" (i.e., according to the vaccine a subject was designated to receive, which may be different from the vaccine the subject actually received). 7.3.4 Per Protocol (PP) Population, Immunogenicity Set All subjects in the FAS Immunogenicity Population who: Are not excluded due to reasons (see section 7.3.8 ) defined prior to unblinding or analysis Examples for s ubjects excluded due to other reasons than major protocol deviations are: - Subjects who withdrew informed consent - Premature withdrawals due to adverse events Exclusions need to be considered by objective/time point, i.e., sometimes not all data of a subject but only part of the subject's data will be removed from the PPS analysis. If a subject shows evidence of natural RSV infection during the trial they may no t be part of the PPS. However, if evidence of natural RSV infection occurs at Visit 9 or PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 85 of 115 Confidential later, that subject will be included in the PPS analysis through Visit 5, but will not be included in the PPS analysis from Visit 9 through the end of the study.

Results will be available after the Clinical Study Report is issued. 7.3.8 Protocol Deviations A protocol deviation is any change, divergenc e, or departure from the study design or procedures of a study protocol. An exclusion refers to a protocol deviation that is used to remove data from an analysis population at the time of analysis. Relevant protocol PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 86 of 115 Confidential deviations will be defined as exclusionary from the analysis according to protocol objectives and endpoints, which will be specified in the statistical analysis plan. Any deviation that affects the subject's rights, safety, or well - being and/or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data constitutes a major protocol deviation. Changes or alterations in the conduct of the trial which do not have a major impact on the subject's rights, safety or well -being, or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data are considered minor protocol deviations. Major and minor deviations will be reviewed to determine the final list of deviations that will be used for exclusion from the analysis set(s). This will be defined in the statistical analysis plan prior to unblinding. The following deviations are considered major: A subject received incorrect study vaccine or dose of study vaccine A subject m et withdrawal criteria during the study but was not withdrawn A subject received an excluded medication or vaccine A subject was enrolled but does not meet the protocol's eligibility criteria A subject with no safety data Inadvertent loss of sample s or data that support the analysis of primary objectives Failure to obtain informed consent prior to initiation of study -related procedures Falsifying research or medical records. Subjects who terminate study participation prematurely for reasons such as withdrawal of consent, adverse event (including death), or administrative reason do not represent protocol deviations, nor are the missing assessments that should otherwise have been collected for that subject later in the study considered protocol dev iations. Pre-specified reasons for delay or cancellation of study vaccination as reflected in sections 4.3 and 4.4 do not constitute protocol deviations. All protocol deviations will be classified into major and minor. Major protocol deviations will be summarized by vaccine, center (overall) and grouped into the different categories as defined above. The site monitor will keep the investigator informed of m inor and major protocol deviations, so that the investigator can comply with reporting these deviations to the local EC/IRB according to their institutional policy. Prior to unblinding, designated staff at the Sponsor will develop a memo that describes the selected deviations that are identified as exclusions from analysis populations. This memo will be included in the trial master file.

Distributions of subjects by sex and ethnic origin will be summarized. 7.4.2 Analysis of Primary Objectives 7.4.2.1 Statistical Hypotheses for Primary Objectives There are no statistical hypotheses being tested in the study. 7.4.2.2 Analysis Populations for Primary Objectiv es PPS will be used for the primary objective analyses. The primary immunogenicity analyses will be based on the per -protocol set. If the full analysis set (FAS) and PP differ by more than 10%, primary immunogenicity analyses will also be conducted on the FAS. 7.4.2.3 Statistical Methods for Primary Objectives For the primary immunogenicity analyses the following statistical methods will be applied: GMTs: For each treatment group within each cohort, GMTs of the serum anti -RSV NAb along with their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be computed by exponentiation of the corresponding log -transformed means and 95% CIs. The statistical analyses for GMTs will be conducted using an ANCOVA model with dosage and adjuvant as factors and baseline antibody level as covariate. Interactions between factors will be investigated and further described in the statistical analysis plan to be finalized and approve d before the start of the trial. Fold-rise: Proportions of subjects with a 4 -fold increase in serum anti -RSV NAb titer from baseline will be presented, for each treatment group within each cohort, together with their two -sided 95% Clopper -Pearson CIs. 7.4.2.4 Sample Size and Power Considerations of Primary Objectives Sample size is not driven by statistical assumptions for formal hypothesis testing as previous clinical trial data are not available and clinically meaningful group differences PRO -01 TEMP 06 / A tlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 88 of 115 Confidential are not established. In addition, values for a correlate of protection are not known at present stage. Nevertheless, some information from the neutralization assay for human serum was provided. Hence, the number of proposed subjects will be sufficient to provide a descriptive summary of the safety and immunogenicity of the RSV F subunit vaccine. Safety With 24 subjects in each active vaccine group of each cohort, the probability of observing at least one adverse event per group is 90%, if the actual rat e of the event is 9.1%. For placebo, with 72 subjects, for the same actual rate of the event, the probability to detect at least one event increases to 99.9%. When the frequency of an adverse event is greater than 17.5%, there is 99% probability of observ ing one or more subjects presenting with such an AE in each of the active vaccine groups. Immunogenicity With 22 evaluable subjects per group, a two -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for a single GMT of the anti -RSV NAb will extend 0.167 from the observed mean, assuming a standard deviation of 0.400 (in log scale). Analogously, with an observed proportion of subjects with 4 -fold increase in NAb titers from Visit 1 (baseline) to Visit 9 (28 days after the second dose) equal to 50%, the 95% CI around that value will be from 28.2% to 71.8% (Clopper -Pearson method). 7.4.2.5 Analysis of Safety Objectives 7.4.2.5.1 Analysis of Ex tent of Exposure The number of subjects who received one and two doses of vaccine will be summarized by vaccine group. 7.4.2.5.2 Analysis of Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Events and Other Reactions All solicited adverse events will be summarized according to defined severity grading scales.

Summary tables showing the occurrence of any local or systemic adverse event overall and at each time point will also be presented. Post-vaccination solicited adverse events reported from day 1 to day 7 will be summarized for the intervals day 1 -3, day 4 -7, day 1 -7 by maximal severity and by vaccine group, excluding the 30 minute measurement, which will be summarized separately. The severity of solicited local adverse events, including injection site induration, swelling, and erythema will be summarized according to categories based on linear measurement: 25 to 50 mm, 51 to 100 mm, >100 mm. Injection site pain and systemic reactions (except fever) occurring up to 7 days after each vaccination will be summarized according to \"mild\", \"moderate\" or \"severe\". Each solicited local and systemic adverse event will also be further summarized as \"none\" versus \"any\". Implausible measurements (for further definition see analysis plan) will be left out of the analysis. Use of antipyretics and analgesics will be summarized by frequency, by type of use (prophylactic versus treatment), and percentage of subjects reporting use. The influence of antipyretics and analgesics use on the occurrence of specific adverse events (e.g ., fever) will be assessed. Body temperature will be summarized by 0.5 \u00b0C increments from 36.0 \u00b0C up to 40 \u00b0C and will be broken down according by route of measurement. 7.4.2.5.3 Analysis of Spontaneously Reported Adverse Events All the adverse events occurring during the study, judged either as probably related, possibly related, or not related to vaccination by the investigator, will be recorded. The original verbatim terms used by investigators to identify adverse events in the CRFs will be mapped to preferre d terms using the MedDRA dictionary. The adverse events will then be grouped by MedDRA preferred terms into frequency tables according to system organ class. All reported adverse events, as well as adverse events judged by the investigator as at least poss ibly related to study vaccine, will be summarized according to system organ class and preferred term within system organ class. These summaries will be presented by vaccination group. When an adverse event occurs more than once for a subject, the maximal s everity and strongest relationship to the vaccine group will be counted.

Non-Key Exploratory Objectives Not applicable. 7.5 Planned Interim Analysis An Interim Analysis will be performed on the immunogenicity and safety data collected from all subjects at Visits 1, 5, and 9. There will not be any statistical penalties applied as the interim analysis will not trigger changes in the study conduct (e.g. sample size re -estimation, cancellation of vaccine groups, early stop). The site staff will remain blinded through the end of the study and will not have access to unblinded information. The study statistician and the statistical programmer will be the on ly NVD people to be unblinded at subject level (i.e. full unblinding) for the interim analysis. Other NVD personnel will only receive grouped unblinded information with no possibility to guess the treatment allocation for a single subject. A thorough desc ription of how data will be secured will be reported in the Data Security Plan (DSP). Details on the interim analysis conduct will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

Prior to enrollment of the first study subject, NVD or delegate will train investigators and/or their study staff on the study protocol, all applicable study procedures, documentation practices (including signing of the source data agreement (SDA, see section 8.1 ) and all electronic systems. CRFs supplied by the sponsor must be completed for each enrolled subject (se e section 7.3.1 for definition of enrolled subject). Documentation of screened but not enrolled subjects must be maintained at the site and made available for review by the site monitor. All data entries as well as study related documents will be checked by the sponsor and/or site monitor. In addition, the investigator and site staff will be made aware of the plans to monitor the data collected at the site. 8.1 Source Documentation Prior to the start of the study, the site staff participating in the study conduct will be trained on what documents will be required for review as source documentation (i.e., original records, laboratory reports, medical records, subject diaries). The kin ds of documents that will serve as source documents will be specified in the SDA. The SDA will be finalized and available for further review prior to first subject, first visit. In addition, source documentation must include all of the following: subject identification (on each page), eligibility and participation, proper informed consent procedures, dates of visits, adherence to protocol procedures, adequate reporting and follow -up of adverse events, documentation of prior/concomitant medication/vaccines, study vaccine receipt/dispensing/return records, study vaccine administration information, any data collected by a telephone conversation with the subject, and date of completion and reason. The subject or the subject's parents or legal guardian(s) must also allow access to the subject's medical records. Each subject, or the subject's parent(s) or legal guardian(s), must be informed of this prior to the start of the study and consent for access to medical records may be required in accordance with local r egulations. All safety data reported by subjects must be written down on source documents prior to entry of the data into CRFs. If there are multiple sources of information (e.g., diary card, verbal report of the subject, telephone contact details, medica l chart) supporting the diagnosis of an adverse event, these sources must be identified in the source documents, PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 93 of 115 Confidential discrepancies between sources clarified, the ultimate diagnosis must be justified and written in the source documents, and this diagnosis must be captured in the adverse event CRF (AE CRF). The AE CRF must also capture which source(s) of information were used to determine the adverse event (e.g., subject recall, medical chart, diary card, and/or other sources). 8.2 Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification A contract research organization (CRO) may be involved in the monitoring of protocol conduct and data entry. If a CRO is involved in study oversight, the name and address of this CRO will be located in the investigator site file. Prior to enrollment of the first study subject, NVD will develop a Clinical Monitoring Plan to specify how monitoring will be performed for the study. Study progress will be monitored by NVD or its representative (e.g., a CRO) as frequently as necessary to ensure: that the rights and well -being of human subjects are protected the reported trial data are accurate, complete, a nd verifiable from the source documents and the conduct of the trial is in compliance with the current approved protocol/amendment(s), GCP and applicable regulatory requirements Contact details for the team involved in study monitoring will be identified in a handout located in the Investigator Site File. Study data recorded on CRFs will be verified by checking the CRF entries against source documents in order to ensure data completeness and accuracy as required by study protocol. Additional documents suc h as the investigator site file, pharmacy records, and informed consent documentation must also be available for review if requested. Arrangements for monitoring visits will be made in advance in accordance with the monitoring plan, except in case of emerg ency. The investigator and/or site staff must make source documents of subjects enrolled in this study available for inspection by NVD or its representative at the time of each monitoring visit. These documents must also be available for inspection, verification and copying, as required by regulations, by officials of the regulatory health authorities (e.g., FDA, EMA and others) and/or ECs/IRBs. The investigator and study site staff must comply with applicable privacy, data protection and medical confidentiality laws for use and disclosure of information related to the study and enrolled subjects.

Data entered onto eCRFs are stored on a secure website. The data collected on this secure website are assimilated into an electronic data capture (EDC) system, which is complian t with 21 Part 11 policies of the Code of Federal Regulations. The data system includes password protection and internal quality checks. The EDC will be designed and validated by NVD prior to activation for data entry by sites. The investigator or designat ed delegate must review data entered and electronically sign the eCRFs to verify their accuracy. Access to the EDC system for data entry or review will require training and distinct individual access code assignments to those site staff members who will be entering study data and those involved in study oversight who may review study data. Data are collected within EDC, to which the sponsor and site monitors have exclusively \"read only\" access. eCRF data will be reviewed routin ely by study personnel from NVD and clinical monitors. All serology results produced by Clinical Serology, NVD will be entered into the Seroad database by NVD's Clinical Serology Laboratory, Marburg. All results will be checked in the laboratory for valid ity and completeness. Electronic Data Transfer (EDT) is one method used by NVD for collecting laboratory data. The full -service laboratory (i.e., central laboratory) will send data as electronic files by a secured method (e.g., via diskette, CD, as an enc rypted file attachment on electronic mail, or as a direct transfer into a specified server directory) to NVD's BCDM department. The data file is pre -processed and loaded by a member of the BCDM team into the study database. The laboratory will submit a res ults file containing the tests and the results as specified in the protocol. If the laboratory provides the service, it will also submit a Demography (DEMOG) file containing the subject's demographic information. If the file includes results of data blinde d to personnel in clinical research, the source will provide a separate results file that will be loaded into a separate laboratory table. For this protocol, immunology laboratory data and/or safety laboratory data from external laboratories will be trans mitted via EDT.

The monitors and the sponsor are the only parties that can generate a query. For eCRF trials, all corrections and clarifications will be entered into the EDC and will be identified by the person entering the information, the reason for the change, as well as the time of the changes made. If changes are made to a previously and elec tronically signed CRF, the investigator must confirm and endorse the changes. 9.3 Data Coding Procedures Coding of Adverse Events, Medical History, and Prior and Concomitant Medications will be performed using standard dictionaries as described in the Data M anagement Plan. 9.4 Data Protection NVD respects the subjects' rights to privacy and will ensure the confidentiality of their medical information in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. The sponsor as Data Controller according to the European Directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data [ 95/46/EC ] confirms herewith compliance to Directive 95/46/EC in all stages of Data Management.

The investigator must consult a NVD representative before disposal of any study records, and must notify the sponsor of any change in the location, disposition, or custody of the study files. Essential documents must be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applicatio ns in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. \"Essential documents\" are defined as documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a trial and the quality of the data produced. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor. The Committee for Human Medicinal Products for Hum an Use (CHMP) requires retention for the maximum period of time permitted by the institution, but not less than 15 years (ICH E6, 4.9.5 ). It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer ne ed to be retained ( ICH E6, 5.5.12 ). These principles of record retention will also be applied to the storage of laboratory samples, provided that the integrity of the stored sample permits testing.

Before the start of the trial, the investigator will have the informed consent and any other materials that will be provided to the subjects r eviewed and approved by the IRB/EC. This review and approval will be documented and stored with other study documents. The investigator or designee must fully inform the subject or legal guardian of all pertinent aspects of the trial. A copy of the written informed consent will be given to the subject or the designee. The subject/designee must be allowed ample time to ask about the details of the trial and to make a decision as to whether or not to participate in the study. The subject and/or legal guardian must sign the consent form indicating their agreement to participate in the study before any study -related procedures are conducted. If the subject and/or legal guardian is unable to read and write, a witness must be present during the informed consent discussion and at the time of informed consent signature. Prior to the start of the study, NVD will provide to investigators a separate document with a proposed informed consent form that complies with the ICH GCP guideline and regulatory requirements and i s considered appropriate for this study. Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by the investigator must be agreed to by NVD before submission to the IRB/EC and a copy of the approved version must be provided to the NVD monitor after IRB/EC app roval. Women of child bearing potential should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the cont raception requirements indicated in the protocol for the duration of the study. If case of doubts on the ability of a subject to adhere to these requirements, that subject should not be allowed in the study PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 99 of 115 Confidential 12.3 Responsibilities of the Investigator and IRB/EC The protocol and the proposed informed consent form must be reviewed and approved by a properly constituted IRB/EC before study start. Properly constituted IRB/EC is defined in ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 (R1), Section 3 ( ICH 1997 ). A signe d and dated statement that the protocol and informed consent have been approved by the IRB/EC must be given to NVD before study initiation. Prior to study start and at any time the protocol is amended during study conduct, the investigator is required to s ign a protocol signature page confirming his/her agreement to conduct the study in accordance with these documents and all of the instructions and procedures found in this protocol and to give access to all relevant data and records to NVD monitors, audito rs, Novartis Clinical Quality Assurance representatives, designated agents of NVD, IRBs/ECs, and regulatory authorities as required. If an inspection of the clinical site is requested by a regulatory authority, the investigator must inform NVD immediately that this request has been made. The investigator is also responsible for the following: maintaining a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom the investigator has delegated significant trial -related duties demonstrating the capability of rec ruiting the required number of suitable subjects within the recruitment period demonstrating sufficient time and staffing to properly conduct and complete the study within the agreed trial period ensuring that all persons assisting with the study are adequately informed about the protocol, the investigational product(s), and their study -related duties and functions ensuring that appropriately trained health care professionals are responsible for all study -related medical decisions and for ensuring appropriate medical care of subjects experiencing any adverse event related to the study if permission to do so is given by the subject, ensuring that the subject's primary healthcare provider is infor med of the subject's participation in the study. The investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes of the protocol without agreement by the sponsor and prior review and documented approval/favourable opinion from the IRB/IEC of an amendm ent, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to trial subjects, or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial (e.g., change in monitor(s), change of telephone number(s)). In addition, the investiga tor, or person designated by the investigator, should document and explain any deviation from the approved protocol. PRO -01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Doc Number: 60686169 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics 08 JAN 14 Final Version 1.0 Protocol V122_01 Page 100 of 115 Confidential The investigator may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to trial subjects without prior IRB/IEC approval/favourable opinion. As soon as possible, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and, if appropriate, the proposed protocol amendment(s) should be submitted: (a) to the IRB/IEC for review and approval/favourable opinion, (b) to the sponsor for agreement and, if required, (c) to the regulatory authority(ies). 12.4 Protocol Adherence Investigators will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. Under no circumstances should the investigator contact NVD or its agents, if any, monitoring the trial to request approval of a protocol deviation, as no authorized deviations are permitt ed. If the investigator feels a change to the protocol would improve the conduct of the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon by NVD and approved by the IRB/EC it cannot be implemented. All signific ant protocol deviations will be recorded and reported in the Clinical Study Report. 12.5 Protocol Amendments An amendment is a written description of change(s) to or formal clarification of a study protocol which may impact on the conduct of the clinical study , potential benefit of the clinical study, or may affect subject safety, including changes of study objectives, study design, subject population, sample sizes, study procedures, or significant administrative aspects. An administrative change of a study pro tocol is a minor correction or clarification that has no significant impact on the way the clinical study is to be conducted and no effect on subject safety (e.g., change of telephone number(s), logistical changes). Protocol amendments must be approved by NVD, Health Authorities where required, and the IRB/EC. In cases when the amendment is required in order to protect the subject safety, the amendment can be implemented prior to IRB/EC approval. Notwithstanding the need for formal approval of a protocol am endment, the investigator is expected to take any immediate action required for the safety of any subject included in this study, even if this action represents a deviation from the protocol. In such cases, NVD should be notified of this action, the IRB/EC at the study site, and, if required by local regulations, the relevant health authority) should be informed within 10 working days.

This language is similar to what has been used in other trials. Safety review of data by the DMC has been changed from Visit 9 to Visit 6, prior to proceeding with enrollment of the subsequent cohort. Section 3.2.3 As a precedent, DMC reviews within and between cohorts will be performed based on safety data from 7 days after each vaccination. The Stopping/Pausing guidelines defined in Section 3.6 will of course still apply. Reference to \"28 days after each vaccination\" has been removed. Section 6.9 As described above for Section 3.2.3, the DMC review will be performed at 7 days after each vaccination. In the Times and Events Table, Visit Number row was moved up so it is next to Study Day row. Table 2 The rows were reordered to make the table easier to read. References to \"major\" and \"minor\" protocol deviations have been updated to \"reportable\" and \"not reportable,\" respectively.
