Problems can arise, though, when we go overboard ... and with many processed foods, that's easy to do. But by paying attention to what you eat, you can keep your sodium consumption on track. Here's what to watch for so you're getting the right amount while expecting (and beyond). Why you need sodium during pregnancy Sodium is a chemical element that works to regulate the fluid levels, temperature and pH levels of your body. Sodium is added to many foods and is one of the two elements (the other being chlorine) that combine to make up table salt (aka sodium chloride). Without enough sodium, your muscles, nerves and organs wouldn't function like they should. We need it! But we only need so much. During pregnancy, your body's volume of blood and other fluids increases \u2014 and sodium helps keep everything in balance. Monitoring your sodium intake is especially important if you're suffering from severe [morning sickness](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/morning-sickness/) or [hyperemesis gravidarum](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/complications/hyperemesis-gravidarum.aspx). You'll need more fluids and electrolytes \u2014 including sodium \u2014 to prevent dehydration. On top of that, iodine, which is added to some table salts, is critical for [your baby's brain and nervous system development](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/fetal-development/fetal-brain-nervous-system/). While [iodine deficiency](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/iodine-in-diet/) is rare in the U.S., too little of this important mineral during pregnancy can cause serious problems like miscarriage or abnormal brain development. How much salt should you consume during pregnancy? According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans established by the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the recommendation is up to about a teaspoon of salt a day \u2014 that's 6 grams of salt, or less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium. More Healthy Eating Tips Even during pregnancy, the same numbers apply. But sodium is in all sorts of prepared foods, which means the average person still consumes way too much. In fact, most Americans eat on average about 3,400 milligrams of sodium per day. Why too much salt can be unhealthy Even before you were pregnant, you likely felt the side effects of too much sodium. (Think about one of the times you ate a super-salty meal and felt overly stuffed and bloated.) That feeling is due to all the extra water your body is holding to try to flush out the excess sodium. Swelling of the face, hands, legs, ankles and feet \u2014 called [edema](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/symptoms-and-solutions/edema.aspx) \u2014 is already a very common [pregnancy symptom](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-symptoms/). But overdoing the salt in your diet during pregnancy could kick edema into overdrive. Beyond bloating and discomfort, too much sodium can cause serious health issues. Here's how: Regular excessive sodium consumption causes your body to hold onto too much water, which in turn increases the pressure of blood pumping through your veins and arteries. This forces the body to work harder than it should, leading to [high blood pressure](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/hypertension-during-pregnancy/) \u2014 which can lead to stroke, heart failure, kidney failure, stomach cancer, osteoporosis and more. The tricky part is that most excess salt comes not from the salt shaker, but from processed and restaurant foods where you might not expect it. Sneaky places where salt is hiding You may already know that processed foods like canned soups and frozen dinners contain significant amounts of salt, but these high-sodium sources may surprise you: - Bread: A slice of white bread has almost 150 mg of sodium. That may not seem like much at first, but when you have a bagel for breakfast, a sandwich for lunch, a roll at dinner \u2014 the total amount of sodium can add up. - Condiments: What you put on your food can greatly affect your sodium intake too. A tablespoon of ketchup has 154 mg of sodium, a tablespoon of barbecue sauce has 175 mg, a tablespoon of relish has 164 mg and a tablespoon of soy sauce has a whopping 1,005 mg of sodium. Bottled salad dressings are another culprit: Caesar has 178 mg, Italian 146 mg and French dressing has 134 mg per tablespoon. - Cereal: Your morning bowl of cereal may taste more sweet than salty, but some cereals contain a lot of salt. For instance, corn flakes, a variety with a healthier reputation, has 204 mg of sodium in a one-cup single serving. Individual servings of flavored oatmeal and grits can pack a big sodium punch, too. A packet of maple and brown sugar oatmeal has 260 mg of sodium, and a packet of butter-flavored instant grits contains 340 mg of sodium. - Sweet drinks: You wouldn't think that salt would be high on the list of ingredients for sugary drinks, but sometimes it is. Sixteen ounces of hot cocoa mix prepared with water has 280 mg. And you've heard of electrolytes, right? They can help when you're dehydrated? Well, sodium is a type of electrolyte \u2014 so some canned energy drinks have significant amounts of sodium in them, too. You don't need to cut out these foods completely during pregnancy, but you may want to keep their sodium content in mind when planning your meals. Healthier sources of sodium Sodium is found in most foods \u2014 vegetables, milk, eggs, plain yogurt, poultry, fish, fruit, grains and unsalted nuts \u2014 which means you can get your fill from these healthier natural sources. Whenever possible, choose fresh over processed options and, when cooking, try not to be too heavy-handed in sprinkling on the salt. You'll meet your daily requirement as long as you follow the [USDA's MyPlate guidelines](//www.choosemyplate.gov/). Tips for cutting back on sodium If you're looking to reduce your sodium intake, these changes can help: - Cook at home. It's important to try to eat more homemade meals, since food cooked at home has less salt than processed foods and snacks or food cooked in a restaurant. - Opt for fresh over prepared snacks. Choose fruit, vegetables, unsalted nuts, yogurt and the like for snacks instead of high-sodium treats. - Read the label. Remember, even foods that don't taste salty can contain surprising amounts of sodium. Take the time to check out the nutrition label to see just how much salt is in a product. - Use the salt shaker more sparingly. Even though most sodium comes from processed foods, you can further lower your intake by using cooking salt conservatively. Make your meals just as (if not more) tasty using spices, herbs, lemon, ginger or other salt-free seasonings. Reach for the salt with \"iodized\" on the label (not sea salt) to help you reach your iodine requirements. "}
