Italy is introducing the strictest rules in Europe from Friday in an attempt to nudge the vaccine-hesitant into getting the shot and prevent further lockdowns this winter, which could stymie Prime Minister Mario Draghi's plans for a full economic revival after seeing [6 percent growth this year](https://video.repubblica.it/dossier/governo-draghi/confindustria-draghi-in-italia-crescita-del-6-per-cento-ora-dovra-essere-duratura-e-sostenibile/396799/397509). By law, all workers must be able to show a so-called Green Pass, proving they are vaccinated against COVID-19 or have tested negative in the past 48 hours. Roughly 81 percent of Italians over 12 are [fully](https://www.governo.it/it/cscovid19/report-vaccini/) vaccinated. While polls suggest the majority of Italians are in favor of [vaccine passes](https://www.adnkronos.com/green-pass-obbligatorio-al-lavoro-cosa-ne-pensano-gli-italiani-il-sondaggio_3dXUlcVVhlK4l3Ks9nhVH7), there are still 3.8 million unvaccinated workers, many in strategic sectors and public services such as ports, trucking, health care and law enforcement, who will be unable to work.

The symbol of the rebellion has become the strategically vital port of Trieste, where workers \u2014 only 40 percent of whom are vaccinated \u2014 have announced a shutdown until the government calls off the new rules. \"Forget Christmas presents and say goodbye to the economic recovery,\" Giuliano Coslovich, a port worker, told the Italian newspaper [la Repubblica](https://www.repubblica.it/economia/2021/10/13/news/trieste_guida_il_fronte_dei_porti_potete_scordarvi_i_regali_di_natale_-322119573/). The paralysis of ports and trucks carrying foreign goods, particularly in the run-up to the holiday season, will force international leaders to put pressure on Draghi's government, he said. After the independent body with oversight on industrial action declared a strike at the port [illegal](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/italia/sciopero_portuali_trieste_illegittimo_green_pass_cosa_succede_domani_news_commissione_garanzia-6256981.html) on Thursday, the committee of port workers said Italy had become \"a dictatorship.\" About [one in three](https://www.agi.it/cronaca/news/2021-10-13/green-pass-rischio-paralisi-autotrasportatori-14176873/) truckers in Italy and 80 percent of foreign truckers are not vaccinated, according to haulage association Confetra, which could hinder the import of raw materials needed by Italy's construction industry and manufacturing base. Paolo Ugg\u00e8, national president of business federation Conftrasporto-Confcommercio, said there was a risk \"of paralysis.\" With 85 percent of produce in Italy moving by truck, farmers' group Coldiretti expressed concern at supply shortages to restaurants, and for shoppers to prepare for empty supermarket shelves \u2014 particularly [milk, fruit and vegetables](https://www.affaritaliani.it/politica/green-pass-85-della-spesa-a-rischio-niente-latte-frutta-e-verdura-762192.html). The ministry of transport on Thursday said that foreign truckers could travel through Italy without the Green Pass, but would need to stay in their cabin during unloading. Public services are at also risk. Some municipal [garbage](https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/milano/no-green-pass-allarme-mezzi-pubblici-e-rifiuti-1981161.html) authorities advised that collection was not guaranteed due to staff shortages. In Milan, one in four garbage collectors was expected not to show up for work. Security fears have also been heightened, with protesters planning to block motorways and ports following violent demonstrations in Rome last weekend. Efforts to control protests could be hindered by absentee police, with [estimates](https://torino.repubblica.it/cronaca/2021/10/13/news/un_poliziotto_su_tre_non_vaccinato_tra_i_celerini_di_torino-322111580/) that between 10 and 20 percent of officers are not vaccinated. Agricultural workers and caregivers, often migrant workers, are particularly likely to be unvaccinated, which puts the wine and winter vegetable harvests at risk, farmers' representatives [warned](https://www.ivg.it/2021/10/green-pass-confagricoltura-troppi-lavoratori-stranieri-non-vaccinati-o-con-vaccini-non-riconosciuti/). Families employing unvaccinated caregivers could find themselves breaking the law if they are unable to find alternative arrangements. Additionally, the cost of COVID-19 tests for the unvaccinated \u2014 totaling \u20ac180 per month at three tests per week \u2014 is unaffordable for many low-income workers. And the question of \"who pays?\" is dividing the governing coalition. The far-right League, and Beppe Grillo, founder of the 5Star Movement, have joined the opposition in calling for the state to cover testing costs. Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, told a political [rally](https://www.adnkronos.com/green-pass-obbligatorio-e-tamponi-letta-vs-salvini_4iEBQTfF7J4Y67rXe1Pdtn) on Thursday: \"We need free and fast tests for the millions of Italians who don't have the Green Pass. It is not possible that police, doctors, nurses stay at home without a salary. We ask that everyone can work and put food on the table for their children.\" Employers are free to pay for tests, but Giorgia Meloni of the far-right Brothers of Italy said it is \"intolerable\" the cost is offloaded onto businesses, many of which are already facing an economic crisis. For now, the Italian government is refusing to back down \u2014 with ministers viewing the cost as an additional incentive to get vaccinated. "}
