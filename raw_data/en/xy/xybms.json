Alexander claimed that maintaining a particular 'use' of the head, neck, and back leads to re-claiming the optimum overall physical functioning that is our evolutionary heritage.

One of aromatherapy's postulates is that essential oils have a \"spiritual dimension\" and can restore \"balance\" and \"harmony\" both to one's body and to one's life. One of its principles, the doctrine of signatures, holds that a plant's visible and olfactory characteristics reveal its \"secret\" qualities.

Some proponents have characterized essential oils as the soul or spirit of plants. aroma-tology: Form of aromatherapy that includes using essential oils to \"re-form\" character and to enhance spirituality.

According to the \"zodiacal man\" doctrine, each of the twelve signs (\"houses\") of the zodiac-constellations named Aries, Taurus, etc.-governs a different part of the human body. Proponents associate these zodiacal signs (\"sun signs\") with bodily parts (e.g., organs) and systems and with predisposition to disease in different bodily parts.

Kilner (1847-1920) of St. Thomas's Hospital, in London, invented this screen: two plates of glass, an eighth of an inch apart, containing an alcoholic solution of a dye (usually carmine or a coal-tar dye). \"Auric\" colors supposedly reveal the personal traits of the subject, such as impressionableness and \"spiritual arrogance.\" Proponents also associate \"auric\" colors with glands, organs, organ systems, and psychological states such as anger and boredom. aura and vibrational diagnosis: Mode of Natural and Macrobiotic Medicine that is a form of aura analysis. aura balancing (aura cleansing, aura clearing, aura healing, auric healing): Multiform method characterized by purported treatment of the \"energy field\" (\"aura\") around a person's head or body.
