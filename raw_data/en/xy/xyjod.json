As used by AIM, the Guidelines establish objective and evidence -based criteria for medical necessity determinations where possible. In the process, multiple functions are accomplished: To establish criteria for when services are medically necessary To assist the practitioner as an educational tool To encourage standardization of medical practice patterns To curtail the performance of inappropriate and/or duplicate services To advocate for patient safety concerns To enhance the quality of health care To promote the most efficient and cost -effective use of services The AIM guideline development process complies with applicable accreditat ion standards, including the requirement that the Guidelines be developed with involvement from appropriate providers with current clinical expertise relevant to the Guidelines under review and be based on the most up -to-date clinical principles and best p ractices. Relevant citations are included in the References section attached to each Guideline. AIM reviews all of its Guidelines at least annuall y. AIM makes its Guidelines publicly available on its website twenty -four hours a day, seven days a week. Copi es of the AIM Clinical Appropriateness Guidelines are also available upon oral or written request. Although the Guidelines are publicly -available, AIM considers the Guidelines to be important, proprietary information of AIM, which cannot be sold, assigned, leased, licensed, reproduced or distributed without the written consent of AIM. AIM applies objective and evidence -based criteria, and takes individual circumstances and the local delivery system into account when determining the medical appropriateness o f health care services. The AIM Guidelines are just guidelines for the provision of specialty health services. These criteria are designed to guide both providers and reviewers to the most appropriate services based on a patient's unique circumstances. In all cases, clinical judgment consistent with the standards of good medical practice should be used when applying the Guidelines. Guideline determinations are made based on the information provided at the time of the request. It is expected that medical nec essity decisions may change as new information is provided or based on unique aspects of the patient's condition. The treating clinician has final authority and responsibility for treatment decisions regarding the care of the patient and for justifying and demonstrating the existence of medical necessity for the requested service. The Guidelines are not a substitute for the experience and judgment of a physician or other health care professionals. Any clinician seeking to apply or consult the Guidelines is expected to use independent medical judgment in the context of individual clinical circumstances to determine any patient's care or treatment. The Guidelines do not address coverage, benefit or other plan specific issues. Applicable federal and state cover age mandates take precedence over these clinical guidelines. If requested by a health plan, AIM will review requests based on health plan medical policy/guidelines in lieu of the AIM Guidelines. The Guidelines may also be used by the health plan or by AIM for purposes of provider education, or to review the medical necessity of services by any provider who has been notified of the need for medical necessity review, due to billing practices or claims that are not consistent with other providers in terms of f requency or some other manner.

All rights reserved. 6 General Clinical Guideline Clinical Appropriateness Framework Critical to any finding of clinical appropriateness under the guidelines for a specific diagnostic or therapeutic intervention are the following elements: Prior to any intervention, it is essential that the clinician confirm the diagnosis or establish its pretest likelihood based on a complete evaluation of the patient. This includes a history and physical examination and, where applicable, a review of relevant l aboratory studies, diagnostic testing, and response to prior therapeutic intervention. The anticipated benefit of the recommended intervention should outweigh any potential harms that may result (net benefit). Current literature and/or standards of medical practice should support that the recommended intervention offers the greatest net benefit among competing alternatives. Based on the clinical evaluation, current literature, and standards of medical practice, there exists a reasonable likelihood that the intervention will change management and/or lead to an improved outcome for the patient. If these elements are not established with respect to a given request, the determination of appropriateness will most likely require a peer -to-peer conversation to und erstand the individual and unique facts that would supersede the requirements set forth above. During the peer -to-peer conversation, factors such as patient acuity and setting of service may also be taken into account. Simultaneous Ordering of Multiple Di agnostic or Therapeutic Interventions Requests for multiple diagnostic or therapeutic interventions at the same time will often require a peer -to-peer conversation to understand the individual circumstances that support the medical necessity of performing all interventions simultaneously. This is based on the fact that appropriateness of additional intervention is often dependent on the outcome of the initial intervention. Additionally, either of the following may apply: Current literature and/or standards of medical practice support that one of the requested diagnostic or therapeutic interventions is more appropriate in the clinical situation presented; or One of the diagnostic or therapeutic interventions requested is m ore likely to improve patient outcomes based on current literature and/or standards of medical practice. Repeat Diagnostic Intervention In general, repeated testing of the same anatomic location for the same indication should be limited to evaluation follo wing an intervention, or when there is a change in clinical status such that additional testing is required to determine next steps in management. At times, it may be necessary to repeat a test using different techniques or protocols to clarify a finding o r result of the original study. Repeated testing for the same indication using the same or similar technology may be subject to additional review or require peer -to-peer conversation in the following scenarios: Repeated diagnostic testing at the same faci lity due to technical issues Repeated diagnostic testing requested at a different facility due to provider preference or quality concerns Repeated diagnostic testing of the same anatomic area based on persistent symptoms with no clinical change, treatment, or intervention since the previous study Repeated diagnostic testing of the same anatomic area by different providers for the same member over a short period of time Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health. All rights reserved. 7 Repeat Therapeutic Intervention In general, repeated therapeutic intervention in the same anatomic area is considered appropriate when the prior intervention proved effective or beneficial and the expected duration of relief has lapsed. A repeat intervention requested prior to the expected duration of relief is not appropriate unless it ca n be confirmed that the prior intervention was never administered.

Confidence interva ls are usually reported to help explain how reliable, or precise, a result is. Hazard ratio (HR) is a measure of how often a particular event happens in one group compared to how often it happens in another group, over time. In cancer research, hazard rat ios are often used in clinical trials to measure survival at any point in time in a group of patients who have been given a specific treatment compared to a control group given another treatment or a placebo. A hazard ratio of one means that there is no di fference in survival between the two groups. A hazard ratio of greater than one or less than one means that survival was better in one of the groups. Odds ratio (OR) is a measure of the odds of an event happening in one group compared to the odds of the s ame event happening in another group. In cancer research, odds ratios are most often used in case -control (backward looking) studies to find out if being exposed to a certain substance or other factor increases the risk of cancer. For example, researchers may study a group of individuals with cancer (cases) and another group without cancer (controls) to see how many people in each group were exposed to a certain substance or factor. They calculate the odds of exposure in both groups and then compare the odd s. An odds ratio of one means that both groups had the same odds of exposure and, therefore, the exposure probably does not increase the risk of cancer. An odds ratio of greater than one means that the exposure may increase the risk of cancer, and an odds ratio of less than one means that the exposure may reduce the risk of cancer. Also called relative odds. Overall survival (OS) is the length of time from either the date of diagnosis or the start of treatment for a disease, such as cancer, that patients d iagnosed with the disease are still alive. In a clinical trial, measuring the overall survival is one way to see how well a new treatment works. Overall survival rate is the percentage of people in a study or treatment group who are still alive for a certain period of time after they were diagnosed with or started treatment for a disease, such as cancer. The overall survival rate is often stated as a five -year survival rate, which is the percentage of people in a study or treatment group who are alive five years after their diagnosis or the start of treatment. Also called survival rate. Progression -free survival (PFS) is the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease, such as cancer, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse. In a clinical trial, measuring the progression -free survival is one way to see how well a new treatment works. Relative risk (RR) is a measure of the risk of a certain event happening in one group compared to the risk of the same event happening i n another group. In cancer research, relative risk is used in prospective (forward looking) studies, such as cohort studies and clinical trials. A relative risk of one means there is no difference between two groups in terms of their risk of cancer, based on whether or not they were exposed to a certain substance or factor, or how they responded to two treatments being compared. A relative risk of greater than one or of less than one usually means that being exposed to a certain substance or factor either i ncreases (relative risk greater than one) or decreases (relative risk less than one) the risk of cancer, or that the treatments being compared do not have the same effects. Also called risk ratio. Response rate is the percentage of patients whose cancer s hrinks or disappears after treatment. References National Cancer Institute (NCI).

There are multiple different technologies which can be utilized for IGRT including ultrasound visualization, stereoscopic x -ray guidance, computed tomo graphy based guidance and continuous intra -fraction position monitoring. Both the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and the American College of Radiology (ACR) have published descriptive overviews and guidance related to the available methods , performance, quality assurance, limitations and safety aspects of image -guided therapy. IGRT is an integral part of the delivery of highly conformal treatments such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBR T), and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Recognition of this fact has resulted in changes to the current procedural terminology (CPT) definitions such that the technical aspect of IGRT is now bundled with IMRT delivery. Similarly, image guidance procedures have always been bundled for SBRT and SRS. When highly tailored dose distributions such as IMRT and stereotactic radiation therapy are not being utilized, sub-centimeter precision is not generally needed and accurate patient setup is achieved with other t echniques. These include patient immobilization with custom treatment devices like body molds or thermoplastic masks, placement of tattoos aligned to a 3 -dimen sional laser array in the treatment room and offline review of port verification films. Small dai ly setup uncertainties exist and these are taken into account in the target expansion process where an additional margin is added to the gross tumor volume (GTV) to create the clinical target volume (CTV) and ultimately the planning target volume (PTV) dur ing the treatment planning process. Pretreatment image acquisition and isocenter shifting has been suggested as a strategy to allow a safe reduction in PTV margins. By decreasing the volume of normal tissue exposed to radiation, the use of IGRT with 3D con formal radiation or IMRT has been suggested as a way to reduce toxicity, allow an increase in the radiation dose, or both. This has been most extensively studied in prostate cancer, where evidence of a dose response and improved freedom from failure with d ose escalation from 70 Gy to 78 Gy was demonstrated in a randomize d trial of intermediate to high -risk patients treated with radiotherapy. The higher dose treatment was associated with increased rectal toxicity and this was correlated with the proportion o f the rectal volume receiving > 70 Gy. This prompted efforts to dose escalate beyond 78 Gy and simultaneously decrease normal tissue toxicity by using IGRT, IMRT, and ultimately image -guided IMRT. When used with 3D conformal radiation, IGRT has been shown to reduce late toxicities after prostate cancer radiotherapy. A study by Gill showed that patients treated with IGRT had significantly lower rates of > grade 3 urinary frequency (7% vs 23%), > grade 2 diarrhea (3% vs 15%) and fatigue (8% vs 23%) compared t o patients treated without IGRT despite higher dose treatment in the IGRT patients. Another report by Singh demonstrated that treatment with IGRT significantly decreased reports of post -treatment rectal pain (OR 0.07), urgency (OR 0.27), diarrhea (OR 0.009 ) and change in bowel habits (OR 0.18) compared to patients treated without IGRT. There was no difference in genitourinary symptoms reported in that study. Multiple reports have also shown reduced late toxicities after high dose IMRT for prostate cancer co mpared to 3D conformal rad iotherapy. Zelefsky reported 10 -year follow -up comparing toxicity for prostate patient s treated Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health. All rights reserved. 10 with IMRT vs 3D conformal radiotherapy and found that > grade 2 gastrointestinal complaints were significantly lower i n the IMRT grou p (5% vs 13%). One criticism of these studies is that they were performed in the pre - IGRT era and it is unclear whether IGRT and IMRT both independently reduce tox icity. Comparing 3D and IMRT for patients who were all treated with implanted fiducial based image -guidance, IMRT resulted in significantly lower rectal doses and su bsequent late rectal toxicity. Finally, the use of image -guided IMRT (IG -IMRT) with implanted fiducial markers has been shown to improve 3 -year biochemical control and decrease late ur inary toxicity in high -risk prostate patients compared to patients treated to th e same dose (86.4 Gy) with IMRT but without I GRT. Daily IGRT has been compared to weekly IGRT for definitive treatment of prostate cancer. Patients treated with daily image gui dance experienced decreased treatment -related toxicity and improved biochemical disease -free survival compared to weekly IGRT. Studies of post -prostatectomy IMRT have demonstrated superior dose distribution to the target volume with the use of IMRT, as com pared with 3D conformal radiation delivery, with better sparing of nearby critical healthy tissue structures and less severe toxicity -related morbidity. The use of pre treatment cone beam CT image - guidance to a median dose of 68.4 Gy has been compared to po st-operative radiotherapy using weekly port films to a dose of 64.8 Gy. Despite treatment to a higher dose, the IGRT group was noted to have similar genitourinary an toxicities. Pretreatment corrective 19% of cases , respecti vely, the use of pre treatment imaging. The ACR -ASTRO practice parameter for IGRT indicates that \"when the target is not clearly visible and bony anatomy is not sufficient for adequate target alignment, fi ducial markers may be needed.\" For soft tissue targets such as the prostate, implanted fiducial markers have been validated as an accurate way to localize the target when using orthogonal imaging. Based on this r esearch in prostate cancer, use of implanted fiducial markers for other soft tissue targets located in close proximity to critical structures is appropriate when needed to safely reduce PTV margins and reduce the risk of late complications. In the setting of head and neck cancer, IGRT has been shown to allow a safe reduction of margin expansion and the ability to detect significant anatomic changes which m ight benefit from re -planning. Chen has reported a series of 225 consecutively treated head and neck ca ncer patients treated with image -guided IMRT. IGRT was performed with either kilovoltage or megavoltage volumetric imaging prior to each treatment. The first 95 patients were treated with a 5 mm CTV to PTV expansion and the following 130 patients were trea ted with a 3 mm expansion. Two -year local control was equal for the two groups. Examination of the treatment failures did not reveal any marginal recurrences in either cohort. The authors concluded that when IGRT is used, the CTV to PTV margin can safely b e reduced to 3 mm. A subsequent report included an additional 134 patients with 3 mm margin expansions (264 total) and found that the 3 -year locoregional control was equal in the two groups. Compared to the 5 mm margin group, the 3 mm margin patients had a lower incidence of gastrostomy -tube dependence at 1 year (10% vs 3%; P = .001) and esophageal stricture (14% vs 7%; P = .01). IGRT can also help identify patients who would benefit from adaptive replanning to prevent overdose of critical structures such as the spinal cord if significant weight loss occurs during treatment. Essentially all of the research around IGRT for head and neck cancer has been performed in the setting of IMRT. There are no data supporting the use of IGRT for head and neck cancer pati ents treated with 3D conformal radiotherapy. IGRT in the non -IMRT setting can be justified in cases where the use of surface tattoos and standard immobilization techniqu es are known to be inadequate. In obese patients with deep seated tumors of the abdomen and pelvis, surface landma rks are known to be inaccurate. In a study performed before the term image -guidance was coined, the authors report the need to shift an average of 11.4 mm in left -right axis and 7.2 mm in the superior -inferior axis in order to p roperly align obese patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy for prostate cancer based on pretreatment portal imaging. Wong has also reported that using computed tomography based IGRT, shifts of greater than 10 mm were needed 21.2% of the time to correctly p osition the prostate in moderately to severely obese patients (BMI > 35). This was significantly more than shifts needed in normal weight, overweight and mildly obese patients. ASTRO has used this scenario as an example of where IGRT may be required in con junction with three -dimensional conformal radiotherapy in their Health Policy Coding Guidance document. A recent study of the setup accuracy for lung cancer treatment showed that when compared to tattoos, using cone beam CT registration to the spine and carina improved target coverage approximately 50% of the time. Even using skin tattoos, however, the combined lung and nodal targets were found to be within the PTV over 97% of the time. Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health.

Liu evaluated respiratory related tumor motion in 152 patients with lung cancer and found that motion in the superoinferior (SI) axis was > 0.5 cm in 39% of patients and > 1 cm in 11% of patients. The degree of respiratory cycle related motion was more pronounced with smaller lesions and with tumo rs further from the lung apex. Four dimensional CT (4DCT) scan planning coupled with IMRT is associated with improved overall survival (HR 0.64) and a decreased risk of > grade 3 pneumonitis (HR 0.33) compared to 3D conformal radiotherapy. The volume of lung receiving 20 Gy (V20) was significantly lower in the 4DCT/IMRT group. The American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 76 guidelines summarized the adequate methods to account for this respiratory motion including 4DCT, slow CT, inhale/ exhale/breath -hold CT, respiratory gating fiducial markers or external markers to signal respiration, breath hold, ab dominal compression for shallow breathing and real time tracking. There are no studies supporting the use of IGRT for lung canc er in the 3D conformal setting. With left sided breast cancers, there is concern about cardiac toxicity due to the proximity of t he heart to the treatment field. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has been used to decrease the cardiac dose during left sided radiation treatment. Image -guided deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) techniques have been demonstrated to reduce ca rdiac exposure to radiation. A feasibility of IGRT for cardiac sparing in patients with left-sided breast cancer was investigated in a prospective study authored by Borst. Nineteen patients with left - sided breast cancer were treated with the deep inspirati on breath hold (DIBH) technique during IGRT. Use of DIBH in these patients reduced mean cardiac dose (1.7 Gy vs 5.1 Gy), the maximum dose (37 Gy vs 49 Gy) and the volume of heart receiving 30 Gy (0.3 cc vs 6.3 cc) compared with the free breathing technique . Similar results have been described in a larger series of 50 patien ts recently published by Cosma. Patients were eligible for inclusion in this study if an absolute volume of 10cc received more than 50% of the prescription dose (D10cc > 50%) based on criteria described by Wang. In these patients, the D10cc was reduced from 34.8 Gy for the free breathing group to 6.7 Gy for the DIBH g roup ( P < .001). For the majority of cases treated with 3D conformal radiotherapy, there is no evidence that the routine use of IGRT results in clinical benefit. Regarding clinical outcomes associated with IGRT, a recent review article concluded that \"results of current and future clinical trials will hopefully demonstrate the net gain in therapeutic ratio from application o f IGRT technologies and the onus lies on the radiation oncology community to take up the challenge of demonstrating the benefit of expensive IGRT approaches.\" In the treatment of non -melanoma skin cancer, superficial x -rays and electron beam therapy are us ed as definitive or post -operative treatment. ASTRO recently published a clinical practice guideline on radiation for basal and squamous skin cancer. The guideline panel stated that \"for local treatment of skin targets, the task force emphasizes the import ance of regular and frequent visual confirmation of surface coverage by the treating radiation oncologist (i .e., biweekly \"see -on-table\" verification). Daily imaging is neither necessary nor useful when treating with electron beam, ELS, or skin surface bra chytherapy.\" ELS refers to electronically generated low energy sources up to 120 kV. IGRT is not appropriate for the treatment of non -melanoma skin cancer with low energy or superficial radiation. Multiple publications have documented the additional radia tion exposure which occurs in conjunction with IGRT. Patient doses range from 1 -3 mGy for gantry mounted kV systems to between 10 and 50 mGy per image for cone beam and fan beam CT scans. As with any medical procedure, the risks of radiation exposure must be weighed against the benefits of daily imaging. In situations where there is a lack of demonstrable benefit, concern about potential harms of this technology are relevant. Even in clinical scenarios where IGRT is considered medically necessary, the techn ique chosen should expose the patient to the minimum amount of radiation needed to achieve adequate visualization. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends using IGRT when using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and when 3D conf ormal radiation or IMRT is used with steep dose gradients around the target, organs at risk are in close proximity to target tissues and when utilizing gating or other motion management techniques. For breast cancer, NCCN states that routine use of daily i maging is not recommended. Society Recommendations ASTRO/ACR - The American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and The American College of Radiology (ACR) have published practice guidelines for image -guided radiation therapy (IGRT). The technologies for Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health. All rights reserved. 12 performing IGRT are described. The document also reviews suggested qualifications and responsibilities of the personnel involved in the performance of IGRT. The authors note that IGRT can be used to enhance either 3D conformal radiotherapy or intensity mo dulated radiation therapy (IMRT) but do not elaborate on clinical necessity for IGRT wi th either of these modalities. IGRT is noted to be a necessary and integral part of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Elements of interfraction and intrafracti on target motion are discussed. Fiducial marker placement and migration are reviewed. As part of the process of IGRT implementation, it is suggested that the radiation oncologist develop clinical guidelines outlining when physician involvement in verificat ion of patient positioning is needed. No clinical outcomes are discussed. Clinical Indications Image guidance, any modality, is appropriate when ANY of the following conditions are met: Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is being utilized Proto n beam therapy is being utilized Use of IGRT will allow significant reduction of radiation dose to sensitive normal structures, for example: o Left-sided breast cancer treatment with deep inspiration breath hold technique (DIBH) for cardiac sparing is being utilized Implanted fiducial markers have been placed Head and neck cancer Prone breast radiotherapy The treatment field abuts a previously irradiated field There is significant setup variation affecting the treatment target, for example: o Individual is morb idly obese (BMI > 35) and receiving treatment of tumors in the mediastinum, abdomen or pelvis o There is significant organ movement due to respiration and a 4D planning CT scan was performed with documentation demonstrating that the treatment plan addresses tumor motion that is both accounted for and managed Frequency When authorized, image guidance should be performed at the minimum frequency needed to assure proper patient positioning. Exclusions Image guidance not meeting any of the above criteria is considered not medically necessary including, but not limited to: IGRT when used in conjunction with superficial x -rays or electron beam therapy in the treatment of non - melanoma skin cancer.

Several of these procedures are specifically described in the CPT\u00ae code definition including total body irradiation, hemibody radiation and per oral or endocavitary radiation. This code may al so be used to report additional work and effort when a patient receives brachytherapy or concurrent chemotherapy along with a course of external beam radiation therapy. This code should not be used to report the work effort which is specifically described another CPT\u00ae code including but not limited to intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or intraoperative (IORT). Special physics consult , CPT\u00ae code 77370, describes work performed by a qualified medic al physicist to address a specific question or problem related to a complex radiation therapy plan. This only applies when the query to the physicist is beyond the scope of the routine physics work effort associated with radiation therapy planning and deli very. In response to a physician request, the physicist prepares a customized written report specifically addressing the issue in question. A special physics consult may be appropriate in cases of brachytherapy where the physicist is directly involved or w hen an a composite plan is generated by the physicist to reflect cumulative doses from different radiation modalities such as photons, electrons, charges particles and gamma rays. A special physics consult is also medically necessary when radiation dose to a fetus or medical device such as pacemaker needs to be measured. Special physics consult is appropriate when the physicist performs a fusion multiple images sets with or without associated dose distributions to be used by the physician in the development or analysis of a treatment plan. This code should not be used when fusion is performed by a non-physicist. A special physics consult may also apply to other specific treatment -related questions when ordered by the radiation oncologist and appropriate docu mentation is provided. Clinical Indications Special treatment procedure is indicated when extra planning time and effort can be documented for ANY of the following: Concurrent chemotherapy Brachytherapy Proton therapy Total body or hemibody radiation Pediatric patient requiring anesthesia Hyperthermia Reconstruction of previous radiation plan Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) Other (documentation of special circumstances or time consuming plan required) Special physics consult is indicated when requested by physician for ANY of the following: Brachytherapy Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health.

Bone metastases can be seen with any cancer histology and affects more than 250,000 patients per year in the U .S. It has been estimated that up to 80% of patients with solid cancers will develop painful bone metastases to the pelvis, spine or extremities during the course of their illness. Metastases to the bone can cause accelerated bone breakdown which may result in pain, pathologic fracture and nerve or spinal cord compression resulting in sensory loss or motor weakness. Laboratory abnormalities may include hypercalcemia and myelosuppression. Radiation the rapy has long been used to palliate pain and other symptoms of bone metastases with excellent results. There have been multiple prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials comparing different radiation fractionation schemes for bony metastases. Mos t of these trials have excluded patients with spinal cord compression or pathologic fracture at presentation. All of these trials, as well as several subsequent meta - analyses of these data, have concluded that for uncomplicated patients a single fraction o f 8 Gy provides equivalent palliation to more prolonged fractionation over 1 to 4 weeks. The overall response rate with either regimen was approximately 60% with about 24% of patients demonstrating a complete response to treatment. Acute toxicity was found to be equivalent or better in the single fraction arms. There was no significant difference in pathologic fracture risk or subsequent spinal cord compression. The main difference which has been demonstrated is a higher rate of re -treatment with single fra ction treatment vs more prolonged fractionation (20% vs 8%). Because of the higher rate of re -treatment with single fraction radiotherapy, the use of fractionated regimens has been suggested for patients with bony metastasis from prostate and breast cancer s. Analysis of the Dutch Bone Metastasis Study found equal pain relief and duration in patients with favorable prognosis. This has also been studied prospectively by the RTOG which looked specifically at whether prolonged fractionation resulted in superior palliation in patients with breast and prostate cancers. It was concluded that both single fraction and multifraction regimens were equally effective even in this favorable group of patients. The breast cancer expert panel of the German Society for Radiat ion Oncology (DEGRO) recommends fractionated regimens for breast cancer patients with oligometastatic bony metastasis and when the therapeutic goal is stabilization of disease as opposed to pain control. The NCCN guidelines for prostate cancer recommend th at 8 Gy as a single dose be used instead of 30 Gy in 10 fractions for non -vertebral metastases. In 2011, ASTRO published a guideline providing recommendations for palliative radiotherapy as a treatment for bone metastases. ASTRO's recommendations were base d on the findings of their systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature on palliative RT for bone metastases combined with the expert opinion of the Task Force members. With regards to the most effective fractionation scheme for the treatment of painf ul and/or prevention of morbidity from peripheral bone metastases, the ASTRO task force indicated that: \"Multiple prospective randomized trials have shown pain relief equivalency for dosing schema, including 30 Gy in 10 fractions, 24 Gy in 6 fractions, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, and a single 8 -Gy fraction for patients with previously unirradiated painful bone met astases. Fractionated RT courses have been associated with an 8% repeat treatment rate to the same anatomic site because of recurrent pain vs. 20% after a single fraction; however, the single fraction treatment approach optimizes patient and caregiver conv enience.\" Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health. All rights reserved. 19 ASTRO recently published an update of their evidence -based guideline which reviewed 20 new randomized trials, 32 new prospective non -randomized trials and 4 meta -analyses. The literature continues to support the equivalent pain relief of a single 8 Gy treatment compared to multifraction therapy. Special circumstances have been suggested where more prolonged fractionation may be preferable. These include individuals with soft tissue involvement causing neuropathic symptoms, spinal metastases, impen ding or outright spinal cord compression, and presence of oligometastatic disease. Most of these trials exploring different radiation fractionation schemes for bony metastases have excluded subjects with spinal cord compression or pathologic fracture at pr esentation. The study by Roos et al. looked at single fraction vs fractionated radiotherapy for patients with neuropathic pain and found that the time to treatment failure was shorter in the single fraction regimen. The risk of developing spinal cord compr ession in patients with vertebral bony metastasis has been found to be slightly higher with single fraction treatment, although this did not reach statistical significance and the overall risk of cord compression was less than 6% in both groups. Recently p ublished results of the SCORAD randomized trial of 8 Gy single fraction treatment vs 20 Gy in five fractions in patients with spinal cord compression demonstrated that the single fraction treatment was non -inferior in terms of return to ambulatory status a nd survival. ASTRO indicated that while many of the peer -reviewed studies did not make a distinction between treatment relief for spinal vs non-spinal metastases, the task force was able to conclude that there was no evidence to suggest that a single 8 -Gy fraction was less effective in providing pain relief than a more prolonged RT course in painful spinal sites. The authors also concluded that there were not \"any suggestions from the available data that single -fraction therapy produces unacceptable rates of long -term side effects that might limit this fractionation schedule for patients with painful bone metastases.\" A recent report by Lam explores factors affecting adverse outcomes in 299 patients receiving palliative radiotherapy for uncomplicated spine metastases. The cumulative incidence of first skeletal adverse event (SAE) at 180 days was 23.6% for single fraction (SF) radiation vs 9.2% for multiple fraction (MF) treatment. On multivariate analysis, singe fraction treatment (HR 2.8 , P = .001) and base line spine instability score (HR 2.5 , P = .007) were significant predictors of the incidence of first SAE. To account for baseline differences, outcomes were compared using a propensity score matched analysis. They found that the 90 day incidence of SAEs w as 22% for patients treated with SF radiotherapy vs 6% for patients treated with a MF regimen (HR 3.9 , P = .003). Spinal adverse events were defined as a symptomatic fracture, hospitalization for site -related pain, salvage surgery, interventional procedure , new neurologi c symptoms or cord compression. Radiation therapy is a common treatment for metas tatic spinal cord compression. In patients with a single site of compression and life expectancy of at least 3 months, surgical decompression should be consider ed as it has been shown to preserve neurologic function better than radiotherapy alone in a phase III randomized study. Post-operative radiotherapy should be given in these patients. 30 Gy in 10 fractions has been the most commonly used. No reports have be en published regarding the use of single fraction palliative EBRT in the post-operative setting. For patients who are not candidates for surgery, radiation therapy should be given after initiation of corticosteroid therapy. A recent review of radiation the rapy for metastatic spinal cord compression concluded that for patients with a poor prognosis, a single fraction of 8 Gy should be given. For those with patients with a good prognosis, consideration of 30 Gy in 10 fractions was recommended. When a metastas is results in a pathologic compression fracture, percutaneous kyphoplasty may be of benefit. The ASTRO evidence based guideline concluded that no prospective data are available to suggest that the use of either kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty obviates the ne ed for EBRT in the management of painful bone metastases. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is being studied in the treatment of bony metastatic disease. Proposed indications for this modality include standalone or postoperative treatment in patients with progressive or recurrent disease following conventional external beam radiotherapy (cEBRT) and in the treatment of tumors traditionally considered radioresistant to cEBRT such as sarco ma, melanoma , and renal cell carcinoma. Several recent studies have not shown improvement in pain control compared to conventional radiation although the relief was more durable. A recent report from the phase 2, randomized VERTICAL trial looked at quality of life , functional interference and psychosocial aspects with either 8 Gy single fraction conventional radiotherapy or single fraction SBRT to a total of 18 Gy. Twelve weeks after treatment completion, treatment with conventional radiation improved funct ional interference significantly more than SBRT (25.5 vs 14.1 points, P = 0.04). Similarly, psychosocial aspects scores also improved more Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health. All rights reserved. 20 with conventional radiation (12.2 vs 7.3, P = 0.04). A similar trial published by Canadian and Australian investigators compared 20 Gy of conventional radiation delivered in 5 fractions with SBRT gi ven as 12 Gy times two. In comparing these regimens, the SBRT arm had significantly complete pain relief at 3 months compared to the lower dose fractionated conventional radiation (35% vs 14%, P < 0.0002). The updated ASTRO evidence - based guideline maintai ns that: \"Advanced RT techniques such as SBRT as the primary treatment for painful spine bone lesions or for spinal cord compression should be considered in the setting of a clinical trial or with data collected in a registry given that insufficient data a re available to routinely support this treatment currently.\" Repeat treatment Following initial treatment with radiation therapy for bony metastasis, some patients will develop recurrent or progressive symptoms for which additional radiation therapy is ind icated. Studies have shown repeat radiation therapy to be effective in reducing pain in approximately 48 % of patients. Responders have been shown to have improved quality of life. When a given site is re -treated, the effect of prior irradiation on the sur rounding normal tissues must be taken into account. This is especially important when treating vertebral lesions where to cumulative dose to the spinal cord must be minimized. The generally accepted maximum cumulative dose to the spinal cord is 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions (or equivalent) . If repeat radiation using 2D or 3D techniques would result in a cumulative dose to the spinal cord greater than 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions then consideration should be given to intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), stere otactic radiosurgery (SRS), or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Society Recommendations ASTRO - The 2013 Choosing Wisely campaign included as one of its 5 recommendations that fractionation beyond 10 treatments should not be routinely used to t reat bone metastases. They noted that 8 Gy in a single fraction results in equivalent pain relief compared to 20 Gy in 5 fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions. They suggested that strong consideration be given to 8 Gy in a single fraction for patient with poo r prognosis or transportation difficulties. ACR - The American College of Radiology has published Appropriateness Criteria for both spinal and non - spinal bone metastases. They note that radiation therapy is the mainstay of treatment for bony metastatic lesions. They list several fractionation regimens including 30 Gy in 10 fractions, 24 Gy in 6 fractions, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, or a single 8 Gy fraction. They note that randomized clinical trials have shown equivalent pain relief for all of these regimens.

When given after lumpectomy, WBI has been shown to result in equivalent survival when compared to mastectomy. When compared to lumpectomy alone, the addition of radiation therapy significantly reduces the risk of local recurrence and has even been shown to improve overall survival in some patients. Conventionally fractioned WBI usually consists of treatment to doses of 45 to 50 Gy in daily doses of 1.8 -2 Gy. Additional \"boost\" tre atment to the tumor bed has been shown to further decrease the risk of local recurrence in several randomized trials, especially in yo unger women and those with high -grade lesions. Adjuvant radiotherapy is an important component of treatment for du ctal car cinoma in situ (DCIS). Several large randomized controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the benefit of postoperative radiotherapy after excision of DCIS. These have shown a reduction in overall local recurrences and have also shown a decrease in the proportion of recurrences which are invasive. Except where otherwise noted, guidelines for breast cancer radiotherapy will also apply to patients with DCIS. In patients treated with mastectomy for invasive breast cancer, adjuvant radiation therapy has been show n to benefit patients with high -risk pathologic features including tumors greater than 5 cm, positive lymph nodes and when th e surgical margin is positive. Radiotherapy may also be considered in patients with a constellation of high-risk features inclu ding but not limited to tumor greater than 2 cm, extensive lymphovascular invas ion and close surgical margins. Treatment Planning For external beam WBI, 3D conformal planning techniques are commonly used to achieve a uniform dose distribution throughout the breast. Reasonable cosmesis can be achieved and toxicity can be limited using standard wedges, electronic compensation or forward planned field -in-field segments with custom blocking. Several randomized trials of \"simple IMRT\" for early stag e breast cancer have been reported and have shown a decrease in moist des quamation, overall cosmesis and telangiectasia when compared to 2D con ventionally wedged techniques. Of note, both of these studies employed field -in-field techniques to achieve homog eneity which do not meet the CPT definition for IMRT planning and delivery. There is evidence that radiation dose to the heart contributes to late cardiac toxicity in patients with left sided breast cancer. Gagliardi et al. have developed dose response mod el to predict the risk of cardiac mortality using data sets from several trials of radiotherapy for both Hodgkin's disease and breast cancer. They predict that using the most conservative model, when the volume of heart receiving 25 Gy is less than 10% tha t the risk cardiac mortality from radiation is less than 1% at 15 years. Whenever possible, care should be taken to exclude the heart fr om the primary radiation beam. Cardiac exposure can be limited through alternate patient positioning (such as the prone position) or through the use of deep ins piration breath hold technique. Limitations that would require inverse -planned IMRT or volumetric arc therapy should be rare. IMRT may be of benefit in highly selected cases where the anatomy is unfavorable or the ta rgets closely approximate the heart, however, the use of this technology has not demonstrated a significant clinical advantage in routine cases.

All rights reserved. 26 Radiation to the high axilla and supraclavicular region should be considered in cases where there are involved axillary lymph nodes. Treatment of the internal mammary node chain should be considered when those nodes are pathologically enlarged and/or PET avid on imaging studies. Inclusion of the internal mammary nodes in the treatment field may also be indicated wh en there are four or more positive axillary nodes or when the primary tumor is located in th e medial portion of the breast. Accelerated Whole Breast Irradiation (AWBI) There is a growing body of evidence that selected women with early stage breast c ancer a nd favorable anatomy are suitable candidates for accelerated w hole breast irradiation (AWBI). This approach has been studied in several randomized prospective clinical trials as well as a large meta -analysis. Included patients were mostly age 50 or greater , had tumors less than 4 cm, frequently did not receive chemotherapy, were generally node - negative and had a chest wall separation of < 25 cm. Patients were randomized to receive either 40 -42.5 Gy in 15-16 fractions or standard radiation consis ting of 50 G y in 25 fractions. With a median follow -up of 10 - 12 years, there were no significant differences seen in local control, disease -free survival or overall survival. The most recent report from the UK START trials as well as the meta -analysis have demonstrated that some hypofractionated regimens yielded improved cosmetic outcome including reduced incidence of breast shrinkage, telangiectasias and breast edema in the AWBI patients compared to standard fractionation. Additional benefits of AWBI includ e a decrease in the number of visits for daily treatment and a reduction in the overall cost of care. These results have prompted recommendations that AWBI should be favored for the endorsed cohort and considered for other selected patients. There is evide nce that administration of concurrent trastuzumab increases the risk of left ventricular dysfunction and it is unknown if this effect is more pronounced in patients treated with AWBI. For patients treated with prior chem otherapy, higher acute toxicity has been documented only in individuals whose radiotherapy began less than 20 days aft er chemotherapy was completed. In 2013, the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) included AWBI as one of its featured recommendations as part of the 2013 Choosing Wisely campaign. ASTRO recently published updated consensus criteria for who should be treated with AWBI to include all age groups, any stage as long as a separate nodal field is not used, and patients who have received chemotherapy. The dose inhomogeneity exclusion has also been restated to indicated that the volume of breast tissue receiving > 105% should be minimized re gardless of dose - fractionation. Ultrahypofractionated regimens have also been studied for whole breast irradiation. The FAST -Forward tria l compared 26 and 27 Gy treatments given over one week with moderately hypofractionated treatment of 40 Gy over 3 weeks. A total of 2,018 women with early stage breast cancer were randomized 1:1:1 to the three arms. The median follow -up was 71 months. Bot h one week treatments were non -inferior compared to 3 week WBI with local recurrence rates slightly lower than the 2.1% rate at 5 years seen with 3 week treatment. The higher dose 27 Gy arm showed worse cosmesis than the 40 Gy in 3 weeks arm while the 26 G y arm was not statistically different. Accelerated Partial Breast Irradia tion (APBI) Although the randomized clinical trials supporting radiotherapy have relied on whole breast irradiation, the majority of the benefit came from reducing recurrence in and i mmediately adjacent to the lumpectomy site. This observation has prompted investigation of whether local radiation, delivered only to the tumor bed and immediately adjacent tissue, could achieve similar results in selected patients. Accelerated partial bre ast irradiation (APBI) describes the treatment of the tumor bed alone with an accelerated treatment delivery schedule. Treatment can be given with brachytherapy delivered via implanted single or multilumen catheters, with external beam radiotherapy , or wit h intraoperative radiotherapy given at the time of surgery. A large cohort of patients who received APBI using the MammoSite applicator ha s been studied , and the 5 -year actuarial rate of ipsilateral bre ast tumor recurrence was 3.8%. More than 90% of patien ts in this study report ed good to excellent cosmesis. Long term high -quality data for APBI is currently lacking. Results from the prospective , randomized, phase III NSABP B -39/RTOG 0413 trial were recently reported. The study randomized patients to WBI or APBI delivered via brachytherapy or with 3D conformal techniques. The primary outcome was ipsilateral breast -tumor recurrence. With a median follow -up of 10.2 years, ipsilateral breast -tumor recurrence was 3% in the WBI group vs 4% for APBI . Survival and toxicities were similar. Although APBI did not meet the statistical criteria for equivalence to WBI and the overall difference in recurrence rate was 1%, t he authors conclude d that ABPI might be an acceptable alternative for so me women. In the RAPID trial comparing WBI with 3D conformal APBI, Canadian investigators found that 17% of WBI patients vs 29% of 3D conformal APBI patients had adverse cosmetic outcome s. In contrast, fewer adverse events were reported from women treated Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health.

The results of the APBI -IMRT Florence trial were recently reported. Eligible pa tients were over 40 and had tumors measuring 2.5 cm or less. A total of 520 patients were randomized to receive 50 Gy whole breast irradiation in 25 fractions or 30 Gy in 5 fractions using IMRT -based APBI. The 10 year ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence ra tes were 2.5% for WBI vs 3.7% for APB I (P = .4). The overall 10-year survival was similar in both arms at 92%. Of note, the APBI treatment was associated with lower acute toxicity and improved cosmesis compared to WBI ( P = .0001). A recent prospective, pha se III trial compared self -reported breast pain and cosmesis in patients randomized to either IMRT or 3D conformal bases APBI. Both groups were treated to 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions given twice daily. With 3 year follow -up, the IMRT treated patients reported significantly less pain at 2 years ( P = 0.002) and 3 years ( P = 0.045). There was no difference in cosmesis. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is aform of APBI in which the entire partial breast treatment is delivered at the time of lumpe ctomy. Several systems have been approved to deliver treatment with either electrons or 50 kV x-rays. Two large randomized trials of this approach have been published. The ELIOT trial compared elec tron- based IORT to WBI in women 48 years or older and tumors less than 2.5 cm. For all patients, the ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate was 4.4% for the IORT patients vs 0.4% for the WBI patients (P < .0001). A subsequent subset analysis looking only at patients who qualify as \"sui table\" for APBI using the ASTRO criteria revealed more favorable recurrence rates of 1.5% with electron IORT. Results of the TARGIT -A trial were recently updated and with a shorter median follow -up of 29 months , they reported a local recurrence rate of 3.3% for IORT vs 1.3% for WBI. When only the patients treated at the time of lumpectomy are considered, the local recurrence rates were 2.1% for IORT vs 1.1% for WBI. In these patients, if high -risk features such as positive margins, extensive intraductal com ponent, lobular histology, high -grade histology, lymphovascular invasion or positive nodes were present on the final pathology, WBI was often added to the treatment. Survival was similar in both arms. A meta -analysis comparing the oncologic efficacy of IOR T with WBI was recently published by He et al. A total of 38 studies were reviewed. Relapse -free survival with IORT was 96.6% compared to 98% with whole breast irradiation. Distant metastasis free survival and overall survival were not significantly differ ent between the two cohorts. It is recommended that individuals considering APBI as an alternative to whole breast irradiation be counseled that whole breast irradiation is the more well -established treatment with documented long -term effectiveness and saf ety, and that treatment with APBI may be associated with an increased risk of local recurrence and need for mastectomy. Society recommendations regarding patient suitability have been published, but are not all in agreement. Regarding electronic brachyther apy, the American Brachytherapy Society states that \"it is not recommended that electronic brachytherapy be utilized for accelerated partial breast irradiation, non -melanomatous skin cancers, or vaginal cuff brachytherapy outside prospective clinical trial s at this time. \" Society Recommendations for AWBI ASTRO - An update to the 2011 Guideline was published in early 2018. The new recommendations support the use of AWBI for all ages, all stages when nodes will not be treated separately, and in patients who h ave received any type chemotherapy. The consensus was that when a boost is not given, a dose of 40 Gy in 15 fractions or 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions is favored. In homogeneity greater that 107% in the central axis is no longer an exclusion. The panel recommend ed that the volume of tissue receiving >105% should be minimized irrespective of dose schedule. Society Recommendations for APBI The National Comprehensive Cancer Network \u00ae (NCCN, 20 20) - Guideline indicates that preliminary studies have shown that APBI may result in similar rates of local control in early breast cancer compared to WBI. They also note that cosmesis may be infe rior and follow -up is limited. NCCN recommends treatment with APBI to be provided in a prospective clinical trial when possible. If AP BI is provided off trial, then brachytherapy is Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health. All rights reserved. 28 recommended for those with a low risk of recurrence. They cite the ASTRO criteria for suitable candidates for APBI. ASTRO - An update to the Evidence -Based Consensus statement was published in 2017. There wer e several changes in the criteria for who are \"s uitable\" candidates for APBI. The age for the suitable group was lowered to 50 or older. The criteria were also broadened to include ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The criteria are summarized below: Age > 50 years Surgical margins > 2 mm for invasive ductal cancer and > 3 mm for DCIS Size < 2 cm for invasive ductal cancer and < 2.5 cm for DCIS DCIS must be low to intermediate grade and non -palpable No lymphovascular invasion ER positive No invasive lobular cancer American College of Breast Surgeons - The American Society of Breast Surgeons recommends the following selection criteria when considering patients for treatment with APBI, as a sole form of radiation therapy in lieu of whole breast irradiation: Age 45 years old or older for invasive cancer and age 50 years or older for DCIS Invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ Total tumor size (invasive and DCIS) less than or equal to 3 cm in size Negative microscopic surgical margins of excision Sentinel lymph node negative Clinical Indications 2D or 3D Conformal is appropriate for breast cancer when ANY of the following conditions are met: As an adjunct to surgical treatment after lumpectomy for localized breast cancer or DCIS As an adjunct to surgical treatment after mastectomy for locally adv anced breast cancer To treat recurrent disease Palliative treatment of metastatic disease, including symptomatic breast or chest wall disease Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) is appropriate for breast cancer when ANY of the following condition s are met: For individuals with left -sided breast lesions where the risk of cardiac exposure would be excessive with 3D conformal treatment and when ALL of the following are met : o 3D planning has been done, with appropriate techniques to limit toxicity o Desp ite the use of all appropriate techniques, the dose -volume constraints would lead to unacceptable risk of cardiac toxicity (EITHER constraint below is exceeded ): More than 10% of the heart would receive 25 Gy or more (V25 > 10%) More than 10% of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery would receive 15 Gy (V15 > 10%) o IMRT plan demonstrates improvement to tissue exposure to within safe ranges Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health.

Patients with brain metastasis have a poor prognosis, with a median survival of 2 to 3 months when treated with steroids alone. The addition of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) generally extents median survival to 3 to 6 months. Individual results vary significantly based on the number of metastatic lesions , the performance status of the patient and the extent of extracranial disease. In recent years, there has been a trend away from the use of WBRT in patients with limited disease who are candidates for surgery or radiosurgery in order to minimize the neuro cognitive complications of WBRT. Whole brain radiation therapy with standard 2D or 3D conformal radiation therapy is recommended for individuals with multiple brain metastases (greater than 4 treated in a given session), and should also be considered in in dividuals with brain metastases and any of the following: ECOG performance status greater than 2, presence of progressive and symptomatic visceral disease, or metastases significantly progressing after multiple treatment options. The RTOG has studied sever al different fractionation schedules for WBRT and prolonged fractionation schedules did not improve outcomes compared to 30 Gy in 10 fractions. A 2019 evidence -based review by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons on the role of whole brain radiotherapy re commends a dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions to improve progression -free survival in patients with more than four metastases. To minimize the neurocognitive toxicity, local therapy in the form of surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery is recommended for patient s with four or fewer accessible lesions. When WBRT is used, 6 months of memantine therapy should be offered to potentially delay, lessen or prevent the associated neurologic toxicity. Results from the phase III NRG CC001 trial have recently been reported. There were 518 patients randomized to either hippocampal avoidance (HA -WBRT) or whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Both groups were treated with memantine. The HA -WBRT treated patients were found to have a lower risk of cognitive failure compared to standard WBRT (HR 0.74 , P = .02) attributable to preservation of executive function, learning , and memory. There were no differences in OS, intracranial PFS or toxicity. Historically, surgical resection has been performed in patients with solitary metastasis in accessible locations. Postoperative WBRT has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrence in a randomized trial. For brain metastases greater than 4 cm in diameter or causing mass effect, surgery is preferred over stereotactic radiosurgery. In 2022, a co mbined practice guideline on treatment of brain metastases was published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the Society for Neuro -Oncology (SNO) and the American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO). They recommend that SRS should be off ered to patients with 4 or fewer metastatic lesions. They also recommend postoperative SRS for patients with 1 or 2 resected metastatic Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health. All rights reserved. 37 lesions. Patients with more lesions are recommended to receive whole brain irradiation unless they have poor KPS perform ance status of less than 50. External beam radiation treatment is a common treatment for primary brain tumors as either definitive or adjuvant therapy after resection. For high -grade gliomas, concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy is generally recommended as it has been shown to increase survival compared to radiotherapy alone. In 2016, ASTRO published an evidence -based clinical practice guideline on radiation therapy for glioblastoma. For patients with reasonable performance status up to age 70, a dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions should be given. For elderly patients, hypofractionated treatment such as 40 Gy in 15 fractions gives similar results. IMRT may provide better coverage for primary brain lesions, with decreased exposure of normal brain tissue. IMRT is recommended when a lesion is in close proximity to a critical or sensitive structure and 3D conformal radiation would result in unsafe exposure to these structures. The use of IMRT for hippocampal sparing is under active investigation and should only be use d in the context of a clinical trial. IMRT is considered medically necessary in any case of repeat irradiation of overlapping or bordering treatment fields. SRS has an excellent safety profile for many clinical situations when targets are localized, and it has applications for both benign and malignant lesions. It also often represents an alternative to surgical intervention when patients are not optimal surgical candidates. SRS has been extensively studied in the treatment of limited brain metastases. Cont rol rates of approximately 90% are reported. Although recurrence elsewhere in the brain is common, the addition of WBRT to SRS does not improve survival. This has led to the ASTRO Choosing Wisely recommendation not to routinely add WBRT to SRS for limited brain metastasis. SRS is not recommended for the treatment of CNS lymphoma. Stereotactic boost for high -grade gliomas has been studied in several randomized controlled clinical trials. RTOG 93 -05 randomized patients with glioblastoma multiforme to upfront SRS followed by conventional radiotherapy and carmustine to the same treatment without SRS. With a median follow -up of 61 months, there was no difference in survival, pattern of failure or quality of life in the two groups. RTOG 0023 studied the use of a stereotactic conformal boost for supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme. In this study, four weekly stereotactic boost treatments were delivered to give a cumulative dose of 70 -78 Gy to the postoperative enhancing tumor. There was no difference in survival compared to historical controls. Based on these studies, SRS or SBRT are considered investigational for the primary treatment of grade 3 -4 gliomas. For certain benign CNS abnormalities, SRS has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment. Soon after t he development of the Gamma Knife by Leksell in the 1970s, it was studied for the treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVM) where is has been shown to have an 80% obliteration rate. Based on this proof of concept, SRS has subsequently been shown to be an effective alternative to surgery for a wide variety of benign lesions including ocular melanoma, retinoblastoma, schwannoma, craniopharyngioma, pineal lesions for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia is medically necessary i n cases ref ractory to medical management. SRS for the treatment of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders is listed as \"insufficient evidence\" in an evidence -based review by the American Academy of Neurology and therefore remains invest igational at this time. SRS is given as a single fraction. Cranial stereotactic treatment given in 2 -5 fractions is billed as SBRT.

They are almost always squamous cell carcinomas and are frequently associated with HPV infection. Because of the lymphatic drainage of this area, the inguinal lymph nodes are at risk and are commonly inv olved when lesions involve the area below the dentate line. Although these cancers have been treated with abdominoperineal resection in the past, the current standard of care is concomitant chemoradiotherapy with a fluoropyrimidine and either mitomycin or cisplatin. Doses of 45 Gy are given for early stage tumors. More advanced and node positive cancers are treated to doses of 54 -59.4 Gy. IMRT techniques, which can reduce the toxicity associated with radiation, are preferred over 3D conformal techniques f or the treatment of anal cancer and cancers of the anal canal. The radiation field includes the pelvis, the anus, the perineum, and the inguinal lymph nodes. Definitive treatment of anal cancers typically involves concurrent radiation and chemotherapy. Palliative radiation with 3D conformal techniques is recommended for metastatic disease or to enhance local control of a symptomatic bulky primary. Rectal Cancer Colorectal cancer is much more common than anal cancer and is the second most common cause of cance r death. Rectal cancers, which occur below the peritoneal reflection, benefit from radiation therapy which has been shown to reduce local recurrence and improve survival. Radiation is generally given with 5 -fluorouricil or capecitabine chemotherapy. Pre operative chemoradiation is preferable because it is better tolerated and improves the chance of sphincter sparing surgery in marginally resectable patients. Precision techniques like 3D conformal radiotherapy and IMRT have been shown to reduce the dose to bowel and minimize side effects. The radiation field should include the presacral nodes, internal iliac nodes, and external iliac nodes for T4 tumors. Typically, 45 Gy is given to the initial field with an additional 5.4 - 9 Gy being given to a cone down boost field. Short -course preoperative radiotherapy to a dose of 25 Gy is another alternative. Colon Cancer Radiation is not a standard part of local treatment for colon cancer, but is incorporated into tr eatment for selected patients. It is generally used in situations where there is an elevated risk of local recurrence due to local invasion of the surrounding tissues. 3D conformal radiation is the standard option, and IMRT is reserved for repeat irradiation of previously treated patients. Stereotactic rad iation techniques have been considered in highly selected cases of limited hepatic metastases; however, surgical rese ction is the standard of care. Please see the section on hepatobiliary cancers for more guidance on the treatment of liver metastases. For review of metastatic sites, please refer to specific guidelines for the appropriate location (e.g., CNS Cancers for brain metastases, Lung Cancer for lung metastases).

Squamous cancers a re more common in the cervical and mid -thoracic esophagus while adenocarcinomas are more common in the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. The latter are more common in Western countries and are associated with gastroesophageal reflux and Barre tt's esophagus. Radiation therapy is a common part of the multidisciplinary treatment of esophageal can cers. Radiation can be used pre operatively, post-operatively, as primary therapy in conjunction with chemotherapy or as a palliative modality to improve swallowing. Long -term results of the CROSS randomized controlled trial of neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery showed improved survival compared to surgery alone. Radiation in that study was given with 3D conformal techniques. IMRT is still under active investigation for treatment of esophageal cancer. Retrospective comparisons have not demonstrated improved survival but have shown a decrease in grade 3 toxicities such as hospitalization, feeding tube placement and greater than 20% weight loss. IM RT should only be used in curative cases. Gastric Cancer Gastric cancer is relatively uncommon in the U .S. but is a common cause of cancer and cancer mortality worldwide. It is associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, smoking and heavy drinking. Gas tric cancer frequently presents at an advanced stage. Chemoradiation has an established role in the adjuvant treatment of resected tumors based on the results of intergroup study 0116. Patients in that randomized study who received chemoradiation had impro ved survival compared to patients treated with surgery alone. Use of 3D treatment planning is recommended. Treatment recommendations depend on the location of the bulk of the tumor, location and lymph node involvement. In addition to adjuvant post -operativ e treatment, radiation is used in a variety of clinical situations, including preoperative treatment, in combination with chemotherapy, and as a palliative therapy. Significant supportive care is required during a full course of treatment. No prospective studies of IMRT in gastric cancer have been published. Several institutions have noted improved dose distribution and better organ sparing with IMRT for stomach cancer. No survival advantage with IMRT has been reported. Hepatobiliary Cancer Hepatocellular c intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are relatively rare but lethal cancers of the liver and bile ducts. HCC is commonly associated with cirrhosis due to hepatitis and other factors. Although t here are no prospective data on the use of IMRT for the treatment of these cancers, the liver is very sensitive to radiation therapy . IMRT may have a limited role in the treatment of HCC and cholangiocarcinoma when 3D conformal therapy would result in unac ceptable toxicity due to exposure Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health.

This technology remains under active investigation in many clinical situations, and more data is needed to clarify the role of SBRT. Patients should first be evaluated for potential curative therapy, as resection, studies have recently reported improved local control and PFS with SBRT versus treatment with RFA. Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) is also known as radioembolization. This technique targets the delivery of small beads or microspheres containing yttrium -90 to the tumor. It is used for palliation of liver tumors, and is sometimes used as a bridge to liver transplantation. Liver Metastases Metastatic involvement of the liver can occur with many cancer types, especially in gastrointestinal malignancies. For limited disease, treatment options include surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and SBRT. There is also a role for palliative radiotherapy in more advanced disease. The use of stereotactic techniques to treat liver metasta ses is the subject of clinical trials. There are no randomized comparisons between RFA and SBRT. A single institution retrospective comparison of RFA (112 patients) with SBRT (170 patients) looked at freedom from local progression (FFLP). The median follow -up was 24.6 months. For tumors less than 2 cm, the two year FFLP rate was 88.2% with SBRT vs 73.9% with RFA ( P = .06). For lesions equal or greater than 2 cm, treatement with SBRT showed improved FFLP compared to RFA with a hazard ratio of 0.21 (P = .005) . Survival and toxicity were similar. The authors concluded for tumors less than 2 cm both SBRT and RFA yield equivalent control but that for tumors 2 cm or greater SBRT is preferred over RFA. Pancreatic Cancer For the treatment of pancreatic cancer, radiation is recommended in the setting of unresectable or borderline resectable disease (neoadjuvant or definitive), adjuvant treatment after surgery, and palliation of symptoms. Outside of palliative care, radiation is traditionally administered concurrently with chemotherapy. There is no clear standard for neoadjuvant therapy, and multiple chemoradiotherapy options are available. 3D conformal radiation techniques are considered standard. A recent systematic review by Bittner compares outcomes an d toxicity in patients treated with IMRT and 3D conformal radiotherapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. There were no apparent differences in overall or progression -free survival. Both nausea/vomiting and diarrhea were statistically lower with IMRT compared to 3D conformal, although the differences were modest (7.8% vs 13% and 2% vs 11.6% , respectively ; P < .001 for both). Long -term grade 3 or greater GI toxicity was 5% with IMRT vs 10.6% with 3D ( P = .017). Given the lack of improved outcomes, IMRT should o nly be used in curative cases where 3D conformal planning would result in unacceptable doses to surrounding normal tissues. Care should be taken to adhere to recommended target coverage and dose specifications as radiation quality has been shown to impact survival in several studies. Initial experience with single fraction SBRT for unresectable pancreatic cancer resulted in favorable local control rates but high rates of late gastrointestinal complications. Subsequent studies using fractionated SBRT have shown lower rates of late toxicity. A recent retrospective review of locally advanced pancreatic cancer cases in the National Cancer Database (NCDB) compared outcomes between 7,819 patients treated with conventional radiation with outcomes in 631 patients t reated with SBRT. Two year overall survival was 16.3% with conventional radiation vs 20.3% in pati ents treated with SBRT (P < .001). This benefit was maintained in the propensity matched analysis. Another retrospective study compared outcomes in the NCDB b etween chemo alone, chemo plus EBRT, chemo plus IMRT and chemo plus SBRT. Median overall survival results were 9.9 months, 10.9 months, 12 months and 13.9 months , respectively. For the match propensity cohort, overall survival was superior with SBRT vs che motherapy alone ( P < .018). A recent systematic review and meta - analysis comparing conventional radiation with SBRT confirms these findings. The SBRT treated patients had a 2-year overall survival of 26.9% compared to 13.7% with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Acute toxicity was significantly lower for SBRT and late toxicity was equivalent. SBRT is considered medically necessary for the treatment of locally advanced, non -metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

About two -thirds of these do not invade the muscle layer at the time of diagnosis and are tre ated with transuretheral resection (TURBT) with or without instillation of intravesicle adjuvant therapy such as BCG, mitomycin or gemcitabine. Muscle invasive cancer requires more aggressive treatment. The standard of care is radical cystectomy. Postop erative radiotherapy is indicated for T3 or T4 tumors and when there is involvement of the pelvic lymphatics. Bladder preservation therapy with concurrent chemoradiotherapy is an alternative for highly motivated patients after maximal TURBT and results in 60-80% rates of functional bladder sparing. In the palliative setting, radiation alone is an effective treatment for hematuria. For definitive therapy, it is recommended to treat the whole bladder to 40 -45 Gy followed by a boost to the bladder tumor to a total dose up to 66 Gy excluding, if possible, normal areas of the bladder from the boost volume. When high doses of radiotherapy are given, IMRT is often indicated to minimize the dose to pelvic organs at risk, especially the small bowel. Penile Cancer Penile cancer is rare and requires multidisciplinary management. Brachytherapy is the preferred approach in selected cases of early stage penile cancers. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy as primary treatment, or after surgery is recommended for larger tumors and when there is nodal involvement. Radiation may also be used when surgical margins are positive. Testicular Cancer Following inguinal orchiectomy for early stage pure seminoma, there is an approximately 15% risk of recurrence in the para - aortic lymph node s. External beam radiation significantly reduces this risk and is an option to surveillance or single agent ch emotherapy in stage I disease. Radiation to the para -aortic and ipsilateral iliac nodes is an alternative to chemotherapy in individuals with stag e IIA and IIB disease. IMRT is not recommended for treatment of pure testicular seminomas due to the low doses given and the increased risk of secondary malignancy in the kidney, liver, or bowel with IMRT. Radiation is not a standard component in the treat ment of non-seminomatous testicular cancer. For review of metastatic sites, please refer to specific guidelines for the appropriate location (e.g., Central Nervous Sys tem Cancers for brain metastases, Lung Cancer for lung metastases).

External beam radiation is used in many clinical situations to treat pelvic tissues and regional lymph nodes. With significant t oxicity constraints, particularly gastrointestinal and urologic toxicity, IMRT is often the recommended modality. IMRT is not routinely recommended for palliative treatment of symptoms in the setting of advanced disease. Cervical Cancer In the U .S., cervical cancer is relatively uncommon. About 80% of cases are squamous cell carcinoma. Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is known to increase the risk of cervical cancer and this had led to development of a vaccine to prevent the disease. Early stage cervical cancer can be treated with either surgery or radiation. More advanced disease is treated with concurr ent chemoradiotherapy followed by brachytherapy. If high risk features are found at the time of surgery, adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy is indicated. IMRT is helpful in minimizing radiation dosage to the critical structures in the pelvis, particularly the bowel. Compared to 3D conformal radiotherapy, IMRT has been shown to reduce the incidence of acute and chronic gastrointestinal side effects and also lower the risk of bowel obstruction. External beam radiation techniques should not be considered alte rnatives to brachytherapy for an intact cervix. Brachytherapy is commonly incorporated into the definitive management of cervical cancer. For treatment of the intact cervix, tandem and ovoid or tandem and ring applicators are most often used. For more adva nced cases, interstitial implants may be required. Brachytherapy can be delivered with either low dose rate (LDR) or high dose rate (HDR) techniques. When LDR brachytherapy is used, two applications are typically performed. For HDR treatment, up to six fr actions are appropriate. Brachytherapy can be used alone for very early stage cervical cancer. More commonly, brachytherapy is used as a boost following external beam radiotherapy. When tumors are not adequately dosed with brachytherapy, completion hystere ctomy may be of benefit. Concurrent platinum based chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival compared to radiotherapy alone for early stage high -risk disease as well as advanced stage disease. Chemoradiotherapy has been shown to be more effective tha n radiotherapy alone in the adjuvant setting in intermediate and high -risk patients but with increased toxicity . Uterine Neoplasms Endometrial cancers arise in the uterine lining and commonly present as post -menopausal bleeding. They are more common than c ervical cancer with approximately 55,000 cases per year. The primary treatment for endometrial cancer is surgery. Primary radiation can be used in patients who are not surgical candidates. Adjuvant radiation therapy has been shown to decrease recurrences i n women at risk. Risk factors for recurrence include age, depth of myometrial invasion, tumor grade and presence of lymphovascular invasion. Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health. All rights reserved. 63 Most recurrences are in the vaginal cuff. External beam radiation therapy targets any gross disease present, the parametrial regions, upper vaginal and paravaginal tissues, as well as pelvic lymph nodes (lower common iliac, external iliac, internal iliac, presacral). IMRT techniques reduce the radiation dose to nearby critical pelvic structures, such as small bowel. The use of IMRT was associated with a significant decrease in grade 3 late effects and other adverse events in both the PARCER and PORTEC -3 studies comparing IMRT to 3 - dimensional conformal radiotherapy. External pelvic radiotherapy is the preferred treatme nt for stage IB grade 3 lesions and patients with involved nodes. A brachytherapy boost is appropriate for patients with endocervical or cervical stromal involvement. Whether external radiotherapy can be replaced by vaginal brachytherapy and chemotherapy for high risk stage I and stage II patients is currently being studied by the GOG. Vaginal brachytherapy alone is preferred for most other stage I patients based on the results of the PORTEC -2 randomized trial, although EBRT may be reasonable for those at especially high risk of LRR. As advocated in the 2014 Choosing Wisely campaign, stage IA patients with grade 1 or 2 disease and no other risk factors should be observed. Regarding electronic brachytherapy, the American Brachytherapy Society states that \"it is not recommended that electronic brachytherapy be utilized for accelerated partial breast irradiation, non -melanomatous skin cancers, or vaginal cuff brachytherapy outside prospective clinical trials at this time.\" Uterine sarcomas are rare tumors arisi ng in muscle or connective tissue. Postoperative radiation therapy is recommended for patients at high risk for pelvic recurrence after surgery. As with other gynecologic cancers, IMRT may be used to reduce the dose to the small bowel. Ovarian Cancer Radia tion therapy is no longer a common component of initial treatment or consolidative therapy for primary epithelial ovarian cancer treatment. Standard of care includes surgical resection or debulking and systemic chemotherapy. Palliative radiation remains an option to manage symptoms in recurrent or metastatic disease. For review of metastatic sites, please refer to specific guidelines for the appropriate location (e.g., Central Nervous System Cancers for brain metastases and Lung Cancer for lung metastases).

IMRT has demonstrated improvement for Head and Neck cancer irradiation by reducing long -term side effects in the oropharyngeal, paranasal sinus, and nasopharyngeal cancers by reducing the dose to saliv ary glands, temporal lobes, auditory and optic structures. The use of IMRT to other regions has similar benefits and may be administered at the discretion of the ordering physician. However, the use of IMRT for early stage (stages I, II) glottic cancer has not been well established. Definitive or consolidative radiation for head and neck lymphomas often includes similar anatomic targets the other head and neck malignancies and IMRT may be considered medically necessary to spare salivary function and prevent permanent xerostomia. Differentiated thyroid cancers are most often treated with surgical resection, with or without radioactive iodine (RAI). External beam radiation is used in a variety of clinical situations, including inadequate RAI uptake, unresectab le or incompletely resected disease, locoregional recurrence, and metastatic disease. Anaplastic thyroid cancer represents a highly lethal malignancy, with no clearly effective treatment protocols. External beam radiation, with or without chemotherapy, ma y improve short -term survival, and can be used to palliate symptoms, particularly airway obstruction.

For non -small cell lung cancer, radiation may be used as an adjunct to surgery. It may also serve as definitive therapy in unresectable disease. For unresectable stage II and III disease, concurrent chemoradiotherapy is considered standard of care, when tolerated. 3D conformal radiation typically provides optimal coverage of tumor volumes. IMRT may improve dose -volume constraints, but at the expense of increasing the volume of norm al tissue expo sed to low doses of radiation. If normal tissue tolerances would be exceeded with 3D conformal planning, IMRT is considered medically necessary. The optimal dose and fractionation for both definitive and palliative treatment of non -small cell lung cancer has been the subject of numerous clinical investigations. Based on several earlier phase I/II trials of dose escalation, RTOG 0617 compared standard Gy) with conformal radiotherapy given concurrently with carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy with and without the addition of cetuximab. There was no benefit from the use of cetuximab in either arm. Overall survival was better in the standard -dose arms (28.7 vs 20.3 mos, P < .004). Standard -dose radiotherapy also resu lted in better median progression -free survival (11.8 vs 9.8 mos), lower risk of severe esophagitis (7% vs 21% ; P < .0001) and fewer treatment -related deaths. ASTRO recently published an evidence -based clinical practice guideline which concluded that the i deal external beam dose fractionation for curative intent chemoradiotherapy for non -small cell lung cancer is 60 Gy given in 2 Gy once daily fractions over 6 weeks. Dose escalation beyond 60 Gy was not recommended outside the setting of clinical trial. Thi s guideline has also been endorsed by ASCO. When used without concurrent chemotherapy, the guideline recommends a minimum dose of 60 Gy. In metastatic NSCLC where palliative treatment is being considered, the goal is to strike a balance between symptom rel ief, local control and treatment toxicity. ASTRO published a comprehensive evidence -based guideline on palliative radiotherapy in lung cancer. The guideline concluded that higher -dose/fractionation regimens (30 -Gy/10 -fraction or higher) may benefit patient s with good performance status. These higher dose regimens are associated with significant adverse effects such as esophagitis. Shorter course treatment is recommended for patients with poor performance status. Despite this recommendation, Koshy et al. fou nd that almost half of stage IV lung cancer patients received inappropriately high doses of radiation (defined as more than 15 fractions). A recent update of the ASTRO guideline now supports concurrent chemoradiotherapy with a platinum doublet in stage III patients with ECOG performance status of 0 -2 and a life expectancy of at least 3 months. Stereotactic radiation may be used as definitive therapy in earlier stages of disease for patients who may not be candidates for invasive surgery. Even for operable patients, stereotactic radiation has been shown to be non - inferior to video -assisted thorascopic resections with mediastinal lymph node dissections (VATS L -MLND). Chang et al. reported a 3-year overall survival rate of 91% with SBRT which was the same OS rate reported with VATS L -MLND. S tereotactic radiation may also be recommended for local palliation or prevention of symptoms such as hemoptysis, obstruction, or pain. There is an emerging role for SBRT to treat oligometastatic disease (3 or fewer metastati c lesions). Please refer to the Oligometastatic Disease section for further discussion. Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health. All rights reserved. 75 Radiation therapy is also used in all stages of small cell lung cancer, either as definitive treatment in combination with chemotherapy, or as palliative therapy. Concu rrent chemotherapy is preferred to sequential chemotherapy with RT. Target vo lumes are best defined with pre treatment PET/CT obtained at the time of radiotherapy planning. Consolidative thoracic radiation may be beneficial to select patients with extensive stage disease who have significant responses to standard chemotherapy. Hyperfractionated radiation given twice daily has been shown to improve survival compared to conventionally fractionated treatment. ASTRO has published a clinical guideline on the use of radiation therapy to treat small cell lung cancer. In that guideline, there is a strong recommendation based on moderate quality evidence that inoperable patients with stage I or node negative stage II disease can be treated with either SBRT or conventi onally fractionated radiotherapy. The utility of 2D radiation is likely limited to palliative treatment of metastatic disease. The minimum standard used to treat intrapulmonary lesions is 3D conformal, with CT planning. PET/CT is noted to significantly imp rove targeting accuracy. Tumor motion should be accounted for. The clinically appropriate use of more advanced modalities, such as IMRT and SBRT, are limited to specific clinical scenarios. It is the responsibility of the Radiation practice to create optim al treatment plans when evaluating modality choices for treatment. For review of metastatic sites, please refer to specific guideline section for the appropriate location (e.g., Central Nervous System Cancers for brain metastases and Lung Cancer for lung m etastases).

The disease commonly affects lymph nodes in the mediastinum but can affect nodes and other lymphatic organs throughout the body. Occasionally, the bone marrow and liver are also involved. Pathologically, Hodgkin lymphoma is characterized by the presence of characteristic lymphocytes called Reed -Sternberg cells. There are four di stinct subtypes of Hodgkin lymphoma. About 80% of cases are termed nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma. The other types include lymphocyte -predominant, mixed cellularity and lymphocyte - depleted Hodgkin lymphoma. Over the years, treatment has evolved from ra diotherapy or chemotherapy alone to a risk adapted approach of chemotherapy and involved site radiotherapy. Treatment intensity is also guided by treatment response on PET scan performed after multiple cycles of chemotherapy. For favorable stage I and II d isease, 20 -30 Gy of involved site radiotherapy is given after chemotherapy. For bulky disease at presentation, doses of 30 -36 Gy are appropriate. Although these doses are generally below the dose tolerance of the surrounding normal tissues, there are situa tions where advanced planning techniques are likely to result in a meaningful decrease in late toxicity from radiotherapy. Koeck et al. published a planning comparison of 3D vs IMRT for patients with unfavorable mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma and found reduc ed mean heart and spinal cord doses with IMRT. Doses to the lungs and breasts were higher with 3D conformal radiation. The most pronounced benefits were seen in patients with lymph nodes anterior to the heart. Since IMRT has been shown to increase low dose exposure to the breasts and lungs, the potential benefit of cardiac sparing needs to be weighed against increased risks of breast and lung cancer, especially in female patients. The role of IMRT in the treatment of non -mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma has not been studied and therefore IMRT in these cases is considered not medically necessary. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a cancer arising in lymphocytes and includes all subtypes except Hodgkin lymphoma (described below). The disease most commonly involved B -cells but can involve other types of lymphocytes. Historically, lymphomas have been grouped based on histology into low grade, intermediate grade and high grade. Advances in tumor phenotyping has allowed more sophisticated subtyping t o guide treatment. Specific treatment depends on the grade and extent of disease. Treatments may include chemotherapy, immunotherapy or other targeted therapy, radiation therapy and stem cell transplantation. Some asymptomatic follicular (low grade) lymph omas may not require active treatment. In other cases, involved site radiotherapy alone or in combination with systemic therapy is used. Doses range from 20 -36 Gy. Stage I and II diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is typically treated with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The dose to the involved site is guided by the response to 3 -6 cycles of R -CHOP chemotherapy. Doses of 30 -36 Gy are given to consolidate complete responses while doses of 40 -50 Gy are used to treat partial responses. Radiotherapy is also applied to bulky sites of involvement after chemotherapy in stage III and IV lymphoma. Lymphoma Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health. All rights reserved. 83 including mucosal associated (MALT) lymphomas, mantle cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma and others may involve radiotherapy with doses up to 45 Gy as part of t he treatment. Because the doses of radiation needed for non -Hodgkin lymphoma are lower than doses used for most other types of cancer, the need for advanced planning techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is limited. As with Hodgki n lymphoma, IMRT is appropriate for mediastinal disease and head and neck presentations due to the proximity of the target to sensitive normal structures. For other sites there are limited data regarding IMRT ; therefore , it is considered not medically nece ssary.

While widespread metas tatic disease is generally considered incurable, there exists a subset of patients with limited metastatic involvement who can potentially be cured of their disease. This state has been termed \"oligometastatic\" and is most commonly defined as having 3 or f ewer metastatic lesions. In the past, aggressive metastasis -directed therapy largely consisted of surgical resection of lung and liver lesions. Radiotherapy was generally reserved for palliation of symptoms. Advances in system therapy and the widespread av ailability of stereotactic body radiation therapy have renewed interest in ablative therapy for oligometastatic disease. Much of the data on treatment of oligometastatic cancer consist of single inst itution retrospective reviews. Several series have shown long-term benefit from resection of limited liver metastases in patients with colorectal cancer. Five -year disease -free survival rates approach 30% in this setting. Similarly, radiofrequency ablation of limited hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer ha s been shown to improve survival. A phase II randomized EORTC trial studied the addition of radiofrequency ablation to standard systemic therapy in 119 patients without extrahepatic disease. Ruers et al. recently reported an 8 -year overall survival rate of 36% for patients randomized to radiofrequency ablation of liver lesions compared to 9% for patients receiving systemic therapy alone. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), also termed stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR), has also been stu died in the treatment of oligometastatic cancer. Control rates with this ablative technology approach 90%. Several prospective phase II studies have examined the potential benefit of SABR in oligometastatic disease. Gomez et al. reported results of a multi -institutional phase II randomized study of local consolidative therapy (LCT) vs maintenance therapy or observation. Patients with non -small cell lung cancer and 1 -3 metastatic lesions were eligible for randomization only if disease had not progressed on c hemotherapy. The study was stopped early due to a significant improvement in progression -free survival with LCT (11.9 months) vs maintenance only (3.9 mos) yielding a hazard ratio of 0.35 ( P < .005). Iyengar et al. studied whether consolidative radiothera py to the primary and up to 5 metastatic lesions would improve disease -free survival in NSCLC compared to m aintenance chemotherapy alone. Twenty -nine patients were randomized. Disease -free survival in SABR -treated patients was 9.7 months compared to 3.5 m onths in the maintenance group ( P < .01). In a single -arm phase II study of SABR in 147 patients with up to 5 metastatic lesions, Sutera et al. report a 5 - year overall survival rate of 43%. In addition to lung cancer, they treated colorectal, head and neck , breast, and prostate cancers among others. Although they allowed up to 5 metastatic lesions, 96.5% of patients had 3 or fewer lesions. On multivariate analysis, patients with a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of 80 or less was associated with worse su rvival. The phase II STOMP trial randomized men with castration -sensitive, oligometastatic prostate cancer recurrence to either ablative metastasis -directed therapy (MDT) or surveillance. There were 62 patients studied using androgen deprivation therapy (A DT)-free survival as the primary endpoint. Up to 3 metastatic lesions were allowed in either nodal or non -nodal sites and MDT in cluded either surgery or SABR. At a median follow -up of 3 years, MDT resulted in a median ADT -free survival of 21 months vs 13 m onths with surveillance (HR 0.6, P = .11). Quality of life was similar in both groups at baseline, 3 months, and one year. Long -term results of the SABR -COMET (NCT01446744) trial were recently reported. This randomized trial compared overall survival in pa tients with a controlled primary cancer and up to 5 metastatic lesions treated with either SABR to all oligometastatic lesions or palliative standard of care (SOC). Eligible patients had ECOG PS 0-1 and an estimated life expectancy of at least 6 months. A total of 99 patients were treated using a 1:2 ratio of SOC vs SABR. The most common primary cancer types included breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate , and the most commonly treated sites were lung, bone , liver, and adrenal gland. Although up to 5 oligo metastatic lesions were allowed, 93% had 1 -3 metastases. Five-year o verall survival for the SABR -treated patients was 42.3% vs 17.7% in the palliative SOC patients (P = .006). Five-year progression -free survival was 17.3% with MDT Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health. All rights reserved. 88 compared to zero in the p alliative standard of care group ( P = 0.001). . Compared with SOC, treatment with SBRT was not associated with decreased quality of life. A phase 2 randomized trial (SAFRON II) compared single fraction SBRT to 28 with fractionated SBRT of 48Gy in 4 frac tions in 87 patients with 1 -3 pulmonary oligometastases. There were no differences in local control, disease -free survival , or overall survival at 2 years. Toxicities and adverse events were not significantly different between the groups.

Multimodality treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy is common, espe cially in high -grade sarcomas. Multiple studies have shown that radiation improves local control. Soft tissue sarcomas are often treated with preoperative therapy to a dose of 50 Gy. Placement of clips at the time of surgery aids with boost planning if needed. Alternatively, postoperative radiation therapy can be given. External beam treatment typically consists of 50 Gy to a larger field encompassing the preoperative tumor volume plus a margin followed by a smaller boost field. Boost doses of 10-26 Gy are used, depending on the final surgical margins. Brachytherapy may also be used postoperatively, particularly in the setting of microscopic or gross residual disease after resection. Alternatively, intra - operative radiation may be considered as boost treatment at the time of surgery. In terms of radiation planning, the use of MRI imaging and CT based planning are recommended. IMRT is sometimes utilized, but is particularly helpful in the setting of pelvic o r retroperitoneal sarcoma, to minimize toxicity in this high -risk anatomic region. IMRT for sarcomas in other regions remains an area of active investigation. A recent RTOG study of image guidance suggested that toxicity is lower when field size is reduced in conjunction with daily IGRT. Many of these patients were treated with IMRT. Other retrospective comparisons of conventional radiation and IMRT have been published. A study by Folkert reported recurrence rates for 319 consecutive patients, about half of whom were treated with IMRT. There was an association between IMRT and improved local control. The authors note, however, that other confounding factors such as the use of MRI in treatment planning may explain the difference. The use of IMRT for soft tiss ue sarcomas is appropriate for tissue sarcoma. Thymoma and Thymic Carcinoma Thymomas are rare tumors arising in epithelial cells within the thymus. They can be benign or malignant. For lesions which are resectabl e, complete thymectomy and excision of tumor is recommended. Radiotherapy is added for stage III disease or in cases where the tumor is unresectable or incompletely resected. Doses of 45 - 50 Gy are used after resection with clear or close margins. A dose of 54 Gy is used for microscopically positive margins and doses of 60 -70 Gy are given for gross disease. Chemotherapy is used in advanced or metastatic disease. CT -based treatment planning is recommended, as is respiratory motion management if available. Much like mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma, IMRT is appropriate in order to spare heart and lung tissue.

IMRT has demonstrated excellent potential in sparing the organs at risk while achieving good local control. Therefore, IMRT is helpful in treating pediatric tumors that are sensitive to radiation ther apy. Please see proton beam guidelines for further details regarding use of protons in pediatric tumors. Other Tumor Types Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and stereotactic radiation techniques are used in the setting of overlapping with a prev iously irradiated field, due to the risk of toxicity or complications.

Early detection has resulted in a decrease in prostate cancer mortality over the past two decades. Active surveillance options should be discussed with individuals with low -risk prostate cancers. Furthermore, individuals with low - or intermediate -risk prostate cancer and an anticipated survival of less than 10 years based on comorbidity are recommended to be followed with observation, as the risk of over -treatment may outweigh the clinical benefit. External beam radiotherapy and surgery are the primary treatment modalities in patients who do not opt for surveillance. Improvement in radiation therapy delivery, including 3D -conformal radiation and IMRT, have allowed for the safe dose escalation which has improved cure rates in patients with localized disease. Pelvic nodal irradiation should be limited to individuals with intermediate -risk or high -risk disease. There is a trend toward hypofractionation (fewer treatments to deliver the same biologic dose) which allows patients to be treated with less disruption of their daily lives. There have been several randomized clinic al trials comparing conventionally fractionated external radiotherapy with hypofractionated regimens. RTOG 0415 was non -inferiority of hypofractionated treatment (70.8 Gy in 28 fractions) compared to conventional fractionation (73. 8 Gy in 42 fractions). There were 1092 participants. At a median follow -up of 5.9 years, the estimated 5 -year disease -free survival rate was 85.3% in the conventional radiotherapy arm and 86.3% in the hypofractionated radiotherapy arm. The hypofractionated arm was associated with a significant increase in late grade 2 and 3 gastrointestinal and genitourinary adverse events. Based on the DFS rates, hypofractionated radiotherapy was found to be non -inferior. In the HYPRO trial, patients with intermediate to high-risk prostate cancer were randomized to receive 78 Gy in 38 fractions or 64.6 Gy in 19 fractions. At 5 years, the relapse -free survival rates for conventional fractionation vs hypofractionation were 77.1% and 80.5% , respectively. Since the goal of the trial was to prove superiority of hypofractionation, the authors concluded that hypofractionation had not been proven superior to standard fractionation. Hypofractionation does appear non - inferior in this study. In the PROFIT trial, investigators randomly assigned patients with intermediate -risk prostate cancer to receive 78 Gy in 39 fractions or 60 Gy in 20 fr actions. With 6 years of follow -up, biochemical disease -free survival was the same in both groups. There were no differences in grade 3 late GI or GU toxicities reported. Five -year results of the CHHip trial were recently published. This was an open -label, randomized study looking at both effectiveness and toxicities. A total of 3216 men were included. They compared 74 Gy in 37 fractions over a perio d of 7.4 weeks with hypofractionated radiotherapy at 60 Gy in 20 fractions over a period of 4 weeks or 57 Gy in 19 fractions over a period of 3.8 wee ks. At the 5 -year follow -up, biochemical or clinical failure -free rates were 88.3% in the conventional 74 -Gy group, 90.6% in the hypofractionated 60 -Gy group, and 85.9% in the hypofractionated 57 -Gy group. While bladder and bowel symptoms peaked sooner in the hypofractionated groups (4 -5 vs 7 -8 weeks), at 18 weeks, rates were similar for all groups. Long -term a dverse effects were similar among the treatment groups. The authors concluded that the hypofractionated approach using 60 Gy in 20 fractions was non -inferior to standard fractionation using 74 Gy in 37 fractions. Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health. All rights reserved. 98 In 2018, ASTRO, ASCO, and AUA published an evidence -based guideline on hypofractionated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer. They defined moderate hypofractionation as daily fractions ranging from 240 cGy to 340 cGy and ultrahypofractionation as daily fractions > 500 cGy. The latter is given in up to 5 fractions of SBRT. In comparing moderately fractionated IMRT with conventionally fractionated treatment, the panel has recommended that hypofractionated therapy should be offered to men with low - or intermediate -risk prostate cancer who o pt for active treatment. These recommendations were both considered strong, were based on high-quality evidence, and had 100% consensus. Moderate hypofractionation should also be offered for high - risk prostate cancer where pelvic nodes will not be treated based on 94% consensus. They recommended that men be counselled of a small increased risk of temporary GI toxicity with hypofractionated regimens but noted that late GI and GU toxicities were similar in hypofractionated and conventional treatments. General and prostate specific quality of life (QOL) and patient reported outcome studies have shown good tolerance of the hypofractionated regimens. The suggested fractionation patterns are either 6,000 cGy in 20 fractions or 7,000 cGy in 28 fractions. Postoperative radiotherapy (EBRT/IMRT) can be delivered in either the adjuvant or salvage setting. Indications for adjuvant prostate bed radiotherapy include T3 primary, extracapsular disease, seminal vesicle involvement, Gleason 8 or 9 disease and positiv e margins. Salvage radiotherapy is indicated in patients at risk for local failure who have a rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) level. When adjuvant radiation therapy is indicated, it should be given within 1 year of radical prostatectomy, but after a ny post -operative issues have stabilized. ASTRO and AUA published an updated clinical practice guideline on the use of adjuvant and salvage radiotherapy after prostatectomy in 2019 to reflect new level 1 evidence demonstrating the addition of hormonal abla tion to salvage treatment . SBRT for prostate cancer is an emerging modality. This technology delivers a high biologic dose of radiation over a short period of time. The hypofraction associated with SBRT shortens the treatment time to five visits, compared to the 7 to 9 weeks typically required for IMRT. This shortened treatment time is (one week vs 8 to 9 weeks) is appreciated by individuals. The key outcomes include both tumor control and toxicity, primarily focusing on acute and chronic rectal and genitou rinary complications. While there have been no controlled studies directly comparing SBRT and alternative techniques of conformal therapy (for example, IMRT) many prospective case series and retrospective cohort studies of subjects with localized low -risk and intermediate -risk prostate cancer and prolonged life expectancies have consistently reported that SBRT is associated with an acceptable toxicity profile and tumor control that is comparable to other radiation techniques. As with other treatments for pr ostate cancer, it is unlikely that randomized comparisons will be performed. Published studies to date include single institution reports, multi -institutional phase I/II studies looking a t dose and systematic reviews. Hannan has recently published 5-year r esults of a prospective phase I/II trial of SBRT in 91 low -risk to intermediate -risk patients. About two -thirds of the patients had intermediate -risk disease. Doses of 45 -50 Gy in five fractions were given. The 5-year freedom from biochemical failure was 9 8.6%. Grade 3 or greater late urinary and gastrointestinal toxicities were 5.5% and 7%, respectively. The highest rates of toxicity were seen in the 50 Gy cohort and the authors recommend against this dose. At the lower doses, toxicities are similar to tha t seen in dose -escalated IMRT. The most recent systematic review of SBRT for prostate cancer looked at 1,472 patients in 14 studies. The most common fractionation ranged from 35 -36.25 Gy in five fractions. Most of these reports were for patients treated wi th Cyberknife. Biochemical progression -free survival ranged from 81% - 100%. Acute and late grade 3 urinary and gastrointestinal toxicities ranged from 0 -0.5% (acute) to 0.5% -1.3% (late). In May 2013, ASTRO updated its Model Policy for SBRT and states \"It is ASTRO's opinion that data supporting the use of SBRT for prostate cancer have matured to a point where SBRT could be considered an appropriate alternative for select patients with low to intermediate risk disease.\" The 2018 ASTRO, ASCO, and AUA guideli ne on ultrahypofractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer recommends offering SBRT to men with low -risk disease, considers SBRT an option in intermediate -risk disease, and does not recommend SBRT for high -risk disease outside of a clinical trial or regi stry. Brachytherapy or prostate implant is another option to deliver highly conformal doses to the prostate. For a low dose rate (LDR) implant, permanent radioactive seeds are implanted evenly throughout the gland under ultrasound guidance. For a high dose rate (HDR) implant, catheters are placed into the gland which is later irradiated as the high activity seed stops in fixed dwell positions throughout the volume. Recently, the ASCO/Ontario Guideline on brachytherapy for prostate cancer was updated. For l ow-risk patients, LDR brachytherapy is a proven option to surgery or external beam radiotherapy. For intermediate and high -risk patients, either LDR or HDR brachytherapy should be considered as boost options in appropriate patients. Studies have shown imp roved survival when brachytherapy is used in this setting compared to external Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health. All rights reserved. 99 treatment alone. Both I -125 and palladium -103 are reasonable isotopes for LDR brachytherapy. No recommendation could be made for or against the use of Cs -131. Several recent pub lications have reported results of HDR brachytherapy in the treatment of low risk and low - intermediate risk prostate cancer. These studies have shown equivalent results to those seen with IMRT, SBRT, and LDR brachytherapy. Additionally, the Groupe Europ een de Curieth erapie (GEC) and the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) have published a joint prostate brachytherapy guideline. They note that they no longer consider the recommendations for LDR and HDR brachytherapy separately and theref ore HDR monotherapy is now considered a standard treatment for low - and intermediate -risk disease.

Ninety five percent of these are basal cell carcinomas or cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas. Basal cell carcinoma i s the most common form of skin cancer. These are less likely to spread to regional lymphatics then squamous cell carcinomas. Cutaneous melanomas are much more likely to have lymph node involvement than non -melanoma skin cancers and also have a significant risk of distant metastasis unless detected early. The main risk factor for all skin cancers is UV exposure from the sun or other sources. Immunosuppressed patients, like those who have had an organ transplant, are much more commonly affected by skin cancer . The primary treatment options are surgical excision or definitive radiation therapy. A detailed review of surgical options is beyond the scope of this guideline. Radiation options include superficial and orthovoltage x -rays, electrons, or high energy pho tons delivered with either 3D conformal or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The vast majority of non -melanoma skin cancer lesions which are not approached surgically are treated with low energy x -rays or electrons where the cure rate approache s 95%. Melanomas or other skin cancers with risk of lymphatic involvement are best treated with 3D conformal and occasionally IMRT techniques. In 2019, ASTRO published a Clinical Practice Guideline for definitive and postoperative treatment of basal and squamous cell cancers of the skin. The reviewed the commonly used radiation modalities used to treat skin cancer including electrons, low energy x -rays, megavoltage x -rays and brachytherapy. Regarding brachytherapy, they note that this technique may be prefe rentially used to for specific anatomic locations with complicated topology. Due to limited follow up information, they stress caution against extrapolating local control and toxicity data for electronic brachytherapy as compared to other radiation modalit ies. NCCN has published guidelines for the treatment of basal cell, squamous cell and melanoma skin cancers. For all three guidelines, they note that there are \"insufficient long -term efficacy and safety data to support the routine use of electronic surfac e brachytherapy.\" The American Brachytherapy Society concludes that \"it is not recommended that electronic brachytherapy be utilized for accelerated partial breast irradiation, non - melanomatous skin cancers, or vaginal cuff brachytherapy outside prospectiv e clinical trials at this time.\" Clinical Indications Superficial, Orthovoltage and 2D or 3D Conformal Radiotherapy is appropriate for skin cancer when ANY of the following conditions are met: As an alternative to surgery As postoperative treatment after surgery when there are positive margins or other high risk features Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) is appropriate for skin cancer when ANY of the following conditions are met: To treat a skin cancer of the head and neck region when the regio nal lymphatics will be treated To treat cutaneous melanoma To treat a previously irradiated field Brachytherapy is appropriate for skin cancer when ANY of the following conditions are met: To treat a skin cancer which is not amenable to surgery or external beam radiation Radiation Therapy \u00a9 2023 AIM Specialty Health.
