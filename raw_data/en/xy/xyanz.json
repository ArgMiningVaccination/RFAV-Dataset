Some, like ours, are free of unnecessary additives and fillers. On top of that, we're transparent about what we DO put in our supplements. Unfortunately, this is not common practice. The problem is that the FDA doesn't regulate the supplement market and yet has cleared over 3,000 additives to be used on their list of approved ingredients. Many of these additives have been shown in studies to damage your health and yet they're still allowed to be added to your supplements. But why do companies feel the need to use additives?Well, they're used for a few reasons. First, they're used as flow agents to allow supplements to run through manufacturing machines without gumming up the equipment. Then they're used as binders, for holding together powder ingredients that are too fluffy. They're also used as fillers in order to bulk out capsules, make them look more attractive, improve their taste, and much, much more. Here are just a few additives and fillers to look out for (and avoid at all costs!) These are just some of the toxic additives you should watch out for, but unfortunately, until the FDA chooses to monitor more strictly what goes into supplements, a lot of it is guesswork. The good news is, when you buy our herbal supplements you can rest assured they never contain questionable additives and cheap fillers.
