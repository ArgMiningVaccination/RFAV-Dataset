Refrigerant fluid options for each storage condition, thermal load to cool each type of vaccine and environmental impacts of refrigerants are compared. An energy simulation using the EUED (energy usage effectiveness design) index was developed. The Oxford-AstraZeneca, Janssen COVID-19 and CoronaVac vaccines show 9.34-times higher energy efficiency than Pfizer. In addition, a TEWI (total equivalent warming impact) simulation was developed that prioritizes direct environmental impacts and indirect in refrigeration. From this analysis, it is concluded that the cold storage of Oxford-AstraZeneca, Janssen COVID-19 and CoronaVac vaccines in Brazil generates 35-times less environmental impact than the Pfizer vaccine.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-03-26", "cleaned_text": "Refrigeration of COVID-19 Vaccines: Ideal Storage Characteristics, Energy Efficiency and Environmental Impacts of Various Vaccine Options [https://doi.org/10.3390/en14071849](https://doi.org/10.3390/en14071849) [COVID-19 Pandemics: Energy, Economic, Environmental, There are several different cold storage conditions between multiple brands. In the United States of America (USA) and Europe, the first approved vaccines were Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna [ [2](#B2-energies-14-01849)]. In Brazil, the first vaccines approved were CoronaVac and Oxford-AstraZeneca [ [3](#B3-energies-14-01849)]. In Argentina, the first approved vaccine was Sputnik V. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was the last vaccine to be approved both in the USA and Europe. It is a fact that the vaccine itself to be produced goes through several unique principles of refrigeration and clean rooms. One of the characteristics of these clean rooms is the BSL-03 (Biosafety Security Level) [ [4](#B4-energies-14-01849)], with cascades of air pressure that are essential to ensure the safety of the users. After all the work to develop and produce the vaccines, however, they face cold storage and distribution issues. Thus, assessment of the electricity consumption and the environmental impacts helps each country to make the appropriate decision about which brand of vaccine to choose. In doing so, each must consider the operational costs and environmental factors produced during their cold storage [ [5](#B5-energies-14-01849)]. [6](#B6-energies-14-01849)], the brand's vaccine needs a storage temperature of70 \u00b0C \u00b1 10 \u00b0C. As soon as a vaccination center receives a thermal sender with Pfizer's vaccines, it has three storage options: - Ultra-low-temperature freezers, which are available on the market and can extend service life by up to six months; - Pfizer thermal shipper, in which doses will arrive, which can be used as temporary storage units, recharging with dry ice every five days for up to 30 days of storage; - Refrigeration units commonly available in hospitals. The vaccine can be stored for five days, refrigerated at 2-8 \u00b0C. [7](#B7-energies-14-01849)]: - The vaccine will arrive frozen between 25 \u00b0C and 15 \u00b0C and needs to be stored at the same temperature. After defrosting, the vaccine may be thawed in the refrigerator or at room temperature [ [8](#B8-energies-14-01849)]; - Refrigerator: 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C for 2 h and 30 min; - Room temperature: between 15 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C for 1 h.; - Unpunctured vials may be kept between 8 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C for up to 12 h; - Thawed vaccines cannot be refrozen; - Vaccine vials may be stored in the refrigerator between 2 \u00b0C and 8 \u00b0C for up to 30 days before vials are punctured. After 30 days, any remaining vials should be removed from the refrigerator and discarded following manufacturer and jurisdiction guidance on proper disposal [ [7](#B7-energies-14-01849)]. [9](#B9-energies-14-01849)] stated that the CoronaVac vaccine can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures\u2014that is, 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C\u2014and it remains valid for a period of up to three years, offering an advantage for distribution in places where access to refrigeration is a challenge. [10](#B10-energies-14-01849)]: - It can be stored in a refrigerator (2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C); - It should not freeze; - After the first dose is withdrawn, the vaccine should be used as soon as possible and within six hours. During use, it can be stored from 2 \u00b0C to 25 \u00b0C. [11](#B11-energies-14-01849)]. [12](#B12-energies-14-01849)]. [Table 1](#energies-14-01849-t001), since these will be the values used for further calculations. 2. Materials and Methods [13](#B13-energies-14-01849)]: - Height, H = 2050 mm; - Length, L = 1600 mm; - Width, W = 790 mm; - Gross volume, Vg = 2.59 m3; - Useful volume, Vu = 1.05 m3; - Estimated dose capacity, n = 100,000; - Dose Volume, Vd = 0.3 ml (= 3.0 \u00d7 107 m3). [Table 1](#energies-14-01849-t001)with an ambient temperature of 24 \u00b0C. The results of the cooling load are shown in [Table 2](#energies-14-01849-t002)[ [14](#B14-energies-14-01849)]. It is important to point out that cold room temperatures were used for the doses entering the refrigeration equipment. Additionally, the inlet vaccine temperatures (see [Table 1](#energies-14-01849-t001)) lead to multiple air changes in 24 h; with an air change factor, ACF = 43.5. [15](#B15-energies-14-01849)] dictates the energy efficiency parameters. There are some parameters for commercial refrigerators, commercial freezers and refrigeration. The specific energy consumption given in kWh/day is based on the AHRI 1201-2013 standard. However, this AHRI standard does not specify a range for vaccine equipment. Thus, one of the goals of this study is to create a method to compare this type of equipment, the Vaccine EUED (energy usage effectiveness design), and to compare the greenhouse effect to Vaccine TEWI (Total Equivalent Warming Impact) [ [16](#B16-energies-14-01849)]. To compare the energy efficiency of cold vaccine storage equipment, it is necessary to gauge some parameters, such as differentiating between air intake and condensation temperature, and differentiating between storage temperature and evaporation temperature. In addition to the isentropic coefficient of the compressor, the AHRI 210/240-2017 [ [17](#B17-energies-14-01849)] normally uses the difference between the air inlet and condensation temperatures of 10 \u00b0C, due to the vaccine refrigerators being located in acclimatized places. The ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 72-2018 considers that the intake of air in the condenser must be 24 \u00b0C at room temperature [ [18](#B18-energies-14-01849)]. [Table 3](#energies-14-01849-t003)includes the temperature values and parameters for each type of vaccine. [19](#B19-energies-14-01849)]; and (2) the Kigali protocol [ [20](#B20-energies-14-01849)] encouraging the use of refrigerants with low Global Warming Potential (GWP). For example, the R-404A has a high GWP index (GWP = 3922), while R-134A has a GWP = 1430. Although natural fluids have low GWP, they are not used in vaccine refrigerators. For example, an ammonia system is very complex for small systems, besides its dangerous toxicity [ [21](#B21-energies-14-01849)]. [22](#B22-energies-14-01849)] states that R134A is often used for +4 \u00b0C cold rooms but is not suitable for 20 \u00b0C freezer rooms. Various alternative gases are available for this purpose, among them the gas R404A. However, it is already being phased out (virgin R404A can no longer be used in new equipment, but recovered or reclaimed R404A can be used until the end of 2030) and superseded by new, low-GWP refrigerants such as R454C, R455A and R1234yf for small packaged equipment and medium-sized multi-compressor equipment, although it is still used in a number of systems. [Table 4](#energies-14-01849-t004)shows the refrigerant selected for the refrigeration system of each vaccine due to thermal requirements. The table also shows the GWP, the refrigerant load required, the equivalent CO2 emissions and the CO2 emissions when R-404A is used instead of low-GWP R-449A. [Figure 1](#energies-14-01849-f001)shows the differences between the environmental impact in terms of CO2 emissions, assuming the use of R-404A initial refrigerant load. Despite the heat load for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, it is 2.2-times greater than that of Oxford-AstraZeneca, CoronaVac and Janssen COVID-19 (see [Table 2](#energies-14-01849-t002)). The environmental impact due to the refrigerant, which is required to comply with the needed storage temperature, has a difference of almost 10 times. [23](#B23-energies-14-01849)]. [Figure 2](#energies-14-01849-f002)shows the COP of the refrigeration system with condenser fans and an evaporator for vaccines. 2.1. Vaccine Energy Usage provided by the index involves all natural parameters of a region, considering the location where a DC is to be installed (air dry and wet bulb temperatures, air dew point temperature and soil temperature). The EUED given by Equation (1) can be used in the design phase to predict a measurement of the DC efficiency. [Table 2](#energies-14-01849-t002), the COP determined and shown in [Figure 2](#energies-14-01849-f002), a compressor load factor of 0.6 and 8760 h of operation, the Vaccine EUED index, representing the energy consumption for each vaccine refrigeration system during a year, is shown in [Figure 3](#energies-14-01849-f003). 2.2. Vaccine Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI) [33](#B33-energies-14-01849)]: - Direct emission\u2014refrigerant released during the lifetime of the equipment, including losses not recovered on the final disposal; - Indirect emission\u2014the impact of CO2 emissions from fossil fuels used to generate the electric energy that is used in the operation of the equipment throughout its lifetime. [9](#B9-energies-14-01849)]. [34](#B34-energies-14-01849)]. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) [ [35](#B35-energies-14-01849)], the United States of America emits 0.417 kg CO2/kWh. The Vaccine TEWI index uses TEWI concepts in addition to the Vaccine EUED index, for a 10-year lifecycle, is given by Equation (5) [ [36](#B36-energies-14-01849)]: [Table 5](#energies-14-01849-t005)applying Equation (5). [Figure 4](#energies-14-01849-f004)compares the Vaccine TEWI of a refrigerator to store 100,000 vaccine doses during the equipment lifecycle (10 years), considering a 60% of use factor. Given the difference between the TEWI values of Brazil and the USA, it is verified that the energy mix has a great influence on the environmental impacts. For example, a refrigerator to cold-store the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in the USA will emit almost 35-times more CO2 than that of a refrigerator to cold-store the Oxford-AstraZeneca, CoronaVac or Janssen COVID-19 vaccine in Brazil. 3. Analysis and Discussion of Results 3.1. Worldwide Vaccine EUED [Table 6](#energies-14-01849-t006). It is important to emphasize that this energy consumption is only related to vaccine cold conservation; it does not consider its manufacturing and transportation. There are several environmental impacts since these vaccines usually need low temperatures and are often transported by plane. [35](#B35-energies-14-01849)]. 3.2. Worldwide Vaccine TEWI [36](#B36-energies-14-01849)]. In this case, the use of the Vaccine TEWI indicator in the lifecycle of a refrigeration system is the best way to apply the calculation for a simulation; a lifecycle of 10 years has been used. [Table 7](#energies-14-01849-t007). [Table 8](#energies-14-01849-t008)[ [37](#B37-energies-14-01849)]. The comparison with cars allows to compare easily point out the environmental impact of the refrigeration systems for the COVID 19 vaccines. The generation of CO2 by the refrigerated storage of vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech in the USA would be equivalent to the circulation of 158,636 cars running 20,000 km, and that the generation of CO2 by the refrigerated storage of vaccines from Oxford-AstraZeneca, CoronaVac and Janssen COVID-19 vaccine in Brazil would be equivalent to 4549 cars running the same length. [Table 6](#energies-14-01849-t006), [Table 7](#energies-14-01849-t007)and [Table 8](#energies-14-01849-t008)compare the different vaccine brands for the same number of doses, it is important to highlight that the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine requires a single dose [ [38](#B38-energies-14-01849)], while the others require two doses. So, its environmental impact is the lowest. 4.
