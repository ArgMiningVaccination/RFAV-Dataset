Design Direction: Steven Stave Marketing Manager: Courtney Ingram Printed in China Last digit is the print number: 987654321 Preface Thousands of pregnant and breast-feeding women take a prescription or over-the- counter drug each day. Though for the most part safe, a small percentage of theseactions will have unintended adverse consequences for either mother or child. An additional percentage proves ineffective, due in part to the unique physiology of pregnancy or breastfeeding. And while an unnecessary drug should never be givento the pregnant or breast-feeding woman, an important therapy should never bewithheld because of her status. Health care givers are now accustomed to routinely checking the FDA classification of a drug before prescribing it. Unfortunately, this classification system, though simple in concept, is dated, rarely revised as new infor-mation becomes available, and too simplistic to account for the physiology and health care needs of pregnant and breast-feeding women. Few drugs are approved by the FDA for use during pregnancy, and even oxytocin is a Category X agent. The impor-tant information provided by the manufacturer is often couched in protective legalese and never focuses on the needs of the obstetrical health care provider. Prior attempts to provide the caregiver the needed information have proven dense and filled withdescriptions of studies, but not their implications. As a result, they are used in practiceas a source of the FDA pregnancy category. So much has changed since the publication of the first edition. I would like to thank the many healthcare providers who provided valuable feedback now incorporated intothe second edition. In addition to the several hundred new drugs added since the first publication, I have attempted to further enhance the value of the text by adding International Names and relevant Drug Interactions . The text continues its user- friendly format available in both electronic and hardcopy media. The purpose of this text remains to provide a user-friendly, pregnancy-lactation- focused reference for the use of the concerned health care provider. Do not use this asa reference when prescribing for a man. And though we recommend consulting a more complete reference before prescribing an unfamiliar agent, the information provided will aid the safe prescribing of drugs familiar to the physician. Thenumber of new drugs released over the last decade is great, and their knownimpact on pregnancy and lactation, and vice versa often limited to absent. This is indeed a living text, coupled to a convenient, user-friendly hand-held electronic ver- sion that will be updated and expanded on a regular basis. Conflicts in FDA class withexisting knowledge are pointed out, and recommendations made wherever possible based on medical evidence. Over the next few years, the FDA has embarked on a new and more detailed classification of drug safety during pregnancy. It is my intent toinclude this information wherever possible into the updates provided free to the electronic version. We encourage readers to contact us at Technical.support@elsevier.com with any requests, errors, or conflicts. Carl P. Weiner January 25, 2009Foreword to the First Edition The study of medication use in pregnancy is one of the least developed and most neglected areas of clinical pharmacology and drug research. Although pregnancy iswidely regarded as a special population due to both the unique maternal physiology and the vulnerability of the developing fetus, researchers and pharmaceutical compa- nies have been reticent to evaluate optimal modalities of treatment for this group. Theissue is compounded by the enormous number of medications women are exposed toduring pregnancy. Epidemiological surveys indicate nearly two thirds of all pregnant women use four to five drugs during pregnancy through delivery. Women with medical conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, and hypertension must continue ther-apy while pregnant. In some cases, due to a justified or unjustified concern for the developing fetus, the medication prescribed is either withheld, inadequate to treat the maternal condition, or not monitored closely enough as pregnancy progresses forneeded adjustments in dosing. The result is a double negative, that of fetal exposure without maternal or fetal benefit. The lack of Food and Drug Administration obstetric labeling and the near universal off-label use of drugs are the direct result of the paucityof research and clinical trials in this special population. The public concern stemsfrom the use of drugs in pregnancy based on an empiric approach rather than a scientific basis, and does not take into account the many alterations in pregnancy. There are profound physiologic changes in pregnancy involving the mother, pla- centa and fetus that may alter absorption, distribution and elimination of drugs. Forexample, there is a decrease in gastric emptying and an increase in intestinal transit time, both of which may alter gastrointestinal absorption of drugs. Similarly, thephysiologic increase in pulmonary blood flow, hyperventilation, or increased tidal volume during pregnancy may increase the absorption of inhalants. The dramatic increase in blood volume with subsequent dilutional hypoalbuminemia, especiallyin the third trimester, can be associated with a decreased drug binding capacity and may profoundly affect the distribution of many drugs during pregnancy. These are but a few of the many examples of the complex changes in pregnancy that affect the type,dosing, and effectiveness of medications in this special population Daily advances in therapeutics dramatically increase the number and types of medications available more rapidly than textbooks can be updated. This new textby Weiner and Buhimschi, Drugs for Pregnant and Lactating Women, helps fill thevoid. It is a comprehensive resource addressing the unique needs of this special population. Each drug entry includes the generic and trade names, drug class, indica- tion(s) (on and off label), mechanism(s) of action, dosage, maternal and fetal con-siderations, breastfeeding safety, references, FDA pregnancy and lactation categories, and a summary. Wherever possible, evidence-based recommendations are made. This unique reference combines the printed word with an electronic version updatedquarterly to allow for the incorporation of the new therapeutics. This design is userfriendly for the busy clinician and includes prescribing information as well as a review of the published experience with the drug in pregnancy and lactation. As the first of its type, Drugs for Pregnant and Lactating Women will simplify the clinician's ability tomaintain updated information on medications in pregnancy and facilitate the incor- poration of more rigorous study into the use of medications in the pregnant and lactating populations. Catherine Y. Spong, MD Chief, Pregnancy and Perinatology Branch PPB CRMC NICHD NIH Bethesda, MarylandForeword to the Second Edition This is a dream come true for all of those who care for pregnant and non-pregnant women. There is nothing like this in medical literature. In the past, I have beeninvolved in the publications of several texts on drugs and pregnancy. This new text is on the leading edge of science and knowledge for women and drugs, with more than 720 generic drugs with their 1500 trade names listed in alphabetical order to makeidentification easy for each drug. Over-the-counter drugs are also included. Theinformation provided in both hard text and electronic versions is very extensive, concise, and user friendly. Its availability as an electronic version for hand-held com- puter devices, that will be updated for the life of the edition, is particularly exciting.This will not only benefit all health care workers in the field of obstetrics and gyne- cology, but will also allow instantaneous access to drug related questions. Included in text and electronic versions are the following headings: Name Class IndicationsDosage with QualifiersMaternal Considerations Fetal Considerations Breastfeeding SafetyReferences Summary Additionally, there are lists of known teratogens, pregnancy drug registries, AHA endocarditis guidelines, FDA category definitions, and the percent of drugs assigned to them also included. Thanks go to Dr. Weiner for his ingenuity in taking a complicated problem and making it straightforward and simple for those who care for pregnant and non-pregnant women. This effort is the first to simultaneously embrace text and an electronic version for hand-held computers. The combination of Elsevier-the world's largest health sciences publisher-and Dr. Weiner-an individual who has a long-term interest in female reproduction and especially high-risk obstetrics-assures success of the project. This is the new frontier in medical publishing and we will look forward to additions and revisions in the electronic format. Frederick P. Zuspan, MD Professor and Chairman, Emeritus The Ohio State University School of Medicine and Public Health Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology; Emeritus Editor, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology Las Vegas, NevadaAcknowledgment The second edition turned into a predominantly solo journey. I want to recognize and thank Carol, who spent many evenings and weekends alone while I worked on thetext. Your support is central. Thank you. I also want to acknowledge the important contributions of my good friend Dr. Catalin Buhimschi. Carl P. WeinerIntroduction Frustrated by the absence of a comprehensive resource that recognizes the uniqueness of medical needs during pregnancy and lactation, we created Drugs for Pregnant andLactating Women as an easy-to-use, reader friendly resource containing the key information required by caregivers to make prescribing decisions. Too often, we check only the FDA Pregnancy Category before making a decision to prescribe ordiscontinue a medication. Unfortunately, few of us have read these definitions(TABLE 1), understand their limitations, and realize the assigned category is essen- tially stagnant, based predominantly on information available when the drug was approved in the United States, and only occasionally officially updated to reflectadvancing knowledge. Two-thirds of all drugs sold in the United States are classified Category C, and less than 1% Category A. With the benefit of added experience, we learn that many Category X drugs are not absolutely contraindicated during preg-nancy, and several Category C or D drugs are either clear human teratogens or have frequent and serious adverse fetal effects. These facts are highlighted by a study comparing the categorization of same drugs by the appropriate agencies in theUnited States, Australia, and Sweden (Addis A, Sharabi S, Bonati M. Drug Saf2000; 23:245-53). Only 25% of the 236 drugs common to all 3 systems were placed into the same risk factor category. Nor does the categorization inform the provider how either pregnancy or lactation may alter the patient's response to therapy com-pared to the nonpregnant state. The FDA is well aware of these limitations and is actively considering revision. Lastly, increasingly busy health care providers are often dependent on either the advertisements in trade journals or the pharmaceutical housedetail people for up-to-date information on new drugs. Yet, a recent study observed that promotional claims are frequently misleading and the cited studies were either unretrievable or failed to back-up the particular claim (Villanueva P, Peiro S, Libero J,Pereiro I. Lancet 2003; 361:27-32). This is not a new problem (Wilkes MS, Doblin B, Shapiro M. Ann Intern Med 1992; 116:912-19). This text seeks to reduce the aforenoted limitations by using brief descriptions to summarize the current level of knowledge. New for the second edition, the informa- tion on each drug is divided into 12 sections. Those who purchase the electronic version can search by subgroups or names in each of these sections. The first section of the text lists the generic Name followed by trade names used in the United States. Some drugs have a half dozen or more trade names, and are difficultto remember if you do not use them regularly. New for the second edition, the second section lists the common International Trade Names. It is our intent for this to be an international resource for obstetriccaregivers. The third section is the drug Class, such as antibiotic (type), nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory (NSAID), anticonvulsant, antihypertensive, etc. This makes it easier to sort drugs in search of alternative or complementary agents when necessary. The fourth section lists the Indications for the drug. In most, though not all instances, this list is confined to FDA approved indications. Popular off-label usesare typically reviewed in a subsequent section. The fifth section is the known or presumed Mechanism of Action. This is frequently either unknown, or while several activities of the drug are known, it is unclear whetherthey are responsible for the disease-directed action of the drug. Knowledge of the mechanism of action is important for the selection of complementary drugs and the prediction of adverse effects. The sixth section contains the Dose by specific indication. Also included in this section are most relevant Contraindications and Cautions. This information is mostlyderived from manufacturer-provided material, but tailored for women. You will notfind erectile dysfunction or benign prostatic hypertrophy as either an indication or acontraindication for a particular drug, though they certainly might be listed in a general drug text. Also frequently removed from the list are typical corporate liability comments on pregnancy that are notsubstantiated by either animal or human experience. The dose advice provided has been checked multi- ple times by at least 3 individuals. However, the very design of this text assumes the prescriber has previously familiarized him- or herself with the contents of the package insert. The details providedunder Dose are a suitable refresher, but not a substitute. We strongly recommend you confirm the dose when using an unfamiliar drug. Further, we have adopted the approach of simply noting when a dose modification must be considered, rather than trying to be all things for all situations. The standard'NOTE' mentions the need for either renal or hepatic dosing. This means that, in the face of compro-mised renal or hepatic function, the physician must take into account altered clearance of the drug. The formulas are usually contained in the package insert or may be discussed with the dispensing pharmacist. The seventh and eighth sections form the unique core of the text. In the seventh, titled Maternal Considerations, we review how the drug impacts pregnancy and vice versa. We summarize the publishedexperience during pregnancy, highlighting any known problems. Off-label uses are detailed, as is the evidence for efficacy if it exists. We also note applications that have proved unsuccessful. The sad realityis that many drugs used during pregnancy are either ineffective or poorly effective for their most common uses\u2014the tocolytic agents being prime examples. Specific evidence-based recommendations are made wherever possible. It is in this section we also detail the known drug Side Effects, againfocusing on mother and child. Priapism and impotence may be important side effects in some popula-tions, but not in the one our envisioned reader provides care. The eighth section is titled Fetal Considerations. Here, the impact of the drug on the human fetus is reviewed, information on placental transfer presented (e.g., the fetal umbilical vein: maternal vein ratio),and any adverse effects summarized. The possible applications of a drug for fetal therapy and an appraisal of its efficacy will also be found here. Animal data are presented when human experience is missing. Rodent teratogenicity studies are summarized, where available, recognizing there are well-known human teratogens, which were not teratogens in rodents (e.g. thalidomide). Of potential rele- vance is the dose at which the adverse effects are seen in rodents (in terms of multiples of the maximum recommended human dose), and the presence or absence of maternal toxicity that may be the proximatecause of the noted effect. Much of this information is published in peer-reviewed articles, but in some instances, the only source of this information is the manufacturer. It is frightening to us, as practitioners, to find how little is known about many commonly used drugs during pregnancy and lactation. It is ourhope readers will be encouraged when confronted with the facts to try and fill in the missing informationwith quality studies. It is of at least equal concern the number of drugs withheld from women during pregnancy or lactation because of unsubstantiated or, at times, past but refuted theories. New for the second edition, the ninth section is entitled Drug Interactions. Here, the more common or dangerous drug:drug interactions are noted. This is an ever growing risk in this era of polypharmacy. The tenth section is Breastfeeding. We note whether the drug enters human breast milk, and the kinetics of its excretion, if known. The ideal information includes the weight-corrected percent of the maternal dose ingested by the unsupplemented 3kg-newborn and the resulting neonatal blood levels. The number of times the ideal is achieved can be counted on the hands of a single individual. When this information is not known, a milk:plasma (M:P) ratio or concentration is given. This informationprovides limited information, and may indeed mislead the reader. When no human data are available,animal (typically rodent) is proffered, wherever available. Some of this information is published in peer- reviewed articles, and some by the manufacturer. Occasional conflicts are noted, and wherever possible, specific evidence-based recommendations made. For example, many drugs are used for a limited periodor even one-time use. When the patient wishes to continue breastfeeding, but there is reasonable doubt of safety, we will recommend the patient pump her breasts for a period of time before resuming breastfeeding. In other instances, the drug may be safe, but the mother not, for example, the womanwith HIV. Section eleven contains salient References. Most are directed at source material, but some are reviews. This information is rarely in packaged inserts (which comprise, for example, the PHYSICIANS DESKREFERENCE) and, cover maternal, fetal, and lactational issues. The final section, section twelve, is entitled Summary. In this section, the reader will find the FDA category as published in the package insert and a code assigned by the editors for breast-feeding safety(S, safe; NS, not safe; and U, unknown). Often there is some but not enough information for a particularconclusion. In these situations, we have placed a question mark next to the selected code (e.g., S?). xivThe final comments always reflect the need to balance risk. This is a patient-specific process and not given to absolutes. In many instances, the reader is informed there are other alternatives for which thereare more experience in pregnancy and lactation. We strongly suggest that wherever possible, the reader seek and use those agents. Pregnancy is not the occasion to be a pioneer, if unnecessary. If there is a post- marketing registry, the telephone number is listed in the Appendix. These registries have the potential toidentify important but unusual outcomes. This text has always been designed as a living resource. New print editions will be frequent, and those readers with the electronic version will receive periodic updates when they re-synchronize their hand-held computers. There are already several hundred new drugs in the second compared to the firstedition, and all have been subject in the second edition to a literature search. Also new is a growing number of popular herbal remedies with which the obstetrical caregiver will be confronted during the normal course of practice. Readers are encouraged to contact the editors with comments, concerns, andcriticisms.

Acarbose is the subject of a large ongoing trial to determine whether its use can reduce or delay the onset of type II diabetes in patients with impaired glucose intolerance. The preliminary results indicate benefit. There are no adequatereports or well-controlled studies of acarbose in pregnant women. There is a single report of 6 pregnant women with impaired glucose tolerance treated with acarbose . Glucose levels returned to normal, and the pregnancies were reportedly uncomplicated.Side effects include intestinal discomfort consisting of pain, diarrhea, flatulence, elevated LFTs, and jaundice. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Only 2% of the oral dose is absorbed. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity orIUGR despite the use of doses almost 10 /C2higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether acarbose enters human breast milk. A single rat study suggests acarbose might alter the composition of breast milk by inhibiting lipogenesis. Less than 2% of acarbose is bioavailable. It is unlikely any would be excreted into the milkand or absorbed by the neonate. #Drug Interactions ................ Some drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia. They includethiazides and similar class diuretics, corticosteroids,phenothiazines, thyroid oral contraceptives, phenytoin calcium channel- blocking drugs, and isoniazid . Women taking both acarbose and one of these drugs should be monitored closely for loss of glucose control. Discontinuation of such drugs may lead to hypoglycemia. Intestinal adsorbents (e.g., charcoal) and digestive enzyme such as amylase andpancreatin may reduce the effect of acarbose and should not be taken together.Acarbose may alter digoxin when Product information.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of acebutolol in pregnant women. Acebutolol was significantly less successful than either labetalol ora-methyldopa in controlling chronic arterial hypertension >90mmHg in one small randomized trial. The rates of pregnancy complications amongthe 3 groups of women were similar.Side effects include CHF, bronchospasm, fatigue, dizziness, headache, constipation, and diarrhea. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studiesin human fetuses. Acebutolol and its main metabolite, N-acetylacebutolol, cross the placenta with a 0.6:0.8 M:F ratio. A prospective study of acebutolol's hemodynamic and renal impact on neonates after chronic in utero exposure found hemodynamic failure in 5/11 children delivered of treatedmothers. Exposed neonates had significantly less early neonataldiuresis, absence of a significant rise in the GFRs, and reducedsodium and calcium balances. The direct effect of the drug on the glomerular and tubular functions and/or the renal arteriolar vasomotoricity could explain these effects. 2#Breastfeeding Safety .......... Acebutolol and N-acetylacebutolol are concentrated in breast milk (M:P ratios 2:9 for acebutolol and 2:25 for N-acetylacebutolol ), though symptoms of neonatal b-blockade are rarely reported. A neonate might receive pharmacologically active amounts of acebutolol if the daily maternal dosage exceeds 400mg and/or renal function in the mother is impaired. However,the American Academy of Pediatrics considers acebutolol permissible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine, may have an additive effect when given with b-blockers. Women treated with both acebutolol and catecholamine depletors should be observed closely for bradycardia or hypotension that may present as vertigo, syncope/presyncope, or orthostatic hypotension without compensatory tachycardia.Women receiving b-blockers should be warned that hypertensive responses may follow the combined use of b-blockers and a-adrenergic agonists, including those in OTC cold remedies and vasoconstrictive nasal drops.NSAIDs may J Clin Pharmacol1986; 30:737-9.Committee on Drugs, American Academy of Pediatrics.

Acetaminophen is component of a long list of OTC medications. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. During the 1st trimester, the mean t/2 is significantly lower and oral clearance is significantly higher compared to nonpregnant controlsubjects. Only during pregnancy is weight related to clearance, 4suggesting the dose may need to be adjusted in obese women. Ibuprofen provides more rapid relief of perineal pain after vaginal delivery. Up to2=3of pregnant women ingest acetaminophen some time during gestation. In one recent RCT, acetaminophen plus oxycodone was superior to patient- controlled morphine for the relief of post-cesarean pain. There are no obvious differences in clearance at term. Chronic abuseand overdose are the most common problems. The damageappears secondary to free radical toxicity with consumption of glutathione. N-acetylcysteine is the treatment of choice for acute overdose. In one prospective case-control study, use of prenatal ibuprofen, naproxen, andaspirin, but not acetaminophen, increased the risk of spontaneous abortion by 80% (adjusted hazard ratio 1.8 [95% CI 1.0-3.2]). The association was stronger if the initial use occurred around conception or if the use lastedmore than a week.Side There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Acetaminophen crosses the human placenta, reaching steady state in the isolated perfused model within 1h.The F:M ratio for acetaminophen approximated 0.12 in the pregnant ewe, and neither sulfate or glucuronide metabolitescrossed. Acetaminophen use during labor to treat the fever of chorioamnionitis is associated with improved fetal umbilicalblood gases, presumably by reducing fetal oxygen demand as the maternal core temperature declines. Although it was previously suggested that exposure to acetaminophen was associated with clubfoot and digital abnormalities, these reports are not sustained in large series. However, there appears to be a link between it and gastroschisis and small bowel atresia, but not cardiacventriculoseptal defects. Unlike aspirin, acetaminophen has no antiplatelet activity and does not pose a hemorrhagic risk to the fetus. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Acetaminophen is excreted in low concentrations into breast milk. The amount of the drug administered to the motherestimated to be available to the neonate ranges from 0.04% to 0.23%, and it is generally considered compatible withbreastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Tramadol may increase the risk of acetaminophen toxicity. Local anesthetics may increase the risk of methemoglobinemia. #References .........................

When renal tubular acidosis developed, acetazolamide was detected in the child's serum, confirming transplacental passage.

The prevalence of defects is enhanced when combined with ibuprofen . #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Acetazolamide is not concentrated in the milk, and the neonatal exposure is <0.5% of the maternal dose. It is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Acetazolamide may modify phenytoin metabolism and increase serum level of phenytoin . By decreasing the GI absorption of primidone, it may decrease serum concentrations of primidone . Acetazolamide reduces urinary excretion of quinidine and may enhance its effect. It increases lithium excretion. Acetazolamide may elevate cyclosporine levels. #References .........................

N-acetylcysteine is a prototype antioxidant presently used nearly exclusively during pregnancy for the treatment of maternal drug toxicity associated with free radical excess such as that occurringwith acetaminophen . There are no adequate reports or well- controlled studies of N-acetylcysteine in pregnant women. It has been used for the treatment of acetaminophen toxicity during pregnancy. N-acetylcysteine or another like compound may have a role in the treatment of several disorders associated with excessfree radical generation, including preterm labor and preeclampsia.For example, its administration reduced maternal hypertensionafter uterine artery ligation in rats. Side effects the placenta, reaching equilibrium with maternal sera. In laboratory studies, it reduces embryo toxicity associated with hyperglycemia, hypoxia, and sepsis. In otherstudies, it reduces the adverse fetal effects of maternal inflammation by in part blocking the inflammation-stimulated release of cytokines. More recently, it has been shown to preventneuronal loss in chronically hypestemic guinea pig fetuses. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether N-acetylcysteine enters human breast milk. It is unlikely short-term administration for an acute problemwould pose a risk to the nursing infant. #Drug Interactions ................

Treatment is not curative, but rather intended to reduce the duration of symptoms and viral shedding. There is a long clinicalexperience free of obvious adverse effects. A recent meta-analysis concluded that prophylactic acyclovir beginning at 36w reduced the risks of clinical recurrence of genital herpes at delivery, cesarean section for recurrence, and herpes shedding at delivery.Suppression therapy is both effective and cost-effective whether or not the primary infection occurred during the current pregnancy. Because acyclovir is excreted via the kidneys, its t/2 may be reduced during pregnancy, but this has not been studiedspecifically. Its combination with zidovudine alters the clearance of both agents in pregnant rats.Side effects include seizures, coma, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, N/V, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, lethargy, rash, and confusion. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether acyclovir crosses the human placenta. It is unclear whether maternal prophylaxisreduces the incidence of neonatal herpes. Post-marketingsurveillance by Glaxo-Wellcome has not revealed any increase inor pattern of malformations after acyclovir exposure during the 1st trimester (756 pregnancies). A recent population-based studyfrom Denmark that included 90 systemic and 995 topicalexposures was likewise reassuring. Rodent studies are reassuring,revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Acyclovir is passively secreted and achieves concentrations in breast milk higher than maternal serum, and is used to treat neonatal herpetic infection. It is generally considered compatiblewith breastfeeding. It has been estimated that theunsupplemented newborn would ingest 1-3mg/d. #Drug Interactions and renal clearance are lower. #References ......................... Academy of Pediatrics.

Systemic absorption of adapalene across human skin is low, with none being detected in the plasma of 6 patients treated for acne in a standardized fashion for 5d with 2g. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of adapalene in pregnant women. Women of child-bearing age should be fully informed of the risks and the importance of effective contraception. This alsoapplies to patients with moderate forms of psoriasis, for which topical tazaroten is indicated. Side effects include erythema, dryness, burning, scaling, and photosensitivity. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate studies of adapalene in human pregnancy. It is unknown whether adapalene crosses the human placenta. Though the pharmacology is encouraging, t here are several reports in humans associating adapalene with fetal malformation after cutaneous exposure. The available information is insufficient to conclude cause and effect. Oral administration to rodents at 100-200/C2 the MRHD increased the risk of malformation. No abnormalities were seen in pregnancies exposed to lower concentrations. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether adapalene enters human breast milk. Considering the dose and route, it is unlikely to pose a significant risk to the breastfeeding neonate. #Drug Interactions ................ Asadapalene may cause local irritation, simultaneous use of other topical agents such as medicated or abrasive soaps and 12cleansers, soaps and cosmetics with a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol should be avoided if possible.

An endogenous purine-based nucleoside, IV adenosine is the first choice for short-term management of paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmia after a vagal maneuver fails.Co-administration of midazolam safely reduces recall of the unpleasant effects of adenosine . For long-term therapy, b- blocking agents with b 1selectivity are first-line drugs; class Ic agents and the class III drug sotalol are effective therapeutic alternatives. Adenosine has been used on multiple occasions during pregnancy to treat paroxysmal SVT. Side effects include arrhythmia (bradycardia, VF or ventricular tachycardia, asystole, complete heart block), bronchospasm, flushing, chest or groin pressure, dizziness, N/V, apprehension, palpitations, and headache. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Adenosine crosses the human placenta, and though the kinetics remain to be detailed, it enhances placentalperfusion. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of 13teratogenicity. Adenosine has been administered successfully on a number of occasions directly into the umbilical vein to achieve control of a fetal SVT. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Adenosine is a normal constituent of human breast milk, though the short t/2 suggests little, if any, of the exogenously administered adenosine will enter the milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Adenosine may be rarely associated with VF when combined with digoxin andverapamil use. Because of the potential for additive or synergistic depressant effects on the SA and AV nodes,however, adenosine should be used with caution in the presence of these agents.The effects of adenosine are antagonized by methylxanthines are enhanced by dipyridamole. Carbamazepine may increase the degree of heart block produced by other agents. #References .........................

The reader should consult a detailed text if the patient is or has recently been on an MAOI or TCA, a /C12-adrenoceptor antagonist, a diuretic, diabetes mellitus, seizure disorder #Maternal Considerations ..... In some countries, albuterol has been used as a tocolytic agent given IV, SC, or PO (also see terbutaline orritodrine, whose efficacy it compares to). There is no evidence it will stop preterm or term labor. The maximum delay (comparedto placebo), though, of 48h should permit maternaladministration of corticosteroids. b-Mimetic tocolysis is associated with pulmonary edema, especially with multiplegestation, or in women concurrently receiving glucocorticoidtherapy to hasten fetal lung maturation, or in association withinfection. The mechanism is unclear. Treatment consists of oxygen supplementation and diuresis. Maternal serum glucose and plasma insulin levels peak soon after cessation of therapyand return to preinfusion levels within 2-3h. The decline in potassium is gradual and plateaus after 2h. Once the albuterol 15infusion is stopped, the potassium returns to normal by 2h. Total WBC counts increase within an hour of initiating therapy. There is no need to administer insulin for hyperglycemia and/or potassium for hypokalemia unless thepatient is a known diabetic or is severely affected and requires immediate surgery. Side effects include bronchospasm with inhaler form, arrhythmia, tremor, nervousness, tachycardia, hyperactivity, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Albuterol appears to cross the human placenta, though the kinetics remain to be elucidated. Lessthan 10% is absorbed when administered by inhalation. There isno convincing evidence of teratogenicity after 1st trimesterexposure. In general, long-term follow-up studies of infants exposed to b-mimetic tocolysis are reassuring. Albuterol, like other b-adrenoceptor agonists, is associated with a reduction in the incidence of RDS. A single abstract suggests an increased riskof newborn retinopathy. Albuterol is teratogenic in mice at doses lower than those used in humans. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether albuterol enters human breast milk. Other b-adrenoceptor agonists such as ritodrine andterbutaline are considered safe for breastfeeding. Systemic absorption after inhalation is 10% or less. #Drug Interactions ................ Use with other sympathomimetic agents may lead to deleteriousCV effects. This does not preclude the judicious use of an adrenergic agonist aerosol bronchodilator. Albuterol should be administered with extreme caution to women using either MAOIs or TCAs (or within 2w ofdiscontinuation). b-Blockers may trigger severe bronchospasm in asthmatic women. However, under certain circumstances (e.g., as prophylaxis after MI), there may be no acceptable alternative to the use of ab-blocker in women with asthma. The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia secondary tonon-potassium-sparing diuretics may be acutely worsened byb-agonists. Serum digoxin levels decrease about 20% after a single dose of either IV or oral albuterol to normal volunteers who ingested digoxin for 10 days. #References .........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of alendronate in pregnant women. There appears only one case report of its use during pregnancy; the woman didrespond. Alendronate is superior to conjugated estrogens (with or without medroxyprogesterone ) for the prevention of bone loss in elderly women, though the combination is superior. Side effects include esophagitis, gastritis, dysphagia, esophageal ulcer, N/V, abdominal headache, pain, flu-like syndrome, and peripheral edema. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Adult plasma levels are usually below the level of detection. There was no evidence of teratogenicity in two caseseries. Alendronate crosses the rodent placenta, decreasing bone density and delaying delivery. Both the total and ionized calcium are reduced in the rodent mother and fetus. The toxic effects are reversed by calcium administration. 17#Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether alendronate enters human breast milk. However, the risk to the breastfed neonate is likely lowconsidering the low maternal systemic levels. #Drug Interactions ................ Combined use of HRT and alendronate in postmenopausal osteoporotic women revealed the suppression of bone turnoverwas greater with the combination.Calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medications interfere with absorption of alendronate . Women should wait at least 1=2h after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medications. The incidence of upper GI adverse events is increased in women receiving daily doses of alendronate greater than 10 mg and aspirin -containing products. #References .........................

As with other lipophilic opioids, alfentanil reduces the total dose of local anesthetic analgesic needed to provide comfort when combined with bupivacaine for epidural analgesia while diminishing the likelihood of an undesired motor blockade. IV alfentanil given just prior to intubation reduces the associated pressor response inwomen with preeclampsia.Side effects include respiratory arrest or depression, arrhythmia, seizure, coma, abuse or dependency, muscle rigidity, N/V, dizziness, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, confusion, sweating, dry mouth, and urinaryretention. #Fetal Considerations ........... Alfentanil crosses the placenta when given IV, though its transfer rate is lower than fentanyl (which approximates antipyrine ). Neither human embryo toxicity nor teratogenicity is reported,though 1st trimester human data are limited. Alfentanil is embryotoxic in rodents when given for 10-30d at doses 2-3/C2 the MRHD. One limited monkey study concluded offspring hadimpaired ability to do simple cognitive tasks at 2-3mo of age after exposure at 14w gestation. Lipophilic and hydrophilic characteristics of the drug influence placental transfer, as dofluctuations in maternal flow. Neonatal depression characterizedby reduced active and passive tone is reported when alfentanil is given shortly before delivery. Occasionally, a narcotic antagonistis necessary. There are no reported fetal or neonatal afterits use for conduction anesthesia. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Alfentanil is excreted into human the breast milk, though the amount excreted is too small to have any significant effect on thenewborn. #Drug Interactions ................ The magnitude and duration of CNS and CV system effects maybe enhanced when administered CNS suchas barbiturates, tranquilizers, opioids, or inhalation depression may be enhanced or prolonged.Erythromycin may inhibit alfentanil clearance and increase the risk of prolonged or delayed respiratory depression. Cimetidine reduces the alfentanil clearance. Perioperative administration of drugs affecting hepatic blood flowor enzyme function may reduce plasma alfentanil clearance and prolong recovery. #References .........................

It is rarely indicated for its traditional indications in pregnant or lactating women. There is asingle report of a woman treated during pregnancy for primary gout with allopurinol . She delivered a healthy child at 35w. More often, allopurinol has been used during pregnancy for women undergoing treatment of acute leukemia. Of future interest is itspotential as an antioxidant. Allopurinol was used unsuccessfully in one trial for the treatment of established preeclampsia. Side effects include agranulocytosis, aplastic pruritus, nausea, and gout flare. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Allopurinol readily crosses the ovine placenta, where it reaches equilibrium within 30min. It reduces superoxide 20generation in the brains of fetuses subject to intermittent umbilical cord occlusion. There is no evidence that allopurinol is teratogenic in humans. Cleft palate and skeletal defects arereported in some rodents. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Allopurinol and its metabolite oxypurinol are excreted into breast milk to a limited degree and are considered compatible withbreastfeeding. The average daily dose of allopurinol consumed by a 3kg neonate would be 0.6mg t/2 of dicumarol . The PT should be reassessed periodically in women receiving both drugs.Chlorpropamide's t/2 may be prolonged by allopurinol, since allopurinol andchlorpropamide compete for excretion by the renal tubule.

Alprazolam is rarely indicated during pregnancy. There are few published reports of alprazolam use during pregnancy. Abrupt cessation of therapy is associated with a discontinuation-emergent 24syndrome that includes neuropsychiatric, GI, dermatologic, CV, and visual symptoms. Side effects include physical dependence, syncope, tachycardia, seizures, respiratory depression, coma, drowsiness, light- headedness, dry mouth, depression, headache, constipation, diarrhea, vision, hypotension, increased salivation, and dermatitis. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. While there is no evidence that alprazolam is a human teratogen by either case reports or post-marketing surveillance, diazepam has been associated with fetal malformations. There is also concern based on studies with other benzodiazepines that postnatal behavior might be altered by antenatal exposure. Neonatal withdrawal has been reported.Treatment with phenobarbital is beneficial. In rodents, mice exposed to alprazolam demonstrate more individual than group activities and avoid open areas, and the males are more aggressive. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Alprazolam enters breast milk by passive diffusion, achieving an M:P ratio of 0.36 ingesting 0.3-5mcg/kg/d. This is approximately3% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose. Though the risk isreasonably small, alprazolam should be avoided during lactation because of the potential that it might alter neurodevelopment and because of the documented risks of withdrawal. #Drug Interactions ................ Benzodiazepines such as alprazolam can produce additive depressant effects when given with other psychotropicmedications, anticonvulsants, antihistaminics, ethanol, and other drugs that themselves produce CNS depression.Drugs or diseases that cause dry mouth or raise stomach pH may slow disintegration or dissolution, resulting in slowed or decreased absorption.Alprazolam begins its metabolism by CYP3A hydroxylation. Drugs that inhibit this pathway may have a profound effect on the clearance of alprazolam . Known drugs of concern include fluoxetine, propoxyphene, and oral contraceptives. Clinical studies of other benzodiazepines suggest a possible drug interaction between alprazolam anddiltiazem, isoniazid, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin andclarithromycin, and grapefruit juice. In vitro studies of other benzodiazepines suggest possible interactions with ergotamine, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, andnifedipine .

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of amikacin in pregnant women. Pregnancy increases the maternal clearance of aminoglycosides in general. Women with normal renal function should receive a dose of amikacin that reflects the increased clearance. Side effects include neuromuscular blockade, renal toxicity, auditory toxicity, rash, fever, headache, paresthesias, vomiting,eosinophilia, anemia, hypotension, and arthralgia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Placental transfer of amikacin may be slightly higher than the b-lactams but is lower than maternal levels. 29Aminoglycosides can damage the fetal kidney presumably because of delayed clearance, and irreversible failure has been reported after some aminoglycosides, but not amikacin. Amikacin may have less fetal renal toxicity than gentamicin . There is no evidence of teratogenicity or interference with fertility. Rodentstudies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Amikacin is excreted into breast milk, but at low concentrations. Oral absorption is poor, suggesting little systemic risk to theneonate. #Drug Interactions ................ Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis are reported after parenteral injection or topical instillation, and after aminoglycosides.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofaminophylline in pregnant women, but there is a long clinical experience. Clearance and the volume of distribution appear increased by pregnancy. IV aminophylline is not recommended unless the patient requires hospitalization. Even then, randomizedtrials suggest it provides no benefit over inhaled steroids. Uterineblood flow, as reflected by Doppler flow, is unaffected.

Side effects include seizures, respiratory arrest, arrhythmias, N/V, insomnia, headache, fever, agitation, tremor, and tachycardia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. Aminophylline crosses the human placenta rapidly, reaching an F:M ratio approaching unity. While there is no substantive evidence in humans, teratogenicity and embryotoxicity are reported in rats and rabbits at doses that exceed the MRHD by20-50/C2. This effect is dose dependent. The proconvulsant effect of aminophylline on cortical epileptic after-discharges varies during ontogeny. Recently, it was suggested that the combination ofmaternal magnesium sulfate and aminophylline reduced the incidence of neonatal intracranial hemorrhage in pretermneonates.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Placental transport occurs, but studies suggest lowtransfer especially when the umbilical venous pressure is elevated.Amiodarone has been used in isolated instances to treat a fetal arrhythmia. Among 64 pregnancies exposed to amiodarone, 17% of neonates had hypothyroidism (10 detected at birth, 1 in utero ), 18% of whom had a goiter. Hypothyroidism was transient in all,though 5 were treated short-term. Neurodevelopmental assessment of the hypothyroid infants, when carried out, revealed in some instances mild abnormalities often similar to thenonverbal learning disability syndrome. These features were alsoreported in some amiodarone -exposed euthyroid infants, suggesting a direct neurotoxic effect of amiodarone during fetal life. Fetal hypothyroidism has been reported in amiodarone- resistant fetal arrhythmia. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Amiodarone is excreted in breast milk at concentrations high enough to have a pharmacologic effect. The reported M:P ratioranges from 4.6 to 13, with concentrations in women ingesting 400mg/d ranging from 2.8 to 16.4mg/L. Neonatal hypothyroidism is reported. #Drug Interactions ................ Amiodarone may affect the metabolism of numerous drugs, and the potential for clinical impact is real. Amiodarone is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8.

Depression is common during and after pregnancy, but typically goes unrecognized. Pregnancy is not a reason a priori to discontinue psychotropic drugs. Despite the fact thatpregnant women are often exposed to tricyclic agents, thereare no well-controlled studies of amitriptyline during pregnancy. The drug is metabolized by CYP2D6, which isreduced in some Caucasians (about 7-10% of Caucasians areso-called poor metabolizers); the prevalences of poormetabolizers among Asian, black, and other populations are unclear. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations when given usual doses. Thus, serum levelsshould be monitored during pregnancy. Although amitriptyline has no effect on placental blood flow in gravid sheep, the pressor response to NE, but not phenylephrine, is enhanced. Off-label uses include bulimia, nocturnal enuresis, panic migraine, panic disorder, and postherpetic neuralgia. Side effects include MI, seizures, stroke, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, dry mouth, drowsiness, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision, increased appetite, and confusion. 37#Fetal Considerations ........... Both amitriptyline and its sib, nortriptyline, cross the human placenta. Though there is no causal evidence, case reports suggest CNS/limb abnormalities and developmental delay. While rodent studies are generally reassuring at doses below 10 /C2the MRHD, studies at 10-33 /C2the MRHD reveal CNS and facial abnormalities.

Thus, phenytoin and barbiturate blood levels should be monitored more frequently if given concurrently. Valproate andvalproic acid increase the amobarbital serum levels. Other CNS depressants, including sedatives or hypnotics,antihistamines, tranquilizers, or alcohol, may produce additive depressant effects.

Well absorbed orally except during labor, ampicillin is one of the most commonly used antibiotics during pregnancy. In addition to the noted indications, ampicillin was used without success in combination with tocolytic agents to delay or avoid preterm delivery. In comparison to nonpregnant women, pregnancy significantly increases the ampicillin elimination rate constant and total body clearance and decreases the serum t/2 and AUC. As a result, the dose during pregnancy should be increased andthe interval decreased. Ampicillin clearance is reduced by pyelonephritis and rises with successful treatment. This suggeststhe dosing interval should be reduced from 6h to 4h after thefirst 24h of therapy. When combined with sulbactam, ampicillin significantly prolongs the latency interval between rupture and delivery. Ampicillin alone is less effective. Side effects include seizures, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, interstitial nephritis, eosinophilia, and rash. #Fetal Considerations ........... There is a wide body of clinical experience with ampicillin during pregnancy. There is no evidence of teratogenicity in either humans or rodents. Throughout pregnancy, fetal drug levels reachmaternal equilibrium 1-3h after administration; thereafter, fetaldrug levels exceed maternal values.

Ampicillin-sulbactam is a reasonable selection for prophylaxis in women undergoing cesarean section. Ampicillin does not prolong the latency interval after PPROM unless paired with sulbactam . In comparison to nonpregnant women, pregnancy significantly increases the ampicillin elimination rate constant and total body clearance and decreases the serum t/2 and AUC. As a result, the dose during pregnancy should be increased and the interval decreased. Ampicillin clearance is reduced by pyelonephritis and rises with successful treatment. This suggests the dosing intervalshould be reduced from 6h to 4h after the first 24h of therapy. Side effects include seizures, and rash. #Fetal Considerations ........... Ampicillin-sulbactam reduces neonatal infectious morbidity after PPROM, but to no greater extent than erythromycin, which also prolongs the latency interval. There is no substantive evidence of teratogenicity.

Ascorbic acid is an essential vitamin that acts as a coenzyme for collagen formation, tissue repair, and the synthesis of lipids and proteins. It has both reducing and antioxidant properties and is necessary for many physiologic functions (e.g., metabolism ofiron and folic acid, resistance to infection, and preservation ofblood vessel integrity). Signs and symptoms of early ascorbic acid deficiency include malaise, irritability, arthralgia, hyperkeratosis,nosebleed, and petechial hemorrhages. Prolonged deficiency leadsto clinical scurvy. There has been limited study of ascorbic acid during human pregnancy. Supplementation with ascorbic acid and vitamin E does not reduce the rate of preeclampsia inwomen at high risk. Women with established early-onsetpreeclampsia ( <32w) likewise do not benefit from pharmacologic doses. Ascorbic acid is consumed during labor, perhaps because of oxygen free radical generation during the ischemia-reperfusionassociated with uterine contractions. Women who consume lowamounts of ascorbic acid appear to have an increased risk of developing gestational diabetes. However, maternalsupplementation of replete women with 500mg daily does notseem to alter the serum level after 1mo. Supplementation doesnot reduce the prevalence of preterm delivery. Side effects include anorexia, N/V, abdominal pain, flatus, altered sleep patterns, irritability, overactivity, erythema, rash, and itching. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown how ascorbic acid crosses the human placenta. In the pig, transfer increases with advancing gestationalage. In the human, umbilical vein ascorbic acid levels are lower 60in the preterm compared to the term fetus. Ascorbic acid concentrations in cesarean and vaginal delivery patients are higher in AF than fetal plasma. In one randomized trial initiated at 35w gestation, maternal intake of 500mg ascorbic acid failed to alter the fetal serum level from placebo. High doses of ascorbic acid taken during pregnancy are reported to cause scurvy in infantsremoved from this environment at birth. Rodent studies arereassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGRdespite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. In diabetic rats, ascorbic acid supplementation reduces the malformation rate. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Ascorbic acid is excreted in breast milk; the RDA for breastfeeding women is 90-100mg. The milk concentration corresponds with maternal dietary intake, butexcessive supplementation has little incremental effect on it.

Aspirin is a potent drug with a complex and still incompletely understood mechanisms of action. It is ubiquitous in thepharmacopeia, being combined with a multitude of agents. Aspirin is recommended by the American Heart Association for women with a 10y risk of coronary heart disease of 10% or 62higher, and by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force for women whose 5y risk of coronary heart disease is 3% or higher. Women ingesting large quantities of aspirin are at risk for myriad complications. Though one prospective case-control study suggested that the antenatal use of ibuprofen, naproxen, and possibly aspirin but not acetaminophen increased the risk of spontaneous abortion; the risk for aspirin was not confirmed in a more recent study. Chronically high salicylate levels are associatedwith prolonged pregnancy, increased puerperal bleeding, decreased birth weight, and stillbirth. It is generally recommended that high doses of aspirin be avoided during the last trimester. Low-dose aspirin plus heparin appears effective treatment for antiphospholipid syndrome characterized by recurrent 1st trimester losses. It is not an effective treatment for idiopathic recurrent losses absent a thrombophilia. Aspirin and moderate- intensity warfarin appear equally effective for preventing recurrent stroke for women with a single positive antiphospholipid antibody test result and prior stroke. Controversy continues regarding the benefit of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia, though no complications of treatment have been documented and several meta-analyses suggest a modest reduction in preeclampsia and IUGR. In onerandomized controlled trial, almost 20,000 women underwentuterine artery Doppler screening at 22-24w; 560 women with abnormal Doppler flow profiles were randomized to low-dose aspirin (150mg/d) or placebo. There was no improvement in either maternal or perinatal outcome.Side effects include GI bleeding, bleeding. #Fetal Considerations ........... Aspirin does cross the placenta. Maternal aspirin ingestion has been linked to gastroschisis and small intestine atresiaindependent of fever or cold symptoms. Low-dose aspirin doses alter fetal cyclooxygenase activity, but no sequelae are known. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... The use of aspirin in single doses should not pose any risk to the breastfeeding newborn. In contrast, women on high doses ofaspirin such as that for arthritis or rheumatic fever might best avoid breastfeeding, as the neonatal salicylate level may reachtherapeutic levels. #Drug Interactions ................ Aspirin may decrease the effects of probenecid, sulfinpyrazone, andphenylbutazone . Alcohol has a synergistic effect with aspirin in causing GI bleeding. Administration of corticosteroids with aspirin may increase the risk of GI ulceration and may reduce serum salicylate levels. Concomitant administration with pyrazolone derivatives(phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, and possibly dipyrone ) may increase the risk of GI ulceration.Urinary alkalinizers decrease aspirin effectiveness by increasing the rate of salicylate excretion.Phenobarbital decreases aspirin effectiveness by enzyme induction.Serum phenytoin levels may be increased by aspirin . Propranolol may decrease aspirin's anti-inflammatory action by competing for the same receptors. #References ......................... Coomarasamy A, 2001; 322:329-33.

Hypertension complicates 5-10% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal death and morbidity. Severe hypertension (systolic BP = 170mmHg and/or diastolic BP = 110mmHg) should be treated immediately. Mild, chronichypertension is associated with increased maternal and fetal risks,but there is no consensus as to whether mild to moderate hypertension should be treated during pregnancy. The incidence of transient severe hypertension, antenatal hospitalization,proteinuria, and neonatal RDS may be decreased by therapy, butfetal growth may be impaired. In one small trial, atenolol reduced the incidence of preeclampsia in women selected for increasedcardiac output. Of all b-blockers, the evidence that atenolol is associated with IUGR is the strongest, but appears to reflects excess maternal b-blockade, causing a decrease in cardiac output. Atenolol has also been used to treat congenital long QT syndrome during pregnancy. Side effects include CHF, bronchospasm, bradycardia, cold extremities, fatigue, nausea, rash, and hypotension. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Atenolol crosses the placenta. There is no substantive evidence of teratogenicity. As a group, b-blockers are associated with IUGR, though controversy continues as towhether this is drug or disease related. Atenolol reduces cardiac output, and failure to reduce the dose to prevent an excessive decline in output is associated with IUGR. Some rodent studies reveal a dose-dependent increase in embryo/fetalresorption. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Atenolol is concentrated in breast milk, and significant bradycardia may occur in newborns nursed by women onatenolol . It should probably be avoided. #Drug Interactions ................ Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine ) may have an additive effect when given with b-blocking agents. Calcium channel blockers may have an additive effect when given with atenolol . b-Blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension that can follow the withdrawal of clonidine . If the two drugs are given together, the b-blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine . If replacing clonidine with a b-blocker, the b-blocker should be delayed for several days after theclonidine has been stopped. Prostaglandin synthase-inhibiting drugs (e.g., indomethacin ) may decrease the hypotensive effects of b-blockers. Use of IV b-blockers and IV verapamil has resulted in serious adverse reactions, especially in patients with severecardiomyopathy, CHF, or recent MI. Patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a variety ofallergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic, while taking 65b-blockers. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses ofepinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction. #References 1998; 18:840-6.

Atorvastatin is also associated with the highest percentage of patients achieving their desired clinical targets. There is a single case report of atorvastatin use during pregnancy after inadvertent exposure. Though the outcome was normal, the safety of atorvastatin during pregnancy remains to be established. Side effects include rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhea, rash, myalgias, and elevated LFTs or CPK. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. While it is unknown whether atorvastatin crosses the human placenta, it crosses the rodent placenta. One review of 214 pregnancyexposures and 70 informative cases noted 31 adverse outcomes in 6622 neonates with structural defects, 4 with IUGR, and 5 fetal deaths. There were two principal groups of recurrent structural defects: cerivastatin andlovastatin were associated with 4 CNS defects; simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin were all associated with limb deficiencies, including 2 similar complex lower limb defects after simvastatin exposure. There were also 2 cases of VACTERL among the limb deficiency cases. All adverse outcomes were reported following exposure tocerivastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, oratorvastatin, which are lipophilic and should equilibrate between maternal and fetalcompartments. None were reported after exposure to pravastatin, which is poorly transported across the rodent placenta. Theseauthors suggest that statins may have secondary effects on sterol- dependent morphogens such as Sonic Hedgehog. Further study is necessary. Atorvastatin reaches fetal hepatic concentrations similar to maternal plasma. While there is no evidence of teratogenicity inrodents even at high doses, there is a dose-dependent increase in IUGR, a decrease in survival, and behavioral abnormalities that were gender-dependent. Rare structural defects have occasionallybeen reported in association with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. It is unknown whether atorvastatin enters human breast milk. However, its poor oral absorption and highdegree of protein binding suggest it is unlikely clinically relevantamounts will be found. Atorvastatin is excreted into the breast milk of rats. #Drug Interactions ................ Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decrease some 25% when colestipol andatorvastatin are given together. However, LDL-C reduction is greater with co-administration.Plasma digoxin concentrations increase by some 20% when given with atorvastatin . Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin increase some 40% with erythromycin, 30% and 20%, respectively.

The pharmacokinetics of atovaquone were recently determined in women with multidrug-resistant falciparummalaria treated by artesunate -atovaquone -proguanil during their 2nd and 3rd trimesters. The triple combination was well-tolerated and highly effective. The outcomes of pregnancy wereall normal. Population mean (\u00b1SEM) oral clearance (Cl/F)estimates were 313 \u00b1 33ml/h/kg and 1109 \u00b1 43ml/h/kg, 13.0 \u00b1 1.3l/kg and 22.9 29.1h and 14.3h for atovaquone and proguanil, respectively. Using conventional and population analyses, Cl/F and V d/F estimates foratovaquone and proguanil were 2 /C2and plasma concentrations <1=2those reported in healthy subjects and patients with acute malaria. This suggests the dose of atovaquone and proguanil should be increased for the treatment of malaria during pregnancy.

Atracurium is an intermediate-duration curare derivative producing effective surgical paralysis. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of atracurium in pregnant women. The clearance and clinical duration of atracurium are unaltered during pregnancy. In contrast, the clearance ofpancuronium is increased 27% during cesarean section, and the mean onset time and clinical duration of cisatracurium are significantly reduced.Side effects include CV collapse, tachycardia, hypotension, rash, flushing, and urticaria, all due to histamine release and hypertension. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Atracurium has been used in lieu of pancuronium to facilitate fetal procedures. While small amounts are shown to cross the human placenta, its use during cesareansection is not associated with neonatal sequelae. In theory, fetaltoxicity could be a risk if used for long-term paralysis of a critically ill pregnant woman. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. It is unknown whether atracurium enters human breast milk. Considering its application, atracurium is unlikely to affect the breastfeeding newborn. While somerodent studies report an increase in malformations, they are confounded by the profound respiratory depression associated with the drug. #Drug Interactions ................ Drugs that enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of atracurium include enflurane, isoflurane, and prior administration of succinylcholine does not enhance duration, but quickens the onset and possibly the depth ofneuromuscular blockade.

A purine analog Azathioprine is metabolized . There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of azathioprine in pregnant women. Immune-related disorders are fairly common in reproductive-age women. Women with quiescent inflammatorybowel disease are likely to have an uncomplicated pregnancy, whereas women with active disease are more likely to have complications such as spontaneous abortions, miscarriages,stillbirths, and exacerbation of the disease. Most pregnancies treated with azathioprine end successfully, even in transplant patients. It has been used successfully for the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis during pregnancy.Side effects include pancreatitis, fever, leukopenia, bone marrow suppression, immunosuppression, hepatotoxicity, risk ofneoplasm, diarrhea, pain, rash, increased LFTs,myalgias, and arthralgia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. Azathioprine crosses the human placenta; though the kinetics are unclear, it appears to reach equilibrium. The limited human experience (approximately 6 studies) is reassuring, and the drug should not be withheld if medically indicated. While no clearpattern of malformation is detectable in the large number ofpregnant women exposed, isolated skeletal defects are reported. All immunosuppressants cross the placenta, and their long-term impact on the child later in life is unknown. There are also reportsin neonates of reduced IgG and IgM, and leukopenia. It is unclearwhether the reported increase in IUGR reflects disease or drug. Heightened immune responses were reported during the pregnancy of a woman whose mother had been treated withazathioprine throughout pregnancy. Azathioprine is teratogenic in rodents treated with human-equivalent doses, producing a constellation of malformations that are both skeletal and visceral. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Azathioprine is excreted into breast milk, but the pharmacokinetics remain to be elucidated. In two women taking 75mg a day, the milk 6-mercaptopurine was<20mcg/L, suggesting the breastfed neonate would ingest <0.5% of the maternal dose. There are no well- documented instances of neonatal effect. #Drug Interactions ................ Allopurinol inhibits the principal pathway for azathioprine detoxification. Women receiving both agents should have theirdose of azathioprine reduced by 1=3to1=4the usual dose. Drugs that may affect leukocyte production, includingco-trimoxazole, may lead to exaggerated leukopenia, especially in renal transplant recipients. The use of ACEIs in patients on azathioprine may induce severe leukopenia. Azathioprine O'Grady 76Vroom F, de Walle HE, van de Laar MA, et al.

Interconceptional use of azithromycin plus metronidazole does not reduce the prevalence of preterm birth compared to placebo. Considering its efficacy against other STDs and convenient dosingregimen, azithromycin is probably the treatment of choice for Chlamydia. Single-dose azithromycin may be as effective as penicillin G for the treatment of early syphilis. Partner pharmacotherapy is cost-effective. Azithromycin has been used in combination with artesunate as malaria prophylaxis.

Betamethasone may increase the risk of maternal infection in women with PPROM, though most large studies reveal no increase. It can transiently cause an abnormal glucose tolerance test, will worsen existing diabetes mellitus, and is associated withpulmonary edema especially when given with a tocolytic agent inthe setting of an underlying infection. Side effects adrenal insufficiency and pulmonary edema. #Fetal Considerations ........... Betamethasone crosses the human placenta and is one of the few drugs proven to improve perinatal outcome. Some of thebeneficial effect on the lung may be lost if delivery occurs more than 14d after administration. Two courses more than a weekapart significantly reduces perinatal morbidity following pretermbirth. Outcomes at 2-3y of age after multiple courses are reassuring. About half of the drug is metabolized to inactive 11- ketosteroid derivatives. An increased risk of neonatal sepsis wassuggested but not confirmed. Multiple courses of betamethasone are not recommended. Adverse effects noted in animal andhuman studies are magnified by repeated courses of steroids.They include a profound suppression of fetal breathing andmovement, impaired myelination, IUGR, and microcephaly. Betamethasone is a potent agent, with at least short-term impact on a range of physiologic functions that include endocrine, immune, CV, and neurologic functions. The fetal heart ratepattern may become transiently nonreactive. Intellectual and motor development and school achievement are not adversely influenced by steroid treatment. Some suggest emotional stressduring organogenesis might cause congenital defects by increasing the level of endogenous cortisone. Epidemiologic studies report an association between oral clefting and exposure to corticosteroids during organogenesis. After controlling for 4confounding factors, it was concluded prenatal exposure increased 94the risk for cleft lip with or without cleft palate 6-fold. IUGR and shortening of the head and mandible are also suggested as sequelae of chronic steroid use during pregnancy, though it is difficult to separate drug from disease impact. The CollaborativePerinatal Project followed women treated during the 1st trimester. While the number of exposures was limited, no increase in congenital malformations was detected. There was no increase inrisk of anomalies when steroids were initiated after organogenesis.Women exposed to topical cortisone during pregnancy have no significant increase in birth defects. Female rats exposed tocortisone in utero exhibit premature vaginal opening. Cortisone accelerates fetal rat intestinal maturation, perhaps explaining whycorticosteroids decrease the incidence of NEC. In sum, the evidence that cortisone is a human teratogen is weak. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in breastfeeding women. Cortisone is present in human milk, but it is unclear whether maternal treatment with betamethasone increases the concentration. #Drug Interactions ................

Medical therapy with bromocriptine is the initial treatment of choice for infertility. When this is the primary indication for treatment, bromocriptine use has an extensive safety experience and is preferred by some clinicians. Indeed, most informationregarding bromocriptine during pregnancy comes from women treated for infertility with an average duration of exposure of 28d. No special maternal considerations are reported. Bromocriptine is used in many countries for the suppression of breast engorgement after delivery. However, rebound engorgement iscommon after cessation. In 1994, the FDA withdrew approval for that indication after a series of reports describing severe vasospastic events including stroke, MI, cerebral edema,convulsions, and puerperal psychosis. Recent reports suggest arole in the treatment of peripartal cardiomyopathy and SLE.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether budesonide crosses the human placenta. Epidemiologic study suggests budesonide is not a clinically significant teratogen. It appears, though, to cross themouse placenta, where budesonide increases fetal loss, IUGR, and malformations. Rodents as a group are more susceptible to steroids than humans. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether budesonide enters human breast milk. Considering <20% of the inhaled dose reaches the systemic circulation, it is unlikely clinically relevant concentrations willenter the breast milk and be absorbed orally. #Drug Interactions ................ The main route of metabolism of budesonide and other corticosteroids is via CYP3A4. The dose may need to be reducedwhen co-prescribing drugs primarily metabolized through CYP3A4,grapefruit or grapefruit juice should be avoided. Cimetidine, primarily an inhibitor of CYP1A2, slightly decreases budesonide clearance with a corresponding increase in oral bioavailability. #References The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists(ACOG) and The American College of Allergy, Asthma (ACAAI). should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if the benefit justifies the potential perinatal Panama); Burinax (Brazil); Burinex (Austria, Belgium, Canada, Costa Rica, Denmark, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, England, France, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Ireland, Malaysia, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Sweden, Switzerland, in loop of is no published experience with bumetanide during pregnancy.Side effects include renal failure, muscle cramps, impaired hearing, ECG changes, dry mouth, upset stomach,thrombocytopenia, vertigo, chest pain, and ototoxicity. #Fetal Considerations ...........

There is extensive information in the addiction medicine literature concerning the use of opioids in recovering pregnant addicts. Buprenorphine, methadone, andmorphine have been used to treat women seeking recovery from opioids, and closelymonitored neonatal outcomes have been reassuring. Side effects include respiratory depression and or arrest, hypotension, bradycardia, N/V, sedation, miosis, euphoria, hallucinations, vision, sweating, and constipation. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Buprenorphine crosses the human placenta poorly by a mechanism that does not involve P-glycoprotein. Themajority of newborns born to opioid-dependent women showsigns of opioid withdrawal. Buprenorphine substitution therapy has been used to prevent neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and poor neurodevelopmental outcome in these infants, and may be less severe than that with methadone, perhaps because of a low placental transfer rate. The NAS associated withbuprenorphine appears 12-48h after birth, peaks in 72-96h, and lasts for 120-168h. Time of last drug use and frequency of useduring the 3rd trimester are important factors associated withdrug-positive meconium specimens where concentrations may predict the onset and frequency of NAS. Buprenorphine has no apparent teratogenic effects. Some exposed children may present with transient motor abnormalities, though most probably resolvecompletely in 85% of cases. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursingwomen. Buprenorphine is excreted into human breast milk in low concentrations (peak 0.18ng/ml for buprenorphine and 0.20ng/ml for norbuprenorphine). In one woman, the daily amount ingestedby the neonate was very low ( <4mcg), and no withdrawal signs were noted after breastfeeding was abruptly interrupted. #Drug Interactions ................ Care should be taken if used in combination with CNSdepressant drugs.Care should be taken if used in combination with MAOIs. There are reports of respiratory and cardiovascular collapse in patients who received therapeutic doses of diazepam 111andbuprenorphine. There are a number of post-marketing reports of coma and death associated with the concomitant IV misuse of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines by addicts. In many cases, buprenorphine was misused by self-injection of crushed tablets.A suspected interaction between buprenorphine and phenprocoumon has been reported resulting in purpura. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity, such as macrolide may CYP inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, andphenytoin, induce may cause increased clearance of buprenorphine. #References .........................

Italso appears useful for the treatment of postpartum depression.Glaxo-Wellcome maintains an international registry to followwomen treated during pregnancy, and caregivers are encouraged to register treated patients. Side effects include arrhythmias, 3rd degree heart block, Stevens- Johnson syndrome, depression, rash, rhabdomyolysis, dysphagia,vaginal irritation, mania/hypomania, seizure, constipation, and confusion. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether bupropion crosses the human placenta. One prospective comparative study of 136 pregnant women taking bupropion conducted 4mo and 1y after delivery revealed no increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes except for anincrease in 1st trimester losses. Another study looked at 1200 1sttrimester exposures and concluded there was no increase incongenital malformations compared to control. Rodent studies too are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Bupropion is excreted into human breast milk, achieving M:P ratios of 2.5-8.6. However, the neonatal concentration was belowthe level of detection in the 3 newborns studied. Confirmatorystudies are needed. #Drug Interactions ................ Bupropion is primarily metabolized by CYP2B6 to hydroxybupropion. Thus, the potential exists for interactions withdrugs that affect CYP2B6 (e.g., orphenadrine, cyclophosphamide ). Though not well studied, some metabolism (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin ). Bupropion and hydroxybupropion are inhibitors in vitro. Many drugs, including most antidepressants (SSRIs metabolized by CYP2D6 and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range. The dose of an original medication metabolized by CYP2D6 may need to be reduced if bupropion is added. The acute toxicity of bupropion in animals is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine. Limited clinical data suggest a higher prevalence of adversereactions in patients taking bupropion with either levodopa or amantadine. Use small doses initially and increase gradually. Concurrent administration of bupropion XL tablets and agents that lower seizure threshold (e.g., antipsychotics, otherantidepressants, theophylline, systemic steroids) should be undertaken with extreme caution. Use small doses initially and increase gradually. There are rare reports of adverse neuropsychiatric events orreduced alcohol tolerance in patients drinking alcohol duringtreatment. Alcohol consumption should be avoided. 113Physiologic changes resulting from smoking cessation itself, with or without bupropion, may alter the pharmacokinetics of some concomitant medications. Blood concentrations of medicationsthat are extensively metabolized, such as theophylline and warfarin, may be expected to increase after smoking cessation due to the de-induction of liver enzymes. #References .........................

There is no published experience with buspirone during pregnancy. Buspirone interacts with numerous other drugs. Side effects include dizziness, N/V, insomnia, rash, headache, fatigue, dry mouth, diarrhea, decreased concentration, hostility, depression, blurred vision, diarrhea, abdominal pain, numbness, and weakness. 114#Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether buspirone crosses the human placenta. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing noevidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doseshigher than those used clinically. In vitro, buspirone reduces neuronal apoptosis after exposure to alcohol. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether buspirone enters human breast milk. Buspirone is excreted into rodent breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ It is recommended that buspirone notbe used concomitantly with MAOIs. After addition of buspirone to a diazepam dosing regimen, nordiazepam increased about 15% associated with minor adverse clinical effects (dizziness, headache, and nausea).Concomitant administration of buspirone andhaloperidol to healthy control subjects resulted in increased serum haloperidol concentrations. The clinical significance is not clear.The concomitant administration of buspirone with most other psychotropic drugs has not been studied; use with other CNS-active drugs should be approached cautiously.Buspirone is metabolized in vitro by CYP3A4. This finding is consistent with the in vivo interactions observed between buspirone and the following:Diltiazem and Verapamil one study, and C max5.5-fold and 4-fold, respectively). Adverse events tobuspirone may be more likely with either diltiazem or verapamil. Subsequent dose adjustment may be necessary. Erythromycin :In one study, administration of buspirone in C maxand 6-fold increase in AUC) in association with an increased incidence of side effects attributabletobuspirone. If the two drugs are to be used in combination, a low dose of buspirone (e.g., 2.5mg bid) is recommended. Subsequent dose adjustment of either drug should be based on clinical assessment. Grapefruit Juice: In one study, administration of buspirone (10mg as a single dose) with grapefruit juice (200ml double-strength tid for 2d) increased plasma buspirone (4.3-fold increase C max; 9.2-fold increase in AUC). Patients receiving buspirone should be advised to avoid drinking grapefruit juice. Itraconazole :In one study, administration of buspirone in C maxand 19-fold increase in AUC) in association with an increased incidence of side effects attributable to buspirone. If the two drugs are to be used in combination, a low dose of buspirone (e.g., 2.5mg qd) is recommended. Subsequent dose adjustment ofeither drug should be based on clinical assessment.Nefazodone :In one study, administration of buspirone (2.5 or 5mg bid) with nefazodone (250mg bid) increased plasma buspirone (increases up to 20-fold in C maxand up to 50-fold in AUC) and decreased (about 50%) plasma concentrations of metabolite 1-PP. Subjects asthenia, dizziness, and somnolence, adverse events also observedwith either drug alone. If the two drugs are to be used incombination, a low dose of buspirone (e.g., 2.5mg qd) is 115recommended. Subsequent dose adjustment of either drug should be based on clinical assessment. Rifampin :In one study, administration of buspirone (30mg as a single dose) with rifampin (600mg/day for 5d) decreased the plasma concentrations (83.7% decrease in C max; 89.6% decrease in AUC) and pharmacodynamic effects of buspirone. If the two drugs are to be used in combination, the dosage of buspirone may need adjusting to maintain anxiolytic effect. Other Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4: Substances that inhibit CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole orritonavir, may inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations, while substances that induce CYP3A4, such as dexamethasone or certain anticonvulsants ( ), may increase the rate of buspirone metabolism. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose adjustment of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. #References .........................

Itraconazole decreases busulfan clearance by up to 25%, and may produce AUCs >1500 mM/min in some patients. Phenytoin increases the clearance of busulfan by 15% or more, possibly due to the induction of glutathione-S-transferase.Because busulfan is eliminated from the body via glutathione conjugation, use of acetaminophen in the prior <72h or concurrently with busulfan may result in reduced clearance. Busulfan may cause additive myelosuppression when used with other myelosuppressive drugs.Bulsulfan -induced pulmonary toxicity may be additive to the effects of other cytotoxic agents.The concomitant use of metronidazole and high-dose busulfan may result in increased trough levels of busulfan and is not recommended. #References .........................

Butorphanol provides better initial analgesia than fentanyl during labor with fewer patient requests for more medication or epidural analgesia. In one well-designed study, it was less effective than meperidine for the relief of affective pain during labor. Acute psychosis has been reported after usage. Side effects include drowsiness, hypotension, respiratory depression, sedation, dizziness, N/V, sweating, headache,euphoria, confusion, nervousness, anorexia, and constipation. 118#Fetal Considerations ...........

When used concurrently with such drugs, the dose ofbutorphanol should be the smallest effective dose and the frequency of dosing reduced as much as possible.The analgesic effect of butorphanol may be diminished if given shortly after sumatriptan nasal spray. It is unknown if the effects of butorphanol are altered by other medications that affect hepatic metabolism of drugs(erythromycin, theophylline, etc.), but physicians should be alert to the possibility that a smaller initial dose and longer intervalsbetween doses may be needed. The fraction of butorphanol absorbed is unaffected by the concomitant administration of a nasal vasoconstrictor (oxymetazoline ), but the rate of absorption is decreased. Therefore, a slower onset can be anticipated. #References .........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Cabergoline is better tolerated and more effective in inducing a complete biochemical response thanbromocriptine. Women become pregnant in 1-37mo (mean 12.4mo) with cabergoline therapy. It has been used successfully throughout pregnancy to treat a macroprolactinoma; most tumors disappear with therapy. Cabergoline is also effective in women resistant or poorly responsive to bromocriptine. Prolactin typically trends lower after delivery or 3mo after breastfeeding.Cabergoline is used in several countries to prevent postpartum lactation (1mg PO /C21) or block /C24). Side effects include N/V, headache, dizziness, constipation, fatigue, abdominal pain, vertigo, hot flashes, dry mouth, depression, and hypotension. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether cabergoline crosses the human placenta. First trimester exposure is not associated with adverse perinatal outcome. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

There is no clear evidence caffeine at moderate ingestion levels has an adverse effect on pregnancy. Toxicity occurs only in veryhigh dosages (e.g., 25 tablets of Fiorinal [ ASA, butalbital, caffeine]). Side effects include tachycardia and anxiety. In combination with other drugs, caffeine it may cause anaphylaxis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, bone marrow suppression, GI bleeding, and Stevens- Johnson syndrome. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Caffeine crosses the placenta, achieving an F:M ratio near unity. Cardiac arrhythmias are associated with maternal caffeine use in excess of 500mg/d. There is no substantive evidence that caffeine is either a teratogen or causes IUGR in humans. In rodents, high and sustained doses are associated witha small increase in the prevalence of cleft palate. Despite the fact that many epidemiologic studies observed a positive associationbetween maternal caffeine intake and the risk of spontaneous abortion, the evidence is still equivocal given the biases likely present and the fact that most of the potential biases would overestimate any association. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Though it enters human breast milk in small amounts, caffeine is generally considered safe for breastfeeding women. #Drug Interactions ................

Patients on diuretics (especially if recently initiated), as well as those on severe dietary salt restriction or dialysis, may experience a precipitous drop in BP typically within an hour of receiving the initial dose of captopril. Proactive steps to avoid hypotension include discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake approximately 1w prior to initiating captopril or initiating therapy with small doses (6.25 or 12.5mg). If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position and, ifnecessary, receive an IV infusion of normal saline. Transient hypotension is not a contraindication to further doses. Nitroglycerin or other nitrates (as used for management of angina) or other drugs having vasodilator activity should, ifpossible, be discontinued before starting captopril. If resumed during captopril therapy, such agents should be given cautiously, perhaps at a lower dose.Enhanced by antihypertensive agents that cause renin release (e.g.,thiazides). Agents affecting sympathetic activity (e.g., ganglionic blocking agents or adrenergic neuron blocking agents) should be used withcaution. b-Adrenergic blocking agents are somewhat additive to captopril, but the overall response is less than the individual sum. Serum potassium may rise since captopril decreases aldosterone production. Potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone, triamterene, oramiloride, or potassium supplements, should be given only for documented hypokalemia, and then with caution.Salt substitutes containing potassium should also be used withcaution. Indomethacin may reduce the antihypertensive effect, especially in cases of low-renin hypertension. Other NSAIDs (e.g., aspirin ) may have this effect.Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of toxicity are reported in patients receiving lithium and ACEI therapy. These drugs should be co-administered with caution. J Med 2006; 354:2443-51.

Anticonvulsant drugs should not be discontinued abruptly during pregnancy if used to prevent seizures, as there is a significant possibility of precipitating status epilepticus. There are noadequate reports or well-controlled studies of carbamazepine in pregnant women. It would seem advisable for women to continue medication during pregnancy using monotherapy at the lowest dose required to achieve seizure control. Polytherapy would seembest avoided where possible.Side effects include seizures, arrhythmias, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and hepatitis. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Carbamazepine rapidly crosses the human placenta and accumulates in fetal organs, including the brain. Epidemiologic study suggests carbamazepine is a teratogen causing facial dysmorphism, spina bifida, distal phalange hypoplasia, and developmental delay. In prospective studies involving 1255 exposures, carbamazepine was associated with increased rates of neural tube, CV, urinary tract, and cleft palateanomalies. One overview (Cochrane) concluded the evidence is weak that carbamazepine is a teratogen as monotherapy. More recent epidemiologic evidence, however, concludes carbamazepine is a modest teratogen\u2014less than phenytoin, but more than other anticonvulsant agents. The combination of carbamazepine with other antiepileptic drugs has a synergistic effect on the prevalence of birth defects. There is also concern thatcarbamazepine exposure increases the risk of neonatal intracranial hemorrhage. Rodent #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Carbamazepine is excreted in human breast milk. Although it is generally considered safe for breastfeeding women, neonatalsequelae reported include cholestatic hepatitis. The infant should 133be monitored for possible adverse effects, the drug given at the lowest effective dose, and breastfeeding avoided at times of peak drug levels. #Drug Interactions ................ Carbamazepine suspension should not be used with other liquid medicinal agents or diluents. Mixing it with either chlorpromazine solution or liquid thioridazine causes a precipitate. CYP3A4 inhibitors inhibit carbamazepine metabolism and may increase plasma levels. Drugs that have been shown, or would beexpected, to increase patient has been on a stable dosage of carbamazepine and begins treatment with one of these inhibitors, it is reasonable to expect a dose reduction in carbamazepine may be necessary.CYP3A4 inducers can increase carbamazepine metabolism. Drugs that have been shown, or would be expected, to decreasecarbamazepine hepatic CYP activity (especially CYP3A4 or epoxidehydrolase) and either causes or would be expected to cause decreased levels increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects.Altered thyroid function has been reported when combined with other anticonvulsant medications. Breakthrough bleeding has been reported in women receiving oraland subdermal implant contraceptives, and their reliability may be adversely affected. Phenytoin has been reported to increase. Careful monitoring of phenytoin after use with carbamazepine is advised. Warfarin's anticoagulant effect may be reduced by carbamazepine.Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used whencarbamazepine is taken with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol. #References .........................

Patients treated with carteolol plus a catecholamine-depleting agent must be observed carefully for evidence of hypotension and/or excessive bradycardia, which may cause syncope or postural hypotension.General anesthetics may exaggerate the hypotension.NSAIDs may blunt the antihypertensive effect of b-blockers. Calcium antagonists may be used with b-adrenergic blocking agents when heart function is normal, but should be avoided inwomen with impaired cardiac function. Hypotension is morelikely when the calcium antagonist is a dihydropyridine derivative (e.g., nifedipine ), while LV failure and AV conduction disturbances are more likely with either verapamil ordiltiazem. Use with digitalis and either IV diltiazem orverapamil may have additive effects in prolonging AV conduction time. Use with oral antidiabetic agents or insulin may be associatedwith hypoglycemia or possibly hyperglycemia. The dose of thehypoglycemic agent should be adjusted accordingly. Carteolol solution should be used with caution in women receiving an oral b-adrenergic blocking agent because of the potential for additive effects. #References .........................

Patients taking a drug with b-blocking properties and a one that can deplete catecholamines (e.g., reserpine, MAOIs) should be observed closely for signs of hypotension and/or severe bradycardia.Clonidine may potentiate the antihypertensive effects of b-blocking agents. If the clonidine is to be terminated, the b-blocking agent should be discontinued first over several days. Mean trough cyclosporine levels are increased after carvedilol treatment in renal transplant patients suffering from chronic vascular rejection. In about 30%, the cyclosporine dose has to be reduced. Due to wide interindividual variability, it isrecommended that cyclosporine concentrations be monitored closely after initiation of carvedilol therapy. Digoxin concentrations are increased by about 15%. Both digoxin andcarvedilol slow AV conduction. Therefore, increased monitoring of digoxin is recommended when initiating, adjusting, or discontinuing carvedilol. Rifampin reduced plasma concentrations by about 70%. Cimetidine increased AUC by about 30% but caused no change in C max. 141Isolated cases of conduction disturbance (rarely with hemodynamic compromise) have been observed when carvedilol is co-administered with diltiazem. b-Blocking drugs may enhance oral hypoglycemics. #References .........................

Pregnancy Category: BLactation Category: S/C15Cefuroxime is a reasonable candidate for the noted indications. /C15The high degree of placental transfer renders cefuroxime a potentially attractive agent for (Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Israel, Nicaragua, Panama, Uruguay); Celebrex (Canada, Colombia, England, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Korea, Mexico, Philippines, Singapore, bid asthma, aspirin triad, hepatic and failure /C15Caution \u2014nasal polyps, GI bleeding, renal or hepatic dysfunction, CHF, hypertension, dehydration, fluid retention, asthma #Maternal Considerations ..... Celecoxib is the prototype COX-2 inhibitor. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 170In vitro studies reveal inhibition of uterine contractions by COX- 2 inhibition. In two small trials, celecoxib was employed as a tocolytic agent with modest effect. Celecoxib (80 and 160mg/kg/ d) significantly reduces fertility, prolongs pregnancy, and inhibits normal cervical ripening in rats. The authors concluded it was similar to indomethacin but with a lower frequency of adverse fetal effects. However, in a series of recent studies, COX-2 inhibition was associated with a dose-related increase in deathfrom CV causes, MI, stroke, or heart failure. In light of these reports, celecoxib use should be avoided for most indications in favor of other agents especially in women with CV and GI risks. Side effects include GI bleeding, GI ulceration, esophagitis, hypersensitivity reaction, bronchospasm, heart failure, hepatic toxicity, renal necrosis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, dizziness, and pharyngitis. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Celecoxib crosses the human placenta, as do other NSAIDs, and can cause ductus arteriosus constriction late in pregnancy. Fetal levels are dependent on the maternal concentrations because NSAID agents are not metabolized by the fetal kidney. It reduces renal blood and urine flows in the ovinefetus. Celecoxib increases the incidence of VSD and other fetal alterations such as fused ribs and misshapen sternum in rabbits treated during organogenesis. There is a dose-dependent increase in the frequency of diaphragmatic hernia in rats. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of celecoxib in nursing women. A single case report found a concentration of 133ng/ml approximately 5h after a 100mg dose and an elimination t/2 of 4.0-6.5h. If this level were sustained, the amount ingested by a 3.5kg newborn in 24h should be Interactions ................ Celecoxib is metabolized by hepatic CYP2C9. Drugs known to inhibit 2C9 should be given cautiously.Celecoxib inhibits in vitro CYP2D6 activity. Thus, there is a potential for an in vivo drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACEIs. Administration of aspirin with celecoxib increases the rate of GI ulceration and other complications compared to celecoxib alone. Celecoxib is not a substitute for aspirin for CV prophylaxis. Fluconazole increases celecoxib plasma concentrations by 2-fold. This increase is due to the inhibition of celecoxib metabolism by CYP2C9. NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. Lithium levels are increased approximately 17%. Patients on lithium should be closely monitored when celecoxib is introduced or withdrawn.Bleeding events have been reported post-marketing in patientsreceiving celecoxib in Gynecol2001; Contraception 2002; 65:373-8.Stika CS, and other COX-2 inhibitors may be associated with an excess of CV mortality, and their use should probably be confined to secondary or tertiary treatment. /C15Celecoxib should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if the benefit justifies the Republic,Ecuador, England, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Philippines, Portugal, South Africa, Spain,Switzerland, Germany, Ireland); Keflex(Austria, Bulgaria, Colombia, Denmark, England, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Norway, Peru,Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand); Kefloridina Africa); Ospexin (Austria, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, El Salvador,Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nicaragua, 172/C15Caution dysfunction, antibiotic- associated colitis #Maternal Considerations .....

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Cephalexin crosses the human placenta in a carrier-mediated fashion. The magnitude of transfer is greater than cephapirin, and produces a fetal concentration above the MIC for most sensitive pathogens. There is no evidence of teratogenicity. Rodent studies are also reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doseshigher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Most cephalosporins are excreted into breast milk, but theamount of cephalexin excreted is small and generally considered compatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................

The available information is insufficient to determine whether the potential benefits of benzodiazepines to the mother outweigh the risks to the fetus.High peak concentrations are avoided by dividing the daily dosage into 2 or 3 doses. Side effects include agranulocytosis, drowsiness, ataxia, confusion, rash, edema, menstrual extrapyramidal effects. #Fetal Considerations ........... Benzodiazepines are rapidly transferred across the placenta during early and late pregnancy, and 1st trimester exposure to this class of drugs has been linked to an increased risk of anomalies. While there are no well-controlled studies of chlordiazepoxide in human fetuses, the overall experience has been reassuring. Insome 550 children followed up to 4y, there was no increase in either malformations or adverse effects on neurobehavioral development and IQ. Some infants exposed in the 3rd trimesterexhibit either the floppy infant syndrome or marked neonatal withdrawal symptoms. Symptoms vary from mild sedation, hypotonia, and reluctance to suck to apneic spells, cyanosis, andimpaired metabolic responses to cold stress, and may persist forhours to months after birth. This correlates with the pharmacokinetic and placental transfer of the benzodiazepines and their disposition in the neonate. Chlordiazepoxide retards motor development and physical maturation in mice. Rodentstudies reveal no increased risk of congenital anomalies, IUGR, or adverse effects on lactation. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of chlordiazepoxide in nursing women.

Chloroquine is closely related to hydroxychloroquine and has similar uses. A body of clinical experience suggests chloroquine is safe during pregnancy and improves outcome in women with active disease. In one study of 96 women with active malaria,chloroquine (10mg/kg) was given at time 0 and 24h and again at 48h (5mg/kg). The T maxafter the first dose was 3.5h, whereas plasma concentrations (CP max) at 2, 28, and 52h were 204.36, 343.51, and 257.04ng/ml respectively. There was total parasitemiaclearance before the end of 96h in all the subjects. In another study, the conversion of chloroquine to its major metabolite, desethylchloroquine, was increased in the 3rd trimester, suggesting the need for caution when considering the use of higher doses.Current study suggests there are more effective treatment options. Chloroquine is also used as an adjunct for the treatment of SLE in women who have failed to respond to first-line agents. Recent studies suggest it may have a role in the treatment of HIV, and thus may have a role in HIV-infected breastfeeding women. While prolonged treatment with quinine-type drugs is associated withpigmentary retinopathy, the risk is not increased during pregnancy.Side effects include agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, aplastic approximating 0.7-0.8. Fetal retinopathy was noted in some animalstudies, but more recent investigation casts doubt on the associationand suggests it is safe during the 1st trimester. No increase in spontaneous abortion or major birth defects is reported in humans. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Chloroquine enters human breast milk, achieving an M:P ratio ranging from 0.268 to 0.462. Some studies suggest it may actuallybe concentrated. However, it is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Antacids and kaolin may reduce absorption; an interval of at least 4h between intake of these agents should be observed. Cimetidine inhibits chloroquine metabolism, increasing its plasma level. In a study of healthy volunteers, chloroquine reduced ampicillin bioavailability. Wait at least 2h between drugs. Chloroquine may increase cyclosporine levels. Monitor 2004; 9:601-5.

Though popular among obstetricians for the treatment of edema and weight gain in the 1970s, there are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of chlorothiazide in pregnant women. Physiologic edema should not be treated. Thiazide diuretics may be diabetogenic. Severe electrolyte imbalances in both mother andnewborn are reported. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis is also reported after thiazide exposure. Side effects include renal failure, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypomagnesemia, glucose intolerance, hyperlipidemia, andphotosensitivity. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Thiazide diuretics readily cross the placenta.There is no clear evidence chlorothiazide increases the risk of malformation. However, older studies suggest thiazide diureticsmay decrease placental perfusion by preventing normal plasmaexpansion and increase the risk of IUGR. Thrombocytopenia and hypoglycemia are major risks. The mechanism for the thrombocytopenia is unknown. Fetal bradycardia followingexposure is the imbalance (hypokalemia). #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Thiazide diuretics enter human breast milk in low concentrations.While there are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women, they are generally considered compatible withbreastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................

Though there are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses, epidemiologic study suggests chlorpheniramine is not a human teratogen. It is unknown whetherchlorpheniramine crosses the human placenta. However, H 1 receptors are specifically expressed in syncytiotrophoblast cells of human placenta. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doseshigher than those used clinically. In rodents, chlorpheniramine stimulates glycosaminoglycan leading malformation. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience with chlorpheniramine in nursing women.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of chlorpropamide in pregnant women. Current study suggests that some modern oral hypoglycemic drugs are safe and useful, notonly later in pregnancy but also in the 1st trimester, providingexcellent control of blood glucose. The treatment of women withgestational diabetes after delivery does not appear to alter the timing or reduce the ultimate frequency of type II diabetes. Chlorpropamide and other sulfonylureas may provoke an antabuse -like reaction if the patient consumes alcohol. There are alternative agents with minimal placental transport that are better candidates for maternal therapy. Older reports note its use for diabetes insipidus. Presently, DDAVP is preferred for this indication.Side Chlorpropamide crosses the placenta and has a long t/2. It significantly reduces birth weight and perinatal mortality in theoffspring of diabetic women without increasing the incidence ofbirth defects. More recent studies suggest that some oral hypoglycemic agents are relatively safe during pregnancy with no increased risk of macrosomia, hypoglycemia, and lung 193immaturity, though there are alternative agents with less placental transfer. Rodent teratogenicity studies have not been conducted. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... While there are no adequate studies in nursing mothers,chlorpropamide enters the breast milk, achieving an M:P ratio of 0.2, and neonatal hypoglycemia has been reported. #Drug Interactions ................ Hypoglycemia may be potentiated by NSAIDs and other drugsthat are highly protein bound, as sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blockingdrugs, and isoniazid may decrease the hypoglycemic effect. Observe closely for hypoglycemia when such drugs are withdrawnfrom a patient receiving chlorpropamide. Barbiturates may be prolonged by therapy with chlorpropamide.

Cholestyramine is the chloride salt of a basic anion exchange resin that is not systemically absorbed, but could interfere withthe uptake of fat-soluble vitamins. Cholestyramine is used by some for the treatment of cholestasis of pregnancy, but itsefficacy has long been questioned. The only randomized trialcompared it to ursodeoxycholic acid . The results demonstrated cholestyramine was inferior for the relief of prutitus and was associated with worse pregnancy outcomes.Side effects include severe constipation, flatulence, gastric pain, anorexia, dyspepsia, headache, rash, fatigue, and weight loss. 197#Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Cholestyramine is not systemically absorbed, but could interfere with the uptake of fat-soluble vitamins. Rodentstudies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of infertility,increased pregnancy loss, teratogenicity, or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience with cholestyramine in nursing women. The resin is not absorbed from the maternal gut andthus is not secreted into breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ May delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral agents such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics estrogens and progestins, anddigitalis.May interfere with the pharmacokinetics of drugs that undergo enterohepatic circulation. The discontinuance of cholestyramine could pose a hazard if a potentially toxic drug such as digitalis has been titrated to a maintenance level while the patient wastaking cholestyramine.

The published experience with cidofovir during pregnancy is limited to a single case report. Its use was associated with breast adenocarcinoma in female rats. Side effects include neutropenia, renal failure, uveitis, N/V, anorexia, and anemia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether cidofovir crosses the human placenta. However, it was used successfully in a guinea pig model to prevent congenital CMV. Rodent studies conducted at doses below the MRHD revealed maternal toxicity andembryotoxicity associated with skeletal malformations. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether cidofovir enters human breast milk. Breastfeeding is contraindicated in HIV-infected nursing womenwhere formula is available to reduce the risk of neonatal transmission. #Drug Interactions ................ The pharmacokinetics of zidovudine were evaluated in 10 patients receiving zidovudine alone or with IV cidofovir (without probenecid ). There was no evidence of an effect of cidofovir on the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine. Probenecid is known to interact with the metabolism or renal tubular excretion of many drugs assessed.Concomitant administration of cidofovir and agents with nephrotoxic potential (e.g., amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, be used during pregnancy and lactation only if the benefit justifies the potential perinatal risk. /C15Physicians are encouraged to register pregnant women under the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (1-800-258-4263) for a better follow-up of the outcome while under treatment with Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Denmark,Dominican Republic, El Salvador, England, France, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Indonesia,Ireland, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, \u2014unknown #Maternal Considerations ..... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of cimetidine in pregnant women, and evidence documenting the safety of acid-suppressing drugs during pregnancy is very limited.Antacids and antacid/alginic acid combinations or sucralfate constitute first-line medical therapy. If the symptoms are notadequately relieved or if complications develop, treatment with cimetidine orranitidine may be considered. The treatment of ''heartburn'' with cimetidine is not followed by significant maternal adverse reactions. Drugs that inhibit hepatic microsomal enzymes, such as cimetidine, may promote the accumulation of unexpectedly high (possibly toxic) blood concentrations oflidocaine. Cimetidine has some antiandrogenic effect. Side effects include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and hepatic failure. 201#Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of cimetidine in human fetuses. Studies conducted in pregnant subjects found no relation between drug exposure and birth defects.However, one large epidemiologic investigation noted a possibleassociation between preterm birth and 1 sttrimester exposure to H 2 antagonists. Further study seems warranted. Rodent studies revealinhibition of both testicular descent and genital differentiation andpostnatal cryptorchidism. These events might occur in humanfetuses when high doses of cimetidine are administered to pregnant women around the end of the 1st trimester. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Cimetidine enters human breast milk and is actively transported by BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein).The percentage of the maternal dose ingested based on neonatalbody weight is <10%, which should be safe under normal conditions. However, the excretion of alternative agents such as famotidine andnizatidine is even lower. #Drug Interactions ................ metabolism lidocaine, theophylline, andmetronidazole. The dose of these drugs and other similarly metabolized drugs, particularly those of low therapeutic ratio or in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment, may require adjustment when starting or stopping cimetidine.

They should be Ruigomez A, Am JEpidemiol 1999; 150:476-81.Staud F, Ther sucralfateconstitute first-line medical therapy. /C15If symptoms are not adequately relieved or if complicationsdevelop, treatment with cimetidine orranitidine may be considered. Cinoxacin and Enterobacter species 202#Mechanism \u2014not known #Maternal Considerations ..... There is no published experience with cinoxacin during pregnancy. Side effects include skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, edema, angioedema, eosinophilia, itching, redness, swelling, dizziness,headache, of skin to sunlight, andthrombocytopenia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofcinoxacin in human fetuses. The use of the new quinolones during the 1st trimester of pregnancy is not associated with an increased prevalence of malformations or musculoskeletal problems; however, longer follow-up and MRI of the joints maybe warranted to exclude subtle cartilage and bone damage. Whilerodent studies did not reveal evidence of teratogenicity, cinoxacin was associated with bone development abnormalities in younganimals. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether cinoxacin enters human breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ There is little specific information on cinoxacin. Other quinolones may prolong the elimination t/2 of theophylline and increase serum levels. Some quinolones reduce the clearance of caffeine and prolong its serum t/2. Multivalent tablets or pediatric powder, other highly buffered drugs, orproducts containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease quinolone absorption. Some quinolones variably alter phenytoin levels. Some quinolones are associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine when given with cyclosporine. Quinolones may enhance the effects of warfarin. Probenecid interferes with renal tubular secretion of quinolones. Some quinolones may inhibit renal tubular transport ofmethotrexate, leading to increased levels of methotrexate. NSAIDs (but not aspirin ), in combination with very high doses of quinolones, have been shown to provoke convulsions in preclinical studies. #References ......................... Bardi M, Manzoni A.

Fluoroquinolone therapy is widely used as a treatment for gonorrhea because it is a relatively inexpensive, oral, and single-dose therapy. However, fluoroquinolone-resistant disease is being identified more frequently. A test for cure is essential. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnantwomen. Ciprofloxacin is also usually selected when penicillin- class agents have no effect on gram-negative rods. Ciprofloxacin has the best safety profile of second-line drugs for drug-resistanttuberculosis. It is the drug of choice for prophylaxis amongasymptomatic pregnant women exposed to B. anthracis. In instances where the strain is penicillin-sensitive, prophylaxis with amoxicillin, 500mg tid /C260d, may be considered. Isolates of B. anthracis implicated in the recent bioterrorist attacks are susceptible to penicillin in laboratory tests, but may contain penicillinase activity. Penicillins are not recommended for 204treatment of anthrax. Ciprofloxacin has also been used to treat Q fever during pregnancy. Side effects include seizures, pseudomembranous colitis, psychosis, hypersensitivity, N/V, dizziness, rash, increased CK levels, arthropathy elevated hepatic enzymes. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Ciprofloxacin crosses the human placenta, and can be found in AF in low quantities. The mean transplacental transfer percentage of ciprofloxacin across the isolated perfused human cotyledon approximates 3.2% and the transplacental transfer index (the ratio of transplacental transfer between ciprofloxacin and antipyrine) was 0.34. Short-duration treatment with ciprofloxacin appears free of adverse fetal responses. As a class, the new quinolones do not appear associated with an increased risk of malformation or musculoskeletal problems in humans. The effect of prolonged exposure such as that requiredfor Crohn's disease or anthrax prophylaxis remains unknown. Longer follow-up and MRI of the joints may be warranted to exclude subtle cartilage and bone damage. There are no clinicallysignificant musculoskeletal dysfunctions reported in childrenexposed to fluoroquinolones in utero. Treatment of fetal mice, dogs, and rabbits with other quinolones is associated with anacute arthropathy of the weight-bearing joints. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in lactating human mothers. Ciprofloxacin enters human breast milk, and oral doses of this drug are concentrated in breast milk at levels higher than serum. C. difficile pseudomembranous colitis has been reported in a breastfed neonate whosemother was taking ciprofloxacin. In some animals, slow ciprofloxacin elimination results in blood levels out of proportion to that ingested. Though the American Academy of Pediatrics considers it safe for breastfeeding women, it is probably best to avoid ciprofloxacin when there are reasonable alternatives. #Drug Interactions ................ May prolong the elimination t/2 of theophylline and increase the risk of theophylline -related adverse reactions. May reduce the clearance of caffeine and prolong its serum t/2. or pediatric powder, other highly buffered drugs, orproducts containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease ciprofloxacin absorption. May variably alter phenytoin levels. Use with glyburide has, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia.Has been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving cyclosporine. May enhance the effects of warfarin. Probenecid interferes with renal tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin and will increase the serum level. May inhibit renal tubular transport of methotrexate, leading to increased levels of methotrexate. Metoclopramide accelerates the absorption of oral ciprofloxacin, resulting in shorter time to peak maximum plasmaconcentrations.NSAIDs (but not aspirin ) may provoke convulsions when used with very high doses of quinolones. 205#References .........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of cisapride in pregnant women. Antacids and antacid/alginic acid combinations or sucralfate constitute first-line medical therapy. 206Cisapride is reserved for patients with severe symptoms. Rodent studies suggest decreased fertility after exposure to cisapride. Side effects include severe arrhythmias (torsades de pointes), pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hepatic failure, headache, N/V, fatigue, and depression. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether cisapride crosses the human placenta. There were no differences in maternal history, birth weight, gestational age at delivery, and rates of live births, spontaneous or therapeutic abortions, fetal distress, and major orminor malformations among the group of pregnant womenexposed to cisapride; 3=4of exposures occurred during organogenesis. Cisapride rapidly crosses the placenta, with an average F:M ratio of 0.71. Embryotoxicity was noted at dosesthat were multiples of the MRHD. However, a rat study notedthe occurrence of a fetal arrhythmia associated with an increased prevalence of malformations. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Cisapride enters human breast milk, but at low concentrations of 6ng/ml. Thus, the amount ingested by the neonate is likely without clinical effect. #Drug Interactions ................ Cisapride is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4. Ingestion a inhibitor can prolongation of the QT interval.Anticholinergic compounds, such as belladonna and dicyclomine, would be expected to compromise the beneficial effects of cisapride. Furosemide and the thiazides are associated with depletion of electrolytes, which may lead to cisapride -induced cardiac arrhythmias.Cimetidine but not ranitidine increase the peak cisapride concentration and AUC.Grapefruit juice increases the bioavailability of cisapride by an average of 50%.Should not be used with drugs known to prolong the QTinterval: certain antiarrhythmics, including those of class IA (e.g., quinidine andprocainamide ) and class III (e.g., sotalol ); TCAs (e.g., amitriptyline ); certain tetracyclic antidepressants (e.g., ); certain antipsychotic medications (e.g., sertindole ); bepridil, andsparfloxacin. The acceleration of gastric emptying by cisapride could affect the rate of absorption of other drugs. Patients receiving narrow therapeutic ratio drugs or other drugs that require carefultitration should be followed closely. #References ......................... Bailey B, Addis A, Lee A, et al.

Cisatracurium Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Uruguay); CV ..... Atracurium is an intermediate-duration curare derivative producing effective surgical paralysis. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of cisatracurium in pregnant women. The clearance and clinical duration of atracurium are unaltered during pregnancy. In contrast, the clearance of pancuronium is increased 27% during cesarean section, and the mean onset time and clinical duration of cisatracurium are significantly reduced.Side effects include CV collapse, tachycardia, hypotension, rash, flushing, and urticaria, all due to histamine release and hypertension. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofcisatracurium in human fetuses. Atracurium has been used in lieu of pancuronium to facilitate fetal procedures. While small amounts are shown to cross the human placenta, its use during cesarean section is not associated with neonatal sequelae. In theory, if used for long-term paralysis of a critically ill pregnant woman, fetal toxicity could be a risk. In cell culture,cisatracurium increases the rates of HUVEC apoptosis. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. It is unknown whether cisatracurium enters human breast milk. Considering its application, cisatracurium is unlikely to affect the breastfeeding newborn. While some rodentstudies report an increase in malformations, they are confoundedby the profound respiratory depression associated with the drug. #Drug Interactions ................ Isoflurane orenflurane administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC may prolong the clinically effective duration 208of action of cisatracurium. The average infusion rate requirement may be decreased by as much as 30-40%.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Patients should be advised to avoid pregnancyduring treatment. The published literature consists mostly of case reports and small series. Good outcomes are possible. Cisplatin has been used during pregnancy for women discovered to have ovarian or other malignancies. Pregnancy and fetal age impact on cisplatin protein binding because of lower albumin levels. The resulting higher levels of free drug in the mother and fetus may increase the risk of toxicity in both. Cisplatin causes severe mitochondrial toxicity in the maternal rat kidney. 209Side effects include nephrotoxity, ototoxicity, neuropathy, optic paresthesia, ataxia, elevated hepatic enzymes, rash, urticaria, muscle weakness, and loss of taste. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Cisplatin crosses the human placenta. Low fetal protein concentration increases the percentage of free drug.Malformations in offspring of women treated with cisplatin are rare. Cisplatin is embryotoxic and teratogenic in mice. Damage to the fetal renal and hepatic mitochondria as a result oftransplacental drug exposure appears mild. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Cisplatin enters human breast milk at concentrations at or below the level of detection, and is generally considered compatible withbreastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ May be associated with decreased plasma levels of anticonvulsants. #References ......................... Ben-Baruch G, Menczer J, Natl Cancer Inst 1992; 84:451-2. da la Motte Rouge P, et al.

Depression is an important and often unrecognized problem during pregnancy and the puerperium. Pregnancy is not a reason to discontinue therapy. Pregnancy increases the metabolism ofcitalopram necessitating an increasing dose to maintain effect. Side effects include nephrotoxity, ototoxicity, neuropathy, optic neuritis, seizures, anemia, hypokalemia, and hypoglycemia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Citalopram crosses the human placenta, achieving an F:M ratio approximating 0.66, higher than either sertraline or paroxetine. Several recent epidemiologic studies note an association between 1st trimester SSRI use (most often paroxetine ) and CV defects. The concern is great enough the ACOG has suggested caregivers avoid paroxetine in the 1st trimester. The use of antidepressants in early pregnancy does not seem to carry significant risk for the human infant during the newborn period. While the clinical reports are generally reassuring, neonatalwithdrawal syndrome has been reported after 3rd trimesterexposure. Rodent studies reveal CV and skeletal defects. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Citalopram enters human breast milk, but the neonatal concentration is very low and likely poses no thr eat to breastfeeding neonates. #Drug Interactions ................ Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role inhemostasis. Epidemiologic studies reveal an association betweenSSRIs and the occurrence of upper GI bleeding that is potentiatedby NSAID or aspirin use.

Clarithromycin is used for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections, GU tract infections, skin infections, neutropenicpatients, AIDS-related infections, acute maxillary sinusitis, andactive duodenal ulcer. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It has been suggested that H. pylori infection might be a cause of persistent hyperemesis gravidarum. Clarithromycin has also been used successfully for the treatment of Q fever, Mediterranean spotted fever and MACduring pregnancy. Studies in rats, rabbits, and monkeys indicate clarithromycin does not impair fertility. Side effects include anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, arrhythmia, pseudomembranous colitis, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, headache, and rash. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Clarithromycin crosses the human placenta to a greater degree than other macrolides (6% maternal dose), makingit a candidate in treatment trials of genital Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma infections during pregnancy. Post-marketing studies are reassuring. No teratogenic effects are noted in most studies of 212rats, rabbits, and monkeys. However, there are reports of a modest increase in CV malformations and cleft palate in certain rodent strains. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

Because of its antimicrobial spectrum, clindamycin is used for the treatment of serious infections caused by anaerobes, 216respiratory tract infections, postpartum endometritis, pneumonitis, and soft tissue infections caused by streptococci and staphylococci. Clindamycin is a popular drug for the treatment of acne in reproductive-age women. Higher doses of clindamycin should be used during pregnancy, as its t/2 in maternal serumappears shorter during pregnancy. When combined with gentamicin in patients with PPROM, there is a significant reduction in the incidence of histologic chorioamnionitis, but notthe frequency of funisitis. Oral clindamycin cures BV in 90% and maintains a normal flora in 2=3of treated women throughout pregnancy. The literature is unclear whether clindamycin vaginal gel reduces the incidence of preterm delivery in women withBV\u2014there are randomized trials to support either conclusion. It is the antibiotic of choice for prophylaxis for neonatal group B streptococcal sepsis in patients allergic to penicillin, though thereis growing resistance.Side effects include diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, anaphylaxis, N/V, rash, and jaundice. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Clindamycin crosses the human placenta, achieving fetal levels above the typical MICs. There are no reports linking clindamycin with fetal malformations. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofclofibrate in pregnant women. Clofibrate typically reduces serum cholesterol a modest amount and serum triglycerides somewhat more. Substantial reductions in cholesterol and triglycerides canoccur in type III hyperlipidemia. No study has shown a convincing reduction in fatal MI. There is little information on the effect of clofibrate on cholesterol metabolism during human pregnancy. For that reason, women of childbearingpotential taking clofibrate should use effective contraception. In patients who plan to become pregnant, clofibrate should be withdrawn several months before conception if deemed medicallysafe.Side effects include mild abdominal and bowel irritation, myalgia, increased gallstones, ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether clofibrate crosses the human placenta. It does cross the rodent placenta and alters fetalcholesterol metabolism. While teratogenic studies have not demonstrated any effect attributable to clofibrate, it is known that serum of the rabbit fetus accumulates a higher concentration ofclofibrate than that in the mother. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknownwhether clofibrate enters human breast milk.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. A variety of withdrawal symptoms may occurwith abrupt discontinuation of clomipramine. Women of reproductive age are frequently prescribed TCAs, and there has been no apparent decline in prescriptions in recent years. The frequent prescription of potentially toxic agents to pregnantwomen may be due to increases in unplanned pregnancies inindustrial countries, lack of adequate scientific evidence on the adverse effects, and conflicting needs to treat maternal diseases and to protect fetuses.Side effects include dry mouth, sedation, headache, constipation, and seizures. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Clomipramine and its major metabolite cross the human placenta, achieving F/M ratios of 0.6 and 0.8, respectively.Withdrawal symptoms, including jitteriness, tremor, and seizures,are reported in neonates whose mothers had taken clomipramine until delivery. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. Neonatal clomipramine on days 8-21 produced behavioral and physiologic abnormalitiesresembling those found in adult human depression. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Since only trace amounts of clomipramine are found in human breast milk, it is likely compatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ A dose adjustment may be necessary when given withanticholinergic or sympathomimetic drugs.Several TCAs block the pharmacologic effects of guanethidine, clonidine, or similar agents, and such an effect may be anticipated with clomipramine because of its structural similarity to other TCAs.Haloperidol increases the plasma concentration of clomipramine. Patients with low activity of CYP2D6 have higher than expectedplasma concentrations of TCAs. Depending on the fraction ofdrug metabolized by CYP2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8-fold increase in plasma AUC). In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity ofthis isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble ''poormetabolizers.'' An individual who is stable on a given dose may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 includesome that are not metabolized by the enzyme ( cimetidine ) and phenothiazines, and inhibit CYP2D6, an isozyme also involved in TCA metabolism, they vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degreeof inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Furthermore, whenever one of these drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of the TCA may be required.Because clomipramine is highly bound to serum protein, its use in patients taking other drugs highly bound to protein (e.g., warfarin, digoxin ) may cause an increase in plasma 222concentrations of these drugs, potentially resulting in adverse effects. #References .........................

Severalinvestigators have used clonazepam for seizure prophylaxis in severe preeclampsia.Side effects include respiratory depression, neutropenia, hepatic failure, ataxia, confusion, visual changes, drowsiness, andbehavioral changes. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Clonazepam crosses the human placenta, achieving an F:M ratio approximating 0.60. While congenitalanomalies are reported in 13% of infants whose mothers took clonazepam during pregnancy in combination with other antiepileptic drugs, there is no pattern of anomalies. The majority 223of exposed infants are normal at birth and have normal postnatal development. Most series conclude no increase in risk, but all are underpowered to detect an increased prevalence of major malformations. Exposure in the late 3rd trimester and duringlabor seems to carry greater risks to the perinate. While the neonatal withdrawal syndrome is rare, children born to treated women may have symptoms varying from mild sedation,hypotonia, and reluctance to suck to apnea spells, cyanosis, andimpaired metabolic responses to cold stress. These symptoms can persist from hours to months after birth. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing mothers. Clonazepam enters human breast milk. Limited study suggests the breastfeeding neonate could ingest a clinicallyrelevant amount. Breastfed newborns should observed closelyfor an approximately 30% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels. Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of theCYP3A family in clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, notably oral antifungal agents, should be usedwith caution. no substantive evidence that clonazepam alone is a teratogen in humans, though additional study is in order. /C15Exposure in the late 3rd trimester and during labor seems tocarry greater risks to the perinate. /C15Clonazepam should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if the benefit justifies the potential perinatal (Bangladesh, Canada, England, Hong Kong, Ireland, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Puerto Rico, South Africa); Catapresan (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Peru,Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Venezuela); Catapresan 100 (Mexico); bid; max 1.2mg PO Also analgesia or as an adjunctive anesthetic-neuraxial given IV/PO NOTE: caution should be used due potential rebound hypertension. /C15Contraindications \u2014hypersensitivity /C15Caution \u2014CV disease, hepatic and is popular for treatment-seeking opiate abusers, particularly those with concurrent cocaine use. The abuse potential of the drug warrants further study in this high-risk population. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inpregnant women. Women withdrawing from a variety of illicit narcotics or tobacco may benefit from clonidine initially and then methadone if symptoms persist. The combination of epidural clonidine with bupivacaine/fentanyl for pain control during labor improves analgesia, and reduces the supplementation rate andfrequency of shivering. A similar beneficial effect is reported when combined with subarachnoid morphine for post-cesarean section analgesia. Though hypotension and bradycardia are drugdependent, no adverse maternal hemodynamic effects are noted if used in low doses mixed with opioids and local anesthetic. However, troublesome maternal sedation has been reported.Side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, headache, rash, nausea, edema, and dry eyes. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Clonidine readily crosses the placenta, achieving an F:M ratio of 1. Amniotic fluid concentrations are up to 4 /C2 those in serum. Neonates of women receiving clonidine during labor are not sedated, but may experience some hypotension.Clonidine does not negatively affect the FHR pattern. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity orIUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically.However, there is an increase in the rate of embryo absorption. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Clonidine is concentrated in human breast milk, reaching an M:P ratio approximating 2. Caution is advised. #Drug Interactions ................

The absorption t/2 approximates 0.77h and the elimination t/2 is 1.3h in pregnant women. Side effects include hepatic failure, drowsiness, headache, hypotension, and dry mouth. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Clorazepate appears to cross the placenta more slowly than other benzodiazepines (20% compared to 85% fordiazepam). An increased risk of malformations is reported in some studies for some benzodiazepines. The lowest effective dose ofclorazepate should be used during delivery, because high doses are associated with floppy infant syndrome. Rodent teratogenicitystudies apparently have not been performed. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Clorazepate is excreted into human breast milk at low concentrations, though the kinetics remain to be detailed. As withother benzodiazepines in breast milk, caution is advised. #Drug Interactions ................

There are no adequate reports well-controlled studies inpregnant women. Vaginal candidiasis (moniliasis or thrush) is a common and frequently distressing infection for many women.Treatments for 7d may be necessary during pregnancy rather thanthe shorter courses more commonly used for nonpregnant women. Topical clotrimazole appears to be more effective than nystatin for treating symptomatic vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy. One case-control study concluded women treated with vaginal clotrimazole during pregnancy had a lower prevalence of preterm birth that could not otherwise be explained. There are notrial data to support this observation. Candida sepsis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sepsis following CVS. Side effects include erythema, burning, edema, pruritus, and vaginal irritation. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether clotrimazole crosses the human placenta. There is little maternal, systemic absorption after dermal application, and only 3-10% is absorbed after intravaginaladministration ( <0.03mcg/ml). Thus, considering the dose and route, it is unlikely the maternal systemic concentration will reacha clinically relevant level. One case report describes fetal death at18w gestation in association with a retained IUD and asymptomatic intra-amniotic and fetal infection by C. albicans. 228Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

Cloxacillin sodium is a broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus and is usually combined with ampicillin. There are no adequate reports or well- controlled studies in pregnant women. Before its withdrawal in 229the US, cloxacillin was used for the treatment of mastitis. There is a significant increase in the free plasma fraction of cloxacillin during pregnancy, beginning in the 2nd trimester and peaking at delivery. A similarly increased free-of-fraction cloxacillin is found in cord blood, which increases further during the 1st postnatal week. Cloxacillin is highly concentrated in the kidneys. Side effects include seizures, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and renal failure. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Cloxacillin crosses the human placenta. Fetal drug levels rise slowly to equilibrium within the maternal circulation1-3h after drug administration. Thereafter, fetal drug levels exceed maternal values. AF levels are low during early gestation, rising progressively near term until they exceed maternal values 6-8hafter drug administration.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Clozapine is a relatively new medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The published experienceduring pregnancy is limited to case reports. It is effective inresponsive patients experiencing positive (hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior, hostility) and negative (withdrawal, blunted emotions, lack of motivation, and inability to experiencepleasure or enjoyment) symptoms. Negative symptoms seem torespond better to clozapine compared to traditional antipsychotics. Studies in rats revealed a rapid increase in thelevel of serum prolactin with peak values at 15 and 60min.Clinical experience suggests most current psychotropic drugs arerelatively safe for use in pregnancy. Side effects include agranulocytosis, leukopenia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, thrombosis, constipation, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in thehuman fetus. It is unknown whether clozapine crosses the human placenta. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. Clozapine enters human breast milk, achieving an M:P ratio between 2.8 and 4.3 and a milk level of 116ng/ml. It was estimated the nursing infant would ingest<20mcg/kg/d. Animal studies suggest clozapine can affect neonatal behavior. If breastfeeding continues, the infant should bemonitored for possible adverse effects, the drug given at thelowest effective dose, and breastfeeding avoided at times of peak drug levels. #Drug Interactions ................ Should not be used with agents having a well-known potential to suppress bone marrow function. Caution is advised using it with other CNS-active drugs or alcohol.May potentiate the hypotensive effects of antihypertensive drugsand the anticholinergic effects of atropine-type drugs. The administration of epinephrine should be avoided in the treatment of drug-induced hypotension because of a possible reverse epinephrine effect. Clozapine is a substrate for decrease clozapine plasma levels, resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective dose. Cimetidine, caffeine, anderythromycin may increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse effects. Although use with carbamazepine is not recommended, it should be noted discontinuation of carbamazepine causes an increase in plasma levels. Fluvoxamine may increase clozapine and its metabolites by some 3-fold. A reduced clozapine dose should be considered. In 3-10% of patients there is reduced activity of certain drug- metabolizing enzymes (e.g., CYP2D6). Such ''poor metabolizers'' of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, the TCAs, and clozapine may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations when given usual doses. In addition, certain drugsthat are metabolized by this isozyme, including manyantidepressants ( clozapine, SSRIs, and others), may inhibit the activity of this isozyme, and thus may make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. 231Use with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either clozapine or the other drug.

Cocaine is a highly addictive drug and is abused widely. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Maternal cocaine use is a significant public health problem, particularly in urban areas and among women of low socioeconomic status. Cocaine stimulates isolated myometrial contractile activity, and several clinical studies report an associationbetween cocaine and preterm labor. Although cocaine inhibits uterine neuronal and extraneuronal uptake of catecholamines, andincreases circulating levels of catecholamines in experimental animals, it is unlikely that facilitation of the a-adrenergic pathway is the sole mechanism of action. Cocaine -exposed women have a higher risk of medical complications including syphilis, gonorrhea, and hepatitis; psychiatric, nervous, and emotional disorders; PROM and abruptio placentae; and domestic violence. #Fetal Considerations ...........

Cocaine crosses the human placenta and is associated with placental abruption, free radical production, andfetal encephalopathy. Cocaine -exposed children are at increased 232risk of significant cognitive deficits, and a doubling of the rate of developmental delay during the first 2y of life. Cocaine has teratogenic or adverse effects on the developing brain. Cocaine - exposed infants require medical attention for CNS irritation,cardiac anomalies, apnea, and feeding difficulties. It is estimated $500 million (US) in additional health expenditures result from the direct hospital costs of cocaine -exposed neonates. Ongoing maternal drug use is associated with worse developmentaloutcomes among a group of drug-exposed infants. However, the prevalent belief is that the effects of cocaine diminish with age and are mediated largely through psychosocial factors. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursingmothers. Cocaine freely enters human breast milk and is stable. #Drug Interactions ................ Cocaine interferes with the uptake of NE by adrenergic nerve terminals, producing sensitization to catecholamines, 1998;846:51-68.Refuerzo JS, Sokol Med 2003;157:133-8.

Codeine is metabolized to morphine . There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Codeine is contained in many tablets prescribed for the relief of headaches. It is commonly used alone and in combination to relieveepisiotomy pain during the puerperium. Combining codeine with an NSAID significantly enhances pain relief. Codeine is not effective for the relief of uterine cramps. Codeine overdose may be reversed with naloxone. Side effects include dizziness, euphoria, N/V, constipation, dry mouth, urinary retention, and itching. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Morphine readily crosses the placenta. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity, though IUGR is seen at doses below those producing maternaltoxicity. Neonatal abstinence syndrome is reported. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing mothers. Codeine and its metabolite morphine are excreted in human breast milk. Breastfeeding neonates have low plasma levels during the first few days of life in part secondary to the low concentration in milk, and in part due to the smallamount of milk produced. Thus, moderate codeine use (up to 60mg) is probably compatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Codeine has additive depressant effects with other analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines,tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol). The dosage of one or both agents should be reduced. #References ......................... Bloomfield SS, Mitchell J, Cissell G, Barden TP.

Gout is extremely rare in pregnancy. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Colchicine is found in some herbs such as Ginkgo biloba. It has been used successfully to treat familial Mediterranean fever. Amniocentesis is typically recommended for women using colchicine at conception. Colchicine -induced myopathy and neuropathy appear more common than previously recognized. Patientsreceiving long-term therapy should be monitored carefully.Side effects include loss of hair, GI symptoms, and loss of appetite. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Colchicine crosses the human placenta. While the kinetics remain to be elucidated, it is detectable after maternalingestion of herbal remedies where the concentration is highenough to affect neutrophil adherence. It does cross the rodentplacenta, and is teratogenic at doses of 1.25 and 1.5mg/kg in mice and 10mg/kg in hamsters. Because of its mechanism of action, it is suggested women who take colchicine during fertilization have an increased likelihood of an aneuploid fetus. As a result, someauthors do not advise discontinuation of colchicine before pregnancy but recommend amniocentesis for karyotyping.The evidence supporting this recommendation is scant. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Colchicine is excreted into human breast milk in low quantities. It usually considered compatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Colchicine can induce reversible malabsorption of vitamin B 12, apparently by altering the function of ileal mucosa.Animals studies suggest colchicine may increase the response agents. 94:1186-91.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inpregnant women. Colestipol is an adjunctive therapy for the reduction of elevated serum total and LDL-C in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (elevated LDL-C) who do not respond adequately to diet. Chronic use of colestipol may lead to increased bleeding secondary to the hypoprothrombinemia ofvitamin K deficiency. Side effects include nausea, bloating, belching, flatulence, and weight loss. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether colestipol crosses the human placenta. However, it is not absorbed systemically (<0.17% of the dose), and thus should not directly cause fetal harm at the recommended dosages. Rodent studies are reassuring,revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use ofdoses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inbreastfeeding women. Colestipol is not absorbed into the systemic circulation, which suggests a direct effect onbreastfeeding is not possible. However, prolonged use could induce malabsorption and decrease the milk concentration of vitamins A, D, and K. #Drug Interactions ................ In vitro studies indicate that colestipol binds a number of drugs. Therefore, the interval between colestipol and any other medication should be as long as possible. Patients should takeother drugs at least 1h before or 4h after colestipol. The absorption of chlorothiazide as reflected in urinary excretion is markedly decreased even when administered 1h beforecolestipol.The absorption of tetracycline, furosemide, penicillin G, hydrochlorothiazide, andgemfibrozil significantly decreased when given simultaneously with colestipol. Bile acid-binding resins may interfere with the absorption of oralphosphate supplements and hydrocortisone. should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if the benefit justifies the potential perinatal risk. treatment may cause adrenal suppression; use the lowest dose for shortest time.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inpregnant women. Cortisone circulates both bound and unbound, the latter active and representing a small percentage. Hepatic synthesis of the steroid-binding protein increases under the influence of estrogen during early pregnancy. Women withCushing's disease may require additional cortisone to saturate the newly formed binding protein and prevent the free cortisone level from falling during the first 2 or 3mo of pregnancy. It issuggested but poorly documented that chronic steroidadministration increases the incidence of maternal infection. Women who receive a short-term burst of steroids, such as those with PPROM, have no increased incidence of chorioamnionitis.The potent fluorinated steroids, betamethasone anddexamethasone, are more effective at accelerating fetal lung maturity than the less potent corticosteroids, cortisol, cortisone, impaired wound healing. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Primate studies suggest almost complete conversion of cortisol tocortisone by the placenta. Some suggest emotional stress during organogenesis may cause congenitalmalformations by increasing the level of cortisone. Retrospective epidemiologic studies have sought an association between oralclefting and exposure to corticosteroids. After controlling forconfounding factors, it was concluded that prenatal exposure tocorticosteroids increase the risk of cleft lip with or without cleft palate 6-fold. IUGR and shortening of the head and mandible are also suggested sequelae. Yet, the Collaborative Perinatal Projectfollowed women treated during the 1st trimester and, while the number of exposures was limited, no increase in congenital malformations was detected. There was no increase in risk ofanomalies after organogenesis. Women exposed to topical 238cortisone during pregnancy have no significant increase in birth defects. Female rats exposed to cortisone in utero exhibit premature vaginal opening. Cortisone accelerates fetal rat intestinal maturation, perhaps explaining why corticosteroids decrease the incidence of NEC. In sum, the evidence that cortisone is a human teratogen is weak. Cortisone has been reported to reduce short-term variability of the fetal heart rate; a similar phenomenon is recognized with betamethasone. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inbreastfeeding women. Cortisone is present in human milk, but it is unclear whether maternal treatment increases theconcentration. #Drug Interactions ................ Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin ) may increase the clearance of corticosteroids and may require increases in corticosteroid dose to achieve the desired response. Troleandomycin andketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of corticosteroids and thus decrease their clearance. The dose of corticosteroid should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity. Corticosteroids may increase the clearance of chronic high-doseaspirin. This could lead to decreased salicylate levels or increased risk of salicylate toxicity when the corticosteroid is withdrawn. The effect of corticosteroids on oral anticoagulants is variable. There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects ofanticoagulants when given concurrently with corticosteroids.Coagulation indices should be monitored closely. #References .........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Cyclosporine promotes growth of 1st trimester human cytotrophoblasts by apparently increasing their invasive ability. Successful pregnancy after solid organ transplantation is common. Preconception criteria for theoptimal transplant recipient include good transplant graftfunction, no evidence of rejection, a minimum of 1-2y post- transplantation, and either no or well-controlled hypertension. For these women, pregnancy is generally without significantadverse effect. Because preeclampsia develops in 30% of pregnant renal transplant patients, especially those with pretransplantation arterial hypertension, BP, renal function,proteinuria, and weight should be monitored every 2-4wuntil the 3rd trimester, and then every week. Antihypertensive agents should be changed to those tolerated during pregnancy. Cyclosporine alters placental endothelin-1/NO vasoactive balance, yet newborns of transplant recipient mothers are typically AGAand normotensive. Side effects include and hyperuricemia. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Transfer of cyclosporine across the isolated perfused placenta is poor, <5% of the maternal load. This is consistent with a case report. Most offspring have normalpostnatal growth and development after maternalimmunosuppressive therapy. Some studies suggest a higher risk ofstillbirth, preterm delivery, and IUGR in transplant patients treated with cyclosporine. Whether this is due to the disease or cyclosporine is unknown. Preliminary evidence suggests prenatal exposure to immunosuppressive drugs does not have a profound effect on the developing immune system. Children born to transplanted women taking cyclosporine have normal renal function despite prolonged exposure in utero. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing mothers. Cyclosporine is excreted into human breast milk at low quantities, though neonatal clearance may be low. Inone study, breastfed infants of treated mothers ingested less than 247300mcg/d and absorbed undetectable amounts. However, in another study of 5 breastfeeding women, there was a wide range of infant exposures, and 1 infant reached a therapeutic level despite low milk concentrations. In rats, neonatal exposure tocyclosporine in breast milk causes significant alterations in T-cell maturation and inhibition of lymphoproliferative responsivenessto mitogen activation. it reduces number ofnephrons. #Drug Interactions ................ Drugs absorption and should be avoided. Cyclosporine is extensively metabolized by CYP3A. Agents that inhibit CYP3A may decrease metabolism and increase cyclosporine concentrations. grapefruit juice also increase cyclosporine blood level.Agents that reduce cyclosporine levels include carbamazepine, nafcillin, octreotide, orlistat, phenobarbital, phenytoin,rifampin, andticlopidine. There are reports of a serious drug interaction betweencyclosporine and the herbal dietary supplement St. John's wort. This interaction produces a marked reduction in the blood concentrations of cyclosporine, leading to rejection of transplanted organs and graft loss. Clinical status and serum creatinine should be closely monitoredwhen cyclosporine is used with an NSAIDs in rheumatoid arthritis patients.Pharmacodynamic interactions have been reported to occurbetween cyclosporine and both naproxen andsulindac, in that their use is associated with decreased renal function. This interaction leads to a doubling of diclofenac levels and a reversible decrease in renal function. Thus, the dose of diclofenac should be in the lower end of the therapeutic range.Preliminary data reveal that methotrexate AUC increase 30% and of its methotrexate, decreased by 80% when administered to rheumatoid arthritis patients withcyclosporine. May reduce the clearance of prednisolone, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Severe digitalis toxicity has occurred within days of starting cyclosporine in patients taking digoxin. There are also reports of colchicine - induced myopathy and neuropathy, especially in patients withrenal dysfunction.Myotoxicity, including muscle pain and weakness, myositis, co-administration with lovastatin, simvastatin, and fluvastatin. Thus, the dose of these statins should be reduced according to label recommendations.Hyperkalemia may result if used with potassium-sparing diuretics. Vaccination may be less effective if given with cyclosporine. The use of live vaccines should be avoided.Frequent gingival hyperplasia with nifedipine and convulsions with high-dose methylprednisolone are reported. 248Psoriasis patients receiving other immunosuppressive agents or radiation therapy (including PUVA and UVB) should not receive cyclosporine because of the possibility of excessive immunosuppression.

Dalteparin is a LMWH (5000MW) with improved increased plasma elimination t/2, and factor Xa inhibitory activity compared to unfractionated heparin. Dalteparin given once or twice daily (IV or SC) is as effective as unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of acute DVT. LMWHs are increasingly popular during pregnancy for the treatment of various thrombophilias and the antiphospholipid syndrome, though evidence of their efficacy remains limited. LMWHs differ in pharmacologic profiles. The mean retention time of anti-Xaactivity varies and to once- daily dosing for prophylaxis in the nonpregnant patient, they aremore expensive than unfractionated heparin and have the same risks. Heparin and heparin products are not treatments for preeclampsia. However, women with ACE insertion/deletionpolymorphism are at increased risk of recurrent disease in a subsequent pregnancy, and 5000IU dalteparin daily reportedly decreases the risk of recurrence. The therapeutic dose of dalteparin during pregnancy is based on maternal weight. Interpatient variability is wide during pregnancy and clearance significantly enhanced. Peak anti-Xa levels occur at 2554h postbolus in pregnancy, compared with 2h in the nonpregnant state. The mean anti-Xa levels at 12, 24, and 36w gestation are each significantly reduced 2h postinjection, compared with the nonpregnant state. The lowest dose-response curve was at 36wgestation. The initial prophylactic dose for most pregnant women in the 1st trimester is 5000U daily. Anti-Xa activity is measured after initiating therapy, and again periodically (at least eachtrimester) to confirm the adequacy of the prophylactic ortherapeutic dose. A dose of 5000U SC should produce anti-Xa activity of 0.20-0.40U/ml (0.4-0.7U/ml for full anticoagulation) 3h after injection. Women treated with LMWHs for prevention ofthromboembolic complications are at risk of developing anepidural or spinal hematoma after neuraxial anesthesia. It is prudent to wait at least 12h after the removal of an epidural catheter before LMWHs are best at 36w because of their long t/2s, and inability to rapidly measure residual activity (anti-Xa levels). One prospective study of bone density in women receiving LMWH found no significant change in mean bone densitybetween baseline and 6w postpartum. Another suggested any decrease was consistent with the normal decline associated with pregnancy.Side effects include bleeding, thrombocytopenia, fever, pruritus, osteoporosis, easy bruising, epistaxis, injection site reaction, and elevated LFTs. #Fetal Considerations ........... Dalteparin, similar to other LMWHs and unfractionated heparin, does not cross the placenta. It is generally safe and effective forthe noted indications during pregnancy. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity despite the useof doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Only trace amounts of dalteparin (2500U /C21 IU, and measured as anti-Xa activity) enter human breast milk. It is highly unlikelythat puerperal treatment would have any clinically relevant effect on the nursing infant. #Drug Interactions ................ Dalteparin should be used with care in patients receiving oral anticoagulants, platelet inhibitors, and thrombolytic agentsbecause of increased risk of bleeding. #References .........................

There are no indications during pregnancy for danazol. It should be discontinued if the patient becomes pregnant. Danazol is not 257an effective contraceptive. It decreases the maternal progesterone level if taken during the 1st trimester. Side effects include alteration of the lipid profile (low HDL), contraceptive failure, pseudotumor cerebri, weight gain, acne and seborrhea, mild hirsutism, virilization, edema, hair loss, hoarseness, menstrual irregularities, flushing, sweating, vaginal dryness, reduction in breast size, hypertension, anxiety, andthromboembolism. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether danazol crosses the human placenta. Though the FDA classifies danazol as category X, there is no reason a priori to terminate an exposed pregnancy. Danazol can have an androgenic effect on female fetuses (vaginal atresia, clitoral hypertrophy, labial fusion, ambiguous genitalia).Thus, exposed fetuses should undergo a detailed ultrasoundexamination. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. Danazol is associated with inhibition of fetal development in rabbits. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women.

No adverseneonatal effects are reported. Dantrolene is embryocidal in rodents when administered at a multiple of the MRHD. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Dantrolene is excreted in human breast milk, but the peak concentration reported is small and unlikely to produce neonatal levels as high as fetal levels. Though the kinetics remain to be detailed, dantrolene is likely compatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Binding to plasma proteins is reduced by warfarin andclofibrate, and increased by tolbutamide. The combination of IV dantrolene and calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, should not be used together for the management of malignant hyperthermia until further researchis with CNS depressants such as sedatives and tranquilizing agents may result in increased drowsiness. #References .........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of dapsone in pregnant women. Dapsone, alone or in combination with pyrimethamine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or pentamidine, is the most commonly used drug for PCP prophylaxis. Dapsone should be administered in combination with one or more antileprosy drugs to avoid resistance. Dapsone should also be considered during pregnancy in areas whereP. falciparum resistance to chloroquine andpyrimethamine - sulfadoxine is rapidly increasing. Mild degrees of hemolysis occur consistently with continued therapy but may be less likely with intermittent treatment. Most reported adverse effects have occurred after long-term use.Side effects include hemolysis, aplastic anemia, peripheral neuropathy, N/V, abdominal pains, pancreatitis, vertigo, blurred vision, tinnitus, insomnia, fever, headache, fatigue, malaise, eosinophilia, syndrome. Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Transfer across the human placenta likely occurs, as there are reports of neonatal methemoglobinemia after maternal dapsone. Dapsone appears unassociated with fetal abnormalities in humans. Rodent teratogenicity studies have not been performed. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Dapsone is excreted in breast milk in substantial amounts, with the unsupplemented breastfed infant receiving some 15% of thematernal dose. Hemolytic reactions can occur in newborns. Caution is advised. Breastfeeding is contraindicated in HIV-infected nursing women where formula is available to reduce therisk of neonatal transmission. #Drug Interactions ................

Daunorubicin with an anthracycline is an encapsulated form designed to maximize selectivity for solid tumors such as Kaposi's sarcoma. The specific mechanism by which the daunorubicin citrate liposome delivers the drug to solid tumors is not known. It is also commonly used in combination with other drugs for the treatment of breast cancer. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofdaunorubicin in pregnant women. There are multiple reports of its use during pregnancy with a successful outcome. Side effects include bone marrow suppression, hepatic and cardiac toxicity, alopecia, N/V, diarrhea, mucositis, back pain, flushing, chest tightness, fever, and local tissue necrosis at the siteof drug extravasation. #Fetal Considerations ...........

Because delavirdine increases the plasma concentrations of several protease inhibitors, it may also be beneficial as a component of salvage therapy in combination with protease inhibitors.Side effects include skin rash (up to 20%), angioedema, syndrome, headache, anxiety, and edema. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether delavirdine crosses the human placenta. In rodents, delavirdine causes embryotoxicity and VSDs at doses that are multiples of the MRHD. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether delavirdine enters human breast milk. Breastfeeding is contraindicated in HIV-infected nursing women where formula is available to reduce the risk of neonatal transmission. #Drug Interactions ................ Delavirdine has numerous recognized and predicted drug interactions. All prescribers should review the package insertbefore adding a new drug. Delavirdine inhibits the metabolism of many drugs (e.g., antiarrhythmics, calcium channel blockers, sedative-hypnotics,and others), and serious and/or life-threatening drug interactions may result from the inappropriate use of some drugs. Further,some drugs markedly reduce delavirdine plasma concentrations, resulting in suboptimal antiviral activity and the emergence ofdrug resistance. Inhibits CYP3A and to a lesser extent CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19. Administration with drugs primarily metabolized byCYP3A (e.g., HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and sildenafil ) may increase plasma levels of the co-administered drug that increaseor prolong both therapeutic or adverse effects.Use of lovastatin orsimvastatin is not recommended, and caution should be exercised if delavirdine must be used with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors also metabolized byCYP3A4 (e.g., atorvastatin, cerivastatin ). The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, may be increased when delavirdine in this circumstance. 264The use of St. John's wort with NNRTIs, including delavirdine, may substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and lead to the loss of virologic response and the emergence of resistance to delavirdine or to the class of NNRTIs. Use with drugs that induce CYP3A, such as rifampin and rifabutin, may decrease delavirdine plasma concentrations, reduce its therapeutic effect, and increase the chance of resistanceto this class of NNRTIs. Not surprisingly, drugs that inhibitCYP3A may increase delavirdine plasma concentrations. Phenytoin, phenobarbital, andcarbamazepine may lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to delavirdine or to the class of NNRTIs.Cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, andterfenadine are contraindicated due to the potential and/orlife-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias. Dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, and methylergonovine may cause serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as acute ergot toxicity characterized by peripheralvasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues.Use with nifedipine -like calcium channel antagonists is contraindicated as it may trigger serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias.Administration of didanosine (buffered tablets) and delavirdine should be separated by at least 1h. A dose reduction of either saquinavir orindinavir should be considered when given with delavirdine. Delavirdine may increase the published experience in lactation. #Summary ...........................

Depression is a commonly overlooked and undertreated disorder during pregnancy and the puerperium. Pregnancy is not a reasona priori to discontinue psychotropic drugs. Women with a history of depression are at high risk for recurrence during pregnancyand the puerperium. TCAs continue to be widely used duringpregnancy, but remain inadequately studied. Desipramine is a metabolite of imipramine. Desipramine lowers the threshold for seizures. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studiesofdesipramine in pregnant women. There are marked interindividual differences during pregnancy in the metabolism of TCAs. TCAs are effective for the treatment of postpartum depression.Side effects include stroke, MI, arrhythmias, thrombocytopenia, seizures, urinary retention, and glaucoma. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether desipramine crosses the human placenta. No evidence of teratogenicity is seen in rhesus monkey fetuses exposed to imipramine despite a high incidence of maternal toxicity and abortion. A large body of study on the impact of in utero exposure to desipramine on postnatal neurologic function is inconclusive. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Desipramine is excreted in small quantities into human breast milk, but is not detectable in the blood of breastfeeding newborns. No adverse effects are reported in breastfeeding neonates. #Drug Interactions ................ Metabolized by CYP2D6, and the activity of 2D6 is reduced in 7- 10% of Caucasians (''poor metabolizers''). Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of TCAs when givenusual doses. The increase in plasma concentration may be small,or quite large (up to an 8-fold increase in the AUC). The drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 include both those that are not metabolized by the enzyme ( quinidine, cimetidine ) and those that CYP2D6 to varying degrees. The extent to which this interaction creates a clinical problem will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Caution is 268indicated in co-administration and in switching from one class to the other. Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage are required when desipramine is given concomitantly with anticholinergic or sympathomimetic drugs.

As opposed to natural hormone, 269desmopressin (1-deamino-[8- D-arginine]vasopressin) has no uterotonic action in antidiuretic doses. It is the treatment of choice for most patients with type I vWD. Types II and III are usually unresponsive, and best treated with either FFP orconcentrates containing von Willebrand factor. There is a high risk of delayed postpartum hemorrhage in vWD type I, especially during the first week. The risk is independent of the factor VIIIlevel during the 3rd trimester, and reflects the rapid clearance ofthe various factor VIII components postpartum. The risk of postpartum hemorrhage is especially high in women with type II or III vWD, and desmopressin is effective prophylaxis in responsive women. Hemorrhage may occur up to 5w postpartum.Administer desmopressin at least 30min prior to a surgical procedure to maintain hemostasis during the procedure andimmediately postoperatively. It is also effective treatment forwomen who develop transient diabetes insipidus during latepregnancy and/or the immediate puerperium. Maternal desmopressin use reduces and stabilizes plasma osmolality and increases AF volume. It has been proposed as a possible treatment of oligohydramnios and, if given intra-amniotically, polyhydramnios. Side effects include hyponatremia, cerebral edema, rhinitis, flushing, abdominal pain, and thrombotic accidents. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. There is no detectable transfer of desmopressin at therapeutic maternal drug concentrations. No adverse fetal effectsare reported when desmopressin is used during human pregnancy. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence ofteratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than thoseused clinically. In sheep, intra-amniotic desmopressin inhibits fetal urination without CV effect or change in fetal swallowing. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. A single study found minimal desmopressin in human breast milk after a single nasal spray. Considering thedose and dosing frequency, it seems unlikely a significant quantitywould reach the breastfeeding neonate. It has been used to treatdiabetes insipidus during the puerperium. #Drug Interactions ................

Dexamethasone is used widely during pregnancy for the acceleration of fetal lung maturity. A comparison of PO (8mg) versus IM (6mg) dosing reveals similar bioavailability as determined by the AUC and terminal t/2s. Most large studiesconclude the risk of maternal infection in women after PPROM isnot increased by dexamethasone. It may transiently cause an abnormal glucose tolerance test, and will worsen diabetesmellitus. Large doses such as those given to hasten the fetal lungmaturation are associated with pulmonary edema, especially whencombined with a tocolytic agent in the setting of an underlying infection. Dexamethasone does not reduce the maternal perception of fetal movements and short-term variability. It is not contraindicated in women with severe preeclampsia requiringpreterm delivery. Women chronically treated must be monitored closely for hypertension or glucose intolerance, and treated with stress replacement doses postoperatively and postpartum.Dexamethasone is an effective antiemetic after general anesthesia for pregnancy termination. There are as yet uncorroboratedreports that IV dexamethasone helps modify the clinical course of the so-called HELLP syndrome both ante- and postpartum. Itmay also reduce itching in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Side effects include immunosuppression, pancreatitis, fluid retention, CV failure, pseudotumor cerebri, suppression of growthand development in children, myositis, Cushing's disease, decreased carbohydrate tolerance, osteoporosis, hepatic dysfunction, thromboembolism, insomnia, and anxiety. #Fetal Considerations ........... Antenatal corticosteroid administration is the only therapyconclusively demonstrated to reduce the perinatal morbidity anddeath associated with preterm delivery. Newborns of treatedwomen have lower incidences of RDS, NEC, and IVH and shorter hospital stays. Therapy for pulmonary maturity should be limited to no more than 2 courses. The route of administration isapparently important, as neonatal outcome is worse whendexamethasone is given PO compared to IM to hasten lung maturation. Dexamethasone readily crosses the human placenta unmetabolized. Infants of women treated chronically should becarefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Complete fetal heart block has been treated with dexamethasone with positive result. Some studies suggest that, in contrast to betamethasone, dexamethasone does not alter biophysical parameters of the fetus (i.e., fetal breathing) when administered for the enhancement oflung maturation. However, oligohydramnios is reportedly more common. When initiated by 6-7w, dexamethasone can prevent or diminish virilization due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia. POdosing is equal to IM for the suppression of unconjugated estriol levels in the 3rd trimester. It is continued until a definitive diagnosis is established by DNA analysis of chorionic villi at 11-13w. One observational study concluded that children subjectedto multiple antenatal doses of dexamethasone to enhance pulmonary maturity were more likely to develop leukomalaciaand neurodevelopmental abnormalities at 2y old than thosetreated with either betamethasone or single doses of dexamethasone. This remains to be confirmed. Some suggest emotional stress during organogenesis can cause congenitalmalformations by increasing the level of cortisone. Corticosteroids produce oral clefting in some rodents. Some epidemiologic studies conclude, after controlling for confounding 272factors, that prenatal exposure to corticosteroids adds a 6-fold increase in the risk for cleft lip with or without cleft palate, IUGR, and shortening of the head and mandible. In contrast, the Collaborative Perinatal Project followed women treated duringthe 1st trimester. While the number of exposures was limited, no increase in congenital malformations was detected. There was no increased risk of anomalies after organogenesis. Antenataldexamethasone for fetal lung maturation is associated with diminished growth (12g at 24-26w, 63g at 27-29w, 161g at 80g at 33-34w gestation) and decreased myelination in several animal models. The long-term impacts of these effectsremain to be established. Corticosteroids (e.g., cortisone ) accelerate fetal rat intestinal maturation, perhaps explaining why corticosteroids decrease the incidence of NEC. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in breastfeeding women. Dexamethasone is excreted into human breast milk, but it is unclear whether maternal treatmentincreases the concentration of cortisone in breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Aminoglutethimide may diminish the adrenal suppression produced by corticosteroids.There are case reports of cardiac enlargement, CHF, andhypokalemia when corticosteroids are administered with potassium-depleting agents such as amphotericin B and diuretics. Macrolide antibiotics can decrease corticosteroid clearance. Anticholinesterase agents and corticosteroids may produce severeweakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. When possible, anticholinesterase agents should be withdrawn at least 24h before initiating corticosteroid therapy.May reduce the response to warfarin. May decrease serum concentrations of isoniazid. Cholestyramine may increase corticosteroid clearance. The activity of both cyclosporine and corticosteroids may be increased when used together. Convulsions have been reported with this concurrent use. False-negative results have been reported in patients undergoing adexamethasone suppression test when also treated with indomethacin. Ephedrine may increase clearance, decreasing blood levels and activity. CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin ) may plasma concentrations of corticosteroids. A moderate inducer of CYP3A4; use with other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., indinavir, erythromycin ) may increase their clearance, resulting in decreased plasmaconcentration. Ketoconazole may decrease the metabolism of corticosteroids by up to 60%, leading to an increased risk of corticosteroid side effects. Further, it alone can inhibit adrenal corticosteroidsynthesis and cause adrenal insufficiency during corticosteroid withdrawal. Use of aspirin and othe NSAIDs increases the risk of GI side effects. The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids.Corticosteroids may suppress reactions to skin tests.Toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported when dexamethasone is used with thalidomide. 273Patients on corticosteroid therapy may have diminished responses to toxoids and live or inactivated vaccines; routine administration should be deferred until after corticosteroid therapy is discontinued. #References .........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of diatrizoate in pregnant women. Diatrizoate is a contrast agent frequently used to study bladder structure or function andfallopian tube patency, and in the past for a variety of fetal imaging studies. Side effects include hematuria, retrograde infection, renal failure, hypersensitivity, and anaphylactic reaction. #Fetal Considerations ...........

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of diazepam in pregnant women. It is a beneficial adjunct to IV fluids and vitamins for the treatment of 1st trimester hyperemesis. Diazepam was previously used for prophylaxis and treatment of eclamptic convulsions, but proved less effective than magnesium sulfate. Pregnancy may unmask a preexisting potential for chorea (chorea gravidarum), and benzodiazepines may aid chorea control. Diazepam is a useful antianxietal in women undergoing fetal therapy procedures. Flumazenil (a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) is indicated for complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects, or treatment of abenzodiazepine overdose. Side effects include severe burning and vascular irritation, withdrawal syndrome, hepatic toxicity, pancytopenia,neutropenia, hypotension, N/V, vertigo, blurred vision, and rash. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Diazepam rapidly crosses the human placenta, with the F:M ratio approaching unity within 15min of maternalinjection and exceeding the maternal level within several hours ofadministration during labor. Decreased fetal movement frequentlyaccompanies IV administration. Several studies that suggested an increased risk of fetal malformation when diazepam is used during the 1st trimester have not been confirmed subsequently. Postnatal follow-up until age 4y is likewise reassuring, revealing no adverse effects on neurodevelopment. Prolonged CNS depression may occur in neonates, apparently due to theirinability to metabolize diazepam. The shortest course and the lowest dose should be used when indicated during pregnancy. Some newborns exposed antenatally exhibit either the floppy infant syndrome or marked neonatal withdrawal symptoms.Symptoms vary from mild sedation, hypotonia, and reluctance tosuck to apneic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Such symptoms may persist for hours to months after birth. Rodent studies suggest an increased incidence of fetalmalformations (skeletal defects) when administered at much higher doses than ones used clinically. Further, a large body of rodent behavioral studies reveals behavioral alterations that persistinto adulthood. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Diazepam is excreted into human breast milk to a limited degree. The maximum neonatal exposure is estimated at 3% of thematernal dose. Problems may arise if the neonate is premature, orthe maternal dose particularly high. Neonatal lethargy, sedation, and weight loss have been reported, but their attribution to diazepam is not always clear. #Drug Interactions ................ Phenothiazines, narcotics, barbiturates, MAOIs, and other antidepressants may potentiate the action of diazepam. Cimetidine may delay diazepam clearance. Valproate may potentiate the CNS-depressant effects. In vitro studies of human liver suggest CYP2CI9 and CYP3A4 are the principal isozymes involved in the initial oxidative metabolism of diazepam. Potential inhibitors of CYP2CI9 phenobarbital ) may increase the rate of elimination. Diazepam could interfere with the metabolism of CYP2CI9 (e.g., Ditto A, G, la Gynecol Reprod 1996; 11:889-92.Kjaer D, Horvath-Puho E, Christensen J, 1993; J Pediatr Surg 1999;34:1652-7. Wang C, Cheng Y, Liang J. Hunan Ke Da Xue should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if the benefit justifies the potential perinatal risk. /C15Many indications for diazepam have other alternative agents considered to have a higher safety margin during pregnancyand lactation. #Maternal Considerations ..... The mechanism of action of diazoxide remains unclear. It inhibits the production of IL-10 and the proinflammatory cytokines TNF- aand IL-6 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The choice of antihypertensive depends in part on physician experience, and in part on what is known about adverse maternal and fetal side effects. Diazoxide has been used for the treatment of severe hypertension during pregnancy, but isassociated with a high risk of hypotension and its attendant fetal distress. Smaller (15mg IU) but more frequent dosing reduces that risk. There are many alternatives, including labetalol, ketanserin, hydralazine, nitroprusside, nicardipine (in low doses), and nifedipine, of seemingly equal efficacy with much lower complication rates.Side effects include arrhythmias, seizures, MI, hyperglycemia, hypotension, N/V, weakness, and CHF. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Diazoxide crosses the human placenta, though the kinetics remain to be elucidated. Rodent studies are generally reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity, though IUGR is seen at the highest doses. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether diazoxide enters human breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Diazoxide is highly bound to serum proteins and can be expected to displace other bound substances such as bilirubin or warfarin and its derivatives, and thus cause higher blood levels.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Diclofenac is a short-acting NSAID with antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties. It isuseful for the relief of ureteral colic or postsurgical pain duringpregnancy, or episiotomy after delivery. In several studies, diclofenac had a morphine-sparing effect. While rodent studies reveal very high doses of some NSAIDs are associated with dystocia and prolongation of pregnancy, similar studies inhumans are missing for diclofenac. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as diclofenac may modulate the quantity and degradation of collagen in the rat cervix. Diclofenac does not interfere with cervical ripening induced by misoprostol. Like other NSAIDs, diclofenac alters renal function to decrease free water clearance and increases the toxicity of certain drugs such as digoxin. Administration at the time of egg collection in womenundergoing IVF does not appear to affect implantation or pregnancy rates, while it could be effective in reducing discomfort and pain associated with oocyte retrieval. NOTE: with caution, may be combined with misoprostol (Arthrotec). Side include anaphylaxis, bleeding, bronchospasm, thrombocytopenia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, interstitial nephritis, impairment of the liver kidney function, abdominal pain, urticaria, drowsiness, and tinnitus. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Diclofenac rapidly crosses the human placenta even in the 1st trimester, yielding an F:M ratio approximating unity.Premature closure of the ductus arteriosus is reported. Rodentstudies are generally reassuring, revealing no evidenceof teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. High doses were associated with fetal toxicity. In one recent report, the administration of diclofenac to the ovine fetus blunted the normal increase in cerebral blood flow following a hypoxic episode. While it is unknown whether this same response occurs in association with other NSAIDs or in thehuman, it suggests the need for caution administering NSAIDs topregnant women when labor is imminent. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofdiclofenac in nursing women. Most NSAIDs enter human milk to some extent. The chemical structure and preliminary study suggest passage should be low and occasional use is without clinically significant risk. Ibuprofen is generally preferred for breastfeeding women. #Drug Interactions ................ Aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.NSAIDs reportedly inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. Caution should be used when administeringNSAIDs with methotrexate. Like other NSAIDs, diclofenac may affect renal prostaglandins and increase the toxicity of drugs such as cyclosporine. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACEIs. 289Diclofenac reduces the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides; observe closely for signs of renal failure as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. NSAIDs increase plasma lithium levels and reduce renal lithium clearance. Patients should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone. #References .........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether dicyclomine crosses the human placenta. Epidemiologic studies are reassuring. Dicyclomine was a component of Bendectin, a popular but no longer marketed drug used to treat N/V during pregnancy. It initially consisted of doxylamine, dicyclomine, andpyridoxine; dicyclomine was dropped from the formulation in 1976. Bendectin was ultimately discontinued in 1983 after an onslaughtof lawsuits suggesting it caused congenital malformations.Subsequent studies revealed no difference in the prevalence ofbirth defects between mothers who had taken Bendectin during the 1st trimester and those who had not. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGRdespite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women.Dicyclomine is excreted in human milk. As there are case reports noting severe respiratory symptoms in neonates directly receiving dicyclomine, it is generally considered incompatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................

HIV patients with <400 viral copies/ml respond faster (2 consecutive viral loads <400 copies/ml) and maintain that response for 4y when are known. Didanosine is a cause of diabetes mellitus. Blood glucose levels should be monitored frequently, especially when didanosine is combined with other drugs such as pentamidine anddapsone that cause hyperglycemia. Didanosine does not cure HIV, nor 293does it reduce the risk of HIV transmission by sexual contact or blood contamination. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant women who have received a combination of didanosine andstavudine. The long-term effects of didanosine on both treated women and neonates are presently unknown.Side pain, arthralgia, and anorexia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Didanosine rapidly crosses the isolated human placenta, and efficiently crosses in vivo the macaque placenta. It is estimated the fetal levels would be therapeutic. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically.Didanosine does cross the rodent placenta. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknownwhether didanosine enters human breast milk. It is generally recommended that, wherever possible, HIV-infected women not breastfeed to avoid the risk of HIV transmission to the neonate. #Drug Interactions ................ Didanosine has numerous recognized and predicted drug interactions. All prescribers should review the package insertbefore prescribing didanosine or adding new drug. Allopurinol, ganciclovir, andtenofovir increase the didanosine concentration; consult the package insert before prescribing. Administer didanosine at least 2h after or 6h before ciprofloxacin to avoid a decrease in the ciprofloxacin levels. Administer didanosine 1h after delavirdine to avoid a decrease in thedidanosine concentration. Administer didanosine 1h after indinavir to avoid a decrease in indinavir concentration. Methadone decreases the didanosine concentration. Use with drugs known to cause pancreatitis or neuropathy may increase the risk of these toxicities. Ribavirin has been shown in vitro to increase intracellular triphosphate levels of didanosine and its use is not recommended. Fatal hepatic failure, as well as peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, and symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis, have been reported in patients receiving both.Administer drugs such as ketoconazole oritraconazole at least 2h before didanosine to avoid in ketoconazole or itraconazole concentration.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. It is unknown whether diethylpropion crosses the human placenta. Neonatal withdrawal has been described in neonatesdelivered of women who used diethylpropion during pregnancy. There is a single case report of sacral agenesis associated withmultiple anomalies of the lower limb in a woman takingdiethylpropion during the first month of pregnancy. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity orIUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

Diethylpropion is excreted into human breast milk, though the kinetics remain to be elucidated. #Drug Interactions ................ Antidiabetic drug requirements (e.g., insulin) may be altered.Concurrent use with general anesthetics may result in arrhythmias.The pressor effects of diethylpropion and those of other drugs may be additive. Conversely, diethylpropion may interfere with antihypertensive drugs (e.g., guanethidine, methyldopa ). Concurrent use thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic glucose intolerance #Maternal Considerations ..... Diethylstilbestrol was administered to approximately 3 million pregnant women in the US and in the Netherlands between 1947 and 1975. There was an increased risk of mammary carcinomas in exposed women. Pregnancy does not appear to influenceadversely the tumor characteristics or prognosis of patients whohave developed these malignancies. Side effects include depression, nervousness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, N/V, leg edema, erythema nodosum, decreased libido, fatigue, and increased coagulation factors II, VII, VIII, IX, and X. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of diethylstilbestrol in human fetuses. It or a metabolite presumably crosses the human placenta. Diethylstilbestrol -exposed daughters frequently have developmental disorders of the cervix and corpusuteri (hypoplasia of the uterine cavity, uterine corpus, and cervix;T-shaped uterine cavity; constrictions of the uterine cavity; and bilateral hydrosalpinges). They have an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, possiblycervical incompetence and both cervical and vaginal carcinomas at a young age. Spontaneous uterine rupture at term has also been described. An increased risk of hypospadias in the sonsexposed to DES in utero was reported. Rodent experiments reveal thatdiethylstilbestrol increases the incidence of genital tumors in not only 2nd-generation but also 3rd-generation animals.However, recent studies report no increased risk of lower genitaltract abnormalities in 3rd-generation women. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

Diflunisal is an NSAID with anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic properties. Similar to many NSAIDs, it inhibits platelet aggregation. There are no adequate reports of diflunisal in pregnant women. Diflunisal is superior to aspirin for the relief of postepisiotomy pain. Side effects include peptic ulceration, GI bleeding, renal failure. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether diflunisal crosses the human placenta. Treated Cynomolgus monkeys experience no increased rates of abortion, IUGR, or malformation. Rodent studies reveal embryotoxicity and teratogenicity (skeletal malformations) in 1-8/C2 the MRHD. In the human fetus, 298other NSAIDs can cause in the 3rd trimester constriction of the ductus arteriosus, followed by tricuspid incompetence and pulmonary hypertension. Platelet dysfunction, intracranial bleeding, or renal dysfunction may result in permanent renalfailure, oligohydramnios, or necrotizing enterocolitis. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. Diflunisal is excreted into human milk, achieving an M:P ratio <0.07. Considering the indications and dosing, occasional diflunisal use is unlikely to pose a clinically significant risk to the breastfeedingneonate. #Drug Interactions ................ Competitively displaces warfarin from protein binding sites. In some normal volunteers, the concomitant administration ofdiflunisal andwarfarin, acenocoumarol, orphenprocoumon resulted in prolongation of PT. Adjustment of dosage of oralanticoagulants may be required. Concomitant use with hydrochlorothiazide increases the plasma hydrochlorothiazide levels. Decreases the hyperuricemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide. Increases acetaminophen plasma levels by some 50%. NSAIDs decrease the tubular secretion of methotrexate and potentiate its toxicity. NSAIDs increase the risk of cyclosporine -induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin. #References .........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of digitoxin in pregnant women. Digitoxin is a crystalline-pure cardiac glycoside obtained from Digitalis purpurea and has pharmacologic action identical to that of digitalis. Excretion is slow (14-21d). Serum levels should be monitored periodically during pregnancy. Pregnant women receiving the usual dose of0.25mg tend to have subnormal levels and may require a smallincrease during the 3rd trimester. Side effects include digitalis intoxication that includes N/V, visual disturbance, electrolyte abnormalities (hypo/hyperkalemia), and bradycardia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. Digoxin and presumably digitoxin cross the healthy human placenta, reaching F:M ratios approximating 0.8. However, the human placenta is rich in digoxin receptors, and placental binding increased and transfer decreased when there is hydrops.Fetal bradycardia is reported. Studies are compromised by teststhat failed to differentiate between digoxin and endogenous digoxin-like teratogenicity studies have notbeen performed. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

There is a long clinical experience with digoxin during pregnancy and the puerperium for the treatment of benign arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy. A full CV evaluation is recommended prior to its initiation. Potential stimulants, such as smoking, caffeine, and alcohol should be eliminated. Although no antiarrhythmic drug is completely safe during pregnancy, most are well tolerated andadd relatively little risk. Drug therapy should be avoided during the 1st trimester and drugs with the best safety record used as first-line therapy. Women with peripartal cardiomyopathy whohave persistently abnormal must becontinuously treated with digoxin, diuretics, and anticoagulation, and have the same relatively poor prognosis as patients withdilated cardiomyopathy. Heart transplantation may be necessaryfor survival. Side effects include hallucinations, blurred vision, thrombocytopenia, delirium, and electrolyte abnormalities (hypo/hyperkalemia). There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Digoxin crosses the placenta, with a typical F:M ratio ranging from 0.6 to 0.8. There are, however, a highconcentration of placental digoxin receptors and significant back- transport by placental P-glycoprotein. Digoxin is generally considered first-line therapy for the treatment of fetalSVT in the absence of hydrops. Treatment is aimed initially at slowing the ventricular response rate and ultimately conversion to sinus rhythm. However, there are no trials confirming thatconversion reflects therapeutic efficacy or disease natural history.After adequate maternal digitalization, conversion to normal sinus rhythm should occur within 72h; reported successes often occur after weeks. Certainly, the addition of a second agent would bedesirable if there is no response. The fetal response is worse iftricuspid regurgitation is already present. Placental transport is dramatically reduced when there is hydrops, and this appears inversely proportional to the umbilical venous pressure. In thisinstance, many fetal medicine specialists consider flecainide a drug of choice. Direct fetal digoxin administration (IM) can be successful after more traditional intensive trials of transplacentaltherapy with digoxin, verapamil, andprocainamide, either separately or in combination, fail. Transplacental digoxin therapy has also been used to improve ionotropy in fetuses with completeheart block. Despite adequate therapy and many timesimprovement in the fetal status in utero, many fetuses require postnatal pacemaker implantation or heart transplantation. Rodent teratogenicity studies have not been performed. 301#Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. Digoxin enters human breast milk in low concentration, achieving an M:P ratio approximating 0.7. As aresult, the digoxin breastfed neonate would be subtherapeutic. Endogenous digoxin-like substances are a component of breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Potassium-depleting diuretics are a major contributing factor to digitalis toxicity. Calcium, particularly if administered IV, may produce by reducing clearance and/or its volume of distribution.Erythromycin andclarithromycin (and possibly other macrolides) and tetracycline may increase digoxin absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine.Propantheline anddiphenoxylate may increase digoxin absorption by sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal digoxin absorption, resulting in low serum concentrations.Rifampin may decrease serum digoxin concentration, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, by increasing the nonrenal clearance of digoxin. Thyroid administration to a digitalized, hypothyroid patient may increase the dose of digoxin required. Concomitant use of digoxin and sympathomimetics increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.Succinylcholine may cause a sudden extrusion of potassium from muscle cells, and and trigger arrhythmias in digitalized patients. Although b-adrenergic blockers or calcium channel blockers and digoxin may be useful in combination to control atrial fibrillation, their additive effects on AV node conduction cancause advanced or complete heart block.Use caution combining digoxin with drugs that can cause significant renal function deterioration. Due to considerable variability of the above interactions, the dosage of digoxin should be individualized. #References JG, Kilby Fetal Cameron 297:623.

It possesses oxytocic properties and was used in several older trials to assist with the induction of labor. It was also used occasionally duringpregnancy for the treatment of ''low'' BP. Neither of the last 303two are indications. Dihydroergotamine is effective for the treatment of menstrual migraine. Side effects include hypertension, peripheral or bowel ischemia, coronary spasm, MI, chest pain, tachycardia, bradycardia, N/V, numbness in fingers and toes, leg weakness, and itching. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether dihydroergotamine crosses the human placenta. In one series, women with ''low'' BP were treated for 1w and the fetal umbilical artery S/D ratio increased 22%, thus suggesting placental transfer. In guinea pigs,chronic administration of dihydroergotamine is associated with IUGR suggesting decreased placental blood flow. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether dihydroergotamine enters human breast milk. It is known that ergots inhibit prolactin, and that ergotamine is excreted into human breast milk and can have adverse effects onthe breastfed neonate. It would be reasonable to stopbreastfeeding until the headache has resolved. #Drug Interactions ................ Should not be used with peripheral vasoconstrictors as thecombination may cause a synergistic elevation of BP.Should not be taken within 24h of sumatriptan .Sumatriptan has been reported to cause coronary artery vasospasm, and its effectcould be additive with dihydroergotamine.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of diltiazem in pregnant women. Clearance is unaltered during rabbit pregnancy. Diltiazem is used for the treatment of acute cardiac rhythm emergencies. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated effective inhibition of myometrial contractions andvasodilation of arteries collected from normal and preeclamptic women. Oral diltiazem has no advantage over nifedipine as a tocolytic agent. The CV alterations following either drug appear minimal in normotensive, pregnant women. Volume loading anda supine position further reduces the risk of an adverse CV reaction. Case reports document successful treatment of maternal angina secondary to coronary spasm. Recently, a relationship 306between oral erythromycin and sudden cardiac death was reported in patients also receiving strong inhibitors of CYP3A such as nitroimidazole antifungal agents, diltiazem, verapamil, andtroleandomycin; at for CYP3A substrate.Side effects include edema, headache, N/V, dizziness, asthenia, rash, flushing, first-degree AV block, pulmonary congestion, photosensitivity, urticaria, dry mouth, pain, epidermal necrolysis). ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether diltiazem crosses the human placenta. It does rapidly cross the rabbit placenta. Rodent studies suggest an increased incidence of skeletal and aortic archmalformations in some species at doses of diltiazem administered in multiples of the MRHD. Another study of rabbits concludedthat chronic in utero exposure altered postnatal metabolism. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Diltiazem enters human milk and may reach maternal serum levels. Though generally considered safe forbreastfeeding women, it may be wise to consider another calcium channel blocker. #Drug Interactions ................ Diltiazem is both a substrate and an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Other drugs that are specific substrates, inhibitors, or inducers may alterthe efficacy and side effect profile of diltiazem. Patients taking other drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates, especially those with renal and/or hepatic impairment, may require dose adjustments when starting or stopping diltiazem. Patients taking diltiazem with agents known to affect cardiac contractility and/or conduction must be watched closely. The depression of cardiac contractility, conductivity, and automaticity as well as the vascular dilation by anesthetics may be potentiated by calcium channel blockers.Increases the AUC of midazolam andtriazolam 3-4 fold and C maxby 2-fold. The t/2 is also increased (1.5-2.5 fold). Increases propranolol levels and bioavailability by some 50%. If combination therapy is initiated or withdrawn, an adjustment tothepropranolol dose may be necessary. Increases the mean buspirone AUC 5.5-fold and C max4.1-fold. Enhanced effects and increased toxicity of buspirone are possible. Increases serum carbamazepine levels (40-72% increase), resulting in toxicity in some cases. Cimetidine increases peak diltiazem plasma levels (58%) and the AUC (53%). Patients using diltiazem should be carefully monitored when initiating and discontinuing cimetidine. An interaction between diltiazem andcyclosporine is reported in renal and cardiac transplant patients where a reduction in the cyclosporine dose ranging from 15-48% was necessary to maintain trough levels achieved before the addition of diltiazem. May increase plasma digoxin concentrations approximately 20%. Since the data are conflicting, it is recommended digoxin be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuingdiltiazem. May increase the mean lovastatin AUC and C maxby 3-4 times. Increases by t/2 by 36%. Rifampin dramatically lowers the diltiazem plasma concentrations.

Dinoprostone is the naturally occurring PGE 2. It is effective when administered by oral, vaginal, or intracervical routes for cervicalripening preceding either vaginal delivery or pregnancytermination. Efficacy is maintained after membrane rupture.Complications include tachysystole and uterine rupture. Outpatient use has been advocated, but there is no dose that assures the absence of tachysystole. The risk of the latter isespecially great in women with a prior cesarean section. Tworecent randomized trials compared dinoprostone tomisoprostol for the induction of labor in women including those at high riskfor fetal distress. Misoprostol anddinoprostone are equally safe for the induction of labor. However, misoprostol is more efficient, may be associated with a lower cesarean delivery rate,and is significantly cheaper. Dinoprostone reduces the risk of postpartum hemorrhage in high-risk patients. It has also beenused to treat atony. Hypertension and anaphylaxis have been reported on occasion. The safety profile of dinoprostone is good; it has been used successfully in women with a wide range of medical complications.Side effects include bronchospasm, bradycardia, hypertension, arrhythmias, uterine rupture, fetal acidosis, PROM, N/V,diarrhea, headache, uterine contractions, dizziness, flushing, fever,cough, chills, and dyspnea. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether dinoprostone crosses the human placenta. Any effect on the fetus appears to reflect complications of uterine activity, as cervical priming has no effect 310on fetal blood flows. Rodent studies reveal embryotoxicity and an increased prevalence of skeletal anomalies when given during organogenesis. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether dinoprostone enters human breast milk. However, considering the indication and dosing, dinoprostone use is unlikely to pose a clinically significant risk to the breastfeeding neonate. PGE 2is naturally excreted into breast milk and has been reported as a cause of neonatal diarrhea. #Drug Interactions ................

Thromboembolus is a major complication of mechanical heart valves. The risk is greatly reduced but not eliminated by regimens of anticoagulation with warfarin or therapeutic heparin in addition to an antiplatelet agent. Warfarin is relatively contraindicated during pregnancy. The regimen of dipyridamole, 313aspirin, andticlopidine also appears to be effective prophylaxis. The effect on platelet function persists for about 72h after discontinuing therapy, but is not associated with a change in the bleeding time. Because preeclampsia is associated with asubclinical DIC state, and IUGR with placental thrombosis, a number of studies have examined the role of dipyridamole to reduce their incidence. For the most part, dipyridamole adds little to the beneficial effects of 81mg of aspirin for these indications. Dipyridamole has also been used for the treatment of essential thrombocythemia during pregnancy. Side effects include hypotension, MI, arrhythmias, bronchospasm, rash, dyspnea, N/V, tachycardia, flushing, and diarrhea. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether dipyridamole crosses the human placenta. The addition of dipyridamole toaspirin does not enhance the beneficial effect of aspirin on preventing IUGR. Dipyridamole use is associated with decreased Doppler measured flow resistance in the umbilical artery. Rodent studies arereassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no adequate published experience in nursing women. Dipyridamole enters human milk, though the kinetics remain to be elucidated. There is no evidence to suggest a neonatal effect thatwould preclude breastfeeding. It has been used to treat respiratorydifficulties in newborns with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. #Drug Interactions ................ Oral maintenance theophylline and other xanthine derivatives such as caffeine may abolish the coronary vasodilation induced by IV dipyridamole. This could lead to a false-negative thallium imaging result.May increase the plasma levels and CV effects of adenosine, requiring a dose adjustment.May counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. #References .........................

There is no published experience with dirithromycin during pregnancy. Dirithromycin is converted in the intestine to the microbiologically active erythromycylamine. Dirithromycin is comparable in efficacy to erythromycin for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections with significantly less nausea. Once-daily dosing aids compliance. Side effects include arrhythmias, pseudomembranous colitis, anorexia, anxiety, constipation, depression, vasodilation, and malaise. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether dirithromycin crosses the human placenta. Other macrolides cross the placenta. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicitydespite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. Very high doses were associated with IUGR. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether dirithromycin enters human breast milk. It is excreted into rodent milk. Other macrolides are consideredcompatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Absorption is slightly enhanced when taken immediately afterantacids or H 2-receptor antagonists. The following drug interactions have been reported witherythromycins. It is not known whether these same drug interactions will occur with dirithromycin: May decrease triazolam clearance and potentially increase the pharmacologic effect of triazolam. Increases serum digoxin levels. Drug interactions have been reported between erythromycin and other medications, during lactation. 315#Summary ...........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of disopyramide in pregnant women. Pregnancy alters the percentage of free drug circulating in the plasma. Treatment of a cardiac arrhythmia with disopyramide during pregnancy is complicated by reported risks of hemorrhage or hypotension or uterine contractions leading to fetal distress. Patients should bemonitored intensively to detect such complications. Disopyramide is actually superior to placebo for the induction of labor. Side effects include CHF, arrhythmia, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, dizziness, blurred vision, N/V, membranes, anxiety, urinary retention, pruritus, rash, and constipation. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofdisopyramide in human fetuses. It crosses the human placenta, achieving an F:M ratio approximating 0.26 for disopyramide, and 0.43 for its main metabolite, N-monodesalkyl disopyramide. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence ofteratogenicity despite doses higher than those used clinically.The highest doses were associated with embryotoxicity and IUGR. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Though disopyramide is concentrated in human breast milk over maternal plasma after oral administration, theunsupplemented newborn would ingest <2mg/kg. Not 316surprisingly, disopyramide is at or below the level of detection in the neonate. #Drug Interactions ................ Phenytoin and other hepatic enzyme inducers may lower the plasma levels of disopyramide. Monitoring of plasma levels is recommended to avoid ineffective therapy. Other antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, lidocaine, propranolol ) may lead to excessive widening of the QRS complex and/or prolongation of the QT interval. Quinidine may increase slightly disopyramide levels. Absent further research, disopyramide should not be administered 48h before or 24h after verapamil. Cases of life-threatening interactions are reported when given with clarithromycin orerythromycin, indicating that inhibitors of CYP3A4 can cause a potentially fatal interaction. #References .........................

The published literature consists mostly of case reports and small series. Side effects include CV collapse, arrhythmia, seizure, coma, psychosis, optic neuritis, hepatitis, rash, drowsiness, fatigability, headache, allergic dermatitis, and a metallic or garlic-like taste. #Fetal Considerations ...........

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of divalproex in pregnant women. Divalproex is a stabilized form ofvalproic acid. It disassociates into valproate in the GI tract. While the metabolism of valproate is unaltered by pregnancy, clearance is increased primarily because of decreased binding. Itis suggested the drug be taken in divided doses to avoid high peaks (see valproic acid ). Among patients treated for a bipolar disorder, the risk of suicide attempt is higher during treatment with divalproex than it is with lithium. However, divalproex for the prevention of postpartum episodes of bipolar disorder does not appear more effective than monitoring without drug. Valproate seems to reduce the induction of lamotrigine metabolism associated with pregnancy or use of contraceptives.Monitoring of anticonvulsant drug levels with appropriate dose adjustments is warranted throughout pregnancy, and vitamin K (10mg/d) should be given in the last month of gestation,particularly when CYP enzyme-inducing agents are being used. Side effects tremor, appetite insomnia, peripheral edema, blurred vision, tinnitus, and respiratorydisorders. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Valproate and its metabolites cross the placenta, perhaps by a proton-linked transport system, and are concentrated in fetal plasma at least in part because of increased protein binding. The F:M ratio exceeds unity. Valproate is a human teratogen. Valproic acid has been associated with a variety of major and minor malformations, including a 20-fold increase in NTDs, cleft lip and palate, CV abnormalities, GU defects, developmental delay, endocrinologic disorders, limbdefects, and autism. Divalproex monotherapy during the 1st trimester increases the risk of a fetal NTD by about 10 /C2,o rt oa prevalence of 1-2%. This association likely reflectspharmacogenetics since preconception maternal folatesupplementation does not necessarily reduce the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies. Other associated malformations involve the CV system and the limbs. Itscombination with other anticonvulsants increases the risks ofmalformation. In one small but population-based study, all children exposed to valproate had minor, and some of them major, cognitive or neurologic problems. The placenta is not a depot for valproic acid. It would appear that there are more adverse outcomes in pregnancies with in utero valproate exposure vs. the other antiepileptic drugs. Other agents should beused whenever possible. For women who fail other antiepilepticdrug therapy and require valproate, the dose should be limited if possible. As for most psychotropic drugs, monotherapy and the lowest effective quantity given in divided doses to minimize the peaks can minimize the risks. (See Valproic acid.) #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Only small amounts of valproate (1-10%) enter human breast milk, and its serum concentration in breastfedneonates is subclinical. (See Valproic acid. ) 319#Drug Interactions ................ New interactions are continuously being reported. The following is only a partial list. Drugs that affect the expression of hepatic enzymes, particularly those that elevate glucuronosyltransferases, may alter the clearanceofvalproate. For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, andprimidone may double the clearance of valproate. Patients on monotherapy will generally have longer t/2s and higher concentrations than those receiving polytherapyfor antiepilepsy. Monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug concentrations should be increased whenever enzyme-inducingdrugs are started or withdrawn.Aspirin decreases valproate protein binding and inhibits the metabolism of valproate. Felbamate may increase valproate peak concentration by as much as 35%.Rifampin may increase the oral clearance of valproate by up to 40%. May decrease plasma clearance of amitriptyline and its metabolite, nortriptyline. Consider reducing the dose of amitriptyline /nortriptyline in the presence of valproate. Serum carbamazepine decreased while that of its metabolite, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, increased by 45% when given with valproate.Clonazepam may induce absence status in valproate -treated patients with a history of absence-type seizures.Displaces diazepam from its albumin binding sites and inhibits its metabolism, almost doubling the free fraction of diazepam. Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free diazepam are reduced by at least 20%.Inhibits the metabolism of ethosuximide, increasing its elimination t/2 by some 25%. Patients receiving valproate and ethosuximide, especially along with other anticonvulsants, should be monitored closely for changes in serum concentrations of bothdrugs.The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when given with valproate, asvalproate increases the elimination t/2 of lamotrigine from 26h to 70h. Serious skin reactions (such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) havebeen reported andvalproate administration.May reduce the induction of lamotrigine metabolism associated with pregnancy or use of contraceptives. Inhibits the metabolism of phenobarbital, increasing the t/2 by 50% and decreasing clearance by 30%. All patients receiving concomitant barbiturate therapy should be closely monitored forneurologic toxicity. Primidone, which is metabolized to a barbiturate, may be involved in a similar interaction withvalproate.There are reports of breakthrough seizures occurring with thecombination of valproate andphenytoin. Valproate decreases phenytoin albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic metabolism, increasing the free concentration of phenytoin by 60%. Total plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution (Vd) of phenytoin increases 30% in the presence of valproate. Both the clearance and apparent Vd of free phenytoin are reduced by 25%.The clearance of zidovudine may be decreased by 1=3when given with valproate. 2001; 42:750-3. 320Goodwin Simon Kalviainen N, et al.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of dobutamine in pregnant women. Dobutamine is a direct-acting b-adrenergic ionotropic agent producing a pressor effect with less chronotropy than the b-adrenergic agents, plus some degree of vasodilation (e.g., pulmonary vascular resistance) but nodopaminergic renal effects. Dobutamine is recommended for ionotropic support of women with cardiac decompensationduring pregnancy. It is used to improve ventricular function in 321women with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Dobutamine can also induce a modest but unsustained increase in cardiac output in patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. The diagnosis of peripartal cardiomyopathy is limited to women withCHF and decreased LV systolic function during the last month of pregnancy or within 5mo of delivery. Women whose ventricular function is normal at rest and exercise may have theirdobutamine tapered and ultimately discontinued after 6-12mo. Thedobutamine challenge test is used to assess ventricular function in women with a history of peripartal cardiomyopathywho have regained normal resting LV size and performance.Digoxin is recommended prior to dobutamine when treatment is necessary for atrial fibrillation. Side effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, phlebitis, hypotension, N/V, angina, and VF. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of dopamine in pregnant women. Dopamine is a natural catecholamine that produces both positive chronotropic and inotropic effects. Several investigators have applied its vasodilating properties to the treatment of preeclamptic hypertension. A low-dose infusion of dopamine aids the management of acute renal failure caused by preeclampsia. A treatment program of IV fluids, furosemide, and/or dopamine has been suggested for preeclamptic women with anuria (output <100ml/24h). If unsuccessful, early dialysis should be considered. The evidence for the use of prophylactic medical interventions (e.g., the use of loop diuretics, mannitol, and low-dose dopamine ), is poor. Studies in monkeys report both increased and decreased uterine blood flow depending on dose. Side effects include anaphylaxis, asthma, gangrene, and piloerection. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. There are specific dopamine receptors on the human placenta.

It isunknown whether dopamine enters human breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Cyclopropane or halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics increasecardiac autonomic irritability and may sensitize the myocardiumto catecholamines such as dopamine. This interaction is related to both the pressor and the b-adrenergic stimulating activities of these catecholamines, and may produce ventricular arrhythmiasand hypertension. Animal studies suggest that dopamine -induced ventricular arrythmias during anesthesia can be reversed by propranolol. MAO inhibition prolongs and potentiates the effect of dopamine. Patients who have received a MAOI within 2-3w of requiringdopamine should begin at 1=10of the initial dose. Low-dose dopamine and diuretic agents may produce an additive effect on urine flow.TCAs may potentiate the CV effects of adrenergic agents.Cardiac effects antagonized by b-adrenergic blocking agents, such as propranolol andmetoprolol. The peripheral vasoconstriction caused by high doses of dopamine is antagonized by a-adrenergic blocking agents. Dopamine -induced renal and mesenteric is not antagonized as haloperidol can suppress the dopaminergic renal and mesenteric vasodilation induced with low-dose dopamine infusion. Use with vasoconstricting agents (such as ergonovine ) and some oxytocic drugs may result in severe hypertension. Use of phenytoin plus dopamine has been associated with hypotension and bradycardia. #References .........................

Side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, anorexia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether doxepin crosses the human placenta. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. While only small amounts of doxepin and its active metabolite enter breast milk, one report described apnea and drowsiness though the neonatal plasma doxepin was just into the detectable range. Caution is suggested. #Drug Interactions ................ Metabolized by CYP2D6 (and CYP3A4 as a minor pathway).CYP2D6 is reduced in 7-10% of Caucasians (''poor metaoblizers''), causing higher than expected plasma concentrations of TCAs. Depending on the fraction of drugmetabolized by CYP2D6, the increase in plasma concentrationmay be small, or quite large (8-fold increase in plasma AUC of TCAs). Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 render normal metabolizers poormetabolizers. An individual who is stable on a given dose of aTCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 include those not metabolized by the enzyme (e.g., quinidine, cimetidine ) and those that are CYP2D6, they vary in the extent of inhibition. Clinical problems depend on the degree of inhibitionand the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Of particular 331importance, sufficient time must be allowed before initiating a TCA in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long t/2 of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5w).Use of TCAs with drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 may require lowerdoses than usually prescribed for either drug. The dose of TCA may need to be increased if the other drug is withdrawn. Thus, MAOIs should be discontinued at least 2w prior to the cautiousinitiation of therapy with doxepin. Serious side effects and even death have been reported following the concomitant use of certain drugs with MAOIs. In patients who are well-controlled on TCAs also receivingcimetidine, discontinuation of the cimetidine may decrease established steady-state TCA levels and compromise their therapeutic effects. Alcohol ingestion increases the danger inherent in any intentionalor unintentional doxepin overdosage. #References .........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of doxorubicin in pregnant women. Irreversible myocardial toxicity may occur during or months after therapy. ACEIs and dexrazoxane offer cardioprotection. Women with breast cancerdiagnosed during pregnancy are frequently treated during the 1st trimester of pregnancy with a complex regimen including fluorouracil, doxorubicin, andcyclophosphamide. Women with Hodgkin's lymphoma who survived without recurrence /C213y and who attempt pregnancy after combination chemotherapy including doxorubicin do not experience significant subfertility. Side effects neurotoxicity. #Fetal Considerations ........... Though there are no adequate reports or well-controlled studiesin human fetuses, there are numerous uncontrolled series and case reports whose interpretations are complicated by the factthatdoxorubicin is often given with other agents. There is no firm evidence of teratogenicity or perinatal myocardial dysfunction in fetuses of women treated with doxorubicin. Women treated during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy experience little increase in the rate of complication during laborand delivery, and their neonates do well. There is essentially no long-term follow-up of exposed fetuses. Doxorubicin is associated with a series of anomalies in rats similar to VATER\u2014esophageal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula, and cloacal and urogenital anomalies. .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. Doxorubicin is concentrated in human breast milk, achieving maximum M:P ratios approximating 4.4.However, the maximum concentration of active drugapproximates 0.24mg/L. Thus, the amount ingested by thebreastfeeding neonate would be insignificant. #Drug Interactions ................ Extensively metabolized by the liver. Toxicities associated withdoxorubicin may be increased when used in combination with other cytotoxic drugs.There are reports that paclitaxel infused over 24h followed by doxorubicin administered over 48h resulted in a significant decrease in doxorubicin clearance with more profound neutropenic and stomatitis episodes than the reverse sequence.In one study where progesterone was given to patients with advanced malignancies at high doses coupled with a fixeddoxorubicin dose, the authors noted enhanced doxorubicin - induced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.Cyclosporine may increase the AUC for both doxorubicin and doxorubicinol, possibly due to a decrease in clearance of parentdrug and a decrease in metabolism of doxorubicinol causing more profound and prolonged hematologic toxicity. Coma and/or seizures have also been described.In a clinical study of women with metastatic breast cancer, the concurrent use of the cardioprotectant dexrazoxane and a regimen of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, andcyclophosphamide was associated with a lower tumor response rate. 333Necrotizing colitis manifested by cecal inflammation, bloody stools, and severe and sometimes fatal infections has been associated with a combination of doxorubicin andcytarabine. Cyclophosphamide may increase the level of doxorubicinol, which has only 5% of the cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin. Concurrent treatment with doxorubicin has been reported to exacerbate cyclophosphamide -induced hemorrhagic cystitis. AML has been reported as a second malignancy after treatment with doxorubicin andcyclophosphamide. Phenobarbital increases the elimination of doxorubicin. Phenytoin levels may be decreased by doxorubicin. Streptozocin may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of doxorubicin. mucosal toxicity when 1:75.Egan PC, Costanza ME, P, Theriault RL.

There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether dronabinol enters human breast milk. Breastfeeding is contraindicated in HIV-infected nursing womenwhere formula is available to reduce the risk of neonataltransmission. #Drug Interactions ................ Cannabinoids may interact with other medications through bothmetabolic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms. Dronabinol is highly protein bound and therefore might displace other protein- bound drugs. Practitioners should monitor patients for a change in dose requirements when administering dronabinol to patients receiving other, highly protein-bound drugs.Amphetamines, cocaine, and other sympathomimetic agents may produce an additive hypertension, tachycardia, and possiblycardiotoxicity.Atropine, scopolamine, antihistamines, and other anticholinergic agents may super-additive tachycardia, and drowsiness.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofdroperidol in pregnant women. It has been used in emergency 337rooms for the acute management of migraine headache with success similar to meperidine. Droperidol, propofol, and alizapride, in decreasing order of effectiveness for the doses used in this study, reduced the incidence of pruritus induced by the use ofintrathecal morphine. In addition, droperidol reduces N/V after epidural morphine similar in efficacy to dexamethasone. The addition of metoclopramide appears to enhance its efficacy. In one study, it was inferior to granisetron after cesarean section. There is a black box warning currently issued by the FDA based on reports of prolonged QT-associated dysrhythmia. However, the dozens of cases reported to the FDA were in fact multiple reports of 3 cases.Side effects include tardive nightmares, fever, and hypertension. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether droperidol crosses the human placenta. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. Neonatal mortality was increased perhaps because of maternal neglect. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether droperidol enters human breast milk. However, considering the indications, its short-term use is unlikely to pose a significant risk to the breastfeeding neonate. #Drug Interactions ................ Any drug with the potential to prolong the QT interval shouldnot be used with droperidol. Possible pharmacodynamic interactions can occur between droperidol and class I or III antiarrhythmics, antihistamines that prolong QT interval,antimalarials, that prolongthe QT interval, and antidepressants.Caution is indicated using drugs known to induce hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia as they may precipitate QT prolongation. These include diuretics, and supraphysiologic and general anesthetics) have additive or potentiating effects. When patients have received such drugs, the dose ofdroperidol must be reduced. After the administration of droperidol, the dose of other CNS-depressant drugs should also be reduced. #References .........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of efavirenz in pregnant women. However, there are several case series of HIV-infected women who have conceived while taking efavirenz. It is common practice to switch women on efavirenz to another NNRTI. The vast majority of these pregnancies areunintended, stressing the importance of contraceptive counseling.Hepatotoxicity may be more common during pregnancy. Perhapsthe most relevant consideration when initiating a pregnant woman on an NNRTI is whether normally tolerated side effects will be magnified by pregnancy.Side effects include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, dermatitis, erythema multiforme, rash, fever, and hepatic dysfunction. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Efavirenz crosses the placenta, achieving an F:M ratio approximating unity. Its use has been associated withCNS malformations in monkey fetuses at doses that approximatethose in humans, and with NTDs in exposed human fetuses. These studies led to a reclassification of the drug to category D. Rodent studies reveal an increased frequency of reabsorptions. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Efavirenz enters human breast milk. In one study with a mean efavirenz maternal plasma concentration of 6.6 mg/L, the milk concentration was 3.5 mg/L and the infant plasma level was0.9 mg/L. Breastfeeding is general ly contraindicated in HIV-infected women where formula is available to reduce the risk of neonatal transmission. However, none of the children studied became infected while breastfeeding. Efavirenz is excreted in the breast milk of rats. Interactions ................ Efavirenz is a CYP3A4 inducer. Thus, substrates of CYP3A4 may have lower than normal plasma concentrations when used intandem. It also inhibits CYP2C9, 2C19, and 3A4. Co-administration of drugs primarily metabolized by these isozymes may result in altered plasma concentrations of theco-administered drug, inhibitor in combination with efavirenz. Ritonavir increases the efavirenz concentration. The combination results in a higher frequency of adverse clinical affects (e.g., dizziness, nausea, paresthesia) and laboratory abnormalities (elevated liver enzymes). #References .........................

Relative to laboratory-tested species, the human fetus has higher vulnerability to enalapril and other ACEIs, exhibiting a syndrome not seen in experimental animals because humans develop these systems prior to calvarial ossification at the end of1st trimester. Exposure to agents that interfere with angiotensin actions are associated with cranial hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or renal failure, death, oligohydramnios, prematurity,IUGR, and patent ductus arteriosus, even in the 1st trimester. Longterm renal disease is reported in survivors. Enalapril produces fetal hypotension in rhesus macaques. 344#Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. Trace amounts of enalapril are detected in breast milk, though the kinetics remain to be elucidated. Untilfurther study, the infant should be monitored for possible adverseeffects, the drug given at the lowest effective dose, and breastfeeding avoided at times of peak drug levels if breastfeeding continues. #Drug Interactions ................ Diuretics, especially if recently begun, may be associated with hypotension after initiation of enalapril . The possibility can be minimized by volume loading, discontinuing the diuretic, or increasing salt intake before enalapril .

The incidence of PE and DVT is higher in pregnant compared to nonpregnant patients, reaching a rate of 0.05-1% in allpregnancies, and as high as 3% after cesarean section. Pregnancy increases the clearance of both heparin and low-MW heparinoids such as enoxaparin requiring periodic monitoring throughout pregnancy (anti-Xa activity of 0.20-0.40U/ml for prophylaxis, and 0.4-0.7U/ml for full anticoagulation). The mean maximum dose required to achieve a therapeutic anti-Xa level at 5-6h after injection in one study was 38.1mg every 12h (range 30-75mgevery 12h). The mean anti-Xa level was 0.28IU/ml (median 0.3,range 0.05-0.8IU/ml). The risk of osteoporosis is similar to unfractionated heparin, though the risk of thrombocytopenia may be lower. Acute thrombosis should be treated with therapeutic anticoagulation for the remainder of pregnancy and for at least 6w postpartum (a minimum of 3mo total). One as-yet unconfirmed report suggests the addition ofenoxaparin to the therapy of women with gestational hypertension may have a beneficial effect on uterine blood flow. Enoxaparin has also been used for prophylaxis during pregnancy in women with thrombophilia or mechanical heart valve or antiphospholipid syndrome. There have been multiple deaths oftreated pregnant women with a mechanical heart valve, and the manufacturer specifically discourages its use for this indication. Women treated with LMWHs for prevention of thromboemboliccomplications are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma after neuraxial anesthesia. Unlike unfractionated is not Preferably, LMWHs are replaced with unfractionated heparin at 34836w. Otherwise, patients should be instructed to withhold their next injection once contractions begin, or 12h prior to a planned induction of labor. Enoxaparin should be discontinued 12-24h (depending on daily dose) before placement of neuraxial (epidural or spinal) anesthesia. Enoxaparin should not be (re)instituted until at least 12h after removal of an indwellingepidural catheter.Side effects include epidural/spinal hematoma, thrombocytopenia, paralysis, CHF, hemorrhage, fever, or bruising, hematuria, and #Fetal Considerations unfractionated heparin crosses the human placenta, and thus enoxaparin does not pose a direct risk to the human fetus.

But whileinterventions such as colloids, ephedrine, phenylephrine, or lower leg compression reduce the incidence of hypotension, none has been shown to eliminate the need to treat maternal hypotension during spinal anesthesia for cesarean section.Women with preeclampsia are less likely to experience hypotension at the time of spinal anesthesia, and require significantly less ephedrine when they do. Side effects include arrhythmias, insomnia, nervousness, dizziness, and tachycardia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. Ephedrine apparently crosses the placenta, though the kinetics remain to be elucidated. Rodent teratogenicity studies have not been conducted. The long clinical experience with the drug, both in OTC preparations and in the labor suite, is reassuring. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Ephedrine is excreted and concentrated into breast milk, but <1% of the ingested dose is excreted. Thus, it is generally considered safe for breastfeeding women. However, a single dose of pseudoephedrine reduces 24h milk production by as much as 25%. #Drug Interactions ................ Bromocriptine may increase the risk of hypertension, stroke, and MI. Cyclobenazaprine may decrease the pressor effect. Atomoxetine may increase the pressor response.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether eprosartan crosses the 354human placenta. Similar class drugs are known teratogens. While no adverse fetal effects are reported after 1st trimester exposure, later exposure to agents that interfere with angiotensin action is associated with cranial hypoplasia, anuria, reversible ductus arteriosus. This ''ACEI fetopathy'' does not have a counterpart in experimental animals because humansdevelop these systems prior to calvarial ossification at the end of1st trimester. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

Ergocalciferol is converted in the liver to 25-hydroxyergocalciferol and then in the kidney to the active 1,25-dihydroxyergocalciferol. #Dosage with Qualifiers CVD #Maternal Considerations ..... The recommended minimal daily requirement of vitamin D is 400U. The safety of larger doses is unknown. Ergocalciferol is a synthetic regulator of calcium. There are few well-controlled studies of ergocalciferol in pregnant women. Oral supplementation of vitamin D deficient women does raise serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentrations. There is a long clinical experience of ergocalciferol supplementation during pregnancy and lactation without complications. Meta-analysis suggestssupplementation with ergocalciferol reduces the risk of a fall in the elderly by more than 20%.Side effects include hypercalcemia, N/V, anorexia, anemia, weakness, and renal dysfunction. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether ergocalciferol crosses the human placenta. Maternal vitamin D supplementation does not significantly increase the neonatal level. Ergocalciferol or a metabolite crosses the rodent placenta. Hypervitaminosis D has been associated with a syndrome characterized by supravalvularaortic stenosis, elfin facies, and mental retardation. Rare reports in fetal rats suggesting anomalous bone development when administered in high doses with cortisone. Neonates with low vitamin D have low levels of IL-10, a marker for future allergies. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. It is unknown whether ergocalciferol enters human breast milk. Vitamin D is a normal component of breast milk, and ergocalciferol has little effect on vitamin D metabolites in human breast milk. It is likely simple supplementation is safe during lactation. However, there is a single case report ofa woman given large doses of vitamin D where 25-hydroxycholecalciferol was identified in her breast milk and the neonate developed hypercalcemia. #Drug Interactions ................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inpregnant women. Ergotamine is a highly active uterine contractile agonist. Inadvertent use may lead to abortion. Epidemiologic study reveals an increased prevalence of preterm birth and IUGR in ergotamine users. Ergotamine produces constriction of both arteries and veins. It causes constriction of peripheral and cranial blood vessels and depresses the centralvasomotor centers. The pain of a migraine attack is believed secondary to greatly increased amplitude of pulsations in the cranial arteries, especially the meningeal branches of the externalcarotid artery. Ergotamine reduces extracranial blood flow, decreases the amplitude of pulsation in the cranial arteries, and decreases hyperperfusion of the territory of the basilar artery. It is effective in controlling up to 70% of acute migraine attacks andis considered specific for the treatment of this headache syndrome. Atropine or antiemetic compounds of the phenothiazine group may relieve the associated N/V. There is a case report of its association with maternal MI following anergotamine -associated abortion. Side effects include nausea, vomiting (up to 10%), leg weakness, myalgia, numbness and paresthesias of the fingers and toes,precordial pain, transient changes in heart rate, edema, and pruritus. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether ergotamine crosses the human placenta. While there is no clear evidence it is a teratogen,the severe vasoconstriction associated with toxicity could lead to profound fetal hypoxia and death. It has also been associated with Mo\u00a8bius' syndrome. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Ergotamine is excreted into human breast milk. Theoretically, excessive dosing or prolonged administration ofergotamine might inhibit lactation. Though generally considered incompatible with breastfeeding, the only published study foundno effect on milk production or infant weight gain. 357#Drug Interactions ................

Prolongation of the latency interval is not synonymous with irradication of inflammation. Inone study, the administration of both erythromycin and ampicillin rarely eradicated intra-amniotic infection in patients with PPROM. In addition, intra-amniotic inflammationdeveloped in 1=3of women who did not have inflammation on admission despite antibiotic therapy. However, there was a subgroup of women with documented inflammation who demonstrated a decrease in the intensity of the inflammatoryprocess after antibiotic administration. This group likely accountsfor the beneficial effects of erythromycin on the latency interval. Erythromycin reduces the frequency of preterm delivery in women with either asymptomatic bacteriuria or symptomaticlower genital tract infections. However, the practice of routinescreening for BV in asymptomatic women who are at low risk for preterm delivery cannot be supported based on evidence from the literature. The frequency of GBS resistance renders it a poorselection for prophylaxis. Erythromycin is an effective alternative therapy for the treatment of chlamydial infection. Partnertreatment is, overall, cost-effective among women ages 15-29.Though an alternative for the treatment of syphilis in penicillin-allergic patients, placental transport is low ( <5%). Thus, erythromycin is not recommended for the treatment of syphilis during pregnancy. Penicillin-allergic women should bedesensitized.Recently, a relationship between oral erythromycin and sudden cardiac death was reported in patients also receiving stronginhibitors of CYP3A such as nitroimidazole antifungal agents,diltiazem, verapamil, doubles, at least, the AUC for a CYP3A substrate. The potential implication forobstetrics is real with the growing use of nifedipine as a tocolytic agent in women who may also be treated with antibiotics forpreterm PROM. Although not included in the referenced study, nifedipine is also a substrate for CYP3A, suggesting the likelihood for some interaction is high. Side include hepatic transaminases. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Erythromycin crosses the human placenta, achieving an F:M concentration ratio of 0.3. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. Erythromycin is excreted into human breast milk, achieving an M:P ratio approximating unity. Rodent studiesare reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. 359#Drug Interactions ................

Depression is common during and after pregnancy but often goes unrecognized. Pregnancy is not a reason a priori to discontinue psychotropic drugs. Escitalopram is the pure ( S-) enantiomer (single isomer) of the racemic citalopram. The published experience with escitalopram during pregnancy consists mostly of inadequately documented case reports. Limited study suggests increased metabolism during the second half of pregnancy. As for most psychotropic drugs, using monotherapy and the lowest effective quantity given in divided doses to minimize the peakscan minimize the risks.Side effects include serotonin syndrome, withdrawal syndrome, mania, hyponatremia, insomnia, sweating, fatigue,dizziness, andabdominal pain. ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. It is unknown whether escitalopram crosses the human placenta. Citalopram does cross the isolated, perfused human placenta with a mean steady-state transfer rate of 9%. The transferis significantly lower compared with fluoxetine, which suggests lower fetal exposure will occur with citalopram. In contrast, umbilical cord serum measurements reveal that the highestcord:maternal ratios were seen with citalopram andfluoxetine compared to sertraline andparoxetine. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. Maternal toxicity, observed at most tested doses, was associated with IUGR. Incontrast, the administration of citalopram was associated with CV and skeletal defects. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknownwhether escitalopram enters human breast milk. Racemic citalopram enters human breast milk, and in one study citalopram and its metabolite M:P ratios were 2:3, but infant citalopram and metabolite plasma concentrations were very low or undetectable. However, there are two reports of infants experiencing somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss when breastfed by a citalopram -treated mother. Caution is advised. 361#Drug Interactions ................ In vitro studies indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of escitalopram. However, because escitalopram is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease escitalopram clearance. Use with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, is associated with a decrease the ketoconazole Cmaxand AUC by 21% and 10%, a 39%, respectively.There are rare post-marketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of an SSRI and sumatriptan. Increases the C maxand AUC of metroprolol by 50% and 82%, respectively. However, co-administration reportedly has no clinically significant effects on BP or heart rate. Platelet release of serotonin has an important role in hemostasis.Epidemiologic studies suggest an association between serotonin reuptake inhibitors and upper GI bleeding, especially with NSAIDs or aspirin. #References .........................

Esmolol crosses the human placenta, and fetal bradycardia may continue days after delivery despite the short effect in adults. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. Maternal toxicity is associatedwith embryo lethality. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether esmolol is excreted into breast milk. #Drug Interactions Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine ) may have an additive effect when given with b-blocking agents. May increase digoxin concentration. Morphine increases plasma levels of esmolol by almost 50%. May prolong the duration of neuromuscular blockade ofsuccinylcholine.Patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction may be morereactive to repeat challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic, while taking b-blockers. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction. Fatal cardiac arrest has occurred in patients with depressed myocardial function taking esmolol andverapamil.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Esomeprazole is cost-effective compared with omeprazole in the acute treatment of reflux esophagitis and GERD withoutesophagitis. These drugs are being used with increasing frequency during pregnancy, and there is a great need for additional study.Side effects include hepatic dysfunction, diarrhea, and headache. #Fetal Considerations ........... It is unknown whether esomeprazole crosses the human placenta. The F:M ratio of omeprazole at steady state in sheep is about 0.5. The findings of an epidemiologic study including 600 pregnanciesis reassuring. In another study run by the European Network of Teratology Information Services, the rates of major anomalies was compared among pregnant women exposed to omeprazole, lanzoprazole, orpantoprazole and a control group. They followed 295 pregnancies exposed to omeprazole (233 in the 1st trimester [T1]), 62 to lansoprazole (55 in T1) and 53 to pantoprazole (47 in T1), along with 868 controls. The rates of major congenital anomalies did not differ between the exposed and control groups and there were no differences when exposure was limited to the 1st trimester after exclusion of genetic,cytogenetic, or infectious anomalies. Rodent studies are likewisereassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknownwhether esomeprazole is excreted into breast milk. As esomeprazole is the L-isomer of omeprazole, the risks should be similar. #Drug Interactions ................ Extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Post-marketing reports describe changes in the PT of patients onwarfarin andesomeprazole. Increases in INR and PT may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin should be monitored frequently. Decreases the clearance of diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate, by almost half, causing increased plasma levels 12h after dosing and onward. However, interaction is unlikely to be of clinical relevance at that time since the plasma levels are subtherapeutic. May reduce the plasma levels of atazanavir. 364Inhibits gastric acid secretion and may interfere with the absorption of drugs whose bioavailability is affected by gastric pH (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts, digoxin ).

Estradiol is a naturally occurring estrogen, and as such may have a different risk profile than synthetic or phytoestrogens.It is commonly used for the short-term management of climacteric/postmenopausal symptoms. Conjugated estrogens and estradiol have comparable effects on hot flashes and may have similar short-term adverse effects. Recent studies suggest estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone for the treatment of menopausal symptoms increases the risk of breast cancer and CV disease.There are no indications for estradiol during pregnancy. The effect of estradiol on CV disease remains controversial. Side effects include thromboembolism, stroke, MI, endometrial and breast changes, to contact lenses, migraine, and rash. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. While diethylstilbestrol and other synthetic/environmental estrogens are recognized teratogens with the potential fortransgenerational effects, few studies support this effect fornaturally occurring substances like estradiol. There is no clear evidence of fetal harm after inadvertent exposure during the 1st trimester. Some studies have suggested prenatal exposure to estradiol might alter immune programming. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Though estradiol is excreted into breast milk and has been reported to reduce the amount of milk produced, it is noteffective as an inhibitor of lactation. All pharmacokinetic studieshave shown that the transfer to breast milk of both progesterone and estrogen when taking a contraceptive pill is of the same orderas natural hormones. Estrogen-containing contraceptives shouldbe initiated after the 6th week of lactation when the lipid profilehas returned to normal and the risk of thrombosis is identical to that of the general population. #Drug Interactions ................

Conjugated estrogens andestradiol have comparable effects on hot flashes and may have similar short-term adverse effects. Unopposed conjugated estrogens have been long known to increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Recent studies demonstrate that estrogen plus 368medroxyprogesterone for the treatment of menopausal symptoms does not increase the risk of endometrial cancer compared to placebo, but it does increase the risk of breast cancer and CV disease and may increase the risk of ovariancancer. Although conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone increases bone density and reduce the risk of fracture in healthy postmenopausal women, there is no nethealth benefit when the effects of hormone therapy on otherimportant disease outcomes are included in a global model, even in women at high risk of fracture. Many women use conjugated estrogens alone after hysterectomy. The findings of the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Trial reveal that the use of conjugated estrogens alone increases the risk of stroke by 30%, reduces the risk of hip fracture by 40%, and does not alter therisk of CV disease. There are no indications for conjugated estrogens during pregnancy.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of ethambutol in pregnant women. The published experience consists of relatively small to moderate sized series and casereports. However, untreated tuberculosis poses a significant threatto mother, fetus, and family. Adherence to treatment can bemade difficult because of a general fear of any medication and pregnancy-related nausea. What information exists suggests that all 4 first-line drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis ( isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, andpyrazinamide ) effects include thrombocytopenia, neuropathy (optic, peripheral), anorexia, N/V, joint pain, abdominal pain, fever,headache, hallucinations, pruritus, elevated LFTs. 373#Fetal Considerations ...........

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. While diethylstilbestrol and other synthetic/ environmental estrogens are recognized teratogens with the potential for transgenerational effects, few studies support this effect for naturally occurring substances like estradiol. There is no clear evidence of fetal harm after inadvertent exposure duringthe 1st trimester. Some studies have suggested prenatal exposure toestradiol might alter immune programming. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Though estradiol is excreted into breast milk and has been reported to reduce the amount of milk produced, it is not effective as an inhibitor of lactation. All pharmacokinetic studieshave shown that the transfer to breast milk of both progesterone and estrogen when taking a contraceptive pill is of the same order as natural hormones. Estrogen-containing contraceptives should be initiated after the 6th week of lactation when the lipid profilehas returned to normal and the risk of thrombosis is identical tothat of the general population. #Drug Interactions ................

Ethyl alcohol is one of the most commonly abused drugs during pregnancy. The patient may misrepresent ethyl alcohol use. Antenatal alcohol interviews have the greatest correlation with postnatal outcome and should be part of each prenatal record.Side effects include euphoria and intoxication. #Fetal Considerations ........... Ethyl alcohol is the most common teratogen (prevalence 0.5-2/1000 births) and typically reflects chronic consumption. In addition to the well-described fetal alcohol syndrome (pre- and postnatal IUGR, CNS anomalies, and a wide spectrum ofmalformations, the most typical being the craniofacial features),recent evidence suggests ethyl alcohol may decrease endothelial responses. Tobacco and/or cocaine use are synergistic in theiradverse fetal effects. The effects of antenatal exposure on braindevelopment are varied. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

It is a popular agent in some locales for use in epidural and spinalanesthesia. However, it is not used for labor epidural analgesia due to the motor block. There are no adequate reports or well- controlled studies of etidocaine in pregnant women. Tachycardia may be a sign of intravascular injection.Side effects include maternal hypotension, fetal bradycardia tachycardia, convulsions, nervousness,and light-headedness. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Etidocaine crosses the human placenta, achieving an F:M ratio approximating 0.3. Uterine blood flow is preserved in the absence of maternal hypotension. Local anesthetics cross when used for epidural, paracervical, pudendal, or caudal nerve blocks and may cause varying degrees of toxicity.

It is unknown whether etodolac crosses the human placenta. Other NSAIDs do cross. The pharmacologic profile suggests it is likely to have risks similar to those of indomethacin, including oligohydramnios and ductal constriction. Rodent studies performed at doses approximatingthe MRHD are associated with an increased prevalence of limb abnormalities. Higher doses delayed parturition and increased the perinatal loss rate. (See Indomethacin. ) #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is not known whether etodolac is excreted into human breast milk. (See Indomethacin. ) #Drug Interactions ................ NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACEIs.NSAIDs reduce renal clearance of lithium and increase the plasma levels. NSAIDs reduce renal elimination and increase plasma cyclosporine, digoxin, lithium, andmethotrexate. Nephrotoxicity associated with cyclosporine may also be increased. Antacids may decrease the peak concentration by 15-20%, but have no effect on the T max. Protein binding is reduced when administered with aspirin, although the clearance of free etodolac is not altered. It is recommended aspirin be avoided. May reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response is attributed to the inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Phenylbutazone increases (by about 80%) the free fraction of etodolac. Their combined use is not recommended. The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic. Short-term pK studies reveal the combined use ofwarfarin andetodolac results in decreased protein binding of 380warfarin, but no change in free warfarin clearance. There is no significant difference in the pharmacodynamic effect of warfarin administered alone and warfarin administered with etodolac as measured by PT. Thus, concomitant therapy should not require dosage adjustment of either drug. #References ......................... There is no published experience in ...........................

Epilepsy is a common neurologic disorder affecting 1 million American reproductive-age women. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of felbamate in pregnant women. Drug interactions between enzyme-inducing antiepilepticdrugs such as felbamate and hormonal contraceptives are well- documented, increasing the risk of an unplanned pregnancy.Using either a higher-hormone-content oral contraceptive or asecond contraceptive is suggested. Planned pregnancy is highlyrecommended, and counseling before conception crucial, covering folic acid supplementation, optimal control of seizure activity, monotherapy with the lowest effective antiepileptic drug dose,and medication adherence. Drug dose adjustments are often necessary during pregnancy and should be based on clinical symptoms and not solely on serum drug concentrations.Side effects include aplastic anemia, hepatic failure, anorexia, N/V, headache, insomnia, dizziness, somnolence, constipation, nervousness, tremor, diplopia, depression, abdominal pain, and ataxia. 387#Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether felbamate crosses the human placenta. It does cross the rodent placenta. Rodent studiesare reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity despite theuse of doses higher than those used clinically. IUGR was noted. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Felbamate is excreted into human breast milk, though the kinetics remain to be elucidated. Felbamate is excreted into rodent breast milk, and there is a higher death ratein breastfed pups. If breastfeeding continues, the infant should bemonitored for possible adverse effects, the drug given at thelowest effective dose, and breastfeeding avoided at times of peak drug levels. #Drug Interactions ................ The addition of felbamate to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) affects the steady-state concentrations of decreased 50%.AEDs can also alter felbamate concentrations. Phenytoin causes a near doubling of felbamate clearance at steady state and, therefore, a 45% decrease in steady-state trough concentrations compared to the same dose of felbamate given as monotherapy. Carbamazepine causes a 50% increase in felbamate clearance at steady state and, therefore, the addition of carbamazepine results in a 40% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations offelbamate compared to the same dose given as monotherapy. #References .........................

Felodipine decreases placental blood flow and prolongs parturition in rabbits.Side effects include edema, headache, flushing, dizziness, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, chest pain, palpitations,muscle cramps, and weakness. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether felodipine crosses the human placenta. Felodipine is associated with an increased prevalence of digital anomalies in rodents possibly secondary tothe observed decrease in placental blood flow. Prolongedparturition is associated with an increased perinatal mortality. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether felodipine enters human breast milk. It is excreted into rodent milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Felodipine is metabolized use (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, cimetidine ) may lead to a severalfold increase in plasma felodipine levels enhancing its effects (lower BP and increased HR).Maximum plasma concentrations of felodipine are considerably lower in epileptic patients on long-term anticonvulsant therapy(e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital ) compared to healthy volunteers. Since a clinically significant interaction maybe anticipated, alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered for these women. #References .........................

May increase the anticoagulant affect of warfarin -type drugs. Use with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be avoidedunless the benefit of further alterations in lipid levels is likely to outweigh the increased risk of the combination. Since bile acid sequestrants can bind drugs given concurrently,women should take fenofibrate at least 1h before or 4-6h after a bile acid-binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption.Because cyclosporine can produce nephrotoxicity with decreases in CrCl and increases in serum creatinine, and because renalexcretion is the primary elimination route of fibrate drugs 390including fenofibrate, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration in renal function. #References .........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of fenoldopam in pregnant women. In isolated systems, it causes relaxation of the rodent myometrium. Side effects include reflex tachycardia, MI, CHF, arrhythmias, leukocytosis, hypokalemia, headache, flushing, N/V, sweating, palpitations, constipation, and nasal congestion. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether fenoldopam crosses the human placenta. It relaxes thromboxane-constricted humanumbilical arteries.

Similar to other NSAIDs, it is effective for the relief of episiotomy pain. In rodents, fenoprofen prolongs parturition, and it reduces contractions of isolated myometrium from monkeys and humans. Side effects include anaphylaxis, GI bleeding, renal failure, bronchospasm, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, hepatic toxicity, dyspepsia, nausea, headache, constipation, abdominal pain, dizziness, rash, fluid retention, and tinnitus. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether fenoprofen crosses the human placenta. Fenoprofen prolongs gestation in rodents, as do other NSAIDs. It is otherwise poorly studied during pregnancy. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether fenoprofen enters human breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ NSAIDs can diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACEIs.Aspirin decreases the biologic t/2 of fenoprofen. Clinical studies and post-marketing observations show thatfenoprofen may reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides. Observe closely for signs of renal failure when diureticsare used with NSAIDs. 392NSAIDs increase plasma lithium and reduce renal lithium clearance. Patients should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. NSAIDs competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. Caution should be used when NSAIDs areadministered concomitantly with methotrexate. The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic. Chronic administration of phenobarbital may decrease the plasma t/2 of fenoprofen. A dosage adjustment of fenoprofen may be required if phenobarbital is added or withdrawn. In vitro studies reveal that fenoprofen may displace other drugs that are albumin bound from their binding sites. Patients receiving hydantoins, sulfonamides, or sulfonylureas should be observed for increased activity and, therefore, signs of toxicity from these drugs. #References .........................

Metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoform in the liver and intestinalmucosa to norfentanyl. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity mayincrease the bioavailability of oral fentanyl and decrease the systemic clearance. The expected clinical results would beincreased or prolonged opioid effects. Patients who begin or endtherapy with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as macrolide fentanyl should be monitored for a change in opioid effects. In contrast, agents that induce CYP3A4 activity (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort ) may increase clearance of fentanyl and reduce its efficacy. The concomitant use of fentanyl with other CNS depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics,phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.

Severe anemia may be an important cause of maternal death, but there is a lack of convincing evidenceregarding the risks of mild to moderate maternal anemia. OneRCT performed in the US on low-income women with adequate iron stores concluded that the mean birth weight was higher by 108g (p =.03), and the incidence of preterm delivery lower(8% vs 14%; p =.05) with supplementation compared to the control group. In this trial, iron supplementation did not alter the prevalence of SGA infants or 3rd trimester iron status.Women anemic due to iron deficiency should first receive areticulocytic dose followed by supplementation for the duration of pregnancy.

The features include brachycephaly, abnormal facies, abnormal calvarial development, cleft palate, femoral bowing, thin ribs and long bones, arthrogryposis andcongenital heart disease. Each was associated with chronic, parenteral use in the 1st trimester. Limited duration oral therapy is unlikely to pose a teratogenic risk. Fluconazole does not appear to increase the risks of IUGR or preterm delivery. It hasbeen used for the treatment of congenital candidiasis.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of fluorouracil in pregnant women. Fluorouracil is most commonly used during pregnancy in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters for thetreatment of metastatic breast cancer, where it is often combinedwith doxorubicin andcyclophosphamide (FAC). While it should be used only when there is significant risk for the mother's survival, breast cancer can be treated with FAC chemotherapy during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters without significant short-termcomplications for the majority of children exposed to chemotherapy in utero . Side effects include leukopenia, confusion. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Fluorouracil apparently crosses the human placenta, since maternal administration is associated with fetalimmunosuppression. The few published epidemiologic studiessupport multiple case reports of normal pregnancy outcome after early exposure. Little is known about the long-term effects of intrauterine exposure to fluorouracil. Fluorouracil crosses the rodent placenta and produces a variety of defects involving theskeleton and palate. It is embryotoxic to the rodent. The malformations associated with in utero exposure to FAC are highly variable, but growth deficiency and anomalies of the 408craniofacial region and limbs are most common. The pattern appears to be directly related to the age at and duration of exposure, rather than to the specific drug itself. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether fluorouracil enters human breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Leucovorin may enhance the 3:239-43.

Depression is common during and after pregnancy, but typically goes unrecognized. Pregnancy is not a reason a priori to discontinue psychotropic drugs. A fluoxetine dose of 20-40mg/d 409results in relatively low trough fluoxetine -norfluoxetine concentrations during pregnancy (range, 317-850nmol/L) and the mean norfluoxetine /fluoxetine metabolic ratio is 2.4 /C2higher during late pregnancy compared to 2mo postpartum. This suggests increased clearance, which can be explained at least in part by increased demethylation of fluoxetine by CYP2D6 and is consistent with the observation that many pregnant women require an increase in their dose to maintain clinical efficacy.Fluoxetine is effective treatment for postpartum depression, and is as effective as a course of cognitive-behavioral counseling in theshort term.Side effects include serotonin syndrome, insomnia, nausea, diarrhea, tremor, headache, anorexia, anxiety, dry mouth, decreased libido, delayed or absent orgasm, abnormal dreams, sedation, sweating, and itching. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Fluoxetine crosses the human placenta, achieving F:M ratios approximating 0.9. This is significantly higher than the ratios achieved with either sertraline orparoxetine and similar to citalopram. Maternal doses predict the umbilical cord concentration. Prospectively ascertained pregnancy outcomes afterSSRIs, mainly fluoxetine, conflict on the potential for a modest teratogenic effect. There are differences in birth weight and acute neonatal outcome between treated and untreated pregnancies. In one study of 20 pregnancies, there was a 4-fold difference in theserotonergic symptom score of newborns during the first 4d oflife between treated and control groups. The exposed infants had significantly lower cord blood 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5- HIAA) levels. There was an inverse correlation between theserotonergic symptom score and the umbilical vein 5-HIAA concentrations in the exposed infants. The long-term implications of these findings are unclear. Exposure throughout gestation doesnot adversely affect cognition, language development, or thetemperament of preschool and early school-age children. In sheep, fluoxetine has transient effects on fetal behavioral and acid-base status. Rodent studies too are reassuring from the standpoint of structural birth defects, though the rates of IUGRand stillbirth are higher in rats treated with multiples of the MRHD. Prolonged prenatal SSRI exposure in rats is associated with reduced behavioral pain responses and increasedparasympathetic cardiac modulation in recovery following an acute neonatal noxious event. However, a recent rodent study found that maternal exposure to fluoxetine has transient effects on fetal behavioral and acid-base status during pregnancy andlactation that result in enduring behavioral alterations in the pups throughout life. Others conclude that the behavioral affects are not permanent. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Maternal serum and peak breast milk concentrations of fluoxetine and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine, predict nursing infant serum norfluoxetine concentrations. The mean estimated infant exposure from the breast milk of women taking20-40mg/d to fluoxetine-norfluoxetine is 2.4% and 3.8% of the maternal at 2w and 2mo of age,respectively. Neonatal serum concentrations are typically low inwomen 20mg/d less. Thus, breastfeeding is not contraindicated. #Drug Interactions ................ Metabolized by CYP2D6. Some 7% of the population has a mutation causing reduced CYP2D6 activity. Such individuals are termed ''poor metabolizers.'' The pharmacokinetic properties and 410relative proportion of metabolites are altered in poor metabolizers. However, the sum of the plasma concentrations of the four active enantiomers of fluoxetine is comparable between poor and extensive metabolizers. Fluoxetine, like other agents metabolized by CYP2D6, also inhibits the activity of this isozyme, and thus may make normalmetabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. Medications with arelatively narrow therapeutic index that are metabolizedpredominantly by the CYP2D6 system should be initiated at the low end of the dose range if a patient is already receiving or has taken fluoxetine in the previous 5w. If fluoxetine is added to the regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized byCYP2D6, the dose of the original medication may need to be reduced. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index represent the greatest concern (e.g., flecainide, vinblastine, and TCAs). Due to the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden deathpotentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, thioridazine should not be administered with or within 5w of discontinuing fluoxetine. Patients on stable doses of phenytoin andcarbamazepine may developed elevated plasma levels and clinical anticonvulsanttoxicity after the addition of fluoxetine. Some clinical data suggest a possible pharmacodynamic and/orpharmacokinetic interaction between SSRIs and antipsychotics. Elevated levels of haloperidol andclozapine have been observed in patients also ingesting fluoxetine. Clinical studies of pimozide with other antidepressants demonstrate an increase in drug interaction or QTc prolongation. The potential for drug interactions or QTc prolongation warrants restricting the concurrent use of pimozide andfluoxetine. The t/2 of administered diazepam may be prolonged. Use with alprazolam may increase alprazolam plasma levels and compromise psychomotor performance decrement.There are reports of both increased and decreased lithium levels when used with fluoxetine. Lithium levels should be monitored when these drugs are administered concomitantly.Previously stable plasma levels of imipramine anddesipramine increased 2- to 10-fold in 2 studies when fluoxetine was added. This influence may persist for 3w or longer. There are rare post-marketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use ofan SSRI and sumatriptan. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role inhemostasis. Case-control and cohort design studies reveal anassociation between the use of drugs that interfere with serotoninreuptake and upper GI bleeding. They also show that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin potentiates the risk of bleeding. Increased bleeding has been reported when fluoxetine was used with warfarin . 2000; 48:996-1000.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Flurazepam crosses the human placenta, though the kinetics remain to be elucidated. Benzodiazepines such as diazepam andchlordiazepoxide may be associated with an increased risk of malformations after 1st trimester exposure.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Flurbiprofen crosses the human placenta. Other NSAIDs cause and oligohydramnios secondary to fetal oliguria. Flurbiprofen is known to do so in rats. Rodent studies are generally reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than that used clinically. High doses in the rodent areassociated with embryotoxicity and increased perinatal The elimination half-life of flurbiprofen during early lactation is slightly prolonged (mean 4.8h) compared to adult males. Thepeak plasma concentrations are comparable to those reported for healthy volunteers. In 10 of 12 women (3-5d postpartum), the flurbiprofen concentration in breast milk was less than 0.050mcg/ ml. The remaining women did not exceed 0.07mcg/ml. This concentration is insufficient to pose a risk to the breastfeeding neonate. #Drug Interactions ................ NSAIDs may decrease the antihypertensive of ACEIs. NSAIDs enhance the risk patients taking warfarin will suffer serious bleeding. Aspirin lowers serum flurbiprofen. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. Attenuates the hypotensive effect of propranolol but not atenolol; the underlying mechanism is unknown. NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients by inhibiting renal prostaglandin synthesis.NSAIDs can increase plasma lithium levels by reducing renal lithium clearance. Subjects should be observed carefully for signs oflithium toxicity. NSAIDs competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit renal slices. This may indicate they could enhance themethotrexate toxicity. #References ......................... Bloomfield SS, Mitchell J, Cissell J Med 1986;80:65-70. Smith #Summary ...........................

Differences in sensory attributes, experience during pregnancy, and cost may contribute to better patient acceptance of one versus another.

Side effects include adrenal suppression, bronchospasm, glaucoma, and pharyngitis. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether fluticasone crosses the human placenta. However, inhaled or nasal corticosteroids alone do not adversely affect fetal growth or placental function. While systemically administered corticosteroids, including fluticasone, are teratogenic in some rodents and a weak effect in humanscannot be excluded, the concentration of drug absorbed suggests the risk of an adverse fetal effect is low. There are no documented epidemiologic studies with IN corticosteroids duringpregnancy; however, inhaled corticosteroids have not beenincriminated as teratogens and are commonly used by pregnant 418women who have asthma.

Fluvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of fluvastatin in pregnant women. Hyperlipidemia is a chronic illness, and discontinuing treatment during pregnancy is unlikely to compromise patient care. Published experience is confined to a case report. However, there is an unexpected highmaternal mortality rate in rats during lactation. Supplementationwith mevalonic acid completely blocks and/or ameliorates death, cardiac myopathy, and other adverse effects. Thus, the adverse maternal effects result from exaggerated pharmacologic activityat the dose levels administered (i.e., inhibition of the enzymeHMG-CoA reductase, its immediate product mevalonic acid, and cholesterol biosynthesis). It is not known whether pregnancy enhances the toxicity of fluvastatin in humans. Side effects include pancreatitis, hepatic toxicity, rhabdomyolysis, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal myalgias, muscle weakness, and elevated CPK or LFTs. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is not known whether fluvastatin crosses the placenta. While lovastatin, simvastatin, andatorvastatin are inhibitors for P-glycoprotein and may be substrates for this transporter, fluvastatin andpravastatin consistently demonstrate no significant inhibition of P-glycoprotein. In rodents, fluvastatin is associated with delayed and abnormal skeletal development.There is one report of VATER in the child of a woman who tookfluvastatin during the 1st trimester. Similar-class drugs are associated with rare reports of malformations. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. Fluvastatin apparently enters human breast milk, as the manufacturer reports an M:P ratio of 2.0. The affect on the breastfeeding neonate is unknown. #Drug Interactions ................ CYP2C9 is fluvastatin metabolism (/C2475%), while CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 isozymes are involved to a much lesser extent (i.e., /C245% and /C2420%, respectively). If one pathway is inhibited, other pathways may compensate. CYP3A4 inhibitors/substrates such as cyclosporine, erythromycin, and itraconazole have minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics, confirming minor involvement of CYP3A4. In contrast, theadministration of fluvastatin with phenytoin increases both phenytoin andfluvastatin levels, suggesting CYP2C9 involvement. Use with or up to 4h after cholestyramine decreases the fluvastatin AUC by more than 50% and the C maxby 50-80%. However, use 4h after cholestyramine produces a clinically significant additive effect compared to either drug alone.Cyclosporine increases the fluvastatin AUC 1.9-fold and C max 1.3-fold compared to historical controls.A single morning dose of phenytoin increases the steady-state maxby 27% and AUC by 20%. Phenytoin levels should to be monitored closely when fluvastatin is initiated or its dosage changed.Increases the mean C maxand AUC of diclofenac by 60% 25%, max, AUC, and t/2 of glibenclamide in NIDDM patients by some 50%, 69%, and 121%, respectively.Glibenclamide increases the mean C maxand AUC of fluvastatin by 44% and therapy 420with glibenclamide (orglyburide ) and fluvastatin should continue to be monitored appropriately when their fluvastatin dose is increased to 40mg bid.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of fluvoxamine in pregnant women. It is chemically unrelated to the other SSRIs. The few published case reports suggest no adverse effects when used at recommended doses. Side effects include seizures, bradycardia, hepatic toxicity, toxic epidermal necrosis, withdrawal syndrome, sweating, flatulence, and palpitations. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Though the kinetics need further clarification, about one third of the maternal fluvoxamine dose crosses the human placenta and is excreted into the AF. This is about half of the placental transfer of fluoxetine . There is no evidence of teratogenicity or any other adverse effect in humans after 1st trimester exposure. A recent meta-analysis concluded that SSRIs do not increase the risk of major, CV, and minor 421malformations but do increase the risk of spontaneous abortion. However, newborns exposed to SSRI antidepressants toward the end of pregnancy can show signs of agitation, altered muscle tone, and breathing. These neonatal symptoms have been notedwith citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and An estimated 20-30% of newborns exposed to an SSRI toward the end of pregnancy are affected. The symptoms arevariously attributed to withdrawal or to the drug itself. There isno consensus on the treatment of affected newborns, but close monitoring is mandatory. SSRI antidepressants are not teratogenic in animals. Prolonged prenatal SSRI exposure in ratsis associated with reduced behavioral pain responses andincreased parasympathetic cardiac modulation in recovery following an acute neonatal noxious event. However, a recent rodent study found that maternal exposure to fluoxetine has transient effects on fetal behavioral and acid-base status duringpregnancy and lactation that resulted in enduring behavioral alterations in the pups throughout life. At higher doses, many pups died from a dilated cardiomyopathy. Others conclude thatthe behavioral affects are not permanent. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Fluvoxamine is excreted in low concentrations into human breast milk, but the resulting neonatal levels are below the limit of detection. #Drug Interactions ................ Smokers have a 25% increase in the metabolism of fluvoxamine compared to nonsmokers.Inhibits the following CYP isozymes known to be involved in the metabolism has a genetic defect causingreduced activity of CYP2D6. These individuals are termed ''poor metabolizers'' of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and TCAs. While none of those studied for drug interactions significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of fluvoxamine, an in vivo study of fluvoxamine single-dose pharmacokinetics in 13 poor metabolizers demonstrated increased mean max, AUC, and t/2 for fluvoxamine by 52%, 200%, and 62%, respectively, compared to ''extensive metabolizers.'' Caution is indicated in patients known to have reduced CYP2D6 activity and those taking drugs known to inhibit this isozyme (e.g., quinidine ). A clinically significant fluvoxamine interaction is possible with drugs having a narrow therapeutic ratio such as terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, levels and/or pharmacodynamic effects of the latter drug should be monitoredclosely, at least until steady-state conditions are reached. Increased carbamazepine levels and symptoms of toxicity are reported with fluvoxamine use. May increase serum clozapine levels ,increasing the risk of adverse eventsAs with other serotonergic drugs, lithium may enhance the serotonergic effects of fluvoxamine. Seizures have been reported. The combination should be used with caution.Increases methadone levels, with symptoms of opioid intoxication reported in 1 patient. Opioid withdrawal symptoms were reported after fluvoxamine discontinuation in another patient. Rare post-marketing reports describe weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination after using an SSRI and sumatriptan. Appropriate 422observation of the patient is advised if treatment with sumatriptan and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline ) is clinically indicated. In one study, a single 40mg dose of tacrine added to fluvoxamine 100mg/d administered at steady state was associated with 5- and 8-fold increases in tacrine Cmaxand AUC, respectively. Several subjects experienced N/V, sweating, anddiarrhea after co-administration, consistent with the cholinergiceffects of tacrine. Increased TCA levels occur after the co-administration offluvoxamine with either amitriptyline, clomipramine, or imipramine. Caution is indicated, and the dose of TCA may need to be reduced. Tryptophan may enhance the serotonergic effects of fluvoxamine, and the combination should therefore be used with caution. Severe vomiting has been reported.Bradycardia has been reported when used with diltiazem. Use of fluvoxamine andpropranolol resulted in a mean 5-fold increase (range 2-17) in minimum propranolol plasma concentrations.

Women who become pregnant before folate restorationis complete have an increased risk of folate insufficiency at conception and during pregnancy. As a consequence, they may be at increased risk of preterm birth. Recent epidemiologicinvestigation suggests a reduction in the rates of preterm birthand low birth weight since the introduction of widespread food fortification. Women with HIV also show improved pregnancy outcomes when supplemented with folate.Side effects include N/V, anorexia, flatulence, irritability, altered pattern, erythema, rash, and itching. #Fetal Considerations ........... NTDs and other pregnancy complications are linked toimpaired MTHFR function. Each doubling of the serum folate concentration roughly halves the risk of an NTD. It is suggested that high levels of folate supplementation might blunt the negative impact of antiepileptic drugs. More recently, evidencehas emerged that vitamin B 12deficiency also increases the risk of a child with an NTD. Placental folate transfer is notcompromised in IUGR pregnancies. Knockout of receptorsin mice, and knock-down of folate receptors by antisenseoligonucleotides at day 8, or antibodies to folate receptor, results in profound developmental abnormalities ranging from NTDs to neurocristopathies such as cleft lip and cleft palate, cardiac septaldefects, and eye defects. These abnormalities can be prevented bysupplying folate into cells via alternative pathways. The high prevalence of mutated MTHFR genotypes in spontaneously aborted embryos supports the potentially protective role of periconceptional folic acid supplementation. #Breastfeeding Safety withoutsupplementation.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of furosemide in pregnant women. It is one of the drugs of choice for the treatment of CHF and/or pulmonary edema duringpregnancy. High concentrations of furosemide dilate the capacitance vessels and assist the reduction in preload. The longclinical experience for the noted indications is reassuring. In onestudy of women with preeclampsia, furosemide caused a significant decrease in the intervillous blood flow. This likelyreflects an already contracted intravascular volume. In anotherstudy of women with hyperdynamic cardiac outputs (COs),furosemide initiated at 22w gestation decreased CO and stroke volume (1.2\u00b10.2L/min and 17\u00b13ml, respectively), whereas totalpulmonary resistance increased (101\u00b126 for all) after 2.9\u00b11.4w. However, the hemodynamic improvementdid not approach that expected for pregnancy. Thus, while furosemide improved the hyperdynamic circulation, it neither lowered BP nor caused clinically significant vasoconstriction. In rabbit studies, a high dose of furosemide was associated with unexplained maternal photosensitivity. ........... There no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Furosemide crosses the human placenta, achieving an F:M ratio approximating unity after 8-10h. It isunclear, however, how responsive the fetal kidney is to it, and the impact of gestational age on that response. Direct administration offurosemide for fetal therapy, typically in association with hydrops, has been frequently reported. However, nocorresponding diuresis has been documented. In rodents, an effect on newborn urine concentrating ability is reported after in utero exposure. An increased prevalence was also noted in one mouse study. Though fetal sheep absorb it from AF presumablyvia a transmembrane mechanism, direct administration fails to generate a fetal diuresis. In addition, there is no fetal diuresis after administration to the gravid ewe. In summary, the impact offurosemide on the fetus is unclear and likely small. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Furosemide does enter human breast milk, but the kinetics remain to be elucidated. It is unlikely one-time or limited use would cause harm during lactation. #Drug Interactions ................ May increase the ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics, especially in the presence of impaired renal function. Avoid this combination except in life-threatening situations. Should not be used concomitantly with ethacrynic acid because of the possibility of ototoxicity. Patients receiving high doses of salicylates, as in rheumatic disease, may experience salicylate toxicity at lower doses becauseof competitive renal excretory sites.May antagonize the skeletal muscle relaxing effect of tubocurarine and potentiate the action of succinylcholine. Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce lithium's renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.May add to or potentiate the therapeutic effect of other antihypertensive drugs. Potentiation occurs with ganglionic orperipheral adrenergic blocking drugs. May decrease arterial responsiveness to NE. However, NE may still be used effectively.Simultaneous administration of sucralfate may reduce the natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of furosemide. Patients receiving both drugs should be observed closely. The intake offurosemide andsucralfate should be separated by at least 2h. Indomethacin may reduce the natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of furosemide in some patients by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. #References .........................

Gabapentin is a 2nd-generation anticonvulsant used mainly as an adjunct. While there is little published experience during pregnancy and lactation, the limited study available suggests ahigher safety margin relative to 1st-generation agents. The impact of pregnancy upon gabapentin metabolism apparently has not been studied. The dose may require adjustment during pregnancy, and should be based on both serum concentrationand clinical symptoms. Gabapentin has been used for chronic headache during early pregnancy. While a relationship betweenhormones and seizure activity exists in many women, goodoptions for catamenial epilepsy remain elusive. And while interactions between enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants and contraceptives are well documented, this is not true forgabapentin. Patients should be counseled to plan pregnancy, and informed of the value of folate supplementation, the importance of medication adherence, and the risk of teratogenicity. Gabapentin has been given for Restless Leg Syndrome, a disorder reportedly increased during pregnancy, and appears to reduceboth the frequency and the severity of hot flashes in postmenopausal women in a dose-dependent manner. Side effects include leukopenia, dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, ataxia, tremor, blurred vision, N/V, nervousness, dysarthria, weight gain, and dyspepsia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Gabapentin crosses the human placenta, achieving a F:M ratio of 1.7 (range 1.3-2.1). Limited observations suggest activetransport of gabapentin, with accumulation in the fetus. This suggests the presence of L-type amino acid transporter 1 in theplacenta. There was no evidence of human teratogenicity in a small post-marketing study. Rodent studies reveal fetotoxicity and an increased prevalence of minor malformations, including skeletalabnormalities (skull, spine, and limbs) and hydronephrosis. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Gabapentin is excreted into human breast milk. 438In one series, the M:P ratio was 1.0 (range, 0.7-1.3) from 2w to 3mo. The infant dose was estimated at 0.2-1.3mg/kg/day, equivalent to 1.3-3.8% of the weight-normalized dose received by the mother. Thus, the drug is absorbed by the neonate. The plasmaconcentration in the breastfed infants was approximately 12% of the mother's plasma level, but no adverse effects were observed. Absent a larger experience, the infant should be monitored forpossible adverse effects, the drug given at the lowest effective dose,and breastfeeding avoided at times of peak drug levels. #Drug Interactions ................ Naproxen appears to Cmaxand AUC values may increase the mean gabapentin AUC. Cimetidine appears to modestly decrease the oral clearance of gabapentin by altering renal excretion of both gabapentin and creatinine.The C maxofnorethindrone is 13% higher when given with gabapentin, though this interaction is not expected to be of clinical importance.Antiacids reduce the bioavailability of gabapentin by about 20%. It is recommended that gabapentin be taken at least 2h after antiacid use. #References Bar-Oz a higher safety relative to1st-generation anticonvulsants. \u2014(Optimark) \u2014hemolytic anemia, renal insufficiency #Maternal Considerations .....

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Ganciclovir crosses the human placenta by passive diffusion. It has been administered directly toCMV-infected fetuses with sonographically detected sequelae 441and no clear success: the viral load declined but the fetus died. It also has been used to treat an infected fetus who developed primary CMV after maternal primary infection associated with a renal transplant. In this instance, the fetal CMV was reportedlyerradicated. Postnatally, ganciclovir remains the drug of choice for the treatment of symptomatic neonatal CMV; it is notcurative, but rather ameliorates sequelae. Ganciclovir is embryotoxic in rats and mice. In rabbits, it is associated with cleftpalate, micropthalmia, renal agenesis, and hydrocephaly. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Fetuses with brain or abdominal findings havethe worst prognoses and are potential candidates for fetal therapy. It is unknown whether ganciclovir enters human breast milk. Ganciclovir enters rat breast milk by passive diffusion, reaching near-maternal serum levels. However, it is usually considered compatible with breastfeeding considering its neonatal application. #Drug prior to ganciclovir. Theganciclovir AUC was not affected by the presence of didanosine when the 2 drugs were given together. AUC decreased 17 \u00b1 25% in the ofganciclovir.

AUC increased 53 \u00b1 91% in the presence of probenecid. Renal clearance of ganciclovir decreased 22 \u00b1 20%, which is consistent competition for renal tubular secretion.Generalized seizures have been reported in patients who received ganciclovir andimipenem-cilastatin. These drugs should not be used concomitantly unless the potential benefits outweigh therisks. Drugs that inhibit replication of rapidly dividing cell populations such as bone marrow, spermatogonia, and germinal layers of have additive toxicity when administered with ganciclovir.

There is no assurance that periodic monitoring of CK will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy and kidney damage.Caution should be exercised when anticoagulants are combinedwith gemfibrozil. The dose of the anticoagulant should be reduced to maintain the protime at the desired level.Use with repaglinide causes a significant increase in repaglinide levels. Patients taking repaglinide should not start gemfibrozil; patients taking gemfibrozil should not start taking repaglinide. Concomitant use may enhance and prolong the hypoglycemiceffect of repaglinide, and blood glucose levels should be monitored and repaglinide dose adjustments made as needed.

Gentamicin is commonly used in obstetric patients for the treatment of infections such as pyelonephritis. Though its clearance is increased during pregnancy and in the puerperium, routine monitoring of peak and trough levels is not required in otherwise healthy women with normal renal function. Coupledwith clindamycin, it remains standard for the treatment of puerperal endomyometritis. Once-daily treatment postpartum (5mg/kg) with clindamycin is as effective as and cheaper than tid dosing. Once the endometritis has resolved on IV therapy, there is no need for further oral therapy.Side effects edema, headache, diarrhea, dyspepsia, tinnitus, and elevated BUN/Cr. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Gentamicin crosses the human placenta, reaching an F:M ratio approximating unity. In rodents, placental transfer is greater early than late gestation. Gentamicin interferes with renal protein reabsorption in fetal rats, and depresses body weights, kidney weights, and median glomerular counts in newborn rats when administered systemically at multiples of the MRHD.However, the evidence for human fetal gentamicin toxicity is weak. In utero exposure to gentamicin does not appear to cause increase the risk of audiologic impairment. There is no evidenceto support the practice in some locales of using gentamicin for ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Gentamicin enters breast milk. In one study, the mean M:P gentamicin ratios were 0.11 and 0.44 at 1 and 7h, respectively., However, only trace amounts are absorbed by the breastfeeding child. #Drug Interactions ................

The hypoglycemic action of sulfonylureas may be potentiated bycertain drugs, including NSAIDs and other drugs that (e.g., salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, MAOIs, and b-adrenergic blocking agents). When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving 452glyburide, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia. The patient should be observed closely for loss of control after withdrawal of such drugs. Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead toloss of control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, andisoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving glyburide, the patient should be closely observed for loss of control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patientreceiving glyburide, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia. A possible interaction between glyburide andciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, has been reported, resulting in a potentiation of the hypoglycemic action of glyburide. The mechanism of action for this interaction is not known. A potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic agents leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported. Whether this interaction also occurs with the IV, topical, or vaginal preparations of miconazole is not known. Metformin: In a single-dose interaction study in NIDDM subjects, decreases in glyburide AUC and C maxwere observed, but were highly variable. The single-dose nature of this study, andthe lack of correlation between glyburide blood levels and pharmacodynamic effects, makes the clinical significance of thisinteraction uncertain. Co-administration of glyburide and metformin did not result in any changes in metformin or pharmacodynamics. #References ......................... Elliott 171:653-60.Goetzl L, Wilkins I.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of haloperidol in pregnant women. There is, however, a large body of experience during pregnancy suggesting a wide margin of safety. There is 1 case report of an overdose at 34w treatedsymptomatically without detectable adverse effect. There is another case report of neuroleptic malignant syndrome during pregnancy treated successfully with dantrolene andbromocriptine. Haloperidol has also been used to treat chorea gravidarum. It is similar to olanzapine for the treatment of schizophrenia in terms of compliance, symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms, and overallquality of life, but haloperidol costs significantly less. Side effects include arrhythmias, seizures, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, galactorrhea. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Haloperidol crosses the human placenta (65% of the maternal dose) and can be recovered from neonatal hair. In aseries of 188 women who consulted a drug information service after exposure to haloperidol (plus 27 exposed to a similar agent), there was no increase in birth defects, though the preterm birth rate was double that of the matched controls. Two exposedneonates had a limb abnormality. After maternal overdose, the 467fetus had an abnormal biophysical profile for 5d. Haloperidol is teratogenic in some rodents. In hamsters, it produces a variety of spinal abnormalities in a dose-dependent fashion. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Haloperidol enters human breast milk, and in breastfeeding infants may reach therapeutic levels. As it is unknown whether haloperidol poses a risk to the neonate, breastfeeding should be permitted only with caution. #Drug Interactions ................ An encephalopathic syndrome (characterized by weakness,lethargy, fever, tremulousness and confusion, extrapyramidalsymptoms, leukocytosis, and elevated serum enzymes, BUN, and fasting glucose) followed by irreversible brain damage is reported in a few patients treated with lithium plus haloperidol. A causal relationship between these events and the concomitantadministration of lithium andhaloperidol has not been established; however, patients receiving such combined therapyshould be monitored closely. #References .........................

It and relatedcompounds relax the myometrium both in vitro and in vivo. As a result, it should not be used for routine vaginal delivery. Halothane is no longer used routinely by anesthesiologists, who prefer newer agents that are not significantly metabolized by the liver. Halothane has been used for cesarean delivery and in instances when uterine relaxation is important, such as acute uterine inversion, placental entrapment, and cervical entrapmentof the after-coming head during vaginal breech delivery. Currently preferred agents include NO donors. Side effects include malignant hyperthermia, arrhythmia, tachycardia, cardiac arrest, prolonged QT interval, asystole, cyanosis, rigidity, hypotension, and Considerations ........... Halothane rapidly crosses the human placenta, reaching an F:M ratio approaching unity within minutes. Once considered acandidate anesthetic for fetal surgery, halothane decreases fetal cardiac output and placental blood flow, and increases totalvascular resistance in sheep. Placental vascular resistance increases out of proportion to systemic vascular resistance, shunting blood away from the site of gas exchange. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether halothane enters human breast milk. Considering the indication, one-time halothane use is unlikely to pose a clinically significant risk to the breastfeeding neonate. #Drug Interactions ................ Epinephrine and NE should be employed cautiously if at all with halothane since their simultaneous use may induce ventricular tachycardia or VF. Nondepolarizing relaxants and ganglionic blocking agents may be augmented by halothane. Clinical experience and animal experiments suggest that pancuronium should be given with caution to patients receiving chronic TCA therapy who are anesthetized with halothane as severe ventricular arrhythmias /C15Halothane can be used throughout pregnancy.

There are no reported adverse effects on motheror fetus. Women either traveling to areas where HAV is endemic,older than 30y with chronic liver disease, waiting for or who have received liver transplants, or working with nonhuman primates should be vaccinated. HAV vaccination of chronic HCV carrierwomen substantially reduces morbidity and mortality rates. 471The disease course is typically unaltered by pregnancy, though fulminant hepatitis is reported in the 3rd trimester. Immunoglobulin is a safe alternative for short-term protection. Side effects include anaphylaxis, local reaction, fever, rash, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of hepatitis A vaccine in human fetuses. HAV is rarely transmitted to the fetus, and is not a known teratogen.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. It is unknown whether hepatitis A vaccine enters human breast milk. It is likely the resulting antibodies do enter breast milk, but it is unknown whether they confer any immunity for the nursing newborn. The vaccine is generallyconsidered compatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................

Hepatitis B immune globulin is prepared from pooled plasma. Women who may benefit from inoculation include those exposed to household contacts, an infected sexual partner, and blood from infected individuals. Hepatitis B immune globulin is effective in reducing perinatal transmission of HBV to neonates born to infected women. Though there is controversy on whether the administration of immunoglobulin in the 3rd trimester reducestransmission when given antenatally to Hep Be antigen-positivewomen, it may be worthwhile. Hepatitis B immune globulin should be administered concomitantly with hepatitis B vaccine. Women previously vaccinated but subsequently exposed shouldhave their immune titers checked immediately, and be coveredwith immunoglobulin if they are low. Side effects include local reaction, swelling, erythema, headache, malaise, nausea, diarrhea, myalgia, and anaphylaxis. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofhepatitis B immune globulin in human fetuses. While animal studies have not been conducted, though there is no reason to expect the immunoglobulin to be harmful. Further, administration to susceptible women appears to reduce the incidence of neonatal HBV. Universal vaccination isrecommended postnatally. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofhepatitis B immune globulin in nursing women. Vaccinated women have higher immunoglobulin levels in their breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Although administration of hepatitis B immune globulin does not interfere with measles vaccination, it is not known whether itmay interfere with the immune response to other live virus vaccines. Therefore, vaccination with live virus vaccines should be deferred until approximately 3mo after administration ofhepatitis B immune globulin (human). It may be necessary to revaccinate persons who received immunoglobulin shortly after live virus vaccination. #References .........................

Hydralazine is one of the most widely used drug for the treatment of acute hypertension during pregnancy. Women with severe preeclampsia whose intravascular volume is contracted are at risk for hypotension. The risk is ameliorated by the administration of appropriate intravascular volume prior totreatment. It was suggested that the incidence of hypotension isincreased by the continuous infusion of hydralazine, but that observation may reflect a variety of other uncontrolled variablessuch as volume replacement and nursing protocols. Comparativestudy suggests other commonly used agents, such as nifedipine or labetolol, are equally effective in nulliparas for the control of hypertension with fewer hypotensive complications thanhydralazine in multiparas. In one recent randomized trial, mini- bolus doses of diazoxide (15mg) did not cause maternal hypotension as previously described and, compared tohydralazine, produced rapid control and reduced the number of episodes of persistent severe hypertension.Side effects include agranulocytosis, neutropenia, lupus-like syndrome, #Fetal ........... Hydralazine crosses the human placenta, and the F:M ratio can exceed unity. The impact of the therapeutic level on the humanfetus is unknown. Vascular resistance declines in the isolatedperfused placenta. Limited use during the 1st trimester reveals no evidence of teratogenicity. The impact of hydralazine on placental blood flow is variable and greatly influenced by the occurrence of hypotension. Rodent studies reveal that hydralazine is teratogenic in mice at 20-30 /C2the MRHD and possibly in rabbits at 10-15 /C2 the MRHD, but is not teratogenic in rats. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Low-dose diuretics are the most effective first-line treatment for the prevention of CV disease morbidity 477and mortality. Hydrochlorothiazide leads to potassium loss and a transient reduction in intravascular volume when first initiated. Thereafter, intravascular volume recovers. Thus, thiazides should not be initiated during pregnancy but may be continued ifalready in chronic use. These diuretics further reduce an already constricted maternal intravascular volume in women with preeclampsia and should be avoided in such women.Hydrochlorothiazide has been used during pregnancy for the treatment of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism. Side effects include the human placenta, achieving an F:M ratio approximating 0.5. It is concentrated in AF. While noevidence of teratogenicity has emerged during the long clinical experience, hydrochlorothiazide can cause neonatal electrolyte abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, and hyperglycemia when given around the time of delivery. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use ofdoses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

Some recommend discontinuing hydroxychloroquine in pregnant women with connective tissue diseases, even though it has long been used for malarial prophylaxis during pregnancy in malaria-infested areas.In one randomized trial, hydroxychloroquine was associated with a significant reduction in the number of flare episodes in womenwith SLE. Thus, it may be reasonable to continue the drugconsidering the terminal elimination t/2 may be up to 2mo, flaresof SLE occur after discontinuation, and flares are detrimental to pregnancy outcome.

About 5% of women report prenatal use of either ibuprofen or naproxen near conception or during pregnancy. In several different trials, the addition of hydrocodone significantly enhanced the analgesic efficacy of ibuprofen. In other trials, ibuprofen significantly reduced postabortal pain and was superior toacetaminophen for the treatment of postpartum pain and episiotomy after vaginal delivery. Prophylactic ibuprofen does not decrease the discomfort associated with IUD insertion. In one 490prospective case-control study, prenatal ibuprofen ornaproxen use increased the risk of spontaneous abortion by 80% (adjusted hazard ratio 1.8 [95% CI 1.0-3.2]). The association was stronger if the initial use was around conception or if it lasted more thana week. There is epidemiologic evidence linking it to PPH. Side effects include renal failure, fluid retention, dyspepsia, GI bronchospasm, thrombocytopenia, interstitial nephritis, hepatotoxicity, Stevens-Johnson LFTs, tinnitus, and drowsiness. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Ibuprofen crosses the human placenta and is found in meconium. Fetal levels are dependent on maternal, asNSAID agents are not metabolized by the fetal kidney.Constriction of the fetal ductus arteriosus is reported, and it issimilar in efficacy to indomethacin for closure of a neonatal PDA. There is epidemiologic evidence linking ibuprofen to gastroschisis. Similar adverse effects have been noted in ratswhere ibuprofen was associated with an increased prevalence of abdominal wall defects and VSD. Ibuprofen is as effective as indomethacin in closing the ductus arteriosus, but does not affect renal function to the same extent. In cows, ibuprofen actually enhances the rate of implantation. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Only small amounts of ibuprofen are excreted into human breast milk. Less than 1mg is excreted in the breast milk of lactating women who ingest up to 400mg q6h. #Drug Interactions ................ Increased bleeding has been reported when using ibuprofen and other NSAIDs with coumarin-type anticoagulants. Animal studies suggest that aspirin reduces the net anti- inflammatory activity of NSAIDs, including ibuprofen. Probably reduces tubular secretion of methotrexate and thus may increase methotrexate toxicity. May reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition ofrenal prostaglandin synthesis. Increases lithium levels some 15% by reducing renal lithium clearance 20%. This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. #References 2006; Burdan Res 2006;53:287-92.Cuzzolin L, Cere Fanos 2001; 24:9-18. Elli 121:151-4.

Class III antiarrhythmic drugs such as ibutilide cause a spectrum of malformations in experimental teratology studies very similar to those reported for phenytoin. Class III antiarrhythmics decrease cardiac cell excitability by selectively blocking the rapid component of the I Kr, an action shared with phenytoin. Malformations associated with selective and nonselective I Krblockers may be the dose-dependent product of embryonic bradycardia/arrhythmia resulting in (1) hypoxia,explaining embryonic death and growth restriction; (2) episodes of severe hypoxia, followed by generation of reactive oxygenspecies within the embryo during reoxygenation, causing orofacial clefts and distal digital reductions; and (3) alterations in embryonic blood flow and BP, inducing CV defects. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

Imipenem-cilastin is broad-spectrum combination that achieves excellent pelvic tissue levels. Because of the relatively high cost, it is not considered ''first-line'' therapy for most obstetric andgynecologic infections. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The clearance of imipenem-cilastin is increased during pregnancy. Limited study reveals good clinical responses in women with chorioamnionitis or PPROM. While imipenem-cilastin provides effective prophylaxis for women undergoing nonelective cesarean delivery, it is no better than any other antibiotic agent used for this purpose. The selection of an agent for cesarean sectionprophylaxis typically is based on cost.Side effects include pseudomembranous enterocolitis, seizures, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, rash, BUN/Cr, and N/V. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Imipenem-cilastin crosses the human placenta, achieving an F:M ratio of only 0.3, while the AF:F ratio is 0.6. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than thoseused clinically. Adverse outcomes in animal studies share anassociation with adverse maternal outcomes. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Limited concentrations of imipenem-cilastin are excreted into human breast milk, though the kinetics remain tobe elucidated. It is generally considered compatible withbreastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................

Depression is common during and after pregnancy but often goes unrecognized. Pregnancy is not a reason a priori to discontinue psychotropic drugs. Imipramine is the prototype TCA and is predominantly metabolized by hepatic CYP2D6. There are noadequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women.It has been used extensively during pregnancy for the treatment of depression. Imipramine has also been used during pregnancy for the treatment of panic attack. Side effects include MI, stroke, seizures, blood dyscrasias, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, dry mouth, drowsiness, confusion, disorientation, blurred vision, and increased appetite. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Imipramine binds to the placental serotonin 496transporter, and presumably crosses the human placenta. It rapidly crosses the rodent placenta and is distributed throughout the fetus. While rodent teratogenicity studies are generally reassuring, several behavioral studies suggest prenatal exposure toimipramine alters postnatal adrenergic responses, serotonin uptake, and the response to stress. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Imipramine is excreted into human breast milk, though the kinetics remain to be elucidated. It is estimated that,in women ingesting therapeutic doses of imipramine, the infant would ingest 0.2mg/L, or 30mcg/kg/d. Only about 3% of thematernal dose (per kg) of other tricyclics is consumed by the breastfed neonate. #Drug Interactions ................ CYP2D6 is reduced of Caucasians (about 7-10%) called ''poor metabolizers''. Reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced CYP2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African, and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers havehigher than expected plasma concentrations of TCAs when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the increase may be small or quite large.Certain drugs inhibit CYP2D6 and make normal metabolizersresemble poor ones. An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic if given one of these inhibiting drugs. CYP2D6 inhibitors include some that are notmetabolized by the enzyme (e.g., cimetidine, quinidine ) and many that are to greatly varying degrees. The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition. Caution is indicated whenusing TCAs with any of the SSRIs and when switching from oneclass to the other. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long t/2 (at least 5w may be necessary). #References .........................

IVimmune globulin (human) is a solvent/detergent treated, sterile, freeze-dried preparation of highly purified IgG derivedfrom large pools of human plasma. The manufacturing processdramatically reduces the risk of viral transmission. The t/2 ofimmune globulin approximates 38d. Epinephrine should be available for treatment of any acute anaphylactic reactions. Thereare few well-controlled studies in pregnant women, but severalon- and off-label indications deserve specific comment. In addition to the indications listed below, immune globulin has been used with apparent success during pregnancy for dermatomyositis, Churg-Strauss vasculitis, Guillain-Barre \u00b4 syndrome, ITP is a common hematologic disorder in young women. While ITP is a risk to both mother and neonate, there is no 499convincing evidence it poses a risk to the fetus. Cesarean delivery is not indicated for ITP. Alloimmune thrombocytopenia: It is now clear that maternal immune globulin therapy is primary treatment for fetal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. Empiric therapy (i.e., treatmentof at-risk fetuses without a definitive diagnosis) is cost-effective. A high-dose weekly infusion (1-3g/kg) reduces the severity of fetalalloimmune thrombocytopenia and the risk of a fetal intracranialhemorrhage. The concurrent use of dexamethasone is not of added value, though nonresponders to immune globulin may benefit from the addition of prednisone 60mg PO qd. The mechanism is unknown. Maternal immunoglobulin endothelial cells. The initial fetal platelet count predicts theresponse to therapy, but apparently not the family history.Children with fetal alloimmune thrombocytopenia treated as fetuses have better long-term developmental-behavioral outcomes than untreated siblings, perhaps because of higher in utero platelet counts. RBC alloimmunization: A number of pregnancies have been reported noting favorable outcomes with immune globulin (1-2g/ kg qw) treatment of women with severe Rh factor disease, though that conclusion is not unanimous. Several combine immune globulin therapy with plasmapheresis. One explanation for an improved outcome would be decreased hemolysis. In support,several groups document either a decreased need for transfusionor a reduced carboxyhemoglobin level in rH factor-immunized neonates after immune globulin therapy. While therapy does not typically eliminate the need for fetal transfusion, it does appear to delay the gestation in which it must be started. Recurrent abortion: The use of immune globulin in women with recurrent pregnancy loss remains controversial. In a recent meta- analysis, immune globulin was ineffective for the indication of primary recurrent abortion, but was associated with an increased the rate of live births in women with secondary recurrent miscarriage.Side effects include anaphylaxis, urticaria, hypotension, headache, fatigue, chills, backache, leg cramps, light-headedness, flushing, slight elevation of BP, N/V, thrombosis, aseptic meningitis syndrome, increased BUN/Cr, renal osmotic nephrosis, and death. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted.IVimmune globulin crosses the human placenta via the Fc 0 receptors on the syncytiotrophoblast, as do endogenousimmunoglobulins. However, not all commercial preparations haveequal transport. Using an in vitro placental perfusion model, there was significant inhibition of placental anti-D IgG transfer with three commercial immune globulin preparations where the circulating maternal IgG concentrations were >20g/L. One product, which was not inhibitory, had lower circulating IgG levels (16.5 \u00b1 0.9g/L) and significantly reduced placental transfer of total IgG, suggesting that the reduced functional activity of IgG from immune globulin preparations may correlate with poor clinical efficacy. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. It is unknown whether immune globulin enters human breast milk, though endogenous immunoglobulins are a normal component of breast milk. 500#Drug Interactions ................

Indinavir \u2014(Crixivan; MK-639) International Brand Name\u2014 3TC (Argentina, Canada, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Panama, South Africa, Uruguay); Crixivan (Hong Kong, Israel, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand);Elvenavir NOTE: dose for hepatic dysfunction./C15Contraindications \u2014hypersensitivity to drug Indinavir is effective reducing the maternal HIV viral load to an undetectable level, especially when combined with other agents such as a nucleoside analog or a reverse transcriptase inhibitor. In one study of 4 women, clearance was increased during pregnancy as reflected in the decreased AUC. In another longitudinal study,indinavir AUC was 68% lower antepartum compared to postpartum, suggesting increased intestinal and/or hepatic CYP3A activity during pregnancy. Side effects include nephrolithiasis, diabetes mellitus, N/V, diarrhea, abdominal pain, insomnia, headache,hyperbilirubinemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, anorexia, dry mouth, malaise, taste changes, and the lipodystrophy syndrome. #Fetal Considerations ........... Indinavir crosses the human placenta, though the magnitude of fetal-to-maternal transfer in the isolated cotyledon is 2-3 /C2greater than maternal-to-fetal transfer, suggesting fetal exposure is minimal. Transport is via P-glycoprotein. These in vitro findings are confirmed by umbilical cord blood samples. In one series, the majority of pregnancies treated had some adverse outcome, though the relationship of the retroviral therapies to the outcomewas unclear. Certainly, the prevention of HIV transmissionremains the ultimate priority. Though most premarketing rodent teratogenicity studies are reassuring, indinavir was associated in one study with delayed growth, and skeletal and ophthalmic abnormalities. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no adequate experience in nursing women. Indinavir does enter human breast milk, and in a single case the M:P ratiowas 5.4. It is excreted into rat breast milk. Regardless, breastfeeding is contraindicated in HIV-infected nursing women 503where formula is available to reduce the risk of neonatal transmission. #Drug Interactions ................ Delavirdine increases the indinavir plasma concentration and a dosage reduction may be indicated. Efavirenz decreases the indinavir plasma concentration and a dosage increase may be indicated. Itraconazole andketoconazole inhibit CYP3A4; both increase indinavir plasma concentrations and a dosage reduction of indinavir is recommended. There is an increase in the plasma rifabutin concentration and a decrease in the plasma indinavir concentration when both are given. The dosage of both drugs will require appropriate alteration. Should not be co-administered with rifampin . It is a potent CYP3A4 inducer that markedly reduces indinavir plasma concentrations. Interactions between indinavir and less potent CYP3A4 inducers such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and dexamethasone have not been studied. These agents should be used with caution. Calcium channel blockers are metabolized by CYP3A4, which isinhibited by indinavir. Use of indinavir with calcium channel blockers may result in increased concentrations of the calcium channel blockers that can increase or prolong their therapeutic and adverse effects.Indinavir anddidanosine should be administered on an empty stomach at least 1h apart as a normal gastric pH is necessary for optimal absorption. In contrast, acid rapidly degrades didanosine, which is formulated with buffering agents. #References ......................... Colebunders R, Hodossy B, et al. AIDS 1998; 12:F241-7.

Indomethacin is used off-label for the treatment of presumed preterm labor. In that scenario, it significantly prolongs gestation (48-72h), a degree similar to b-mimetic agents and, in small trials, magnesium sulfate. The latter is relevant since in meta-analyses magnesium sulfate is no better than placebo for tocolysis. The interval is adequate for the administration of corticosteroids toenhance fetal lung maturity. Indomethacin is no better and likely inferior to calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine, which has a stronger safety profile. Continuing indomethacin after the successful treatment of presumed preterm labor does not furtherdelay delivery or enhance outcome and should not be condoned. Similarly, indomethacin is advocated for the treatment of the sonographically detected short cervix. Here, too, there is little quality evidence to support the practice. It does not appear to delay preterm delivery of women with a dilated cervix independent of cerclage. Indomethacin has multiple non-prostaglandin-related actions, including the inhibition of MMPs 2 and 9 in amnion,chorion, and decidua. Such actions may contribute to its 505anti-inflammatory effect. Indomethacin reduces renal free water clearance and can cause abrupt maternal weight gain and edema when first initiated. Indomethacin should probably be avoided in women at risk for delivery within 24h, as a 50mg dose reproducibly prolongs the maternal bleeding time, in half of which cases will reach abnormal levels. Side effects include renal failure, fluid retention, dyspepsia, GI bleeding, bronchospasm, thrombocytopenia, interstitial nephritis,hepatotoxicity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, agranulocytosis, LFTs, and drowsiness. #Fetal Considerations ........... Indomethacin crosses the placenta, and fetal sequelae are common. Fetal levels are dependent on maternal, as NSAIDs arenot metabolized by the fetal kidney. A third of fetuses exposed toindomethacin for 1w or more develop oligohydramnios or evidence of ductal constriction. These adverse effects are completely avoidable as there are no demonstrable benefits over the long term for the indication of preterm labor or incompetentcervix. Other prostaglandin synthase inhibitors reputedly have a lower incidence of fetal sequelae when used as a tocolytic agent, though the quantity of clinical experience is much smaller thanthat for indomethacin. These differences are clear in the neonate when comparing ibuprofen toindomethacin for the closure of a PDA. Because of its effect on fetal urine output, indomethacin is used to treat idiopathic polyhydramnios. It should not, however,be used in twin gestations complicated by the so-called stucktwin, or the ''oligo-polyhydramnios sequence.'' In this scenario, there is no evidence that indomethacin prolongs gestation, and it can lead to fetal renal shutdown. The effects of indomethacin on the fetal kidneys are dose- and duration-dependent. Stopping ittypically results in reversal of the abnormal sonographic findings. Indomethacin is used postnatally for the pharmacologic closure of a PDA. Constriction of the fetal ductus is common whenindomethacin is used for the treatment of preterm labor. It, too, reverses with cessation, and the long-term impact of in utero ductal constriction on the otherwise healthy fetus is currentlyunknown. A short course ( <48h) of indomethacin for the treatment of preterm labor does not alter the newborn's responsiveness to indomethacin postnatally. In uncontrolled trials, indomethacin tocolysis was associated with an increased risk of IVH and NEC in the neonate. These reports remain to beconfirmed. In other uncontrolled studies, neurodevelopment was unaffected by antenatal exposure. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. The quantity of indomethacin excreted into human breast milk is low, such that the breastfed neonate would ingest <1% of the maternal dose per day. Neonatal plasma levels are typically below detection. #Drug Interactions ................ Diflunisal should not be used. It decreases the renal clearance and significantly increases the plasma concentration of indomethacin. Combined use has been associated with fatal GI hemorrhage. Should not be used with other NSAIDs. Chronic concurrent administration of aspirin decreases indomethacin concentration some 20%. Patients receiving oral anticoagulants should be observed for a change in their PT if indomethacin is added. Probenecid increases the indomethacin plasma level. Therefore, a lower total daily dosage of indomethacin may produce a satisfactory therapeutic effect. 506Decreases the tubular secretion of methotrexate and may potentiate its toxicity. NSAIDs increase cyclosporine -induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin. NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients taking cyclosporine, and renal function should be carefully monitored.A clinically relevant increase in the plasma lithium level results from a decrease in renal lithium clearance. This effect is attributed to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. May increase the serum concentration and prolong the t/2 of digoxin. Serum digoxin levels should be closely monitored when indomethacin anddigoxin are used together. In some patients, indomethacin reduces the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, andthiazide diuretics. The patient should be observed closely todetermine if the desired diuretic effect is obtained.Reduces basal plasma renin activity (PRA), as well as those elevations of PRA induced by furosemide or by salt or volume depletion. Should not be administered with triamterene as it may cause reversible acute renal failure.May cause hyperkalemia in patients on potassium-sparingdiuretics.NSAIDs may blunt the antihypertensive effect of b-adrenoceptor blockers. Patients should be observed carefully to confirm thedesired therapeutic effect.May reduce the antihypertensive effect of captopril.

All pregnant women >12w gestation should be vaccinated in preparation for influenza season. Pregnant women have increased susceptibility to viral respiratory diseases, and the most commonone is influenza. Influenza-associated excess mortality during pregnancy was documented during the pandemics of 1918-1919 and 1957-1958. The increased risk might result from (1)increased HR, stroke volume, and oxygen consumption; (2) decreased lung capacity; and (3) changes in immunologic function. A study during 17 interpandemic influenza seasonsrevealed that the relative risk for hospitalization forcardiorespiratory conditions during pregnancy increased from 1.4 between 14 and 20w gestation to 4.7 between 37 and 42w 509gestation, compared to women 1-6mo postpartum. Researchers estimate that an average of 1-2 hospitalizations can be prevented for every 1000 pregnant women vaccinated. Thus, all women who intend to become pregnant or are pregnant should receive theinfluenza vaccine. Vaccination can occur in any trimester. One study of influenza vaccination of >2000 pregnant women demonstrated no adverse fetal effects associated with influenza vaccine. If a pregnant woman develops influenza, she should be treated with supportive care. Antiviral medications should be reserved for cases where the benefits outweigh the risks. Side effects include sepsis, opportunistic infections, worsening of CHF, chest pain, serum sickness-like reaction, dyspepsia, pruritus, rash, URI, UTI, hypotension, facial or hand edema, and elevated LFTs. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether influenza vaccine crosses the human placenta. Vaccine-stimulated IgG crosses the placenta, perhaps conveying some degree of passive immunity, and it was recently reported that B- and T-cell immune responses occur in the fetus after influenza vaccination. Maternal influenzavaccination reduces respiratory illness rates in their infants byalmost 2=3up to 6m of age. There is no evidence heat-killed vaccine is teratogenic if given in the 1st trimester. Rodentteratogenicity studies have not been performed. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether influenza vaccine enters human breast milk. It is likely the stimulated maternal IgG is excreted into the breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ There are conflicting reports on the effects of influenza vaccine on the elimination of some drugs metabolized by the hepatic CYP system.Hypoprothrombinemia in patients receiving warfarin and elevated serum theophylline concentrations have occurred. Patients with impaired immune responsiveness, whether due toimmunosuppressive therapy (including irradiation, large amountsof corticosteroids, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, and cytotoxic agents), a genetic defect, HIV infection, leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, or other causes, may have a reducedantibody response to active immunization procedures. If feasible, specific serum antibody titers or other immunologic responses may be determined after immunization to assess immunity.Chemoprophylaxis may be indicated for high-risk persons whoare expected to have a poor antibody response to influenza vaccine. Short-term ( <2w) corticosteroid Inactivated vaccines are not a risk toimmunocompromised individuals, although their efficacy may be substantially reduced. #References .........................

Diabetes mellitus\u2014individualized; should when glucose <275mg/dl /C15Contraindications \u2014hypersensitivity to drug or class, hypoglycemia /C15Caution or hepatic dysfunction #Maternal Considerations ..... Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting human insulin analog whose onset is roughly twice as fast as regular human insulin. It issimilar to insulin lispro, which is similar to regular human insulin in controlling postprandial hyperglycemia withoutincreasing the risk of hypoglycemia. Insulin aspart has an added advantage over regular human insulin in that it can be takenimmediately before the meal, rather than 30-60min before.One recent and well-powered RCT concluded that insulin aspart is at least as safe and effective as regular human insulin when used in basal-bolus therapy with neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, and maypotentially offer some benefits in terms of postprandial glucose control and preventing severe hypoglycemia. Careful monitoring of glucose levels coupled with active regulation of the insulindose is crucial for an optimal outcome.Side effects are similar to regular human insulin and include hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, andinjection site reaction. #Fetal Considerations ........... Insulin does not cross the placenta. Hyperglycemia is associated with both an embryopathy and fetopathy. Women with insulin- requiring diabetes prepregnancy are at increased risk of bearing achild with a structural malformation. The magnitude of the risk correlates directly with the overall degree of hyperglycemia. Normalization of glucose prior to conception lowers the riskbelow that of control populations. Euglycemia after theembryonic stage prevents the diabetic fetopathy. While rodent 511teratogenicity studies revealed increased early pregnancy losses, these were likely the product of severe hypoglycemia. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. Itis unknown whether insulin aspart enters human breast milk. Human insulin is a normal component of breast milk.A wide body of clinical experience with similar insulinpreparations suggests it will be compatible with breastfeeding.Lactating women may require dose or meal adjustments or both. #Drug Interactions ................ Many drugs affect glucose metabolism and may necessitate aninsulin dose adjustment. Drugs that can increase thehypoglycemic effect ACEIs, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, octreotide ), and sulfonamide antibiotics.Drugs include corticosteroids, danazol, diuretics, estrogens and b-Blockers, clonidine, lithium, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the hypoglycemic effect of insulin.

Insulin glargine is a long-acting recombinant insulin analog. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The published expereince is confined to case reports and small series. Though the fact that insulin requirements can change dramatically between 16 and 30wgestation, one might intuit the long-acting profile of insulin glargine renders it a poor choice for acute management. However, the case reports suggest it may work well for the basalrelease of insulin between meals. Careful monitoring of glucoselevels coupled with active regulation of the insulin dose is crucial for an optimal outcome. Side effects include hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, and injection site reaction. #Fetal Considerations ...........

Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting human insulin analog with the same potency as regular human insulin. In nonpregnant patients, insulin lispro is superior to regular human insulin for the control of postprandial hyperglycemia without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. Insulin lispro has an added advantage over regular human insulin that it can be taken immediately before the meal, rather than 30-60min before. The published experiencesuggests that similar pregnancy outcomes are obtained with fewer hypoglycemic episodes compared to regular human insulin. Though there are no adequate reports or well-controlled studiesin pregnant women, many state that either this agent or insulin aspart should replace regular human insulin in combination with a long-acting insulin because of a more physiologic releaseprofile. Careful monitoring of glucose levels coupled with activeregulation of the insulin dose is crucial for an optimal outcome. Side effects include hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, and injection site reaction. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Native insulin and insulin lispro, specifcally, do not cross the human placenta.

Native insulin is isolated from the porcine pancreas and modifiedto produce three additional compounds with differing absorptionpatterns.

Human recombinant insulin is synthesized from bacteria containing the human insulin gene. It is then modified to produce three additional compounds with differing absorption patterns. There is alarge body of clinical experience using human recombinant insulin during pregnancy. Careful monitoring of glucose levels coupled withactive regulation of the insulin dose is crucial for an optimaloutcome. An insulin infusion may be desirable at times duringhospitalization. A basal rate can be provided with regular insulin (100U/100ml) infused at a rate 0.55-1.5U/h. Side effects include hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, and injection site reaction. #Fetal Considerations ........... Insulin does not cross the placenta. Hyperglycemia is associatedwith both an embryopathy and fetopathy. Women with 518insulin-requiring diabetes prepregnancy are at increased risk of bearing a child with a structural malformation. The magnitude of the risk correlates directly with the overall degree of hyperglycemia. Normalization of glucose prior to conceptionlowers the risk below control populations. Euglycemia after the embryonic stage prevents the diabetic fetopathy. While rodent teratogenicity studies revealed increased early pregnancy losses,these were likely the product of severe hypoglycemia. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. It is unknown whether human recombinant insulin enters human breast milk. Human insulin is a normal component of breast milk. A wide body of clinical experience with similar insulin preparations suggests it will be compatible with breastfeeding.

There is no evidence that iron supplementation improves pregnancy outcome in the industrialized world. That is not true, however, in developing countries where the treatment of iron deficiency anemia reduces both the antenatal and postnatalmaternal morbidity and mortality. Under these circumstances, iron dextran is more effective than oral treatment in correcting anemia and reducing the need for transfusion. The IM administration of 3 doses (250mg Fe) at monthly intervalsappears effective and well tolerated; it may be used in women who cannot tolerate oral iron. However, IM administration of iron is appropriate only in hospital settings well equipped to treatan anaphylactic crises. Folic acid supplementation isrecommended. Side effects include chest pain, abdominal pain, convulsions, N/V, seizures, headache, hematuria, hypotension, urticaria, respiratory arrest, dyspnea, arthralgia, and arthritis. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of iron dextran in human fetuses. Iron crosses the placenta, but the effect of supplementation on that transport is unclear. There is some evidence that maternal iron dextran IV supplementation increases the fetal iron stores, but it is unclear which form of iron crosses. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Maternal iron supplementation does not alter the concentrationof iron in breast milk, though traces of unmetabolized iron dextran are found in human milk. #Drug Interactions ................

Depression is common during and after pregnancy, but typicallygoes unrecognized. Pregnancy is not a reason a priori to discontinue psychotropic drugs. A major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies a prominent and relatively persistent (almost every day for at least 2w) depressed or dysphoric mood thatinterferes with daily functioning. It includes at least 5 of thefollowing 9 symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increasedfatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking orimpaired concentration, and a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofisocarboxazid in pregnant women. Side effects include hypotension, hepatotoxicity, lower seizure threshold, dry mouth, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and syncope. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether isocarboxazid crosses the human placenta; it does cross the rat placenta. Rodentteratogenicity studies have not been performed. Prolongedtreatment during rodent pregnancy is associated with behavioralchanges. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether isocarboxazid enters human breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Administer with caution to patients receiving disulfiram. In a single study, rats given high intraperitoneal doses of an MAOIplus disulfiram experienced severe toxicity, including convulsions and death.Concomitant use of other psychotropic agents is generally notrecommended because of possible potentiating effects.The MAO inhibitory effects of isocarboxazid may persist for a substantial period after discontinuation. To avoid potentiation,terminate isocarboxazid 10d before beginning the new agent. 536#References be used during pregnancy and lactation only if the benefit justifies the potential perinatal risk. /C15There are alternative agents for which there is more experienceduring pregnancy and lactation.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Isoflurane has been used clinically without pregnancy-related sequelae for many years. Like other halogenatedanesthetic agents, isoflurane produces uterine relaxation. The inhibitory potency of sevoflurane anddesflurane are comparable to, whereas that of isoflurane is smaller than, halothane. Minimum alveolar concentrations causing a 50% inhibition of thecontractile amplitude were 1.7, 1.4, 2.35, and 1.7 (p <.05), respectively. Side effects include malignant hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, arrhythmias, increased relaxation. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Isoflurane rapidly crosses the human placenta, achieving an F:M ratio approximating unity. It has been used for fetal surgery and to facilitate uterine maneuvers. Isoflurane produces moderate fetal hypotension and bradycardia in sheep. However, fetal cerbral oxygenation remains constant despite adecrease in the fetal MAP by 20%. More recently, evidence has emerged that at least in rodents, exposure to such agents leads to neuroapoptosis with permanent brain damage. 537#Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether isoflurane enters human breast milk. However, considering the indications and dosing, one-time isoflurane use is unlikely to pose a clinically significant risk to the breastfeeding neonate. #Drug Interactions ................ Isoflurane all muscle relaxants. Minimum alveolar concentration is by Pathol 2008; 18:198-210. Yoo KY, Lee large clinical experience with isoflurane for general anesthesia during pregnancy.

Isoniazid is metabolized primarily by acetylation and dehydrazination. Approximately half of blacks and Caucasians are ''slow acetylators'' and the rest ''rapid acetylators''; the majority of Eskimos and Orientals are rapid acetylators. The rate ofacetylation does not significantly alter effectiveness, but slowacetylation may lead to higher blood levels and increase toxicity. The risk of isoniazid -induced hepatitis is age-related and 538increased by alcohol ingestion. TB is experiencing a ''rebirth'' in many countries, and untreated TB in pregnancy is a significant threat to mother, fetus, and family. Women with untreated HIV and TB are at particular risk of death. Pregnant women in the USbut born in another country should be screened for TB at the first prenatal visit. There are no adequate reports or well- controlled studies of isoniazid in pregnant women. Adherence to treatment is especially difficult because of a general fear of anymedication and pregnancy-related nausea. All 4 first-line drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, andpyrazinamide have an record in pregnancy. Prophylactic pyridoxine is indicated. Antepartum treatment of latent TB has the greatest likelihood of success secondary to a higher degree of compliance. Side effects include aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, tinnitus, and elevated LFTs. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Isoniazid crosses the human placenta, but has not been associated with an increased risk of malformations. Congenital TB is rare but does occur. Rodent studies arereassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. Embryotoxicity may occur in some rodents. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. Only scant amounts of isoniazid are excreted into human breast milk. It is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding, and is not adequate treatment for neonatal TB. In addition to isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, as well as kanamycin and cycloserine (second-line agents), are considered by the American Academy of Pediatrics to be compatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................

Isotretinoin is contraindicated during pregnancy. Only manufacturer-approved physicians may prescribe it. Thoughmany fail to comply patients must be capable of complying with mandatory contraceptive measures. Patients should be cautionednot to self-medicate with St. John's wort because of a possible interaction with oral contraceptives, increasing the risk of an unplanned pregnancy. It is critical women of childbearing potential select and commit to use 2 forms of effectivecontraception simultaneously, at least 1 of which must be a primary form, unless absolute abstinence is the chosen method, or the patient has undergone a hysterectomy. In one study, acohort of 8609 women between 13 and 45 years of age with afirst prescription for isotretinoin was identified. Pregnancies, spontaneous and elective abortions, and birth defects wereidentified using procedure codes and medical diagnoses. Ninety(90) became pregnant for an annual pregnancy rate of 32.7/1000person-years of treatment. Of these, 76 terminated, 3 had a spontaneous abortion, and 2 had trauma during delivery resulting in neonatal death. There were only 9 live births. Among the livebirths, only one had a congenital anomaly of the face and neck (11%). Adjusting for potential confounders, predictors of becoming pregnant while on isotretinoin were lower socioeconomic level, one or more visits to the doctor or to theemergency department, or one or more hospitalization while on isotretinoin; concomitant isotretinoin and oral contraceptive use had a preventive effect. Side effects include major birth defects, depression, psychosis, suicidal ideation, hepatotoxicity, pseudotumor arthralgia, peeling of the palms,decreased tinnitus, and nail bed changes. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Isotretinoin and its active metabolites crosses the human (and subhuman primate) placenta, and it is a knownhuman teratogen. Multiple organ systems are affected, including CNS, CV, and endocrine organs. Mental retardation without external malformation has also been reported. Similarmalformations occur in rodents. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknownwhether isotretinoin enters human breast milk. Considering its effect on the fetus, breastfeeding is considered contraindicated. #Drug Interactions ................ Patients should be advised against taking vitamin supplementscontaining vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects.Combined use with tetracyclines may increase the risk of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension). 545Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between systemic corticosteroids andisotretinoin. Associated with depression in some patients.

Side effects include hepatic toxicity CHF, pulmonary somnolence, and albuminuria. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Itraconazole interacts with a major placental transporter, P-glycoprotein. In one prospective cohort study,there was no evidence of teratogenicity or fetal sequelae. Inrodents, doses of itraconazole 5-20/C2the MRHD were associated with maternal and embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in the survivors, consisting predominantly of skeletal defects. In another rodent study, skeletal defects occurred after early exposure(day 8), while cleft lip and palate were seen following laterexposure (day 13). #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. Itraconazole enters human breast milk, but the pharmacokinetics are presently unclear. According to the manufacturer, the maximum M:P ratio is 1.77, the milk concentration is 70mcg/L, and a theoretic infantdose is 10mcg/kg/d. #Drug Interactions ................ Numerous drug interactions are described, and the following ismeant only as an illustrative summary.Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxyitraconazole, are inhibitors of CYP3A4. As such, it can decrease the elimination of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, and as a result increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Such drugs CYP3A4 may increase the plasma concentrations of itraconazole. These drugs include 548clarithromycin, erythromycin, indinavir, andritonavir. Patients who must take itraconazole with one of these drugs should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of itraconazole. Whenever possible, plasma concentrations should be monitored, and dosage adjustments made after itraconazole therapy is initiated. Inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the plasma concentrations of itraconazole and thus block efficacy. These drugs Med 2001; 40:1128-31.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It is popular in some locales for cesarean delivery of parturientswho are either hemorrhaging or have asthma (increased catecholamine release ameliorates bronchospasm) or fetal acidemia. Compared to thiopental, women who receive ketamine during cesarean delivery have a lower need for supplementalanalgesia postoperatively. The incidence of awareness to verbal commands during surgery is lower with ketamine compared to thiopental, but the frequency of recall of intraoperative events is not different. There is reportedly an increased incidence of dreaming during anesthesia, which may lead to dissatisfaction with the anesthetic experience. Ketamine has also been used with neuraxial anesthesia. In women undergoing cesarean section with spinal analgesia, the addition of ketamine (0.05mg/kg) intrathecally to 10mg of spinal plain bupivacaine (0.5%) led to rapid onset of both sensory and motor blockade and enhancedthe segmental spread of spinal block without prolonging theduration of analgesia, while fentanyl provided prolonged analgesia. In other studies, IV low-dose ketamine combined with intrathecal bupivacaine was reported to provide longer analgesia after cesarean section and lower postoperative analgesicconsumption than bupivacaine alone, suggesting a preemptive effect.Side effects include increased ICP, laryngospasm, increased intraocular and hallucinations. 552#Fetal Considerations ...........

Ketoconazole is a known aromatase inhibitor and may alter sex hormone levels. Although the drug is absorbed when applied topically, the systemic concentration is relatively low. Ketoconazole has been used to treat Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy.Side effects include hepatic failure or LFTs, and rash. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Ketoconazole is a P-glycoprotein substrate, though placental transfer has not apparently been studied. Several studies suggest ketoconazole interferes with ovarian synthesis of progesterone by inhibiting aromatase. As such, it could interfere with implantation and maintenance of early pregnancy. However,limited epidemiological studies are reassuring. Ketoconazole produced maternal toxicity along with syndactyly andoligodactyly in rodents exposed to 10 /C2the MRHD. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Only a trace amount of maternally administered ketoconazole enters human breast milk, and it is generally considered safeduring breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ A potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Use with drugs primarilymetabolized by CYP3A4 may increase the plasma concentrationsof such drugs and increase or prolong both therapeutic andadverse effects. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, appropriate dosage adjustments may be necessary. Use with terfenadine can increase plasma concentration. Use with astemizole may result in elevated plasma levels of astemizole and its active metabolite desmethylastemizole, which may prolong QT intervals. Use with astemizole is therefore contraindicated.Use with cisapride produces a mean 8-fold increase in the AUC ofcisapride, which can cause prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG. Therefore, use with cisapride is contraindicated. May increase plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, andmethylprednisolone to a degree requiring dosage adjustment. Can increase the concentrations of midazolam andtriazolam. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, so thesedrugs should not be used in women treated with ketoconazole. Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to thecombination of therapy. Therefore, it is advisable to monitordigoxin concentrations closely. May enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs; theanticoagulant effect should be carefully monitored and adjustedas needed.Severe hypoglycemia has been reported in patients receiving miconazole (an imidazole) and oral hypoglycemic agents; such a 554potential interaction involving use with ketoconazole (an imidazole) cannot be ruled out. Use with phenytoin may alter the metabolism of one or both of the drugs; monitor serum levels closely. Use with rifampin reduces the blood levels of rifampin. Isoniazid is also reported to affect ketoconazole concentrations adversely. These drugs should not be given concomitantly.Rare cases of a disulfiram -like reaction to alcohol have been reported. These experiences have been characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea, and headache. Symptoms resolved within a few hours. #References .........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoprofen provides effective analgesia after both vaginal and cesarean delivery, but its efficacy is similar toother NSAIDs such as diclofenac. Side effects include renal failure, fluid retention, dyspepsia, GI bleeding, bronchospasm, interstitial nephritis, hepatotoxicity,Stevens-Johnson syndrome, headache, nausea, LFTs,thrombocytopenia, tinnitus, and drowsiness. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Ketoprofen rapidly crosses the placenta, reaching an F:M ratio approaching unity. Most other NSAIDs can produce fetal oliguria and ductal constriction in a dose- and gestational age-dependent fashion. One case report suggests ketoprofen has the same actions. Another study suggests the active S isomer is preferentially transported across the term placenta. Further, acute renal failure is reported in preterm infants whose mothersreceived ketoprofen prior to delivery. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Low concentrations of ketoprofen are found in human breast milk, but the breastfed infant would consume less than 1% of thematernal weight adjusted dose. #Drug Interactions ................ NSAIDs may decrease the antihypertensive effect of ACEIs.NSAIDs can reduce the natriuetic effect of furosemide and thiazides. When given concomitantly with ketoprofen, hydrochlorothiazide reduces urinary potassium and chloride excretion compared to hydrochlorothiazide alone. Patients taking diuretics are at a greater risk of developing renal failure secondary to a decrease in renal blood flow caused by NSAIDs.NSAIDs can reduce the renal clearance and increase the serumlevels of lithium. Thus, patients receiving both drugs should be observed closely for signs of lithium toxicity. NSAIDs are reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate clearance and may increase the risk of toxicity.Probenecid increases both free and bound ketoprofen by reducing the plasma clearance of ketoprofen to about 1=3, as well as decreasing its protein binding. This combination is not recommended.The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk ofserious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.Concurrent therapy with ketoprofen and warfarin requires close monitoring of patients. #References ......................... agent for puerperal analgesia.

Ketorolac is indicated for the management of pain that usually would require an opioid for relief. There are no adequate reportsor well-controlled studies in pregnant women.Side effects include renal failure, fluid retention, dyspepsia, GI bleeding, bronchospasm, interstitial nephritis, hepatotoxicity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, LFTs, tinnitus, and drowsiness. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether ketorolac crosses the placenta. Most other NSAIDs can produce fetal oliguria and ductal constriction in a dose- and gestational age-dependent fashion. It is not known whether ketorolac has the same actions. 557Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR. The perinatal mortality rate in rodents was increased in association with delayed onset of parturition. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Small quantities of ketorolac enter human breast milk. An unsupplemented newborn would ingest <0.4% of the daily maternal dose. #Drug Interactions ................ Reduces the diuretic response to furosemide in normovolemic healthy subjects by approximately 20%. Administration with probenecid resulted in decreased clearance ofketorolac and significant increases in ketorolac plasma levels (total AUC increased approximately 3-fold from 5.4 to 17.8mcg/ h/ml). Therefore, concomitant use with probenecid is contraindicated. NSAIDs can reduce renal lithium clearance. Some NSAIDs may reduce the clearance of methotrexate. Concomitant use of ACEIs may increase the risk of renalimpairment, particularly in volume-depleted patients.Hallucinations have been reported when used in patients excellent analgesic, but there are other NSAIDs for which there is more experience regarding use duringpregnancy Canada, Chile, Czech Republic,Denmark, England, France, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, Venezuela) #Drug Class .......................... diastolic BP >105mmHg, administer incremental dosing of 5-10mg IV, with a cumulative dose of40-80mg IV over 20 min; max 300mg IV /C15Contraindications \u2014hypersensitivity to drug or class, diabetes mellitus, or cocaine, abrupt withdrawal, major surgery #Maternal Considerations ..... Hypertensive disorders complicate 5-10% of pregnancies and area leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and death.Severe hypertension (systolic BP >170mmHg and/or diastolic BP >110mmHg) should be treated rapidly to reduce the risk of stroke, death, and possibly eclampsia in preeclamptic women.There is no consensus whether mild to moderate hypertensionshould be treated during pregnancy. The risks of transient severe hypertension, the likelihood of antenatal hospitalization, proteinuria at delivery, and neonatal RDS may be decreased bytherapy. Labetalol reduces BP more slowly than nifedipine, and it does not increase the maternal cardiac index as nifedipine does. Thus, labetalol is the drug of choice for hypertensive women with tachycardia. Labetalol has a lower risk of hypotension than parenteral hydralazine. Labetalol is better tolerated than methyldopa and provides more efficient BP control. It reduces cerebral pressure without altering cerebralperfusion. IV labetalol is equally effective as IV hydralazine for the treatment of postpartum hypertension. Labetalol may also be useful for the treatment of maternal thyrotoxicosis during labor.Side effects include hepatic necrosis, the human placenta, yielding an F:M ratio of 0.5 and an AF:M norhydralazine vasodilates the perfused human cotyledon. Doppler flow studies reveal no change in umbilical, uterine, and middle cerebralresistances after treatment. IV labetalol can cause fetal bradycardia. The available data are inadequate to determine whether labetalol adversely affects fetal or neonatal HR and pattern. Until such data are available, FHR changes should not be attributed to a drug effect, but rather to progression of theunderlying maternal or placental disease. Hypoglycemia, bradycardia, hypotension, pericardial myocardial 559hypertrophy are reported after long-term oral labetalol. Fetal death may also occur after a sudden drop in the maternal BP, the risk of which can be minimized by adequate hydration. Overall, neonatal outcome is similar to that achieved withhydralazine. Labetalol may be useful for the treatment of fetal thyrotoxicosis. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing noevidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doseshigher than those used clinically. Labetalol reduces uteroplacental blood flow selectively in guinea pigs, perhaps explaining the increased frequency of IUGR in this model. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no consistent relation between maternal plasma and milk concentrations either within or between individuals. The risk of hypoglycemia in breastfed neonates is increased by labetalol but may be blunted with glucose-fortified formula. #Drug Interactions ................ May increase the risk of tremor when taken with TCAs.May blunt the bronchodilator effect of b-agonists; therefore, greater than normal doses of a b-agonist may be required for the treatment of asthma.Cimetidine increases the bioavailability of labetalol. Special care should be used in establishing the dose required for BP control in such patients.Synergism with halothane has been shown. High concentrations (>3%) should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased and because of the possibilities of a large reductionin cardiac output and an increase in the central venous pressure.The anesthesiologist should be informed when a patient is receiving labetalol. Blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effect. Additional antihypertensiveeffects may occur. Care should be taken if labetalol is used concomitantly with calcium antagonists of the verapamil type. Patients with a history of anaphylaxis to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive tothe usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction. #References .........................

Lactulose helps restore normal bowel habits. It is poorly absorbed, and women with lactose intolerance tolerate lactulose better in the 3rd trimester because of slow transit and bacterial adaptation. It is 561used by some to maintain a soft stool after delivery complicated by rectal extension. Side effects include acidosis, abdominal distention, belching, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, N/V, electrolyte disorders, hypernatremia, and flatulence. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies oflactulose in human fetuses. Because of poor maternal absorption, it is unlikely the maternal systemic concentration will reach a clinically relevant level. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doseshigher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether lactulose enters human breast milk. Because of poor maternal absorption, it is unlikely the maternal systemicconcentration will reach a clinically relevant level. Breastfeeding infants require lactase to metabolize lactose, the major carbohydrate in breast milk. Lactase is located on the smallintestinal brush border and is extremely vulnerable to pathogenic damage. #Drug Interactions ................ There are conflicting reports about use with neomycin. Theoretically, the elimination of certain colonic bacteria byneomycin and possibly other anti-infective agents may interfere with the desired breakdown of lactulose and thus prevent the acidification of colonic contents. Use with nonabsorbable antacids may inhibit the desired lactulose-induced drop in colonic pH. Other laxatives should not be used, especially during the initialphase of therapy for portal-systemic encephalopathy, because the loose stools resulting from their use may falsely suggest that adequate lactulose dosage has been achieved. #References .........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of lamivudine in pregnant women. Lamivudine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching maximal serum after 30-90min. Triple therapy ( zidovudine, lamivudine, nevirapine ) is a highly effective regimen. However, there are reports of rapid development of genotypic resistance tolamivudine. HIV therapy that reduces the viral load significantly reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission. Hepatotoxicity,usually within 5mo of beginning therapy, is a major concern during pregnancy. It is most severe when associated with HBV and HCV co-infection. There are presently only 2 drugs for thetreatment of hepatitis B during pregnancy\u2014 interferon alfa-2b andlamivudine. The initial response to lamivudine is superior tointerferon alfa-2b. Lamivudine is reportedly safe in pregnant women with chronic HBV infection during the last weeks ofpregnancy. However, reduced HBV particle number does not necessarily translate into decreased vertical transmission. Further, resistant HBV strains develop in some patients. US federalgovernment guidelines recommend zidovudine plus lamivudine for health care personnel exposed to both HBV and HIV. Side effects include hepatitis B. #Fetal Considerations ........... The worldwide spread of HIV-1 has resulted in an estimated 1million children born yearly to HIV-1-infected mothers. In theabsence of antiretroviral intervention, about 25% are HIV-1 infected. Maternal AZT prophylaxis reduces the rate of neonatal transmission to some 7%, with further reductions with combination therapy including lamivudine. Lamivudine readily crosses the human placenta; the AF:M ratio reportedly varies from unity to 4. This level does not necessarily prevent HBV transmission to the perinate despite undetectable maternal viralDNA. Large trials are awaited. Relative and absolute polymerasechain reaction quantification reveals a 3- to 4-fold mean increase in MDR1 placental transcription in HIV-infected women. Further, there is a 2.5-fold increase of immunoreactiveP-glycoprotein in placentas from HIV-infected women. ThisMDR1 overexpression is observed regardless of antiretroviral therapy. This suggests that P-glycoprotein in placentas from 563HIV-infected women would modulate the maternofetal transport of antiretrovirals across the placental barrier and consequently decrease fetal exposure to these compounds. Neonatal prophylaxis with both zidovudine andlamivudine is typically initiated within 12h of birth. Mitochondrial disorders are described in children exposed in utero to some reverse transcriptase enzyme inhibitors (e.g., zidovudine ). While rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically, embryotoxicity occurs in rabbits. In monkeys, lamivudine becomes incorporated into the DNA of multiple fetal organs and telomere shortening occurs. In human infants, lamivudine incorporation as well as HPRT and glycophorin A assay (GPA) mutagenesis have been documented in cord blood from infants exposed in utero tozidovudine andlamivudine. Given the risk:benefit ratio, these highly successful drugs will continue to beused for prevention of vertical viral transmission; however, evidence of genotoxicity suggests exposed children should be followed well past adolescence for early detection of potentialcancer hazard. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Lamivudine is excreted into human breast milk, though the kinetics remain to be elucidated. Breastfeeding is contraindicated in HIV-infected nursing women where formula is available to reduce the risk of neonatal transmission. However, inwomen receiving zidovudine, 1mo postpartum, median M:P ratios were 1.1, 0.6, and 1.8, respectively. HIV RNA levels in breast milk were significantly lower than in untreated women(median of 2.3 vs. 3.4 log at delivery and 1.9 vs. 3.6 log at day 7; p<.001 for both comparisons). Almost 90% of treated women have less than 50 copies/ml compared to only 1=3of untreated women. DNA loads are unaffected. Thus, antiretroviral agents administered during the 3rd trimester and after delivery reach levels similar to or higher than plasma concentrations in breast milk and can significantly reduce HIV RNA levels, and supportthe potential role of maternal HAART prophylaxis in reducingthe risk of breastfeeding-associated transmission. Further, HIV-1 inhibitory concentrations of nevirapine are achieved in breastfeeding infants, exposing infants to the potential beneficial and adverse effects of nevirapine. #Drug Interactions ................

Most pregnancies are uneventful in women with epilepsy, and most babies are delivered healthy with no increased risk of obstetric complications in women. There are no adequate reports 565or well-controlled studies of lamotrigine during pregnancy. Concerns over teratogenicity of AEDs must be weighed against the risks to the mother and fetus of seizures. Therapeutic drug monitoring has therefore been recommended to control forchanges in the disposition of the older generation AEDs during pregnancy. Much less is known about gestation-induced alterations in the pharmacokinetics of the AEDs that have been introduced inthe last 15y. Lamotrigine is by far the most extensively studied ofthe newer AEDs. Lamotrigine clearance is increased during pregnancy, and many women require a higher dose to maintaintherapeutic levels. Pronounced alterations have been reported, withan increase of >300% from baseline in late pregnancy in some patients on monotherapy. The available data suggest the associated decline in plasma concentrations is associated with loss of seizure control. Limited data indicate a similar decline in late pregnancy inplasma concentrations of the active monohydroxy derivative ofoxcarbazepine. Adjustments are based on clinical symptoms, not solely on serum drug levels. Lamotrigine is an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase. Adequate folate supplementationbeginning preconception is wise. The impact of pregnancy on clearance reverses quickly postpartum. The most frequent adverse maternal effect is skin rash, typically in the first month oftreatment. Planned pregnancy and counseling before conception iscrucial. Counseling should cover folate supplementation, the importance medication compliance, the risk of teratogenicity, and the importance of prenatal care. Lamotrigine increases the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and progestogens; a preparation containing at least 50mcg of ethinyl estradiol is recommended. Side effects include rash life-threatening), vision, N/V, dyspepsia, anxiety, insomnia, pain, weight decrease, chest pain, infection, aplastic hemolytic There no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Lamotrigine crosses the human placenta, achieving an F:M ratio near unity. Women taking anticonvulsantmedication of any type have a 4-8% risk of delivering a child with a birth defect compared to 2-4% in the general population. Lamotrigine inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme necessary for the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR at doses analogous to human. The highestdoses cause maternal and fetal toxicity characterized by IUGRand ventricular dilation. Though some data are conflicting, registry data do not reveal a significant increase in the risk of major malformation (2.8% for 1st trimester exposure withmonotherapy, but 4.3% with polytherapy). Use of monotherapyat the lowest effective quantity given in divided doses to minimize the peaks can minimize the risks. Recent pregnancy databases suggest valproate is significantly more teratogenic than carbamazepine, and the combination of valproate and lamotrigine is particularly teratogenic. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... The median M:P ratio ranges from 0.5 to 0.8 2-3w postpartum,and nursed infants maintain plasma concentrations approximating 30% of the mother's plasma level. While no adverse effects have been reported, the infant should bemonitored closely if the mother elects to breastfeed, the druggiven at the lowest effective dose, and breastfeeding avoided at times of peak drug levels. 566#Drug Interactions ................ Limited clinical data suggest there is a higher incidence of dizziness, diplopia, ataxia, and blurred vision in patients receiving carbamazepine with lamotrigine than in patients receiving other AEDs with lamotrigine. Limited clinical data suggest a higher incidence of headache,dizziness, nausea, and somnolence with co-administration of lamotrigine andoxcarbazepine compared to lamotrigine alone alone. The addition of valproate may increase lamotrigine steady-state concentrations by slightly more than 2-fold.The addition carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, orprimidone 40%. The AUC and C maxoflamotrigine were reduced on average by 24% and 20%, respectively, following the addition of olanzapine (15mg qd) to lamotrigine (200mg qd) in healthy male volunteers (n = 16) compared to healthy male volunteers receivinglamotrigine alone (n = 12). This reduction in lamotrigine concentration is not expected to be clinically relevant. In a study in 10 male volunteers, rifampin (600mg/d for 5d) increased the apparent clearance of a single 25mg dose oflamotrigine by 2-fold (AUC Prescribers should beaware of this action when prescribing other medications that inhibit folate metabolism. In a study of an oral contraceptive preparation containing 30mcgethinyl estradiol and 150mcg levonorgestrel, the apparent clearance of lamotrigine (300mg/d) increased some 2-fold with a mean decrease in AUC of 52% and in C maxof 39%. Trough serum lamotrigine concentrations gradually increased and were 2-fold higher at the end of the week of the inactive preparation. Gradual but transient increases in lamotrigine levels will occur during the week of no active hormone preparation (pill-free week) for women not also taking a drug that increases theclearance of lamotrigine (e.g., increase in lamotrigine levels will be greater if the dose of lamotrigine is increased in the few days before or during the pill-free week. Dosage adjustmentsmay be necessary for women receiving oral contraceptive preparations. Did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the ethinyl estradiol component of an oral contraceptive preparation containing 30mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150mcg levonorgestrel. However, there was a decrease in the AUC and C maxof the levonorgestrel component of 19% respectively. Measurement of serum FSH, LH, and estradiol indicated that there was some loss of suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. The effects of doses of lamotrigine other than 300mg/d have not been studied. The possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy insome patients cannot be excluded, and women should be instructed to promptly report changes in their menstrual pattern (e.g., breakthrough bleeding). #References .........................

GERD and/or heartburn occur in 45-85% of women during pregnancy. The effect of estrogen and progesterone on lower esophageal sphincter tone is a recognized factor. The treatment of GERD consists of reducing gastric acidity following a step-up algorithm beginning with lifestyle modifications and dietary changes. Antacids or sucralfate are first-line medical therapy, 568followed by histamine receptor antagonists. Ranitidine is probably preferred because of its documented efficacy and safety profile in pregnancy, even in the 1st trimester. Proton pump inhibitors are reserved for the woman with intractable symptomsor complicated reflux disease. However, proton pump inhibitors such as lansoprazole are generally considered effective treatment for GERD in pregnant women, and the findings of a recent prospective multicenter trial are reassuring. Adverse effects havenot been reported. Further, proton pump inhibitors are first-line agents for the prevention of ''aspiration syndrome'' during general anesthesia. Lansoprazole has also been used with apparent success to treat a woman with Zollinger Ellisonsyndrome during pregnancy. Side effects include hepatic failure, Johnson #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It isunknown whether lansoprazole crosses the human placenta. Epidemiologic and post-marketing surveillance studies arereassuring. Rodent studies too are reassuring, revealing noevidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doseshigher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether lansoprazole enters human breast milk. It is excreted into rodent milk. #Drug Interactions ................ a minor increase (10%) in theophylline clearance occurs. Thus, some women may require titration of their theophylline dosage when lansoprazole is started or stopped. There have been reports of increased INR and PT in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors such as lansoprazole with warfarin. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly may need to be monitored more closely. In a single-dose crossover study examining lansoprazole 30mg andomeprazole 20mg each administered and concomitantly with sucralfate 1g, absorption of the proton pump inhibitors was delayed and their bioavailability was reduced by17% and 16%, respectively. Therefore, proton pump inhibitors should be taken at least 30min prior to sucralfate. May interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is animportant determinant S, et al.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Leflunomide likely crosses the human placenta. No pattern of malformations has been reported in infantsexposed to leflunomide, but the number of reported pregnancy outcomes is small. In an ongoing prospective controlled study ofrheumatoid arthritis (RA) medications in pregnancy beingconducted by OTIS, 43 leflunomide -exposed women were compared to 78 women with RA who did not use leflunomide and with a second group of 47 women without RA. Preliminarydata indicate rates of major birth defects were similar in all 3groups. Infants exposed to leflunomide were significantly more likely than infants of women without RA to be born prematurelyand to be smaller. There were, however, no significant differencesin these 2 measures between leflunomide -exposed infants and nonexposed infants of women with RA, suggesting that the underlying disease or other medications used to treat RA are likely associated with these adverse outcomes. The incidences ofanophthalmia and micropthalmia are increased in rats treatedwith only 0.1 /C2the concentration recommended in humans. In rabbits, a dose analogous to the human is associated withembryotoxicity and bony abnormalities. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether leflunomide enters human breast milk. In light of the animal studies, it is best to avoid breastfeeding ifleflunomide must be prescribed. 571#Drug Interactions ................ Cholestyramine oractivated charcoal produce a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of leflunomide ). The prevalence of side effects increases when leflunomide is given with hepatotoxic substances. This is also a risk when leflunomide is followed by such drugs. In one small study with methotrexate,1=3of patients experienced a 2-fold or greater increase in hepatic enzymes. All elevations resolved, 4 despite continuation of both drugs and 6after discontinuation of leflunomide. Three patients met ''ACR criteria'' for liver biopsy (1: Roegnik Grade I, 2: Roegnik GradeIIIa). No pharmacokinetic interaction was identified.M1 was shown in in vitro studies to cause increases ranging from 13% to 50% in the free fraction of diclofenac andibuprofen at concentrations in the clinical range. While the clinical significanceof this finding is unknown, there was extensive use of NSAIDs inclinical studies and no differential effect was observed.M1 was shown in in vitro studies to increase the free fraction of tolbutamide 13-50% at concentrations in the clinical range. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.M1 peak levels were increased ( /C2440%) after concomitant administration of a single dose of leflunomide to subjects receiving multiple doses of rifampin. Because of the potential for leflunomide levels to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both leflunomide andrifampin.

Gestational trophoblastic disease is a spectrum of disorders ranging from the benign complete or partial hydatidiform mole to malignant choriocarcinoma. While the preponderance ofwomen are cured by surgery, the occasional patient requires chemotherapy. Methotrexate, an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, is the first-line agent. It can persist in human tissue for long periods. Leucovorin is a derivative of tetrahydrofolate and as such circumvents the block. Supplementation minimizes toxicity and can counteract inadvertent overdose. Methotrexate may be given as a single dose IM, which usually does not require leucovorin, or in a multiple-dose regimen, which does require leucovorin rescue.

However, under certain circumstances (e.g., as prophylaxis after MI), there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of b-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, cardioselective b-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution. The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that can result from non-potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide) can be acutely worsened by b-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the b-agonist is exceeded. Digoxin levels decrease 16% and 22% after single doses of racemic albuterol to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days. Thus, it is prudent to carefully evaluate the digoxin levels in patients who are currently receiving digoxin andlevalbuterol.

Levetiracetam is unrelated to other AEDs, and is used for the treatment for partial-onset seizures. Case series suggest it is well- tolerated during pregnancy. Maternal clearance increases such that 3rd trimester levels are only 40%-50% of baseline absent a dose adjustment. Those women who become or who are planningto become pregnant while taking levetiracetam should supplement their folic acid intake. Once pregnant, dosage 579readjustments may be necessary and should be based on clinical symptoms, and not exclusively on serum drug concentrations. A specific drug registry for women exposed to levetiracetam during pregnancy has been established by the manufacturer (1-888-537-7734). Side effects include N/V, suicide attempts, psychosis, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, somnolence, asthenia, cough,rhinitis, and diplopia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. In one series of 11 exposed pregnancies, therewere 3 neonates with IUGR. Levetiracetam crosses the human placenta, an F:M ratio of 0.56-2.0. In vitro, carbamazepine andtopiramate alone did not induce neuronal death; both drugs exacerbate phenytoin -induced cell death. In contrast, co-treatment with levetiracetam andcarbamazepine did not enhance cell death in the developing brain. Thus, it may bepossible to avoid proapoptotic effects, even in polytherapy, bychoosing appropriate drugs. Levetiracetam, as monotherapy or in combination, may be a promising candidate for the treatment ofwomen during pregnancy and for preterm and neonatal infants.Rodent studies conducted using doses in excess of the MRHDreveal embryotoxicity and an increased prevalence of skeletal malformations. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Levetiracetam enters human breast milk. In two small studies of 11 women, the mean M:P ratio approximated 1.

Levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of mild, moderate, and severe infections caused by a wide variety of susceptiblemicroorganisms. There are no adequate reports or well-controlledstudies of levofloxacin in pregnant women. Compared to other quinolones, levofloxacin has fewer adverse GI or CNS events and is minimally phototoxic. Levofloxacin should not be used for the treatment of gonorrhea because of the growing prevalence of resistant strains. Recent studies report increased sensitivity of Chlamydia trachomatis to quinolone medication. Vaginal candidiasis is more frequently associated with quinolone use thanwith other 583Side effects include tendonitis, restlessness, light-headedness, anxiety, agitation, confusion, elevated LFTs, dyspepsia, and taste perversion. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Less than 4% of maternal levofloxacin and ofloxacin crosses the isolated perfused human placenta. Intracompartmental clearance has not been detailed to date. Animal studies (mice, dogs, rabbits) reveal that several quinolones are associated with a juvenile arthropathy, and it is this toxicitythat has lead to their restricted use in pregnant women. However,not all quinolones have the same potency on cartilage growth. Further, the use of quinolones during the 1st trimester of human pregnancy has not been associated with an increased risk ofmalformations or musculoskeletal conditions. Rodent studies withlevofloxacin are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity despite the use of doses higher than those usedclinically. IUGR was noted. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... At steady state, peak levofloxacin exposure in breast milk approximates 8mcg/ml 5h after dosing. Eliminationpharmacokinetics followed the anticipated pattern. Thus, peaklevofloxacin concentrations in human breast milk are similar to levels attained in plasma. However, breastfeeding mothers whotake levofloxacin will expose their infants to levofloxacin in concentrations below those being studied in the pediatricpopulation. #Drug Interactions ................ Antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, as well assucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc, may reduce GI absorption, resulting insystemic levels considerably lower than desired. These agentsshould be taken at least 2h before or 2h after levofloxacin. Administration of other quinolones with theophylline has resulted in a prolonged elimination t/2, elevated serumtheophylline levels, and a subsequent increase in the risk of theophylline -related adverse reactions in the patient population. Prolongation of the PT in the setting of concurrent warfarin and levofloxacin use have been associated with bleeding. PT, INR, or other suitable anticoagulation tests should be closely monitored iflevofloxacin is used with warfarin. Quinolones may cause an increase in the serum levels ofcyclosporine. No dosage adjustment is required. Use of NSAIDs with a quinolone, including levofloxacin, may increase the risk of CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures. Both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia are reported in patients treated with both quinolones and an antidiabetic agent.

The diagnosis of hypothyroidism (and hyperthyroidism) should be always confirmed by laboratory tests and not by symptoms. Levothyroxine is the standard for the treatment of hypothyroidism during pregnancy. Women withisolated hypothyroxinemia are neither at increased risk for adverse perinatal outcome nor have an increased prevalence of thyroid peroxidase antibodies; it may well be biologicallyinsignificant. In contrast, up to 1=3of women with asymptomatic hypothyroidism diagnosed because of an elevated TSH have thyroid peroxidise antibodies. It has been suggested that asymptomatic maternal hypothyroidism is associated with anincreased prevalence of neurodevelopmental but isunknown whether these 586women alters that risk. Asymptomatic hypothyroidism is more common in multiple gestation. Be aware that the TSH of women chronically hyper- or hypothyroid may respond much more slowly to replacement than the free T 4level. Side effects include weight loss, increased appetite, palpitations, nervousness, diarrhea, arrhythmias, CHF, hypertension, angina,abdominal cramps, sweating, tachycardia, tremors, insomnia, heatintolerance, fever, menstrual irregularities, and alopecia. #Fetal Considerations ........... Thyroid hormones are essential for normal brain development.Both maternal and fetal thyroid hormones contribute. Thoughmaternal thyroid hormone transport across the placenta is low, itsimportance is illustrated by the fact that most athyrotic newborns have no sign of hypothyroidism, and the degree of maternal hypothyroidism early and midgestation correlates with theseverity of fetal neural damage. The children of women withsubclinical hypothyroidism in the first half of pregnancy have lower mean Mental Developmental Index scores during the 1st year of life. Fetal hypothyroidism can be diagnosed bycordocentesis. Hypothyroid fetuses are treated by weekly intra- amniotic injections of levothyroxine. The adequacy of therapy is determined by periodic measurement of free T 4, free T 3, and TSH compared to gestational age-appropriate norms. Most fetuses whose mothers are being treated with propylthiouracil are not euthyroid and should be monitored directly. Ultrasonographicevaluation of the fetus by biparietal diameter, cranial andabdominal circumference, and both humerus and femur length isrecommended. Craniosynostosis is associated with iatrogenic hyperthyroidism in infants receiving thyroid hormone replacement therapy. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Levothyroxine is excreted at low concentrations into human breast milk. The neonatal effect is controversial.Some reports suggest that the levels in breast milk are sufficient to treat neonatal hypothyroidism. It is unknown whether maternal supplementation exchange resins (e.g., kayexalate ),ferrous sulfate, sucralfate, and soybean flour (e.g., infant formula) each may reduce the efficacy of levothyroxine by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Calcium carbonate mayform an insoluble chelate with levothyroxine, and ferrous sulfate likely forms a ferric-thyroxine complex. Administer levothyroxine at least 4h apart from these and Aminoglutethimide, para-aminosalicylic acid, levels, by affecting either thyroidhormone synthesis, secretion, distribution, metabolism, action, or elimination, or altering TSH secretion. Metabolic clearance of adrenocorticoids is decreased inhypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients, andmay therefore change with changing thyroid status. Amiodarone can cause hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Oral cholecystographic agents and amiodarone are slowly excreted, producing more prolonged hypothyroidism than parenterally Amiodarone and contrastagents) may cause hyperthyroidism in euthyroid patients withGraves' disease previously treated with antithyroid drugs or ineuthyroid patients with thyroid autonomy (e.g., multinodular goiter or hyperfunctioning thyroid adenoma). Hyperthyroidism may develop over several weeks and may persist for severalmonths after therapy discontinuation. Amiodarone may induce hyperthyroidism by causing thyroiditis.Long-term lithium therapy can result in goiter in up to 50% of patients, and either subclinical or overt hypothyroidism, each inup to 20% of patients. The fetus, neonate, elderly, and euthyroid patients with underlying thyroid disease (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis orGraves' disease previously treated with radioiodine or surgery) areamong those individuals who are particularly susceptible to iodine-induced hypothyroidism. The hypoprothrombinemic effect of anticoagulants may bepotentiated, apparently by increased catabolism of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Concomitant use of these agents impairs the compensatory increases in clotting factor synthesis.The PT should be carefully monitored in patients takinglevothyroxine and oral anticoagulants and the dose of anticoagulant therapy adjusted accordingly.Hypoglycemic agent requirements may be reduced in hypothyroidpatients with diabetes mellitus and may increase with theinitiation of thyroid hormone replacement. Actions of some of b-blocking agents may be impaired when hypothyroid patients become euthyroid. Serum digitalis levels may be decreased in hyperthyroidism or when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid. Marked hypertension and tachycardia have been reported inassociation with concomitant use of levothyroxine andketamine. Maprotiline may increase the risk iodide may accelerate epiphyseal closure. Untreated hypothyroidism may interfere with the growth response to somatrem or somatropin. Theophylline clearance may be decreased in hypothyroid patientsand return toward normal when a euthyroid state is achieved.Concurrent use of TCAs may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased catecholamine sensitivity. Toxic effects may include increased risk of arrhythmiasand CNS stimulation; onset of action of tricyclics may be accelerated. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on levothyroxine may result in increased levothyroxine requirements. There is a possible increased risk of coronary insufficiency in patients with each may cause protein-binding site displacement, resulting in an initial transient increase in free T 4. Continued administration results in a decrease in serum T 4and normal free T 4and TSH concentrations and, therefore, patients are clinically euthyroid.Salicylates inhibit binding of T 4and T 3to thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) and transthyretin. An initial increase in serumfree T 4is followed by return of free T 4to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, althoughtotal T 4levels may decrease by degradation levothyroxine, resulting in increased levothyroxine requirements. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of levothyroxine, and total and free T 4may be reduced by 20-40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically glucocorticoids (e.g., dexamethasone 4mg/d), may decrease the peripheral conversion of T 4to T3, leading to decreased T 3levels. However, serum T 4levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160mg/d), T3and T 4levels change slightly, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T 3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T 4levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightlydecreased T 3and T 4levels due to decreased TBG production. Interferon-alfa has been associated with the development ofantithyroid microsomal antibodies in 20% of patients, and somehave transient hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or both. Patientswho have antithyroid antibodies before treatment are at higher risk for thyroid dysfunction during treatment. IL-2 has been associated with transient painless thyroiditis in 20% of patients. #References .........................

Lidocaine has been used for decades for paracervical/pudendal blocks and perineal infiltration prior to episiotomy. Buffered products reduce the pain of infiltration. However, sprayedlidocaine is not effective for perineal anesthesia. Allergies are rare. It is often used for spinal anesthesia (saddle block) withoutepinephrine or epidural anesthesia with epinephrine. The prevalence of maternal hypotension may be higher with lidocaine than with bupivacaine. Both the quality and the duration of 590anesthesia are improved by the addition of fentanyl. The topical application of 2% lidocaine gel decreases perineal pain in women with genital herpes. Lidocaine is a second option for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias after failed electrical cardioversion. Side effects include tinnitus, blurred vision, light-headedness, impaired swallowing, seizures, respiratory arrest, arrhythmia, heart block, bradycardia, asthma, coma, tremor, confusion,hypotension, hallucinations, agitation, N/V, and cardiovascular collapse. #Fetal Considerations ........... Lidocaine rapidly crosses the human placenta, and its elimination t/2 after birth approximates 3h. Lidocaine administered by the perineal route has a T maxof 15min, significantly lower than when the drug is administered peridurally; M:F ratios in this instance approximate 1:2 at the time of delivery. It is not placenta-bound.The results of neurobehavioral exams of newborns whose mothers received continuous epidural analgesia are conflicting. Some suggest a decrease in muscle strength and tone, while others findno effect. Lidocaine can potentially produce neonatal CNS depression and seizures. There are no reports of associatedmalformations. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing noevidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doseshigher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Lidocaine is excreted into breast milk, but the maternal systemic levels are low.

Lindane popular OTC treatment for scabies. The number of suspected adverse reactions is small considering over 10 million ounces of 1% lindane are sold yearly. Almost all suspected adverse drug reactions involve misuse. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of lindane in pregnant women. However, lindane is stored in fat, and rodent studies describe a reduction in uterine gap junction synthesis and,as a result, incoordination of uterine contractions.Side effects include seizures, neurotoxicity, dizziness, eczema, dermatitis, anxiety, insomnia, and myelosuppression. 593#Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Lindane likely crosses and is stored in the human placenta. It is a known neurotoxin. One report describesa suicide attempt with oral ingestion at 16w followed immediatelyby fetal death and vaginal bleeding. Fortunately, the maternal systemic concentrations after topical application (cream or shampoo) are low. An increased prevalence of IUGR has beensuggested. Transfer across the rabbit placenta occurs but isinefficient. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. Lindane transiently reduces fetal serum T 4in sheep. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Lindane is excreted into human milk at low concentrations (0-113ppb) and may also be present due toenvironmental contamination; it is unlikely the neonate would ingest a clinically relevant amount. However, if this is a concern, the neonate may be bottle fed for 2d. #Drug Interactions ................ Oils may enhance absorption; therefore, simultaneous use ofcreams, ointments, or oils should be avoided. If an oil-based hairdressing is used, it is recommended that the hair be shampooed,rinsed, and dried before application of lindane shampoo. #References .........................

It is also a nonselective MAOI. This family ofdrugs is useful in the treatment of aerobic gram-positive and-negative bacteria infections. There is no published experiencewith linezolid during pregnancy. Side effects include thrombocytopenia, pseudomembranous colitis, leukopenia, pancytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, headache,N/V, dyspepsia, localized abdominal pain, pruritus, tongue discoloration, and rash. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether linezolid crosses the human placenta. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing noevidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doseshigher than those used clinically. Embryotoxicity is noted onlyat doses causing maternal toxicity. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether linezolid enters human breast milk. It is excreted into rat milk, achieving an M:P ratio near unity. #Drug Interactions ................ A reversible, nonselective MAOI, linezold may interact with adrenergic and serotonergic agents. Some individuals experience a reversible enhancement of the pressor response to indirect-acting sympathomimetic agents, vasopressors, or of adrenergic (e.g., dopamine, epinephrine ) should be reduced and titrated. The serotonin syndrome may manifest after co-administration of linezolid and serotonergic agents, including antidepressants such as SSRIs. Patients should be closely observed for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome (e.g., cognitive dysfunction, hyperpyrexia, should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if the benefit justifies the potential perinatal risk. /C15There are alternative agents for which there is more experience during pregnancy and lactation. 595Liothyronine \u2014(Cytomel; Triostat) International Brand Name\u2014 Cynomel (Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, France, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, South Africa); ..... Liothyronine is synthetic T 3. Myxedema coma is a potentially lethal manifestation of hypothyroidism. Patients with suspected myxedema coma should be immediately admitted to an ICU for aggressive pulmonary and CV support. Most authorities recommend treatment with IV levothyroxine rather than IV liothyronine. Hydrocortisone is also administered until coexisting adrenal insufficiency is excluded. Advanced age, cardiac complications, and high-dose thyroid hormone replacement (>500mcg/d) are associated with a fatal outcome within 1mo of treatment. Amiodarone -induced hypothyroidism may also be life-threatening, and thyroid function should be tested before andduring amiodarone therapy. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of liothyronine in pregnant women. There are no reports of myxedema coma during pregnancy. Side effects include headache, irritability, nervousness, sweating, tachycardia, increased bowel motility, menstrual irregularities, shock, insomnia, tremor, arrhythmia, weight loss, heatintolerance, and diaphoresis. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofliothyronine in human fetuses. Transfer of natural T 3across the human placenta is low but physiologically relevant. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... It is unknown whether liothyronine enters human breast milk. However, several studies conclude the amount of thyroid hormone present in human milk is too low to clinically affect the neonate. It is unknown whether supplementation increases thelevel. #Drug Interactions ................ Thyroid hormones increase the catabolism of vitaminK-dependent clotting factors. Normal compensatory increases inclotting factor synthesis are impaired when oral anticoagulants arealso given. Patients stabilized on oral anticoagulants found to require thyroid replacement therapy should be closely watched when thyroid hormone is begun. If a patient is truly hypothyroid,it is likely a reduction in anticoagulant dosage will be required. No special precautions appear necessary when oral anticoagulant therapy is begun in a patient already stabilized on maintenancethyroid replacement therapy.Initiating thyroid replacement may increase insulin or oral hypoglycemic requirements. Patients receiving insulin or oral 596hypoglycemics should be closely watched during the initiation of thyroid replacement. Estrogens increase serum thyroid-binding globulin, and free levothyroxine may be decrease when estrogens are begun. If the patient's thyroid gland has sufficient function, the decreased free T4will trigger a compensatory increase in T 4release. However, patients without a functioning thyroid gland may need an increased dose if estrogens or estrogen-containing oralcontraceptives are given. Imipramine and other TCAs may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity; transient cardiac arrhythmias are reported. Thyroid hormone activity may also be enhanced.May potentiate the toxic effects of digitalis. Thyroid hormone replacement increases the metabolic rate, which requires an increase in digitalis dosage.Ketamine may cause hypertension and tachycardia. Use with caution and be prepared to treat hypertension. May increase adrenergic effects of catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. Use of vasopressors in patients receiving thyroid hormone preparations may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency, especially in those with CAD. Use caution when administering vasopressors with liothyronine. Cholestyramine binds both T 4and T 3in the intestine, thus impairing absorption of these thyroid hormones. In vitro studies indicate that the binding is not easily removed. Allow at least4-5h between administration of cholestyramine and thyroid hormones. #References .........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of lisinopril in pregnant women. In general, inhibitors of the renin- angiotensin system are contraindicated throughout pregnancy. The lowest dose effective should be used when lisinopril is required during pregnancy for BP control.Side effects include fetal and neonatal morbidity and pruritus, and rash. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Lisinopril crosses the human placenta. No adverse fetal effects are reported following 1st trimester exposure. However, such adverse events are well-documented after the ingestion of other ACEIs. Later exposure is associated with cranial hypoplasia, anuria, and PDA. The mechanismof renal dysfunction is likely related to fetal hypotension and prolonged decreased glomerular filtration. If oligohydramnios is detected, lisinopril should be discontinued unless lifesaving for the mother. Antenatal surveillance should be initiated (e.g., BPP)if the fetus is potentially viable. Oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has irreversible injury. Neonates exposed in utero to ACEIs should be observed closely for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria occurs despite adequatepressure and renal perfusion, exchange transfusion or peritoneal dialysis may be required. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether lisinopril enters human breast milk. Other ACEIs (e.g., captopril ) are excreted in the milk at low concentrations. #Drug Interactions ................ Patients on diuretics, especially those recently started, may occasionally become hypotensive after the initiation of lisinopril. 599The risk of hypotension can be reduced by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to starting the lisinopril. If it is necessary to continue the diuretic, initiate therapy with lisinopril at a dose of 5mg daily, and provide close medical supervision after the initial dose until BP has stabilized.An additional antihypertensive effect is typically observed when a diuretic is added to the therapy of a patient receiving lisinopril. In some patients with comprised renal function who are beingtreated with NSAIDs, lisinopril may trigger a further deterioration of renal function. These effects are usuallyreversible. Further, the antihypertensive effect of lisinopril may be reduced by indomethacin. Attenuates potassium loss caused or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to hyperkalemia. Therefore, this combination should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. Potassium-sparing agents should generally not be used in patients with heart failurewho are receiving lisinopril. Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving ACEIs. It is usually reversible upon discontinuation of lithium and the ACEI. Monitor lithium levels frequently if lisinopril is al. Arch Dis Child FetalNeonatal Ed 2003; 88:F154-6. Noble TA, Miller LJ.

Lithium is used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. It is typically inadequate for the rapid control of acute mania; antipsychotics, divalproex, or sedatives are commonly used, with or without lithium in these instances. The usefulness of lithium lies in the long-term prevention of recurrent mania and bipolar depressionand in reducing risk of suicidal behavior. Among patients treated fora bipolar disorder, the risk of a suicide attempt is lower duringtreatment with lithium than it is with divalproex. Pregnancy and especially the puerperium are times high risk for recurrence ofbipolar disease. Recommendations during pregnancy includediscontinuing therapy for at least the 1st trimester, switching to anagent with a less controversial profile (e.g., tricyclics), using smaller doses of lithium, and avoiding sodium restriction or diuretics while under treatment. However, discontinuation during pregnancy of mood stabilizer, particularly abruptly, carries a high risk for newmorbidity in women with bipolar disease, especially for early depressive and dysphoric states. This risk is reduced markedly by continued mood stabilizer treatment. Treatment planning forpregnant women with bipolar disease should consider not just the relative risks of fetal exposure but also the high risk of recurrence and morbidity associated with stopping therapy. The dose usedshould be titered to maintain a serum level between 0.5-1.2mEq/L.Toxicity develops between 1.5 and 2.0mEq/L. Ideally, the drug should be tapered gradually over a month. Lithium levels should be monitored weekly after 35w gestation, and therapy either discontinued or decreased by 1=42-3d before delivery. 601Side effects include tremor, muscle fasciculations, retardation, restlessness, confusion, stupor, coma, tongue movements, tics, tinnitus,hallucinations, poor memory, slowed intellectual functioning,startled response, polyuria, diarrhea, vomiting, Lithium crosses the placenta; the F:M ratio approximates 1 across a wide range of maternal concentrations (0.2-2.6mEq/L). Infantswith higher lithium concentrations ( >0.64mEq/L) at delivery have significantly lower Apgar scores, longer hospital stays, and higher rates of CNS and neuromuscular complications. Withholding lithium therapy for 24-48h before delivery decreases the maternal lithium concentration an average of 0.28mEq/L. Several studies note an increased prevalence of Ebstein's anomaly, though this was not confirmed in a prospective, multicenter study. The main effects attributable to lithium are cardiac malformations and increased birth weight. A targeted ultrasoundperformed by a fetal medicine expert is suggested. Fetuses of depressed mothers are more active during midgestation and exhibit lower baseline HRs and move less during late-termvibratory stimulation. Midgestation heightened activity and late- term diminished responsivity may be a prenatal manifestation of the ''general adaptation syndrome.'' SSRIs increase middlecerebral artery velocity while lithium decreases it. Neonatal complications often attributed to lithium include poor respiratory effort and cyanosis, rhythm disturbances, nephrogenicdiabetes insipidus, thyroid dysfunction and goiter, hypoglycemia,hypotonia and lethargy, polyhydramnios, hyperbilirubinemia, andlarge-for-gestational-age infant. As a result, the delivery of a mother taking lithium should be considered a high-risk delivery. However, the results of long-term follow-up studies are reassuring as are the most recent epidemiologic studies. Animal studies using doses producing serum levels similar to therapeutic human levels have not reported any abnormalities, though higher doseshave produced exencephaly, skeletal and craniofacial defects, andabnormalities of blood vessel development. Experiments with other vertebrates suggest lithium affects dorsoventral specification and inhibition of vasculogenesis. Both these effects can be prevented by pretreatment with myoinositol, indicating thatlithium interferes with the phosphatidylinositol cycle. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Lithium is excreted into human milk and can be measured in the nursing newborn. Maternal serum, breast milk, and infant serumdaily trough levels of lithium are reported to average 0.76, 0.35, and 0.16mEq/L, respectively, each level lower than the precedingby approximately 1=2. In this study, no serious adverse events were observed, and elevations of TSH and BUN/Cr were few, minor, and transient. #Drug Interactions ................ An encephalopathic syndrome (characterized by weakness, lethargy, fever, tremulousness and confusion, extrapyramidal symptoms, leukocytosis, and elevated serum enzymes, BUN, and 602fasting blood sugar) followed by irreversible brain damage has occurred in a few patients treated with lithium plus haloperidol. A causal relationship has not been establishedMay prolong the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents.Sodium loss secondary to diuretic use may reduce the renal clearance of lithium and increase the risk of toxicity. When such combinations are used, the lithium dosage may need to be decreased, and frequent monitoring of plasma levels is recommended. Toxicity has resulted from interactions with NSAIDs. Indomethacin andpiroxicam have been reported to increase steady-state plasma lithium concentrations. There is evidence other NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, have the same effect. Use of metronidazole may trigger lithium toxicity due to reduced renal clearance. Patients receiving such combined therapyshould be monitored closely. ACEIs (e.g., captopril, enalapril ) and II receptor antagonists (e.g., losartan ) can increase steady-state plasma lithium levels, sometimes causing in lithium toxicity. Lithium dosage may need to be decreased, and plasma lithium levels measured more often. Use with calcium channel blocking agents may increase the riskof neurotoxicity in the form of ataxia, tremors, N/V, diarrhea, and/or tinnitus. Caution is recommended. Use with SSRIs should be undertaken cautiously as thecombination may cause diarrhea, confusion, tremor, dizziness,and agitation. Acetazolamide, urea, xanthine preparations, and alkalinizing agents such as sodium bicarbonate may lower serum lithium concentrations by increasing urinary lithium excretion.Extended use of iodide preparations, especially potassium iodide, may produce hypothyroidism. May impair mental and/or physical abilities. Patients should becautioned about activities requiring alertness (e.g., operating vehicles or machinery). #References .........................

Loratadine is a 2nd-generation antihistamine with minimal sedating effect. It is a first-line agent for the treatment of allergic rhinorrhea. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of loratadine in pregnant women. Side effects include bronchospasm, hepatitis, fatigue, headache, somnolence, dry mouth, nervousness, and abdominal pain. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether loratadine crosses the human placenta. Prospective human studies reveal no adverse outcomes. In 2002, a Swedish study observed that, among male infants born to women who took loratadine for seasonal allergies, the prevalence of hypospadias was twice that of the generalpopulation. However, the CDC recently analyzed data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study and determined there was no increased risk for 2nd or 3rd degree hypospadias in the 609male offpring of women who used loratadine in early pregnancy. This conclusion is confirmed by a recent Danish study. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Loratadine and its active metabolite, descarboethoxyloratadine, pass easily into human breast milk, achieving concentrationsalmost equivalent to maternal plasma. However, the total doseabsorbed by the breastfeeding neonate is <1%. #Drug Interactions ................ No clinically relevant interactions identified. #References .........................

There is a growing appreciation that the purported risks of lorazepam during pregnancy are smaller than first thought. Women in need of the therapy should not be denied it solelybecause of the pregnancy. Although nonpharmacologicapproaches to the treatment of insomnia are first-line therapy, intermediate-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam and temazepam may be useful in some circumstances. Lorazepam reverses the hypothermia associated with neuraxial anesthesia utilizing bupivacaine, morphine, andfentanyl. Side effects include respiratory depression, withdrawal syndrome, blood dyscrasias, gangrene, dependency,sedation, dizziness, weakness, ataxia, nystagmus, agitation, urinary incontinence, change in appetite, delirium, and pain at the injection site. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Lorazepam crosses the human placenta. High peak concentrations are avoided by dividing the daily dose into 2 or 3. While there are many studies of benzodiazepine use in human pregnancy, data on teratogenicity and effects on postnatal development and behavior are limited and conflicting. Earlystudies suggested that 1st trimester exposure to benzodiazepineswas associated with an increased risk of facial clefts and cardiac malformations. Subsequent studies contradicted that conclusion, finding no clear evidence of an increase in either the overallincidence of malformations or any particular type of defect.Benzodiazepine use in the 3rd trimester or during labor may cause the floppy infant syndrome or neonatal withdrawal. There is no increase in jaundice at term. Rodent studies are for themost part reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. In other rodent studies, prenatal exposure to somebenzodiazepines is associated with behavioral and neurochemicalalterations in the early postnatal period that may persist into adulthood. Studies in humans document an effect at least up to 18mo of age. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Lorazepam is excreted into human breast milk. It has been estimated the breastfed neonate ingests <1% of the maternal dose, a dose that should be clinically insignificant. Using thelowest effective quantity in divided doses to minimize drug peaks could further minimize any theoretic risk. #Drug Interactions ................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of lovastatin in pregnant women. The limited information available on the effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on pregnancy suggests similar outcomes as the general, nonexposed population. Hypercholesterolemia is a chronic problem. Discontinuation of lovastatin during pregnancy is unlikely to increase maternal morbidity.Side effects include rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, dyspepsia, constipation, and LFTs. #Fetal Considerations ........... Cholesterol and other products of the cholesterol biosynthesis are essential components for fetal development. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of lovastatin in human fetuses. It is unknown whether it crosses the human placenta, and there is limited follow-up study. Lovastatin is lipophilic and should equilibrate between maternal and fetal compartments. Retrospective series tend to raise the mostsuspicion. For example, one review of 214 pregnancy exposures to one of several statins with 70 informative cases noted 31 adverse outcomes, including 22 cases with structural defects, 4 cases of 612IUGR, and 5 fetal deaths. Cerivastatin andlovastatin were associated with reports of severe midline CNS defects; simvastatin, lovastatin, andatorvastatin were each associated with reports of limb deficiencies. None were reported after exposure to pravastatin, which is poorly transported across the placenta. These authors concluded that statins may havesecondary effects on sterol-dependent morphogens such as SonicHedgehog. A more recent survey included 225 prospectiveoutcomes reported for lovastatin specifically: 154 live-born infants, 49 elective abortions, 18 spontaneous abortions, and 4fetal deaths. Six congenital anomalies were reported:chromosomal translocation, trisomy 18, hypospadias, duodenalatresia, cleft The rate of congenital anomalies (congenital anomalies/live births plus fetal deaths) was 3.8%, which is similar to the background population rate (3.2%; relativeratio, 1.21; 95% 1-sided upper CI, 2.02). Skeletal abnormalitieswere also noted when the administered dose of lovastatin exceeded 40 /C2the MRHD. Some animal studies suggest the statin drugs might be neuroprotective against hypoxic/ischemicstroke. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. Smallquantities of lovastatin apparently enter human breast milk, but the kinetics are unknown. Statin drugs inhibit prolactin release in the rat brain, and theoretically could interfere with the initiation of lactation. #Drug Interactions ................

The risk of myopathy is also increased by the following lipid- lowering drugs that are not potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, but can cause myopathy themselves: gemfibrozil, other niacin (nicotinic acid) (=1g/d). The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by use with cyclosporine ordanazol particularly with higher doses of lovastatin.The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased when eitheramiodarone orverapamil is used concomitantly with a closely related member of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor class.In one small clinical trial in which lovastatin was administered to warfarin -treated patients, no effect on PT was detected. However, another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor has been found to produce a <2sec increase in PT in healthy volunteers. Also, bleeding and/or increased PT have been reported in a few patients taking coumarin anticoagulants with lovastatin. The PT should be determined before starting lovastatin and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significantalteration occurs. #References .........................

The pharmacokinetic profile of magnesium sulfate after IV administration is best described by a 2-compartment model witha rapid distribution (alpha) phase, followed by a relatively slowbeta phase of elimination. The clinical effect and toxicity of magnesium is linked to its plasma concentration. A decreased GFR may lead to toxicity if not monitored closely. Use only 1=2 the usual load when the plasma Cr exceeds 1.3mg/dl. DTRs aredecreased as the concentration exceeds 4mEq/L; they are lost as the level approaches 10mEq/L. Potentially, lethal respiratory depression may occur at 12-15mEq/L. Recent investigationsuggests the measurement of total magnesium is not adequate fortitration in women with either preeclampsia or preterm labor as there is poor correlation between total magnesium and the physiologically active ionized magnesium. Calcium gluconate should always be readily available to counteract potential serious signs of magnesium intoxication. Preeclampsia remains a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and death. Randomized trials demonstrate magnesium sulfate infusion halves the risk of eclampsia and is superior to both phenytoin anddiazepam for the prevention of recurrent eclamptic seizures. The anticonvulsant effect is probably exertedon the cerebral cortex. It is also the drug of choice for the controlof seizures. Magnesium sulfate isNOT an effective antihypertensive, though Mg 2+concentrations between 2 and 4mmol/L produce greater than half the maximal lowering ofsystolic and diastolic pressures. There remains controversy as to whether magnesium sulfate is beneficial for the treatment of mild preeclampsia. A recent analysis concluded that the risks and benefits of magnesium in this patient population counterbalanceeach other. Although a no-magnesium strategy results in a 15% 619reduction in neonatal mortality and avoids maternal drug toxicity, it leads to a 2-fold increase in maternal death and more neurologically compromised neonates compared to empiric magnesium. The clinical decision to use magnesium in womenwith mild preeclampsia for seizure prophylaxis should be determined by the physician or institution, considering patient values or preferences and the unique risk:benefit trade-off of eachstrategy. However, magnesium sulfate treatment clearly does not prevent the worsening of preeclampsia during labor. Approximately 10-15% of eclamptic women convulse despite prophylaxis. An additional 2g loading dose is recommended if awoman convulses while receiving magnesium sulfate for the prevention of eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate may also be administered IM. Prospective studies comparing magnesium levelsachieved with continuous IV infusion and IM reveal thattherapeutically effective levels are achieved with both. Magnesium sulfate neither prolongs labor nor increases the oxytocin requirement in preeclamptic women. Magnesium sulfate is often continued for at least 24h postpartum, but there is little scientificsupport for the practice. The duration of therapy may be individualized using maternal diuresis ( >200ml/h for at least 2h) as evidence the associated vasospasm has resolved. In one study, women with mild preeclampsia received shorter courses ofmagnesium sulfate (mean 9.5 \u00b1 4.2h) than those with severe preeclampsia alone (mean \u00b1 6.7h). Therewas no eclampsia, and recovery room time was reduced 50%. Preterm labor: No tocolytic agent has been proven to stop preterm labor and improve perinatal outcome. The demonstrable benefit of tocolysis is the time gained to administer corticosteroids. Magnesium sulfate depresses uterine contractility both in vitro and in vivo. Although it has no effect on the labor of preeclamptic women, it is the most commonly used parenteral tocolytic in the US, believed effective in stopping contractions in 60-80% of patients for 48-72h. Unfortunately, the scientific support for this belief is weak, and several in-depth analysesconclude there is stronger evidence for the use of other agentswith fewer side effects. The most recent Cochrane Review noted that>2000 women participated in 23 trials but that only 9 trials adequately concealed allocation. In the magnesium sulfate vs. control (all studies) comparisons, there was no difference for therisk of birth <48h (relative risk [RR] 0.85, 95% CI 0.58-1.25, 11 trials, 881 women). There was also no reduction in the risk of giving birth at <37w or <34w. The risk of perinatal death was higher for the magnesium sulfate group (RR 2.82, 95% CI 1.20-6.62, 7 trials, 727 infants). These reviewers conclude thatmagnesium sulfate isineffective in delaying birth or preventing preterm birth, and its use may even be associated with anincreased perinatal mortality. While smaller trials have variously concluded that magnesium sulfate is as effective as one of several tocolytic agents, including nifedipine, it is not risk-free. Pulmonary edema and CV problems occur at a frequency similar to that with b-mimetics ( /C241%). Maternal infection, decreased colloid osmotic pressure, and fluid overload are each predisposingrisk factors. A recent decision analysis examining costs concludedthatnifedpine andindomethacin offered greater value as tocolytic agents. There is no evidence to support the practice ofweaning the magnesium sulfate infusion rate when the decision is made to stop tocolysis.Side effects include respiratory failure, CV collapse, hypothermia, depressed cardiac pulmonary edema, depressed reflexes, 620hypotension, drowsiness, N/V, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, flushing, blurred vision, sweating, muscle ECG changes, sedation, and confusion. #Fetal Considerations ........... Parenterally administered magnesium crosses the placenta andincreases the fetal level. Though there is some controversy, there is no clear evidence of adverse effects from short-termmagnesium sulfate therapy. Respiratory depression may occur if there is severe hypermagnesemia at delivery. Rodent studies suggest maternal seizures may be associated with fetal brain injury, an effect possibly ameliorated by magnesium sulfate. Some human studies also suggest a protective effect ofmagnesium sulfate against cerebral palsy in very low-birth-weight infants. Magnesium sulfate was given to >500 women <30w who were expected to deliver within 24h; the children werefollowed until a corrected age of 2y. Children exposed tomagnesium had a significantly lower rate of substantial gross motor function. In another recent RCT enrolling 2241 women 24-31w, magnesium sulfate reduced the rate of cerebral palsy in survivors. Thus, additional large clinical trials are needed to resolve the controversy. Maternal administration does not protect against neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis. It remains controversialwhether the intrapartum administration reduces fetal heart variability and reactivity. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Some case reports describe engorgement and galactorrhea duringtocolysis with IV magnesium sulfate. The mechanism remains unknown. Symptoms gradually subside after discontinuation. Magnesium is normally present in human breast milk, and its concentration stable throughout the 1st year of lactation. It isunknown whether magnesium sulfate increases the magnesium content of breast milk. Considering the indication and dosing,limited use is unlikely to pose a clinically significant risk to thebreastfeeding neonate. #Drug Interactions ................ The dose systemicanesthetics), or CNS depressants should adjusted becauseof the additive CNS depressant effects of magnesium.CNS depression and peripheral transmission defects produced by magnesium may be antagonized by calcium. #References .........................

Meclofenamate is a nonsteroidal agent with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities. It has little effect on human platelet function. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of meclofenamate in pregnant women. In rodents, meclofenamate induces luteolysis as indicated by the drop in maternal progesterone after administration. Luteolysis is followed by spontaneous labor. In contrast, in vitro studies demonstrate meclofenamate inhibits myometrial contractility. Meclofenamate is a popular analgesic for the treatment of postpartum pain after vaginal delivery. Side effects include anaphylaxis, GI bleeding, bronchospasm, renal failure, interstitial nephritis, hepatic failure, syndrome, There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether meclofenamate crosses the human placenta. Similar-class agents do cross, cause fetal ductal constriction and decreased fetal urination. Because of the potential for premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus aftermaternal use of NSAIDs, chronic mefenamic acid treatment during pregnancy is not recommended without fetal monitoring. Fetal exposure should be minimized until completion of future studies since meclofenamate may affect fetal breathing movements and pulmonary vascular resistance. Rodent studiesreveal that meclofenamate, likeaspirin and other NSAIDs, can cause fetotoxicity and minor skeletal malformations (e.g.,supernumerary ribs, delayed ossification) but no majorteratogenicity. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women.Meclofenamate enters human breast milk, though the kinetics remain to be elucidated. 631#Drug Interactions ................ Enhances the effect of warfarin, and the warfarin dose should be reduced to prevent excessive prolongation of the PT or INR.

It can be combined with an injectable estrogen. It is estimated that 68% of women who become pregnant after discontinuing conceive within 12mo, 83%within 15mo, and 93% within 18mo. If bone density does decline,it is reversible and unlikely to adversely influence clinical events either acutely or later. Because of the indications, it is inevitable 632that numerous pregnant women are exposed to medroxyprogesterone since many pregnancies will not be recognized until after the 1st trimester. Progestational agents(i.e., not native progesterone ) such as medroxyprogesterone were long used during early pregnancy to prevent 1st trimester spontaneous abortion. The wisdom of this practice cannot be substantiated. It is speculated that progestational agents maydelay spontaneous abortion in women with defective ova. Whilethere are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of medroxyprogesterone in pregnant women, epidemiologic studies are reassuring as there is no demonstrable increase in the prevalence of ectopic pregnancy. Medroxyprogesterone is also commonly used as adjunctive therapy for endometrial cancer or adenomatous hyperplasia, especially in young women who wish to preserve fertility for the near term.Side effects include thromboembolism, stroke, MI, hepatic adenoma, disease, cholestatic jaundice, hypertension, stroke, amenorrhea, N/V, breast gain, Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of medroxyprogesterone in human fetuses. In utero exposure of male fetuses to progestational agents may double the risk ofhypospadias. While there are insufficient data to quantify the riskfor the female fetus, some progestational agents may cause mildvirilization of the external genitalia. Defects outside the external genitalia are not noted in either humans or rodents. 1st trimester exposure is an indication for a detailed anatomic ultrasoundbetween 18 and 22w. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

Because of the potential for premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus after maternal use of NSAIDs, chronic mefenamic acid treatment during pregnancy is not recommended without fetal monitoring. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... The trace amounts of mefenamic acid excreted into breast milk pose no clinical risk to the nursing infant. #Drug Interactions ................ Mefenamic acid is a CYP2C9 substrate, and a number of compounds are recognized inhibitors of CYP2C9. However, druginteractions studies of mefenamic acid and these compounds have not been conducted. May reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides presumably by the inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. The patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure,as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. NSAIDs can increase plasma lithium levels (15%) by decreasing renal lithium clearance, presumably by inhibiting renal prostaglandin synthesis. Patients should be observed carefully forsigns of lithium toxicity. NSAIDs competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. Caution is advised when NSAIDs are administered with methotrexate. The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk ofserious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.Antacids containing magnesium hydroxide may increase the C max and AUC of mefenamic acid by 125% and 36%, respectively. May prolong PT. Frequent monitoring of PT is necessary whenmefenamic acid is given to patients receiving oral anticoagulant drugs.A false-positive reaction for urinary bile, using may result after mefenamic acid.

Malaria remains an important cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality in endemic countries. P. falciparum drug resistance increasingly limits the effectiveness of antimalarial therapy. Mefloquine is the most effective agent for the prevention of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria. The WHO favors mefloquine prophylaxis in pregnant women from 16w onward. Mefloquine andquinine are the only antimalarials generally available for the treatment of drug-resistant P. falciparum during pregnancy. Prospective studies show mefloquine (25mg/kg) in combination with artesunate (4mg/kg/d for 3d) is more effective than quinine (10mg/kg q8h) for the treatment of multidrug-resistant falciparum malariaduring pregnancy. Many of the adverse effects of mefloquine reflect primary hepatic damage or symptomatic thyroid disturbances, which might occur either independently or as a secondary consequence of the hepatocellular injury. Routineintermittent treatment of women in endemic locales has beensuggested. Side effects include seizures, hallucinations, ECG conduction pruritus, hair loss. #Fetal Considerations ........... Prophylactic (250mg/w) mefloquine during early pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of malformations and is not an indication for pregnancy termination. Similarly, 2nd trimesterexposure is not associated with adverse reactions. Mefloquine is associated with an increased risk of stillbirth but not abortion, IUGR, neurologic retardation, or congenital malformations. Rodent studies reveal high doses is teratogenic and embryotoxic. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. The detectable amounts of drug identified in themilk of mothers receiving mefloquine are too small to be clinically relevant. 636#Drug Interactions ................ Use with related compounds (e.g., chloroquine, quinidine, quinine ) may produce ECG abnormalities and increase the risk of convulsions. If these drugs are to be used in the initial treatment of severe malaria, mefloquine administration should be delayed at least 12h after the last dose. Because of the potential for fatal prolongation of the QTc interval, halofantrine should not be given simultaneously with or subsequent to mefloquine. Theoretically, use with other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (e.g., antiarrhythmic or b-adrenergic blocking agents, antihistamines or H 1-blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, phenothiazines, TCAs) might also contribute to prolongation of the QTc interval. There are no data. May reduce seizure control by lowering the plasma levels of anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproic acid ). Monitor blood levels and adjust the dose appropriately. May attenuate the immune response to oral live typhoid vaccine. Vaccinations composed of attenuated live bacteria should becompleted at least 3d before the first dose. #References ......................... Bounyasong S.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of melatonin in pregnant women. Melatonin is a natural hormone (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) produced by the pineal gland with antioxidant properties. Its secretion is stimulated by the darkand inhibited by light. Secretion disturbances have beenassociated with depression. Rodent studies suggest that melatonin is involved in the initiation of parturition without having a directeffect on progesterone secretion. In humans, melatonin may also modulate myometrial function, as receptors are present.Side effects include fatigue, depression, constriction of the coronary arteries, possible effects on fertility, and pruritus. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Melatonin rapidly crosses the isolated human placenta equal to the freely diffusible marker antipyrine. It peroxidase in andinhibits the vasospastic of oxidized lipids. It also crosses the rodent placenta, and fetal rodents respond to the maternal melatonin rhythm. Melatonin may offer some protection for ischemia/reperfusion-induced oxidative mitochondrial damage tothe fetal rat brain. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. In both human and rodent breast milk, melatonin is undetectable in the light but increases rapidly after dark. The M:P ratio ranges from 0.35 to 0.8, and melatonin is believed responsible for shifting the newborn to the circadian rhythm of the mother. 639#Drug Interactions ................

Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal agent with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities. There is no published clinical experience during pregnancy. In the ewe, meloxicam is an inhibitor of uterine contractions. It, with indomethacin, is a modest inhibitor of preterm labor in rats treated with LPS.In vitro, meloxicam relaxes myometrial strips from pregnant and nonpregnant women, but is less potent than celecoxib. Side effects include anaphylaxis, GI bleeding, bronchospasm, renal nephritis, There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Meloxicam crosses the human placenta. The administration of high doses to rodents is associated withcardiac septal defects and embryotoxicity. Meloxicam attenuates RU486-stimulated labor in sheep. Because of the potential for premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus after maternal use of NSAIDs, chronic meloxicam treatment during pregnancy is not recommended without fetal monitoring. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether meloxicam enters human breast milk. It does enter rodent milk. #Drug Interactions ................ NSAIDs may decrease the antihypertensive effect of ACEIs.Use with aspirin (1000mg tid) in healthy volunteers tends to increase the AUC (10%) and C max(24%) of meloxicam. The clinical significance is not known. As with other NSAIDs, concomitant use of meloxicam andaspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects. The use of low-dose aspirin with meloxicam may increase the rate of GI ulceration or other complications.Cholestyramine for 4d increased the clearance of meloxicam by 50%, decreasing the t/2 from 19.2h to 12.5h, and the AUC 35%.This suggests the existence of a recirculation pathway for meloxicam in the GI tract. NSAIDs reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. However, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of both single and multiple doses of furosemide are unaffected by multiple doses of meloxicam. Increases the mean predose lithium level and the AUC by 21% in healthy subjects compared controls receiving lithium alone. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly the first few days after initiating or changing meloxicam therapy, in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding. The effect of meloxicam on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in healthy subjects receiving doses of warfarin that produced an INR between 1.2 and 1.8. In these subjects, meloxicam did not alter either warfarin pharmacokinetics or the the average anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by PT. #References .........................

It is metabolized to another active form, normeperidine. Historically, meperidine was perhaps the most commonly used parenteral opioid during labor for pain relief. Well-designed studies demonstrate that the incidence of cesareandelivery in nulliparous women with epidural analgesia is similar to IV meperidine but, with superior analgesia, less maternal sedation and no need for neonatal naloxone as with meperidine. When used for early labor analgesia, meperidine increases the prevalence of neonatal acidemia. It does not improve outcome 644when given for dystocia. Meperidine does not have in vitro a significant effect on the spontaneous contractions of gravid human myometrium. Postoperatively, PCEA with meperidine offers high-quality pain relief with few side effects. Side effects include respiratory arrest and depression, cardiac arrest, tachydysrhythmias, dependency, abuse, vomiting, sweating,shock, agitation, disorientation, euphoria, pruritus, site of injection. #Fetal Considerations ........... Meperidine crosses the human placenta. It significantly the of FHR accelerations intrapartum, and is associatedwith insufficient fetomaternal gas exchange and fetal acidemia. Meperidine achieves its highest concentration in fetal tissues 2-3h after administration, correlating with the clinical observation thatthe maximal risk of neonatal depression occurs 2-3h after maternal injection. Respiratory depression requiring resuscitation at delivery is a risk. The interval before neonatal respirationbecomes sustained increases if meperidine is given more than 1h before delivery. The greater the drug-to-delivery interval, thehigher the fetal concentration of normeperidine, and the lowerthe newborn's performance on the Brazelton Neonatal BehavioralAssessment Scale. Spontaneous behavior and cognitive performance in exposed rhesus monkeys at 3-12mo of age is altered by meperidine. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Meperidine is excreted into human breast milk, with peak levels occurring about 2h after administration. While a single dose ofmeperidine has little impact on the nursing infant, repeated administration negatively affects the newborn. Nursing infants repeatedly exposed to morphine are more alert and oriented than those exposed repeatedly to meperidine. This makes morphine the preferred narcotic for lactating mothers. #Drug Interactions ................ Use with caution and consider starting with a lower dose in patients who are concurrently receiving other CNS depressants,including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics,phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, and ethanol. Drug-drug interactions may result in respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma if these drugs are taken incombination with the usual doses of meperidine. Employ caution agonist-antagonist analgesics (e.g.,buprenorphine, butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine )t oa patient had or is receiving a pure opioid agonistanalgesic such as meperidine. Mixed agonist-antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of medperidine and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.Acyclovir may increase the plasma concentrations of meperidine and its metabolite, normeperidine. Cimetidine both reduces the clearance and volume of distribution of meperidine and the formation of normeperidine in healthy subjects. Phenytoin may enhance the hepatic metabolism of meperidine, and thus reduce its t/2 and bioavailability in healthy subjects.Ritonavir increases the plasma concentrations of normeperidine and should be avoided. May enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. #References .........................

It increases stroke volume and thus increases both systolic and diastolic BP. There is also a variable degree ofperipheral vasoconstriction. Mephentermine increases HR by the release of epinephrine. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of mephentermine in pregnant women. It has been used during pregnancy to restore or support uteroplacentalblood flow after spinal or epidural analgesia. Though a recent RCT concluded ephedrine andmephentermine had similar efficacy, it has largely been abandoned in favor of ephedrine. Side effects include nervousness, anxiety, arrhythmias, transient extrasystoles, AV block, and hypertension. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether mephentermine crosses the human placenta. Rodent teratogenicity studies have not beenperformed. Studies in animals and humans reveal fetal hypoxiaafter mephentermine presumably secondary to uterine artery constriction and decreased uterine blood flow. Transient fetal hypertension (mean arterial BP >20% of control) is also reported. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether mephentermine enters human breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Cyclopropane and halothane anesthetics increase cardiac automatic irritability and therefore seem to sensitize themyocardium to the action of catecholamine. Hence, use duringcyclopropane and halothane anesthesia is generally considered contraindicated because of the risk of producing ventricular tachycardia or VF.

Seizure control should be sought prior to pregnancy. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of mephobarbital in pregnant women. Clearance is altered by pregnancy and may require frequent adjustment through the puerperium. Mephobarbital must be increased in 85% of pregnancies to maintain therapeutic levels. Barbiturates are hepatic enzymeinducers and alter the clearance of many other drugs. Side effects include drowsiness, sedation, hypnosis, marked excitement, depression, confusion, respiratory angioedema, dependence, hepatitis,and swelling. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofmephobarbital in human fetuses. Barbiturates rapidly cross the human placenta, reaching F:M ratios approaching unity.Retrospective case-control studies suggested a connection between the maternal consumption of barbiturates and a higher than expected incidence of fetal abnormalities. The great majority ofwomen on anticonvulsant medication deliver normal infants.Rodent teratogenicity studies have not apparently been conducted with mephobarbital. 649#Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether mephobarbital enters human breast milk. Small amounts of other barbiturates are excreted. #Drug Interactions ................ Most reports of clinically significant drug interactions with the barbiturates have involved phenobarbital. However, the application of this experience to other barbiturates appears valid and warrants serial blood level determinations of the relevantdrugs when there are multiple therapies. May lower the plasma levels of dicumarol (name previously used: bishydroxycoumarin ), thus causing a decrease in the PT. Barbiturates induce hepatic microsomal enzymes resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response to oral anticoagulants (e.g., acenocoumarol, dicumarol, phenprocoumon, warfarin ). Patients stabilized on anticoagulant therapy may require dose adjustments should a barbiturate be added or withdrawn from their regimen. May enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.Patients stabilized on corticosteroid therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added or withdrawn. May interfere with the absorption of oral griseofulvin, decreasing the blood level.May shorten the t/2 of doxycycline, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize theantibiotic, for as long as 2w after barbiturate therapy isdiscontinued. The clinical response to doxycycline should be monitored closely. Because the effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin is not predictable, phenytoin and barbiturate blood levels should be measured more frequently if these drugs are given concurrently. Valproate andvalproic acid appear to decrease barbiturate metabolism; therefore, barbiturate blood levels should be monitored and appropriate adjustments made asindicated. Use with other CNS depressants, including other sedatives or hypnotics, antihistamines, tranquilizers, or ethanol, may produceadditive depressant effects.MAOIs prolong the effects of barbiturates probably because metabolism of the barbiturate is inhibited. Pretreatment or concurrent use may decrease the effect ofestradiol by increasing its metabolism. There have been reports of women treated with phenobarbital who become pregnant while taking oral contraceptives. used during pregnancy and lactation only if the benefit justifies the potential perinatal risk. /C15There are alternative agents for which there is or class, alcohol consumption /C15Caution \u2014job requiring driving or operating machinery #Maternal Considerations .....

Side effects include dependence, ataxia, slurred speech, vertigo, anxiety, anorexia, insomnia, vomiting, tremors, muscle twitching,confusional states, hallucinosis, convulsive seizures, paresthesias,impairment of visual accommodation, euphoria, arrhythmia, vasomotor and respiratory collapse. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. Meprobamate crosses the human placenta. Several studies suggest an increased prevalence of malformations associated withthe 1st trimester use of minor tranquilizers such as meprobamate, chlordiazepoxide, anddiazepam. However, there was no clear evidence of either teratogenicity or fetotoxicity followingattempted maternal suicide with very large doses. Monotherapyand the lowest effective quantity given in divided doses to minimize the peaks might minimize the risks. While rodent studies reveal that meprobamate reduces the learning ability of mature rodent offspring, this effect is not seen in humans. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... The small amount of meprobamate entering breast milk and ingested by the nursing newborn ( /C244% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose) does not pose a clinically significant risk. #Drug Interactions ................

Mercaptopurine andazathioprine are the most commonly used immunomodulatory agents most commonly encountered during pregnancy in women with inflammatory bowel disease. Bothdrugs require caution. In addition to the listed indications,mercaptopurine is used as an adjunct to prevent organ rejection after transplantation. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of mercaptopurine in pregnant women. Inflammatory bowel disease can be challenging. Women with quiescent disease are likely to have an uncomplicated pregnancy, whereas those with active disease are more likely to sufferspontaneous abortion, stillbirth, IUGR, and exacerbation ofdisease. In women considering pregnancy, an active episode should be treated aggressively and remission accomplished before 652pregnancy is attempted. A woman who unexpectedly conceives while her disease is active should be treated aggressively, as remission provides the greatest hope for a favorable outcome. The treatment of AML typically involves a complex drug regimenthat includes mercaptopurine. Multiple case reports suggest the use of mercaptopurine can produce a complete and sustained remission culminating in the delivery of a normally developedinfant.Side effects include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hepatotoxicity, pain, edema, and bleeding. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of mercaptopurine in human fetuses. It likely crosses the human placenta as transient but severe neonatal bone marrow hypoplasia is reported. The impact of mercaptopurine use during the 1st trimester on development is controversial. Retrospective studies conclude there is no increased prevalence of anomalies. However, a more recent population-based cohort study concluded the riskof malformation is increased more than 6-fold. In a second recent report, the incidence of fetal loss was higher in women with inflammatory bowel disease previously treated withmercaptopurine compared to those who had not been so treated. Whether this was related to their older age at conception, longer duration of disease, initially more severe disease, or use of mercaptopurine could not be determined. Although it was suggested mercaptopurine increases the risk of spontaneous abortion, it proved a poor abortifacient in one prospective trial. Exposure during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters does affect the fetal immune system, and birth weight may be reduced. Toxic effectson the neonatal pancreas, liver, and lymphocytes are reported. Rodent studies reveal teratogenicity perhaps mediated by DNA modification or drug-induced changes in mineral metabolism(zinc). Malformations include cleft palate, microglossia, short limbs, and gut herniation. Zinc supplementation reduces the risk of an adverse effect. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether mercaptopurine enters human breast milk. Until such data become available, it is perhaps best to avoidimmunosuppressive medications while breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Reduce the dose of mercaptopurine1=3to1=4when allopurinol andmercaptopurine are used together to avoid severe toxicity. There is usually complete cross-resistance betweenmercaptopurine andthioguanine. Dose may need to be reduced if combined with other drugswhose primary or secondary toxicity is myelosuppression.Enhanced marrow suppression has been noted in some patientsalso receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Inflammatory bowel disease can be challenging. Women with quiescent disease are likely to have an uncomplicated pregnancy, whereas those with active disease are more likely to suffer spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, IUGR, and exacerbation ofdisease. This is truer for patients with Crohn's disease than those with ulcerative colitis. In women considering pregnancy, an active episode should be treated aggressively and remissionaccomplished before pregnancy is attempted. A woman whounexpectedly conceives while her disease is active should be treated aggressively, as remission provides the greatest hope for a favorable outcome. Mesalamine is a by-product of 5- aminosalicylic acid bound to sulfapyridine. Most patients withadverse effects from sulfasalazine will tolerate mesalamine. Mesalamine is at least equivalent or superior to sulfasalazine, and superior to placebo, with a dose-response benefit, in inducingremission of acute inflammatory bowel disease. It is alsocomparable to sulfasalazine and superior to placebo for long- term maintenance of remission.Side effects include bloody diarrhea, fever, headache, N/V, flatulence,constipation, asthenia, diarrhea, arthralgia, rhinitis, dry elevated BUN/Cr, dysmenorrhea, hair loss, and flu-like symptoms. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. While it is unknown whether mesalamine crosses the human placenta, only trace amounts of the active metabolite, 5-aminosalicylic acid, can be found in the fetus. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically.

Metaraminol is a potent sympathomimetic that increases both systolic and diastolic BP. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of metaraminol in pregnant women. Metaraminol has been used to maintain arterial pressure during spinal anesthesia before cesarean delivery, and for CV support inwomen with septic shock. In vitro, metaraminol is a more potent constrictor of the uterine arteries than ephedrine. The effect is more pronounced in uterine compared to femoral arteries. For that reason, many prefer ephedrine prior to spinal anesthesia. However, a recent RCT suggests metaraminol given as a continuous infusion provides a superior clinical result compared to a continuous infusion of ephedrine. Confirmation of this study would be helpful.Side effects include cardiac arrest, pulmonary edema, hypertension, seizures, arrhythmia, cerebral hemorrhage, anxiety, restlessness, dizziness, headache, N/V, flushing, pallor, and sweating. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether metaraminol crosses the human placenta. Rodent teratogenicity studies have not beenperformed. Fetal bradycardia are well-recognized complications of untreated spinal/epidural analgesia-induced hypotension. They are a product of hypotension secondary to peripheral sympathetic blockade. In studies of spinal anesthesia, metaraminol -treated pregnancies may have a lower incidence of neonatal acidosis compared to ephedrine. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether metaraminol enters human breast milk. 661However, considering the dose and route, it is unlikely the breastfed neonate would ingest clinically relevant amounts. #Drug Interactions ................

Their use remains exciting but investigational.Side effects include flatulence, diarrhea, N/V, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, headache, megaloblastic anemia, anorexia, altered taste, and rash. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses, though there is at least one RCT underway. Metformin crosses the isolated, perfused human placental cotyledon. and 30.98 \u00b1 5.62%, respectively. The clearance index, calculated as the ratio between the permeabilities of metformin and antipyrine, was 0.34 \u00b1 0.05. It does not block placental glucose uptake and transport in the isolated perfused cotyledon model. In limited clinical study, metformin was not teratogenic, and did not adversely affect birth weight, height, weight, or motor and social development at 3 and 6mo of life. Newborns of women who had their serum glucoselevels controlled by metformin do not develop hypoglycemic episodes more frequently than newborns delivered of womentreated by insulin alone. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doseshigher than those used clinically. There is evidence of poor placental transport in the rat. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Only 0.28% of the weight-normalized maternal dose ofmetformin enters human breast milk. In rodents, the metformin concentration in milk approaches that of the maternal plasma. This is well below the 10% level usually expected for theconcentration to have a clinical impact. #Drug Interactions ................ A single-dose, pharmacokinetics metformin -furosemide study in healthy subjects revealed the parameters of both compounds wereaffected by co-administration. Furosemide increased the metformin plasma C maxby 22% and AUC by 15%, without any significant change in metformin renal clearance. When administered with metformin, the C maxand AUC of furosemide were 31% and 12% lower, and the terminal t/2 decreased by 32%without significant change in furosemide renal clearance. Nifedipine increases plasma metformin C maxand AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increases the amount excreted in the urine. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption tubular secretion have the potential to interact with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. Such has been shown between metformin andcimetidine in healthy volunteers, with a 60% increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations and a 40% increase in plasma and whole bloodmetformin AUC. Careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of metformin and/or the interfering drug is recommended.Certain drugs produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss ofglycemic control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid sympathomimetics, calcium channel-blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving metformin, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control. #References .........................

Methadone is a synthetic narcotic analgesic with many actions quantitatively similar to morphine except its intense euphoria. Methadone is a first-line agent for the treatment of heroin addiction. The goal of maintenance is to relieve the narcotic craving, suppress withdrawal, and block the euphoric effects associated with heroin. The majority of patients require 80- 120mg/d or more. Treatment continues for an indefinite period of time. Illicit drug use during pregnancy is a major perinatalhealth issue worldwide. Some 200,000 addicted infants are born each year in the US. Because most drug-addicted women use a variety of illicit agents, the impact of methadone alone is difficult to ascertain. That said, methadone exposure during the entire gestational period is associated with better drug-treatment outcomes (less illicit drug use) but no greater prevalence of severe neonatal abstinence syndrome than women who begin methadonein the 2nd or 3rd trimester. Methadone is nonsedating. A major problem with opiate-addicted women is postoperative pain management. Methadone -maintained women have similar analgesic needs and responses during labor, but require 70% more opiate analgesic after cesarean delivery. It is generally recommended that methadone treatment be continued while short-acting narcotics are given as necessary (preferably on a fixed schedule) to relieve the pain. The elimination rate of methadone is higher and the t/2 lower during pregnancy, perhaps because of a decrease in the fraction absorbed. Methadone is not recommended for obstetric analgesia because its long duration of action increases the probability of neonatal respiratory depression.Patients maintained on this drug react to life problems and stresses with the same symptoms of anxiety as do others. Do not confuse such symptoms with those of withdrawal and try to treat anxiety byincreasing the dose of methadone. The action of methadone in maintenance treatment is limited to the control of narcoticwithdrawal symptoms and is ineffective for relief of general anxiety.Maintenance patients on a stable dose of methadone who experience physical trauma, postoperative pain, or other acute pain will not derive analgesia from their ongoing dose of methadone. Instead, they should be administered analgesics, including opioids, in doses that would otherwise be indicated for non-methadone-treated patients with similar painful conditions. Due to the opioid tolerance induced by methadone, somewhat higher and/or more frequent doses will often be required than would be the case for nontolerant patients when opioids are required. Side effects include euphoria, dysphoria, weakness, insomnia, agitation, visual disturbances, headache, disorientation, seizures, shock, cardiac arrest, respiratory depression or arrest, dizziness,sedation, N/V, sweating, dry mouth, flushing, urinary retention, rash, and thrombocytopenia. #Fetal Considerations ........... Methadone crosses the human placenta; however, transfer in the fetal-to-maternal direction is 10-15% greater than in thematernal-to-fetal direction, suggesting involvement of P-glycoprotein. Daily maternal maintenance treatment reducesfetal breathing and total fetal activity. Trough mean plasmamethadone concentrations decline as gestation progresses from 0.12mg/L in the 1st trimester to 0.07mg/L in the 3rd trimester.The weight-adjusted clearance rates gradually increase from amean of 0.17 to 0.21L/hr/kg during pregnancy, although patterns differed substantially among women. Women (and rodents) who continue heroin use throughout pregnancy have a greater likelihood of preterm birth and IUGR. Infants whose mothers areonmethadone maintenance have higher mean birth weights and head circumferences than those of untreated addicted women. 667It is not associated with respiratory depression. However, the withdrawal is more intense in the methadone -treated group compared to heroin -exposed babies without methadone treatment (convulsions 47.1% vs. 27.1%). Maternal methadone dosage is related to the duration of neonatal hospitalization, neonatal abstinence score, and treatment for withdrawal. Interestingly, neonates who undergo withdrawal have almostundetectable concentrations of methadone in their umbilical cord blood. Heroin supplementation does not alter this dose-response relationship. In one study of selected pregnancies, lowering the maternal methadone dose was associated with both a decreased incidence and severity of neonatal withdrawal. Other case-controlstudy conclude that the maternal methadone level does not correlate with neonatal withdrawal. If true, the maternal benefitsof effective methadone dosing would not be offset by neonatal harm. Methadone does not appear detrimental for fetal brain development. Some reports suggest an increased incidence of SIDS in neonates delivered of mothers who use methadone during pregnancy. This association may be more circumstantial. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Only small quantities of methadone are excreted into human breast milk. It is estimated the average newborn would ingest only 0.05mg methadone per day, an amount too small to reliably prevent neonatal withdrawal. The risk of an adverse event with either breastfeeding or weaning is low. Newborns of narcotics abusers are at risk for withdrawal despite being breastfed by theirmethadone-using mother. Pregnant women on methadonemaintenance therapy are to be encouraged to nurse if they are HIV-negative. #Drug Interactions ................ Users may experience withdrawal symptoms when the lopinavir-ritonavir combination increases the clearance and decreases the plasma levels of methadone. Methadone decreases both the AUC and peak levels of didanosine andstavudine, with a more significant decrease for didanosine.Increases the AUC of zidovudine, which could result in toxic effects. In vitro studies suggest hepatic N-demethylation by CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and to a lesser extent CYP2C9 and CYP2D6.Use with inducers of these enzymes may result in a more rapidmetabolism and decreased efficacy, whereas use with inhibitorsmay reduce metabolism and potentiate methadone's effects. Rifampin markedly reduces methadone levels and and increases the prevalence of withdrawal symptoms.Phenytoin (250mg bid initially for 1d, followed by 300mg qd for 3-4d) causes a 50% reduction in methadone exposure and a concurrent increase in withdrawal symptoms. Upondiscontinuation of phenytoin, the incidence of withdrawal symptoms declines and the methadone level increases to that prior to phenytoin. Methadone -treated patients using strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as azole antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole ), should be carefully monitored and the dose reduced if warranted. Some SSRIs (e.g., fluvoxamine, sertraline ) may increase methadone levels with a resultant increase in opiate effects and/or toxicity. Repeat doses of (400mg q12h for 1d, 65% and 103%, respectively. Increased concentrations of methadone have been associated with toxicity, including QT prolongation. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to methadone is recommended during co-administration.Meperidine may trigger severe reactions in patients concurrently receiving or who have received MAOIs within 14d. While similarreactions have not been reported with methadone, a sensitivity test should be performed during which repeated small,incremental doses of methadone are administered over the course of several hours.May increase blood levels of desipramine. Extreme caution is necessary when any drug known to potentiallyprolong the QT interval is prescribed in conjunction withmethadone. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interactions may occur with concomitant use of methadone and arrhythmogenic agents such as class I and III antiarrhythmics, some neurolepticsand TCAs, and calcium channel blockers.Caution should also be exercised when prescribing methadone with drugs capable of inducing electrolyte disturbances(hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia) that may prolong the QTinterval. These drugs include diuretics, laxatives, and, in rarecases, mineralocorticoid hormones. Can have additive effects when used in conjunction with ethanol, other opioids or CNS depressants, or illicit drugs that cause CNSdepression. Deaths have been reported when methadone was abused in conjunction with benzodiazepines. 52:681-5. Berghella V, Gynecol Geraghty B, Logan Hum Lact 1997; 13:227-30.Gressens 1999; 18:51-61.

Methamphetamine is a CNS stimulant that has no medical indications during pregnancy. The illicit use ofmethamphetamine, also called crystal meth orspeed, is a major health care problem in some locales. It may be injected, smoked,snorted, or ingested orally. Prolonged use leads to dependence.Five-10% of adolescents have tried methamphetamine and its use is associated with risky sexual behaviors. The use of a variant, Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is also becoming more common during pregnancy. Maternal death occurs withusage. Ecstasy users during pregnancy tend to be young andsingle, report psychological morbidity, and have a higher rate of unplanned pregnancies and a higher likelihood of using other 670potentially harmful substances (smoking, heavy alcohol intake, and polydrug usage). Side effects include tachycardia, palpitation, dizziness, dysphoria, overstimulation, euphoria, insomnia, tremor, restlessness, headache, diarrhea, constipation, dry mouth, unpleasant taste, urticaria, decreased libido, stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, stomach cramps, shaking, anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations, structuralchanges to the brain, and suppression of growth. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Methamphetamine crosses the human placenta and produces significant and long-lasting maternal and fetal CVeffects, including a decrease in fetal PaO 2after maternal administration. The latter reflects decreased uteroplacentalperfusion, whereas the observed changes in fetal BP and fetal pHare a direct result of methamphetamine. Children of abusers are at risk for IUGR and preterm birth. Antenatal methamphetamine exposure is associated with postnatal developmental disordersassociated with neuronal damage, enduring cognitive deficits, andgreater risks of neglect and abuse postnatally. Children exposed to methamphetamine antenatally have smaller subcortical volumes and associated neurocognitive deficits compared with a control group. These changes are also associated with abnormalities ofbrain energy metabolism. The neuronal damage may be mediated by free radical formation, affect the serotoninergic and MAO systems, and differ by fetal gender. Rodent studies revealembryotoxicity and an increased incidence of microcephaly,NTDs, incomplete rotation of the body axis, and a tortuous spinal cord. Increased frequencies of clefting, cardiac anomalies, and IUGR are reported in humans. Reliable and sensitivescreening procedures are available using meconium or hair to identify antenatal exposure to illicit drugs. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether methamphetamine enters human breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ May alter insulin requirements in association with decreased dietary intake.May decrease the hypotensive effect of guanethidine suchas the amphetamines should be closely supervised and dosage carefully adjusted. Phenothiazines are reported to antagonize the CNS stimulant action of amphetamines. #References ......................... Anglin MD, Perrochet B, et al.

Several clinical aspects of hyperthyroidism have received special attention in the recent past. Hyperthyroidism associated withhyperemesis gravidarium was originally believed secondary to 676inappropriate secretion of b-hCG. More recently, a mutation in the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor was discovered. It does not require treatment. The most common cause of maternal hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is Graves' disease. Themainstay of treatment is an antithyroid drug, either propylthiouracil ormethimazole . During a 12w study of Graves' hyperthyroidism, a single daily dose of 15mg methimazole was much more effective in the induction of euthyroidism than a single daily dose of 150mg propylthiouracil. Thyroid function tests should be obtained during gestation in women sufferingfrom hyperthyroidism and the dose of methimazole adjusted accordingly to keep T 3and T 4within the upper normal range for these women. The lowest effective dose is recommended. Women previously treated with either a radioactive cocktail or thyroidectomy may still be producing thyroid-stimulatingimmunoglobulin even though they are themselves euthyroid. Ifthe level is elevated, the fetus is at risk and should be referred to a fetal center for evaluation (see Propylthiouracil ). Side effects periarteritis. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Methimazole crosses the human placenta and is an alternative to propylthiouracil for the treatment of fetal hyperthyroidism secondary to thyroid-stimulatingimmunoglobulin. The fetal response is often different than thematernal, and some recommend it be tested directly.Methimazole can induce fetal goiter and even cretinism in a dose-dependent fashion. Recent studies of exposed childrenfollowed until 3-11y reveal no deleterious effects on either thyroidfunction or physical and intellectual development with doses up to 20mg daily. However, rare instances of aplasia cutis (manifest suggesting methimazole may be a weak human teratogen. More recent studies have been unable toconfirm a significant teratogenic difference between methimazole andpropylthiouracil. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Methimazole is excreted in human breast milk, but the quantities are small (2-3%) and neonatal thyroid function unaltered. Severalrecent studies observed no deleterious effects on neonatal thyroid function or on physical and intellectual development of breastfed infants whose mothers were treated with up to 20mg daily. #Drug Interactions ................ The activity of anticoagulants may be potentiated by anti-vitamin K activity secondary to methimazole. Hyperthyroidism may cause increased clearance of b-blockers with a high extraction ratio. A dose reduction of b-adrenergic blockers may be necessary when a hyperthyroid patient becomeseuthyroid. Serum digoxin levels may rise when hyperthyroid patients on a stable digoxin regimen become euthyroid, necessitating a reduction in the dosage of digoxin. Theophylline clearance may decrease when hyperthyroid patients on a stable theophylline regimen become euthyroid; a reduced dose of theophylline may be needed. #References .........................

Methotrexate is an antimetabolite with multiple uses in reproductive-age women, including the treatment of ectopic pregnancy, neoplastic disease, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory conditions. Methotrexate originated in the 1940s when Dr. Sidney Farber at Children's Hospital Boston was testing the effects of folic acid on acute childhood leukemia. Inspired, he asked Lederle Laboratories to synthesize methotrexate. Dr. Farber then administered it to a small group of very ill children. Theremarkable clinical improvement he observed began the era ofmodern cancer chemotherapy.Ectopic pregnancy: Ectopic pregnancy is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Its treatment remains primarily surgical,but medical treatment is routine in some locales. Criteria includeserum b-hCG titer <5000IU/L, at most free fluid confined to the pelvis, and pregnancy diameter <3.5cm. Surgery is preferred after tubal rupture, or with a high potential for rupture, hypotension,and anemia, or a pregnancy >3.5cm diameter. Some report that methotrexate is safe and effective for the treatment of a hemodynamically stable ectopic characterized by an adnexal massup to 5cm, or a b-hCG titer >5000IU/L. Larger trials are needed for confirmation. Treatment often leads to an increase in masssize and should not be considered a sign of failure. Severe abdominal/pelvic pain may follow, and the surgeon must determine whether the pain is secondary to medical treatment orfailure of the methotrexate and rupture of the ectopic. Persistent ectopic pregnancy is usually diagnosed when there is abdominalpain, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, or plateau b-hCG titers. In those situations, methotrexate can be administered a 2nd time. Ten to 20% of treated women ultimately require surgery. Methotrexate does not alter subsequent ovarian reserve. Though the greatest experience is with a tubal ectopic, there are case reports supporting its use in cervical, corneal, interstitial, anduterine incision scar ectopic pregnancies. Oral methotrexate (60mg/m 2) may also be successful, though the body of clinical experience is small. Local injection of methotrexate reduces the frequency of persistent ectopic pregnancy after linear salpingostomy. GTD: Methotrexate is a first choice for uncomplicated malignant trophoblastic disease. Resistance to methotrexate is encountered requiring the use of alternative drug regimens (see melphalan ). Prognostic factors useful for treatment decisions divide womeninto low-, medium-, and high-risk groups. Low-risk patients aretreated by a single agent, preferably methotrexate. Medium- to high-risk populations require multidrug regimens that frequently include methotrexate. Women should avoid pregnancy until their b-hCG titer is normal for 1y. Medical abortion: Methotrexate has been used to induce a medical abortion of an intrauterine pregnancy. It is more effectivecombined with misoprostol than alone. As it is not 100% effective, women must be followed clinically until there is complete normalization of b-hCG titers from their serum. Side effects include thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia (severe or Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether methotrexate crosses the human placenta. Methotrexate is rapidly taken up by the trophoblast in a fashion that does not interfere with folateuptake, and then extruded. It seems reasonable to conclude that1st trimester exposure results in an increased risk of internal and external malformations (craniofacial, axial skeletal, cardiopulmonary, GI and dermatologic abnormalities) anddevelopmental delay, though most pregnancies exposed to lowdoses are successful. The teratogenic effect is enhanced by the addition of misoprostil. Others report no association between later pregnancy exposure and congenital abnormalities. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. It is unknown whether methotrexate enters human breast milk. Despite the lack of information, methotrexate is generally considered contraindicated in nursing mothers. #Drug Interactions ................ Use of some NSAIDs with high-dose methotrexate has been reported to elevate and prolong serum methotrexate levels, resulting in deaths from severe hematologic and GI toxicity. Theyare contraindicated. Caution is indicated whenever NSAIDs andsalicylates are administered with lower doses of methotrexate. Despite the potential interactions, studies of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have usually includedconcurrent use of constant-dosage regimens of NSAIDs, withoutapparent problems. However, the doses used in rheumatoid arthritis (7.5-15mg/w) are somewhat lower than those used in psoriasis and larger doses could lead to unexpected toxicity.Toxicity may be increased by the displacement of methotrexate by certain drugs, such as phenylbutazone, phenytoin, salicylates, and sulfonamides. Renal tubular transport is also diminished byprobenecid.Oral antibiotics (e.g., chloramphenicol, tetracycline, nonabsorbable broad-spectrum antibiotics) may decrease intestinal absorption of methotrexate or interfere with the enterohepatic circulation by inhibiting bowel flora and suppressing metabolism of the drug by bacteria. Penicillins may reduce the renal clearance of methotrexate and increase serum concentrations with resultant hematologic and GI toxicity.May decrease the clearance of theophylline; theophylline levels should be monitored closely.Vitamin preparations containing folic acid or its derivatives may decrease the response to methotrexate. Folate deficiency states may increase toxicity. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been reported rarely to increase bone marrow suppression probably by an additive antifolate effect. #References Teratology 1999;60:10-2.el-Lamie 682Flam F, 17:2585-7. 2002; 9:464-7.

One to 6% of young women have chronic hypertension. Methyldopa is perhaps the best-studied antihypertensive agent during pregnancy. It remains a first-line agent for the treatmentof moderate to mild hypertension. Methyldopa requires 48-72h to exert its effect. The delay can be reduced to <12h if the patient is loaded either parenterally or orally. Hypertensionpredating pregnancy should be differentiated from preeclampsia. While treatment is indicated for women with a systolic BP >170mmHg and/or a diastolic BP >109mmHg, there is no consensus whether lesser degrees of hypertension requiretreatment during pregnancy. In women with mild to moderate chronic hypertension, antihypertensive therapy improves the 691maternal but apparently not the fetal outcome. In such patients, methyldopa prolongs pregnancy by some 10d compared to placebo, but does not decrease the prevalence of superimposedpreeclampsia. Methyldopa is less effective than metoprolol, but as effective as nifedipine, labetalol, andketanserin, in decreasing both systolic and diastolic BP in women with chronichypertension. On average, methyldopa decreases the maternal MAP 10.0mmHg and the mean heart rate by 6.0 bpm. Thehypotensive effect is associated with a decrease in sFH-1 and an increase in PIGF. The uterine artery pulsatility index is generally unchanged. One small cohort study of early antihypertensivetreatment with methyldopa in normotensive pregnant women with type 1 diabetes and microalbuminuria observed a significant reduction in preterm birth <34w. This finding needs prospective confirmation. Neither short- nor long-term use of methyldopa is associated with adverse maternal effects. Rare, sporadic cases of reactive hepatitis are reported in women treated with methyldopa during pregnancy. In chronically hypertensive women, methyldopa increases prolactin, thyrotropin, and T fashion, indicating decreased dopaminergic inhibition of pituitary hormone release. In contrast, methyldopa decreases plasma T 4levels. effects antihypertensive agents cross the placental barrier.Methyldopa is the only drug accepted for use during the 1st trimester of pregnancy. Neither short- nor long-term effects on the fetus or the neonate are reported after long-term methyldopa use.Methyldopa does not significantly alter fetal cardiac activity or produce any fetal hemodynamic changes as measured by Doppler flow studies. In contrast, methyldopa decreases placental vascular resistance in mild preeclampsia and in chronichypertension. The available data are inadequate to concludewhether methyldopa adversely affects the fetal or neonatal HR and pattern. Until such data are available, FHR changes cannot be reliably attributed to drug effect, but rather may be due to progression of the underlying maternal or placental disease.Longitudinal studies revealed no developmental disturbances at 3y in children exposed in utero.

Postpartum hemorrhage remains leading cause of maternal death and morbidity. Oxytocin, methylergonovine, and several prostaglandin agents are the pharmacologic agents most frequentlyused to prevent or treat postpartum hemorrhage. There is a longclinical experience with methylergonovine. It is effective and inexpensive. Unfortunately, its shelf life is compromised in tropical climates, where misoprostol may be preferable. Methylergonovine is typically administered in the immediate postpartum period when oxytocin alone fails to control myometrial atony. However, it is not effective prophylaxis for atony after delivery, and its administration with delivery of the anterior shoulder may actually increase the risk of a retained placenta. One RCT concludedoxytocin after delivery of the anterior shoulder was superior to methylergonovine administered after delivery of the placenta for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage.The half-life of methylergonovine is 1-3min, its onset of action 2-5min after IM and 5-10min after oral administration. IM is more effective than PO for the treatment of atony; the IV route is usually avoided unless the dose is diluted and infused slowly dueto potential hypertension (perhaps causing stroke or MI) orvascular/tissue damage due to extravasation. There are potential interactions of methylergonovine and vasoactive agents, which perhaps have been administered to treat hemorrhagic hypotension. Therefore, there must be communication between the obstetrician and anesthesiologist at an operative delivery with unexpected blood loss before the methylergonovine is given. The combination of oxytocin andmethylergonovine is more effective than oxytocin andmisoprostol with fewer side effects. Given late postpartum, methylergonovine accelerates involution but enhances maternal cramping. A combination of misoprostol and methylergonovine is an extremely efficient abortifacient in the 2nd trimester. Doses in excess of 2mg can be associated with hallucinations. Side effects include MI, N/V, diarrhea, headache, hallucinations, hypertension, chest pain, tinnitus, nasal congestion, hematuria, dyspnea, thrombophlebitis, and dizziness. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether methylergonovine crosses 695the human placenta. Rodent teratogenicity studies have not been performed. Inadvertent administration during pregnancy is followed by tetanic contractions and fetal bradycardia. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. The concentrations of methylergonovine in human breast milk are clinically insignificant. While some reports suggest methylergonovine may decrease milk production, it has been used for decades PO tid or qid up to 1w to prevent postpartum hemorrhage without adverse effects on either lactation or the newborn. #Drug Interactions ................ There are rare reports of serious adverse events associated with the use of certain ergot alkaloids (e.g., dihydroergotamine, ergotamine ) and potent CYP3A4 in vasospasm leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Although there are no reports of such interactions with methylergonovine alone, potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin, zileuton ) may be administered with caution. These examples are incomplete, and the prescriber should consider the effects on CYP3A4 of otheragents being considered for concomitant use with methylergonovine. #References .........................

Methylprednisolone is effective treatment for a wide range of disorders that occur during pregnancy. The large number prevents a detailed list here. Most synthetic corticosteroids are absorbed rapidly and completely when administered orally andare eliminated by the liver through the action of the enzyme CYP3A4. Smaller amounts are eliminated by the kidney (10-30%). The elimination t/2 is short (e.g., in nonpregnantadults, 2.3 \u00b1 0.5h); however, the biologic activity is much longer(12-36h). Methylprednisolone is effective and believed safe during pregnancy for the treatment of acute asthma, lupus,nephrotic syndrome with mixed connective tissue disease,immune glomerulonephritis, alloimmune inflammatory bowel palsy, and gestational herpes, and for a ''stress'' dose in labor and delivery to chronically suppressed patients, among many otheruses. Other inflammatory disorders such as de Quervain's diseaseof pregnancy can be treated successfully. It has been suggested that 1st trimester hyperemesis gravidarium refractory to conventional treatments can be treated with methylprednisolone. However, a recent RCT concluded that the addition of parenteral and oral methylprednisolone to the treatment of women with hyperemesis gravidarum did not reduce the need for rehospitalization later in pregnancy. Steroids may also be usefulin reducing the severity and speeding the recovery of women who develop atypical preeclampsia, or HELLP syndrome. Methylprednisolone reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation during ovulation induction for in vitro fertilization. Side effects include immunosuppression, edema, appetite change, skin changes, acne, cushingoid features, hyperglycemia, and ecchymosis. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Methylprednisolone does not cross the placenta. However, a recent RCT concluded that high-dose methylprednisolone reduces fetal exposure to hyperthermia and inflammation, but increases the rate of neonatal asymptomatic bacteremia. Stress-dose corticosteroid use in labor should trigger consideration of a screening neonatal blood culture. Rodentteratogenicity studies have not been performed, but there is no clinical evidence it is teratogenic. The effect of bolus doses of methylprednisolone on the fetus is unknown. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. It is unknown whether methylprednisolone enters human breast milk. What little evidence exists suggests the quantity of corticosteroid excreted into breast milk is notclinically relevant for the newborn. #Drug Interactions ................ Mutual inhibition of metabolism occurs with concurrent use ofcyclosporine andmethylprednisolone. Convulsions are reported with use of methylprednisolone andcyclosporine. Hepatic enzymes such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampin may increase the clearance of methylprednisolone and may require increases in methylprednisolone dose to achieve the desired response.Troleandomycin andketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of methylprednisolone and thus decrease its clearance. The dose of methylprednisolone should be titrated to avoid toxicity. 699May increase the clearance of chronic high-dose aspirin leading to decreased salicylate levels or increase the risk of toxicity when themethylprednisolone is withdrawn. The effect on oral anticoagulants is variable. There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of anticoagulant when given concurrently with corticosteroids. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored to maintain the desiredanticoagulant effect. #References .........................

N/V are common during the 1st trimester. Metoclopramide effectively reduces the incidence and severity, but may beassociated with an increased risk of preterm delivery. It is unclearwhether this relationship is related to metoclopramide or to the underlying disease. The insufficient data on the safety ofmetoclopramide makes it a second-line agent for the treatment of hyperemesis or gastroesophageal reflux. Metoclopramide is highly effective controlling N/V during surgery in women undergoing cesarean section. It reduces gastric secretions but does not decrease the quantity of narcotics used to control painpostoperatively. In contrast, metoclopramide significantly reduces the duration of labor and the total PCA morphine requirements of women undergoing prostaglandin-induced abortion. To reduce 703the risk of dystonia, patients may be premedicated with diphenhydramine. Metoclopramide is also helpful for the treatment of migraine, and enhances erythropoiesis in womenwith dizziness, hyperprolactinemia, urticaria, insomnia, headache, confusion, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Metoclopramide crosses the human placenta, though the kinetics remain to be elucidated. Its use in the 1st trimester does not appear to be associated with an increased riskof malformations, spontaneous abortions, or decreased fetal birth weight. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than thoseused clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Metoclopramide transfer was examined in 18 women who were 8-12w postpartum. It was detected in all samples, typically withan M:P ratio >1. However, metoclopramide was found in only 1 of the 5 neonates studied. Exposure of the child ranged from6-24 mcg/kg/day in the early puerperium to 1-13 mcg/kg/day inthe late puerperium. These quantities are considerably less thanthe therapeutic dose of 500 mcg/kg/day recommended for children. Metoclopramide is said to augment milk production without altering the prolactin or sodium concentrations. However, one RCT in women delivered prematurely concluded it does not improve breast milk volume or the duration of breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................

Serious arrhythmias can result. Corticosteroids or ACTH may increase the risk of hypokalemiaand increase salt and water retention.May increase serum lithium levels. Diuretic-induced hypokalemia may increase the neuromuscularblockade of curariform drugs (e.g., tubocurarine ). It may be advisable to discontinue metolazone 3d before elective surgery. Salicylates and other NSAIDs may decrease the antihypertensiveeffect.Methenamine efficacy may be decreased due to urinary alkalizing effect.

Metoprolol is effective for the treatment of mild to moderate chronic hypertension, stable angina, arrhythmia, and post-MI patients. Metoprolol was extensively tested during pregnancy and deemed safe. Its clearance is increased during pregnancy, and the dose may require upward revision each trimester.Metoprolol is more effective than methyldopa in decreasing both systolic and diastolic BP in women with chronichypertension, but less effective than nicardipine. There are many case reports of its use during pregnancy withoutapparent adverse effects. In principle, the management of an arrhythmia is similar whether the patient is pregnant or not. Metoprolol has been used successfully to correct supraventricular arrhythmias. It may also reduce the frequency of migraine headache during pregnancy when given prophylactically. Metoprolol is as effective as propranolol in controlling symptoms of hyperthyroidism.Side effects include bradycardia, CHF, bronchospasm, depression, blurred vision, decreased libido, and tinnitus. 707#Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Metoprolol crosses the human placenta, but does not adversely affect the FHR. Some studies of b-blockers in pregnancy reveal an increased risk of IUGR. While true withatenolol andpropranolol, it is not noted with metoprolol. Current study suggests the cause of IUGR is excessive bblockade, producing a decrease in maternal cardiac output. Rodent studiesare reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGRdespite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. High doses are associated with embryotoxicity. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Small quantities of metoprolol are excreted into human breast milk. The neonatal plasma level is either very low or undetectablebetween breastfeeding periods. Feeding 3-4h after the maternal dose further reduces the neonatal risk. #Drug Interactions ................ Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., MAOIs, reserpine may have an additive effect when given with b-blocking agents. Patients should be observed closely for hypotension or markedbradycardia, which may in turn produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Patients with a history of severe anaphylaxis to a variety ofallergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge while takingb-blockers. that inhibit CYP2D6 (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, propafenone, quinidine ) are likely to metoprolol levels. In healthy subjects with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizerphenotype, use of quinidine (100 mg) and metoprolol (200 mg) tripled the ( S-)metoprolol concentration and doubled the metoprolol elimination t/2. May exacerbate the rebound hypertension that can follow clonidine withdrawal. The b-blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine byb-blocker therapy, the introduction should be delayed until several days after the clonidine was stopped. #References considered safe during pregnancy and lactation for the noted indications and doses. 708Metronidazole \u2014(Flagyl) Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, England, France, Greece,Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Philippines,Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan); Metrolex (Thailand); Metronidazol McKesson (Costa Belgium, England, France, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, South Africa, Switzerland); Rozex Gel (Israel, Netherlands, bid 500mg PO bid /C27d, 1g PO bid /C21d (partner treatment is critical) NOTE: available also in gel (0.75%) or cream (0.75%). /C15Contraindications \u2014hypersensitivity to drug or class, consumption blood dyscrasia, seizures, neuropathies #Maternal Considerations ..... Metronidazole is used widely during pregnancy and has multiple therapeutic benefits. Bacterial vaginosis: BV is associated with preterm rupture of membrane, preterm labor and delivery, and postpartumendometritis. Systemic and local therapy with metronidazole effectively treats BV. Several large randomized trials seeking to determine whether successful treatment of BV reduced the prevalence of adverse outcomes ended in controversy. Womenwho deliver preterm with symptomatic BV have a lower risk ofpreterm birth in a subsequent pregnancy if treated with 709metronidazole. Unfortunately, the treatment of women with asymptomatic BV and no prior preterm birth apparently does not alter their preterm delivery rate. High-risk conditions that require treatment of BV with metronidazole include women with prior preterm birth, body mass index <19.8kg/m2, and evidence of endometritis before pregnancy. A ''test of cure'' should beobtained 1mo later. Small trials suggest that the combination ofampicillin andmetronidazole successfully prolongs pregnancy in women with threatened idiopathic preterm labor. Similar results are reported when metronidazole is combined with erythromycin. Unfortunately, an appropriately sized RCT comparing metronidazole plus ampicillin at 24w and intrapartum had no effect on preterm birth despite reducing theprevalence of BV. In several of the RCTs, women with asymptomatic BV who took metronidazole before 26w gestation actually had a higher incidence of preterm labor than controls.In another RCT focusing on women with a positive cervical fetal fibronectin in the 2nd trimester, metronidazole treatment was associated with a near doubling of the preterm birth rate compared to placebo. BV treatment may offer other benefits. Prophylactic IV metronidazole reduces infectious morbidity postoperatively after a clinically indicated cesarean section. Similar results are obtained when metronidazole is applied PV. Metronidazole also decreases the risk of upper genital tract infection after 1st trimester suction curettage.Trichomoniasis is associated with an increased incidence of adverse outcomes of pregnancy. A single dose of metronidazole cures 90%. The cure rate is higher if both partners are treated. Unfortunately, the treatment of pregnant women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis does not prevent preterm delivery. It is not knownwhether the result is different for symptomatic disease. Other diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, C. difficile colitis, and anaerobic and protozoal infections are successfully treated during pregnancy with short-term courses of metronidazole. Side effects include seizures, peripheral neuropathy, metallic taste, glossitis, Considerations ........... Metronidazole crosses the human placenta. Though achieving an F:M ratio near unity, it does not pose a major teratogenic riskwhen used in the recommended doses. The safety of drug therapyfor inflammatory bowel disease during pregnancy is an important clinical concern. Metronidazole appears safe if used for short durations. The possible fetal adverse effects related with long-term exposure as required by this condition remain unknown. Rodentstudies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. Embryotoxicity occurs. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Metronidazole is excreted into human breast milk, reaching an M:P ratio greater than unity, but is not associated with adverseeffects in breastfed neonates. #Drug Interactions ................ aprolongation of the that induce microsomal liver enzymes (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin ) may accelerate the elimination of metronidazole, 710resulting in reduced plasma levels; impaired clearance of phenytoin has also been reported. Drugs that decrease microsomal liver enzyme activity (e.g.,cimetidine ) may prolong the t/2 and decrease plasma clearance. Alcoholic beverages may cause abdominal cramps, N/V, headaches, and flushing. Psychotic reactions have been reported in alcoholic patients also taking disulfiram. Metronidazole should not be given to patients who have taken disulfiram within the last 2w. In patients stabilized on relatively high doses of lithium, short-term oralmetronidazole therapy has been associated with elevation of serum lithium levels and, in a few cases, lithium toxicity. #References .........................

Mezlocillin \u2014(Mezlin) International Considerations ..... Mezlocillin, alone or in combination with other antibiotics, is effective as treatment or prophylaxis for a variety of diseases during pregnancy, including pyelonephritis, puerperalendomyometritis, and PPROM, or for cesarean section prophylaxis. In several small trials, mezlocillin prolonged the latency interval after PPROM. Mezlocillin is considered as safe and effective as cefoxitin andclindamycin/gentamicin for treatment of postpartum endometritis. A single perioperative dose ofmezlocillin is as effective as a 3-dose regimen of either mezlocillin orcefoxitin in preventing postoperative endometritis after a cesarean section. Because there is no antibiotic that provides superior postcesarean prophylaxis, the decision is usually based on cost.Side effects include rash, pruritus, urticaria, drug fever, unpleasant taste, seizures, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 713hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, pseudomembranous colitis, elevated LFTs, and thrombophlebitis. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Mezlocillin crosses the placenta and is found in low concentrations in fetal blood and AF. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGRdespite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

Candida vaginitis is perhaps the most common female genital tract infection. The vaginal milieu during pregnancy predisposes toC. albicans overgrowth. There are no adequate reports or well- controlled studies of miconazole in pregnant women. There is controversy whether the various imidazole compounds differ in efficacy for mycotic vaginitis. Studies conducted immediately after miconazole was released suggested it was significantly better than nystatin, clotrimazole, andbutoconazole for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis during gestation. However, no RCTsubstantiates that conclusion. There is no significant difference in cure rates achieved after 7-14d of therapy. Significantly morepatients relapsed after cure in the nystatin andclotrimazole groups than in the miconazole groups. Miconazole is as effective 715as oral therapy with fluconazole for vulvovaginal candidiasis. About 25-30% of the oral dose, but less than 0.1% of the vaginal dose, is absorbed. Though women frequently prefer oral medication, fluconazole is not recommended during pregnancy. Side effects include anaphylaxis, thrombocytopenia, cardiac arrest, vulvovaginal burning, itching, hives, rash, irritation, phlebitis, pruritus, N/V, fever, drowsiness, diarrhea,anorexia, and flushing. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether miconazole crosses the human placenta, but it has been used successfully in newborns.In vitro, miconazole effectively inhibits placental and fetal adrenal steroid aromatase. Miconazole is absorbed systemically after vaginal application, reaching peak levels approximating 10ng/ml.In contrast, parenteral levels of miconazole exceed mcg/ml. Post- marketing studies are reassuring, revealing no excess rates of adverse outcomes. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doseshigher than those used clinically. Embryotoxicity is associated with doses that also produce maternal toxicity. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether miconazole enters human breast milk. However, considering the dose and route, it is unlikely thebreastfed neonate of a woman being treated for vaginitis withvaginal applications would ingest clinically relevant amounts. #Drug Interactions ................ Drugs containing cremophor-type vehicles are known to causeelectrophoretic abnormalities of lipoprotein; for example, thevalues and/or patterns may be altered. These effects are reversible upon discontinuation but are not typically an indication for discontinuation.Enhancement of anticoagulant drugs may occur with coumarin.In cases of simultaneous treatment with miconazole IV and anticoagulant drugs, the anticoagulant effect should be carefullytitrated.Severe hypoglycemia has been reported when oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic agents are used together. The use of miconazole IV and rifampin should be avoided since the combination lowers the achieved levels of ketoconazole. Ketoconazole increases the blood level of cyclosporine; thus, there is a possibility of a similar drug interaction with miconazole IV. Blood levels of cyclosporine should be monitored if the two drugs are used together.Use with CNS-active drugs (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin ) may alter the metabolism of one or both drugs. It is not known whethermiconazole may affect the metabolism of other CNS-active drugs. #References BR, Murry BA. Steroids 1987; 50:179-89. McNellis D, McLeod M, Lawson J, Pasquale SA.

Outpatient surgery demands rapid recovery with minimal delay. The short-acting sedation of midazolam makes it one of the most frequently used benzodiazepines for short surgical procedures.It is most appropriate for those who are particularly anxious.Conscious sedation with midazolam andfentanyl significantly improves patient satisfaction with 1st trimester terminationperformed under local anesthesia. Similar results are obtained inwomen undergoing outpatient procedures such as oocyte retrievalprocedure or GIFT. one RCT, intrathecal midazolam (2mg) the postcesarean analgesia when adjunct tobupivacaine. In yet another RCT, intrathecal midazolam increased the analgesic effect of fentanyl without any increase in adverse outcomes. In addition, both the 1 and 2mg doses decreased postoperative N/V. In another double-blind RCT, healthy women received either a combination of 1mcg/kgfentanyl and 0.02mg/kg midazolam IV, or an equal volume of saline IV at the time of their skin preparation for a bupivacaine spinal anesthetic. Fetal outcome measures included Apgar scores,continuous pulse oximetry for 3h, and neurobehavioral scores.Maternal outcomes included catecholamine levels, and recall of anesthesia and delivery. There were no between-group differences of neonatal outcome variables (Apgar score, neurobehavioralscores, continuous oxygen saturation). Mothers in both groupsshowed no difference in their ability to recall the birth of their babies. Midazolam levels are increased during pregnancy suggesting a decrease in CYP3A4 activity. In rodents, midazolam suppresses uterine contractility in vitro . 717Side effects include respiratory and/or cardiac arrest, withdrawal, habituation, N/V, confusion, euphoria, involuntary movements, hypotension, sedation, agitation, retrograde amnesia, hallucinations, marked aggressiveness, taste, dry mouth, and constipation. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Midazolam crosses the human placenta somewhat more slowly than diazepam, achieving an F:M concentration ratio approaching unity 30-60min after maternal injection. Postnatally,its elimination t/2 is 6-7h. The reported effects of benzodiazepineson development are inconsistent. Studies in the 1970s suggested1st trimester exposure to benzodiazepines increased the risk of facial clefts, cardiac malformations, and other multiple malformations. Yet, no syndrome could be described. Diazepam andchlordiazepoxide were most frequently implicated. However, an increased risk was not confirmed in recent studies. Midazolam use during the 3rd trimester or labor may be associated withfloppy infant syndrome, or symptoms of neonatal withdrawal.These symptoms vary among mild sedation, hypotonia, apneic spells, cyanosis, impaired metabolic responses to cold stress, and reluctance to suck, and may persist for hours to months after birth. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Midazolam is excreted at low concentrations into human breast milk with an M:P ratio approximating 0.15 and less than 0.05%of the maternal dose in 24h. Considering the dose and route, it isunlikely the breastfed neonate would ingest clinically relevantamounts. #Drug Interactions ................ Sedative effect of midazolam is accentuated by any concomitantly administered medication that depresses the CNS, particularly narcotics (e.g., The dose of midazolam should be adjusted accordingly. Caution is advised with drugs known to inhibit CYP3A4, result in prolonged sedation due to decreased midazolam clearance. In a placebo-controlled study, erythromycin administered 500mg tid for 1w reduced themidazolam clearance and doubled the t/2. The effects of diltiazem (60mg tid) and verapamil (80mg tid) on the pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics of midazolam were investigated in a 3-way crossover study. The t/2 of midazolam increased from 5 to 7h when either drug was taken. Saquinavir may reduce the midazolam clearance by up to (e.g., carbamazepine, C maxand AUC of oralmidazolam in adult studies. Phenobarbital is expected to have the same effect. A 15% decrease in thiopental requirements has been noted following use of IM midazolam for premedication. IVmidazolam decreases the MAC of halothane required for general anesthesia.In neonates, severe hypotension has been reported with concomitant administration of fentanyl. This effect has been observed in neonates on an infusion of midazolam who received a rapid injection of fentanyl and in patients on an infusion of fentanyl who have received a rapid injection of midazolam. #References .........................

Mifepristone causes progesterone withdrawal. It is a possible emergency contraceptive afterunprotected coitus (10mg) effective for up to 6d (either 25mg levonorgestrel 1.5mg PO 12h later) is 80% effective. In 1996, the FDA Advisory Committee forReproductive Health Drugs concluded mifepristone was safe and effective for early pregnancy termination. In 2000, theFDA approved mifepristone to induce abortion in pregnancies <49d from the LMP. The most popular treatment schedule is mifepristone 200-600mg followed 36-48h later by oral misoprostol (0.4-0.6mg) in to 49d, and vaginal gemeprost (1.0mg) or misoprostol (0.8mg) if the pregnancy dates from 49 to 63d since the LMP. The addition of 2 doses of misoprostol beginning 48h after mifepristone significantly reduces the ongoing pregnancy rate compared to mifepristone alone. In another report, a fixed protocol of 200mg of mifepristone PO followed by 0.4mg misoprostol PV 2d later was compared to a flexible dosing interval of 1, 2, or 3d betweenmifepristone andmisoprostol. At the same time, the upper limit of gestational age was increased from 56 to 63 days. The rates of complete abortion were 94.9% and 94.4% (not significant), respectively. Continuing pregnancy was rare (0.7%). b-hCG and progesterone concentrations continue to increase for 48h after mifepristone. After misoprostol, theb-hCG and progesterone levels decline in 24h by 70% and 60%, respectively. Treatedwomen should expect some bleeding for 9-16d. Eight percent oftreated women bleed 30d or more. The duration of bleedingincreases with gestational age at termination. There are only a few randomized studies comparing medical and surgical termination, and the definitions of successful outcome (complete abortion),adverse effects, and complications vary. The three most common reasons a woman chooses a medical abortion are ''avoidance of surgery,'' ''avoidance of general anesthesia,'' and ''the methodbeing more natural.'' The duration of bleeding, degree of bloodloss, and frequency of uterine pain, vomiting, and diarrhea are all greater with mifepristone abortion. Conversely, the incidence of major complications such as blood transfusion and pelvic infection does not seemingly differ between the two. Surgicalcomplications, such as uterine perforation and cervical tears, are less common in women who choose medical abortion. Mifepristone helps preserve fertility and avoid major maternal complications (death, hysterectomy) in women with eithercervical or uterine scar ectopic pregnancy. At term, mifepristone has a modest impact on cervical ripening if given 24h beforelabor induction. Mifepristone appears to reduce the need for misoprostol andoxytocin compared with placebo. Side effects include vaginal bleeding, abdominal cramps, incomplete abortion, fetal malformation, hemorrhage, N/V,anxiety, fever, rigors, dyspepsia, fainting, vaginitis, asthenia,leukorrhea, and insomnia. 721#Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Mifepristone does cross the primate placenta. The human experience with continued pregnancy after failed medicaltermination is limited. Normal outcomes are reported. WhileMo\u00a8bius' syndrome is increased after failed misoprostol termination, the same cannot be said for mifepristone. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. It is unknown whether mifepristone enters human breast milk. Rodent studies suggest that mifepristone enhances lactation. #Drug Interactions ................ Mifepristone is a substrate for CYP3A4. It is possible that CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, grapefruit juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole ) may inhibit its metabolism increase level. Furthermore, CYP3A4 inducers may increase mifepristone metabolism and lower its serum levels. Use of mifepristone may lead to an increase in serum levels of other drugs that are CYP 3A4 substrates. Due to the slowelimination of mifepristone, such interaction may be observed for a prolonged period after administration. Caution is advised. #References .........................

Depression is common during and after pregnancy, but typically goes unrecognized. Pregnancy is not a reason a priori to discontinue psychotropic drugs. Mirtazapine is one option for patients unresponsive to or intolerant of SSRIs. Most of thepublished experience with mirtazapine during pregnancy is limited to small case series and epidemiologic surveys.Side effects include agranulocytosis, orthostatic hypotension, torsades appetite, weight gain,hypercholesterolemia, dry mouth, somnolence, dyspnea, confusion, tremor, abnormal thinking, flu-like symptoms, elevated back pain. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether mirtazapine crosses the human placenta. Based on reports from Teratogen InformationServices, mirtazapine does not appear to increase the baseline rate of major malformations of 1-3%. However, there is anincrease in spontaneous losses similar to that reported for other antidepressants. Further, there is a single case report of recurrent neonatal hypothermia through 10d of life. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Mirtazapine enters human breast milk. Mean relative infant doses formirtazapine and desmethylmirtazapine were 1.5% and 0.4%, respectively. The mean M:P ratio was 1.1 for mirtazapine and 0.6 for desmethylmirtazapine. Mirtazapine was detected (1.5mcg/L) in only 1 of 4 infants tested. #Drug Interactions ................ Mirtazapine is a substrate for several CYP enzymes, including CYP2D6, 1A2, and 3A4. In vitro studies suggest mirtazapine is not a potent inhibitor of these enzymes, an indication that it isnot likely to have a clinically significant inhibitory effect on themetabolism of other drugs that are substrates for these enzymes.Impairment of cognitive and motor skills is additive to that produced by ethanol and diazepam. #References .........................

Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E analog. The only FDA-approved indication is the treatment and prevention of intestinal ulcerdisease resulting from NSAID drug use. Although still not approved by the FDA for other indications, misoprostol is well studied and widely used for both cervical ripening and the induction of labor during either the 2nd or 3rd trimesters. The route of administration is relevant. At 2min after 600mcg PO in postpartum women, the plasma level is 91.5pg/ml; it peaks at20min (344pg/ml), and then falls steeply by 120min (27.8pg/ml).Misoprostol administered PR generates lower peak levels and a reduction in the prevalence of adverse effects compared with oraldrug. The AUC for rectal misoprostol is higher by 121pg/h/ml than oral drug; the mean maximum serum concentration is alsosignificantly lower and occurs >20min later than it does for oral drug. Women reported shivering after administration: 76% after600mcg PO, 56% after 400mcg PR, and 54% after 600mcg PR.The relative risk of shivering in both PR groups is 25% lower than in the PO group. Severe shivering is reduced by 70% in PR groups. Increasing rectal doses may achieve higher efficacywithout reducing the acceptability of the treatment.Early to mid-pregnancy termination: Combined with mifepristone, misoprostol is safe and effective for medical termination of early pregnancy. Typically, misoprostol is given PV 48h after mifepristone. The administration of either 2 doses of misoprostol (400mcg) or one dose (800mcg) after mifepristone significantly reduces the risk of failed abortion compared tomifepristone alone. Vaginal misoprostol shortens the time from induction to delivery compared to PO. A wide range of dosing regimens has been suggested for 2nd trimester termination; 400mcg PV q4-6h are common. the induction Misoprostol does not reduce the blood loss and the time for placentalexpulsion after 2nd trimester termination.Term pregnancy: Misoprostol is commonly used to induce cervical ripening and labor. In August 2000, the manufacturerissued a warning letter to American health care providerscautioning against the use of misoprostol in pregnant women secondary to the lack of safety data for its use in obstetric practice. The ACOG took issue with that position, as there were a multitude of studies supporting its use. Misoprostol is effective in ripening the cervix and inducing labor at term when given either PV or PO. It is inexpensive and stable at room temperature. Debate continues on the optimal dose, regimen, route ofadministration, and concurrent use of ancillary ripening methods(laminaria, Foley balloon, dinoprostone gel). Low-dose misoprostol (25mcg) is effective for cervical ripening and labor 730induction. More recently, a single 25mcg outpatient intravaginal dose of misoprostol was reported to be effective in decreasing the interval to delivery in women with unfavorable cervices at term.The study, however, was inadequately powered to provide strongcomment on safety. Uterine tachysystole is more common after 50mcg or more given vaginally or orally. Clinical trials report increased frequencies of meconium passage, neonatal acidemia,and cesarean delivery due to fetal distress if high doses are used.Some trials report no decrease in the overall rate of cesarean delivery, though the frequency of failed induction as an indication is reduced. Misoprostol is effective for the induction of labor in women with PPROM, intrauterine fetal demise, orpreeclampsia. A recent randomized trial compared dinoprostone tomisoprostol for the induction of labor in women at high risk for fetal distress. Misoprostol anddinoprostone proved equally safe for the induction of labor. However, misoprostol was more efficient and significantly cheaper. Parity, initial cervical dilation, and gestational age are the most useful predictors of successful cervical ripening and labor induction if administered PV. Themost common side effects during labor induction are shivering and uterine tachysystole. Because of the tachysystole, low-dose oxytocin may be preferred in the high-risk parturient whose fetus is at increased risk for fetal intolerance to labor. In 2002, theACOG Committee Opinion on Obstetric Practice concluded the risk of uterine rupture during VBAC is substantially increased by the use of various prostaglandin cervical ripening agents. They arespecifically discouraged in favor of mechanical methods. Rectalmisoprostol (400mcg) may be similar to oxytocin (10IU with the anterior shoulder), while either rectal or oral misoprostol are significantly less effective than oxytocin plus methylergonovine for the prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. Misoprostol (800mcg) dissolved in 30ml saline and administered by intraumbilical injection appears to reduce the need for manual removal of a retained adherent placenta, whereas oxytocin effectiveness was similar to the injection of saline alone. Side effects include abortion, uterine rupture, uterine hyperstimulation, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal ........... adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. Misoprostol is associated with a higher rate of uterine hyperstimulation, more variable decelerations, and likely as a result,a higher prevalence of meconium. However, compared to oxytocin, there is no increase in the incidence of cesarean section for fetaldistress or umbilical acidemia. A recent meta-analysis concluded there was no difference in the frequencies of uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes whether misoprostol was given PO or intravaginally. Misoprostol is not embryotoxic or teratogenic in rodents at doses 625 /C2and 63 /C2the MRHD, respectively. Congenital defects after unsuccessful medical abortions arereported, but a mechanism has yet to be demonstrated. Severalreports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the 1st trimester with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects. In rodents, prostaglandins but not oxytocin stimulate intestinal smooth muscle. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Orally administered misoprostol is secreted in colostrum within 1h, but it is undetectable by 5h. The AUC is only51.4pg/h/ml, or 1=6of the maternal AUC. It has not been studied in women with established lactation. Though misoprostil is 731rapidly metabolized, there is no information on whether its active metabolite is excreted. #Drug Interactions ................

A single dose of triazolam (0.125mg) was also administered on the same days as those for the plasma sampling for ethinyl estradiol pharmacokinetics. The mean C maxand AUC(0-8) of triazolam decreased by 42% and 59%, respectively, and its eliminationt/2 was decreased by approximately 1h after the modafinil. May enhance the clearance of cyclosporine. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that modafinil reversibly inhibits CYP2C19 at CYP2C19 potency, by a circulating metabolite, modafinil sulfone. Although the maximum plasma concentrations of modafinil sulfone are much lower than those of the parent, thecombined effect of both could produce sustained partialinhibition of the enzyme. Drugs that are largely eliminated via CYP2C19 metabolism, such as diazepam, propranolol, phenytoin (also via CYP2C9), or ( S-)mephenytoin, may have prolonged elimination upon co-administration and may require a dose reduction. CYP2C19 also provides an ancillary pathway for the metabolism of certain TCAs (e.g., clomipramine, desipramine ) that are primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. In deficient in CYP2D6 (i.e., ''poor metabolizers'' of debrisoquine; 7-10% of the Caucasian population; similar or lower in otherpopulations), the amount metabolized by CYP2C19 may besubstantially increased. Modafinil may cause elevation of the levels of the TCAs in this subset of patients.Use of potent inducers of alter the plasma levels should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if the benefit justifies the potential perinatal idiopathic angioedema, vascular disease, renal dysfunction, hypotension #Maternal Considerations .....

Morphine is one of the most frequently used opioids for pain control during human parturition. The elimination t/2 ofmorphine is shorter and the plasma clearance quicker in parturients than in nonpregnant women. Morphine as part of an epidural or PCA regimen is common. It is also administered intrathecally after cesarean section for relief of postoperative pain for the first 48h. XR epidural morphine provides and prolonged postcesarean analgesia compared to conventional epidural morphine with no significant increases in adverse events. The addition of small dose to the spinal component of thecontinuous spinal epidural improves the effectiveness of epidurallabor analgesia and reduces the need for pain medications over24h, but results in a small increase in nausea. Epidural morphine significantly reduces the incidence of headache and the need for ablood patch after dural puncture. There is a long clinicalexperience supporting the relative safety of morphine for the listed indications. The combination of small doses of opioids and bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia eliminates intraoperative discomfort and reduces postoperative analgesic requirements in women undergoing either vaginal or cesarean delivery. The two most frequently used agents are fentanyl andmorphine. The intrathecal injection of effect of bupivacaine spinal anesthesia for cesarean section patients. PCA, which provides pain relief through 741self-administration of IV doses of opioids, is widely available and advocated as an effective analgesic modality. Morphine PCA offers a good quality of analgesia with minimal side effects duringboth the ante- and postnatal periods. Morphine does not affect the spontaneous contractility in vitro of human myometrium. It is one of the most frequently used opioids to achieve pain reliefduring an ambulatory surgical procedure. Patients receivingmorphine anddiazepam are to be cautioned against operating machinery or driving. Side effects include addiction, seizures, respiratory depression, hypotension, shock, apnea, cardiac arrest, bradycardia, toxic ........... Morphine readily crosses the term human placenta. Rapid maternal clearance shortens the fetal exposure. The concentrationof free morphine in umbilical venous blood after delivery is significantly associated with the dose-delivery interval and has a significant effect on the need for neonatal resuscitation. Alterations in fetal biophysical profile parameters such as fetal breathing movements and fetal heart rhythm should be expectedasmorphine decreases fetal heart variability and breathing frequency. It is not clear whether morphine decreases gross or fine fetal movements. Placental retention of morphine may prolong fetal exposure, explaining at least in part its prolongedeffect on fetal behavior relative to the maternal concentration.Morphine has been combined with benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) for the relief of pain and anxiety during fetal surgicalprocedures. While there is no evidence morphine is a human teratogen, uncontrolled retrospective studies of neonates chronically exposed to other opioids note reduced brain volume at birth that normalizes during the 1st month of life. Infants bornto opioid-abusing mothers are more often SGA, and havedecreased ventilatory responses to CO 2and increased risk SIDS. Neonatal abstinence syndrome due to opiate withdrawalproduces sleep/wake abnormalities, feeding difficulties, weightloss, and seizures. Rodent teratogen studies have not beenperformed. Other rodent studies suggest in utero exposure causes long-term alterations in adult brain and behavior. These changesaffect both the NE and opioid systems of several brain areas,including those involved in memory, stress responses, and the maintenance of homeostatic balance with the external environment. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Morphine is excreted in human breast milk, and the M:P AUC ratio after parenteral administration approximates 2.5:1. Theamount taken by the neonate depends on the maternal plasmaconcentration, quantity of milk ingested, and the extent of first-pass metabolism. In general, morphine is preferred to meperidine in breastfeeding women. Intrathecal morphine is not associated with clinically relevant maternal plasma and milkmorphine concentrations. The colostrum concentration of morphine and its active metabolites in women using PCA after cesarean delivery is small, supporting the safety of breastfeedingin mothers using a morphine PCA. #Drug Interactions ................ The of morphine 1:200,000) increases peak serum concentrations of morphine. Increasing the interval between drugs to at least 15min minimizes this interaction. 742The concurrent use of other CNS depressants, including sedatives, hypnotics, general anesthetics, droperidol, phenothiazines or other tranquilizers, and ethanol, increases the risk of respiratorydepression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma. Whencombined therapy is contemplated, the initial dose of one or both agents should be reduced at least 50%. MAOIs markedly potentiate the action of morphine, which should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14d ofstopping treatment. Respiratory depression may delay recovery of spontaneous pulmonary ventilation when neuromuscular blocking agents arealso used.There is an isolated report of confusion and severe respiratory depression when a hemodialysis patient was given both morphine andcimetidine. May reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. May lead to acute urinary retention by causing spasm of the bladder sphincter.Sustained-release capsules should be swallowed whole and not chewed, crushed, or dissolved due to risk of overdose. #References .........................

Its potency is essentially equivalent to morphine on a milligram basis. Nalbuphine acts within minutes after IV administration, and <15min after SC or IM injection; the duration of analgesia ranges from 3 to 6h. There are no well-controlled studies of nalbuphine in pregnant women. It is, however, a popular agent for analgesia during labor, comparable tomeperidine. Concerns for fetal safety were raised by a pharmaceutical company that no longer manufactures nalbuphine (see http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2005/aug_PI/ Nubain_PI.pdf ). There is insufficient information to support these concerns or to recommend any change in the administration of this medication for analgesia in labor. Due to its ability to bind the same opiate receptor as morphine, IVnalbuphine is sometimes used for the treatment of intrathecal morphine - induced pruritus after cesarean delivery.Side effects include headache, nervousness, depression, restlessness, crying, feeling of floating, hostility, unusual dreams, confusion, euphoria, faintness, hallucinations, dysphoria, feelingof heaviness, numbness, tingling, dizziness, bradycardia, hypotension, depression, dyspepsia, N/V, sweating, dry mouth, urticaria, cramps, dyspnea, asthma, bitter taste, speechdifficulty, urinary urgency, blurred vision, pruritus, and substanceabuse. #Fetal Considerations ...........

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common during pregnancy. Perhaps 1=3of affected pregnant women will develop symptomatic disease (hemorrhagic cystitis or pyelonephritis).

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Nalidixic acid crosses the human placenta, though the kinetics remain to be elucidated. Rodent and canine teratogenicity studies reveal the older quinolones such asnalidixic acid, flumequine, and pipemidic acid are associated with acute arthropathy of the weight-bearing joints. Althougharthropathy is rare in adult humans, toxicity was observed inimmature animals, leading to the restricted use of these agentsduring pregnancy. More recent studies conclude that nalidixic acid is not associated with any increased risks of spontaneous abortion, prematurity, IUGR, or postnatal disorders. A smallincrease in the risk pyloric stenosis cannot be excluded. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Nalidixic acid is excreted into human breast milk. However, the nursing newborn would ingest <0.05% of the maternal dose. #Drug Interactions ................ Nitrofurantoin interferes with the therapeutic action of nalidixic acid.Cross-resistance has been observed only with oxolinic acid.May enhance oral anticoagulants by displacing significant amounts from serum albumin binding sites.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether naloxone crosses the human placenta. Naloxone does not alter the placental transfer or clearance of morphine in humans. Neonates of women given parenteral opioids in labor that require naloxone have lower 1min Apgar scores than neonates whose mothers have epidural analgesia. Physicians practicing in community vs. university hospitals use naloxone more often to resuscitate the neonate. It is unclear whether this increased use reflects adherence to the American Academy of Pediatrics' guidelines for resuscitation, or whether the neonates delivered in community hospitals requireresuscitation more frequently. Either way, it is clear this practiceis poorly supported and should be examined. Porcine studies suggest that increased opioid ''tonus'' lowers the FHR and decreases fetal movement. Naloxone antagonizes the inhibitory effect of morphine on fetal heart rhythm and stimulates fetal hypermotility.

NSAIDs are widely distributed in OTC preparations, and theiruse during pregnancy is underestimated. About 5% of women report use of either ibuprofen ornaproxen near conception or during pregnancy. It may be combined with sumatriptan for the treatment of acute migraine. In a recent prospective case-control study, prenatal ibuprofen ornaproxen use increased the risk of spontaneous abortion by 80% (adjusted hazard ratio 1.8 [95% CI1.0-3.2]). The association was stronger if the initial use wasaround conception or if the use lasted more than 1w. Naproxen offers no distinct clinical advantage after the 1st trimester over other NSAIDs on the market. It provides analgesic relief similar toacetaminophen after vaginal delivery. One randomized trial suggests the addition of regular doses of naproxen to prn requests for acetaminophen-codeine provides small reductions in 759pain on day 2 after cesarean delivery, with the greatest effects at 36h, when pain typically peaks. Side effects include headache, dyspnea, dizziness, drowsiness, ........... Naproxen crosses the human placenta, achieving an F:M ratio of 0.92 during the 2nd trimester. Fetal levels are dependent on thematernal, as NSAIDs are not metabolized by the fetal kidney. Other NSAIDs can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. While the ductal response to naproxen remains to be studied, there are several case reports of neonatal pulmonaryhypertension after its use in the 3rd trimester. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Although naproxen is excreted into human breast milk, the amount of drug transferred is only a small fraction of thematernal dose and should not pose a risk to the nursingnewborn. #Drug Interactions ................ Displaced from its binding sites by aspirin , resulting in lower plasma concentrations and peak plasma levels.NSAIDs reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACEIs.NSAIDs may reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides. This response is attributed to inhibition of renalprostaglandin synthesis.Increases the minimum lithium concentration some 15% and decreases renal clearance some 20%, presumably secondary to the inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Patients should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic. Caution is advised even though no significant interactions have been observed in clinical studies with naproxen and coumarin-type anticoagulants. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of b-blockers. Probenecid increases plasma levels and extends the t/2 significantly.Use of naproxen delayed-release tablets are not recommended with H 2blockers, sucralfate, or intensive antacid therapy due to the increase in gastric pH. #References .........................

Nefazodone \u2014(Serzone) International use /C15Caution \u2014unknown #Maternal Considerations ..... Depression is common during and after pregnancy, but typically goes unrecognized. Pregnancy is not a reason a priori to discontinue psychotropic drugs. The serotonin reuptake inhibitors are first-line treatment for most depressive and anxiety disorders. Nefazodone is unrelated to SSRIs, TCAs, or MAOIs. There is limited published experience with nefazodone during pregnancy. It has been used to treat postpartum depression. Side effects include hepatotoxicity, seizures, hypomania, hepatic failure, asthenia, dizziness, light-headedness, headache,dry dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhea, pharyngitis,abnormal vision, blurred vision, confusion, orthostatichypotension, increased appetite, and paresthesias. #Fetal Considerations ........... There is no published experience in human fetuses. It is unknownwhether nefazodone crosses the human placenta. A prospective case-control study was reassuring, revealing no evidence of anadverse fetal effect. Rodent studies are generally reassuring,revealing no signs of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use ofdoses higher than those used clinically. There is an unexplained increase in early pup death. 764#Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. Nefazodone enters human breast milk, and neonatal drowsiness, lethargy, and poor feeding that resolveswhen breastfeeding stops are reported. If the mother elects tobreastfeed, the infant should be monitored for possible adverse effects, the drug given at the lowest effective dose, and breastfeeding avoided at times of peak drug levels. #Drug Interactions ................ Use with another drug that is highly protein bound may cause increased free concentrations of that drug, potentially resulting in adverse events. Conversely, adverse effects could result fromdisplacement of nefazodone by other highly bound drugs. In one steady-state pharmacokinetics study of healthy volunteers, nefazodone (250mg bid) triggered a marked increase in the buspirone concentration (up to 20-fold in C maxand up to 50- fold in AUC). Subjects receiving bid) (5mg bid) experienced light-headedness, asthenia, dizziness, and somnolence. These events were also noted with either drug alone.There were no changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters for fluoxetine qd) and nefazodone (200mg bid) were given. Nor were there changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of nefazodone. However, the mean AUC levels of the two biologically activenefazodone metabolites increased 3- to 6-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively. When administered to subjects receiving fluoxetine for 1w, there was an increased prevalence of transient adverse events such as headache, light-headedness, nausea, or paresthesia. Patients who are switched from fluoxetine tonefazodone without an adequate washout period can experience similar transient adverse events. Because of the long t/2 of fluoxetine and its metabolites, this washout period may range from 1 to severalweeks.Use carbamazepine the steady-state C of nefazodone by 86% and 93%, respectively. As a result, it is recommended nefazodone not be used in combination with carbamazepine . When given to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, the C and AUC for increased by 29%, 27%, and 15%, respectively. Digoxin had no effects on the pharmacokinetics of nefazodone and its active metabolites. Caution should be exercised when nefazodone anddigoxin are used together. Use with propranolol (40mg bid) by 30% and 14% propranolol, respectively. The kinetics of nefazodone and its metabolites were unaffected. No change in dosing of either drug is necessary. Caution should be used if nefazodone is given with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized CYP3A4 (e.g., atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin ). Increases of 20-fold in the concentrations of simvastatin and 3- to 4-fold in those of atorvastatin are presumably due to the inhibition of CYP3A4 by nefazodone as, in the same study, nefazodone had no effect on the plasma concentrations of pravastatin, which is not metabolized by CYP3A4. There are rare reports ofrhabdomyolysis in patients receiving the combination ofnefazodone and either simvastatin orlovastatin, also a substrate of CYP3A4. Since metabolic interactions are unlikely between nefazodone and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that undergo 765little by CYP3A4 (e.g., fluvastatin , pravastatin ), dosage adjustments should not be necessary. There are reports of increased concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus into toxic ranges when patients received these drugs with nefazodone. Both cyclosporine andtacrolimus are substrates of CYP3A4. Blood concentrations of the immunosuppressive agent should be monitored and dosageadjusted accordingly. #References .........................

Nelfinavir HIV infection\u20141250mg with food bid in combination with other antiretroviral agents; alternatively, 750mg PO tid NOTE: do not mix with juice or acidic food./C15Contraindications \u2014hypersensitivity to drug The incidence of both the AIDS syndrome and opportunistic infections has declined over the last few years due to advances indrug regimens. HAART consisting of 3-5 agents is the current standard of care in the US for the management of HIV infection during pregnancy because of its high efficacy. Some studyprotocols use nelfinavir as the protease inhibitor. The treatment of HIV during pregnancy dramatically reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission in proportion to the maternal viral load. Pregnancy increases clearance. In one steady-state study of20 women on a HAART regimen including nelfinavir (1250mg bid) and two NRTIs, during the 3rd trimester median nelfinavir AUC (0-12 h) was 25.8mcg/h/ml vs. 32.5mcg/h/ml in the controlgroup. Median oral clearance (CL/F) was significantly higher inpregnant women (48.5 L/h vs. 38.5 L/h), but the difference disappeared when CL/F was adjusted for body weight. Trough concentration was also significantly (p <.01) lower during 766pregnancy (median 0.8mcg/ml vs. 1.5mcg/ml). The elimination t/2 of nelfinavir during pregnancy was 3.7h (range 1.4-6.6h), compared with 5.2h (range 3.1-10.1h) in the control group.A smaller study led to a similar conclusion. These results indicatethat women in the later stages of pregnancy may be exposed to subtherapeutic concentrations of nelfinavir if the dosage or frequency is not adjusted. This increased clearance takes some time to return to the prepregnant values. In one study of 9pregnant women, clearance was unaltered compared to the puerperium. Careful monitoring for hepatotoxicity during therapy with nelfinavir is recommended. The association between combination antiviral therapy with protease inhibitors and anincreased risk of very low birth weight requires confirmation. Nelfinavir -related GI symptoms and hyperglycemia may be more common during pregnancy. Side effects include N/V, flatulence, diarrhea, hepatitis, seizures, are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Like most protease inhibitors, nelfinavir crosses the human placenta but achieves only subtherapeutic levels.In one study, the nelfinavir F:M concentration ratio was 25% for maternal concentrations of 0.1-2.5mg/L between 31 and 41wgestation. In another study, cord blood concentrations werebelow the limit of assay detection in 10 of 40 samples fornelfinavir and 10 of 16 AF samples. The transfer is probably limited by a high degree of plasma protein binding andbackward transport by placental P-glycoprotein. Rodent studiesare reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Nelfinavir enters human breast milk, but the M:P ratio ranges from 6% to 24%. Breastfeeding is contraindicated in HIV-infected nursing women where formula is available to reduce the risk of neonatal transmission. #Drug Interactions ................ Inhibits CYP3A. Use with drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A channel blockers, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, immunosuppressants, sildenafil ) may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other drug that could increase or prolong both its therapeutic and adverse effects. Lovastatin andsimvastatin have the potential for serious reactions such as risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.Increases atorvastatin concentration; use the lowest possible dose ofatorvastatin with careful monitoring, or consider another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (e.g., fluvastatin, pravastatin ). Rifampin loss of antivirologic efficacy and resistance tonelfinavir or to other co-administered antiretroviral agents. St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may lead to loss of antivirologic efficacy and resistance to nelfinavir or to other co-administered antiretroviral agents.Use with indinavir increases the concentrations of both nelfinavir andindinavir. Ritonavir increases the concentration of nelfinavir. Increases the concentration of saquinavir. Use of delavirdine increases the concentration of nelfinavir but decreases the concentration of delavirdine. Nevirapine decreases the nelfinavir C min. Carbamazepine andphenobarbital each decrease nelfinavir concentration and render it ineffective. 767Decreases the phenytoin concentration; monitor and adjust as indicated. Use with rifabutin increases the rifabutin concentration but either decreases (750mg tid) or has no effect (1250mg bid) on nelfinavir concentrations. The dose of rifabutin should be reduced by half when given with nelfinavir; the 1250mg bid dose is the preferred.Decreases methadone concentration; the dosage of methadone may need to be increased. Decreases ethinyl estradiol concentation; alternative or additional contraceptive measures should be used when oral contraceptives andnelfinavir are co-administered.

The incidence of both the AIDS syndrome and opportunistic infection has decreased dramatically over the last years because of advances in drug regimens. This is a rapidly changing area. Triple (e.g., zidovudine, lamivudine, nevirapine ) or quadruple therapy remains the standard of care for the management of HIV infection in adults because of its high efficacy. Nevirapine -based HAART (compared mainly with nelfinavir -based HAART), western African origin, and lower baseline viral load are associated with shorter times to achieving viral suppression and is probably a regimen of choice. A single dose of nevirapine (200mg PO) given at the onset of labor dramatically reduces perinatal HIV transmission in women receiving no otherantenatal antiretroviral therapy. It is more effective (in the absence of regular antiretroviral therapy) than an intrapartum and postpartum regimen of zidovudine if given to both women at the onset of labor and their newborns within 72h of birth.Nevirapine resistance does occur from this approach. However, a single dose of tenofovir andemtricitabine at delivery reduces resistance to NNRTIs at 6w postpartum by half; therefore, thistreatment should be considered as an adjuvant to intrapartum nevirapine. Women who receive a single dose of nevirapine to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV-1 have higher rates of failure with subsequent nevirapine -based antiretroviral therapy than do women without previous exposure to nevirapine if the therapy is initiated within 6mo after the single peripartum dose.Maternal risk factors include a low CD 4cell count and a high viral load at delivery. The addition of nevirapine during the labor of women receiving antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy does not further reduce perinatal HIV transmission if cesarean section is available. Cost and identification of women with HIV infectionduring pregnancy represent a significant problem in many developing countries. As a result, it has been proposed that, in high HIV prevalence areas, ''triple therapy'' be offered routinelyto all pregnant women and their infants without prior HIVtesting. The association between combination therapy that includes a protease inhibitor and an increased risk of very low birth weight requires confirmation. Hepatotoxicity usually doesnot manifest before 5mo of therapy.The WHO takes an incremental approach, recommending countries adopt more effective antiretroviral regimens. The 2006 guidelines include triple-drug antiretroviral treatment for thosewomen who are eligible. Those women who are not eligible for antiretroviral treatment should receive a combination prophylaxis antiretroviral regimen\u2014preferably zidovudine from 28w of gestation; and zidovudine andlamivudine for 7d after delivery\u2014to reduce the development of nevirapine resistance. Newborn infants should receive a single dose ofnevirapine and 1-4w of zidovudine, depending on the duration of the regimen received by the mother. Side effects include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, fever, hepatotoxicity, hepatitis, neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy, headache,arthralgia, and stomatitis. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. The safety of many approved antiretroviral agents during pregnancy is not established. In contrast to other protease inhibitors, nevirapine rapidly crosses the human placenta, reaching an F:M ratio approximating unity. A single 2mg/kg doseadministered to the newborn at 48-72h after birth achieves serum nevirapine concentrations 10 /C2thein vitro 50% inhibitory 774concentration against wild-type HIV-1 throughout the 1st week of life. This limited regimen is well-tolerated and reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission by nearly 50% in women and infants receiving no other antiretrovirals. However, neonatal plasmaconcentrations decrease more rapidly after maternal nevirapine therapy during pregnancy, suggesting in utero liver enzyme induction. Infants born <2h after maternal nevirapine during labor should receive a dose immediately after birth in addition tothe standard infant dose at 48-72h to ensure therapeutic levels. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursingwomen. Nevirapine is excreted into human breast milk with an M:P ratio approximating 0.6. Breastfeeding is contraindicated in HIV-infected nursing women when formula is available to reduce the risk of neonatal transmission. However, breastfeeding isessential in some countries, and intrapartum/neonatal nevirapine lowers HIV-1 transmission risk in breastfeeding women compared to a short intrapartum/neonatal zidovudine regimen. Nevirapine is measurable for up to 2w after discontinuation; total nevirapine concentrations remain above the 90% inhibitory concentration for6d, and no differences are observed between breasts. The absolute 8% reduction in transmission at 6-8w is sustained at age 18mo.This simple, inexpensive, well-tolerated regimen has the potentialto significantly decrease HIV-1 perinatal transmission in less developed countries. Continued neonatal nevirapine prophylaxis appears well-tolerated and further reduces the rate of HIV transmission. #Drug Interactions ................ Metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 and 2B6 and is a knowninducer of these enzymes. Drugs metabolized by these enzymesystems may have lower than expected plasma levels when used with nevirapine. The in vitro interaction between nevirapine andwarfarin is complex. Anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently. Significantly decreases clarithromycin; however, concentrations of the 14-OH metabolite are increased. Because the overall activity isreduced, options such as azithromycin should be considered. Decreases the concentration of efavirenz. Appropriate doses for this combination are not established. Decreases the concentrations of ethinyl estradiol /norethindrone. Thus oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. Increases the concentration of nevirapine. Patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine -associated adverse events when both drugs must be given together.Decreases indinavir such that an increased dosage may be required. Decreases ketoconazole concentrations and may reduce its efficacy. Decreases lopinavir when given as the lopinavir /ritonavir combination. It is recommended to increase the dose of lopinavir / ritonavir to 533/133mg bid when given with nevirapine. May decrease methadone levels, requiring increased dosages to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Decreases the concentration of the nelfinavir M8 metabolite and thenelfinavir C min. The appropriate dose for nelfinavir in combination with nevirapine has not been established. Modestly increases the concentration of rifabutin and its metabolite. Some patients may experience large increases and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Caution should be used. Rifampin decreases the concentration of nevirapine. The combination should not be used because it may reduce the 775efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine -containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. Decreases the concentration of saquinavir. Appropriate doses for this combination are not established, but an increase in the dose ofsaquinavir may be required. May decrease the concentrations 2007; Dis2002; 186:181-8.

The higher death rate from pellagra in women compared to men isattributed to an estrogen-mediated decrease in the formation of niacin from tryptophan. Pregnancy imposes a metabolic stress, which grows with advancing gestation. The recommended dose of niacinamide (a by-product of niacin ) varies between 15 and 17mg/d, and it is usually found in prenatal vitamins. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of niacin in pregnant women. Despite routine vitamin supplementation, a high percentage of vitamin A, B 6,B12,niacin , and thiamine hypovitaminemia occurs during pregnancy. Niacin deficiency is particularly common during the 1st trimester and its prevalenceincreases subsequently. Combination deficits of niacin ,thiamine , and vitamins A, B 6, and B 12occur in each trimester. There is no evidence that supplementation changes pregnancy outcome.Niacin deficiencies were once thought associated with preeclampsia and hyperemesis gravidarium, but these associationswere not confirmed by well-designed studies. effects include rhabdomyolysis, fibrillation, edema, amblyopia, and headache. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Niacin crosses the human placenta, though the 777kinetics remain to be elucidated. Rodent teratogenicity studies have not been conducted. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Niacin is excreted into human breast milk. It is not known whether supplementation increases both the milk andneonatal concentration. Niacin is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ May potentiate the effects of agents andvasoactive drugs, resulting in postural hypotension.About 98% available niacin bound to colestipol 10-30% binding to cholestyramine, suggesting at least 4-6h elapse between the ingestion of bile acid-binding resins and use of niacin. Ethanol or hot drinks may increase flushing and pruritus andshould be avoided around the time of niacin ingestion. Vitamins or other nutritional supplements containing large doses of niacin or related compounds such as nicotinamide may potentiate the adverse effects of niacin. #References .........................

Hypertension during pregnancy: Hypertension remains a significant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and death. Severe hypertension during pregnancy (BP >170/110mmHg) should be treated immediately to improve both maternal and fetal outcome. An uncontrolled reduction in BP may lead to coma, stroke, MI, acute renal failure, and death. Pregnancy further complicates the treatment of an acute hypertensive episode because an acutedecrease in BP might adversely affect the fetus. Thus, the goal isnot just to decrease BP, but to do so with minimal adverse effects while preserving organ function. Randomized trials reveal that nicardipine is safe and effective for the treatment of severe hypertension during pregnancy. It is more efficient thanmetoprolol and similar to labetalol. Although the definitive treatment for severe preeclampsia remains delivery, somepractitioners attempt to temporize in hopes of reducing thecomplications of prematurity. Preliminary study indicates thatlong-term treatment with nicardipine for severe preeclampsia is effective and safe. Nicardipine has also been used during pregnancy to treat hypertension due to pheochromocytoma andautonomic hyperreflexia. Preterm labor: Nicardipine abolishes in vitro contractility of the smooth muscle strips. It causes a modest decline in systolic (9mmHg) and diastolic (7mmHg) pressures in normotensivepatients as peripheral resistance falls. The reflex increase in HR is usually small, but may occasionally be pronounced. One prospective clinical trial concluded that nicardipine is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated tocolytic agent. It arrests pretermlabor more rapidly than magnesium sulfate, and women treated with nicardipine have fewer adverse medication effects and episodes of recurrent preterm labor compared to those treatedwith magnesium sulfate. Treatment-related maternal hypotension was not associated with fetal distress. In another trial, nicardipine led to a greater percentage of women delivering more than 7dafter diagnosis compared to salbutamol, and there were fewer maternal side effects. Nicardipine seems especially attractive in women with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or maternalcardiomyopathy. A relationship between oral erythromycin and sudden cardiac death was reported in patients also receivingstrong inhibitors of CYP3A such as nitroimidazole antifungal agents, diltiazem, verapamil, andtroleandomycin; each doubles, at least, the AUC for a CYP3A substrate. The potential implication for obstetrics is real with the growing use of nicardipine as a tocolytic agent in women who may also be treated with antibiotics for PPROM. Though not included in the referenced study, nicardipine is also a substrate for CYP3A, suggesting the likelihood for some interaction is high. SeeNifedipine. Side effects include edema, flushing, asthenia, malaise, N/V, dyspnea, palpitations, tachycardia, dizziness, abnormalities, and orthostatic hypotension. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. In one study of 10 preeclamptic women, nicardipine was measured in maternal and umbilical cord blood. There was a median F:M ratio of 0.15 (umbilical artery) and 0.17 (umbilical vein). The highest cord concentration after maternal dosage of 4.5mg/h was a subtherapeutic 18ng/ml. Thus, adverse fetal reactions are unlikely due to a direct nicardipine effect. Consistent with these observations, transfer across the nonhumanprimate placenta is poor, and there is no effect on fetal CV parameters after maternal administration. Nicardipine may have 779some beneficial effect on fetoplacental blood flow resistances in animals and humans. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. Embryotoxicity occurred atdoses 50 /C2the MRHD. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Nicardipine levels were determined in 34 breast milk samples from 7 preeclamptic women receiving IV nicardipine. Nicardipine was undetectable in 82% of samples. In 6 samples from 4 women with doses ranging from 1 to 6.5mg/h, milknicardipine ranged from 5.1 to 18.5ng/ml. The maximum possible exposure of a neonate to nicardipine was calculated to be less than 300ng/d, which is an insignificant fraction of the therapeutic dose used in neonates. #Drug Interactions ................ Cimetidine increases nicardipine plasma levels. Patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly should be carefully monitored.Some calcium blockers increase the concentration of digitalis. Severe hypotension has been reported during fentanyl anesthesia with concomitant use of a b-blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Even though such interactions were not seen duringclinical studies with nicardipine, an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were tooccur. Increases cyclosporine levels. Plasma cyclosporine should be closely monitored, and its dose reduced as necessary. #References .........................

Cigarette smoking is directly linked to an array of health careproblems whose costs to society are staggering. Active and passivematernal smoking has damaging effects in each trimester. Cigarette smoke contains numerous toxins that exert a direct effect on placental and fetal cell proliferation and differentiation.It is the single largest modifiable risk for pregnancy-relatedmorbidity and death in the US. Cigarette smoking increases the rate of subfertility and failed IVF. Addiction to nicotine is a primary contributor to tobacco use. Nicotine replacement facilitates cessation by relieving the physiologic symptoms of withdrawal. Nicotine delivery systems include gum, patch, nasal spray, and vapor inhaler. Because nicotine medications do not deliver the toxins and carcinogens delivered by cigarettes, they areconsidered safer than smoking if used as directed. Women shouldbe advised to stop smoking completely during pregnancy, and that 781a simple reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked, or switching to so-called low-tar or low- nicotine concentration cigarettes will not significantly reduce the perinatal risks. Nicotine patch therapy may help some pregnant smokers, but the successrate during pregnancy is low. Despite the failure of large numbers of treated women to quit, the average birth weight is increased by therapy. The success rate may be enhanced by the addition of anSSRI and formal counseling. Preliminary study suggests womenwho cannot quit smoking after the 1st trimester metabolize nicotine more rapidly than those who can. Thus, the optimal response may be to raise the support level during pregnancy, not lower it. Social support systems can enhance the likelihood oflong-term success in women who do quit smoking during pregnancy. The initial dose of nicotine during replacement therapy should approximate the dose of nicotine being consumed. Intermittent-use formulations of NRT (gum, spray, inhaler) are preferred as the total dose of nicotine delivered to the fetus is less than with continuous-use formulations (transdermal patch).Side effects include ventricular local erythema, local pruritus, N/V, diarrhea, insomnia, headache, nervousness, abnormal dreams, dizziness, and rash. #Fetal Considerations ........... Cigarette smoke contains thousands of chemicals, many of which are well-documented reproductive toxins (e.g., nicotine, carbon monoxide, lead). Nicotine rapidly crosses the placenta, and the fetuses of mothers who smoke are exposed to higher concentrations than their mothers. Smoking during pregnancy is a major risk factor for spontaneous abortion, preterm placental abruption, IUGR, late fetal death, neonatal polycythemia, andSIDS. The increased miscarriage rate among mothers who smoke may be related to direct adverse effects of nicotine, cadmium, or the polyaromatic hydrocarbons on trophoblast invasion and proliferation. The mean reduction in birth weight in infants ofsmokers is 200g. Recent study indicates a greater prevalence of facial clefts in the offspring of smokers. Longitudinal studies in humans suggest that prenatal exposure to nicotine increases the risks for cognitive deficits, ADHD, conduct disorder, criminalityin adulthood, and a predisposition of the offspring to abuse tobacco and alcohol. Sheep and human studies reveal that prenatal nicotine blunts elements of the fetal cardiorespiratory defense for hypoxia (HR, ventilatory and arousal responses), and has long-term effects on the postnatal breathing pattern. The newborn unable to maximize cardiac output during times ofstress is at increased risk for morbidity and possible death. Acuteexposure to nicotine significantly decreases fetal heart reactivity. Median epinephrine and NE concentrations in the umbilical cord are significantly lower in smokers compared with nonsmokers.The significance of this finding is unclear, but could reflectdepletion. The finding of increased connective tissue expression in pulmonary vessels of fetal monkeys whose mothers were treated with nicotine suggests nicotine is transported across the placenta and directly interacts with nicotinic ACH receptors in pulmonaryvessels to alter connective tissue expression and produce vascular structural alterations. Rodent studies show that nicotine exposure compromises neuronal maturation, leading to long-lasting structural alterations in key brain regions involved with cognition, learning, and memory. Human neonatal nicotine withdrawal does occur. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Nicotine is excreted in human milk at low concentrations. Milk cotinine (a by-product of nicotine ) levels do not correlate with 782the number of cigarettes smoked. Newborns breastfed by smoking women are exposed not only to environmental (''passive'') smoke, but also by ingesting nicotine metabolites and toxic by- products present in the milk. Maternal smoking cessation with the nicotine patch is a safer option than continued smoking. In one study of 15 women, the milk nicotine and cotinine concentrations were no different between smoking (mean of 17 cigarettes/d) and the 21mg/d patch, but concentrations werelower when patients were using the 14mg/d and 7mg/d patches. There was also a downward trend in absolute infant dose (nicotine equivalents) from smoking or the 21mg patch throughto the 14mg and 7mg patches. Infant milk intake was similarregardless of whether their mothers were smoking or subsequently using the 21mg, 14mg, and 7mg patches. #Drug Interactions ................ Because of the de-induction of hepatic enzymes after smoking cessation, the following drugs may require a decrease in dosage: acetaminophen, caffeine, theophylline . The extent of absorption and peak plasma concentration is slightly reduced in patients with the common cold/rhinitis. In addition, the T maxis prolonged. The use of a nasal vasoconstrictor such as xylometazoline in patients with rhinitiswill further prolong the time to peak. Circulating catecholamines decline after smoking cessation. As a result, the dose of adrenergic agonists (e.g., isoproterenol Jenkins D. Ir Med J Wolff MS. DA, Benowitz NL. Exp Ther2002; Crit Care Med 2002; 166:1530-1. Oncken CA, Henry KM, Campbell WA, et al.

Hypertension during pregnancy: Hypertension remains a significant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and death. Severe hypertension during pregnancy (BP >170/110mmHg) should be treated immediately to improve both maternal and fetal outcome. An uncontrolled reduction in BP may lead to coma, stroke, MI,acute renal failure, and death. Treatment of an acute hypertensive episode during pregnancy further complicates the process because an acute decrease in BP might adversely affect the fetus. Thus, thegoal is not just to decrease BP, but to do so with minimaladverse effects while preserving organ function. Nifedipine is proven safe and effective. The antihypertensive effect ofnifedipine does not correlate with the serum concentration. Given PO or SL, nifedipine (8-10mg /C21) has a longer duration of action and is more effective than either IV hydralazine (5- 10mg /C21) or IV labetolol (20mg /C21). In randomized trials, nifedipine retard was as effective as the rapidly acting formuation, though women given the retard form required a 2nd dose more frequently. One approach is to observe the patient 24hto learn the proper timing of nifedipine. This is based on the observation that hypertension is more pronounced at night inwomen with preeclampsia compared to chronic hypertension. Maternal cerebral blood flow is influenced by antihypertensive treatment. A reduction in middle cerebral artery flow velocitiesafter nifedipine andmethyldopa confirms that cerebral vasospasm occurs in preeclamptic women. In contrast to the middle cerebral artery, there is no change in uteroplacental Doppler-determined resistances alone improves perinatal outcome. Tocolysis changes perinataloutcome by allowing time for corticosteroid administration.When compared to placebo and any other tocolytic agent, calcium channel blockers and specifically nifedipine reduce the number of women giving birth within 48h or 7d of diagnosis. The doses used ranged widely from 30 to 240mg/d untilcontractions stop; 40mg PO q4-6h seem the typical starting dose. Like all other tocolytic agents, maintenance use offers no added benefit. The frequency of drug discontinuation for adverse effectsis also dramatically reduced for nifedipine compared to all other tocolytic agents. In steady state, the mean nifedipine plasma concentration to achieve tocolysis is about the half of thatmeasured after initial tocolysis. The use of nifedipine with magnesium sulfate is potentially dangerous; the combination is more frequently associated with severe hypotension,neuromuscular blockade, and cardiac depression. Similar to allother agents, maintenance therapy with oral nifedipine after the successful treatment of presumed preterm labor does not alter the timing of delivery. Several case reports note the occurrence of acute MI during the use of nifedipine for tocolysis. A short interval between cessation of b-mimetic therapy and the start ofnifedipine may have had a role. Recently, a relationship 785between oral erythromycin and sudden cardiac death was reported in patients also receiving strong inhibitors of CYP3A such as nitroimidazole antifungal agents, diltiazem, verapamil, andtroleandomycin; each doubles, at least, the AUC for a CYP3A substrate. The potential implication for obstetrics is realwith the growing use of nifedipine as a tocolytic agent in women who may also be treated with antibiotics for PPROM. Though not included in the referenced study, nifedipine is also a substrate for CYP3A, suggesting the likelihood for some interaction is high. Pulmonary hypertension: The treatment of pulmonary hypertension during pregnancy remains controversial in part because of its rarityand complexity. Some authors consider PO nifedipine and IV prostacyclin, guided by right pulmonary artery catheterization and Doppler measurements of cardiac output, effective.Side effects include flushing, CHF, pulmonary edema, dyspnea, MI, headache, N/V, dizziness, peripheral edema, nervousness, weakness, wheezing, nasal congestion, pruritus, and muscle cramps. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Nifedipine crosses the human placenta, achieving an F:M ratio approximating 0.75. Newborns exposed to nifedipine have lower NICU admission rates and lower incidences of RDS, intracranial bleeding, and neonatal jaundice. Part of the benefit, but not all, appears to be prolongation of pregnancy. Placental and fetal cerebral arterial blood flow, fetalsystolic and diastolic cardiac function, and the downstreamdistribution of fetal cardiac output are unaffected by nifedipine loading. However, a beneficial effect of nifedipine on placental blood flow cannot be excluded. In one study that tested fetusesbefore and after 48h of nifedipine tocolysis, there was a decline in uterine artery and fetal middle cerebral artery Doppler indices24h after the first dose. Fetal cardiac diastolic function wasunaffected and the significant redistribution observed after 24h islikely attributable to altered cerebral blood flow. Nifedipine is teratogenic and embryotoxic in rodents, increasing the prevalenceof skeletal abnormalities, cleft palate, and IUGR. Its use insubhuman primates is associated with small placentas. In the ewe,nifedipine is associated with a fetal acidemia despite little change in uteroplacental blood flows. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Nifedipine is excreted into human breast milk, achieving an M:P ratio approximating 0.3. It is unlikely the nursing newborn wouldingest a clinically relevant amount. #Drug Interactions ................ Use with b-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there are occasional reports the combination increases the likelihood ofCHF, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina.There are isolated reports of elevated digoxin levels, suggesting a possible interaction between digoxin andnifedipine. Use of XR nifedipine increased digoxin levels in 9 of 12 patients an average of 45%. Thus, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored closely when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuingnifedipine. There are rare reports of decreased quinidine. There are reports of increased PTs in patients taking coumarin. In healthy volunteers, cimetidine (1000mg/d for 1w) was associated with increased nifedipine peak levels (80%) and AUC (74%). The effect is probably mediated by the known inhibitionof hepatic CYP3A4 by cimetidine. Grapefruit juice resulted in a 2-fold increase in nifedipine AUC and C maxwith no change in t/2 most likely due to inhibition of 786CYP3A4-related first-pass metabolism. Use of nifedipine with grapefruit juice is to be avoided. #References 104:682-8.

Nimodipine is a calcium channel blocker with selective cerebrovascular effect. Hypertension during pregnancy: Hypertension remains a significant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and death. Severehypertension during pregnancy (BP >170/110mmHg) should be treated immediately to improve both maternal and fetal outcome. An uncontrolled reduction in BP may lead to coma, stroke, MI, acute renal failure, and death. Pregnancy further complicates thetreatment of an acute hypertensive episode since an acutedecrease in BP might adversely affect the fetus. Thus, the goal is not just to decrease BP, but to do so with minimal adverse effects while preserving organ function. Cerebral perfusion pressure maybe either high or low in women with preeclampsia and eclampsia.A recent Cochrane review concluded based on a series of adverse outcomes that nimodipine should be avoided for this indication. Specifically, it was associated with a higher risk of eclampsia (relative risk [RR] 2.24, 95% significantly Doppler-measured of the vessels. 788Compared to magnesium sulfate, nimodipine increases cerebral perfusion pressure in women with severe preeclampsia. While once suggested as an agent to prevent eclampsia, it is inferior to magnesium sulfate as prophylaxis. Preterm labor: When compared with any other tocolytic agent, calcium channel blockers reduce the number of women givingbirth within 48h or 7d of diagnosis. The frequency of drugdiscontinuation for adverse effects is also dramatically reduced.There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of nimodipine for tocolysis in pregnant women. It is an effective inhibitor of uterine contractions in vitro. Either nifedipine or nicardipine would be preferable. Psychiatric disorders: Nimodipine may be an alternative to lithium in pregnant women with bipolar disorder. Side effects include hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, arrhythmia, ECG abnormalities, AV conduction thrombocytopenia, thromboembolism, elevated LFTs, diarrhea, edema, dyspnea, headache, rash, dyspepsia, anemia, acne, muscle aches, and flushing. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Nimodipine crosses the human placenta, reaching an F:M ratio approaching unity within several hours. Maternaladministration reduces both maternal and fetal cerebral resistances. Rodent studies are somewhat conflicting. Placental transfer is inefficient. Embryotoxicity, teratogenicity, and IUGRare reported in some models, but it occurs in a non-dose-dependent fashion. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Nimodipine enters human breast milk. In one case report, the M:P ratio approximated 0.1. It was estimated thebreastfed newborn would ingest a clinically insignificant amountranging between 0.008% and 0.092% of the weight-adjustedmaternal dose. #Drug Interactions ................ The cardiovascular action of other calcium channel blockers maybe enhanced.Cimetidine (1000mg/d for 1w) in a study in healthy volunteers increased the nimodipine peak concentration 50% and the AUC 90%, probably secondary to the known inhibition of hepaticCYP3A4 by cimetidine. #References .........................

Hypertension remains a significant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and death. Severe hypertension during pregnancy (BP >170/110mmHg) should be treated immediately to improve both maternal and fetal outcome. An uncontrolled reduction in BPmay lead to coma, stroke, MI, acute renal failure, and death. Treatment of an acute hypertensive episode during pregnancy further complicates the process, because an acute decrease in BPmight adversely affect the fetus. Thus, the goal is not just todecrease BP, but to do so with minimal adverse effects while preserving organ function. In one study, nisoldipine was used to treat preeclamptic women with severe postpartum hypertension. A rapid and significant fall in BP was seen within 30min, and maintained successfully by repeating nisoldipine for the duration of the study period. There were no adverse reactions. Side effects include vasodilation, headache, palpitation, chest pain, CHF, 1st degree AV block, dizziness, pharyngitis, edema, rash, N/V, increased LFTs, sinusitis, and malaise. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether nisoldipine crosses the human placenta. Nisoldipine was unassociated with changes in the FHR despite maternal bradycardia. Rodent studies conductedat doses that cause maternal toxicity were associated withembryotoxicity. 790#Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women.

UTI is common during pregnancy, and all pregnant women should be screened. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and recurrent cystitis during pregnancy reduces the risk of pyelonephritis. Ampicillin should not be used because of the high prevalence of resistant E. coli. Nitrofurantoin is highly soluble in urine. It is safe and effective for the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria as well as acute and recurrent UTIs. Resistance rates are<10%. Pyelonephritis occurs in approximately 7% of women despite adequate treatment. Women with recurrent UTI are 791candidates for long-term antibiotic prophylaxis. Neither gravidity nor pyelonephritis alters the renal excretion or blood concentration of nitrofurantoin. However, labor reduces renal excretion and increases the blood level. Thus, nitrofurantoin is a poor selection for therapy during labor. Acute pulmonaryreactions to nitrofurantoin, presumably immune-mediated, are uncommon but may be life-threatening. Symptoms include fever, chills, cough, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, pleural effusion, andpulmonary hemorrhage. The drug should be discontinued and corticosteroids initiated for severe reactions. Irreversible pulmonary fibrosis is also reported. Patients with G6PD deficiency may experience hemolytic reactions. It remains unclear how longa woman with asymptomatic bacteriuria should be treated, and there are no randomized studies. Some suggest that short-term administration combined with continued surveillance forrecurrent bacteriuria is sufficient.Side are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether nitrofurantoin crosses the human placenta. There is no evidence nitrofurantoin is a human teratogen. Although contraindicated in labor and in infants <1mo, there are no well-documented cases of hemolytic reactions in neonates. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... The long clinical experience is reassuring, though the literature is conflicting. One study whose subjects received 100mg concluded nitrofurantoin is actively transported into human milk, and that a nursing newborn could ingest 6% of the maternal dose. Another study whose subjects received 50mg found a much lowerM:P ratio and concluded the likelihood of a nursing newborn ingesting a clinically relevant amount of nitrofurantoin was low. Thus, concern remains for breastfeeding women treated therapeutically with nitrofurantoin if they have a family history of G6PD deficiency or sensitivity to nitrofurantoin. #Drug Interactions ................ Antacids magnesium trisilicate reduce both the rateand extent of nitrofurantoin absorption. The mechanism for this interaction probably is adsorption of nitrofurantoin onto the surface of magnesium trisilicate.Uricosuric drugs probenecid, sulfinpyrazone ) inhibit renal tubular secretion of nitrofurantoin and may cause nitrofurantoin toxicity. Further, the decreased urine concentration reduces itsefficacy as a urinary tract antibacterial. 21:141-4. Ben David S, Y, et al. Fundam ClinPharmacol 1995; Ther 1986; 12:38-42.

Hypertension during pregnancy: Hypertension remains a significant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and death. Severe hypertension during pregnancy (BP >170/110mmHg) should be treated immediately to improve both maternal and fetal outcome. An uncontrolled reduction in BP may lead to coma, stroke, MI, 794acute renal failure, and death. Treatment of a hypertensive episode during pregnancy further complicates the process because an acute decrease in BP might adversely affect the fetus. Thus, the goal is not just to decrease BP, but to do so with minimaladverse effects while preserving organ function. It is suggested NO donors may have a therapeutic role in preeclampsia. Doppler studies are conflicting. Some investigators report vascular smoothmuscle sensitivity to nitroglycerin is unaltered by preeclampsia, while others observe that nitroglycerin produces a more profound decrease in BP of preeclamptic women compared tonormal subjects. Nitroglycerin also causes a fall in the resistance indices of the uterine arteries whether administered acutely orchronically. It is unknown whether the decline in resistance is associated with an increase in perfusion. Low-dose prophylactic nitroglycerin beginning in the 2nd trimester does not reduce the incidence of preeclampsia or IUGR.Cervical ripening and tocolysis: The NO-cGMP relaxation pathway is present in the human cervix and uterus and it has beenpostulated NO may have a physiologic role in uterine quiescenceand cervical ripening. High doses of sublingual or IV nitroglycerin have been used acutely as a uterine relaxant to assist fetal surgery, fetal extraction at cesarean section, external version, internal intrapartum podalic version of the 2nd twin,manual exploration of the uterus to remove a retained placenta, and replacement of an inverted uterus. Yet placebo-controlled trials demonstrate nitroglycerin is no better than placebo for the facilitation of fetal extraction at cesarean section, or forexternal version. IV nitroglycerin currently continues to be used intra- and postoperatively to facilitate uterine relaxation duringor after open uterine fetal surgery. Pulmonary edema is the mostcommon complication. The short t/2 (2.5min) of nitroglycerin makes long-term therapy difficult, and tolerance is associatedwith longer acting donors. Nitroglycerin has also been used for intrapartum management of fetal distress. In a recent RCT, therewas no difference between nitroglycerin andterbutaline in successful acute intrapartum fetal resuscitation. However,terbutaline provided more effective tocolysis with less impact on maternal BP. There are no identifiable placebo-controlled trials ofintrauterine resuscitation. While nitroglycerin reduces the force necessary to dilate the cervix for a 1st trimester termination, it isless effective than prostaglandins for cervical ripening.Nitroglycerin has also proved a poor tocolytic. It does not inhibit uterine contractility in sheep. In laboring women, a 800mcg/dosereduces BP but has no effect on either uterine tone orcontractility. Controversy continues regarding the ability ofnitroglycerin to prevent preterm labor. Nitroglycerin is more effective than placebo but similar to a b-agonist or magnesium sulfate as a tocolytic agent. Its purported ability to delay labor was gestational age dependent.Side effects hypotension, methemoglobinemia, anaphylactic flushing, and edema. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. When given to women with mild preeclampsia,nitroglycerin is associated with a decrease in the resistance in fetoplacental circulation approximately 20-30min afteradministration. Low levels of nitroglycerin are found in the fetus after its use to facilitate an acute obstetric procedure. Sheepstudies reveal no adverse fetal effects after maternal administration. There is no effect on fetal carotid blood flow. 795Rodent teratogenicity studies are reassuring, but limited by dose and format. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether nitroglycerin enters human breast milk. However, considering the indication, dosing, and clearance rate,limited nitroglycerin use is unlikely to pose a clinically significant risk to the breastfeeding neonate. #Drug Interactions ................ Ethanol may enhance sensitivity to the hypotensive effects ofnitrates.The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used in combination. Dose adjustmentsof either agent may be necessary. #References ......................... Anumba 1999; 181:1479-84.Belfort MA. S Afr Med J 1993; 83:656. Black RS, Lees C, Thompson C, et al.

One molecule of nitroprusside combines with Hb to produce 1 molecule of cyanmethemoglobin and 4 CN/C0ions. Thiosulfate reacts with cyanide to produce thiocyanate. Thiocyanate is eliminated in the urine. Cyanide not otherwise removed binds to cytochromes. Cyanide is much more toxic than methemoglobin or thiocyanate.Hypertension during pregnancy: Hypertension remains a significant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and death. Severe hypertension during pregnancy (BP >170/110mmHg) should be treated immediately to improve both maternal and fetal outcome. An uncontrolled reduction in BP may lead to coma, stroke, MI,acute renal failure, and death. Treatment of an acute hypertensive episode during pregnancy further complicates the process because an acute decrease in BP might adversely affect the fetus. Thus, thegoal is not just to decrease BP, but to do so with minimaladverse effects while preserving organ function. It has been suggested NO donors could have a therapeutic role in preeclampsia. IV nitroprusside is an excellent hypotensive agent with the added advantage of a titratable effect. Nitroprusside exerts its relaxant effect by an endothelium-independentmechanism. Pharmacologic studies reveal that in vitro vasorelaxation in response to nitroprusside is attenuated in vessels obtained from preeclamptic women. Conversely, many severely preeclampsia patients are relatively or absolutely hypovolemic. In these patients, systemic BP may be extremelysensitive to small doses. Therefore, some clinicians begin therapyat lower rates of infusion (e.g., 0.5-0.1mcg/min). Cervical ripening: The NO-cGMP relaxation pathway is present in the human and cervix uterus. Nitroprusside decreases collagen cross-links in the guinea pig cervix. It reduces the force necessaryto dilate the cervix for a 1st trimester termination. Side effects include increased ICP, dizziness, N/V, cyanide or thiocyanate toxicity, bradycardia, reflex tachycardia, ileus,diaphoresis, abdominal pain, headache, muscle twitching, acidosis, and flushing. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether nitroprusside crosses the human placenta. Nitroprusside dilates the fetal vascular bed of the isolated perfused placenta, and its efficacy is unaffected bypreeclampsia or IUGR. Fetal cyanide toxicity occurs in sheep after maternal administration. It is reversed by maternal administration of sodium thiosulfate, which unfortunately does not cross thehuman placenta. Rodent teratogenicity studies have not beenperformed. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether nitroprusside enters human breast milk. However, considering the indication, dosing, and clearance rate, limited nitroprusside use is unlikely to pose a clinically significant risk to the breastfeeding neonate. #Drug Interactions ................ The hypotensive effect is augmented by most other hypotensivedrugs, including ganglionic blocking agents, negative inotropic agents, and inhaled anesthetics. #References .........................

Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGRdespite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Nizatidine is scantly excreted into human breast milk. On average, <0.1% of the maternal dose is secreted during a 12h interval after either single or multiple doses. This is lessthan either cimetidine orranitidine.

There is no indication for norgestrel during pregnancy. Efficacy of the IUD is excellent regardless of parity, with <1 pregnancy per 100 woman-years. Efficacy with immediate postabortalinsertion is also good and unaffected by parity. The presence of an IUD does not increase the risk of PID or infertility in eitherparous or nulliparous women and it may be protective againstinfection. Side effects include acne, hirsuitism, weight gain, headache, breast tenderness, N/V, thromboembolism, MI, hypertension, hepatic 804adenoma, edema, breakthrough bleeding, altered bleeding, amenorrhea, melasma, rash, and dizziness. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofnorgestrel in human fetuses. In utero exposure of male fetuses to progestational agents may double the risk of hypospadias. Whilethere are insufficient data to quantify the risk for the female fetus,some progestational agents may cause mild virilization of theexternal genitalia. Defects outside the external genitalia are not reported in either humans or rodents. 1st trimester exposure is an indication for a detailed anatomic ultrasound between 18and 22w. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Norgestrel is excreted into maternal milk. Maintaining a time interval between mini-pill intake and breastfeeding results inhigher levels in breast milk, thus exposing the newborn to a bolusof drug in a ''single-delayed'' feed. Long-term follow-up studies reveal that progestogen-only contraceptives do not adversely affect breastfeeding and infant development. #Drug Interactions ................ Published studies reveal decreased norgestrel concentrations in women who require chronic use of carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, orphenytoin, presumably through the induction of microsomal liver enzymes. For women receiving long-term therapy with hepatic enzyme inducers, a different method of contraception short-term therapy with hepatic shouldconsider using a backup method of contraception. Rifampicin decreases the effectiveness of combination oral contraceptives; its effect on norgestrel concentrations has not been established. Data from clinical trials of Norplant, however, note low serum concentrations and a subsequent pregnancy in one woman using rifampicin. Herbal products containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids. #References .........................

Depression is common during and after pregnancy, but typically goes unrecognized. Pregnancy is not a reason a priori to discontinue psychotropic drugs. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of nortriptyline in pregnant women. Women who experienced one episode of postpartum-onset major depression are at high risk for subsequent recurrence. Unfortunately, nortriptyline is no different than placebo as prophylaxis for the prevention of recurrent postpartum depression in a high-risk population. Cigarette smoking during pregnancy is the single largest modifiable risk for pregnancy-related morbidity and death in the US. Although NRT (gum,patch, nasal spray, and inhaler) combined with bupropion has the highest rate of success, nortriptyline also has a positive impact on smoking cessation rates. Nortriptyline is used for the treatment of neuropathic pain, chronic pain, and panic disorder.Its use for these indications may be avoidable during pregnancy. Side effects include seizures, MI, stroke, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, confusion, disorientation, constipation, tachycardia, dizziness, increased appetite, blurred vision,drowsiness, and dry mouth. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. Maternal and umbilical cord sera were collected at delivery from 10 women taking nortriptyline. The F:M ratios of nortriptyline and 1.40 \u00b1 2.40, Fetal exposure may be limited because of its lipophilicity. A case report suggested an association between nortriptyline and limb anomalies. There is no other support for this possibility. Rodent teratogenicity studies have yielded conflicting results. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Nortriptyline is excreted at low concentration into human breast milk. It is estimated the newborn would ingest only 2.5% of thecorresponding maternal weight-corrected dose. Not surprisingly, nortriptyline levels are typically at or below the level of detection in the nursing newborn. Nortriptyline is generally considered a drug of choice for breastfeeding women suffering from depression. 806#Drug Interactions ................ Use of reserpine with TCAs has been shown to have a ''stimulating'' effect in some depressed patients. Close supervision and careful adjustment of the dose is required when used with other anticholinergic drugs andsympathomimetic drugs. Use with cimetidine can produce clinically significant increases in the plasma concentrations of the TCA. The patient should be informed that the response to ethanol may be exaggerated.Significant hypoglycemia was reported in a type 2 diabetic patient maintained on chlorpropamide (250mg/d) after the addition first-line agents for the treatment of most depressive and anxiety disorders. /C15Nortriptyline should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if the benefit justifies the potential perinatal risk. /C15Nortriptyline is generally considered a drug of choice for breastfeeding women suffering from depression.

Candida vaginitis is perhaps the most common female genital tract infection. Nystatin is an antifungal antibiotic that is both fungistatic and fungicidal in vitro against a wide variety of yeasts and yeastlike fungi. It is a polyene antibiotic obtained from 808Streptomyces noursei. The vaginal milieu during pregnancy predisposes to C. albicans overgrowth. In vitro, nystatin is highly effective against 83% of sensitive strains of tested C. albicans. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of nystatin in pregnant women. It is not clear whether the various imidazole compounds differ in efficacy for mycotic vaginitis.Nystatin is thought less effective than miconazole for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis during pregnancy, though thereare no randomized trials to substantiate this conclusion. There is no significant difference in the cure rates achieved after 7d or 14d of therapy. More patients relapsed after a cure with nystatin than with miconazole. Side effects include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, local irritation, N/V, and diarrhea. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether nystatin crosses the human placenta. 1st trimester use of nystatin (and imidazole agents) is unassociated with an increased prevalence ofspontaneous abortion or fetal malformation. Congenital candidiasis of the neonate's skin rarely occurs, and nystatin is used to treat this infection and avoid septicemia. Rodent teratogenicity studies are limited to a single report where fetallosses were associated with maternal toxicity. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. It is unknown whether nystatin enters human breast milk. However, considering the indication and dosing, limited nystatin use is unlikely to pose a clinically significant risk to the breastfeeding neonate. Nystatin is not effective treatment of nipple candidiasis. #Drug Interactions ................ No clinically relevant interactions identified. #References Bodley V, Powers D.

Octreotide reportedly improves implantation in supraovulated mice. headache. Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is not known whether octreotide crosses the human placenta. It does not affect placental GH production.Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence ofteratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women.

The FDA has added a black box warning covering the potential for tendon rupture.Side effects include vaginitis, photosensitivity, pseudomembranous colitis, seizures, increased ICP, headache,psychosis, N/V, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, dizziness, insomnia, agitation, tendonitis, arthralgias, and elevated LFTs. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Less than 4% of maternal ofloxacin crosses the isolated perfused human placenta, though clearance is such thatpotentially therapeutic levels in AF and sera make it a candidatefor fetal therapy if otherwise safe. In humans, fluoroquinolones are not associated with an increased risk of malformation. Neither ophthalmic nor otic application results in significantsystemic drug levels. In general, rodent studies are reassuring,though some rodent models using otic application revealed minor skeletal abnormalities and IUGR. The administration of very high multiples of the MRHD is associated with fetal toxicity. 812#Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. Ofloxacin achieves an M:P ratio of /C211 but is consistently lower than ciprofloxacin. Serum and milk were obtained from 10 women simultaneously at 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and24h after ofloxacin. The mean breast milk levels were 2.4, 1.9, 1.3, 0.6, 0.3, and 0.05mcg/ml, respectively. Even with 100% oralabsorption, breastfeeding mothers who take ofloxacin will expose their infants to ofloxacin concentrations below that being studied in the pediatric population. #Drug Interactions ................ Quinolones form chelates with alkaline earth quinolones antacids containing zinc;or with didanosine chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may substantially interfere with theabsorption of quinolones, resulting in systemic levels considerably lower than desired. These agents should not be taken within 2h before or after ofloxacin. Cimetidine interferes with the elimination of some quinolones, resulting in significant increases in their t/2 and AUC. Thepotential interaction between ofloxacin andcimetidine has not been studied.Elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported with concomitant use of cyclosporine with some other quinolones. The potential for interaction between ofloxacin andcyclosporine has not been studied.Most quinolones inhibit CYPs, which may lead to a prolonged t/2 for some drugs metabolized by this system (e.g., cyclosporine , theophylline /methylxanthines, warfarin ). The extent of this inhibition varies among different quinolones.Use with NSAIDs may increase the risk of CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures.Probenecid has been reported to affect renal tubular secretion of other quinolones. Its effect on the elimination of ofloxacin has not been studied.Steady-state theophylline levels may increase when used with ofloxacin. Theophylline levels should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted as indicated. Adverse reactions (including seizures) may occur with or without an elevation in the serum theophylline level. Some quinolones have been reported to enhance the effects of warfarin or its derivatives. The PT or other suitable coagulation test should be monitored closely. Since disturbances of blood glucose, including hyperglycemia andhypoglycemia, are reported in patients treated with quinolones and an antidiabetic agent, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended.May produce false-positive urine screening results foropiates using commercially available immunoassay kits. Confirmation of positive opiate screens by more specific methods is necessary. #References ......................... Giamarellou H, Kolokythas E, Petrikkos G, et al. Am J Med 1989; 87:49S-51S.

However, effectiveness or side effects areunaltered. Patients treated with olanzapine for schizophrenia have less akathisia but more weight gain than patients treated with haloperidol. Compliance, symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms, and overall quality of life are similar for the two drugs, but costs are significantly greater with olanzapine. While there are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women, the growing body of clinical experience with olanzapine during pregnancy is reassuring. Side effects include hypotension, tachycardia, menstrual irregularities, hyperprolactinemia, tardive dyspepsia,rhinitis, fever, and elevated LFTs. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. In one study, the mean F:M ratio was variablebut overall quite high (72.1%; standard deviation [SD] = 42.0%); it was only about 33% in a second report. This contrasts with quetiapine (mean = 23.8%, SD = 11.0%). There were tendencies toward higher rates of low birth weight (30.8%) and NICUadmission (30.8%) among neonates exposed to olanzapine. The pregnancy outcomes of women who contacted a teratogeninformation service after exposure to olanzapine appeared normal. As for most psychotropic drugs, monotherapy and the lowest effective quantity given in divided doses to minimize the peaks can minimize the risks. Rodent studies are reassuring,revealing no evidence of teratogenicity despite the use of doseshigher than those used clinically. Embryo and fetal toxicities were seen with high doses. There was no effect of intrauterine exposure on postnatal learning. 814#Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women.

Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine, caution should be used when combining it with other centrally acting drugs andethanol.May enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents, butmay antagonize the effects of levodopa andrifampin, may clearance. Inhibitors of CYP1A2 may likewise inhibit olanzapine clearance despite the fact that olanzapine is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems.Activated charcoal (1g) reduced the C maxand AUC of oral olanzapine by about 60%. As peak olanzapine levels are not typically obtained until about 6h after dosing, charcoal may be a useful treatment for overdose. Carbamazepine (200mg bid) causes an approximately 50% increase inolanzapine clearance, likely because carbamazepine is a potent inducer of CYP1A2 activity. Higher daily doses of carbamazepine may cause an even greater increase in olanzapine clearance. Fluvoxamine is an inhibitor of CYP1A2 and does decrease the clearance of olanzapine. This results in a 54% increase in the olanzapine Cmaxin female nonsmokers (may be higher in smokers). The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52%. A lower dose of olanzapine should be considered. #References ......................... Aichhorn W, Yazdi K, K, Appl 1999; 726:203-9.

Omeprazole is effective treatment for a number hypersecretory disorders, and effective preoperative prophylaxis (20-40mg PO qd) against aspiration pneumonitis. While there are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnantwomen, omeprazole appears to retain its efficacy during pregnancy. Though it increases human myometrial contractilityin isolated muscle strips, there are no reports of an increasedprevalence of preterm delivery. Omeprazole is advocated to lower gastric pH prior to cesarean section, but the results of the randomized trials are inconsistent, perhaps reflecting dose and route of delivery. Further, it and similar agents require20-30min to take effect. Thus, Bicitra (citric acid/sodium citratesolution), perhaps with metoclopramide to enhance lower esophageal sphincter tone, remain agents of choice for emergentprocedures.Side effects include headache, diarrhea, hepatic dysfunction, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and blood dyscrasias. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether omeprazole crosses the human placenta. Proton pump inhibitors in general, andomeprazole specifically, are not associated with an increased risk of malformations. In the ewe, the F:M ratio approximates 0.5 andis strongly related to the rate of maternal clearance. Rodent studies are generally reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity despite the use of doses higher than those usedclinically. However, embryo and fetal toxicity are noted in some models when multiples of the MRHD are used. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. Omeprazole enters human breast milk, but milk concentrations are less than 10% of the maternal serum level.Thus, the nursing infant is unlikely to ingest a clinicallysignificant amount. #Drug Interactions ................ May prolong the elimination of diazepam, warfarin, and phenytoin, all drugs that are metabolized by oxidation in the liver. There have also been clinical reports of interaction withother drugs metabolized via hepatic CYPs (e.g., benzodiazepines, cyclosporine, disulfiram ). Patients should be monitored to determine if it is necessary to adjust the dose. Because of its profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion, omeprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ampicillin, iron salts, and ketoconazole ). However, antacids were used in the clinical trials with omeprazole. 819Use with clarithromycin increases the plasma levels of omeprazole, 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin. #References .........................

It isunknown whether oseltamivir enters human breast milk. 824#Drug Interactions ................ Information derived from pharmacology and pharmacokinetics studies suggests clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. Clinically important drug interactions involving competition for renal tubular secretion are unlikely due to the known safety marginfor most of these drugs, the elimination characteristics of oseltamivir carboxylate (glomerular filtration and anionic tubular secretion), of these pathways. Probenecid increases oseltamivir by about 2-fold due to a decrease in active anionic tubular secretion in the kidney.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Alcoholism is an often-unrecognized problem during pregnancy that poses a clear hazard to mother and child. Oxazepam has a wide safety range compared to other benzodiazepines. Some also consider oxazepam a second-line agent for the treatment of pruritus during pregnancy, despite thelack of study for this indication. It is highly effective for theshort-term relief of anxiety. Physical and psychologicaldependency is a risk with chronic usage. Side effects include nausea, hepatic dysfunction, jaundice, leukopenia, dizziness, syncope, vertigo, headache, edema, tremor, rash, and lethargy. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Oxazepam crosses the human placenta at a slower rate than diazepam, reaching an F:M ratio during the 1st trimester of 0.5 after 4h.

Oxcarbazepine is of carbamazepine and thus an enzyme-inducing agent. Either a higher dose oral contraceptive or a second method of contraception is recommended. Planned pregnancy and counseling on the importance of folate supplementation and medication adherenceare important. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Maternal levels do decline with advancing gestation, suggesting the need for a dose adjustment.Vitamin K (10mg qd) is recommended for the last 4w of gestationin enzyme-inducing agents such and elevated LFTs. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Oxcarbazepine crosses the human placenta, reaching an F:M ratio approximating unity with the placenta taking an active role in its metabolism. The frequency of neonatalbleeding complications is not increased, calling into question the necessity of vitamin K supplementation. Oxcarbazepine is closely related structurally to carbamazepine, which is considered teratogenic in humans. Polytherapy increases the risk. If feasible, the number of agents used during pregnancy should be reduced. Rodent studies performed at doses analogous to the human demonstrate embryo lethality, IUGR, and a variety ofmalformations (craniofacial, CV, and skeletal). #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Though the concentrations of oxcarbazepine 829and its major metabolites in human breast milk are low, and neonatal concentrations decline despite breastfeeding, periodic monitoring of the infant concentration is suggested by some. #Drug Interactions ................ May inhibit CYP2C19 and induce CYP3A4/5 with potentiallyimportant effects on plasma concentrations of other drugs. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are responsible for the metabolism ofdihydropyridine calcium antagonists and oral contraceptives; co-administration of oxcarbazepine results in a lower plasma concentration of these drugs.Several AEDs that are CYP inducers can to MHD plasma levels by 29-40%. Carbamazepine decreases the MHD concentration by some 40%. Phenobarbital increases mean oxcarbazepine levels by 14% and decreases MHD levels by 25%.Phenytoin levels increase up to 40% when oxcarbazepine is given at doses above 1200mg/d. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of phenytoin may be required. Influences the plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG). The mean AUC values of EE were decreased by 48% in one study and 52% in another study. The mean AUC values of LNG were decreased by 32% in one study and 52% in another study. Thus, use of oxcarbazepine with oral contraceptives may render them less effective; a secondarymethod should be used. The AUC of felodipine was lowered by 28%. Verapamil decreased should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if the benefit justifies the potential perinatal risk. /C15As for most psychotropic drugs, monotherapy and the lowesteffective quantity, given in divided doses to minimize the peaks, can minimize the risks.

Thirty milligrams equal to 10mg morphine. Oxycodone is not intended for use as a prn analgesic. Women have, on average, plasma oxycodone concentrations up to 25% higher than men on a body-weight- adjusted basis. In one RCT, the oxycodone -acetaminophen combination provided superior pain control after cesarean delivery with fewer side effects compared to morphine PCA. Side effects include dependency, hepatotoxicity, seizures, respiratory depression, sedation, N/V, pruritus, rash,dysphoria, and constipation. 834#Fetal Considerations ........... no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of oxycodone in human fetuses. Other drugs in its class readily cross the human placenta. Oxycodone abuse during pregnancy may be associated with neonatal withdrawal. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Oxycodone was detected in the milk of mothers who have taken any dose in a 24h period, with significant correlation betweenmaternal plasma and milk levels (r2=.81). The M:P ratio was 3.2:1. Over the next 48h, the relationship between plasma and milk levels was weaker (r2=.59). Oxycodone levels up to 168ng/ml were detected in breast milk (20% >100ng/ml), though it was detected in only 1/41 infants tested. Maternal oxycodone intake up to 72h post-cesarean section poses only minimal risk to the breastfeeding infant as volume of breastmilk ingested is low during this period. #Drug Interactions ................

It provides similar pain relief with less pruritus compared to morphine when used with epidural analgesia. Oxymorphone is an alternative to morphine administered by PCA after cesarean section, but may be associated with an increase in nausea. Thelevel of sedation is similar.

Use of other CNS depressants, including sedatives, hypnotics,tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids,TCAs, MAOIs, and ethanol, may produce additive CNS depressant effects. The dose of one or both agents should be reduced to 1=2or1=3. Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activitymay result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.

The physiologic role of oxytocin in the stimulation and maintenance of human labor remains unclear. Though the search continues for newoxytocin receptor antagonists, large trials conducted with one antagonist revealed it was at best no better than many of the tocolytic agents already available. Oxytocin is usually effective stimulating rhythmic uterine contractions and is the drug of choice for induction 839and augmentation of labor. In some geographic locales, an OCT is still used to assess placental reserve in the at-risk pregnancy. It is unclear whether routine amniotomy enhances the efficacy of oxytocin. High-dose oxytocin (4.5mIU/min initially, increased by 4.5mIU/min q30min) is associated wi th significantly shorter labors without demonstrable adverse fetal or neonatal effect compared to alow-dose oxytocin (1.5mIU/min initially, increased by 1.5mIU/min q30min) protocol. In VBAC patients, there is a dose-responserelationship between the maximum oxytocin infusion rate and uterine rupture. Added caution is indicated at the higher dosesofoxytocin during a VBAC attempt. Low-dose oxytocin (1-4mIU/ min) is equivalent to misoprostol for cervical ripening. Oxytocin is also important for the management of postpartum bleeding. Oxytocin infused at 80mIU/500ml over 30min for the first 30min postpartum reduces the need for additional uterotonicagents after cesarean delivery compared to an infusion of 10mIU/500ml over 30min at cord clamping. While it is often given (10mIU IV) with the delivery of the anterior shoulder, there is no clinical advantage to its administration then compared to afterplacental delivery for the reduction of 3rd stage hemorrhage. Injection into the umbilical vein after delivery has little impact on the 3rd stage of labor.Side effects include uterine tetany, arrhythmia, uterine rupture, #Fetal Considerations ........... Oxytocin is used only to end pregnancy, and as such poses only labor-associated risks to the fetus. There are no indications for itsuse in the 1st trimester, and animal teratogen studies have not been conducted. Electronic FHR monitoring is indicated for all antepartal infusions. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Endogenous oxytocin is essential for the initiation of lactation, and synthetic oxytocin can aid the establishment of a milk reflex. #Drug Interactions ................ Severe hypertension has been reported when oxytocin was given 3-4h following prophylactic administration anesthesia may modify oxytocin's CV effects so as to produce unexpected results such as hypotension. Maternal sinus bradycardia with abnormal AV rhythms has also been noted when used with cyclopropane. #References ......................... Cahill AG, Stamilio Ferguson JE J Zlatnik FJ.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of pamidronate in pregnant women. The published experience consists of several case reports. In one, pamidronate was employed in the 3rd trimester to treat hypercalcemia secondary to metastatic breast carcinoma. There was no apparent adverse effect. In another, a woman with metastatic breast cancer wastreated at 28w after unsuccessful chemotherapy, deteriorating renal function, frequent contractions, and a calcium level of 17.6mg/dl. Pamidronate dramatically decreased both the calcium levels and the frequency of uterine contractions. In six otherinstances, women with either polyostotic fibrous dysplasia or osteogenesis imperfecta were treated before conception and throughout pregnancy without any apparent adeverse maternal 842or fetal effects. In animal studies, pamidronate inhibits bone resorption at the recommended dose for hypercalcemia apparently without inhibiting bone formation and mineralization. Side effects include N/V, dyspepsia, seizures, hypertension, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, tachycardia, anorexia, fever, confusion, psychosis, pain, and fatigue. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether pamidronate crosses the human placenta. The limited human experience is reassuring. Indeed, pamidronate may represent an ameliorating fetal therapy for congenital osteogenesis imperfecta if there is placental transport.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of pancuronium in pregnant women. However, it has a long clinical experience for cesarean delivery. Pancuronium is approximately 1=3less potent than vecuronium, though its duration is longer at equipotent doses. As compared to vecuronium, pancuronium is also vagolytic with accompanying tachycardia\u2014unwanted in some adults but perhaps desired during fetal transfusion. Magnesium sulfate enhances the neuromuscular blockade, and reversal may be incomplete. Neuromuscular blockade is reversed by anticholinesterase agents such as edrophonium, neostigmine, and pyridostigmine. Side effects include arrhythmia, hypertension, tachycardia, rash, increased salivation, and pruritus. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofpancuronium in human fetuses. There is minimal transport across the human placenta. Pancuronium is often used for fetal paralysis to facilitate intrauterine procedures (0.3-0.6mg IV orIM). Because it increases HR, pancuronium blunts the normal decline in cardiac output after fetal intravascular transfusion. Fetal paralysis modestly reduces oxygen consumption. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether pancuronium enters human breast milk. However, it is unlikely a significant amount would enter thebreast milk given once for the described indications. #Drug Interactions ................ Succinylcholine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking effect and increase its duration of action. If succinylcholine is used first, the pancuronium should be delayed until the patient starts to recover from the succinylcholine -induced neuromuscular blockade. If a small dose of pancuronium is given at least 3min prior to the administration of succinylcholine, in order to reduce 845the incidence and intensity of succinylcholine -induced fasiculations, it may cause respiratory depression in some patients.

Depression is common during and after pregnancy, but typicallygoes unrecognized. Pregnancy is not a reason a priori to discontinue psychotropic drugs. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of paroxetine in pregnant women. About 2=3of women taking SSRIs during pregnancy for major depression must increase their dose to maintain efficacy. Women should not feel compelled to stop paroxetine when they become pregnant if therapy is indeed indicated. If, after receiving appropriateevidence-based information, they decide to stop, it should betapered gradually to avoid the abrupt discontinuation syndrome. There is growing clinical experience with the use of paroxetine for the treatment of postpartum depression. Paroxetine is also effective for the treatment of menopause-associated hot flashes. Side effects include serotonin or withdrawal syndromes, extrapyramidal symptoms, mania, seizures, nausea, diarrhea,headache, somnolence, dizziness, weakness, constipation, tremor,flatulence, anxiety, sweating, decreased libido, blurred vision,appetite changes, and flushing. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Paroxetine crosses the human placenta, achieving a mean F:M ratio approximating 0.5, a value significantly 852lower than that observed with citalopram andfluoxetine. Neonatal withdrawal symptoms are documented. Epidemiologic studies are somewhat mixed and suggest confounding factors are at play. Some larger studies suggest an increase in CVmalformations after 1st trimester exposure to paroxetine. The effect is however small, appears dose-dependent (only abovea daily dose of 25mg) and the most recent large epidemiologicalstudy found no such association. However, the risks may not beonly structural. In one follow-up study, blunted facial-action responses were observed among infants exposed prenatally to SSRIs, whereas both prenatal and postnatal exposure wasassociated with reduced parasympathetic withdrawal andincreased parasympathetic cardiac modulation during recovery after an acute noxious event. Given that postnatal exposure via breast milk is extremely low and altered biobehavioral painreactivity is not associated with levels of maternal reports ofdepression, these findings suggest possible sustained neurobehavioral outcomes beyond the newborn period. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity orIUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Paroxetine is excreted into human breast milk with the highest concentrations in the hind milk. However, the levels are variable, and no breastfed child studied to date has had clinically relevant levels detected, suggesting paroxetine is a good selection for breastfeeding women. #Drug Interactions ................ In a controlled study of healthy volunteers, a single dose ofpimozide (2mg) displayed increases in the pimozide AUC maxof 62% titrated to 60mg daily compared to pimozide alone. Due to the narrow therapeutic index of pimozide and its known ability to prolong the QT interval, concomitant use of pimozide andparoxetine is contraindicated. Based on the paroxetine mechanism of action and the potential for serotonin syndrome (primarily headache, nausea, sweating, and dizziness), caution is advised when using with other drugs oragents that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as tryptophan, triptans, SSRIs, linezolid that is MAOI), lithium, tramadol, or St. John's wort.There may be a pharmacodynamic interaction between paroxetine andwarfarin that causes a bleeding diathesis with unaltered PT. Caution is indicated.Epidemiologic studies of the case-control and cohort design reveal an association between psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and upper GI bleeding. Thus, patientsshould be cautioned about the use of such drugs concurrentlywith paroxetine. Rare post-marketing reports describe patients with weakness,hyperreflexia, and concentrations of paroxetine by approximately 50%. The paroxetine dosage should be guided by clinical effect. paroxetine alone. Since paroxetine exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the results of this study may notaddress the case where the 2 drugs are both being used 853chronically. No initial dosage adjustment of paroxetine is necessary; any subsequent adjustment should be guided by clinical effect. (300mg and 35%, respectively, to paroxetine alone. When a single phenytoin dose (300mg PO /C21) AUC was reduced about 12% compared to phenytoin administered alone. Since both drugs exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics, these studies may not apply where both being used chronically. No initial dosage adjustments are considered necessary when thesedrugs are co-administered.Paroxetine is both metabolized by and inhibits CYP2D6. Co-administration with drugs that caution. In most patients ( >90%), CYP2D6 is saturated early during dosing. (20mg qd) increased PO /C21) C AUC, and t/2 by some 2-, 5-, and 3-fold, respectively. In another study, paroxetine (20mg PO /C21) given to patients stabilized on risperidone increased the plasma risperidone 4-fold, decreased 9-hydroxyrisperidone approximately 10%, and increased the active moiety (the sum of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone) 1.4-fold. The effect of paroxetine on the pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine was evaluated when both drugs were at steady state. In healthy but extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers, paroxetine (20mg qd) C max3- to 4-fold. The dose of atomoxetine may need to be either reduced or initiated at a lower level when given with paroxetine. At steady state, when CYP2D6 is essentially saturated, paroxetine clearance is governed by alternative P450 isozymes that, unlikeCYP2D6, show no evidence of saturation. Due to the risk ofserious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death potentially associated with elevated plasma levels, paroxetine and thioridazine should not be used together. Caution is indicated in the co-administration of TCAs since paroxetine may inhibit TCA metabolism. Plasma TCA concentrations should be monitored, and the dose of TCAreduced, if needed.Because paroxetine is highly bound to plasma protein, use with another drug that is highly protein bound may cause increasedfree concentrations of the other drug, potentially resulting inadverse events. Conversely, adverse effects could result fromdisplacement of paroxetine by other highly bound drugs. Due to the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advisedwhen paroxetine is used with lithium. Increases the AUC(0-24), C max, and C minvalues of procyclidine (5mg PO qd) by 35%, 37%, and 67%, respectively. The dose of procyclidine should be reduced if anticholinergic effects are seen. There are reports of elevated theophylline levels associated with paroxetine. While this interaction has not been formally studied, it is recommended that theophylline levels be monitored when these drugs are used together. Use of fosamprenavir-ritonavir with paroxetine significantly decreased plasma levels of paroxetine. Any dose adjustment should be guided by clinical effect. #References .........................

About 40% of patients experience a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction; treated women shouldbe warned of the possibility and monitored closely for the first 48h. Benzathine penicillin G-penicillin G suspension (Bicillin L-A) 2.4 million U IM is insufficient as sole therapy for group B streptococcal prophylaxis.Side effects include thrombocytopenia, There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Most penicillins cross the human placenta tosome extent. The currently recommended dose of benzathine penicillin G is effective for preventing congenital syphilis in most settings, although some additional study regarding dosemodification is needed. Azithromycin andceftriaxone are potential alternatives for penicillin-allergic women, but there is insufficient data on efficacy, which limits their use in pregnancy. Rodent studies of benzathine penicillin G are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the useof doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Only trace amounts of benzathine penicillin G enter human breast milk. It is generally considered compatiblewith breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Tetracycline, a bacteriostatic antibiotic, may antagonize the bactericidal effect of penicillin, and use of these drugs togethershould be avoided.Use with probenecid increases and prolongs serum penicillin levels by decreasing the apparent volume of distribution and slowing the rate of excretion by competitively inhibiting renal tubular secretion of penicillin. #References Matsuda S.

Procaine penicillin G is a combination of benzylpenicillin with the local anaesthetic agent procaine. It is slowly absorbed after IM administration and hydrolysed to benzylpenicillin and thusused to achieve prolonged but low concentrations of benzylpenicillin. The combination seeks to reduce the pain and discomfort associated with a large IM injection of penicillin.There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Procaine penicillin G may be used in place ofbenzathine penicillin G for the treatment of syphilis, but has no medical advantage.

Barbiturates produce CNS mood alteration ranging from excitation to sedation to hypnosis and deep coma. As a sleep aid, barbiturates are of limited value beyond the short term as they lose effectiveness after 1-2w. There are superior agents that haveless effect on the sleep cycle. There are no adequate reports orwell-controlled studies of pentobarbital in pregnant women. Hypnotic doses do not impair uterine activity during labor.Side effects include addiction, respiratory depression, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, SLE, headache. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Pentobarbital rapidly crosses the human placenta. The highest concentrations are found in placenta, liver, and brain.Its administration during labor can cause neonatal respiratory depression. Preterm infants are particularly susceptible, and resuscitation equipment should be available. Chronic use duringthe 3rd trimester can yield addicted neonates who have anextended withdrawal syndrome. Retrospective, case-control studies suggest a connection between barbiturates and an increased risk of fetal abnormalities. However, there are no suchreports specifically for pentobarbital, and the rodent studies are reassuring. There is a single study suggesting a reduction infertility. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. Only small amounts of pentobarbital enter human breast milk, and it is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Most reports of clinically significant drug interactions withbarbiturates involve phenobarbital. However, the application of these data to other barbiturates may be valid.Barbiturates may induce liver microsomal enzymes, increasing the metabolism and decreasing the anticoagulant response to oral anticoagulants (e.g., acenocoumarol, dicumarol, phenprocoumon , ). Anticoagulant dose adjustments necessary if barbiturates are added or withdrawn. Barbiturates enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids probably through the induction of liver microsomal enzymes.A dose adjustment may be required if barbiturates are added or withdrawn. Phenobarbital may interfere with the oral absorption of griseofulvin. The effect of decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established. It is preferable to avoid their use together. Phenobarbital may shorten the t/2 of doxycycline for as long as 2w after barbiturate dicontinuation, probably through theinduction of liver microsomal enzymes that metabolize doxycycline. The clinical response to doxycycline should be monitored closely if the two drugs are used together. The effect of barbiturates on phenytoin metabolism appears variable. Some note an accelerating effect, while others report no effect. Because the effect is unpredictable, phenytoin and barbiturate blood levels should be monitored more frequently if used together. Valproate andvalproic acid appear to decrease barbiturate metabolism; thus, barbiturate blood levels should be monitored and dose adjustments made as appropriate.Use with other CNS depressants, including other sedatives or hypnotics, antihistamines, tranquilizers, or ethanol, may produce additive depressant effects.MAOIs prolong the effects of barbiturates probably by inhibitingthe metabolism of the barbiturate. Pretreatment with or concurrent use of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism. There are reports of women treated with AEDs (e.g., phenobarbital ) becoming pregnant while taking oral contraceptives. An alternate contraceptive method should be suggested. #References .........................

It is unknown whether perindopril crosses the human placenta. It does cross the rabbit placenta. Other renin-angiotensin system inhibitors cross the humanplacenta, and contrary to initially beliefs, may cause fetal cranial hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible renal IUGR, and PDA beginning with a1st trimester exposure. There is no reason to expect perindopril is different. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether perindopril enters human breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Patients on diuretics, especially those started recently, mayoccasionally experience an excessive reduction of BP afterinitiation of perindopril therapy. Hypotension can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake priorto initiation of perindopril. If diuretics cannot be interrupted, close medical supervision should be provided with the first doseofperindopril, for at least 2h, and until BP has stabilized for another hour.Bioavailability is reduced by diuretics; this is also associatedwith a decrease in plasma ACE inhibition. May increase serum potassium because of its potential to decrease aldosterone production. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g.,amiloride, spironolactone, triamterene ), potassium supplements, or other of increasing serum potassium (e.g., cyclosporine, heparin, indomethacin ) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. They should be used cautiously and the serum potassium monitored frequently.Increased serum lithium and symptoms of lithium toxicity are reported. Caution coupled to frequent monitoring of serumlithium levels is recommended. Use of a diuretic may further increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Animal data suggest the possibility of an interaction withgentamicin. Use caution if both drugs must be used together. #References .........................

Less time is spent in REM during barbiturate-induced sleep compared to normal sleep. Abrupt cessation may triggerincreased dreaming, nightmares, and/or insomnia. Barbiturates provide little analgesia at subanesthetic doses; in fact, they may increase the reaction to painful stimuli. There are no adequatereports or well-controlled studies of phenobarbital in pregnant women. Several investigations indicate clearance is increased and 883that periodic dose adjustment may be necessary. All adjustments should be guided by clinical symptoms. In addition, phenobarbital impacts the a number of liver CYPs. Phenobarbital is not effective for the treatment of cholestasis of pregnancy. Planned pregnancy and counseling before conceptionare crucial. It is important to discuss folic acid supplementation, medication adherence, the risk of teratogenicity, and theimportance of prenatal care.Side effects include respiratory depression, habituation, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, angioedema,megaloblastic urticaria, pain, thrombophlebitis, swelling, and necrosis. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofphenobarbital in human fetuses. Barbiturates readily cross the human placental barrier and are distributed throughout fetaltissues, with highest concentration found in the placenta, fetal liver, and brain. The F:M ratio approximates unity. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in neonates exposed to barbituratesthroughout the 3rd trimester. Case-control studies disagree on whether there is a relationship between barbiturate use and a higher than expected incidence of birth defects (oral clefting andcardiac malformations). Otherwise healthy women attemptingsuicide with barbiturates did not experience an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. Antenatal phenobarbital exposure does not affect the neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants at 18-22mo of age. It also does not reduce the risk of neonatal IVH. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Phenobarbital enters human breast milk, and the magnitude is altered by polypharmacy especially early in breastfeeding.Breastfeeding is controversial because of the potential for slow elimination by some neonates. Infant sedation is possible, and the infant should be observed closely. Serum monitoring may beadvisable if phenobarbital is continued during breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Lowers the plasma levels of oral anticoagulants (e.g.,acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon, warfarin )b y increasing their metabolism and resulting in a lower PT. Patientsstabilized on anticoagulant therapy may require adjustment if barbiturates are added or withdrawn. Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenouscorticosteroids through the induction of liver microsomal enzymes. Patients stabilized on corticosteroid therapy may require a dose adjustment if barbiturates are added or withdrawn.May interfere with the absorption of orally administeredgriseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level. The effect of the decreased blood level on therapeutic response has not beenestablished. It is preferable to avoid co-administration.Shortens the t/2 of doxycycline for as long as 2w after the barbiturate therapy has ended, probably through the induction of liver microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic. The effect of barbiturates on phenytoin metabolism is variable; phenytoin and barbiturate blood levels should be monitored frequently. Valproate andvalproic acid appear to decrease barbiturate metabolism; thus, barbiturate levels should be monitored and the dose adjusted as indicated. Use of other CNS depressants, including other sedatives or hypnotics, antihistamines, tranquilizers, or ethanol, may produceadditive depressant effects.MAOIs inhibit the metabolism of and can prolong the effects of barbiturates. 884May decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism. There are reports of patients treated with AEDs (e.g., phenobarbital ) who became pregnant using oral contraceptives. An alternate contraceptive method should be considered. #References .........................

There is no published experience with phensuximide during pregnancy. Consideration may be given to stopping phensuximide if the severity and frequency of seizures are such they do not pose a serious threat to the patient. However, even minor seizures pose some hazard to the embryo and fetus.

Phentermine is a sympathomimetic similar to amphetamine. It is indicated only for short-term monotherapy, and the associated weight loss is typically modest. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance occur with phentermine and all related drugs. Serious regurgitant disease of the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valvesoccurs in patients taking a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine. The latter was withdrawn from the US market, but it is not definitive which drug was at fault. There are no adequatereports or well-controlled studies of phentermine in pregnant women, and there is probably no indication for its use during either pregnancy or lactation. In one case-control study, the rate of gestational diabetes was significantly greater in the women whotook phentermine andfenfluramine during the 1st trimester. In the guinea pig, mephentermine reduces uterine blood flow. Mephentermine appears as effective as ephedrine for the the treatment of hypotension associated with subarachnoid block.Side effects include hypertension, insomnia, excitation, constipation, diarrhea,and urticaria. 887#Fetal Considerations ...........

It is popular for the prevention of hypotension following neuraxial anesthesia during cesarean delivery especially when ephedrine might be contraindicated (e.g., maternal cardiac disease). There was no difference in the rostral spread of spinalhyperbaric bupivacaine with prophylactic phenylephrine than with ephedrine. However, there may be an unexplained increased incidence of fetal acidosis with ephedrine. Further, there is evidence that longer spinal-delivery intervals increased the risk offetal acidosis developing with ephedrine, but not phenylephrine.

Stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved in most, though there is wide variability with equivalent doses. Patients with unusuallylow levels may be either noncompliant or hypermetabolizers.Unusually high levels can result from hepatic disease, congenitalenzyme deficiency, or other drugs that interfere with metabolism. Clearance is increased during pregnancy, with concentrations declining to half of prepregnancy if the dose is not adjusted. Doseadjustments should be based on clinical symptoms, and not solelyserum drug concentrations. Phenytoin is highly protein-bound, 892and unbound drug levels are less affected than total concentrations. Phenytoin may impair the effect of oral contraceptives, Drug interactions between enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants such as phenytoin and contraceptives are well-documented. Either a higher dose oralcontraceptive or a second contraceptive method is recommended.Planned pregnancy and counseling before conception is crucial, and should include information on the risk of teratogenicity, need for folate supplementation, and the importance ofprenatal care.Side effects include fibrillation coarse facies. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Phenytoin crosses the human placenta apparently by passive diffusion. The risk of major malformations in the offspringof women receiving AEDs is double the general population. Riskfactors include dose and polytherapy. Phenytoin is specifically associated with congenital heart defects and cleft palate. There is evidence that a phenytoin -induced embryonic arrhythmia is one mechanism of teratogenicity. The arrhythmia reflects the ability of phenytoin to inhibit current in a specific potassium channel (I Kr), and may cause embryonic ischemia-reperfusion injury with thegeneration of reactive oxygen species. Exposure to phenytoin in utero can lead to psychomotor delay. Either midface or digit hypoplasia correlates with neurodevelopmental compromise. In vitro, phenytoin causes neuronal cell death. Carbamazepine and topiramate alone did not induce neuronal death, but both drugs exacerbate phenytoin -induced cell death. In contrast, co-treatment with levetiracetam andcarbamazepine does not enhance cell death in the developing brain. Thus, it may be possible to avoidproapoptotic effects, even in polytherapy, by choosing appropriatedrugs. Prior reports of an increased risk of neonatal intracranial hemorrhage after in utero phenytoin exposure due to vitamin K deficiency have not been substantiated. As with most psychotropic drugs, the risks may be minimized by monotherapy and thesmallest effective quantity given in divided doses to minimize the serum peaks. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. The transfer of phenytoin into human breast milk appears relatively low, and it is generally considered safe forbreastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Many drugs may increase or decrease phenytoin levels. Serum level measurements are especially helpful when possible druginteractions are suspected.Drugs that may increase serum levels chronic ethanol abuse, reserpine, andsucralfate. Moban brand of molindone contains calcium that interfere with the absorption of phenytoin. Ingestion times of phenytoin and antacid preparations containing calcium should be staggered in patients with low serum phenytoin levels.

Piperacillin is widely distributed, including therapeutic levels in bone, heart, bile, and CSF during inflammation. It is best studiedduring pregnancy for the treatment of gonorrhea, PPROM, andcesarean section prophylaxis. Piperacillin pharmacokinetics reveal a larger volume of distribution and higher clearance rate duringpregnancy. This suggests higher doses are necessary for effectivetreatment of serious infections in pregnant women near term and in the puerperium. In reference to prophylaxis, no single antibiotic prophylaxis ( ampicillin, cefotetan, piperacillin [\u00b1tazobactam ]) is superior to the other; cost and convenience are the deciding variables. Piperacillin may be given as a single 4g dose at cord clamping with little loss ofefficacy. Several reports support the use of piperacillin (3-4g IV q6h/C272h) to prolong the latency interval between PPROM and the onset of labor. Side effects include thrombocytopenia, seizures, fever, pseudomembranous enterocolitis, interstitial nephritis, neutropenia, hemolytic anemia, prolonged bleeding time, rash, bleeding, hypokalemia, headache, dizziness, fatigue, phlebitis, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated LFTs. #Fetal Considerations ...........

Pneumococcal infection is a leading cause of death and a majorcause of pneumonia, meningitis, and otitis media. Pneumococcal vaccine is a mixture of highly purified capsular polysaccharides from the 23 clinically relevant pneumococcal types accountingfor at least 90% of pneumococcal blood isolates. The antibody induced by the vaccine may persist for as long as 5 years.Susceptible patients at increased risk include HIV-infected women.Side effects include local injection site soreness, erythema and swelling, rash, urticaria, arthritis, arthralgia, serum sickness,adenitis, and fever. 909#Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of pneumococcal vaccine in human fetuses. Stimulated antibodies are transferred across the placenta. While gestational age affectsthe efficiency of antibody transfer, vaccination is efficient andnewborns of treated women have higher titers during the first 6mo to 1y of life. That said, there is insufficient evidence to conclude maternal pneumococcal vaccination will indeed reduceinfant infection. Maternal immunization does not alter theneonatal response to vaccination. Rodent teratogenicity studies have not been performed, though there is no reason to expect an adverse fetal effect. Vaccinated rodents transfer enoughantibody to their offspring to protect against otitis media. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

Pravastatin lowers lipids in two ways. First, it modestly reduces the intracellular pool of cholesterol by the reversible inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, increasing the number of LDL receptors on cell surfaces and enhancing receptor-mediated catabolism and clearance of circulating LDL. Second, pravastatin inhibits LDL production by inhibiting hepatic synthesis of VLDL, the LDLprecursor. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process; discontinuation of pravastatin during pregnancy should have little impact on long-term maternal outcome. Side effects include rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, cholelithiasis, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, CPK or LFTs. Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether pravastatin crosses the 921human placenta. It is lipophilic and should equilibrate between maternal and fetal compartments. Pravastatin inhibits P-glycoprotein and therefore may increase the placental transferof other compounds to the fetus. One recent review of 214pregnancy exposures to statins noted 31 adverse outcomes, including 22 cases with structural defects and 5 fetal deaths. There were two principal categories of recurrent structuraldefects: cerivastatin andlovastatin were associated with 4 CNS defects; simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin were associated with reports of limb deficiencies, including 2 similar complex lower limb defects after simvastatin exposure. There were 2 cases of VACTERL among the limbdeficiency cases. No adverse outcomes were reported after exposure to pravastatin, which is poorly transported across the rodent placenta. These authors concluded that statins may have secondary on sterol-dependent morphogens such asSonic Hedgehog. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. It is unknown whether pravastatin enters human breast milk. Certainly cholesterol and its by-products areimportant components of breast milk. In the absence of furtherstudy, pravastatin should be considered incompatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Itraconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor that also inhibits P- glycoprotein transport) increased the mean AUC and C maxfor pravastatin by factors of 1.7 and 2.5, respectively. The mean t/2 was not affected, suggesting the relatively small increases in C max and AUC were due solely to increased bioavailability rather thana decrease in clearance, consistent with inhibition of P-glycoprotein transport by itraconazole. Cholestyramine andcolestipol use resulted in a 40-50% decrease in the mean AUC of pravastatin. However, when pravastatin was administered 1h before or 4h after cholestyramine or 1h before colestipol and a standard meal, there was no clinically significant decrease in bioavailability or therapeutic effect. A significant difference was observed between the AUCs forpravastatin when given with cimetidine compared to that when administered with antacid.In a crossover study of 20 healthy males given single doses ofpravastatin andgemfibrozil, there was a significant decrease in urinary excretion and protein binding of pravastatin. In addition, there was a significant increase in AUC, C max, and T maxfor the pravastatin metabolite SQ 31,906. Combination therapy recommended. #References .........................

Schistosomiasis affects approximately 40 million women of childbearing age, yet little is known about schistosome-associated morbidity in pregnant women and their offspring. The WHO has recommended treatment of infected pregnant and lactatingwomen. The main complication of helminth infection during pregnancy is anemia. Neurocysticercosis is a cause of first-time convulsions in pregnant patients, and there are several casereports of its successful treatment with praziquantel during pregnancy. Praziquantel has also been used during the puerperium to successfully treat hypersplenism secondary tochronic hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. Recent study documentsthat pregnancy suppresses potentially beneficial boost incytokine responses associated with praziquantel . Side effects include CSF reaction syndrome, malaise, headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, nausea, fever, urticaria, bitter taste,drowsiness, anorexia, sweating, and fever. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is not known whether praziquantel crosses the human placenta. Congenital helminthic infection in humans is exceedingly rare. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doseshigher than those used clinically. However, some studies reportpraziquantel is embryotoxic and may be genotoxic. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Praziquantel enters human breast milk with an M:P ratio approximating 0.25 or a peak milk concentration of0.5mg/ml. However, the mean excretion with the milk in24h approximates 0.0008% of the given dose. Thus, theunsupplemented neonate of a woman treated for tapeworm would ingest less than 1mg of drug given to its mother. #Drug Interactions ................

Unlike many other antihypertensive drugs, the effect of prazosin is closely related to its plasma concentration. The T maxis increased and its elimination t/2 prolonged during pregnancy. Prazosin is a secondary agent for the treatment of preeclamptic hypertension. While as effective as nifedipine, the associated fetal death rate is higher. Prazosin has revolutionized the treatment of severe scorpion stings.Side effects include syncope after the 1st dose, postural hypotension, palpitations, fever, and pruritus. #Fetal Considerations ...........

Prednisolone a metabolite of prednisone. It provides effective relief (10mg PO tid) of severe hyperemesis unresponsive to primary therapy and characterized by at least a 10% weight loss. Dermatologic and ophthalmic applications have been used fordecades during pregnancy without apparent sequelae.Prednisolone is used widely for the treatment of inflammatory/ autoimmune disorders that are common in reproductive-agewomen. Once used for the treatment antiphospholipid syndrome,several trials document a higher loss rate with prednisolone and aspirin than heparin andaspirin. Similarly, the combination of prednisone, aspirin, andprogesterone is no better than enoxaparin alone for the treatment of idiopathic, recurrent miscarriage.Side anxiety, menstrual irregularities,ecchymosis, acne, skin atrophy, impaired wound healing, hypertension, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. The human placenta metabolizes prednisone, reducing fetal exposure to perhaps 10% of the maternal level. 926One study of prenisolone placental transfer noted the same F:M of 0.10. Prednisone is often used as salvage therapy for the treatment of fetal alloimmune thrombocytopenia in fetuses unresponsive to immune globulin infusion. Some authors suggestemotional stress during organogenesis could cause congenital malformations by increasing the level of glucocorticoids. Older epidemiologic studies examined the association of oral cleftingwith corticosteroids exposure and concluded prenatal exposurecarried 6-fold increase in risk for cleft lip with or without cleft palate. IUGR and shortening of the head and mandible were also suggested as sequelae. However, the Collaborative PerinatalProject followed women treated during the 1st trimester. Whilethe number of exposures was limited, no increase in congenital malformations was detected. More recent studies also dismiss the risk of teratogenicity for all malformations except clefting.There is no increase in risk of anomalies when exposure occursafter organogenesis. Women exposed to topical prednisone -like compounds during pregnancy have no significantly increased riskof delivering a child with birth defects. In sum, the evidence thatcorticosteroids are human teratogens is weak, and confined only to cleft lip. Female rats exposed to cortisone in utero exhibit premature vaginal opening. Cortisone accelerates fetal rat intestinal maturation, perhaps explaining why corticosteroidsdecrease the incidence of NEC. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. It is unknown whether prednisolone enters human breast milk. However, long clinical experience suggests prednisolone therapy is compatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Drugs induce liver microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity, may enhance metabolism and require the dose ofprednisolone be increased. Increases activity of both cyclosporine and corticosteroids with concurrent use.Estrogens may decrease the liver metabolism of somecorticosteroids, thus increasing their effect.Ketoconazole decreases the metabolism of some corticosteroids by up to 60%, leading to an increased risk of corticosteroid sideeffects.May decrease the response to warfarin; clotting indices should be monitored closely.Use with aspirin (or other NSAIDs) increases the risk of GI side effects. Aspirin should be used cautiously with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. Salicylate clearance may be increased by corticosteroids. Observe patients closely for hypokalemia if used with potassium-depleting agents (i.e., diuretics, amphotericin B ). Hypokalemia increases the risk of arrhythmia in patients on digitalis glycosides. Use with anticholinesterase agents may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. Anticholinesterase agentsshould be stopped at least 24h before initiating corticosteroidtherapy if possible. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and live or inactivated vaccines.Corticosteroids may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in live, attenuated vaccines. The routine administration of vaccines or toxoids should be deferred untilcorticosteroid therapy is discontinued if possible. Corticosteroidsmay suppress skin test reactions. 927May increase blood glucose concentration, necessitating a dose adjustment agents. #References Category: should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if the benefit justifies the Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, South Africa, Venezuela); disorder, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, TB, osteoporosis, hepatic dysfunction 928#Maternal Considerations ..... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of prednisone in pregnant women. Crohn's disease and other chronic inflammatory diseases often affect reproductive-agewomen. The available data show that women with Crohn'sdisease can expect to conceive successfully, carry to term, and deliver a healthy baby. Control of disease activity before conception and during pregnancy is critical to optimize bothmaternal and fetal health. The pharmacologic therapy duringpregnancy is similar to that for nonpregnant patients. Patients maintained in remission by way of pharmacologic therapy should continue it throughout their pregnancy. Although prednisolone was previously used for the treatment antiphospholipidsyndrome, several trials report the loss rate is higher with prednisolone andaspirin versus heparin andaspirin. Though there are several case series suggesting prednisone is of benefit, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether adjunctive steroid use in HELLP syndrome decreases maternal and perinatal mortality or major maternal and perinatal morbidity. Side effects include adrenal insomnia, menstrualirregularities, ecchymosis, acne, skin atrophy, impaired woundhealing, hypertension, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. The human placenta metabolizes prednisone, reducing fetal exposure to perhaps 10% of the maternal level. Some authors suggest emotional stress during organogenesis could cause congenital malformations by increasing the level of glucocorticoids.Prednisone is used as a rescue therapy for the treatment of fetal alloimmune thrombocytopenia when IVIG has failed.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. It is unknown whether prednisone enters human breast milk. However, most asthma medications, including oralprednisone, are considered compatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Drugs that induce liver enzymes (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin) may increase the clearance of corticosteroids and may require increases in corticosteroid dose to achieve the desired response. Drugs such as troleandomycin andketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of corticosteroids and thus decrease theirclearance. The dose of corticosteroid should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity. 929May increase the clearance of chronic high-dose aspirin, leading to decreased serum salicylate levels or an increased risk of salicylate toxicity when the corticosteroid is withdrawn. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in patients suffering from hypoprothrombinemia. The effect on oral anticoagulants is variable. There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of anticoagulants whengiven concurrently with corticosteroids.

Prilocaine is used in some locales for pudendal nerve block at delivery. Prilocaine causes vascular smooth muscle contraction in in vitro studies, suggesting injection in the region of the uterine artery for a paracervical block may be a risk. Prilocaine is also available solid as a cream with lidocaine. In one RCT, lidocaine-prilocaine cream did not decrease the discomfort associated with amniocentesis. Side effects include light-headedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or 930double vision, vomiting, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression or arrest, vasovagal reaction, and sensations of heat, cold, or numbness. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Prilocaine crosses the human placenta, and after pudendal nerve block achieves an F:M ratio near unity. There are several reports of neonatal methemoglobinemia after prilocaine.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. It is unknown whether prilocaine enters human breast milk. However, considering the indication and dosing, one-time prilocaine use is unlikely to pose a clinically significant risk to the breastfeeding neonate. #Drug Interactions ................ Use of local anesthetic solutions containing epinephrine or NE to patients on an MAOI, TCA, or phenothiazine may produce severe, prolonged hypotension or hypertension. Concurrent use should generally be avoided.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Primaquine is mainly used to treat theP. vivax orP. ovale malaria. Once the parasite has been eliminated from the bloodstream, the remaining hypnozoitesmust be removed from the liver by administering a 14d course ofprimaquine (the so-called radical cure). Primaquine is considered by some to be contraindicated in pregnancy since the G6PD status of the fetus will be unknown. A pregnant womanshould take weekly chloroquine prophylaxis until after delivery when hypnozoite eradication can be initiated. Primaquine is not routinely used to prevent malaria in travelers, and as such is onlyused when no other alternatives exist. It is not licensed for thisuse in the US or UK. Primaquine causes methemoglobinemia in all patients (levels of up to 18% are reported, normal level <1%), but this seldom causes symptoms and is always self-limiting.Dangerous levels of methemoglobinemia only occur in patientswith G6PD effects include anemia, methemoglobinemia, leukopenia, N/V, abdominal pain, headache, pruritus, and vision disturbances. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Primaquine likely crosses the human placenta, as it may be associated with a hemolytic crisis in a G6PD-deficient fetus. Except for the tetracyclines, there is no evidence that at recommended doses any of the antimalarial drugs are teratogenic.Primaquine is generally notrecommended because of its theoretic potential to cause fetal hemolytic anemia. Rodent teratogenicity studies apparently have not been performed. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women.

Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay,Taiwan, PEMA potentiates the effect of phenobarbital. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women, though levels reportedly decline with advancing gestation. Primidone is used mainly to treat complex partial, simple partial, generalizedtonic-clonic, myoclonic, and akinetic seizures. It has been a valuable alternative to propranolol for the treatment of essential tremor. Unlike other AEDs such as carbamazepine andvalproic acid,primidone is rarely used in the treatment of bipolar disorder or any other psychiatric problem. It has occasionally been used to treat long QT syndrome, cerebral palsy, andathetosis. AEDs should not be discontinued in patients to whomthey are given to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life. In individual cases where the severityand frequency of the seizure disorder are such that the removalof medication does not pose a serious threat to the patient, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy, although it cannot be said with anyconfidence that even minor seizures do not pose some hazard to the developing embryo or fetus. Side effects include dyspnea, ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Phenobarbital and PEMA readily crosses the human placenta, and are distributed throughout fetus. Thehighest concentrations are found in the placenta and fetal liverand brain. Withdrawal symptoms may occur in infants exposed to barbiturates throughout the 3rd trimester. Reports suggesting an increased rate of birth defects (oral clefting and cardiacmalformations) in children of drug-treated epileptic women arenot adequate to prove a cause-and-effect relationship, but there does appear to be a clear increased risk of neurologic dysfunction. The likelihood of congenital abnormalities in children exposed in utero tocarbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone is reduced by folic acid supplementation 5-12w from LMP. The majority of mothers onanticonvulsant medication deliver normal infants. Anticonvulsantdrugs should notbe discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life. As for most psychotropic drugs,monotherapy and the lowest effective quantity given in divided doses to minimize the peaks can minimize the fetal risks. It is controversial whether enzyme-inducing drugs such as primidone increase the risk of neonatal bleeding. Though the most recentstudies indicate not, the administration of 1mg vitamin K IM at birth is common. 933#Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. Primidone and its metabolites are excreted into human breast milk and have been associated with neonatal sedation. If breastfeeding continues, the infant should be monitored for possible adverse effects, thedrug given at the lowest effective dose, and breastfeeding avoided at times of peak drug levels. #Drug Interactions ................ Drug interactions between enzyme-inducing AEDs and contraceptives are well documented. Higher dosages of oral contraceptives or a second contraceptive method are recommended for women using an enzyme-inducing AED. #References .........................

Rodent studies arereassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Experience is limited to a single informative case report. A breastfed infant of a 30y-old woman being treated with probenecid andcephalexin for a breast infection developed severe diarrhea and associated symptoms. Milk was collected over a dose interval at steady-state, and concentrations ofprobenecid andcephalexin measured by HPLC. The average concentrations of probenecid andcephalexin in the milk were 964 and 745mcg/L, respectively, corresponding to absolute andrelative infant doses of 145mcg/kg/d and 0.7% for probenecid and 112mcg/kg/d and 0.5% for cephalexin. Neither drug level is such that an effect would be expected. Considering the indicationand dosing, the typically one-time use of probenecid is unlikely to pose a clinically significant risk to the breastfeeding neonate. #Drug Interactions ................ Decreases the renal clearance of many drugs, and as such is usedto elevate plasma concentrations of penicillin or other b-lactams. High plasma concentrations of the other drug may increase the incidence of adverse reactions associated with that drug. Psychiatric disturbances have been reported when combined withpenicillin or other b-lactams. Salicylates and pyrazinamide antagonize the uricosuric action ofprobenecid. May prolong or enhance the action of oral sulfonylureas andthereby increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Patients receiving probenecid require less thiopental for induction of anesthesia. In addition, ketamine andthiopental anesthesia are significantly prolonged in rats receiving probenecid. May increase the mean plasma elimination t/2 of a number of drugs, including acetaminophen, indomethacin, ketoprofen, lorazepam, meclofenamate, naproxen, andrifampin. Although the clinical significance of this observation has not beenestablished, a lower dosage of the drug in question may berequired to produce a therapeutic effect, and increases in dosageof the drug should be made cautiously and in small increments when probenecid is being co-administrated. In animals and in humans, probenecid has been reported to increase plasma concentrations of methotrexate. Falsely high readings for theophylline have been reported in vitro when measured using the Schack and Waxler technique. #References .........................

It may be used alone or incombination with digoxin. All class IA agents should be administered in the hospital under continuous cardiac monitoring due to the potential risk of ventricular arrhythmia. Electrical cardioversion is necessary in all patients who arehemodynamically unstable with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias. In hemodynamically stable patients, initial therapy with ajmaline, procainamide, orlidocaine is indicated. Side effects include depression, diarrhea, dizziness, and elevated LFTs. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. Procainamide crosses the human placenta and is not bound by the placenta. There are numerous case reports of its use as a transplacental agent to treat fetal arrhythmia.

Progesterone is central for reproduction. This section applies only to native hormone and not synthetic compounds, which may differ significantly depending upon their receptor profile (see individual progestogens). Progesterone is used throughout the 1st trimester to provide luteal-phase support for womenundergoing ovulation induction and IVF. Other than those, there are no proved indications for its use during pregnancy. Progesterone administration does not prevent pregnancy loss in women with spontaneous, clinically recognized conceptionsgreater than 7w when the placenta is hormonally functional and the pregnancy no longer corpus luteum dependent. The evidence thatprogesterone is an effective treatment for supposed luteal-phase defects is weak. Recent study suggests the administration of micronized progesterone vaginal gel or cream to women with a sonographically short cervix (10-15mm) between 22 and 24wgestation is associated with a 40% reduction in the incidence of idiopathic preterm birth. While the MFMU Network trial also concluded 17-hydroxy progesterone caproate administered weeklyIM had a similar efficacy in women with at least one prior 942idiopathic preterm birth, a more recent investigation mounted to obtain FDA approval for the vaginal gel failed to reproduce this conclusion. However, in a secondary analysis, these investigators did find a significant reduction in the incidence of idiopathicpreterm birth when treated subjects had a sonographic cervical length at randomization <28mm. This finding is consistent with the finding that pregnant women with a prior idiopathic preterm birth but a normal sonographic cervical length in the currentgestation are notat increased risk for recurrent idiopathic preterm birth.Side effects include menstrual irregularities, amenorrhea, breast tenderness, gain, stroke, thromboembolism, MI, breastcancer, gallbladder disease, cholestatic jaundice, hypertension, headache, acne, hirsutism, galactorrhea, and alopecia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of progesterone in human fetuses. Progestogens differ in their hormonal effects. Masculinization of the female fetus is attributed to some progestogens. The evidence that natural progesterone is a teratogen is weak. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Exogenous progesterone enters human breast milk. The quantity of milk produced correlates with the antenatalprogesterone level. #Drug Interactions ................ Metabolism is inhibited by ketoconazole (50% inhibitory concentration <0.1mM), a known inhibitor of CYP3A4. The clinical relevance of the in vitro findings is unknown. #References ......................... Carp H, Torchinsky E, Parra M, et al; Fetal Medicine Foundation Second Trimester Screening Group.

Promazine is a prototype phenothiazine used with variable success for the treatment of depressive neurosis, alcohol withdrawal, N/V, symptoms of dementia, Tourette's syndrome,Huntington's chorea, and Reye's syndrome.

Side seizures, cerebral edema, amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and dry mouth. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether promazine crosses the human placenta. However, it undergoes placental peroxidation,and the free radicals produced may be one source of fetal toxicity. Older reports suggest a relationship between antenatal promazine and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. In one study, promazine had no effect on fetal CV function of sheep. In a second study performed using a higher dose, promazine caused fetal hypotension and tachycardia, and exacerbated the effect ofumbilical cord compression.

Promethazine has been used for decades in obstetrics to treat N/V, as a sedative, and to relieve apprehension during the latent phase of labor. It is often combined with a narcotic such as meperidine. Promethazine (25mg tid /C23w) is similar to ondansetron but inferior to a short course (3d) of methylprednisolone for the relief of N/V of pregnancy. Promethazine was a frequent component of lytic cocktails used in preeclamptic women to prevent seizures. These cocktails have been abandoned in favor of magnesium sulfate. Initial hopes that promethazine would ameliorate severe Rh alloimmunization have not been substantiated but remain poorly studied. It is not effective for the relief of nausea following thiopentone anesthesia for abortion. Controlled trials do not support the use of promethazine as an adjuvant to reduce postoperative adhesions. It has been used unsuccessfully for the relief of postepidural pruritus associated with morphine injection. Side effects There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether promethazine crosses the human placenta. Human epidemiologic studies are reassuring. The combination of promethazine andmeperidine during labor reduces FHR reactivity. There was no effect on somatic 945development in one study. Transport across the mouse placenta is limited. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. A recent epidemiological study found no adverseoutcomes after an attempted suicide with promethazine. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether promethazine enters human breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ May increase, prolong, or intensify the sedative action of CNSdepressants, such as ethanol, sedative-hypnotics (includingbarbiturates), general anesthetics, narcotics, narcotic analgesics,and tranquilizers. The dose of barbiturates should be reduced by at least 1=2, and the dose of narcotics should be reduced by1=4to 1=2. Excessive amounts of promethazine injection relative to a narcotic may lead to restlessness and motor hyperactivity in thepatient with pain; these symptoms usually disappear with adequate control of the pain.Although reversal of the vasopressor effect of epinephrine has not been reported with promethazine injection, it is recommended thatepinephrine notbe used in case of promethazine injection overdose.Concomitant use with other agents with anticholinergic properties should be undertaken cautiously. Drug interactions, including an increased incidence ofextrapyramidal effects, have been reported between some MAOIsand phenothiazines. Although such a reaction has not been reported with promethazine, the possibility should be considered. 1992; 12:553-76.Horta ML, Morejon LC, da Anaesth 2008; 24:87-96. Safari Z.

Limited study suggests low quantities ofpropafenone enter human breast milk, with an M:P ratio of 0.25 and a theoretic infant dose of 0.1% of the daily maternal dose. #Drug Interactions ................ Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4 mightincrease plasma levels of propafenone. Patients should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted as needed. Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the hydroxylation pathway, making all patients slow metabolizers. There is, as yet, too little information to recommend concomitant use ofpropafenone andquinidine. Use with local anesthetics (i.e., during pacemaker implantations,surgery, or dental use) may increase the risks of CNS side effects.Produces dose-related increases in serum digoxin levels at 450mg/d to 85% at 900mg/d of propafenone without affecting digoxin renal clearance. Digoxin levels should be measured, and the digoxin dosage either reduced or aggressively adjusted when propafenone is started. Increases the propranolol plasma concentration and elimination t/2 with no change in propafenone plasma levels from control. 947Similar observations have been reported with metoprolol. Propafenone appears to inhibit the hydroxylation pathway for the two b-antagonists (just as quinidine inhibits propafenone metabolism). While the therapeutic range for b-blockers is wide, a reduction in dosage may be necessary. Increases the mean steady-state warfarin plasma concentration 39% with a corresponding increase in the PT of some 25%. It is recommended that PT be monitored and the dose of warfarin be adjusted.

Propofol is popular for a variety of procedures including oocyte retrieval and suction curettage. Its administration (1.0mg/kg/h) after cord clamping at cesarean delivery performed under general anesthesia reduces postoperative N/V. In addition, an IV bolus (20mg) decreases pruritus associated with intrathecal morphine. Its clearance, as reflected in the dose required to produce unconsciousness, is unaltered during early pregnancy. It has a direct inhibitory effect on uterine contractions, caused at least inpart by interfering with calcium transport. In small series ofpatients whose anesthesia for cesarean delivery was induced and maintained with propofol, there were no differences in neonatal outcome as compared to more commonly administered anesthetic include reactions. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Propofol crosses the human placenta in a time-dependent manner, at a rate dependent on uterine andumbilical blood flows. The maternal albumin level also impacts on the extent of transfer. Reports of F:M ratio range widely from 0.35 to 1.0. Propofol infusions adequate for conscious sedation during cesarean section seem to have no adverse neonatal effects.In the ewe, a 6mg/kg IV bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 0.4mg/kg/min produced an AUC and C maxof 8.6 mg/h/ml and 9.5mg/ml, respectively, higher than those of the fetus (1.6mg/h/ml and 1.19 mg/ml, respectively). The mean t/2 was 0.5h in the eweand 1.1h in the fetus, suggesting accumulation may occur. While rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity, breastfed pups of treated mothers have a highermortality rate. Propofol transiently blocks NMDA receptors that lead to an increase in neuronal apoptosis in rodents. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... A small amount of propofol is excreted in human breast milk. However, considering the indications, prior exposure to propofol is not likely to pose a significant risk to the breastfeedingneonate. #Drug Interactions ................

Propranolol is used extensively during pregnancy for the treatment of maternal hypertension, arrhythmia, and migraine headache, and is generally considered safe. It is also used acutely to provide relief of symptoms from thyrotoxicosis andpheochromocytoma. Several studies suggest the administration of 952propranolol (2mg IV) to nulliparas who require oxytocin augmentation for dysfunctional labor reduces the likelihood of a cesarean delivery by almost1=2. The studies of propranolol as an oral hypotensive are small. It appears as effective as a- methyldopa, and is often coupled with other hypotensive agents such as hydralazine. Side effects include CHF, arrhythmia, bronchospasm, bradycardia, dizziness, insomnia, weakness, fatigue, hallucinations, constipation, pharyngitis, rash, alopecia, and agranulocytosis. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Propranolol crosses the human placenta, but has no effect on either uterine or umbilical Doppler-determinedresistances in chronically hypertensive women. There are casereports of its use, usually with digoxin, for the treatment of SVT, though there are superior agents. The impact of propranolol on the fetus of women with chronic hypertension is unclear.Frequently combined with another agent, the risk of IUGR isreportedly increased. However, IUGR is more common when the maternal pressure is suboptimally controlled and in need of higher doses. The most recent information suggests the increasedrisk of IUGR reflects excessive maternal bblockade adequate to decrease maternal cardiac output. Other neonatal sequelae reported include bradycardia and hypoglycemia. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Less than 1% of the maternal dose of propranolol enters human breast milk; it should not pose a risk to the breastfedneonate. #Drug Interactions ................ Use with ACEIs can cause hypotension, particularly in the settingof acute MI. Use with some ACEIs increases bronchial hyperreactivity.May antagonize the hypotension. Propafenone negative inotropic and b-blocking properties that can be additive to those of propranolol. Quinidine increases the propranolol concentration and produces greater degrees of clinical bblockade and may cause postural hypotension.Disopyramide has been associated with severe bradycardia, asystole, and heart failure when administered with propranolol. The negative chronotropic properties of amiodarone may be additive to those seen with propranolol. Reduces the clearance of lidocaine. Caution should be exercised when patients receiving a b-blocker are administered a calcium channel-blocking drug with negativeinotropic and/or chronotropic effects. Both agents may depressmyocardial contractility or AV conduction.Patients on long-term therapy may experience uncontrolled hypertension if given epinephrine as a consequence of unopposed a-receptor stimulation. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine should be closely observed for hypotension, marked bradycardia, vertigo, hypotensive effects TCAs may be exacerbatedwhen administered with b-blockers. Hypotension and cardiac arrest have been reported when used with haloperidol. 953NSAIDs blunt the antihypertensive effect. May increase the concentration of warfarin. Monitor the PT closely.Aluminum hydroxide gel greatly reduces intestinal absorption. Ethanol slows the rate of absorption. Phenytoin, phenobarbitone, and rifampin accelerate propranolol clearance. Chlorpromazine increases the plasma levels of both drugs. Cimetidine decreases the hepatic metabolism of propranolol, delaying elimination and increasing blood levels.Theophylline is reduced. ......................... 2:341-50.

Hyperthyroidism occurs in approximately 1 in every 1000-2000 pregnancies. Propylthiouracil historically was the agent of choice for the treatment of Graves' disease during pregnancy because it was believed to have less potential for fetal/neonatal hypothyrodism, to cross the placenta, or to enter breast milk, andto be less teratogenic than methimazole or carbimazole. None of these reasons has been validated in recent studies. There are no 954adequate reports or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Methimazole is equally effective. It is generally recommended that the minimum dose of propylthiouracil necessary to control the maternal thyroid be used. However, this is a poor approachas the maternal dosage correlates poorly with the newborn TSH. Clearly, dosing must be individualized to achieve optimal maternal and fetal outcome. Women with a history of Graves'disease in the past should be screened for the continued presenceof thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin even if they previously received definitive treatment, since fetal hyperthyroidism is still likely when positive. Fetal treatment may be necessary, and thepatient should be appropriately evaluated in a fetal care unit.Side no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Propylthiouracil crosses the human placenta. The fetuses of mothers treated with propylthiouracil are rarely euthyroid, and a fetal evaluation is mandatory.

Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small or quite large (8-fold increasein plasma AUC of the TCA).Certain drugs inhibit CYP2D6 and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. A patient who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of theseinhibiting drugs.

Severe anemia is a cause of maternal morbidity in endemic areas, and treatment leads to resolution. HIV infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of malaria.Pyrimethamine has a long history of use during pregnancy, especially for the treatment of primary toxoplasmosis andmalaria. Recent study suggests the use of intermittent preventativetherapy in endemic areas.Side effects include aplastic anemia, erythemamultiforme, N/V, abdominal pain, dizziness, malaise, diarrhea,rash, fever, dry mouth, and increased skin pigmentation. #Fetal Considerations ........... Pyrimethamine crosses the human placenta with about 30% efficiency. While it has been long used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis during pregnancy, several recent studies conclude that antenatal therapy does not alter outcome, perhaps becausefetal infection has already occurred. Other studies suggestpyrimethamine does not reduce transmission, but rather the sequelae of infection. Further research is required to define therole of prenatal screening and therapy. In contrast, the treatment 964of pregnant women (in combination with sulfadoxine) in malaria-endemic areas is cost-effective, reducing the risk of prematurity and IUGR secondary to placental malaria. In rodents, pyrimethamine is associated with embryotoxicity and IUGR. Pyrimethamine was associated with an increased risk of cleft palate, micrognathia, and clubfoot in pigs. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Pyrimethamine is excreted into human breast milk in low concentrations. It is estimated the breastfed neonatewould ingest less than 10% of the maternal dose over 48h. #Drug Interactions ................ Concomitant use of other antifolic drugs or agents associated with myelosuppression, including sulfonamides or agents (e.g., methotrexate ), may increase the risk of bone marrow suppression. If signs of folate deficiency develop,pyrimethamine should be discontinued. Folinic acid should be administered until normal hematopoiesis is restored. Mild hepatotoxicity has been reported in some patients also given lorazepam. #References ......................... Foulon W, Villena Obstet Gynecol 1999; 180:410-5.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Quetiapine crosses the human placenta, achieving an F:M ratio of about 0.25. Only about 4% of the maternal dose istransferred across the isolated cotyledon. The pregnancy outcomesof women who contacted a teratogen information service afterexposure to quetiapine appeared normal. Rodent studies are mostly reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity despitethe use of doses higher than those used clinically. Embryotoxicityand IUGR were noted at the highest doses. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Small amounts of quetiapine are excreted into human breast milk (but in one series only 50% of women had detectable levels in their milk). Detailed kinetics studies are scarce. In one report, the average milk concentration was 41mcg/L, the M:P ratio (measured using the average concentrationsduring the elimination phase) was 0.29, and the relative infant dose was 0.09% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose (7273mcg/ kg/d). The infant plasma concentration of 1.4mcg/L was some 6%of the corresponding maternal plasma concentration. No adverseeffects were noted in the infant. #Drug Interactions ................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of quinapril in pregnant women. In general, ACEIs should be avoided during pregnancy. The lowest effective dose should beused when quinapril is required for BP control during pregnancy. Side effects include angioedema, hypotension, renal failure, cough, dizziness, no published experience in human fetuses. Quinapril likely crosses the human placenta like other ACEIs. As a group,adverse fetal effects are reported across gestation. In contrast toconclusions based on earlier data, adverse fetal effects occur even after 1st trimester exposure to ACEIs, for which the relative risk is 2.7. Exposure is associated with CV and CNS disorders. Laterexposure is associated and PDA. The mechanism of renal dysfunction is likely related to fetal hypotension and prolonged decreased glomerularfiltration. There is inadequate study to determine whether the response to quinapril is typical of this group. The one published rodent study is reassuring. If oligohydramnios is detected, quinapril should be discontinued unless lifesaving for the mother. Antenatal surveillance should be initiated (e.g., BPP) if the fetus is potentially viable. Oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has irreversible injury. Neonates exposed in utero to ACEIs should be observed closely for hypotension, oliguria, andhyperkalemia. If oliguria occurs despite adequate BP and renal perfusion, exchange transfusion or peritoneal dialysis may be required. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Quinapril enters human breast milk with an M/P ratio of 0.12. No drug is detected more than 4h aftermaternal ingestion. It is unlikely the breastfed neonate would ingest clinically relevant amounts. #Drug Interactions ................ As with other ACEIs, patients on diuretics (especially those recently begun) occasionally may experience an excessive reduction of BP after starting quinapril. The risk of hypotension can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or cautiously increasing salt intake prior to beginning quinapril. May attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics andincrease serum potassium even when used alone. Potassiumsupplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes should beused cautiously and with appropriate serum monitoring if diuretics (e.g., ). Tetracycline absorption by 1=3, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril tablets. Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported. These drugs should be used together with caution and frequent measurements of serum lithium. #References .........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofquinidine in pregnant women. All class IA agents should be administered with continuous cardiac monitoring in the hospital because of the risk of ventricular arrhythmia (torsades de pointes). Quinidine is a stereoisomer of quinine. It has a long record of safety during pregnancy, and is generally well tolerated. The clearance of quinidine is apparently unaffected by pregnancy. In women with severe P. falciparum malaria and hyperparasitemia, IV quinidine is often coupled with exchange transfusion, resulting in the clearing of the parasitemia and highsurvival rates. Therapeutic levels of quinidine inhibit pseudocholinesterase activity in pregnant women by 60-70%, necessitating caution if succinylcholine is to be used intraoperatively. Side effects include QT interval prolongation, torsades de pointes, AV block, cardiac arrest, dyspepsia, headache, fatigue, chest pain, blurred vision,rash, abnormal ECG, insomnia, tremor, and tinnitus. 969#Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Quinidine crosses the human placenta, reaching an F:M ratio approaching unity over time. In vitro , it causes a dose-dependent relaxation of placental arteries and veins.Quinidine has been used successfully to correct fetal SVT and reverse hydrops. Elimination of maternal parasitemia does notnecessarily mean elimination from the placenta. Rodentteratogenicity studies have not been performed. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Quinidine is excreted into human milk with an M:P ratio near unity. It is estimated that the unsupplementedneonate would ingest 1.2mg/kg/d, or 1% of the total maternal daily dose. This is below the therapeutic dose prescribed to infants. Neonatal kinetics have not been studied. #Drug Interactions ................ Renal elimination is decreased by drugs that alkalinize the urine (carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate, thiazide diuretics). Levels are increased by use with amiodarone orcimetidine. Very rarely, levels are decreased by use with nifedipine. Hepatic elimination may be accelerated by use with drugs thatinduce CYP3A4 (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin ). Levels given, perhaps because of CYP3A4 metabolic pathway competition.Hepatic clearance is significantly reduced, with correspondingincreases in serum levels and t/2, by verapamil. Slows digoxin elimination and reduces the apparent volume of distribution. As a result, serum digoxin levels may double, requiring a decrease in the digoxin dose. Serum levels ofdigitoxin are also increased when used with quinidine, although the effect appears smaller.Potentiates the anticoagulatory action of warfarin, and the anticoagulant dosage may need to be reduced.Therapeutic serum levels of quinidine inhibit the action of CYP2D6, effectively converting extensive metabolizers into poormetabolizers. Caution must be exercised when quinidine is prescribed together with drugs metabolized by CYP2D6.Increases serum levels of procainamide. Increases serum haloperidol levels. Perhaps because both are metabolized by CYP3A4, co-administration slows the metabolism of nifedipine. Interactions calcium channel blockers (e.g.,felodipine, nicardipine, nimodipine ) have not been reported, but are all dependent upon CYP3A4 for metabolism.Quinidine's anticholinergic, vasodilating, and negative inotropic actions may be additive to those of other drugs with these effects,and antagonistic to those of drugs with cholinergic,vasoconstricting, and positive inotropic effects. For example,when quinidine andverapamil are used in doses that are each well tolerated as monotherapy, hypotension due to additiveperipheral ablockade addition, in vitro addition of quinidine to serum from pregnant women reduces the activity of pseudocholinesterase. Diltiazem significantly decreases the clearance and increases the t/2 ofquinidine, butquinidine does not alter the kinetics of diltiazem. Grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of quinidine to 3-hydroxyquinidine and should be avoided. 970A decrease in dietary salt intake may lead to an increase in quinidine. 1999; JJ, Smith BE.

Treatment dramatically reduces those risks. Quinine is used extensively in developing countries for the treatment of malaria during pregnancy. Its metabolismand clearance are unaltered by pregnancy. It is one of a limited number of drugs used where multidrug-resistant P. falciparum is endemic. However, quinine has a higher treatment failure rate than chloroquine. Quinine toxicity is associated with abortion. Side effects include cinchonism, hemolysis, prolonged QT interval, edema, mydriasis. 971#Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Quinine crosses the placenta, achieving an F:M ratio of 0.32 \u00b1 0.14. The risks of pregnancy loss, IUGR, ormalformation are unchanged after 1st trimester exposure formalaria treatment. Congenital malformations reported in the human were associated with large doses (up to 30g) taken to trigger abortion. In about half of these reports, the abnormalitywas deafness related to auditory nerve hypoplasia. Otherabnormalities reported included limb anomalies, visceral defects, and visual changes. Teratogenic effects are observed in rabbits and guinea pigs but not mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys.Congenital malaria is rare, but elimination of the maternalparasitemia does not guarantee elimination from the placenta. Quinine is used for the treatment of neonatal malaria. Considering the kinetics of placental transport, fetal toxicity seems a low probability at recommended doses. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Quinine enters human breast milk, achieving an M:P ratio of 0.31 (range 0.11-0.53). The total daily dose ingested by the unsupplemented neonate is between 1 and 3mg/d. There are no reports of toxicity in breastfed newborns. #Drug Interactions ................ Antacids containing aluminum and/or magnesium may delay or decrease absorption and should be avoided. The oral clearance of quinine decreases and the mean elimination t/2 increases when given with cimetidine but not with ranitidine. Should quinine be given with an H 2-receptor blocker, ranitidine is preferred over cimetidine. Ketoconazole increases the mean quinine AUC by 45% and lowered oral clearance by 31%. Patients should be monitored closely for adverse reactions. Erythromycin inhibits the metabolism of quinine in vitro and is thus likely to increase plasma quinine concentrations. It shouldbe avoided. Rifampin lowers the quinine AUC by 75%. Therefore the use of rifampin with quinine should be avoided. Tetracycline increases the mean plasma quinine concentrations by 2-fold. Patients should be monitored closely for adverse reactions.Troleandomycin increases the AUC by 87%, lowering oral clearance by 45%. Troleandomycin use should be avoided. Urinary alkalinizing agents may increase plasma quinine concentrations. Has the potential to inhibit the metabolism of drugs that aresubstrates of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, as well as inhibit the biliaryexcretion of drugs such as digoxin. Increases the plasma C maxand AUC of 104%, 81%, ,but not phenytoin. If use with carbamazepine or phenobarbital cannot be avoided, frequent monitoring of the anticonvulsant drug concentrations is recommended. Patientsshould also be monitored closely for adverse reactions associatedwith these anticonvulsants. Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and quinine plasma concentrations.Elevated plasma astemizole was reported in a subject who experienced torsades de pointes after receiving 3 doses of quinine for nocturnal leg cramps concomitantly with chronic astemizole. The use of quinine with astemizole and other also be avoided. 972Decreased the metabolism of desipramine in patients who were extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers, but had no effect in patients who were poor CYP2D6 metabolizers. Although clinical drug interaction studies have not been conducted, antimalarial doses ofquinine may inhibit the metabolism of other drugs substrates digoxin concentrations should be closely monitored, and the digoxin dose adjusted, as necessary.Increased the mefloquine AUC by 22% and significantly prolonged the QTc interval. The concomitant administration ofmefloquine andquinine may produce ECG abnormalities (including QTc prolongation) and may increase the risk ofseizures.Cinchona alkaloids such as quinine have the potential to depress hepatic enzyme synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation pathway proteins and enhance the action of warfarin and other oral anticoagulants. Quinine may also interfere with the anticoagulant effect of heparin. Thus, the PT, PTT, or INR should be closely monitored. Quinine may produce an elevated value for urinary 17-ketogenic steroids when the Zimmerman method is used. #References .........................

The vaccine hasbeen used successfully during pregnancy, and pregnant womenrespond immunologically at least as well as nonpregnant women. 976The reported adverse reaction rate is similar in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Side effects include anaphylaxis, paralysis, and muscular sclerosis. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of rabies vaccine in human fetuses. Fetal rabies is reported. It is likely the IgG antibody produced in response to the vaccine crosses the placenta. It is not known whether transfer provides any levelof perinatal protection. In one trial, intrauterine growth and pregnancy outcome were normal in women vaccinated for postexposure prophylaxis. There were no adverse vaccine effectsreported in over 250 pregnancies. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether rabies vaccine enters human breast milk. It is likely the antibodies produced in response to the vaccine areexcreted into the milk. It is generally accepted that the woman can resume breastfeeding once the vaccination series has begun. #Drug Interactions ................ Corticosteroids, other immunosuppressive agents, antimalarials,and immunosuppressive illnesses interfere with the development of active immunity after vaccination, and may diminish theprotective efficacy of the vaccine. Preexposure prophylaxis shouldbe administered to such persons with the understanding their immune response may be inadequate. Immunosuppressive agents should not be administered duringpostexposure therapy unless essential for the treatment of otherconditions. When rabies postexposure prophylaxis is administered to persons receiving corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapy, or who are immunosuppressed, it is important thata serum sample be tested for rabies antibody to ensure that an acceptable antibody response has been induced. Rabies immune globulin must not be administered at more than the recommended dose, since the response to activeimmunization may be impaired. #References .........................

More recently, they were shown to decrease the progression of nephropathy in normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

There is no published experience in human fetuses. Ramipril likely crosses the human placenta as similar agents do. Transferwas described as low in one rodent study. In contrast toconclusions based on earlier data, adverse fetal effects occur even after 1st trimester exposure to ACEIs, for which the relative risk is 2.7. Exposure is associated with CV and CNS disorders.No such increase is seen with other classes of antihypertensiveagents. Later exposure is associated with cranial hypoplasia, anuria, reversible irreversible renal failure, death, IUGR, and PDA. The mechanism of renal 979dysfunction is likely related to fetal hypotension associated with prolonged decreased glomerular filtration. There is inadequate study to decide whether ramipril is typical of ACEIs. However, the one published rodent study is reassuring. If oligohydramnios is detected, ramipril should be discontinued unless lifesaving for the mother. Antenatal surveillance should be initiated (e.g., BPP)if the fetus is potentially viable. Oligohydramnios may not appearuntil after the fetus has irreversible injury. Neonates exposed in utero to ACEIs should be observed closely for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria occurs despite adequatepressure and renal perfusion, exchange transfusion or peritonealdialysis may be required. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

Use with NSAIDs has been associated with worsening of renalfailure and an increased serum potassium.May be associated with hypotension when used with diuretics, especially if the diuretic was recently intiated. The possibility can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasingthe salt intake prior to initiation of ramipril. May attenuate potassium loss spironolactone, triamterene increase the risk of hyperkalemia. The patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACEIs during therapy with lithium.

In a pilot study, remifentanil provided superior pain relief to laboring women when givenby PCA compared to IM meperidine. However, remifentanil is difficult to titer in clinical practice, and produces high levels ofsedation and excess rates of maternal oxygen desaturation. It is more often used as a supplement to neuraxial anesthesia during cesarean delivery.Side effects include apnea, ventricular arrhythmia, bradycardia, hypotension, dependency, seizures, shivering, fever, pruritus, placenta, achieving an F:M ratio approximating 0.5. Mean clearance approximates 93 ml/min/kg.Thus, while remifentanil crosses the placenta, it appears to be rapidly metabolized, redistributed, or both. Neonatal sedation isreported.

The hypoglycemic action of oral blood glucose-lowering agentsmay be potentiated by certain drugs, including b-adrenergic blocking agents, chloramphenicol, coumarins, MAOIs, NSAIDs and other drugs that are highly protein bound, probenecid, salicylates, and sulfonamides. The patient should be observedclosely for hypoglycemia. When such drugs are withdrawn, thepatient should be observed closely for loss of glycemic control.

Patient or medical error is the most common cause of failed prophylaxis.Anti-D human immunoglobulin has been in clinical use for morethan 30y. Its assessment is based more on experience than on well-designed comparative trials, but is estimated to have reduced perinatal mortality by about 10,000 cases/y in the US alone.A meta-analysis of 6 trials involving more than 10,000 womendemonstrated efficacy of prophylaxis after delivery of aR h o(D)-positive infant to a Rh o(D)-negative woman, reducing sensitization from 10% to 1.5%. The addition of antenatal prophylaxis reduces the rate of sensitization further, down to <0.5%. However, the optimal dosing regimen and route of administration remain unclear. Some data favor the use of Rho(D) immune globulin after abortion, as it appears to reduce immunization rates from about 3-4% to 0.4%. Rho(D) immune globulin is also likely effective antenatally in circumstances or procedures carrying a risk of maternal exposure to fetal RBCs,although this has not been proved in comparative trials. 987Criteria for an Rh-incompatible pregnancy requiring treatment includes: mother o(D)-positive and direct antiglobulin negative. It is generally recommended that Rho(D) immune globulin should be administered to all nonsensitized Rh/C0women after spontaneous or induced abortion, ruptured tubal pregnancy,chorionic sampling, amniocentesis, abdominal trauma, orany occurrence unless the fetus isknown to be Rh o(D)-negative. However, there is minimal evidence that administering Rh immune globulin for 1st trimester vaginal bleeding prevents maternal sensitization or development ofhemolytic disease of the newborn. The practice is based on expertopinion and extrapolation from experience with fetomaternal hemorrhage in late pregnancy. Its use for 1st trimester bleeding is not evidence-based. If Rh o(D) immune globulin is given antenatally, it is essential the mother receive another dose afterdelivery of a Rh o(D)-positive infant. If the father is known and Rho(D)-negative, Rho(D) immune globulin is unnecessary. Rho(D) immune globulin should be given within 72h of delivery or abortion (spontaneous or iatrogenic). Passively acquired anti- Rho(D) may be detected after delivery following antenatal treatment; however, the woman should be treated again postpartum if the neonate is Rh o(D)-positive. One 300mcg vial or syringe is sufficient to prevent maternal sensitization if the transferred fetal PRBC volume is <15ml (30ml whole blood). More than one vial or syringe of Rho(D) immune globulin must be given when the fetomaternal hemorrhage >15ml PRBCs or 30ml whole blood. The number vials required is calculated bytaking the volume of PRBCs determined by an approved laboratory assay, divided by 2 to get the volume of packed fetalRBCs in the maternal blood, and dividing that number by 15 to get the number of syringes or vials. More recently, it has been suggested that Rh o(D) immune globulin might be helpful in women with ITP unresponsive to corticosteroids and nonspecifictypes of immune globulin. Side effects include injection site reaction and fever. #Fetal Considerations ........... There is no evidence of fetal harm after extensive clinical experience. Babies born of women given Rho(D) immune globulin antepartum may have a weakly positive antiglobulin test at birth. There is no credible evidence that the risk of autismis increased by antenatal exposure. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Rh o(D) immune globulin is excreted into human breast milk, but the amount of intact antibody detectable in the neonate is too low to cause clinically relevant hemolysis. #Drug Interactions ................ Other antibodies contained in Rho(D) immune globulin may interfere with the response to live virus vaccines such as measles,mumps, polio, or rubella. Therefore, immunization with live vaccines should not be given within 3mo. #References ......................... Bowman JM, 24:487-9. 988Maayan-Metzger A, Schwartz T, Sulkes J, P.

Hepatitis C is a growing problem worldwide. Perhaps1=3of patients with HIV also have hepatitis C. Liver disease due to chronic HCV infection is now the 2nd leading cause of death in some HIV-infected populations. It is the most common cause of chronic liver disease and liver transplantation. The application of bloodproduct screening has virtually eliminated transfusion-related viraltransmission. As a result, maternal-fetal transmission is now one of the most important modes of transmission. HCV transmission is 2- to 4-fold higher in women co-infected with HIV. Cesareandelivery has not been shown to decrease perinatal transmission. The published experience with ribavirin during pregnancy is limited to case reports. No adverse effects are reported. Considering the risk of viral transmission to the perinate is increased by co-infection, itseems likely future trials will address treatment of hepatitis C in HIV-infected pregnant women. The CDC does not recommend ribavirin for postexposure prophylaxis. Patients with chronic hepatitis whose therapy can be delayed should not be treated untilcontrolled studies are available. However, women exposed to ribavirin inadvertently during pregnancy may be encouraged to continue pregnancy. In patients with acute hepatitis C during pregnancy, the use of ribavirin therapy should be considered with close monitoring. The Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry was initiated in January 2004. 989Side effects include hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, marrow suppression, MI, suicidal ideation, N/V, autoimmune disorders, pulmonary toxicity, pancreatitis, and loss of concentration. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether ribavirin crosses the human placenta. There are only limited case reports of its use duringpregnancy. Rodent studies reveal an increased prevalence of limb,eye, and brain defects. The incidence and severity is proportionalto drug dose. Teratogenicity was not seen at doses approximating the recommended human dose. Ribavirin is often used in the pediatric population for the treatment of RSV. The prevalence of hepatitis C in children is between 0.05% and 0.4%. The majormode of acquisition has shifted from parenteral to maternal-infant transmission. While the actual rate of maternal-infant transmission is low, HIV increases the rate of transmission. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether ribavirin enters human breast milk. Ribavirin is toxic to lactating rats and their offspring. #Drug Interactions ................ Use with didanosine is not recommended. There are reports of fatal hepatic failure, as well as peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis,and symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis.May antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of stavudine and zidovudine against HIV. Therefore, use with either of these drugs should be undertaken with caution.In Study NR15961 among chronic HCV/HIV co-infected cirrhotic patients receiving hepatic (some fatal) was observed. Patients receiving Pegasys/Copegus and NRTIsshould be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities.Physicians should refer to prescribing information for the respective NRTIs for guidance regarding toxicity management. In Study NR15961, use with zidovudine was associated with severe neutropenia (ANC <500) and severe anemia (Hb <8g/dl) more frequently than similar patients not receiving 2001; a teratogen in rodents; there is inadequate experience to conclude it is or is not a teratogen in humans.

Riboflavin is an important nutrient contained in virtually all multivitamin supplements. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the maternal concentration of riboflavin does not decline during normal, unsupplemented pregnancy. However, maternal supplementation does generate supraphysiologic leve ls. Epidemiologic studies suggest multivitamin supplementation dur ing the pregnancy of HIV-infected women improves maternal weight gain. Side effects include bright yellow urine. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Riboflavin is actively transported across the human placenta with a transfer index (clearanceriboflavin :clearance L-glucose) in the isolated cotelydon of 3.4 \u00b1 0.95. Observational studies note a positive relationshipbetween maternal riboflavin levels and fetal size. This finding also applies to women who abuse tobacco. There is no substantativeevidence riboflavin is a teratogen, though epidemiological study suggests low intake may be associated with congenital heartdisease. In some animal models, riboflavin supplementation reduces of NTDs. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Riboflavin is excreted into human breast milk, and the concentration is proportional to the maternal concentration.Women who do not drink milk are more likely to have lowconcentrations of riboflavin in their breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................

There is no experience with rifabutin during pregnancy. In healthy nonpregnant women, rifabutin andrifampin significantly increase the clearance of ethinyl estradiol, suggesting women who use low-dose oral contraceptives should either switch to a higher dose or use abackup contraceptive method while taking rifabutin.

Rifampin has also been reported to affect the acetylation of isoniazid. When rifabutin was compared with rifampin in a study with 8 healthy normal volunteers, rifabutin appeared to be a less potent enzyme inducer than rifampin.

Untreated TB poses a significant threat to the mother, fetus, and family. A 3-drug regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide is recommended for the initial 2mo treatment phase. All pregnant women taking isoniazid should also take pyridoxine 993to reduce the chance of a 'chemical' hepatitis. The CDC recommends that either streptomycin orethambutol be added during the initial treatment unless the likelihood of isoniazid resistance is low. However, streptomycin is contraindicated in pregnancy. Ciprofloxacin has the best safety profile of second- line drugs for the treatment of drug-resistant TB. After the initialphase, treatment is continued with rifampin andisoniazid for 4mo, or longer if the sputum or culture is positive, resistantorganisms are present, or patient is HIV positive. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of rifampin in pregnant women. A long clinical experience suggests pregnancy does not increase the risk of an adverse effect. Rifampin may cause hemorrhage in the mother and neonate when administered during the 3rd trimester. Treatment with vitamin K may be indicated. Rifampin impairs the effectiveness of OCPs. Women using a low- dose OCP should consider a higher dose preparation or a backup method of contraception. Side effects include renal failure, shock, leukopenia, elevated LFTs, interstitial dizziness, abdominal pruritus, rash, dyspnea, ataxia, visual changes, and urticaria. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Rifampin crosses the human placenta, but the kinetics have not been detailed. There is no substantative evidence of teratogenicity in humans. Rifampin does cross the rodent placenta, and is teratogenic at oral doses 15-25 /C2the MRHD, affecting bone, spine, and palate, depending upon thespecies. Congenital TB does occur on occasion, especially inassociation with miliary TB. Rifampin is used to treat children in the first few months of life. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Only trace amounts of rifampin are excreted into human breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ May accelerate the metabolism of (sulfonylureas),oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives, progestins,quinine, tacrolimus, TCAs (e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline ), theophylline, andzidovudine. It may be necessary to adjust the dosages of these drugs.Women using oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptivesshould be advised to change to non-hormonal methods of birthcontrol. May increase the requirements for coumarin-type anticoagulant drugs. It is recommended that a PT or INR be performedfrequently. Ketoconazole andrifampin decrease the serum concentrations of both. Enalapril decreases concentrations of enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril. Dosage adjustments are to be based on the patient's clinical response. 994Antacid use may reduce the absorption of rifampin. The daily dose of rifampin should be given at least 1h before the antacid. Probenecid and cotrimoxazole may increase the blood level of rifampin. The potential for hepatotoxicity is increased when use with either halothane orisoniazid. Their combined use should be avoided. Monitor the patient closely for hepatotoxicity if isoniazid must be used. #References ......................... Bothamley G. Drug Saf 2001; 24:553-65. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Pregnant women suffered a higher mortality rate during the influenza pandemics of the last century and should be vaccinated prior to each influenza season. Prophylaxis is not a substitute for vaccination, although it is an important adjunct.Rimantadine is 70-90% effective in preventing influenza A. When used for prophylaxis, antiviral agents can prevent illness while permitting subclinical infection and the genesis of protective antibodies. Rimantadine reduces the duration of the illness if administered within 2d of symptom onset should anunprotected woman contract influenza A. To reduce the emergence of antiviral drug-resistant viruses, rimantadine therapy is discontinued as soon as clinically warranted, typically after 3-5d, or within 24-48h from resolution of signs andsymptoms. There is no published experience with rimantadine in pregnant women.Side effects include CHF, AV block, bronchospasm, seizures, N/V, insomnia, dizziness, anorexia, dry mouth, abdominal pain, nervousness, and fatigue. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether rimantadine crosses the human placenta. It does cross the rodent placenta and is initiallyconcentrated in the fetal liver. The elimination t/2 is less than 3h.Rodent studies are generally reassuring, revealing no evidence ofteratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. Embryo and maternal toxicity occur at the highest doses. There is also an increase in pup death during the first 2-4dpostpartum, and decreased fertility of the F 1generation. Rimantadine has not been tested in children under 1y. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknownwhether rimantadine enters human breast milk. Rimantadine is concentrated in rat milk in a dose-dependent fashion, achievingtwice plasma levels 2-3h after dosing.

Side effects include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, menstrual irregularities, hypotension, extrapyramidal signs, tardive dyskinesia, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, insomnia, headache, anxiety, rhinitis, constipation, N/V, diarrhea, dyspepsia, dizziness, tachycardia,somnolence, increased REM sleep, and hyperprolactinemia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. It is unknown whether risperidone crosses the human placenta. The pregnancy outcomes of women who contacted ateratogen information service and the manufacturer's data after exposure to risperidone appeared normal. It does cross the rodent placenta. Rodent studies are generally reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higherthan those used clinically. The observed increased neonatal mortality may relate to either the drug or maternal toxicity. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Risperidone enters human breast milk. In one woman taking 6mg PO qd, the peak milk levels of risperidone and its active metabolite were 12mcg/L and 40mcg/L, respectively. Thus, the estimated infant dose is 7.8mcg/kg/d, or 4.3% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose. There are case reports of its use in breastfeeding women without apparent adverse effect. #Drug Interactions ................ Given the primary CNS effects of risperidone, apply caution when using other centrally acting drugs or ethanol.May enhance the hypotensive effects of other hypotensive agents.May antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Chronic administration of clozapine with risperidone may decrease the clearance of risperidone. Carbamazepine may decrease the plasma concentrations ofrisperidone and its pharmacologically active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone by about 50%. Plasma concentrations 1000ofcarbamazepine did not appear to be affected. Use with other known enzyme inducers (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin) may cause similar decreases, which could lower the therapeutic efficacy of risperidone. Patients should be monitored closely during the first 4-8w. On discontinuation of carbamazepine or other hepatic enzyme inducers, the dose of risperidone should be re-evaluated. Fluoxetine andparoxetine, which inhibit CYP2D6, increase the plasma concentration of risperidone 2.5- to 2.8-fold and 3- to 9-fold, respectively. In addition, paroxetine lowered the concentration of 9-hydroxyrisperidone an average of 13%. Wheneither fluoxetine orparoxetine is initiated or discontinued, the dose of risperidone should be re-evaluated. May increase the peak valproate C maxby as much should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if the benefit justifies the potential risk. Ritodrine \u2014(No longer marketed in the US.)

There is no tocolytic agent known to change pregnancy outcome short of allowing corticosteroid administration. Ritodrine decreases the intensity and frequency of uterine contractions, but does not alter in a clinically relevant fashion the 1001gestational age at delivery compared to placebo. Though the first drug approved as a tocolytic in the US, it was withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer. It is inferior to either nifedipine or atosiban in terms of both delivery delay and maternal morbidity. Ritodrine produces an immediate dose-related elevation of HR with maximum mean increase of 19-40bpm.The pulse pressure widens, the average systolic pressure increases4.0mmHg, and the average diastolic pressure decreases12.3mmHg. IV infusion transiently elevates glucose, insulin, and free fatty acids, while serum potassium declines. Maternal pulse rate and BP and FHR should be closely monitored. Theeffectiveness of parenteral ritodrine for tocolysis is limited to short-range prolongation of gestation. The effectiveness of maintenance tocolytic therapy with oral ritodrine is not proved. Maternal signs and symptoms of pulmonary edema should be sought constantly. A persistent tachycardia ( >140bpm) may be a sign of impending pulmonary edema. Occult cardiac disease may be unmasked by ritodrine. If the patient complains of chest pain or tightness of chest, the drug should be temporarily discontinued. A baseline ECG is not cost-effective. Ritodrine has also been used to facilitate external version of a breech fetus.Side effects include pulmonary edema, agranulocytosis, hypotension, palpitations, tachycardia, N/V, flushing, and chest pain. #Fetal Considerations ........... Ritodrine crosses the human placenta. There is no evidence of teratogenicity in humans. Rodent studies are reassuring.It has been suggested that ritodrine and other b-mimetics might promote fetal growth. This hypothesis cannot be confirmed. Ritodrine increases the FHR and left cardiac output, and has been used to treat fetal complete heart block. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience with ritodrine in pregnancy. However, considering the indication and clearance, it is unlikely the breastfed neonate would ingest clinically relevant amounts. #Drug Interactions ................ Corticosteroids may enhance the risk of pulmonary edema.

There are few well-controlled studies of ritonavir in pregnant women. Published cohort studies and case reports do not suggest an increased risk of an adverse outcome during pregnancy. Many commonly used drugs alter the clearance of ritonavir. The patient should be questioned closely about concurrent drug use before prescribing.Side effects include seizures, diabetes mellitus, and rash. Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Placental transport of ritonavir is very low; most umbilical cord samples studied are below the level of detection.Limited transfer for most protease inhibitors reflects both their 1003high degree of plasma protein binding and their backward transport by P-glycoprotein in the placenta. Rodent studies are generally reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically.Combination therapy may enhance toxicity. Maternal toxicity from high doses leads to embryo toxicity. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. It is unknown whether ritonavir enters human breast milk. Breastfeeding is contraindicated in HIV-infectednursing women where formula is available to reduce the risk ofneonatal transmission. #Drug Interactions ................ Inhibits CYP3A; agents that are extensively metabolized byCYP3A and have high first pass metabolism are especiallysusceptible to large increases in their AUC ( >3-fold). It also inhibits CYP2D6 to a lesser extent. Use with CYP2D6 substrates may result in increases in the AUC (up to 2-fold) of the other agent, possibly requiring a dose reduction. Ritonavir can also induce CYP3A and other enzymes, including glucuronosyl transferase, CYP1A2, and possibly CYP2C9. a-Adrenergic antagonists such as alfuzosin are contraindicated due the potential for serious and/or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.Significant decreases in plasma concentrations of antifungals such asvoriconazole may lead to a loss of antifungal activity and contraindicated. methylergonovine ) and/or life-threatening acute ergot toxicitycharacterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities andother tissues including the CNS. Herbal products such as St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to ritonavir or to this class of protease inhibitors. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as lovastatin and simvastatin increase the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Use with lovastatin andsimvastatin is not recommended. Use the lowest possible dose of atorvastatin with careful monitoring or, alternatively, consider an HMG-CoAreductase inhibitor such as pravastatin orfluvastatin. Sedative-hypnotics such as midazolam andtriazolam are contraindicated due to the potential for serious and/or life-threatening sedation or respiratory depression. Ritonavir increases the concentrations of buspirone, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, andzolpidem. A dose decrease indinavir concentration (decreases C maxand increases Cmin) and saquinavir concentration (increases AUC, C max, and Cmin).

Further dose reduction may be necessary. Decreases the concentration of ritonavir, potentially leading to a loss of virologic response. Alternate antimycobacterial agents such asrifabutin should be considered. Decreases atovaquone levels; an increase in the atovaquone dose may be needed.Increases quinine levels, possibly requiring a dose reduction of quinine.Increases the concentrations of the b-blockers metoprolol and timolol and the calcium channel blockers diltiazem, nifedipine, andverapamil. Caution and clinical monitoring of patients are recommended. A dose decrease of these drugs may be needed. Decreases theophylline levels, possibly requiring an increased dose of theophylline. May increase digoxin levels. Caution should be exercised with appropriate monitoring of serum digoxin levels. Increases sildenafil ,tadalafil , and vardenafil concentrations. Use with sildenafil requires special caution as the AUC may increase more than 10-fold and result in an increase in adverse events, including hypotension, syncope, visual changes, and prolonged erection. The starting dose should not, in any case, exceed 25mg in a 48h period. The tadalafil dose should not exceed 10mg every 72h. The dose of vardenafil should not exceed 2.5mg every 72h. Increases the levels of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, andsirolimus . Therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended.May increase the plasma levels of fluticasone, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations. Use with fluticasone is not recommended unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Decreases methadone concentration, possibly requiring a lower dose. Increases the concentrations of perphenazine, risperidone, and thioridazine. A dose decrease may be needed.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of rocuronium in pregnant women, though it has been used for cesarean delivery as part of rapid-sequence general anesthesia inpatients who have a contraindication to succinylcholine (e.g., suspected malignant hyperthermia, upper-motor neuron lesion).However, the manufacturer notes that tracheal intubation can be problematic 60sec after administration, and does not recommend 1008its use (i.e., replacing succinylcholine ) for rapid-sequence induction of general anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Rocuronium neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged by magnesium sulfate infusion or in the postpartum period if dosing is based on total rather than lean body weight.Side effects include arrhythmia, bronchospasm, hypotension, hypertension, and injection site pain. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. Rocuronium crosses the human placenta. In women undergoing rapid-sequence induction of general anesthesia, the F:M ratio approximates 0.18 at delivery. No clinical sequelae are noted.Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically, assuming the mother was properly oxygenated. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. However, considering the indication and dosing, limited use of rocuronium is unlikely to pose a clinically significant risk to the breastfeeding neonate. #Drug Interactions ................ If used after succinylcholine, it should not be given until recovery from the succinylcholine is observed. The median duration of action of rocuronium 0.6mg/kg administered after a 1mg/kg dose of succinylcholine when T 1returned to 75% of control was 36min (range 14-57, n = 12) vs. 28min(17-51, n = 12) without succinylcholine. Use of inhalation anesthetics enhances the activity of other blocking agents ( enflurane >isoflurane > halothane ).Isoflurane andenflurane may also prolong the duration of action of the initial and maintenance doses ofrocuronium and decrease the average dose of rocuronium required by 40% compared to opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia. In one study, use of enflurane in 10 patients resulted in a 20% increase in mean clinical duration of the initial intubating dose, and a 37% increase in the duration of subsequent maintenance doses, when compared to 10 patients under opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygenanesthesia. The duration of maintenance doses was affected to agreater extent, increasing by 30-50% under either enflurane or isoflurane anesthesia. Potentiation by these agents is also observed with respect to theinfusion rates of rocuronium required to maintain approximately 95% neuromuscular block. Under isoflurane andenflurane anesthesia, the infusion by approximately 40%compared to opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia. The medianspontaneous recovery time (from 25% to 75% of control T 1) is not affected by halothane, but is prolonged by enflurane (15% longer) and isoflurane longer). Reversal-induced neuromuscular block is minimally affected by anesthetic technique. In 2 of 4 patients receiving chronic anticonvulsant therapy, apparent resistance to the effects of rocuronium was observed in the form of diminished magnitude of neuromuscular block, orshortened clinical duration. As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs, use with carbamazepine or phenytoin shortens the duration of neuromuscular blockade and may require a higher infusion rate due to the developmentof resistance to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Drugs that may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action ofnondepolarizing agents such as rocuronium include may occur when injecting quinidine during the recovery from other muscle relaxants. Magnesium sulfate administered for the management of preeclampsia or preterm labor may enhance neuromuscular blockade. #References RR, Seem EH.

Because of its lack of platelet effects, rofecoxib is not a substitute for aspirin for CV prophylaxis. It is no more effective than diclofenac andibuprofen for the relief of mild to moderate pain when used at maximal doses. Further, it only modestly reduces the risk of GI reactions (1.3% vs. 1.8% after 1y of treatment). There are no adequate reports or well-controlledstudies of rofecoxib in pregnant women. Though rofecoxib inhibits spontaneous contractions of isolated rat myometrium at lower concentrations than indomethacin, it has no effect on either the onset or duration of labor in rodents. 1010Side effects include GI bleeding or ulcer, esophagitis, bronchospasm, hypertension, CHF, MI, hepatotoxicity, renal anemia, blood dyscrasias, epigastric pain, N/V, edema, dyspepsia, fatigue, and dizziness. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Rofecoxib crosses the human placenta. Fetal levels are dependent on maternal, as NSAID agents are not metabolizedby the fetal kidney. Similar to other NSAIDs, rofecoxib is associated with oligohydramnios and constriction of the ductusarteriosus. The latter reverses with cessation, and the long-termimpact of in utero ductal constriction on the otherwise healthyfetus is currently unknown. Rodent studies are generally reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically.Embryotoxicity was noted at higher doses. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Rofecoxib (25mg) was given to 6 women at weaning. Blood and milk were sampled up to 72h postdose. The median (range)M:P ratio and infant ''dose'' were 0.25 (0.16-0.32) and 2.1% (1.8-3.2%), respectively. Thus, the use of rofecoxib during breastfeeding is unlikely to pose harm based on the low transfer into human milk. #Drug Interactions ................ NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACEIs.Use with low-dose aspirin may result in an increased rate of GI ulceration or other complications.Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. NSAIDs may increase plasma lithium levels and reduce renal lithium clearance. Patients should be observed carefully for signs oflithium toxicity. Use with rifampin , a potent inducer of hepatic metabolism, produced an approximate 50% decrease in rofecoxib plasma levels. A starting daily dose of 25mg of rofecoxib should be considered for the treatment of osteoarthritis when used with potent inducers of hepatic metabolism. Increases the plasma theophylline concentrations (AUC (0-8))b y 38-60% in healthy subjects. Adequate monitoring of theophylline plasma levels should be considered when rofecoxib is initiated or changed in patients receiving theophylline. This suggests that rofecoxib is a modest inhibitor of CYP1A2. Therefore, there is a potential for an interaction with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g., amitriptyline, tacrine, zileuton ). Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in thefirst few days after initiating or changing rofecoxib therapy, in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents. #References ......................... Gardiner SJ, Co withdrew rofecoxib from the worldwide market in 2004 after evidence emerged from several trials of anincreased risk of CV death 1011/C15Health care practitioners are urged to report any prenatal exposure to rofecoxib by calling the manufacturer's Pregnancy Registry (1-800-986-8999). /C15There are numerous alternative agents on the market.

There is no published experience with ropinirole during pregnancy. Side effects include somnolence, atrial fibrillation, syncope, hypotension, N/V, hallucinations, dizziness, fatigue, dyspepsia,malaise, edema, chest or abdominal pain, sweating, pharyngitis,anorexia, and visual changes. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether ropinirole crosses the human placenta. Rodent teratogenicity studies reveal IUGR anddigit abnormalities at doses that are multiples of the MRHD. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether ropinirole enters human breast milk. Ropinirole inhibits prolactin secretion in humans and could interfere with establishment of the milk reflex. #Drug Interactions ................ CYP1A2 is the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of ropinirole. An adjustment of the ropinirole dose may be required if therapy with a known potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 is stopped or started.Oral administration of ropinirole increased the mean steady-state C maxoflevodopa by 20%, but its AUC was unaffected. Use with ciprofloxacin, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, increased the ropinirole AUC on average, and C maxby 60%. analysis studies reveal that estrogens (mainly estradiol ) reduce the oral clearance of ropinirole by1=3. However, a dose adjustment may not be needed for ropinirole because patients must be carefully titrated with ropinirole to tolerance or adequate effect. A dose adjustment may be required if the estrogen therapy is stopped or started. Since ropinirole is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness ofropinirole. Patients with major psychotic disorders treated with neuroleptics should only be treated with dopamine agonists if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. 1012#References .........................

Rosiglitazone may be used alone or in combination with metformin or a sulfonylurea. The short-term use of rosiglitazone andclomiphene is more efficacious than metformin and clomiphene for ovulation induction in women with clomiphene - resistant PCOS. Improved glucose control may also lead to ovulation in premenopausal, anovulatory women and increase therisk of an unplanned pregnancy. Paradoxically, it may interfere with ovulation in spontaneously cycling women. Concern that rosiglitazone may increase the risk of adverse cardiac events remains controversial. The published experience with rosiglitazone during pregnancy is limited to case reports and small series. Side effects include hepatotoxicity, hepatitis, elevated LFTs, anemia, CHF, URI, fluid retention, edema, headache, weight gain, and hypoglycemia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Rosiglitazone crosses the human placenta. In a study of women undergoing elective abortion, drug transfer increased after 10w, achieving roughly a 2:1 M:F concentration gradient. Minimal amounts of rosiglitazone in AF suggest fetal metabolism. In another study employing the dual perfusedisolated placental cotelydon, the clearance indices for low and high concentrations of rosiglitazone were 0.14 \u00b1 0.04 and 0.20 \u00b1 0.08, suggesting the drug crosses the placenta at a relatively low rate. Fetal accumulation occurred in only 1/5 placentas at 16.4ng/ml (5%) for an 8mg dose placentas ranging from 0 to 74ng/ml (5% to 8%) at higher concentrations.Rodent studies are generally reassuring, revealing no evidence ofteratogenicity despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. High doses were associated with fetal losses and IUGR, possibly reflecting sustained hypoglycemia. 1013#Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether rosiglitazone enters human breast milk. It is excreted into rat milk. #Drug Interactions ................

Therubella virus vaccine produces a modified, noncommunicable rubella infection in susceptible persons. Vaccine-induced immunity persists for at least 10y withoutsignificant decline. Vaccinating susceptible women confersindividual protection against rubella during a subsequent pregnancy, thus preventing congenital rubella. Yet, only about half the world's countries vaccinate for rubella. Outbreakscontinue to occur in countries with national immunizationprograms, typically involving women born in other countries. 1014Perhaps the most convenient time to vaccinate is immediately postpartum while the patient is still hospitalized. In that instance, conception should be delayed 1mo. Unfortunately, the opportunity is often missed because of physician/hospitaloversight. Rubella susceptibility should be confirmed serologically before vaccinating. Side effects include injection site reaction, mild regional lymphadenopathy, urticaria, rash, malaise, sore throat, thrombocytopenia. #Fetal Considerations ........... Rubella vaccine virus has been found in the products of conception in women undergoing termination and in the offspring of vaccinated women. Similar to natural viral infections, newborns may shed virus for an extended time.The manufacturer reports that in over 700 women inadvertentlyvaccinated within 3mo before or after conception, no newborn had stigmas of congenital rubella syndrome. Pregnancy termination is not recommended solely because of inadvertentvaccination. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Rubella vaccine virus is excreted into human breast milk, andneonatal infection is reported. However, the risk is generallyconsidered small and immunization not a reason to avoid breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................

Asthma is estimated to affect up to 4% of pregnancies. For pregnant women with persistent asthma, inhaled cromolyn is generally considered the first-line therapy, followed by inhaled budesonide if symptoms worsen. Salmeterol is a long-acting b-adrenergic agonist. It also is a potent inhibitor of mast cell release of histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D 2. Systemic levels of salmeterol are low or undetectable after inhalation. It has also been used for the treatment of altitude sickness. There are no published trials of its use during pregnancy, and recommendations are based on ''expert'' opinion. It is typically used as a secondary agent.Side effects include angioedema, tremor, and nervousness. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether salmeterol crosses the human placenta. Transfer across the rat placenta is low.Considering the low systemic levels achieved and the poor placental transport, it is unlikely the fetus is exposed to a clinically relevant concentration. When given orally at doses50-100 /C2greater than those inhaled, salmeterol is associated with cleft palate and abnormal ossification. These studies do not seem relevant to clinical practice. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience with salmeterol in breastfeeding women. However, considering the dose and route, it is unlikely the breastfed neonate would ingest clinically relevant amounts.The transfer into rodent milk is limited. #Drug Interactions ................ MAOIs or TCAs may potentiate the CV actions of salmeterol; use with extreme caution if the patient is being treated with orwithin 2w of these agents.b-Adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of b-agonists, but may also produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Patients with asthma shouldnot normally be treated with b-blockers. Under certain circumstances (e.g., as prophylaxis after MI), there may be no 1016acceptable alternative to the b-adrenergic blocker. In this setting, cardioselective b-blockers can be considered, although they should be administered with caution. ECG changes and/or hypokalemia secondary to non-potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by b-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the b-agonist is exceeded. #References .........................

Unlike aspirin, salsalate does not inhibit platelet aggregation, and there is no increase in GI bleeding over placebo. There is no published experience during pregnancy. Side effects include hepatic or nephrotoxicity, Reye's syndrome, N/V, epigastric pain, fatigue, rash, and dizziness. #Fetal Considerations ........... There is no published experience in human fetuses. It is unknownwhether salsalate crosses the human placenta. Salsalate and salicylic acid are teratogenic and embryocidal in rats when given in doses 4-5/C2 the usual human dose; teratogenicity is not seen when given at twice the usual human dose. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

Salicylic acid, the primary metabolite, reaches an M:P ratio approximating unity. 1017#Drug Interactions ................ Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of drugs used to treat gout. Aspirin and other salicylates will be additive to salsalate and may lead to salicylate toxicity. Drugs and foods that raise urine pH will increase renal clearance and urinary excretion of salicylic acid, thus lowering plasma levels; acidifying drugs or foods will decrease urinary excretionand increase plasma levels.Use with anticoagulant drugs may predispose to systemic bleeding. May enhance the hypoglycemic effect of sulfonylurea oralantidiabetic drugs.Salicylate competes with a number of drugs for published experience in lactation. #Summary ...........................

Saquinavir \u2014(Fortovase; Invirase) International Brand Name\u2014 Fortovase (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Israel, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Uruguay, Venezuela) #Drug Class .......................... Antivirals; Protease PO (Fortovase) within ..... Saquinavir is well-tolerated during pregnancy and is part of several treatment regimens. Its clearance is increased by pregnancy, and the usually recommended dose may be inadequate. Ritonavir significantly increases saquinavir concentration, and the combination during pregnancy may have some advantage. Side effects include N/V, diarrhea, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, peripheral neuropathy, headache, buccal dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and eczema. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Saquinavir, like many protease inhibitors, does not significantly cross the human placenta probably because ofreverse placental P-glycoprotein transport whose expression 1018it enhances. Unbound concentrations of saquinavir are likely to be substantially lower in umbilical cord than maternal plasma. It is unlikely to pose a significant risk to the fetus. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether saquinavir enters human breast milk. Breastfeeding is contraindicated in HIV-infected nursing womenwhere formula is available to reduce the risk of neonatal transmission. #Drug Interactions ................ The metabolism of saquinavir is mediated by CYP3A4 (90% of the hepatic metabolism) and it is a substrate for P-glycoprotein(Pgp). Drugs that affect CYP3A4 and/or Pgp may modify the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir. Similarly, saquinavir might also modify the pharmacokinetics of other drugs that are substratesfor CYP3A4 or Pgp. Drugs that should not (e.g., dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, may serious acute ergot toxicity characterized by peripheralvasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues.Garlic capsules decrease saquinavir plasma levels and should not be used while taking saquinavir as the sole protease inhibitor. Cisapride is contraindicated due to the potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias.Rifampin decreases the concentration of saquinavir and should be avoided if possible.Herbal products such as St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may lead to the loss of virologic response and possible resistancetosaquinavir or to this class of protease inhibitors. Sedative-hypnotic agents (e.g., midazolam, triazolam ) may result in prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression An alteration in the dose or regimen may be necessary when used with: NNRTIs (e.g., delavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine ), which may decrease saquinavir levels. Saquinavir not be given as the inhibitor.HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., bid with nelfinavir 1250mg bid results in adequate drug concentrations of both protease inhibitors. The lopinavir/ ritonavir coformulated capsule increases saquinavir. Increases the antiarrhythmic effects of lidocaine; monitor the levels. May increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin; monitor the INR. Anticonvulsant drugs phenobarbital, saquinavir. Use with caution.Clarithromycin increases saquinavir andclarithromycin levels. No dose adjustment is required when the two drugs are co-administered for <7-10d and there is normal renal function. However, the clarithromycin dose should be reduced by 50% in patients with CrCl 30-60ml/min, and by 75% if <30ml/min. Ketoconazole and potentially itraconazole increase the saquinavir level with no change in the ketoconazole concentration. 1019Rifabutin andrifampin decrease the saquinavir level while increasing the rifabutin level. Saquinavir should not be given as the sole protease inhibitor. Increases the levels of benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, clorazepate, ), perhaps necessitating a decrease in the benzodiazepine dose.Increases in the dose of the calcium channel blocker.Dexamethasone decreases the saquinavir level, perhaps decreasing efficacy.Increases the level and effect of some HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g., atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin ). Use the lowest possible dose with careful monitoring or consider other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g., fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin rapamycin, tacrolimus ). The dose of methadone may need to be increased. Alternative or additional contraceptive measures should be usedwhen estrogen-based oral contraceptives and saquinavir are inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil, the levels of TCAs such as amitriptyline andimipramine . concentration monitoring is recommended. #References .........................

Scopolamine differs only quantitatively in antimuscarinic actions from atropine. It is ineffective for the prevention of postoperative N/V. At one time popular for ''twilight sleep'' during labor, scopolamine has appropriately fallen out of favor. A recent study suggests it is effective in reducing the duration of the first stageof labor, and was not associated with any obvious adverseoutcomes. It may reduce the post-cesarean section N/V associatedwith epidural morphine, but with an increase in drowsiness and dry mouth. Scopolamine is rapidly cleared, but there is no significant relationship between HR changes, sedative effects, andantisialagogue effects and serum concentration. Side effects include narrow-angle glaucoma, drowsiness, blurred vision, disorientation, dizziness, dilated pupils, hallucinations, confusion, psychosis, bronchospasm, respiratory depression, rash,muscle weakness, and red eyes. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Scopolamine rapidly crosses the human placenta and may cause tachycardia and decreased beat-to-beat and long- term variability. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doseshigher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Scopolamine enters human breast milk, but the kinetics remain to be elucidated. The long clinical experience is reassuring. #Drug Interactions ................ Other drugs that have weak antimuscarinic activity (e.g., certain antihistamines, meperidine, phenothiazines, TCAs) may effects of antimuscarinic and magnesium trisillicate-containing antacidsdecrease the absorption of some antimuscarinic drugs and maydo so with all of them. 1022Scopolamine should be used with care in patients taking drugs, including ethanol, capable of causing CNS effects. Special attention should be given to drugs having anticholinergic properties, such as belladonna alkaloids, antihistamines (including meclizine ), and antidepressants. Scopolamine may decrease the absorption of oral medications because of decreased gastric motility and delayed gastricemptying. #References ......................... Ayromlooi J, P.

Barbiturates are dangerous drugs, with a narrow therapeutic index between the level required for sedation and that causing coma and death. Secobarbital is used by patients to self-treat the unpleasant effects of illicit stimulants, to reduce anxiety, and toget ''high.'' It is physiologically addicting if taken in high doses for 1mo or more, and the abstinence syndrome can be life- threatening. There are no adequate reports or well-controlledstudies of secobarbital in pregnant women. As a short-acting agent, secobarbital was used for decades as a short-term sleeping aid for pregnant women. Unfortunately, the sleep produced is notrestful, characterized by a low percentage of REM stage. Hypnoticdoses of barbiturates do not impair uterine activity significantlyduring labor. Anesthetic doses of barbiturates decrease the force and frequency of uterine contractions. 1023Side effects include respiratory depression, dependency, hepatotoxicity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, angioedema, lethargy, and drowsiness. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is likely secobarbital rapidly crosses the human placenta. There is no substantative evidence secobarbital is a human teratogen. Administration during labor may cause respiratory depression in the newborn. Premature infants are particularly susceptible to the depressant effects of barbiturates. Withdrawal symptoms occur in infants of women who receivesecobarbital throughout the 3rd trimester. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. Smallamounts of secobarbital are excreted into human breast milk, but its occasional use is generally considered compatible withbreastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Most reports of significant drug interactions with the barbiturateshave involved phenobarbital. The application of these data to other barbiturates appears valid.Barbiturates induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting inincreased phenprocoumon, warfarin ). Patients on anticoagulant therapy may require a dose adjustment if barbiturates are added orwithdrawn.Barbiturates may enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids. Patients on corticosteroid therapy may require a dose adjustment if barbiturates are added or withdrawn.Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of oral griseofulvin. It is preferable to avoid concomitant administration. Shortens the t/2 of doxycycline for as long as 2w after barbituratetherapy is discontinued.The effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin appears to be variable.Sodium valproate andvalproic acid increase secobarbital blood levels; thus, secobarbital levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dose adjustments made. Use of other CNS depressants, including other sedatives or hypnotics, antihistamines, tranquilizers, or ethanol, may produceadditive depressant effects. MAOIs prolong the effects of barbiturates, probably because metabolism of the barbiturate is inhibited.May decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism. There have been reports of patients treated with AEDs (e.g., phenobarbital ) who become pregnant while taking oral contraceptives. An alternate contraceptive method might be suggested to women taking barbiturates. #References .........................

Selegiline is a derivative of phenethylamine. It has also been used for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia and narcolepsy. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofselegiline in pregnant women. The literature consists of case reports involving 30-40 women in total with Parkinson's disease.Side effects include ventricular arrhythmia, N/V, diarrhea, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, vivid dreams, headache,anxiety, anemia, hair loss, fatigue, and low back pain. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether selegiline crosses the human placenta. Monoamine neurotransmitters are important for the development of the immature brain. Their endogenous levels are highly regulated by MAO, and any change in enzymeactivity could have a profound effect on brain development. Some recommend discontinuing MAOIs before conception. Unfortunately, there is little scientific information on which tobase such decisions. Rodent studies are generally reassuring,revealing no evidence of teratogenicity at doses higher than those used clinically. There was evidence of embryotoxicity at high doses. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. It is unknown whether selegiline enters human breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Carbamazepine slightly increases levels of selegiline and its metabolites. Changes in plasma concentrations are nearly 2-fold but variable across the subject population. Carbamazepine is contraindicated with MAOIs, including selegiline. Use with phenylpropanolamine was associated with a higher incidence of significant BP elevations than withphenylpropanolamine alone, suggesting a possible pharmacodynamic interaction. There were no clinically significant changes in BP with pseudoephedrine use, but hypertension has been reported with ephedrine. It is prudent to avoid the concomitant use of sympathomimetic agents with selegiline. 1025Has greater affinity for MAO-B; this selectivity is lost as its concentration increases. In addition to their role in the catabolism of CNS monoamines, MAOs are also important in the catabolism of exogenous amines found in foods and drugs. MAO in the GI tract(primarily type A) protects from exogenous amines with vasopressor actions, such as tyramine, which if absorbed intact can cause a hypertensive crisis (the so-called cheese reaction). If a large amountof tyramine is absorbed, it is taken up by adrenergic neurons andcauses hypertension secondary to NE release from neuronal storage sites. While most foods contain negligible amounts or no tyramine, a few food products may contain large amounts that represent apotential risk for patients with significant inhibition of GI MAO-A.Studies suggest selegiline 6mg/24h does not require a modified diet. Due to the more limited data available for 9mg/24h and 12mg/24h,patients taking these doses should follow a modified diet . Stupor, muscular rigidity, severe agitation, and elevatedtemperature have been reported when used with meperidine. Symptoms usually resolve over days when the combination isdiscontinued. This is typical of the interaction of meperidineand MAOIs. Other serious reactions (including severe agitation, hallucinations, and death) have been reported in patients receiving this combination. Severe toxicity has also been reportedwhen used with TCAs and SSRIs.Use with dextromethorphan has been reported to cause brief episodes of psychosis or bizarre behavior. Therefore,dextromethorphan should not be used be used during pregnancy and lactation only if the benefit justifies the potential Selsun 2.5 (Hong Kong); Selsun Blue (Finland, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland); Selsun R (Netherlands); Selukos (Austria, Finland, hands, avoid contact with jewelry. /C15Contraindications \u2014hypersensitivity to drug or class, inflamed skin /C15Caution \u2014unknown 1026#Maternal Considerations .....

Despite a long clinical experience, there are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of senna in pregnant women. Senna is absorbed across the GI tract only to a limited degree. Some believe senna is the purgative of choice during pregnancy and lactation. It effectively relieves postpartumconstipation. It does not affect the myometrial activity of the pregnant ewe. Side effects include laxative abuse, nausea, bloating, cramps, flatulence, diarrhea, melanosis coli, and discolored urine. #Fetal Considerations ...........

Depression is common during and after pregnancy, but typically goes unrecognized. Pregnancy is not a reason a priori to discontinue psychotropic drugs. There are no adequate reports orwell-controlled studies of sertraline in pregnant women, though there is growing experience with its use for the treatment ofpostpartum depression. However, sertraline is not recommended for prophylactic use. In general, women taking SSRIs duringpregnancy for depression require an increased dose to maintaineuthymia. Yet in the one longitudinal study clearance wasunaltered during pregnancy. 1028Side effects include serotonin withdrawal syndrome, withdrawal syndrome, N/V, diarrhea, insomnia, headache, dry mouth, somnolence, dizziness, fatigue, tremor, dyspepsia, constipation, decreased libido, sweating, anorexia, nervousness, agitation,anxiety, and visual disturbances. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. Sertraline crosses the human placenta and enters the AF. Limited study suggests a low F:M ratio approximating 0.30-0.67, lower than citalopram, fluoxetine, andparoxetine. Maternal doses predict the umbilical cord concentration. Though there remains controversy, the most recent epidemiologic analyses reveal asignificant association with omphalocele (OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.6-20.7; 3 subjects) and septal defects (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-4.0; 13 exposed subjects). An increased prevalence of IUGRcannot be excluded. Neonatal abstinence syndrome may occur inup to 1=3of exposed neonates. There is some concern that the impact of antenatal exposure continues for at least a few months.Newborns chronically exposed to SSRIs have reduced responses topain. Rodent studies are generally reassuring, though a delay in ossification was noted in rabbits. Further, the fetal loss rate is increased by late pregnancy exposure. The mechanism andsignificance are unclear. The exposure of mouse embryos in culturetosertraline at a high concentration (10 mM) causes craniofacial malformations without evidence of general embryotoxicity,consistent with a direct action at 5-HT uptake sites. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Sertraline and desmethylsertraline are present in human breast milk. The concentrations are affected by the fraction of milksampled, the time after maternal dose (max 7-10h), and dailydose. The mean maximum calculated nursing infant doses of sertraline (0.67mg/d) and desmethylsertraline (1.44mg/d) represent 0.54% of the maternal daily dose. Neonatal serum concentration is usually below the detection limit of mostcommercial laboratories. If breastfed, the infant should be monitored for possible adverse effects, the drug given at the lowest effective dose, and breastfeeding avoided at times ofpeak drug levels. #Drug Interactions ................ Tightly bound to plasma protein; its use with other drugs tightlybound to protein (e.g., digitoxin, warfarin ) may cause a shift in plasma levels. Conversely, adverse effects may result from displacement of protein-bound sertraline by other tightly bound drugs. Cimetidine significantly increased the sertraline mean AUC (50%), C max(24%), and t/2 (26%) compared to placebo. The clinical significance is unknown.Sertraline decreases diazepam clearance by 1=3; the clinical significance is unknown.Increases the pimozide AUC and C maxby about 40%, but is not associated with any changes in ECG. Since the highestrecommended pimozide dose (10mg) has not been evaluated in combination with sertraline, the effect on QT interval and pharmacokinetic parameters at doses higher than 2mg are not known. While the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, concomitant administration of sertraline andpimozide is contraindicated due to the narrow therapeutic index of pimozide. The duration of an appropriate washout period that shouldintervene before switching from one SSRI to another has notbeen established.Many drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder (e.g., the SSRIs, including sertraline, and most TCAs) 1029inhibit the biochemical activity of CYP2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase), and, thus, may increase the plasma concentrations of co-administered drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. The drugs for which this potential interaction is of greatest concernare those metabolized primarily by 2D6 and that have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., the TCAs and the class 1C antiarrhythmics flecainide andpropafenone ). There is variability among the drugs effective in the treatment of major depressivedisorder in the extent of clinically important 2D6 inhibition, and in fact sertraline at lower doses has a less prominent inhibitory effect on 2D6 than some others in the class. Nevertheless, even sertraline has the potential for clinically important 2D6 inhibition, and use with a drug metabolized by CYP2D6 may require lower doses than usual. Furthermore, an increased dose of the co-administered drug may be required whenever sertraline is withdrawn.There are rare post-marketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of an SSRI and sumatriptan. If concomitant treatment with fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, is patient observation is advised.The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinicalproblems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated as sertraline may inhibit TCA metabolism. Plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored andthe dose of TCA reduced. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Studies reveal an association between the use ofpsychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper GI bleeding when used with nonselective NSAIDs. Patients should be cautioned about the use of with sertraline. #References MF, Psychopharmacol2008; 28:646-53. Hendrick V, Smith V, Stowe Anxiety 2000;11:51-7.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of sevoflurane in pregnant women. It is popular for cesarean delivery when general anesthesia is elected, producing an intraoperative course and neonatal outcome similar to that of either isoflurane or a subarachnoid block. Like the other volatile anesthetics ( halothane andisoflurane ),sevoflurane reduces oxytocin-induced contraction of pregnant rat myometrium mediated, at least in part, by activation of Ca2+-activated K+channels. In vitro , it is a vasodilator of chorionic plate vessels. A limited number of case reports in the 1st trimester do notreport adverse outcomes.Side effects include malignant hyperthermia, arrhythmias, hepatitis, increased N/V, agitation, cough, hypotension,shivering, laryngospasm, holding, increased tachycardia, hypertension, and apnea. #Fetal Considerations ........... Sevoflurane rapidly crosses the human placenta. It has been used for fetal anesthesia during the EXIT procedure. Rodent studiesare reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR. Neonatal adaptive capacity may be reduced during the first 24h compared to desflurane . #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. It is unknown whether sevoflurane enters human breast milk. However, considering the indication and 1031dosing, one-time sevoflurane use is unlikely to pose a clinically significant risk to the breastfeeding neonate. #Drug Interactions ................ Benzodiazepines and opioids would be expected to decrease the MAC of sevoflurane in the same manner as with other inhalational anesthetics. Sevoflurane administration is compatible with benzodiazepines and opioids as commonly used in surgical practice.The anesthetic requirement for sevoflurane is decreased when administered in combination with nitrous oxide. Using 50% N 2O, the MAC equivalent dose requirement is reduced approximately50% in adults.Increases both the intensity and duration of neuromuscularblockade induced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. When of neuromuscular blocking agents requiresequilibration of muscle with delivered partial pressure of sevoflurane. Reduced doses of neuromuscular blocking agents during induction of anesthesia may result in delayed onset of conditions suitable for endotracheal intubation or inadequate muscle relaxation. #References .........................

Obesity is a major epidemic in the industrialized countries. Observational studies confirm a relationship between obesity and CV disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, certain forms of cancer, gallstones, certain respiratory disorders, and an increase in overallmortality rate. These studies suggest that weight loss, if maintained, may produce health benefits for patients with chronic obesity. Sibutramine leads to dose-dependent weight loss. Maintenance therapy enhances the likelihood of maintaining the loss. Thepublished experience during pregnancy is limited to case reports and small series. Clearance is modestly decreased in women. Side effects include menstrual irregularities, dysmenorrhea, tachycardia, severe hypertension, seizures, headache, dry mouth,insomnia, rhinitis, anorexia, constipation, increased appetite, dizziness, anxiety, dyspepsia, nausea, rash, and sinusitis. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether sibutramine crosses the human placenta. Case reports and small series are reassuring. Rodentstudies are generally reassuring, with dysmorphology noted only atthe highest doses concurrent with maternal toxicity and only in rabbits. Transport across the rodent placenta is limited. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women.

Simvastatin is a synthetic statin that reduces the overall lipid level and the associated risk of adverse CV events. It may modestly increase the risk of cholelithiasis. Simvastatin does not affect gonadotropin function in premenopausal women. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of simvastatin in pregnant women. Post-marketing studies do not suggest an increase in adverse outcomes. However, atherosclerosis is a chronic process. Discontinuation during pregnancy shouldhave little impact on the long-term therapeutic outcome of primary hypercholesterolemia. Side effects include rhabdomyolysis, and rash. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether simvastatin crosses the human placenta. Post-marketing studies are reassuring, as are rodent studies, which reveal no evidence of teratogenicity despite doses that were multiples of the MRHD. Inadvertent exposurewould not be a medical indication for pregnancy termination. However, cholesterol and other products of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway are essential components for fetaldevelopment. In vitro, simvastatin sharply inhibited migration of extravillous trophoblast from villi into matrigel. Further, it inhibited half of the proliferative events in the villi and increased apoptosis of cytotrophoblast cells compared to control. Finally,simvastatin significantly decreased secretion of progesterone from the placental explants. Thus, exposed pregnancies may be at increased risk for IUGR. It is generally considered the potential fetal risk of simvastatin use outweighs the benefit to the mother. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofsotalol in pregnant women. The published literature is limited to case reports. Sotalol reduces BP in hypertensive women, but its reported use during pregnancy is restricted to its properties as anantiarrhythmic agent. Side effects include torsades de pointes, ventricular prolonged QT interval, bradycardia chest pain, palpitations, asthenia, hypotension,headache, N/V, diarrhea, edema, sweating, and dyspepsia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Sotalol crosses the human placenta, reaching an F:M ratio approximating unity, and is found in AF. It has been used to treat fetal tachyarrhythmia where the mean F:M sotalol plasma concentration is 1.1 (range, 0.67-2.87; SD, 0.63), and the mean AF:fetal blood ratio is 3.2 (range, 1.28-5.8; SD, 1.4). The response rate exceeded 75% in the largest report. The effectiveness of sotalol, however, cannot be extrapolated from maternal blood levels. Rodent studies are reassuring,revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. In rabbits, high doses are associated with embryonic death most likely secondary toembryonic arrhythmia. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Sotalol enters human breast milk. Mean M:P ratios of 2.4-5.4 are reported, with milk levels ranging from 5 to 20.2mg/L. There was no consistent difference in sotalol concentration between pre- and postfeed milk samples. Using an 1044average milk intake of 0.15L/kg/d, it was calculated that an infant would have received a dose some 20-23% of the maternal dose. This dose was not associated with any bradycardia. However, because of the relatively large infant exposure to the drug,breastfeeding should be undertaken only when the infant is closely monitored and side effects such as bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory distress, or hypoglycemia arenot demonstrable. ) and other class III drugs (e.g., amiodarone ) are not recommended because of their potential to prolong refractoriness.Use with caution in conjunction with calcium channel blocking drugs because of possible additive effects on AV conduction or ventricular function. Use of these drugs may have additive effectson BP, leading to hypotension.Use with catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., guanethidine, reserpine ) may produce an excessive reduction of resting sympathetic nervous tone. Patients should be monitored closelyfor hypotension and or marked bradycardia. b-Agonists (e.g., ) may require increased May potentiate the rebound hypertension sometimes observedafter discontinuing clonidine. Avoid use within 2h of antacids containing aluminum oxide andmagnesium hydroxide as they may reduce the C maxand AUC by 26% and 20%, respectively. Use of an antacid 2h after sotalol has no effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics.

Spectinomycin is not effective for the treatment of syphilis, and may in fact mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis. All patients with gonorrhea should be serologically tested for syphilis at diagnosis, and again 3mo later. There are no adequatereports or well-controlled studies of spectinomycin in pregnant women. Failure to achieve ''microbiologic cure'' is similar for common antibiotic regimens: amoxicillin compared with cefixime (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.16-9.04). Thus, the selection is based on sensitivities in the geographic locale, price, and the prevalence ofsyphilis. Sex partners should be tested and treated when possible. Side effects include urticaria, dizziness, nausea, chills, fever, injection site pain, insomnia, anemia, and elevated BUN and LFTs. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether spectinomycin crosses the human placenta. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether spectinomycin enters human breast milk. Considering the likely dosage and that other aminoglycosides are generally considered safe for breastfeeding, the same should betrue for spectinomycin. #Drug Interactions ................ clinically (likely) /C15Spectinomycin is one of several available effective agents for the treatment of gonorrhea during pregnancy and qd PO qd /C24-28d (until ..... Spironolactone increases sodium and water excretion while retaining potassium. There are no adequate reports or well- controlled studies of spironolactone in pregnant women. Diuretics should not be used to treat the physiologic edema of pregnancy and do not prevent preeclampsia. There are superior agents for such off-label indications as hirsutism. It has been usedfor the treatment of maternal Bartter's syndrome during pregnancy with success. Side effects include renal failure, hepatotoxicity, menstrual irregularities, agranulocytosis, anaphylaxis, N/V, diarrhea,abdominal metabolic acidosis. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether spironolactone crosses the human placenta. Spironolactone is an antiandrogen and can feminize male rats. However, there is at least one case reportof an appropriately developed male newborn after high-dose treatment for maternal Bartter's syndrome. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... While spironolactone and its major active metabolite enter human breast milk, it is estimated that the breastfeeding neonatewould ingest <0.5% of the daily maternal dose. #Drug Interactions ................ Use with ACEIs has been associated with severe hyperkalemia. Use with alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics may potentiate orthostatic hypotension. Use particularly hypokalemia. 1047Reduces the vascular responsiveness to NE. Exercise caution with patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia. Possible increased responsiveness to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants may result.Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and increase the risk of lithium toxicity. In some patients, use with an NSAID can reduce the diuretic,natriuretic, and antihypertensive effect of loop, potassium-sparing, and thiazide diuretics and has been associated with severe hyperkalemia.

St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) International HIV /C15Caution\u2014 cataract #Maternal Considerations ..... St. John's wort is an herb used medicinally for centuries. The composition of St. John's wort and how it might work are not well understood. It contains multiple bioactive substances. The naphthodianthrones hypericin and pseudohypericin and multiple flavonoids have generated interest as potential 1049antidepressant and antiviral agents. In vitro studies reveal MAO inhibitory activity. Studies suggest that St. John's wort is of no benefit in treating major depression of moderate severity. A National Institutes of Health study revealed that concomitantadministration of St. John's wort andindinavir substantially decreased indinavir plasma concentrations, potentially due to induction of CYP3A4 by St. John's wort. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of St. John's wort during pregnancy. Relevant questions remain regarding the use of St. John's wort in HIV-positive pregnant women treated concomitantly with protease inhibitors and NNTRIs. St. John's wort is best avoided during pregnancy. Side effects include early-onset cataract, dry mouth, dizziness, sexual dysfunction, GI symptoms, increased sensitivity to sunlight, fatigue, and reduction of the effectiveness of several drugs. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether St. John's wort crosses the human placenta. One rodent study suggests maternal administration before and throughout gestation does not affect long-term growth and physical maturation of the exposed offspring. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of St. John's wort in breastfeeding women. One observational study suggests an increased prevalence of neonatal drowsiness/lethargycompared to control. Another study noted that hyperforin wasexcreted into breast milk at low levels, but was at or below thelevel of detection in the neonates (n = 2). M:P ratios ranged from 0.04 to 0.13. The relative infant dose of 0.9-2.5% indicates that infant exposure to hyperforin through milk is comparable tolevels reported in most studies assessing antidepressants or neuroleptics. No side effects were seen in the mothers or infants. #Drug Interactions ................ St. John's wort is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 and, as such, may decrease the concentrations of drugs metabolized by this enzyme(e.g., indinavir ). #References .........................

Streptokinase is a purified bacterial protein produced by group C b-hemolytic streptococci. There is no residual thrombotic material in 60-75% of patients treated with streptokinase vs. only 10% of those treated with heparin. Therapy preserves venous valve function in most cases, avoiding the pathologic changes thatcause postphlebitic syndrome, which follows in 90% of the DVT patients treated with heparin alone. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of streptokinase in pregnant women, though numerous case reports suggest relative safety compared to therapeutic alternatives. Of special note is its success with thrombotic mechanical mitral valves. Hemorrhage complicates <10% but may be severe. Because of the increased likelihood of resistance due to anti-streptokinase antibody, streptokinase may be ineffective within 1y of prior administration, or a streptococcal infection, such as streptococcal pharyngitis, acute rheumatic fever, or acute glomerulonephritissecondary to a streptococcal infection. Side effects include anaphylaxis, cholesterol embolism, arrhythmia, severe bleeding, stroke, hypotension, fever, and bronchospasm. #Fetal Considerations ...........

It is the drug routinely used in rapid-sequence induction of general anesthesia to facilitate tracheal intubation for cesarean delivery. The large clinical experience is reassuring. Plasma cholinesterase levelsdecrease by 1=4during pregnancy and for several days postpartum. Thus, a higher proportion of patients may experience prolonged apnea in response to succinylcholine when pregnant compared to nonpregnant. Side effects include arrhythmias, bradycardia, tachycardia, salivation,and increased intraocular pressure. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Small amounts of succinylcholine are known to cross the placenta, but under normal conditions the amount of drug does not endanger the fetus. But because the amount that crosses depends on the M:F concentration gradient, apnea and 1052flaccidity can occur in the neonate after repeated high doses, or in the presence of atypical maternal plasma cholinesterase. Rodent teratogenicity studies have not been conducted. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women.

Sufentanil is a potent opioid. When used in balanced general anesthesia, sufentanil has perhaps 10 /C2the potency of fentanyl. 1054It is popular combined with a local anesthetic for a variety of neuraxial anesthetic techniques during labor. However, when choosing between fentanyl andsufentanil, sufentanil costs more and has a greater risk of dosing error because of its higher potency. The duration of analgesia is reduced in cocaine -abusing women.Side effects include blurred vision. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Sufentanil crosses the human placenta, achieving an F:M ratio of unity. Because of its low initial umbilical veinconcentration, sufentanil may be the opioid of choice when delivery is imminent ( <45min). Fetal acidosis increases placental transfer. It is used for fetal analgesia during a variety of procedures. Rodent studies are generally reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doseshigher than those used clinically. Embryotoxicity does occur at doses twice the MRHD. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. However, considering the indication and dosing, one-time sufentanil use is unlikely to pose a clinically significant risk to the breastfeeding neonate. #Drug Interactions ................

Toxoplasmosis is one of the most common parasitic infections in humans. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of sulfadiazine in pregnant women for maternal disease. Sulfadiazine is also marketed as a silver-based cream used as an adjunct for the prevention and treatment of wound sepsis in patients with 2nd and 3rd degree burns. Side effects include hemolytic anemia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hepatitis, acute renalfailure, kernicterus in the newborn, fever, dizziness, headache, N/V, diarrhea, photosensitivity, rash, and hematuria. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Sulfadiazine crosses the human placenta and is used as a treatment for fetal toxoplasmosis in combination withpyrimethamine. Controversy continues as to how effective it is in preventing disease transmission. Since it is effective in the rhesus monkey model, treatment delay may explain the controversy. Rodent teratogenicity studies have not been performed. Othersulfonamides given at multiples of the MRHD are associated withcleft palate and bony abnormalities. It is also standard postnatally for the treatment of congenital toxoplasmosis. The extensive human experience associated with congenital toxoplasmosis isreassuring. There is no published experience to suggest anyincrease in the risk of kernicterus. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. While it isunknown whether sulfadiazine enters human breast milk, it is excreted into cows' milk. There are no adverse effects publishedin breastfed children. #Drug Interactions ................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies ofsulfamethoxazole in pregnant women. When combined with trimethoprim, it is effective for the treatment of Q fever and for the treatment/prophylaxis of PCP. Trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole is an alternative to high-dose penicillin for the treatment of listeriosis. It is also used to treat cystitis, but thereare growing rates of bacterial resistance. 1058Side effects include agranulocytosis, anemia, hypoglycemia, hepatocellular necrosis, and various allergic reactions. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Sulfamethoxazole readily crosses the human placenta. One study noted a small increase in the rate of CVmalformations after treatment with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. The causative agent was unclear. There is no published evidence to suggest it isassociated with bilirubin toxicity, as is sulfisoxazole. Rodent studies performed at high multiples of the MRHD revealed an increased prevalence of cleft palate. It is probably best to avoid during the 1st trimester as it is an inhibitor of folate synthesis. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

Sulindac is an NSAID, also possessing analgesic and antipyretic activities. It also inhibits certain transcription factors such as NF- kB and AP-1, as does ibuprofen but not indomethacin. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of sulindac in pregnant women. Very limited study suggests it is equallyeffective as indomethacin for the prolongation of pregnancy in women with preterm labor. The use of sulindac until 34w after successful tocolysis fails to reduce the incidence of readmission for preterm labor or prolong the gestational age at delivery. It has also been used prophylactically in monochorionic twinpregnancies to reduce the volume of AF and stabilize the fetal lie.Side effects include GI bleeding, tinnitus. ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Sulindac crosses the human placenta, producing F:M ratios approximating 0.4. Fetal levels are dependent onthe maternal, as NSAID agents are not metabolized by the fetalkidney. Like other NSAIDs, sulindac causes dose-dependent and reversible ductal constriction and oligohydramnios. Rodent studies reveal an increased incidence of cleft palate (not seen with indomethacin ), and there is an increased risk of IUGR and fetal death. 1062#Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. It is unknown whether sulindac enters human breast milk; it does enter rat milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Dimethyl sulfoxide may reduce the plasma levels of the active sulfide metabolite of sulindac and potentially its efficacy. This combination has also been reported to cause peripheral neuropathy.Aspirin significantly depressed the plasma levels of the active sulfide metabolite of sulindac. Since the combination did not have a favorable effect on the therapeutic response, it is notrecommended.Use with other NSAIDs is not recommended due to the increased possibility of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy. NSAIDs decrease the tubular secretion of methotrexate and thus may potentiate its toxicity.NSAIDs may increase cyclosporine toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin. #References NSAIDs share certain characteristic effects on pregnant women and their fetuses, they are not interchangeable. /C15Sulindac should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if the benefit justifies the potential perinatal \u2014(Imigran; Imitrex) International Brand Name\u2014 Cetatrex (Indonesia); Imigran (Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, England, Finland, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Uruguay, /C21, may (20mg/spray) oral, parenteral, and May be combined with naproxen . /C15Contraindications \u2014hypersensitivity to <24h, cardiac risk factors #Maternal .....

A growing number of obstetric patients have benefited from organ transplantation. Pregnancy is considered reasonable if thepatient is 2y post transplantation, has good renal functionwithout proteinuria, no uncontrolled arterial hypertension, and no evidence of ongoing rejection. However, these women are at high risk for an adverse outcome and should be followed at atertiary care hospital. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of tacrolimus in pregnant women. Though it has been used widely during pregnancy without obvious adverseeffect, the published experience is limited to case series. Clearanceis not significantly altered. Side effects include thrombocytopenia, nephrotoxicity, hypertension, hyperkalemia, seizures, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, malignancy, nausea, diarrhea, headache,insomnia, abdominal pain, tremor, weakness, fever, hyperglycemia, anemia, itching, elevated LFTs, anorexia, and renal dysfunction. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses, and little animal experience. It is unknown whether tacrolimus crosses the placenta. Human studies do not reveal obvious evidence of teratogenicity. Immunosuppressionis a theoretic concern. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Tacrolimus does enter human breast milk but at a very low concentration ( <2ng/ml) with an M:P ratio <0.55. Using this information, the estimated dose ingested by a neonatewould be <1mg/kg/d. Considering the low bioavailability of tacrolimus (<32%), the amount absorbed would be even lower (0.02-0.5% of the mother's weight-adjusted dose). #Drug Interactions ................ Care should be taken with drugs associated with renaldysfunction due to the potential for additive or synergistic impairment. These drugs include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, cisplatin, and possibly cyclosporine. Patients switched from cyclosporine totacrolimus should receive the first tacrolimus dose no sooner than 24h after the last cyclosporine dose. Metabolized mainly by CYP3A, and substances that inhibit theseisozymes may decrease the metabolism or increase the bioavailability of tacrolimus. In contrast, drugs known to induce 1066CYP3A may result in an increased metabolism of tacrolimus or decreased bioavailability, resulting in decreased plasma levels. Monitoring with appropriate dose adjustments is essential. Drugs that may increase tacrolimus blood levels include calcium channel blockers Frequent monitoring of tacrolimus blood levels and appropriate dose adjustments are essential.May affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs (e.g., phenytoin ) and increase their concentration.Grapefruit juice affects CYP3A-mediated metabolism and shouldbe avoided.The use of live vaccines should be avoided; live vaccines include, but are not limited to, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, and TY 21a typhoid.Interaction studies with tacrolimus ointment have not been conducted. Based on its minimal absorption, interactions of tacrolimus ointment with systemically administered drugs are unlikely. Use of known CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients with widespread and/or erythrodermic disease should be undertaken with caution. Examples of such drugs are calcium JR. Transplantation al.

The effect of SERMs on the estrogen receptor is tissue-dependent. It is anantagonist in the breast. The potential role of tamoxifen in the prevention of breast cancer is unclear and the subject of several large ongoing trials. It appears to reduce the incidence of ER+ invasive and noninvasive cancer. Until the completion of these trials, prophylaxis should probably be confined to women at high risk. Tamoxifen is an agonist in the uterus, increasing the risk of endometrial cancer and sarcoma. It is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Tamoxifen does not cause infertility. Rather, it appears equal to clomiphene for ovulation induction in anovulatory women. There are noadequate reports or well-controlled studies of tamoxifen in pregnant women. Breast cancers diagnosed during pregnancy andlactation typically are aggressive and present at an advanced stage. All women should be counseled on fertility preservation options. The timing of treatment modalities in pregnant women iscomplex and requires multidisciplinary input. Alternatives that are relatively safe for both mother and fetus are available, though unforeseen risks may exist. The published literature includesnumerous cases of breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy,with surgery followed by tamoxifen therapy usually after the 1st trimester. There were no obvious drug-related complications.The addition of tamoxifen to a regimen of misoprostol for medical abortion is unnecessary.Side effects include thromboembolism, CVA, endometrial cancer, endometrial hyperplasia, hot flashes, vaginal pain, hypercalcemia,thrombocytopenia, vulvar pruritus, hair loss, anorexia, and elevated LFTs. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether tamoxifen crosses the human placenta. Tamoxifen has effects on genital tract development similar to estrogen. There are several reportssuggesting an association between 1st trimester exposure andcraniofacial abnormalities. In rodents, tamoxifen inhibits uteroplacental artery dilation, decreases placental and fetalweights, and as a consequence increases the risk of fetal death. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. It is unknown whether tamoxifen enters human breast milk. It is generally recommended women not breastfeed while taking tamoxifen. #Drug Interactions ................ May augment the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. Careful monitoring of INR is recommended.There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events occurring when cytotoxic agents are used in combination. Reduces letrozole plasma levels by 1=3.

Technetium-99m is excreted in human milk during lactation for about 24h after administration. While formula feedings for at least 24h after testing may seem prudent, a single case report suggests this may not be necessary. In thisinstance, sample radioactivity concentration peaked at 15h anddecayed monoexponentially (half-clearance time was 4.8h).

The plasma concentration of telmisartan is 2-3/C2higher in females than in males. There is no published experience with telmisartan during pregnancy. Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system should be avoided during pregnancy for fetal indications. The lowest effective dose should be used when telmisartan is required during pregnancy for BP control. Side effects include angioedema, hypotension, dizziness, URI symptoms, back pain, diarrhea, fatigue, dyspepsia, neutropenia, leukopenia, and hyperkalemia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether telmisartan crosses the human placenta. Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system are considered contraindicated throughout pregnancy as their use has been associated with cranial hypoplasia, anuria, reversible orirreversible renal failure, PDA. If oligohydramnios is observed, telmisartan should be discontinued unless considered lifesaving for themother. Antenatal surveillance (e.g., BPP) may be appropriate,depending upon gestational age. Oligohydramnios may not appear until after irreversible injury. There is a single report of neonatal renal failure after antenatal exposure. Neonates exposedshould be closely observed for hypotension, oliguria, andhyperkalemia.

Considerations ..... Residual medication effects (''hangover'') are essentially absent with temazepam, and early morning awakening, a particular problem for the geriatric patient, is significantly reducedcompared to similar agents. REM sleep is unchanged. There areno adequate reports or well-controlled studies of temazepam in pregnant women. One case report suggested an association with a fetal demise. Side effects include respiratory depression, seizures, coma, drowsiness, headache, fatigue, nervousness, lethargy, dizziness,N/V, anxiety, depression, dry mouth, diarrhea, abdominal pain, euphoria, weakness, blurred vision, nightmares, and vertigo. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Temazepam crosses the 2nd trimester human placenta, achieving an F:M ratio approximating 0.38 1h after 10mg IV. The ratio was stable between 60 and 120min, but rosewith advancing gestation age. Third trimester studies are unavailable. Several studies suggest an increased prevalence of fetal malformation after diazepam use during the 1st trimester. Decreased fetal movement frequently follows IV diazepam administration, and prolonged CNS depression may occur in neonates due to their inability to metabolize. It is unknown whether the effect of temazepam is similar. The shortest course and the lowest dose should be used if indicated duringpregnancy. Rodent teratogenicity studies reveal an increased prevalence of skeletal abnormalities and embryo loss. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Tenazepam is excreted into breast milk. In the one report, at concentrations of 26-28mcg/L for the pre- and postfeed samples, the M:P ratio for temazepam ranged from <0.09 to <0.63 (mean <0.18). Benzodiazepines in general enter human breast milk and may cause lethargy, sedation, and weight loss in infants. Some newborns exposed antenatally to diazepam exhibit either the floppy infant syndrome, or marked neonatal withdrawal symptoms. 1074#Drug Interactions ................

Terbutaline is a popular and effective agent for the treatment of asthma during pregnancy. While generally considered a selectiveb 2-agonist based on in vitro study, its clinical profile is less specific. As with all other b-mimetics and most tocolytic agents, terbutaline is associated with an /C2448h delay in delivery compared to placebo in women with preterm labor. Pregnancyoutcome is altered only when coupled with antenatal steroid administration. As it is for all other currently available drugs, theuse of either oral or continuous SC treatment is ineffective preterm labor prophylaxis. Maternal side effects are common and often lead to discontinuation of therapy. Serious adversereactions, including pulmonary edema and maternal death, havebeen reported with terbutaline. In rodents, LPS enhances the tocolytic effect of terbutaline . Recently, it was concluded that 1080nifedipine andindomethacin are more cost-effective tocolytic agents than either terbutaline ormagnesium sulfate because of the cost of monitoring and treating adverse events. Not surprisingly, several large meta-analyses conclude that, of thecurrently available agents, nifedipine is the tocolytic of choice. Terbutaline has also been used in the setting of fetal bradycardia while plans for delivery were underway. In one recent RCT,110 women had nonreassuring FHR tracings in 64.2%; p = 0.38). Terbutaline resulted in lower contraction rates and a decreased prevalence of uterinetachysystole. Maternal MAP decreased with nitroglycerin but not terbutaline. Terbutaline also seems useful for the correction of oxytocin-induced tachysystole, but is probably medicallyindicated only when associated with an FHR abnormality.Side effects include pulmonary edema, hypotension, tachycardia, palpitations, arrhythmia, tremor, headache, cramps, and hyperglycemia. #Fetal Considerations ........... Terbutaline crosses the human placenta, achieving an F:M ratio between 0.11 and 0.48 after a single IV dose immediately prior toelective cesarean delivery. Levels approach unity after severalhours. Multiple case reports suggest it is chronotropic in fetuses with complete heart block. The effect, if any, is often transient perhaps because b-adrenergic innervation is still relatively immature even at birth. Allegations that terbutaline exposure during pregnancy causes autism cannot be sustained on any level because of the high doses studied coupled to a lack of evidence thatterbutaline crosses the fetal blood-brain barrier. Paradoxically, there is no receptor desensitization demonstrable in the fetal rat heart exposed chronically to terbutaline. Rodent studies are reassuring, showing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically.Terbutaline increases the frequency of fetal breathing. Chronic terbutaline exposure increases cardiac size and HR in fetal guinea pigs. Overall, it appears long-term terbutaline use has measurable fetal affects at least in rodents. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Terbutaline is excreted into human breast milk, reaching M:P ratios in excess of 2. Yet, the amount ingested is <1% of the maternal dose, and the neonatal level undetectable. #Drug Interactions ................ Other sympathomimetic agents should not be used withterbutaline since their combined effect on the CV system may be deleterious. Use with caution in patients being treated with MAOIs or TCAs since the action of terbutaline on the vascular system may be potentiated.b-Adrenergic blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect ofterbutaline but may trigger a severe attack in asthmatic patients. #References .........................

Tetanus immune globulin creates passive immunity to the toxin ofC. tetani. Naturally acquired immunity to tetanus toxin is rare in the US. Universal primary vaccination, with subsequent timed boosters to maintain adequate antitoxin levels, is required for all age groups. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of tetanus immune globulin in pregnant women. Tetanus is a highly lethal disease and a significant cause of maternal death in some locales. It appears the antibodies produced in response totetanus toxoid during pregnancy have low protective capacity, strengthening the importance of tetanus immune globulin prophylaxis during pregnancy. The long clinical experience suggests safety. 1083Side effects include injection site soreness, fever, angioneurotic edema, and nephrotic syndrome. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Tetanus immune globulin crosses the human placenta and provides at least partial coverage for the neonate.Maternal immunization does not interfere with neonatal responseto the DPT series. The degree of IgG transfer is lower in thepreterm compared to the term neonate, and there appears to be a maximal transfer rate. Rodent teratogenicity studies have not been performed, but there is no reason to hypothesize theantibody may damage the fetus. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

Serologic tests demonstrate naturally acquired immunity totetanus toxin is rare in the US. Universal primary vaccination, with subsequent timed boosters to maintain adequate antitoxinlevels, is required for all age groups. Tetanus is a highly lethal disease and a significant cause of maternal death in some locales. Tetanus toxoid is a highly effective antigen; a completed primary series generally induces protection that persists /C2110 years. Increasing the interval between primary immunizing doses to 6mo or longer does not interfere with the final immunity. Any dose of tetanus toxoid received, even a decade earlier, is counted as the first immunizing injection. There are no adequate reportsor well-controlled studies of tetanus toxoid in pregnant women. Pregnant women do respond. In many geographic locales, acogent argument can be made for routine immunization withat least 1 dose during pregnancy to protect both mother and newborn. Side effects include injection site soreness, fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, generalized aches, hypotension, and pruritus. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. The antibodies generated in response to tetanus toxoid appear to cross the human placenta, and are capable of stimulating active immunity in the term fetus.

There areno adequate reports or well-controlled studies of tetracaine in pregnant women. Although once routinely used (mixed with either 10% glucose or 10% procaine ) for spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery, tetracaine has been supplanted by bupivacaine as the spinal agent of choice for cesarean delivery.

Side effects include pseudotumor cerebri, hepatotoxicity, Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, pseudomembranous colitis, 1087pericarditis, and increased BUN. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Tetracycline crosses the human placenta and may cause a yellow-gray-brown tooth discoloration in adults after fetal/childhood exposure. It is unlikely topically applied tetracycline achieves a clinically relevant systemic level. Another tetracycline , oxytetracycline (but not doxycycline ) is associated with an increased risk of NTDs, cleft palate, and CV defects. There are no similar studies for tetracycline. Rodent studies are otherwise generally reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity, but some embryotoxicity at high doses. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursingwomen. Tetracycline enters human breast milk, though the kinetics remain to be elucidated. Clinical experience suggests that maternal oral ingestion is compatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ Avoid using with a bactericidal antibiotic since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action. Patients' anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of the dose.Use with methoxyflurane may cause fatal renal toxicity. Absorption is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium and preparations containing iron, zinc, orsodium bicarbonate.

It is also excreted in semen, and treated males should wear a condom during coitus. Initially banned in the US, it has proven a superb drug for the treatment of several formerlyresistant diseases. Its potential indications are growing, increasing the likelihood of an inadvertent pregnancy. Effective contraception is mandatory. While there are no reports ofthalidomide -related birth defects in the US since its return to the market, there are scattered reports elsewhere, providing a constant reminder to providers. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of thalidomide in pregnant women. Side effects include severe birth defects, peripheral neuropathy, toxic epidermal necrolysis, seizures, bradycardia, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, syndrome, drowsiness, dizziness, rash, diarrhea, fever, chills, increasedappetite, weight gain, confusion, amnesia, mood changes, photosensitivity, neutropenia, and increased HIV viral load. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Thalidomide crosses the human placenta and is a potent human (but not rodent) teratogen, causing limb abnormalitiesafter 1st trimester exposure, perhaps by creating a pro-oxidantbalance. Even a single 50mg dose can cause defects. If pregnancyoccurs, the drug should be discontinued and the patient referred to a fetal medicine expert for evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure to thalidomide must be reported to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1-800-FDA-1088 and also tothe Celgene Corporation. It is of note that recent cases of thalidomide embryopathy result from sharing medication and were not detected by normal surveillance procedures. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether thalidomide enters human breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ May enhance the sedative activity of barbiturates, chlorpromazine, ethanol, and reserpine. Concomitant use of carbamazepine, griseofulvin, certain herbal supplements such as St. protease inhibitors, modafinil, penicillins, phenytoin, rifabutin, orrifampin with hormonal contraceptive agents may reduce the effectiveness of the contraception during and up to 1mo after discontinuation ofthese concomitant therapies.

Theophylline has two distinct actions on the airways of women with reversible airway obstruction: bronchodilation andnonbronchodilator prophylactic effects. Although 1% of pregnant women have asthma, it is often underrecognized and suboptimally treated. Severe, uncontrolled asthma increases thelikelihood of maternal and fetal morbidity and death. Pharmacologic therapy is often necessary during pregnancy. Women with well-controlled asthma during pregnancy haveoutcomes as good as those of their nonasthmatic peers. Itsclearance of theophylline is altered little during either the 1st and 2nd trimesters, but significantly decreased in the 3rd trimesterand puerperium. Benefit:risk considerations suggest inhaledasthma medications such as are first-line agents, with theophylline a second-line agent for the treatment of asthma during pregnancy. The risk of exacerbation ishigh immediately postpartum, but overall severity usually revertsto preconception levels postpartum. Asthma tends to follow a similar course in subsequent pregnancies. Side effects include arrhythmia, seizures, respiratory arrest, N/V, headache, insomnia, rash, alopecia, flushing, fever, nervousness,agitation, tremor, tachycardia, and palpitations. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. Theophylline crosses the human placenta, reaching an F:M ratio of unity in a brief time. It dilates in vitro constricted placental arteries. While the limited rat teratogen studies are reassuring,theophylline producing more than 5 /C2the recommended human therapeutic concentration causes fetal toxicity, cleft palate, andskeletal malformations in rabbits. In the chick (a poor model for humans), theophylline is associated with an increased prevalence of CV malformations. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Theophylline enters human breast milk, achieving an M:P ratio between 0.6 and 0.9. It can cause irritability in the nursing newborn, presumably because of the long neonatal t/2. Neonataltoxicity is unlikely. Women who choose to breastfeed should monitor their children's behavior closely. #Drug Interactions ................ The clinician should not assume that a drug does not interact with theophylline if it is not listed here. Individual patients may experience larger changes in serum theophylline concentrations than the value listed.Blocks adenosine receptors, often necessitating a higher dose of adenosine to achieve the desired effect. A single large dose of ethanol (3ml/kg of whiskey) decreasestheophylline clearance by as much as 1=3for up to 24h. Allopurinol decrease theophylline clearance by 25%. increase theophyilline clearance and tacrine each decrease theophylline clearance inhibiting CYP1A2, causing levels to rise by 40-100%. Enoxacin may increase the theophylline level by the same mechanism by more than 300%. 1091Clarithromycin anderythromycin decrease theophylline clearance by to rise 25-35%. Erythromycin steady-state serum levels decrease by a similar amount. A larger dose of benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, flurazepam, lorazepam ) may be required to produce the desired level of sedation as they increase CNS concentrations of adenosine and theophylline blocks adenosine receptors. Caution is indicated should the theophylline be discontinued. Disulfiram, mexiletine, andverapamil decrease levelsmay rise 50%.Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives decrease theophylline clearance in a dose-dependent fashion, raising levels by as muchas 30%. The effect of progesterone ontheophylline clearance is unknown.Use with halothane increases the risk of ventricular arrythmias. Human recombinant interferon alfa-2a decreases clearance and almost doubles serum theophylline levels. Isoproterenol (IV) increases clearance, lowering levels by some 20%.Increases renal lithium clearance, necessitating a 40-60% increase in the dose of lithium. Methotrexate decreases theophylline clearance and levels may rise more than 20%.Moricizine increases clearance, decreasing levels by 25%. May antagonize nondepolarizing blocking agents(e.g., thiabendazole, andticlopidine causing levels 30-200%. Phenytoin increases theophylline clearance by increasing microsomal enzyme phenytoin absorption. As theophylline andphenytoin levels decrease about 40%. Rifampin increases clearance by increasing CYP1A2 and 3A3 activity, causing a 20-40% decrease in the theophylline level.

Pure thiamine deficiency is rare. Multiple vitamin deficiencies should be suspected in any case of dietary inadequacy. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of thiamine in pregnant women. Despite its inclusion in prenatal vitamins, thiamine deficiency is not uncommon during pregnancy. Wernicke's encephalopathy is reported during pregnancy, often in association with hyperemesis. When given as part of a multivitamin prenatal supplement, thiamine improves weight gain among HIV-infected women. Side effects include cyanosis, angioedema, pruritus, urticaria, warmth, and injection site reaction. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. Thiamine is actively transported across the human placenta, reaching an F:M ratio of 10. Thus, maternal supplementation is unlikely to alter the fetal thiamine to any clinically relevant extent. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Thiamine enters human breast milk, and maternal supplementation increases milk content.

Thromboembolic disease remains a major cause of pregnancymorbidity and death. Tinzaparin is an LMWH extracted from pig. It is at least as effective as unfractionated heparin for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic disease. Post-cesarean section,it reduces thrombin-antithrombin complex concentration moreeffectively than enoxaparin. It is unknown whether that enhancement means improved prophylaxis. Most anesthesiologists prefer to wait 24h after the last dose of tinzaparin (even if given 175U/kg qd) before induction of neuraxial anesthesia. Because the clearance of other LMWHs are increased by pregnancy, it is probably best to monitor anti-Xa activity at least once per trimester and administer the drug in 2 divided doses beginning with250IU/kg qd. In support of this conclusion, one study noted thatwomen receiving tinzaparin (50IU/kg) frequently had peak (4h) anti-Xa levels <0.1IU/ml and that 46% of these patients required dose adjustment. Likewise, anti-Xa activity was found to be lowover the 24h period. A starting dose of 75IU/kg, once daily, gavegreater anti-Xa cover over the 24h period. The findings suggest the pharmacokinetics of tinzaparin are affected by pregnancy. Side effects include hemorrhage, hematoma, skin necrosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, injection site reaction, andelevated LFTs. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Tinzaparin does not cross the human placenta. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of 1104teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

They reveal some evidence of prolonged pregnancy and embryotoxicity. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. It is unknown whether tizanidine enters human breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Ethanol increased the AUC of tizanidine by some 20% while also increasing its C maxby approximately 15%. This increase was associated with an increase in side effects. The CNS depressanteffects of tizanidine and ethanol are additive. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic datasuggests that women also taking oral contraceptives have 50%lower clearance of tizanidine. Rofecoxib may potentiate the adverse effects of tizanidine. Eight case reports of a potential rofecoxib -tizanidine drug interaction have been identified in post-marketing safety reports. Most of theadverse events involved the nervous system (e.g., hallucinations, psychosis, somnolence, hypotonia) and the CV system (e.g., hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia). In all cases, the symptomsresolved following discontinuation of tizanidine, rofecoxib, or both. Rechallenges were not performed.

Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. It is unknown whether tobramycin crosses the human placenta. Other aminoglycoside antibiotics do cross, and there are reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness after streptomycin. Serious side effects to mother, fetus, or newborn are not reported after treatment with other aminoglycosides.Tobramycin likely poses no greater risk than gentamicin to the fetus. Systemic levels are much lower after nebulizer or ophthalmicadministration compared to parenteral route. In the rat,tobramycin accumulates in the placenta. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despitethe use of doses higher than those used clinically. The highestdoses caused excess maternal toxicity with increased fetal wastage. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Small amounts of tobramycin are excreted into human breast milk. Milk levels ranged from undetectable to0.5mcg/ml in a study of 5 women treated with 80mg IM.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of tolbutamide in pregnant women. Efficient placental transport renders it a poorselection during pregnancy. Side effects include aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow suppression, hypoglycemia, jaundice, leukopenia, SIADH, disulfiram -like reaction, headache, constipation, dizziness, rash, and photosensitivity. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Tolbutamide crosses the human placenta relatively efficiently compared to glyburide. The fetal pancreas is responsive. Prolonged and severe hypoglycemia (4-10d) isreported in neonates born to mothers receiving a sulfonylurea atthe time of delivery. This is more frequent with agents having a prolonged t/2. If tolbutamide is used during pregnancy, it should be discontinued at least 2w before the expected delivery date. Tolbutamide is teratogenic in rats, associated with an increased prevalence of ocular and bony abnormalities at doses 25-100 /C2 the MRHD.

If a women wishes to take OCPs, the preparation should contain at least 50mcg of ethinyl estradiol. Levonorgestrel implants are contraindicated because of the increased risk of contraceptive failure. Further, it is recommendedthatmedroxyprogesterone injections be given q10w rather than q12w. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies oftopiramate in pregnant women. Folate supplementation preconception is prudent. As for most psychotropic drugs,monotherapy and the lowest effective quantity given in divided doses to minimize the peaks may minimize the risks. Many recommend vitamin K (10mg PO qd) be given the last 4w ofpregnancy for women taking hepatic enzyme-inducing 1113anticonvulsants such as topiramate. The scientific support for this practice is weak. Side effects include nephrolithiasis, acute myopia, secondary angle-closure glaucoma, dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, language memory difficulty, psychomotor slowing, nervousness, ataxia, nystagmus, depression, diplopia, mood disturbances, paresthesias, tremor, weight loss, confusion, abdominal pain,agitation, and URI. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Topiramate readily crosses the human placenta, reaching F:M ratios approaching unity. There is too little humanexperience where topiramate is a teratogen in rodents. Preliminary after market data suggest an increase in majorcongenital malformations, especially oral clefts. There is a dose-dependent increase in the prevalence of craniofacial and limbmalformations, and IUGR, even at doses a fraction of the MRHD. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

Tramadol is a centrally acting analgesic. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of tramadol in pregnant women. There are a few studies using it intrathecally. A single study comparing tramadol with meperidine for labor analgesia concluded it created less maternal sedation and fetal respiratory depression. Tramadol reduces postanesthetic shivering with a lower frequency of somnolence than meperidine. There is no evidence of a difference between meperidine andtramadol in terms of pain relief, interval to delivery, or instrumental oroperative delivery. It is an excellent oral agent for the relief of significant postoperative pain. However, it is no better than ibuprofen for the treatment of postabortal pain. In fact, ibuprofen is somewhat more effective at reducing pain 30min after surgical abortion. 1116Side effects include dependency, seizures, angioedema, nervousness, anxiety, agitation, euphoria, tremor, spasticity, visual disturbances, incoordination, anorexia, rash, and vasodilation. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Tramadol crosses the human placenta, achieving an F:M ratio of 0.83 with the concentrations approaching unity. Chronic use during pregnancy may lead to physical dependenceand postpartum withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. Rodent studies are generally reassuring, revealing only embryo and maternal toxicity at high concentrations, and no teratogenicityor IUGR. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... A small amount of tramadol enters human breast milk. The estimated relative infant dose of 2.88% is low. #Drug Interactions ................ Use with carbamazepine may significantly reduce analgesic effect. Since carbamazepine increases tramadol metabolism and because of the seizure risk associated with tramadol, their use together is not recommended. Quinidine is a selective inhibitor of CYP2D6; its use results in increased concentrations of tramadol (50-60%) and reduced concentrations of M1 (50-60%). Other CYP2D6 inhibitors include amitriptyline, fluoxetine, andparoxetine.

If oligohydramnios is observed, be discontinued unless considered lifesaving. Antenatalsurveillance (e.g., BPP) may be appropriate, depending upon the week of pregnancy. Oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Neonates exposed in utero should be closely observed for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. Rodent and primate studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether trandolapril enters human breast milk. It is excreted into rodent milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Use with cimetidine led to an increase of about 44% in C max fortrandolapril, but no difference in the pharmacokinetics of trandolaprilat or in ACE inhibition.Use with furosemide led to an increase of about 25% in the renal clearance of trandolaprilat, but no effect was seen on thepharmacokinetics of furosemide or trandolaprilat or on ACE inhibition. Patients on diuretics, especially those on recentlyinstituted diuretic therapy, may experience an excessive reduction 1118of BP after initiation of therapy with trandolapril. This possibility may be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or cautiously increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with trandolapril. If it is not possible to discontinue the diuretic, the starting dose of trandolapril should be reduced.

Some retinoid agents can be highly toxic to the fetus. Within 7d of tretinoin therapy, a blood or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/L should be performed.When possible, tretinoin should be delayed until a negative result from this test is obtained. When a delay is not possible, thepatient should be placed on two reliable forms of contraception.Pregnancy testing and contraception counseling should be repeated monthly throughout the period of tretinoin treatment. Tretinoin inhibits in vitro decidualization of endometrial stroma. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of tretinoin in pregnant women. The published experience consists of case reports of acute promyelocytic leukemia.Side effects include peeling, erythema, and after oral therapy. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. Tretinoin crosses the human placenta. Epidemiologic data are reassuring: 106 pregnant women with 1st trimester exposure to topical tretinoin were reported between 1983 and 2003 and prospectively followed. Birth outcomes were compared to 389 similarly followed women without exposure. There were no significant differences between groups in the proportion ofpregnancies ending in spontaneous abortion, or infants with majorstructural defects. The groups were similar in gestation and size at birth. The prevalence of one or more retinoic acid-specific minor malformations did not differ between groups. Unfortunately, fewerthan 10 neonates have been born to women treated with oraltretinoin during pregnancy (virtually all after the 1st trimester) for acute promyelocytic leukemia. All had normal growth withoutapparent complications. Tretinoin is a teratogen in rodents and primates when given orally. Reported defects in these species include abnormalities of the CNS, musculoskeletal system, ear, eye, thymus, and great vessels; facial dysmorphia; cleft palate; and PTHdeficiency. The offspring of diabetic mice are more prone todevelop caudal regression after tretinoin exposure. The teratogenic effect of topically applied drug is less clear and is likely low if usedas directed. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether tretinoin enters human breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Metabolized by the hepatic diltiazem, erythromycin, ketoconazole, and verapamil. To date there are no data to indicate whether use with these medications increases or decreases either efficacy or toxicity.Caution should be exercised when the topical form is used withtopical OTC acne preparations containing benzoyl peroxide, resorcinol, salicylic acid, or sulfur. #References .........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of triamcinolone in pregnant women. Triamcinolone appears to be at least as efficacious for the treatment of asthma during pregnancy asbeclomethasone. The suggestion that chronic topical application might lead to IUGR has yet to be confirmed by others. It is lesslikely the maternal systemic concentration will reach a clinically relevant level after either topical or inhalational use. In one study, POtriamcinolone caused a loss of circadian rhythms of cortisol, ACTH, and unconjugated patterns of FHR. No differences inhormonal and biophysical parameters were found after the end oftreatment, suggesting the inhibition of fetal and maternal adrenalglands modifies FHR patterns. Side effects vary by route of use and include adrenal insufficiency (long-term therapy [LT]), steroid psychosis (LT), immunosuppression (LT), menstrual irregularities, peptic ulcer,CHF, osteoporosis (LT), cataracts, N/V, dyspepsia, appetite change, edema, headache, dizziness, mood swings, insomnia, anxiety, sinusitis, hypertension, pharyngitis, oral candidiasis,eczema, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, ecchymoses, acne, atrophy, and impaired wound healing. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether triamcinolone crosses the human placenta. However, it does cross the nonhuman primateplacenta and is relatively resistant to placental metabolism.The resulting F:M ratio approximates 0.6. Epidemiologic evidenceis reassuring. Further, its administration to nonhuman primates at doses 5-60 /C2(10mg/kg) the MRHD increases the prevalence of IUGR and craniofacial defects. The extensive fetoplacental metabolism of cortisol to inactive metabolites and the resistance oftriamcinolone to metabolic conversion result in greater triamcinolone than cortisol exposure. Triamcinolone also crosses the rodent placenta, and its fetal t/2 is significantly prolongedcompared to cortisol. In several rodent models, triamcinolone causes cleft lip and palate, whereas cortisol does not. While there is no epidemiologic evidence suggesting PO triamcinolone is a teratogen in humans, prescribing caution especially during the1st trimester seems prudent. It is less likely the maternal systemic concentration will reach a clinically relevant level after either topical or inhalational use. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether triamcinolone enters human breast milk.

Triamterene has a unique mode of action. In addition to its diuretic effect, triamterene is also a folate antagonist. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of triamterene in pregnant women.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Triamterene rapidly crosses the human placenta, reaching F:M levels approaching unity. Epidemiologic studies suggest that folate antagonists, including triamterene, may increase the risk not only of NTDs, but also of CV defects, oral 1126clefts, and urinary tract defects. It crosses the rodent placenta. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether triamterene enters human breast milk. It is excreted into rodent milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Diuretic-induced sodium loss may reduce the renal clearance oflithium and increase serum lithium levels with risk of lithium toxicity. Patients should be monitored closely and the lithium dose adjusted as necessary. A possible interaction resulting in acute renal failure has been reported when used with an NSAID. Caution is advised.May potentiate antihypertensive medication, other diuretics,preanesthetic and anesthetic agents, and skeletal muscle relaxants (nondepolarizing). Use cautiously with ACEIs due to an increased risk ofhyperkalemia. The following may promote serum potassium accumulation and possibly result in hyperkalemia: blood from blood bank(may contain up to 30mEq of potassium/L of plasma or up to65mEq/L of whole blood when stored for more than 10d); low-salt milk (may contain up to 60mEq of potassium/L); potassium-containing medications (such as parenteral penicillinG potassium); and salt substitutes (most contain substantialamounts of potassium).

A decreased dose of trimipramine may be required if cimetidine therapy is initiated and an increased dose if cimetidine is discontinued. Use with ethanol may exaggerate the CNS effects. Particular care should be exercised when it is necessary to administer TCAs with sympathomimetic amines, local decongestants, local anesthetics containing epinephrine, atropine, or drugs with an anticholinergic effect. In resistant cases ofdepression in adults, a dose of 2.5mg/kg/d may have to be exceeded.

Poor metabolizershave higher than expected plasma concentrations of TCAs.Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8- fold increase in the AUC).Some drugs inhibit the activity of CYP2D6 and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic whengiven one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. Thedrugs include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (e.g., cimetidine, quinidine ) and many that ) inhibit CYP2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. Caution is indicated in the use of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one classto the other. Use with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome CYP2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the TCA or theother drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs iswithdrawn, an increased dose of the TCA may be required. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels. #References .........................

Long-acting agents such as tubocurarine orpancuronium have generally been abandoned by anesthesiologists/intensivists in favor syntheticshort- to intermediate-acting agents (e.g., cisatracurium, rocuronium, vecuronium ) that have lesser side effect (e.g., histamine release, tachycardia) profiles.Side effects include histamine release characterized by erythema, edema, skin rash, flushing, tachycardia, arterial hypotension, arrhythmias, bradycardia, and prolonged apnea. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Placental transfer of tubocurarine is greater than atracurium, with an F:M ratio of 0.09 for atracurium and 0.12 for tubocurarine (p<0.05). However, it may be more rapidly cleared by the neonate. Tubocurarine is well-tolerated by the neonate if used during cesarean delivery, provided theinterval between drug and delivery is short (1-10min). Onewoman treated for tetanus at 10-12w with tubocurarine for 10d delivered a term infant with joint contractures. Tubocurarine is administered directly to the fetus (3 or 1.5mg/kg SEFW IM/IV)to facilitate fetal therapeutic efforts. It lowers HR and BP incomparison to pancuronium. The duration of action of tubocurarine is directly related to the relative sensitivities of the different muscle groups, which are ranked from most sensitive toleast sensitive as extraocular muscles, nuchal muscle, and diaphragm. Rodent studies reveal an increase in deformations consistent with absent fetal muscle tone. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether tubocurarine enters human breast milk. However, considering the indication and dosing, one-time tubocurarine use is unlikely to pose a clinically significant risk to the breastfeeding neonate. 1139#Drug Interactions ................ High action.IVclindamycin plus low pseudocholinesterase levels and abnormal hepatic tests have been associated with prolongedapnea. The patient should be observed closely for respiratorydepression if muscle relaxants and antibiotics that may blockneuromuscular transmission must be administered together. Use with volatile liquid relatedenhancement of neuromuscular blockade and an increase in the duration of action. Synergism has been noted when nondepolarizing muscle relaxants(e.g., gallamine, tubocurarine ) are injected concurrently. Synergistic or antagonistic effects may result when depolarizing and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants (e.g., succinylcholine, tubocurarine ) are administered consecutively. The extent and type of interaction depends on the doses and the sequence andtiming of injections. Potentiation of the neuromuscular blockade has been observedin preeclamptic women treated with magnesium sulfate prior to cesarean delivery. Opiate analgesics may enhance respiratory depression. Potassium-depleting sensitivity to neuromuscular blockingagents. Adequate potassium levels should be confirmed prior toelective surgery. Clinical experience strongly suggests that quinidine injected shortly after recovery causes recurrent paralysis in patients who received injections of either depolarizing or nondepolarizingmuscle relaxants during surgery. Calcium salts, diazepam, high doses of lidocaine, lithium, MAOIs, propranolol, quinine, and trimethaphan may intensify curare-containing preparations. #References .........................

Urea crosses the human placenta. Intra-amniotic injection of urea (80-120g) in combination with a prostaglandin is used for 2nd and 3rd trimester termination. The urea is typically lethal when given prior to skin keratinization. Rodentteratogenicity studies have not been conducted. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. Urea likely enters human breast milk, but the effect of its use for the listedindications has not been studied. However, most of the urea ingested by the infant is not bioavailable. Thus any increase in milk urea from maternal treatment should be clinically irrelevant. #Drug Interactions ................

Urokinase is produced by the kidney and excreted in the urine. Urokinase treatment must be instituted as soon as possible after onset of PE, and no later than 7d. Therapy should be instituted within 6h of symptom onset if used to treat coronary arterythrombosis associated with an evolving transmural MI. Any delay instituting lytic therapy, even to evaluate the effect of heparin, decreases the potential for optimal efficacy. The diagnosis of a thromboembolus should always be confirmed by objective testing.Concurrent use of anticoagulants with IV administration of urokinase is not recommended except as noted. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of urokinase in pregnant women. The published literature consists of case reportsusing urokinase to treat MI, PE, and cerebral and ovarian vein thrombosis either during pregnancy or in the puerperium. Hemorrhage is common during pregnancy. In one series of 8pregnant women with acute ischemic stroke treated, 2 suffered extracranial and 2 asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhages. Side effects include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmia, rash, bronchospasm, and injection site phlebitis. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether urokinase crosses the human placenta. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing noevidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety ..........

Plasminogen and plasminogen activator are normal components of breast milk. Considering the indications anddosing, one-time urokinase use is unlikely to pose a clinically significant risk to the breastfeeding neonate. 1142#Drug Interactions ................ Drugs that alter platelet function (e.g., aspirin, indomethacin, phenylbutazone ) should not be used. Although heparin is recommended prior to intracoronary use, neither oral anticoagulants nor heparin should be used with large doses of urokinase such as those used for PE because of the risk of hemorrhage. #References .........................

Small series suggest it can be effective for the treatment of cholestasis of pregnancy (approximately 16mg/kg). Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is associated with increased perinatal morbidity andmortality. Pruritus and postpartum hemorrhage are the main causes of maternal morbidity. Current management focuses on regular fetal and maternal monitoring and delivery at fetalmaturity. However, a decrease in bile acids does not necessarilyimply improved fetal outcome, and planned delivery remains prudent. One modest RCT concluded its combined use with S-adenosyl- L-methionine improved maternal responses. There is a case report of a woman with primary biliary cirrhosis treatedthroughout pregnancy. Ursodiol was effective, though a preterm cesarean delivery was required for uteroplacental dysfunction.Side effects include N/V, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, alopecia, leukopenia, and URI symptoms. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Ursodiol apparently does not cross the human placenta. It does, however, induce placental MRP2 expression, and reduce bilirubin and bile acid levels in umbilical cord blood. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Ursodiol does not enter human breast Bile acid-sequestering agents Aluminum-based antacids adsorb bile acids in vitro and may be expected to interfere with ursodiol in the same manner as the bile acid-sequestering agents.Clofibrate, estrogens, and oral contraceptives (and perhaps other lipid-lowering drugs) increase hepatic cholesterol secretion, encourage cholesterol gallstone formation, and may counteract the effectiveness of ursodiol. #References .........................

After ingestion, valacyclovir is metabolized to and actually enhances acyclovir bioavailability. It is effective and well tolerated for HSV suppression for up to 10y of continuo us use. Neonatal herpes affects 1/15,000 newborns. The vast majority of infected infants are born to women with a primary infection during pregnancy. While there are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of valacyclovir in pregnant women, it is used extensiv ely for the listed indications. If initiated prophylactically at 36w, acyclovir reduces both the risk of recurrence and the frequency of a positive cervical culture at deliveryin women who experience either a primary infection or at least onesecondary episode during pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence todetermine if antiviral prophylaxis reduces the incidence of neonatal herpes. However, patients should be counseled that antenatal antiviral prophylaxis reduces viral shedding and recurrences atdelivery and reduces the need for cesarean delivery for genital herpes. Side effects include renal failure, dysmenorrhea, N/V, headache, dizziness, arthralgia, depression, facial edema, hypertension, tachycardia, and erythema multiforme. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or w ell-controlled studies in human fetuses. Valacyclovir crosses the human placenta. Maternal oral administration of valacyclovir leads to therapeutic concentrations in the maternal and fetal compartments, and in the instance of CMV, a decrease in the fetal viral load. However, it is unknown whether this decrease in CMV number is associated with decreased perinatal damage. Acyclovir crosses the rodent placenta. Post-marketing surveys suggest no increased frequency of birth defects. Rodentstudies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Valacyclovir is converted to acyclovir, which enters human breast milk. However, the amount of acyclovir in breast milk during valacyclovir administration is <5% of the dose used to treat neonates. #Drug Interactions ................

Valdecoxib is an NSAID with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. In general, the COX-2 inhibitors are associated with a lower incidence of GI upset but potentially an increase in MI. Valdecoxib provides effective relief o f dysmenorrhea, but does not appear to be more effective than alt ernative, nonselective NSAIDs. The manufacturer removed the drug from the US market after 1146concerns were raised about possible increased risks of MI and CVA. There is no published experience with valdecoxib during pregnancy. Its addition after cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia withintrathecal morphine does not improve outcome. It has no effect on the timing of onset of rodent labor. Side effects include GI bleeding or ulceration, esophagitis, bronchospasm, hypertension, CHF, hepatotoxicity, renal papillary necrosis, anemia, dyspepsia, abdominal pain,N/V, diarrhea, dizziness, and peripheral edema. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. It is unknown whether valdecoxib crosses the human placenta. Other NSAIDs do cross and are associated with gastroschisis (1st trimester exposure), oligohydramnios, and ductal constriction. Valdecoxib increases the risk of skeletal malformations in some rodents when given at >70/C2the MRHD. IUGR is noted with doses >5/C2the MRHD. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether valdecoxib enters human breast milk. It is found in rodent milk. #Drug Interactions ................ Predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 and 2C9. It is a moderateinhibitor of CYP2C19 and 2C9, and a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 and 3A4. Use with aspirin may result in an increased risk of GI ulceration and complications. Because of its lack of antiplatelet effect,valdecoxib is not a substitute for aspirin for CV prophylaxis. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACEIs.Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, revealthat NSAIDs may reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed toinhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.Plasma levels are reduced by 27% when used with phenytoin (a CYP3A4 inducer). Patients already stabilized on valdecoxib should be closely monitored for loss of symptom control withphenytoin co-administration. Use with dextromethorphan, primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by 3A4, caused significantly increased dextromethorphan levels, suggesting valdecoxib is a weak inhibitor of 2D6. However, a dose adjustment is not necessary. Decreases lithium serum clearance (25%) and renal clearance (30%), with a 34% higher serum exposure compared to lithium alone. Lithium serum concentrations should be monitored closely.Fluconazole andketoconazole, predominantly CYP3A4 AUC by 46%. Drugs whose absorption is sensitive to pH may be negatively impacted by concomitant administration of omeprazole andvaldecoxib. However, because higher doses (up to 360mg qd) of omeprazole are tolerated in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients, no dose adjustment for omeprazole is recommended at current doses. Increases diazepam levels by 28%. Although the magnitude of change is not sufficient to warrant a dose adjustment, patients mayexperience enhanced sedative side effects. #References .........................

Patients planning pregnancy should be counseled on the risks and the importance of periconceptional folate supplementation.Side effects include potentially fatal hepatotoxicity, peripheral edema, petechiae, and respiratory #Fetal Considerations ........... Valproate is a recognized human teratogen, increasing the relative risk by a factor of 4 with an overall prevalence of about 6%. Therisk is compounded by a low serum folate. Valproate is rapidly and actively transported across the human placenta, reaching an F:M ratio exceeding 2. Recent pregnancy databases suggest valproate is significantly more teratogenic than carbamazepine, and the combination of valproate andlamotrigine is particularly teratogenic. For unknown reasons, valproate accumulates in the fetal plasma. A distinct facial appearance, coupled with a clusterof minor and major anomalies and CNS dysfunction, characterizethefetal valproate syndrome. The likelihood of the offspring being affected is dose-dependent. Ten percent die in infancy, and 1/4survivors have either developmental deficits or mentalretardation. Affected fetuses may have an increased nuchaltranslucency measurement. A fetal medicine specialist should 1149evaluate women taking valproate during pregnancy. As for most psychotropic drugs, monotherapy and the lowest effective quantity given in divided doses to minimize the peaks can theoretically minimize the risks. In one recent study, theoutcomes of 154 valproate -exposed pregnancies (96% at least in the 1st trimester) were compared with those of 1315 unexposedpregnancies. The major anomaly rate in the valproate group exposed in the 1st trimester was higher than controls afterexclusion of genetic or cytogenetic anomalies (6.7% vs. 2.5%, relative risk [RR] = 2.66). Five of the 8 major anomalies in the valproate group were CV, 2/8 were mental retardation, 2/5 male infants with major anomalies had hypospadias and 3/8 weresuspected of having fetal valproate syndrome. A daily dose >1000mg was associated with the highest teratogenic risk (RR = 8.72). In the subgroup exposed to polytherapy, there was a 4-foldincrease in the rate of major anomalies compared with controls.All major anomalies were in the group treated for epilepsy. In another study, those exposed to polytherapy in utero had significantly lower developmental quotients than those exposed to monotherapy. Polytherapy was a stronger predictor of lower developmental quotients than dose. Compared with carbamazepine monotherapy, valproate monotherapy was associated with significantly lower mental and motordevelopmental scores. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Valproate enters human breast milk, but the neonatal concentration is <10% of the maternal. #Drug Interactions ................ The following information about the potential for severalcommonly prescribed medications to alter valproatepharmacokinetics is not exhaustive nor could it be, since new interactions are continuously being reported. Drugs that affect the level of expression of hepatic enzymes,particularly those that elevate levels of glucuronosyltransferases,may increase clearance. For example, carbamazepine, phenobarbital (orprimidone ), and phenytoin can double valproate clearance. Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer t/2s and higher concentrations than patients receivingpolytherapy with AEDs. Aspirin at antipyretic doses may decrease protein binding and inhibit valproate metabolism. Valproate free fraction was increased 4-fold in the presence of aspirin compared to valproate alone. Caution is indicated when using aspirin. Felbamate increased the mean valproate peak level by 35-50% depending on the dose of felbamate. A decrease in the valproate dose may be necessary.Rifampin may increase valproate clearance by some 40% and may necessitate a dose adjustment. May decrease the clearance of both amitriptyline by 20% and nortriptyline by 30%. Use of valproate andamitriptyline has rarely been associated with toxicity. Monitoring of amitriptyline levels should be considered and consideration given to loweringthe dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline. Decreases carbamazepine levels 17% 10,11- epoxide metabolite by 45%.Use with clonazepam may induce absence status in patients with a history of absence-type seizures. Displaces diazepam from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its metabolism, resulting in an almost doubling of the diazepam free fraction. Increases by 25% the elimination t/2 of ethosuximide and decreases its total clearance by some 15%. Patients using both agents, 1150especially along with other AEDs, should be monitored for changes in the serum concentrations of both drugs. Increases the elimination t/2 of lamotrigine by 165%. The lamotrigine dose should be reduced. Serious skin reactions (such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis)have been reported in association with this combination. Increases the t/2 of phenobarbital by 50% and decreased the plasma clearance by 1=3. The fraction of phenobarbital excreted unchanged increases by 50%. All patients receiving barbiturate therapy should be closely monitored for neurologic toxicity. Serum barbiturate levelsshould be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosedecreased as appropriate. Primidone, which is metabolized to a barbiturate, may have a similar interaction with valproate. Displaces phenytoin from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic metabolism, increasing the free fraction some60%. Total plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution ofphenytoin increase 30% in the presence of valproate. As there have been reports of breakthrough seizures occurring with this combination, the dose of phenytoin should be adjusted as clinically required.The clearance of zidovudine was decreased by 38% in Nakamura Ushigome Koyabu et al.

Valsartan has no significant advantages over similar agents in its class for which there is more experience. Nor has it beendemonstrated to reduce the complications of arterial hypertension. There are no adequate reports or well-controlledstudies of valsartan in pregnant women. Only a half dozen pregnancy exposures are reported, some with poor outcomes typical of this drug class. Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system should be avoided during pregnancy because of theirfetal implications. Side effects include angioedema, severe hypotension, hyperkalemia, URI symptoms, dizziness, fatigue, dyspepsia, back pain, and diarrhea. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensinsystem can cause perinatal morbidity and death. Adverseoutcomes are reported for valsartan suggesting it crosses the human placenta. Drugs that inhibit the fetal renin-angiotensinsystem are now recognized to be potentially teratogenicthroughout gestation; the risks are greatest after the 1st trimester. The mechanisms may well be different for ACEIs and AT-1 receptor antagonists. In the 2nd and 3rd morbidityincludes hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, andreversible or be associated with limb contractures, craniofacial deformation, and hypoplastic lung development. Rarely, an alternative drug is notavailable. In these cases, the women should be counseled on thehazards, and serial ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, the valsartan should be discontinued unless lifesaving for the mother. Antenatal surveillance may be appropriatedepending upon gestation. Oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether valsartan enters human breast milk. #Drug Interactions ................ As with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., amiloride, spironolactone, triamterene ), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may increase serum potassium and, inheart failure, N, Carlier 3rd trimesters)Lactation Category: U/C15Valsartan should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if the benefit justifies the potential perinatal risk. /C15Women should be counseled on the risks and switched to adifferent class of antihypertensives prior to conception orduring the 1st trimester. /C15There are alternative agents for which there is more experience regarding use during pregnancy and lactation.

Vancomycin is most commonly used for the treatment of MRSA infections. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of vancomycin in pregnant women. In one series, adverse events were common, suggesting that longer infusion times andweight-adjusted doses should be used. It is used as a second-line agent for the treatment of postpartum endomyometritis, and as a first-line agent and alternative to metronidazole for the treatment ofC. difficile diarrhea. Other applications during pregnancy include listeriosis and bacterial endocarditis in IV drug users.Side syndrome, and phlebitis. #Fetal ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studiesin human fetuses. Vancomycin crosses the human placenta in a predictable manner, achieving concentrations that exceedthe usual GBS inhibitory level. In contrast, transplacental passageofvancomycin was minimal in an ex vivo human placental perfusion model, yielding no detectable accumulation. There is no obvious explanation. Concern that vancomycin exposure might cause ototoxicity has not been substantiated. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGRdespite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Vancomycin enters human breast milk, but the kinetics remain to be elucidated. Considering the poor oral absorption, it is unlikely the breastfed neonate would ingest a clinically relevant amount. #Drug Interactions ................ Use with anesthetic agents has been associated with erythema andhistamine-like flushing and anaphylactoid reactions.Concurrent and/or sequential systemic or of Y, et Dis 1993; VL, Dotters DJ, RG.

Varicella is a cause of significant maternal and fetal morbidityand mortality. The attack rate of natural varicella after household exposure among healthy susceptible people approaches 90%.Varicella vaccine is a live, attenuated preparation, and as such is usually contraindicated during pregnancy. Most adverse eventsassociated with varicella vaccine are minor, and serious complications rare. If vaccine virus transmission occurs, it doesso at a very low rate and possibly without recognizable clinical disease. Most complications are instead associated with wild-type virus. Seventy percent of women in North America who do notremember having childhood varicella are actually immune. It iswise to test women of reproductive age planning pregnancy, and selectively immunize preconception if indicated. It is estimated that selective serologic screening of pregnant women withpostpartum vaccination of susceptible women is cost-effective and would prevent half the cases of congenital varicella. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of varicella vaccine in pregnant women. Inadvertent administration during pregnancyproduces maternal immunity. There are reports of its erroneous administration when varicella-zoster immune globulin was ordered. Side effects include fever, injection site reactions, vesicular lesions, upper respiratory illness, headache, fatigue, cough, myalgia, disturbed sleep, N/V, malaise, diarrhea, stiff neck, irritability/ nervousness, lymphadenopathy, chills, eye complaints, abdominalpain, loss of appetite, arthralgia, otitis, itching, other rashes,constipation, lower respiratory illness, and allergic reactions. #Fetal Considerations ........... Varicella is a human teratogen. Abnormalities are usually relatedto CNS and peripheral nerve infection. They include skin lesions in dermatomal distribution, neurologic disease, and skeletal anomalies. The frequency of the syndrome is low (0.4-1.2% ofinfected cases) and gestational age related. There are no adequatereports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether the attenuated virus comprising the varicella vaccine crosses the human placenta. Wild-type virus does cross. Inadvertent immunization during pregnancy is unassociated with fetal pathology and is not a priori an indication for pregnancy termination. A voluntary Pregnancy Registry established by themanufacturer (Merck & Co.) recorded 981 women inadvertentlyvaccinated during the 1st trimester between 1995 and 2005, among whom the pregnancy outcomes were known. There was no evidence of congenital varicella syndrome and the major birthdefect rate was 3.7%. Longitudinal study demonstrates the fetalimmunologic response to congenital varicella may not be sustained. Molecular testing is recommended. Rodent teratogenicity studies have not been performed. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience with varicella vaccine in nursing women. According to one study by the manufacturer, itdoes not appear to enter human breast milk. Twelve women wereenrolled postpartum; all seroconverted after the first vaccine dose. Varicella DNA was not detected by polymerase chain reaction 1158(PCR) in any of the 217 postvaccination breast milk specimens. None of the infants was seropositive. Samples from 6 infants were tested for varicella-zoster virus DNA by PCR, and all were negative. In contrast, wild-type virus is excreted into humanbreast milk and can cause neonatal infection. #Drug Interactions ................ No clinically relevant interactions identified. #References ......................... Bohlke K, 1998; 92:535-45. Wilson E, Goss MA, Marin M, et al. J Infect Dis 2008; 197(Suppl2):S178-84.

Varicella-zoster immune globulin \u2014(VZIG; Varitect) International Brand Name\u2014 Varitect \u2014avoid intravascular injection #Maternal Considerations ..... Varicella is a cause of significant maternal and fetal morbidityand mortality. Varicella pneumonia is perhaps the most seriousmaternal complication, with mortality rates in excess of 10%.Current smokers and women with more than 100 lesions are at particularly high risk. There are no adequate reports or 1159well-controlled studies of varicella-zoster immune globulin in pregnant women. There is no evidence that administration to a susceptible, pregnant woman prevents viremia, fetal infection, or congenital varicella syndrome. The goal is to reduce the maternalsequelae of varicella rather than to prevent intrauterine infection. Women with no history of varicella and an unknown immune status should be tested as soon as the exposure is recognized.Seventy percent of women with no history of childhood varicellaare immune. Varicella-zoster immune globulin administered within 24h of exposure may reduce the severity of maternaldisease and is typically coupled with a course of acyclovir. The newer IV form achieves higher initial anti-varicella antibodiesthan the IM format. Though the effectiveness of this practice is unclear, case series indicate improved outcomes. Neonatal studies suggest the combination of immune globulin and acyclovir is more effective than monotherapy.Side effects include pain, redness, or swelling at the injection no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in humanfetuses. It is likely varicella-zoster immune globulin crosses the human placenta, but it is unknown whether such transfer conveysa level of passive immunity. Neonatal varicella is more likely severe when the maternal rash appears 5d prior to or 2d after delivery. These newborns should receive immune globulin immediately.Intravenous acyclovir is recommended for severely affected neonate. Unlike primary varicella infection in pregnancy, herpes zoster has not been documented to cause complications unless in the disseminated form. Newborns of women who develop varicella7d before or up to 28d after delivery should be given varicella- zoster immune globulin and possibly acyclovir. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. It is unknown whether varicella-zoster immune globulin enters human breast milk. Other IgG immunoglobulins do, and breastfeeding is encouraged as a potential source ofneonatal passive immunization. #Drug Interactions ................

V1 receptors are widely distributed in smooth muscle, includingthe myometrium. Women with dysmenorrhea have higher vasopressin levels. There are no adequate reports or well- controlled studies of vasopressin in pregnant women. Doses of vasopressin sufficient for an antidiuretic effect are unlikely to produce tonic uterine contractions deleterious to the fetus or threaten the continuation of the pregnancy. DDAVP is now the first choice for the treatment of diabetes insipidus and vonWillebrand's disease. It has also been used to treat gestational diabetes insipidus. Side effects include MI, water intoxication, arrhythmia, pain, flatulence, vertigo, rash, fever, and urticaria. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether vasopressin crosses the human placenta. Rodent teratogenicity studies have not been performed. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursingwomen. Little vasopressin enters human breast milk, and it does not pose a significant risk to the breastfeeding neonate. #Drug Interactions ................ Antidiuretic withcarbamazepine, chlorpropamide, clofibrate, fludrocortisone,TCAs, and urea. Antidiuretic effect may be decreased by demeclocycline, ethanol, heparin, lithium, and NE.

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of vecuronium in pregnant women. Popular during cesarean delivery as an adjunct to general anesthesia, its effect may be prolonged by the concurrent administration of magnesium sulfate and possibly clindamycin. Side effects include arrhythmia, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, and flushing. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. A limited amount of vecuronium crosses the human placenta within 5min, achieving a fetal concentration of 79ng/ml and an F:M ratio <0.07. It is administered directly to the fetus as an alternative to pancuronium during fetal procedures. In contrast to pancuronium, vecuronium has no effect on the FHR. This is an advantage for many procedures, buta potential drawback when used with fetal intravasculartransfusion. Fetal paralysis modestly reduces oxygen consumption. Rodent teratogenicity studies have not been performed. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It isunknown whether vecuronium enters human breast milk. Though similar to pancuronium, vercuronium's clearance is faster and t/2 shorter. Considering the indication and dosing, limited vecuronium use is unlikely to pose a clinically significant risk to the breastfeeding neonate. 1162#Drug Interactions ................ Succinylcholine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking effect and prolong its duration. If succinylcholine is to be used, the vecuronium should be delayed until the succinylcholine shows signs of wearing off. Other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., gallamine, metocurine, pancuronium, d-tubocurarine ) may have an additive effect when used together. There are insufficient data to support concomitant use of vecuronium and other competitive muscle relaxants in the same patient. Use with volatile inhalational anesthetics (e.g., enflurane, halothane, isoflurane ) will prominent with enflurane andisoflurane. High or produce neuromuscular block on their own.

Depression is common during and after pregnancy, but typically goes unrecognized. Pregnancy is not a reason a priori to discontinue psychotropic drugs. There are no adequate reportsor well-controlled studies of venlafaxine in pregnant women. In one woman, the elimination t/2 declined from 8.7h to 3.2h from the 1st to 3rd trimesters. Plasma levels likewise declined. Venlafaxine may be effective for the treatment of other disorders, including OCD, panic disorder, eating disorders,substance abuse, headaches, hot flashes, and chronic pain (including neuropathic pain). Side effects include seizures, headache, N/V, diarrhea, somnolence, anorexia, weight loss, constipation, anxiety, blurredvision, dizziness, dry mouth, insomnia, hypertension, and sweating. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Venlafaxine and its active metabolites cross the human placenta and enter the AF, where it is actuallyconcentrated. The M:F ratio approaches unity. Case-control studysuggests it is unassociated with an increased prevalence of fetal malformations. Neonatal behavioral signs are noted in exposed more frequently than unexposed newborns, but symptoms aredescribed as transient and self-limited. Premature infants couldbe more susceptible to the effects of SSRIs and venlafaxine. Rodent studies are generally reassuring, revealing no evidenceof teratogenicity despite the use of doses higher than those usedclinically. IUGR is seen in some models. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Venlafaxine enters human breast milk, achieving an M:P ratio approximating 2.5, and 2.7 for its active metabolite. Yet, themean total drug exposure of breastfed infants is only 6.4%. Though this level of exposure should be safe, measurable levels are achieved in about 1=2of the exposed neonates, suggesting the need for close monitoring. #Drug Interactions ................ Cimetidine inhibits first-pass metabolism, reducing the oral clearance of venlafaxine by about 43%; the AUC and C maxwere each increased by about 60%. However, for patients withpreexisting hypertension, and for elderly patients or patients with hepatic dysfunction, the interaction between venlafaxine and cimetidine is not known and potentially could be more pronounced. Caution is advised.Decreases the clearance of haloperidol by 42%, resulting in a 70% increase in the haloperidol AUC and an 88% increase in the haloperidol C max. Metabolized to its active metabolite by CYP2D6. Althoughimipramine partially inhibited the CYP2D6-mediated metabolism ofvenlafaxine, resulting in higher plasma levels of venlafaxine and lower plasma concentrations of its active metabolite, the total concentration of active compounds was unaffected. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required when venlafaxine is co-administered with a CYP2D6 inhibitor. Decreases the indinavir AUC 28% and its C max36%. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Based on the mechanism of action and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when venlafaxine is used with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems (e.g., 65:1228-34. 1164Einarson A, Fatoye B, Sarkar M, al.

In addition to the listed indications, verapamil is used in some locales for the treatment of bipolar disorder and for tocolysis in women with preterm labor. There are no adequate reports or well- controlled studies of verapamil in pregnant women. There is no randomized or case-control study using verapamil as the primary tocolytic, and the practice of combining it with a b-blocker has been appropriately abandoned. Isolated case reports describe itssuccessful use to treat maternal SVT. There are also rare reports ofits use to treat preeclamptic hypertension, though there is nosuggestion it offers advantages over other, more commonly used antihypertensives. Clearance is not altered in the rabbit pregnancy. Recently, a relationship between oral erythromycin and sudden cardiac death was reported in patients also receiving strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., diltiazem, nitroimidazole antifungal agents, troleandomycin ,verapamil ); each doubles, at least, the AUC for a CYP3A substrate. Caution is advised. Side effects include CHF, severe hypotension, AV block, severe bradycardia, constipation, dizziness, nausea, headache, edema,and fatigue. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Verapamil readily crosses the human placenta, achieving an F:M ratio of 0.7. Similar levels are found in AF. Relaxation of precontracted placental arteries by verapamil is reduced in placentas obtained from preeclamptic women.Doppler-determined fetal blood flow resistances in preeclampticwomen are unaltered by verapamil. Verapamil has been used as transplacental therapy for fetal SVT with unclear efficacy. Flecainide remains the drug of choice for SVT and fetal hydrops. Direct fetal administration has been reported with success. Verapamil crosses the rabbit placenta, though the kinetics remain to be elucidated. Rodent studies are generally reassuring, revealing no teratogenicity despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. However, IUGR and embryotoxicity occur. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in nursing women. Verapamil enters human breast milk, but the amount excreted is <0.05% and does not result in measurable levels in the nursing newborn. #Drug Interactions ................ Metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2C. Clinicallysignificant interactions have reported with inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin, ritonavir ) causing elevation of plasma verapamil, while inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampin ) have caused a lowering of plasma levels of verapamil. May increase blood ethanol concentrations and prolong itseffects.Use with b-adrenergic blockers may result in additive negative effects on HR, AV conduction, and/or cardiac contractility. Closesurveillance of clinical status should be maintained if combinedtherapy is used. Combined therapy should usually be avoided inpatients with AV conduction abnormalities and those with depressed LV function. 1166Asymptomatic bradycardia (36bpm) with a wandering atrial pacemaker has been observed in a patient receiving concomitant timolol (ab-adrenergic blocker) eyedrops and oral verapamil. May decrease in the clearance of metoprolol andpropranolol clearance; the effect on atenolol is variable. Chronic use with digoxin can increase serum digoxin levels by 50-75% during the first week of therapy, causing digitalis toxicity. The influence of verapamil ondigoxin kinetics is magnified in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. Maintenance anddigitalization doses should be reduced and the patient reassessed to avoid over- or underdigitalization.Use with oral antihypertensive agents (e.g., ACE inhibitors,b-blockers, diuretics, vasodilators) will usually have an additive effect on lowering BP. Patients receiving these combinationsshould be appropriately monitored.Until data on possible interactions between verapamil and disopyramide are obtained, disopyramide should not be administered within 48h before or 24h after verapamil administration. Use with flecainide may have additive negative inotropic effects and prolong AV conduction. In a small number of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (IHSS), concomitant use of verapamil andquinidine resulted in significant hypotension. Until further data are obtained, thiscombination should probably be avoided in women with IHSS. Counteracts the effects of quinidine on AV conduction. There has been a report of increased quinidine levels during verapamil therapy. Lithium toxicity has been reported with concomitant use; lithium levels have been observed sometimes to increase, sometimes to decrease, and sometimes to be unchanged.Patients receiving both drugs must be monitored carefully. May increase carbamazepine concentrations, producing diplopia, headache, ataxia, or dizziness. Phenobarbital therapy may increase verapamil clearance. May increase serum levels of cyclosporine. May inhibit the clearance and increase the plasma levels oftheophylline.Clinical data and animal studies suggest that verapamil may potentiate the activity of neuromuscular blocking agents (curare-like and depolarizing). It may be necessary to decrease the dose of verapamil and/or the dose of the neuromuscular blocking agent when the drugs are used together. #References .........................

Thromboembolic disease remains a major cause of maternalmorbidity and mortality. There are no adequate reports orwell-controlled studies in pregnant women. It is most likely that a woman with a prior thromboembolic event unrelated to a permanent risk factor does not require prophylaxis during asubsequent pregnancy. The risk of a bleeding complication duringpregnancy approximates 18% with warfarin. An INR of 3.0 is sufficient for either prophylaxis or treatment of venousthromboembolism, thus minimizing the risk of hemorrhageassociated with higher INRs. Women on warfarin planning pregnancy should switch to a heparinoid agent prior to conception if possible. However, therapeutic heparin is not effective prophylaxis in women with a prosthetic heart valve, though some recommend replacement with heparin between 6 and 12w. A daily dose >5mg is associated with a greater risk of an adverse pregnancy outcome. If the mother's condition requiresanticoagulation with warfarin, it should be substituted with heparin at 36w to decrease the risk to the fetus. Neuraxial anesthesia is contraindicated because of the risk of puncture-associated bleeding. Warfarin treatment is resumed postpartum. There is consensus those women with APL syndrome and theirfirst DVT should be treated with warfarin to a target INR of 2.3-3.0. However, a recent systematic review includingobservational studies found patients with APL syndrome andstroke to be at a high risk of recurrent events. It may be reasonable to a target an INR >3.0 in this group. Likewise, the optimal approach for women with obstetric manifestations of APL syndrome is not well defined. Some recommenduniversal aspirin plus heparin, while others consider aspirin 1175in monotherapy useful for women with recurrent early miscarriage only. Anticoagulation was evaluated in 60 pregnancies with a mechanical heart valve prosthesis and 45 with a tissue valve.All women had warfarin in the 2nd trimester and heparin for delivery. The 1st trimester was divided among warfarin only, heparin and LMWH. Live births occurred in 60% of tissue valves and 30% of mechanical valves. Likewise, spontaneous abortionrates differed with 2% in the tissue valves and 37% in the mechanical valves. The worst outcomes were with warfarin in the 1st trimester. Side effects include hemorrhage, skin necrosis, rash, major hemorrhage, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, hepatitis, dermatitis, and blue toe syndrome. #Fetal Considerations ........... Warfarin is a known teratogen. While there are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses, exposurefrom 6 to 10w gestation is associated with an embryopathy, and exposure subsequently with a fetopathy. The fetal warfarin syndrome includes nasal hypoplasia deafness, and mental retardation.While the embryopathy appears secondary to a fetal vitamin Kdeficiency, the fetopathy results from microhemorrhages. The most common include of the corpus callosum, Dandy-Walker malformation, and optic atrophy.In a large series of women treated the duration of pregnancy fora prosthetic valve, the overall incidence of fetal warfarin syndrome was 5.6%. The pregnancy loss rate was 32% and thestillbirth rate 10% of pregnancies achieving at least 20w.School-age children exposed in utero have an increased frequency of mild neurologic dysfunction and an IQ <80. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Warfarin does not enter human breast milk and is compatible with breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ The following factors, alone or in combination, may beresponsible for increased PT/INR response: Endogenous Factors: Cancer, collagen CHF, diarrhea, hyperthyroidism, poor nutritionalstate, steatorrhea and vitamin K deficiency.Hepatic Disorders: Infectious hepatitis fungal medications, gastric acidity andpeptic ulcer agents, GIs (prokinetic agents and ulcerative colitis agents), gout treatment agents, hepatotoxic hyperglycemic agents, The following factors, alone or in combination, may be responsible for decreased PT/INR response: Endogenous when botanical medicines are takenconcomitantly with warfarin . The amount of active ingredients may vary due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with botanical medicinal preparations. It is good practice to monitor the patient's response with additional PT/INR determinationswhen initiating or discontinuing botanicals.Specific botanicals reported to include the dong quai (Angelica sinensis), garlic, and Ginkgo biloba are most often associated with an increase in the effects of warfarin . Coenzyme Q 10(ubidecarenone) and St. John's wort are most often associated with a decrease in the effects of warfarin. Botanicals that contain coumarins with potential clover, sweetwoodruff, wrack contain and/or have antiplatelet aspen, black cohosh, black haw, be observed when used with NSAIDs, including aspirin, to be certain no change in the warfarin dose is required. Acquired or inherited warfarin resistance should be suspected if large daily doses are required to maintain a patient's PT/INR within a normal therapeutic range. #References .........................

There is only limited published experience with zafirlukast during pregnancy. Leukotriene receptor antagonists are probably safe during pregnancy but should be limited to special circumstances, where they are viewed essential for asthma control.Side effects include Churg-Strauss syndrome, headache, rhinitis, N/V, diarrhea, pain, asthenia, abdominal pain, dizziness, myalgia, fever, back pain, increased hepatic transaminases, and dyspepsia. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. It is unknown whether zafirlukast crosses the human placenta. In one recent report, the subjects wereparticipants of the Organization of Teratology InformationSpecialists Asthma Medications in Pregnancy Study. Perinataloutcomes among 96 women who took leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) ( montelukast orzafirlukast ) were compared with women who exclusively took short-acting b-agonists (n = 122) and women without asthma (n = 346). LTRAs use was not associated with an increased risk of pregnancyloss, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, low maternal weight gain,preterm delivery, low Apgar scores, or reduced measures of birthlength and head circumference in infants. The prevalence of major structural defects in the LTRA group (5.95%) was higher compared with nonasthmatic controls (p = 0.007), but notdifferent from the comparison group with asthma (p = 0.524).Furthermore, the defects observed in the LTRA group did not represent a consistent pattern. These findings suggests LTRAs are not a major human teratogen. Rodent and primate studies arereassuring, revealing no evidence of teratogenicity or IUGR (unless there was maternal toxicity) despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. Zafirlukast is excreted into human breast milk with an M:P ratio of 0.2. #Drug Interactions ................ Increases the t/2 and AUC of warfarin.

Other drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 include carbamazepine, phenytoin, andtolbutamide. These combinations have not been studied.Use with erythromycin decreases mean plasma levels of zafirlukast by approximately 40%. 1179Use with theophylline may decrease mean plasma levels of zafirlukast by some 30%. Rare instances of patients experiencing increased theophylline levels with or without clinical signs or symptoms of theophylline toxicity after the addition of zafirlukast have been reported.

It is unknown whether zalcitabine enters human breast milk. However, breastfeeding is contraindicatedin HIV-infected nursing women where formula is available toreduce the risk of neonatal transmission. #Drug Interactions ................ In vitro studies suggest use with lamivudine may result in subtherapeutic levels of the active phosphorylated zalcitabine, which may lead to a decreased antiretroviral effect. While it is unknown whether these in vitro findings translate into clinical consequences, concomitant use of zalcitabine andlamivudine is not recommended. Use with drugs that have the potential to cause peripheral neuropathy (e.g., possible.Use with didanosine is not recommended. Discontinue when a drug that has the potential to cause pancreatitis (e.g., pentamidine). Death due to fulminant pancreatitis possibly related to IV pentamidine andzalcitabine has been reported. Amphotericin, foscarnet, and aminoglycosides may increase the risk of peripheral neuropathy (or other zalcitabine -associated adverse events) by interfering with the renal clearance ofzalcitabine. Patients who require one of these drugs should have frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring with dose adjustment for any significant change in renal function. Use with probenecid orcimetidine decreases the elimination ofzalcitabine, most likely by inhibition of its renal tubular secretion.

The treatment of HIV infection during pregnancy significantly reduces the risk of mother-child transmission. Combination therapy ( lamivudine, nevirapine, zidovudine ) remains the standard of care for management of HIV infection in adults due to its high efficacy. The Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group(protocol 076) documented that zidovudine chemoprophylaxis reduced perinatal HIV-1 transmission nearly 70%. Since then,multiple randomized studies confirm zidovudine monotherapy is extremely effective in preventing vertical transmission of thevirus. Shorter regimens reduced the risk of transmission by 50% in a non-breastfeeding population, and by about 37% in breastfeeding populations. When zidovudine is combined with other antiretroviral drugs (protease inhibitors), the effectiveness is almost 90%. The addition of nevirapine to the standard IVzidovudine labor regimen further reduces perinatal HIV transmission in women not already receiving antenatal antiretroviral therapy. The addition of nevirapine is not beneficial when the patient has been using ''triple therapy'' prenatally. It ispossible in developed countries to lower the transmission ratebelow 4% using combinations of available medications and, forthe selective patient, elective cesarean section before labor. Thus, it is important to encourage women to undergo testing for HIV during pregnancy, maximizing opportunities for offeringantiretroviral therapy. Unfortunately, adherence to zidovudine therapy may be relatively low during the last 3w of gestation andduring the first 3w postpartum. For women with HIV RNA a 3-part zidovudine prophylaxis regimen (prenatal, intrapartum, and neonatal) should be used alone or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. Zidovudine prophylaxis is not associated with the development of resistance. Women should be monitored closely for hepatotoxicity afterinitiation of zidovudine. Side effects include agranulocytosis, diaphoresis, #Fetal Considerations ........... Zidovudine and its major metabolites rapidly cross the human placenta, achieving concentrations that approach unity even in the 1st trimester. Maternal antiretroviral drug therapy during pregnancy and labor, followed by 6w of neonatal zidovudine, significantly reduces the risk of vertical transmission. Additionalantiretroviral drugs may be needed in some high-risk newborns. Asymptomatic women with HIV who lack a social support network are more likely not to comply with the recommendedneonatal prophylactic regimen of antiretroviral therapy. Electivecesarean section prior to the onset of labor also reduces the rate of vertical transmission if there is a detectable maternal viral load. Mitochondrial disorders are described in children exposed tozidovudine in utero. MRIs observed in children with antiretroviral-induced mitochondrial dysfunction are similar to those in children with congenital mitochondrial diseases and even in exposed children without symptoms of systemicmitochondrial dysfunction. Fetuses exposed to triple therapy may be at increased risk for malformations. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There is no published experience in nursing women. It is unknown whether zidovudine enters human breast milk. It is excreted into rodent milk. However, breastfeeding iscontraindicated in HIV-infected nursing women where formulais available to reduce the risk of neonatal transmission. #Drug Interactions ................ Use with either stavudine ordoxorubicin should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship has been demonstrated in vitro. Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV, and their concomitant use should be avoided. Use with ganciclovir, interferon-alfa, or other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. #References .........................

There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of zolpidem in pregnant women. Zolpidem significantly inhibits smooth muscle contractility in vitro. Side effects include ataxia, hallucinations, headache, drowsiness, lethargy, depression, dizziness, URI, sinusitis, pharyngitis, drymouth, nausea, dyspepsia, constipation, palpitations,arthralgia, back pain, and myalgias. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies inhuman fetuses. Zolpidem crosses the human placenta, but the kinetics have yet to be elucidated. Typical maternal peak levels after 5 or 10mg are 59 and 121ng/ml respectively. In one case report, the cord blood level at least 14h after maternal ingestionwas 41ng/ml. Rodent studies are reassuring, revealing no evidenceof teratogenicity or IUGR despite the use of doses higher than those used clinically. Prenatal exposure to diazepam and alprazolam, but not to zolpidem, affects behavioral stress reactivity in adult male rats. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... Less than 0.02% of the total administered maternal dose is excreted into milk, but the effect of zolpidem on the infant is unknown. It seems unlikely the occasional use of zolpidem would pose a clinically insignificant risk to the breastfeedingneonate. If desired, the patient may pump her breasts for8h and then resume breastfeeding. #Drug Interactions ................ There is an additive effect on performance whenused ethanol.Fluoxetine may increase zolpidem 15-20%. Sertraline may increase the zolpidem C max(43%) and decrease the T max(53%). Since the systematic evaluations of zolpidem in combination with other CNS-active drugs have been limited, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of any CNS-active drug to be used with zolpidem. Any drug with CNS-depressant effects could potentially enhance the CNS-depressant effects of zolpidem. by flumazenil. 1190#References .........................

There are no interactions between zonisamide and the combined OCP, progesterone-only pill, medroxyprogesterone injections, orlevonorgestrel implants. There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies of zonisamide in pregnant women. Levels may decline with advancing gestation. Side effects include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, agranulocytosis, heat stroke, withdrawal seizures, aplastic anemia, somnolence, fatigue, anorexia, dizziness,headache, irritability, agitation, impaired concentration, speech disturbance, impaired memory, mental slowing, confusion, depression, insomnia, diplopia, tremor, and incoordination. #Fetal Considerations ........... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies in human fetuses. Zonisamide crosses the human placenta, achieving F:M ratios of 0.92. The current data do not indicate an increased risk of teratogenicity in humans. However, studies in rodents, dogs, and nonhuman primates reveal embryotoxicity and an increased prevalence of malformations when zonisamide is given at doses within the human range during organogenesis. #Breastfeeding Safety .......... There are no adequate reports or well-controlled studies innursing women. Zonisamide enters human milk, achieving an M:P ratio between 0.6 and 1.03. Using the available data,the theoretic infant dose would approximate 1.4mg/kg/d. #Drug Interactions ................ Drugs that induce liver enzymes increase the metabolism andclearance of zonisamide and decrease its t/2. The t/2 of zonisamide following a 400mg dose enzyme-inducing AEDs (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, 1191phenytoin ) was compared to the non-enzyme-inducing AED, valproate, which was 46h. Concurrent medication with drugs that either induce or inhibit CYP3A4 would be expected to alter serum concentrations ofzonisamide. #References .........................

Category BEither animal-reproduction studies have not demonstrated a fetalrisk but there are no controlled studies in pregnant women, oranimal-reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect (otherthan a decrease in fertility) that was not confirmed in controlledstudies in women in the first trimester (and there is no evidenceof a risk in later trimesters). Category CEither study in animals has revealed adverse effects on the fetus(teratogenic or embryocidal or other) and there are no controlledstudies in women, or studies in women and animals are notavailable. Drugs should be given only if the potential benefitjustifies the potential risk to the fetus. Category DThere is positive evidence of human fetal risk, but the benefitsfrom use in pregnant women may be acceptable despite the risk(e.g., if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or for aserious disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or areineffective). Category XStudies in animals or human beings have demonstrated fetalabnormalities, or there is evidence of fetal risk based on humanexperience or both, and the risk of the use of the drug inpregnant women clearly outweighs any possible benefit.
