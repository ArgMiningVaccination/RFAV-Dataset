A Clemmons botanist and her son have been harvesting local herbs and transforming them into teas. But their real work, they say is teaching others the benefits of harvesting their own. Long before earning her degree from UNC-Chapel Hill, Brenda Smith Davis has a deep appreciation for the world around her. \"My mother, grandmother, we were out working in the fields. It was part of what we did and what we know,\" said Brenda Smith Davis, Holistic Resilience Wildcrafter. As a botanist, Smith Davis sees potential in what others call a problem. \"Dandelion, plantains, prunella,\" said Smith Davis. \"Three big ones that have a lot of benefits. If you look on the back of a weed killer, they're the targets of them.\" Davis and her son Sanders make loose leaf teas from holistic herbs they grow and harvest on a small farm in Clemmons. A product they say carries a host of health benefits\u2014especially during cold and flu season. \"It's the whole experience of making the tea and experiencing that connection, because it takes a little bit of time,\" said Sanders Davis, Holistic Resilience. \"You can reflect a little bit while its steeping.\" The family has been working for more than a year now, educating the public about wildcrafting and more through workshops. They say North Carolina's temperate climate allows plants typically used in Chinese herbal medicine to also grow here. \"One of the most well-known and most often used in Chinese herbal medicine that's a great immune system booster is Lobelia inflata. We actually have a similar plant of the same family,\" said Smith Davis. \"People may be familiar with Cardinal Flower. \" As always, if you're not feeling well, consult your doctor and get checked out before trying anything new.
