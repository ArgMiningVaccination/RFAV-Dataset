Firstly, because of the growing workload and secondly because of the importance of nourishing ingredients. Nightwatch is the ultimate solution. A healthy workload is great for you. It helps you feel balanced, makes you feel a part of something and gives you confidence and energy. But it also takes a lot of energy. The emphasis is increasingly on efficiency and achievements. At Nightwatch, we want you to feel naturally energized so that you can take on any task at any day. To help you with that, we have selected only the most efficient ingredients to supplement your daily diet with a dose of caffeine and other stimulating ingredients. The caffeine that our main ingredient guayusa contains, doesn't give you the highs or lows that is often associated with coffee. Because of the xanthines that guayusa contains, energy is released very slowly over a longer period of time. There are, of course, also other energy drinks that will give you some extra energy. But, not only do they come with the so-called 'coffee crash', they also contain a lot more added sugars and other chemicals. The demand for all-natural energy is growing because it has become so much clearer that it is important to know what you put into your body. When drinking Nightwatch, this is exactly the point. You will enjoy extreme but positive energy and you'll only consume all-natural ingredients only. "}
