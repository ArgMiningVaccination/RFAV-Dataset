In simple terms, eating clean is the practice of avoiding processed and refined food. \"Clean\" diets focus on eating whole foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, healthy proteins and healthy fats. Engaging in the clean-eating lifestyle helps the body receive proper nutrition, removes toxins, aids in weight loss, and increases overall well-being. Since clean eating is not a calorie-counting diet, it is fairly easy to follow. Below are six healthy tips to get started on a journey to clean eating. Eat whole foods Whole foods are foods that have been processed or refined as little as possible and free of additives or additional artificial substances. These foods have not been altered in any way. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, free-range and grass-fed meats, unsalted nuts, and seeds are good sources of whole foods. Avoid processed foods Any food that has a label, meaning the product contains more than one ingredient, is considered to be a processed food. There is no need to do away with all processed foods; for example, natural cheeses or whole grain pastas are good clean-eating choices. Eliminate refined sugar Refined sugar adds inches to the waistline and provides no health benefits. It should simply be avoided as much as possible. Eat more whole grains Exchange altered carbohydrates, such as pasta, white rice and white bread, for healthier whole carbohydrates, such as wheat bread, pasta and brown rice. Load up on fruits and vegetables While some clean eaters believe that canned frozen fruit and vegetable options should be avoided, these options have just as many healthy nutrients as the fresh options. It's important to read the label to make sure there are no added sugars or salts. Between five and nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day is recommended. Fill up on water On the most basic level, drinking a glass of water before a meal decreases the amount of food consumed. Infusing water with lemon, strawberries, cucumber, or mint adds some flavor. "}
