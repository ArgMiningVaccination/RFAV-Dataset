It is the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) obligation to protect individuals in the United States from using and consuming harmful products. Because many of the treatments of alternative medicine do not adhere to the principles of conventional medicine, whether or not to allow practice of these techniques in the United States is a major concern of the medical community today.
