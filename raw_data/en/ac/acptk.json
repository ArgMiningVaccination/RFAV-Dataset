Across the globe, from Japanese-style sentos, to Russian banya and to Nordic [hot springs](https://www.vogue.com/article/colorado-historic-hot-springs-loop), countless bathing cultures speak to the natural healing properties of water. But beyond the more obvious relaxing and muscle-soothing benefits, baths can clear the way for soulful transformations. They can help you channel your creativity and activate powerful insights, establish and strengthen boundaries, or even heal from deep, psychic pain, according to Deborah Hanekamp, better-known as [Mama Medicine](https://mamamedicine.com). During her medicine reading sessions, the popular New York-based healer typically sends clients home with an individual bath \"recipe,\" which she recommends taking within a week of the session. In her new book, \" [Ritual Baths](https://www.amazon.com/Ritual-Baths-Your-Own-Healer/dp/0062915789),\" Mama Medicine explains how we can all practice better self-care by integrating the healing powers of water with those of crystals, flowers, and herbs. Needless to say, given the ongoing health threat of COVID-19, and mandates for [social distancing](https://www.vogue.com/article/social-distancing-covid-19) and self-isolation, this book couldn't have arrived at a more prescient time. \"We are facing a time of great uncertainty, and we only know that this will change us all forever. Having tools within us that we can draw upon for healing could be a start of a new way, one in which we put our part in the collective above our personal desires,\" she says. Ritual Baths provides over 60 bath recipes, which Mama Medicine categorizes according to aura colors. There's a helpful quiz-like questionnaire for determining your own aura color, but you can also follow your intuition and choose whichever bath speaks to you, she says. If you're calling new love into your life, for example, try a soaking blend of Epsom salt, dragon fruit powder, coconut milk, rose absolute essential oil, along with a rose quartz crystal. Or there's the timely \"Strength Bath,\" a rosemary and rose-focused concoction for fortitude and endurance, whether it's to let go of attachments, become more grounded, or seek out the wisdom of our ancestors. Below, Mama Medicine provides some general rules of thumb for taking a more effective, healing bath, regardless of which recipe you follow. Lean on Go-To Pantry Items For most baths, Mama Medicine recommends a few basics, including an unscented candle and a cinnamon stick for smudging, which she favors for being a sustainable resource. \"Plants that we commonly use for smudging, like palo santo and sage, are often not sustainably sourced, though it's still possible to get beautiful varieties of these plants that are harvested with care and consideration. Cinnamon sticks are slow burning, and one stick can last you years as a smudge,\" she explains. \" When you take cinnamon internally it works as a powerful anti-inflammatory antioxidant, and it does the same when you use it as a smudge. It clears toxic energy and calms you down.\" She also suggests bath salts (epsom is an easily accessible type), a feather for wafting the smoke from your smudge stick, and fresh or dried rosemary, which she notes \"carries the energy of a mother with loving boundaries\u2014something a lot of us could benefit from.\" Consider Lunar Phases When taking your bath, consider the current phase of the moon. \"We can feel so much grounded peace by connecting with nature through our baths, and aligning ourselves with the moon,\" she says. \"The full moon is a great time for reflections and revelations in your bath, while the new moon is a great time for intentions in your bath.\" Give Yourself Time Take it slow. For many of us advised to stay in these days, now is the time to truly heed that advice. Mama Medicine recommends soaking for at least 20 minutes to maximize a bath's healing benefits. Sip and Soak With each bath, Mama Medicine provides a tea pairing to either sip as you soak, or enjoy shortly after. If you don't have the exact tea, don't worry, she says. \"Your intention is what really matters.\" Try Tub-Free Alternatives Even without a bathtub, there are ways to reap the benefits of Mama Medicine's recipes. \"A foot bath, or bringing your bath potion into the shower with you, are both lovely options,\" she says.
