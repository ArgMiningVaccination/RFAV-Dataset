University of Vermont J The University is located at Burlington, Vermont, overlooking an at\u00ad tractive tree-shaded city situated on the shores of Lake Champlain. J Burlington, the largest city in the State, with a population of 40,000, is 95 miles from Montreal, 230 miles from Boston, and 300 miles from New York City. The city has daily plane and bus service to these points. J Chartered in 1791, the University is the twentieth oldest institution of higher learning in the United States authorized to grant degrees and the second institution founded by state legislative action to offer instruction at the university level. J Although its legal title is The University of Vermont and State Agri\u00ad cultural College, the University is known to its students and alumni as UVM. This popular abbreviation is derived from the Latin Universitas Viridis Montis. 5 Within the nine divisions of the University, instruction is offered in more than fifty programs leading to twenty-five different degrees. J The University is accredited by the following associations: The New England Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education National Association of Schools of Music The American Medical Association The American Dental Association National League for Nursing The Engineers Council for Professional Development The American Chemical Society iii The Philosophy and Objectives of \\ The University of Vermont1 v W Today, more than ever before, higher education is in ' need of a basic philosophy\u2014one which will clarify its purposes and goals, and which, at the same time, will protect it from any loss of its essential characteristics. It is important to note well that a university, the home of higher education, is not a barometer of public opinion, and that it cannot conceivably bend to meet every demand of society if it is to carry out effectively its major responsibilities to scholar\u00ad ship and learning. A university must be committed to scholarship, it must be dedicated to education in the very highest branches of learning, and it must aspire to the supreme level of excellence. If, in the constantly changing environment of modern civilization, a university finds itself in the role of a service agency, ready to meet every demand that society may make upon it, then there is real danger that the vital purposes and goals of higher education may be lost. If the danger is recognized and guarded against, however, the integrity of our educational program will not be jeopardized. What, then, is the basic purpose of the University of Vermont\u2014what is its philosophy of education? Basically, the University is an institution dedicated to pure learning in the humanities, the natural sciences, and the social sciences. Our re\u00ad sponsibility is that of creating a community of scholars, both old and young; of providing an atmosphere for the discovery, exchange, and transmission of ideas; and of furnishing continuing generations with the intellectual means for leading full and purposeful lives. Institutional Goals Quite naturally there is a diversity of goals among American insti\u00ad tutions of higher education, and inevitably there are differences in the goals of public and private institutions. As a publicly supported insti\u00ad tution, the University has accepted the responsibility of providing an educational opportunity for all qualified men and women residing in the State of Vermont. I. Cited from the President's Report, 1960. iv The University continues to meet this responsibility at the same time that it is able to enhance the educational opportunity afforded Ver- monters by the admission of students coming from many large and small communities outside Vermont's borders. This tradition, not en\u00ad joyed by many state universities, not only provides a heterogeneity of background and experience for all students, but also makes possible a breadth and depth of academic offerings which the University of Ver\u00ad mont otherwise might not be able to provide for Vermonters alone. Thus our institutional goals are ... ... to provide a liberal education through individual capacity for the making of intelligent decisions. Such an education becomes meaningful with a knowledge of our historical heritage; it becomes operational through the use of all disciplines, including mathematics and science; and it becomes influential through the art of effective communication ... to extend an opportunity for the development of a cultural life by virtue of the arts and the formulation of philosophical and moral values ... to provide skill training in preparation for specific professions and careers ... to create an atmosphere conducive to research and scholarship through the development of programs which will implement both undergraduate and graduate education ... to develop graduate programs leading to the master's and doctor's degree in areas supported by faculty, laboratory, and library facilities as a means of specialization and of complementing desired research and study in selected fields ... to carry on a program of adult education through the Evening Division, off-campus activities, cooperative extension, and modern com\u00ad munication media ... to provide services to state and local government where University personnel, data, or organization are particularly adaptable to a public need which otherwise may not be filled. Institutional Means Clearly, our institutional goals cannot be achieved without a faculty of distinction aided by an administration which recognizes that its obligation is both to provide the facilities and to help create the con\u00ad ditions in which the faculty and students can pursue their educational responsibilities. One of the most important of the University's means to the desired end is the development of an undergraduate curriculum which provides a liberal education in every professional program. This is not to say that every student should matriculate in the College of Arts and Sciences. It does mean that the professional and vocational must not crowd out a liberal education simply because the subject matter of each professional field is increasing. It is impossible today to teach everything there is to know in the professions, whether in medicine, law, engineer\u00ad ing, business, or agriculture. For this reason it is important that we con\u00ad tinually review the curriculum to reevaluate, modify, and consolidate the fundamentals of professional education so that the teaching of effective communication\u2014mathematics, history, science, and the arts\u2014 retains its central importance. Facilitating this is the emphasis placed upon individual excellence, wherein the gifted student may advance more rapidly through small seminars, conferences, individual research assignments, the use of original sources, and student advisory services. Further means include a constant reviewing of admissions require\u00ad ments to insure an educational opportunity to those applicants who will receive the greatest benefit from a college education; a fostering of re\u00ad search projects which are related to the teaching program and to our established institutional goals, providing opportunity for research in the social sciences and the humanities as well as in the natural sciences; the development of a full graduate program as rapidly as resources permit; and finally, a sustained plan of university self study to provide a con\u00ad tinuing evaluation of achievement and a basis for the consideration of new techniques and methods. Basic to these means, of course, and a resource without which the insti\u00ad tution ceases to be a university, is the library. To make our philosophy of education meaningful, to make our goals realizable, and to make our other means workable, a truly fine library is indispensable. The University's philosophy of education, then, is to create a com\u00ad munity of scholars and provide facilities and an environment for full educational development. Our goals are to ensure the undergraduate a well-rounded academic background, regardless of the field of concen\u00ad tration; to offer sound graduate programs at the master's and doctor's levels; to pursue a program of continuing adult education; and to pro\u00ad vide the State and community with professional and cultural services. vi CORRESPONDENCE Admissions Requests for a catalogue, or information concerning admission policies and procedures, rooms and tuition Director of Admissions Undergraduate Colleges College of Medicine Graduate College Evening Division Summer Session Conferences and Institutes Transcripts of Records Student Personnel Scholarships and Loans Employment of Seniors and Alumni Matters of Alumni Interest Matters of General University Interest Dean of the College Dean of the College of Medicine Dean of the Graduate College Director of the Evening Division Dean of the Summer Session Director of Conferences and Institutes Registrar Dean of Students Director of Financial Aid Director of Placement Director of Alumni Affairs The President vu THE CONTENTS PERSONNEL 1 INTRODUCTION 27 STUDENT LIFE 38 THE ADMISSION OF STUDENTS 47 STUDENT EXPENSES 50 GENERAL INFORMATION 54 THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND HOME ECONOMICS 60 THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES 72 THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION 83 THE COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY SO DIVISION OF HEALTH SCIENCES S9 THE GRADUATE COLLEGE 108 CONTINUING EDUCATION 120 COURSES OF INSTRUCTION 122 THE ALUMNI COUNCIL 248 ENROLLMENT STATISTICS 251 DEGREES 254 LOAN FUNDS, SCHOLARSHIPS, AND PRIZES 270 GENERAL INDEX 285 ACADEMIC CALENDAR 286 viii University of Vermont Personnel THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES LYMAN SMITH ROWELL, M.S.

Introduction T The University of Vermont was founded in 1791, tak\u00ad ing its place among the handful of colleges founded in this country in the eighteenth century for the higher education of young colonials and Americans of the first post-revolutionary generation. The University was the fifth New England college chartered, the second established by a state to grant the bachelor's degree, and the twentieth in the nation to do so. Though it has enjoyed a long tradition which has seen it receive sub\u00ad stantial private support, University development has been closely identi\u00ad fied with that of the State since 1791, when Vermont's founding General Assembly granted a charter to the University and set aside about 29,000 acres throughout the State with the intent that rents from this land would support the new educational institution. That same Vermont General Assembly established that the by-laws of the University should give no preference to any religious sect or de\u00ad nomination or discriminate against any, making the University of Ver\u00ad mont the first in this country and possibly in history to go on public record as supporting freedom of religion upon its campus. Colleges and Curricula The University consists of the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Agriculture and Home Economics, the College of Technology, the College of Education, the Division of Health Sciences, and the Graduate College. The College of Arts and Sciences In common with the practice at most of the early universities, the original curriculum was based on languages, rhetoric, and mathematics, theology, and moral philosophy. Today, the College of Arts and Sciences, often considered the direct descendant of the original University, pro\u00ad vides a general four-year curriculum leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts, with opportunity for concentration in one or more of the fol\u00ad lowing studies: anthropology, area studies, art, botany, chemistry, eco\u00ad nomics, English, French, geology, geography, German, Greek, history, Latin, mathematics, music, philosophy, physics, political science, psy\u00ad chology, religion, sociology, Spanish, speech, and zoology. 27 28 INTRODUCTION Majors in the Department of Economics and Business Administration may specialize in options which include accounting; banking and fi\u00ad nance; industrial management; and marketing and sales promotion. These programs lead to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Economics and Business Administration. Students interested in continuing their studies beyond the bachelor's degree may, by making a proper selection of courses, meet all require\u00ad ments for admission to graduate schools, and such professional schools and colleges as those of medicine, dentistry, law, theology, optometry, journalism, and social work. Those who have completed three years of premedical study at the University may qualify for the degree of Bache\u00ad lor of Science after successfully completing one year of study in an approved college of medicine. The College of Agriculture and Home Economics In 1862, the Congress of the United States enacted legislation, fostered by Vermont Senator Justin Smith Morrill, which provided for the estab\u00ad lishment of a system of colleges\u2014one for every state\u2014which would make possible college education for all who were qualified. These insti\u00ad tutions came to be known as the Land-Grant institutions of America because the Morrill Act provided federal funds for each state which would set aside lands for the new colleges. Their aim was to make possible a new kind of education which combined and blended the agricultural and mechanic arts with education in the liberal and scientific courses. The State of Vermont moved to charter a land-grant institution, the Vermont College of Agriculture, in 1864, and this new college was joined with the University of Vermont in 1865. Under later federal legislation, the services of the land-grant colleges were expanded by the creation of agricultural research and service divisions\u2014the Agricultural Experiment Station and the Agricultural Extension Service respectively. Today the College of Agriculture and Home Economics offers four- year curricula leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Agricul\u00ad ture, Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Engineering, Bachelor of Sci\u00ad ence in Forestry, and Bachelor of Science in Home Economics. It also offers a two-year program in preveterinary science which prepares stu\u00ad dents for admission to other institutions for professional training. The curriculum in agriculture provides options in general agriculture, agricultural economics, agricultural education, agricultural engineering management, animal and dairy science, botany, dairy industry, foreign agricultural service, plant and soil science, and poultry science. The curriculum in home economics provides options in clothing, tex\u00ad tiles and related art; family living, human development, preprofessional social work; food and nutrition; teaching and extension education; and housing and home management. INTRODUCTION 29 The College of Education The University of Vermont has contributed teachers to its state, region and nation virtually since its founding. The evolution of formal professional education preparation resulted first in the department, then the School of Education in 1946, in 1951 the College of Education and Nursing, and in 1968 the College of Education. It offers four-year curricula leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in the fields of ele\u00ad mentary education, secondary education, physical education, and music education. Although techniques have varied, the primary concern of the educa\u00ad tion curricula has been to produce qualified teachers who have a strong background in academic subject matter and an adequate preparation in professional education. The College of Technology The University of Vermont was probably the first nonmilitary in\u00ad stitution in America to offer instruction in engineering and was certainly the first of the present land-grant colleges to give any instruction in this area which was incorporated later into the Morrill Act. Engineering was taught in a separate department until 1911, when a College of Engineer\u00ad ing was established. In 1946 the College of Technology was formed. Today it offers programs in civil, electrical, mechanical, and management engineering; professional chemistry; mathematics; and professional physics. The Division of Health Sciences The Division of Health Sciences was authorized by the Board of Trustees to be in effect on July 1, 1968, bringing together several exist\u00ad ing related programs. It includes the School of Allied Health Sciences, the School of Nursing, and the College of Medicine. The School of Allied Health Sciences offers programs in Dental Hy\u00ad giene and in Medical Technology. Additional programs, as in Radiologic Technology, are contemplated or planned. A School of Dental Hygiene was established in 1949 and became a department of the School of Allied Health Sciences in 1968; it offers a two-year program leading to a certificate in Dental Hygiene. The Department of Medical Technology offers a two-year basic program leading to a certificate, and a four-year curriculum leading to a degree. The School of Nursing, established in 1943 as a Department of Nurs\u00ad ing in the College of Arts and Sciences and later moved to the College of Education and Nursing, offers a four-year program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing which prepares qualified indi\u00ad viduals for the practice of professional nursing in beginning positions in various health agencies, the home, and the community and provides a foundation for graduate study in nursing. With the establishment of the 30 INTRODUCTION School of Nursing, a two-year curriculum leading to an associate degree will be offered, which will provide qualified students the opportunity to acquire competencies associated with direct care of patients in various settings where medical or nursing supervision is available. Graduates of both programs are eligible to take the examination for licensure as registered nurses. The College of Medicine is historically almost as old as the University itself. Medical lectures became part of the offerings in 1804 and degrees were granted in medicine in 1822. There were some interruptions in the operation of the medical courses in 1836, but since 1853 qualified physi\u00ad cians have been graduated annually to serve Vermont and neighboring states. Today, the College of Medicine offers a four-year graduate cur\u00ad riculum leading to the degree of Doctor of Medicine and provides facili\u00ad ties for a limited number of candidates for other graduate degrees to take courses in its departments. The Graduate College Many academic departments of the University have a long history of providing formal graduate study for well qualified candidates. The Graduate College was formally established in 1952, and since that time has served to provide graduate study opportunities in academic fields in which University resources have made sound graduate programs possible. In recent years several doctoral programs have been inaugurated and more are being planned. The Graduate College administers all studies beyond the Bachelor's degree with the exception of the program of the College of Medicine leading to the Doctor of Medicine. Scholarship aid fellowships, assistantships and special loan programs are available in increasing numbers for graduate study for the student who achieves a good academic record in his undergraduate program. Nation\u00ad ally, the demand for men and women with advanced training continues to be urgent. A separate catalogue describing graduate programs at Vermont is available from the Office of the Dean of the Graduate College. Regional Cooperation The University of Vermont is an active participant with the other state universities of New England in a program of regional cooperation aimed at increasing educational opportunities for the qualified young men and women of the six New England states. Under the program New England residents are given admissions preference and resident tuition privileges in certain specialized curricula. The University of Vermont offers several programs in which qualified residents of other New Eng\u00ad land states may be granted admissions preference and resident tuition benefits. A special brochure detailing these specialized curricula, has been prepared by the New England Board of Higher Education and is avail\u00adINTRODUCTION 31 able through the University of Vermont admissions office and from the other New England state universities. The University of Vermont offers the following programs in which the Vermont in-state tuition rate is available for students from the states named. Classics, Massachusetts, Rhode Island; graduate, Maine, Massachu\u00ad setts and Rhode Island. Dairy Manufacturing, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island. Foreign Agricultural Service, Massachusetts, Rhode Island. Medical Electronics, graduate, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island. Microbiology, graduate, Maine, Rhode Island. The Vermont Campus The campus and present buildings had their origin in 1800, when Burlington was virtually still frontier territory. The University's inaugural president and his first four students felled trees from ground which is today's College Green for timber for the first college building. From their labors and from financial contributions of the citizens of Burlington, the first college building rose. When, in the early 1820's fire destroyed this first structure, it was rebuilt, again through support of Burlington residents. General Lafayette laid the cornerstone in 1825 for that second building which still stands as today's Old Mill. A modern classroom addition, Lafayette Hall, was dedicated in 1958 with a direct descendant of General Lafayette present for the ceremonies. Following its earliest tradition, much of the University's growth in terms of buildings has been the result of generous private philanthropy. The Billings Library, now serving as a student center, was one of several structures dedicated in the late 1800's. A fine example of the work of Henry Hobson Richardson, the well-known American architect, the Library was the gift of Frederick Billings of Woodstock. The gift of Dr. and Mrs. Edward H. Williams of Philadelphia, Williams Science Hall, the first completely fire-proofed college building in this country, was built in 1896 to house the expanding departments of the several sciences. It was built and furnished at a cost of $160,000. The effect of changing times is illustrated by the fact that a major renovation of the chemistry department facilities in Williams Science Hall was completed recently at a cost of over $400,000. Converse Hall, an unusual design of Gothic architecture, was com\u00ad pleted in 1895. John H. Converse, class of 1861, purchased the land on which Converse stands, erected the building, and presented the com\u00ad pleted gift to his alma mater. He also gave two houses for faculty mem\u00ad bers on the \"south common\". 32 INTRODUCTION The University dedicated a new $3,000,000 physical education facil\u00ad ity in 1962, with alumni and private philanthropy contributing $1,000,000 of the total. The State of Vermont provided a $2,000,000 bond issue, the major share of which will be repaid by student fees. The gymnasium is named to honor Roy L. Patrick, '98; the pool to honor Frank D. Forbush, '86; and the Field House to honor Albert L. Gutterson, a 1912 graduate who won in that same year an Olympic Gold Medal in the broad jump. The baseball facilities in the Field House Cage honor two Vermont alumni who achieved prominence in Major League baseball\u2014Larry Gardner and Ray Collins, both members of the Class of 1909. A new $1,895,000 engineering building, made possible by a state appropriation, houses electrical, civil, and mechanical engineering de\u00ad partments and the department of mathematics. Opened in the spring semester of 1964, it is named to honor the late Josiah Votey, a graduate of the class of 1884, who served as dean of the then College of Engi\u00ad neering at Vermont from 1901 until his death in 1931. Morrill Hall, named to honor Vermont's Senator Justin S. Morrill, father of the Land-Grant Act, was the first university building to be provided by an appropriation from the State of Vermont. It was erected in 1907 and houses administrative offices for the College of Agriculture- and Home Economics. The twentieth century has seen the construction of several buildings of Georgian architecture. The Ira Allen Memorial Chapel, with an im\u00ad posing bell tower was completed in 1927. It was the gift of James B. Wilbur, who also made a generous gift to provide scholarships for Ver\u00ad mont residents. In 1955 a sixty-four-bell electronic carillon was installed in the tower, a gift of winter carnival funds, and dedicated to all men and women of the University who served in the armed forces. Mr. Wil\u00ad bur's bequest also contributed to the building of the Fleming Museum. Named for Robert Hull Fleming, class of 1862, the Museum was made possible by a gift from Miss Katherine Wolcott of Chicago, Mr. Fleming's niece, and by gifts from other friends of the University. Completed in 1931, it houses the University's art collection, and a fine Arena Theater. The Waterman Building, dedicated in 1941, was the gift of Charles W. Waterman, class of 1885, and Anna R. Waterman. It contains ad\u00ad ministrative offices, classrooms, laboratories, recreation facilities, and a dining hall. A well-equipped language laboratory is maintained in the Waterman Building with tape-recording facilities and listening stations as an aid to pronunciation, aural comprehension, and pattern practice in French, German, Hebrew, Russian and Spanish. Also housed in the Waterman Building are the Computation Center and Data Processing facilities. The I.B.M. 360, 1620, and 1130 model electronic computers are used for teaching and research and to some extent for University business operations. INTRODUCTION 33 In 1949, a group of modern buildings, financed by state appropriation, was erected on the East campus. These are the Hills Agricultural Science Building, named to honor Joseph L. Hills, for many years Dean of the College of Agriculture; the Bertha M. Terrill Home Economics Building, named in honor of the originator and first chairman of the department of home economics; and the Joseph E. Carrigan Hall which houses the department of animal and dairy science. A Life Science Building provid\u00ad ing teaching and research space for the departments of botany and zool\u00ad ogy and including a lecture auditorium seating 350 was completed in 1968. A new University Bookstore was completed in 1967 on the East Cam\u00ad pus as an adjunct to this instructional area. Landscaping of this area accents the central Mall with the interconnecting plazas. The Redstone campus for women was originally a large estate. The mansion and the carriage house now serve as Redstone and Robinson Halls. Mable Louise Southwick Memorial Building, another imposing Georgian structure, was completed in 1936 as a center for women's ac\u00ad tivities. A gift from the family of Miss Southwick, a University gradu\u00ad ate in the class of 1905, a bequest from Miss Shirley Farr, federal funds, and a student subscription provided the building and its furnishings. Slade Hall, built in 1929, is of Colonial-type architecture. Mrs. Wil\u00ad liam G. Slade made a gift toward this building, in memory of her daughter, Harriet Slade Crombie. In 1947, the Grace Goodhue Coolidge Hall, a residence hall for women, was built adjacent to Southwick. Grace Goodhue, class of 1902, was the wife of Calvin Coolidge, President of the United States. Coolidge Hall and the three men's residence halls, Buckham, Chitten\u00ad den and Wills Halls, were the first University residence halls to be fi\u00ad nanced by a bond issue guaranteed by the State of Vermont. Room rents are used to liquidate the bond issue. Also built on these terms are the three residence halls for women south of Coolidge. Mason, Simpson, and Hamilton Halls were completed in 1957 and named, appropriately, to honor three distinguished women. Mason Hall and Hamilton Hall honor Vermont's first two women gradu\u00ad ates, Lida Mason Hodge and Ellen Hamilton Woodruff, class of 1875, who were also the first women admitted to Phi Beta Kappa at the Uni\u00ad versity. Simpson Hall honors Dean of Women Emeritus Mary Jean Simp\u00ad son, class of 1913. A three unit residence and dining facility was named to honor James Marsh, distinguished scholar who served as president of the University from 1826-33, and who introduced the works of Cole\u00ad ridge in this country; the late Professor Frederick Tupper, a noted scholar of Chaucer; and for Warren R. Austin, a Vermont graduate of the class of 1899, who served as the U. S. Representative to the United Nations from 1946-5 3. This unit for men was completed in the fall of 1961 under the federal housing loan program. A unit for women, named to honor former Dean of Women Marian Patterson was also completed in 1961, 34 INTRODUCTION and two new units, Wright and Christie, the former containing a dining hall, were added in September, 1964. These were named to honor Jessie Elvira Wright Whitcomb, a Vermont graduate of 1887, and Jean Alice Christie Chandler Bull, a graduate of 1886. A new, three house unit, is to be constructed on the Redstone campus in 1967-1968. This will provide housing facilities for about 4JO men or women. Other buildings of interest include Grassmount, a gracious Georgian mansion which was the home of a former Governor of Vermont; Pom- eroy Building, erected in 1829 for the medical department and now used to house the department of speech. The Wasson Infirmary, believed to have been an underground railway stop for escaping Negro slaves at the time of the Civil War, was purchased for the University in 1944 by a group of faculty and alumni, and named for the first dean of women, Pearl Randall Wasson. A modern home management laboratory, named to honor the late Miss E. Blundell, a member of the University's home economics faculty, was completed on the Redstone campus in 1961. To support the teaching, research and Extension programs of the College of Agriculture and Home Economics, the University maintains animal, dairy and poultry science facilities on Spear Street in South Bur\u00ad lington, approximately a mile from the main campus; has entered into a contract with the U. S. Forest Service for establishment of a forestry research center nearby; maintains the Blasberg Horticultural Research Center off Shelburne Road in South Burlington; the Vermont Research Forest with units in Charlotte, Jericho, Williston, and Wolcott; the Proctor Maple Research Farm in Underhill; and the Weybridge Research Center and Morgan Horse Farm at Weybridge, about 3 J miles south of the University's main campus at Burlington. The Weybridge facility attracts many visitors each year who come to admire, and many to buy, the University's Morgan Horses. The College of Medicine Alumni and private philanthropy has proven the key to a modern building program of the College of Medicine. Vermont medical alumni led the nation in terms of the total amount given in the first year of a three-year fund drive which saw alumni contributions more than match a federal grant which permitted completion of a $1,200,000 first unit of a three-phase program. So impressive was this record of alumni giving that it attracted the interest and support of private philanthropy which made it possible for the University to match a second federal grant in completing in 1962 the second $1,500,000 unit of the program. Construction now underway on the $8,700,000 third unit of the medical building program marks the successful completion of the most ambitious single building fund campaign ever undertaken by the Uni\u00adINTRODUCTION 35 versity of Vermont. A $2,000,000 gift from the Given Foundation, the largest single building gift ever received by the University was included in the total raised to match grants made under the Medical Facilities Act of 1964. The entire facility is scheduled for completion in 1968. Development of the College of Medicine, together with the fine hospi\u00ad tal with which the medical college is affiliated, has meant the develop\u00ad ment in Burlington of a modern medical center which serves citizens of all three northern New England states, as well as many residing in upper New York. The University Libraries The main Library, dedicated in 1961, is named to honor the late Guy W. Bailey, thirteenth president of the University. It holds the largest book collection in Vermont, and acquires regularly the major periodicals, scholarly journals and indexing and abstracting services. The University collections also include books in medicine and health-related sciences, and a strong collection in medical periodical literature, maintained in the Medical Library of the College of Medicine. Support of the Library is derived mainly from University operating funds, with some additional income available from endowments desig\u00ad nating the Library as beneficiary. The Bailey Library is a depository for United States and Canadian government publications, and acquires newspapers, pamphlets, maps, and materials in microform. The collections include the books and manu\u00ad scripts from the library of George P. Marsh, the Howard-Hawkins Civil War collections, and the Whittingham-Stevens collection of Chiswick imprints. The James B. Wilbur collection, rich in books and manuscripts relating to Vermont, the Dorothy Canfield collection of books, correspondence and manuscripts, and the papers of Ira Allen, Henry Stevens, and War\u00ad ren Austin are significant holdings of the Special Collections Department. The Robert Hull Fleming Museum The Museum, an integral part of the University's teaching program, provides a fourfold educational service to the University and the people of Vermont through its permanent collections covering the history of art, temporary exhibitions, the Fleming Museum Association, and Chil\u00ad dren's Classes in the Creative Arts. The permanent collection is arranged to augment in so far as possible the University's teaching in varied fields. Particular galleries are devoted to ancient, medieval, and renaissance art; baroque and modern painting and sculpture; American art; primitive art; and the Orient. Two gal\u00ad leries are devoted to temporary exhibitions which supplement the perma\u00ad nent collections by representing various aspects of painting, sculpture, graphic arts, architecture, photography and related material. 36 INTRODUCTION The Fleming Museum Association, open to the public, is composed of friends of the Museum whose support makes possible certain special exhibitions, guest lectures and films. Gallery talks related to exhibitions and the permanent collections are given from time to time and guide service for schools and clubs is available. Children's classes offer instruc\u00ad tion in painting and the dance to youngsters of the community. The Museum has a conference room, a lounge with a high-fidelity sound system, and a kitchenette available for meetings and social func\u00ad tions, a collection of several thousand photographs of painting and sculpture, and study area for courses in art. The ground floor of the Museum houses an arena theater with about three hundred seats. The arrangement provides the intimate atmosphere of a small theater and has contributed much to the dramatic offerings of the college year. It also houses the annual summer Shakespeare Festival. The George Bishop Lane Artists Series The George Bishop Lane Artists Series is one of the largest collegiate artists series in the country. It was inaugurated in 195 5 by a gift of over $300,000 from the late Mrs. Lane, in honor of her husband, George Bishop Lane of the Class of 1883. The Lane Series makes it possible for the University to bring to the campus and the community a continuing program of outstanding musi\u00ad cal, theatrical, dance and other artistic productions for a moderate ad\u00ad mission fee. The Series is planned and produced by a student-faculty committee, with townspeople serving with student and faculty members on an ad\u00ad visory committee. The Lane Series has presented many of the world's finest artists and groups, including the London Philharmonia, the Vienna Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Chicago Sym\u00ad phony Orchestra, the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra with David Ois- trakh, the Royal Ballet of London, the American Ballet Theatre, Rudolf Serkin, Artur Rubinstein, Van Cliburn, Isaac Stern, Nathan Milstein, Andres Segovia, The Vienna Choir Boys, the Weavers, the Robert Shaw Chorale, the Budapest String Quartet, Dave Brubeck, Errol Garner, Benny Goodman, Victor Borge, Al Hirt, Mantovani, Harry Belafonte, Joan Baez, Maurice Chevalier, Fitzgerald, Henry Man- cini, Sir John Gielgud, Roberta Peters, the New York City Opera Com\u00ad pany, the Metropolitan National Opera Company, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, and a number of plays including Tea and Sympathy, Li'l Abner, Camelot, Man for All Seasons, Look Homeward, Angel, J. B., and Hello, Dolly! INTRODUCTION 37 In addition to three major series presented during each academic year, the Lane Series also sponsors a Chamber Arts Series in the spring semester, the Lane Summer Series, several youth concerts and special events, and two extension series\u2014one in St. Johnsbury and one in Brattleboro. Conferences and Institutes An increasing number of groups hold educational conferences, insti\u00ad tutes and seminars on the campus of the University of Vermont. Wher\u00ad ever it is possible to do so, the University is pleased to cooperate in mak\u00ad ing its facilities available for this purpose. Nominal charges are made to cover costs to the University. Further information may be obtained through the Office of Confer\u00ad ences and Institutes. 38 STUDENT LIFE Student Life The general welfare of students is the responsibility of the Office of the Dean of Students. Student Personnel Services Student Personnel Services are available to assist students in the de\u00ad velopment of individual or group goals. These services include the offices of Dean of Women, Dean of Men, Student Activities, Financial Aid, Placement, Health Service, Counseling and Testing and Foreign Student Adviser. Extensive resources applicable to group goals, purposes and organi\u00ad zational problems are offered through consultation with these offices. The student personnel staff is trained to work with individuals and groups in an effort to obtain optimum educational objectives and ex\u00ad periences. COUNSELING AND TESTING CENTER Individual counseling and testing, on a confidential basis, is available to students who have social, vocational, or personal problems. Psychiatric counseling is available through the University Health Service. PLACEMENT SERVICE TO assist graduating Seniors and Alumni in ex\u00ad ploring and selecting among various employment possibilities, the University operates an extensive Placement Program. A large number of representatives from business organizations, govern\u00ad mental agencies, and school systems come to the campus each year to interview for full-time positions.

Other students may enroll in the reading program as places become available. Students who enroll must attend regularly throughout the semester. SPEECH CLINIC Services of the speech clinic, located in Pomeroy Hall, are free to students in the University who have prob\u00ad lems of articulation, foreign dialect, stuttering, inadequate vocal control, cerebral palsy, or hearing loss. Health Services The University has complete resources for maintaining the physical well-being of members of the student body. The Health Service, with its headquarters at the Wasson Memorial Infirmary, provides medical, minor surgical, orthopedic and psychiatric care for all students. Major medical, surgical, orthopedic and psychiatric cases will be treated at one of the modern general hospitals adjacent to the campus, or if feasible, arrangements made for such care at a hospital nearer the student's home. Long-term psychiatric cases will be treated by a local psychiatrist out\u00ad side the Health Service at the student's expense. Athletic teams are ex\u00ad amined prior to activity and care of injuries in these sports is supervised by the Health Service. The Health Service is staffed by a medical director, associate physicians, and psychiatric consultants, who have regular clinic hours. An ortho\u00ad pedic consultant holds a regular clinic at the infirmary. The infirmary is staffed by an administrative director, full staff of registered nurses, a part-time laboratory technician, and physical thera\u00ad pists who are also the athletic trainers. The infirmary is never closed. One of the staff physicians is on call at all times in addition to the scheduled office hours. A student may employ a private physician at his own expense and use the infirmary facilities. Parents are notified of illness by phone or letter, depending on serious\u00ad ness of the illness or injury. 40 STUDENT LIFE Every student who pays full tuition for the normal college year of nine months is entitled to a maximum of five days of free infirmary care and such routine medical care as is needed and as the infirmary and health service can render during the academic year. Students who require infirmary care for more than five days in the college year are charged at the rate of $8.00 per day. Every student at the University is required to participate in the physical education program for two years. Normally this work is taken in the freshman and sophomore years, but may be postponed on the advice and authorization of the medical director, or the student's own physician, who must forward statements to the medical director con\u00ad cerning disability. Housing The University provides housing for all full-time undergraduate stu\u00ad dents except for commuting students and those who desire and are eligible to live off campus. Upper class students who are actives or pledges of a fraternity or a sorority may register for University residence hall housing or chapter housing. Men and women students who have com\u00ad pleted six full semesters as of June 15 of the current year and also those who reach the age of 21 years as of December 31 of the current year may register for University residence hall housing or off-campus housing. The University is not responsible for the approval of off-campus housing facilities. The Director of Housing will furnish a listing and information on housing facilities that are available in the Burlington Area. A. Residence Halls. All undergraduate men and all unmarried under\u00ad graduate women are eligible to live in University residence halls. Con\u00ad tracts for room and board are binding for the college year unless can\u00ad celled for due cause with the sanction of the Dean of Women or the Dean of Men. In August each new student will receive notification of a housing assignment and the date and hour of the opening of his or her residence hall. Rooms may not be occupied until the date specified. Each student is expected to leave the residence hall not later than twenty-four hours after his or her last examination at the close of the school year. Facilities for doing personal laundry are provided in residence areas as well as space for the storage of trunks, baggage and skis. Bed linen and towels may be furnished by the student or rented from a commercial linen service which provides weekly delivery of two sheets, a pillow case, and three towels. Students provide their own window draperies, pillows, metal wastebaskets, bureau covers, desk and reading lamps. All students living in the residence halls must hav^ hoard contracts in the appro\u00ad priately assigned dining hall, with the exception of upperclass students who are members of fraternities or sororities who may elect to take their meals in the chapter house. In order to facilitate maximum educational growth from the residence hall experience each residence hall will house a pro-rated number of STUDENT LIFE 41 residents from each of the four undergraduate classes. Each residence hall is under the guidance and direction of a Resident Adviser who is a member of the Student Personnel Staff. In addition, the Resident Adviser is assisted by a specially selected undergraduate Resident Assistant. These staff members are responsible for providing opportunities for the resi\u00ad dents to profit from the educational programs afforded by the University, intellectual, social, and cultural, and to assist the residents in their growth toward maturity and responsible self direction. Each student in the residence halls is a member of his residence hall student government organization which represents student opinion and which provides edu\u00ad cational and social programs for its constituents. B. Fraternities and Sororities. Chapters of Greek letter fraternities and sororities have long been recognized as part of the intellectual, social, and extra curricular life on the campus. These groups provide valuable experience for their members in the form of interfraternity athletic competition, interfraternity sings, dances, social work projects, house operations, meal service, and educational programs. Fraternities and sororities are under the jurisdiction of the Student Personnel Dean. Fra\u00ad ternity activities are coordinated by the Interfraternity Council and sorority activities are coordinated by a Panhellenic Council. Usually only junior and senior women are permitted to live in sorority houses. Only upperclass fraternity men may contract for meals or a room in fraternity housing. Student Activities The University officially recognizes the activities of a number of or\u00ad ganizations supplementing the social and recreational needs of students, developing their cultural and religious interests, providing them with valuable business and executive experience, and broadening their con\u00ad tacts. Because it is within this area that qualities of leadership may be developed, the University encourages participation consistent with its scholastic requirements. The students manage the affairs and finances of these organizations within the framework of the University's regulations. RELIGIOUS LIFE Although the University cannot itself attempt to guide the religious life of its students, this work is carried out by several independent agencies: the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation; the Catholic Center; the Council for a Cooperative Ministry (sponsored by the American Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches, and the United Church of Christ); and the Episcopal Church at the University of Vermont. In addition, the Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship, the Christian Science College Organization, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints are represented on campus. Students desiring in\u00ad formation on any of these groups are referred to the office of the Con\u00ad sultant on Religious Programs. 42 STUDENT LIFE THE BILLINGS CENTER The major function of this multi-purpose building, located in the former Billings Li\u00ad brary, is to provide the \"where\" for co-curricular activities in an atmos\u00ad phere consistent with the goals of the University for individual develop\u00ad ment. Billings provides facilities for lectures and other programs sponsored by the various student organizations; small group conference rooms; study and recreational lounges; and snack bar facilities in the Catamount Den. As the focal point of many student activities, most campus organiza\u00ad tion offices are located in Billings. Included are the Director of Student Activities; Student Association; Women's Student Government Ariel; and Billings Center Governing Board. UNIVERSITY LODGE Located near Madonna Mountain ski area in Jeffer\u00ad son ville, Vermont, the \"Ski Lodge,\" as it is known to many on campus, is a facility that enhances the outdoor recreational program of the University. The Lodge Advisory Board recommends policies for the operation of the Lodge which was built with the support of students, alumni, and friends of the Outing Club and the University. The University Lodge provides overnight dormitory-style accommo\u00ad dations for sixty persons. Preference is given to: 1) \"Charter Members\" who have given financial 3) \"the Uni\u00ad versity family\". UVM STUDENT ASSOCIATION All students enrolled in the undergradu\u00ad ate colleges and schools are charged a student activity fee and thus become members of the UVM Student Association. A Senate, consisting of elected officers and representatives, holds weekly meetings during the year and conducts the regular business of the association. However, the student body may be convoked by the Senate or by any group of students to hold a referendum or to conduct extraordinary business. There are many opportunities for students to participate in the work of the standing committees. STUDENT COMMITTEE ON DISCIPLINE The judicial authority of the Student Association is vested in the Student Committee on Discipline, which consists of representatives of each of the undergraduate colleges. The Committee has exclusive juris\u00ad diction in all cases concerning interpretation of the Constitution and By\u00ad laws of the Student Association and legislation enacted in pursuance thereof. The Committee hears cases referred to it by the Dean of Women, the Dean of Men or the Standing Committee on Jurisdiction. STUDENT LIFE 43 WOMEN'S STUDENT GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION Every woman who enrolls as an under\u00ad graduate student at the University becomes a member of the Women's Student Government Association. W.S.G.A. Council, elected by the women students, works to educate students to become self-directing individuals, to respect the rights of others, and to develop into respon\u00ad sible citizens of the college community. W.S.G.A.'s primary purpose is to promote the academic success and the social development of all women students, while at the same time respecting the personality and the worth of the individual. HONORARY SOCIETIES National Honorary Societies represented on the University of Vermont campus include: The Phi Beta Kappa Society established the Vermont Alpha Chapter at the University in^l 848, and initiates are chosen primarily on the basis of high scholastic standing. The local chapter was the first in Phi Beta Kappa to initiate women into membership. Mortar Board is a national honorary society for senior women. Al\u00ad though membership in Mortar Board comes as a great honor for a Uni\u00ad versity of Vermont woman in recognition of outstanding service, scholar\u00ad ship, and leadership, it is also a challenge for continued sound and honest scholarship, and for unselfish service in the best interests of the college campus. The Society of the Sigma Xi, established at the University in 1945, initiates those who have proved their ability to do research in one of the sciences and, if students, who have a high scholastic standing. Other national honorary societies include Alpha Omega Alpha, medi\u00ad cine; Alpha Zeta, agriculture; Kappa Delta Pi, education; Tau Beta Pi, engineering; Omicron Nu, home economics; Delta Sigma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha, debating; Sigma Phi Alpha, dental hygiene; National Col\u00ad legiate Players, dramatics; and Alpha Lambda Delta, freshman women's scholastic; Ethan Allen Rifles, outstanding students in the Reserve Officers Training Corps; Pershing Rifles, a military fraternity. RECOGNITION SOCIETIES The several class societies recognize contribu\u00ad tions to the University of Vermont and leadership in campus life. The Boulder Society, a local society for senior men, recognizes responsible student leadership, as does Mortar Board for senior women. Election to these societies is counted one of the highest honors that a University of Vermont man or woman can achieve. Other class recognition societies are Key & Serpent, a junior society, and Gold Key, a sophomore society. The Staff & Sandal, recognition society for junior class women, and the Sophomore Aides, for women of the sophomore class, recognize leadership and scholastic achievement. 44 STUDENT LIFE ATHLETICS AND INTRAMURAL PROGRAMS A program of intercollegiate competition for men is main\u00ad tained in baseball, basketball, cross-country, football, golf, hockey, in\u00ad door track, rifle marksmanship, skiing, soccer, swimming, tennis, track.

The University is a member of the \"Yankee Conference,\" which is composed of the land- grant colleges and universities in New England, of the National Col\u00ad legiate Athletic Association, the New England Intercollegiate Athletic Association, and the Eastern College Athletic Conference. The Depart\u00ad ment of Physical Education for Men offers an excellent program of intramural sports which provides for voluntary participation by men in all classes. Competition in nineteen different sports activities is arranged among fraternities, residence halls, independent groups, and individuals. In addition to regularly scheduled intramural contests, the facilities of Patrick Gymnasium are available at various times during the week for recreational free play in a wide variety of sports activities. Equipment for free play is provided by the University and is available on a loan basis by presentation of the student's ID card. The Women's Recreation Association, open to all women students, sponsors intramural, extramural, and intercollegiate sports events for women in a variety of team sports, individual, dual, and recreational activities. Through its program, WRA endeavors to provide opportunity for leadership and to encourage participation in and administration of recreational activities and service projects for all women students. The Outing Club sponsors mountain climbing expeditions, ski trips, and other outdoor activities for both men and women students. FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES Chapters of Greek letter fraternities and sororities have long been recog\u00ad nized as part of the intellectual, social, and extracurricular life on the campus. These groups provide valuable experience for their members in the form of interfraternity athletic competition, interfraternity sings, dances, social work projects, house operation, and meal service. Fraterni\u00ad ties and sororities are under the jurisdiction of the Student Personnel deans. Policies regarding the establishment of new chapters and the operation of present groups on the campus are subject to the authority of the University Council. Fraternity activities are coordinated by the Interfraternity Council and sorority activities are coordinated by a Pan- hellenic Council. The following are active chapters of national and local fraternities: Acacia, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Alpha Gamma Rho, Alpha Tau Omega, Delta Psi, Kappa Sigma, Lambda Iota, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Mu Delta, Phi Sigma Delta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Nu, Sigma Phi, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Tau Epsilon Phi, Theta Chi and Delta Colony of Phi STUDENT LIFE 45 Gamma Delta.

A student who changes his status from full-time to part-time (fewer than twelve hours) by an approved change of enrollment during the first three weeks of a semester may be entitled to partial refund of tuition, gymnasium, and library fees, since the charges will be adjusted to fit his new status. OTHER CHARGES AND FEES 1. Refund of payments for board is made on a pro rata basis. 2. There is no refund of room rent. 3. There is no refund of student fees (Library, Gymnasium, Student Activ\u00ad ity) , except as noted under 6. above under TUITION. Banking Facilities An arrangement with the Howard National Bank and Trust Company of Burlington enables students to open and maintain regular checking accounts through the University Bursar's Office. Applications for new accounts, deposits to individual accounts, and orders for checkbooks are accepted during office hours in the Bursar's Office. The bank's normal charge of 12 y2ft per check is made for this service. The Bursar's Office cashes small personal checks for stu\u00ad dents in good standing on presentation of a current student identification card. Financial Aid Many worthy and deserving students are unable to meet college expenses and for them the University provides, so far as its resources permit, aid in the form of scholarships, loans, and employment. The extent of need and the type of financial assistance which can be awarded is determined by the Director of Finan\u00ad cial Aid. New students should request application forms for aid from the Director of Admissions, the Director of Financial Aid, or from their principal if they are attending a Vermont high school. All applicants for financial assistance must submit a Parents' Confidential Statement to the College Scholarship Service in addition to the application for financial aid. These forms may be obtained from the local high school principal. Applications for students entering the University should be filed before Feb. 1. Only in cases of emergency will applications after that date be considered. A complete list of scholarships and loan funds will be found on page 270. A brochure presenting in more detail the types of aid available may be obtained from the Financial Aid office. General Information \u00bb Definition of \"Vermont Resident\" The following rules of residence, adopted by the Board of Trustees on October 18, 1952, are used in determining a student's eligibility to benefit from the reduced tuition rate for residents of Vermont. 1. A student who is of age when he first enrolls in the University shall be deemed to be a Vermont resident if, and only if, he had his domicile in Vermont for a period of one year next preceding his first enrollment in the University, except as otherwise provided by these rules. 2. A student who is a minor when he first enrolls in the University shall be deemed to be a resident of Vermont, if, and only if, his parents had their domicile in Vermont for one year preceding his first enrollment at the University, except as otherwise provided in these rules. 3. A student, who, at the time of his first enrollment at the University, has his domicile fixed by a special rule of law (as a student under guardianship, a married woman, etc.) shall be deemed to be a resident of the State of Vermont if, and only if, the governing rule of law made Vermont his residence for a period of at least one year preceding his first enrollment. 4. In all cases in which a nonresident student claims that he has become a resident of the State of Vermont by reason of the application of a special rule of law (resulting from the appointment of a guardian, marriage of a woman student, etc.), the circumstances claimed to have made the student a resident must have taken place at least one year prior to the next regu\u00ad lar student enrollment. In such cases, the new resident status of the student shall take effect at the time of the next regular enrollment. 5. Whenever a resident student shall lose his Vermont domicile (as in the case of a minor whose parents move from the State and excepting women who marry nonresidents), the student shall immediately be reclassified as a nonresident. 6. It shall be incumbent upon any student whose status changes from resident to nonresi\u00ad dent, to inform the dean of his college, or the Registrar, promptly, of the facts relating to his residence. 7. The burden of proof shall, in all cases, rest upon the student claiming a residence of the State of Vermont. 8. The Board of Trustees may, whenever justice requires, make exceptions to these rules. The Committee on Residence has been authorized by the Board of Trustees to consider exceptions as stated in rule 8 above. Appeals from the decision of the committee may be made to the Board of Trustees. Application for change of residence classification should be made to the Director of Admissions who is chairman of the Committee on Residence. Academic Discipline CONDUCT The general principle governing the conduct of students is set forth in the following \"ancient law\" of the University: The conduct of the students toward all men is to be regulated by those plain rules of politeness, honor, and religion which are binding on every free and virtuous community. They are to conform to every require\u00ad ment of the faculty, which may arise from their relations as instructors, counselors and guardians, and as upright men and good citizens they 54 GENERAL INFORMATION 5S shall use all lawful exertions to prevent and expose all violations of the laws of God and of the country, and whatever is at variance with the objects of the University. Toward this end, the University expects each student to maintain high stan\u00ad dards of personal conduct and social responsibility at all times both on and off campus. All students as responsible citizens, are required to observe and to share in the support of all local, State and Federal regulations. Any student who fails to uphold these standards is subject to disciplinary action by the University. The disciplinary authority of the University is vested in the President. In such cases as he considers proper, this authority may be delegated to the several deans and to appropriate judicial bodies. The continuance of each student at the University, the receipt by him of academic credits, his gradu\u00ad ation and the conferring of any degree or the granting of any certifi\u00ad cate are strictly subject to the disciplinary powers of the University. The University is free to cancel his registration at any time on any grounds, if it considers such action to be for the welfare of the institution. University students and their parents are referred to the booklet Privileges and Regulations for Students in which University rules concerning discipline and academic procedures are given in detail. Each student is responsible for knowledge of these. Use of English Correct English usage is demanded by all departments in the University. Written work of any kind which is unsatisfactory in manuscript form, gram\u00ad mar, punctuation, spelling, or effectiveness of expression may be penalized, re\u00ad gardless of contents. Students whose written work falls below the standard of correct usage may be remanded to the English department for additional instruc\u00ad tion, even though the freshman course in English has been passed. Before they may be admitted to the University, foreign students must offer evidence that they are capable of reading and writing English on the college level. Reserve Officers' Training Corps The mission of the Army ROTC is to produce qualified leaders with the training and attributes essential to their progressive development in the United States Army as reserve officers or as career officers. The objective is to prepare college students for positions of responsibility commensurate with their edu\u00ad cation. The University offers Military Science as an important contribution to national defense. The U. S. Army ROTC is a recognized part of the University's organization, and all qualified male students are encouraged to satisfy in part, their military obligation under the Universal Military Training and Service Act by participating in the program on a voluntary basis. The Military Science curriculum is designed to provide a basic education in military subjects and to develop the leadership potential of the student. In\u00ad struction is given in subjects common to all branches of the Army with em\u00ad phasis on national security policy, military technology, U. S. military history, military management, logistics, instruction, and the exercise of command. Qualified graduates are commissioned as lieutenants of armor, army security 56 GENERAL INFORMATION and intelligence, artillery, engineers, finance, infantry, medical service, signal, ordnance, quartermaster, transportation, or other branch, depending upon apti\u00ad tudes, the individual's choice, and the needs of the Army. . ROTC SCHOLARSHIPS Students motivated toward a career as an Army officer may qualify for one of the 5,500 Army ROTC scholar\u00ad ships authorized by Public Law 88-647 (ROTC Vitalization Act), which pro\u00ad vides full payment of tuition, books, laboratory fees, and similar educational expenses, plus $50.00 a month subsistence pay. Grants are made on a competi\u00ad tive basis for a two-year or a four-year period, but are contingent on enrollment in the four-year ROTC program. Student agrees to serve on active duty for four years. Applications for the four-year scholarships are made during the senior year in high school. Normally the cut-off date for submission is in January. News media keep the public informed as to the exact date. Interested students should request application forms from the U. S. Army Headquarters nearest to their home. Students living in the Eastern United States should write to: Command\u00ad ing General, First United States Army, ATTN: AHAAG-CA, Fort George G. Meade, Maryland 20755. OPTIONAL PROGRAMS TWO programs are offered: (1) A four-year program comprising 90 hours of classroom and laboratory work per academic year during the freshman and sophomore years (basic course) and 120 hours during the junior and senior years (advanced course). (2) A two- year program (advanced course) identical to the junior and senior years of the four-year program, with the following prerequisite: a student who wishes to enroll in the two-year program is required to attend a basic ROTC camp for six weeks during summer vacation at one of the five U. S. Army Basic Training Centers located regionally throughout the United States. Basic camp pay is ap\u00ad proximately $135.00, plus travel and major living expenses. The basic camp must be completed prior to entering the junior academic year. Advanced course students become members of the Army Reserve during the period of enrollment, receive $40.00 a month subsistence pay during the junior and senior years, and are required to attend an advanced ROTC camp for six weeks during summer vacation at the end of their junior year. A student normally attends a camp within the army area in which his home is located. Camp pay for advanced course students is approximately $228.00, plus travel and major living expenses. The advanced course camp may be deferred for one year for cogent reasons when approved by the department. ADVANCED PLACEMENT With the concurrence of the Military Science Depart\u00ad ment, advanced placement may be granted for equiva\u00ad lent training as substantiated by a military training certificate issued by an accredited military or secondary school. UNIFORMS Uniforms are furnished without cost to each student enrolled in the basic course. A student enrolled in the advanced course receives a uniform allowance credit of $100.00 which is ample to defray the cost of his uniform. Upon graduation he receives a uniform allowance of $300.00 which is ample to meet the initial cost of uniforms required of an Army officer on active duty. GENERAL INFORMATION 57 FLIGHT TRAINING PROGRAM The Army ROTC Flight Training Program is open to qualified seniors. It is designed to train a reserve pool of Army aviators and affords students the opportunity to qualify for a Federal Aviation Agency private pilot's license. On-campus ground and flight instruction under FAA licensed instructors is provided without cost. DISTINGUISHED MILITARY STUDENTS Members of the senior class, including ROTC scholarship students, who have demonstrated outstanding motivation toward a military career, and whose aca\u00ad demic standing is well above average, may be designated Distinguished Military Students and offered a commission in the Regular Army. POSTGRADUATE DEFERMENT Upon graduation, ROTC students are normally commissioned as officers in the U. S. Army Re\u00ad serve and agree to serve on active duty for two years, subject to call to such duty. However, active duty may be deferred for as many as four years for those who wish to pursue an advanced degree while studying as full-time graduate students. Physical Education Two years of physical education, normally completed during the freshman and sophomore years, is required of all undergraduate students. Medical examin\u00ad ations are required of all new students. Those with serious defects may be given restricted work or may be excused by the Director of Student Health. Students twenty-five years of age or older are exempt from physical education require\u00ad ments. The semester hours fisted for physical education are in addition to the total number of hours required for graduation in a specific curriculum. University Responsibility Many courses involve instruction in and the use of various types of power equipment, laboratory apparatus, and specialized facilities. The University takes every precaution to provide competent instruction and supervision of such courses. It is expected that students will cooperate by following instructions and exercising precaution. In case an accident does occur resulting in personal injury, the University can assume no responsibility except for medical care that is provided by the Student Health Service. Student Health Insurance Through an arrangement with the John C. Paige and Company, insurance, students are able to procure a health and accident insurance policy providing for payment up to $1,000.00 for each accident and $500.00 for each illness. The cost for one year's coverage is $25.00. Further details may be obtained from the Treasurer's office. Enrollment and Registration Every student is required to enroll and register at the time and in the manner designated by the Registrar. All charges for the ensuing semester must be paid, or otherwise provided for, before registration is complete. 58 GENERAL INFORMATION Changes in Enrollment Any changes in enrollment must be authorized by the dean of the college in which the student is registered. A student may add a course only during the first week of classes, but may drop a course without academic penalty during the first three weeks of classes. Change of enrollment forms are obtained from the departmental offices or advisers. Auditing Courses With the approval of the Dean and the instructor concerned, a regularly enrolled student carrying a normal program may audit a course. Others who do not wish to receive credit, or who have not met admission requirements, may also register as auditors. Auditors have no claim on the time or service of the instructor, the course is not entered on the permanent record, and no grade credit is given for the work. For students paying full tuition, no additional charge is made; for all others, tuition is charged at the applicable rate. Under no circumstances will a change be made after the enrollment period to allow credit for courses audited. The approval of the Office of Continuing Education is necessary for auditing courses in the Evening Division and Summer Session. Undergraduate Degree Requirements Degrees are conferred on the recommendation of the several colleges, and specific requirements will be found in the sections devoted to the respective col\u00ad leges. In addition to the course requirements of the several curricula, students must also fulfill the general requirements in physical education. To be eligible for graduation, a student must have attained a cumulative average of 1.70 or higher in the courses for which he has been officially enrolled. Grades in courses accepted for transfer credit are excluded in computing this average. Every candidate for a degree is required to have taken 30 of the last 42 semester hours of credit in residence at the University, except that those who have completed three years of premedical study in the University are awarded their degrees after successful completion of one year of study in any approved college of medicine. Other exceptions to this rule may be made only on recom\u00ad mendation of the Academic Council and in cases of undue hardship. To qualify for a second bachelor's degree the candidate must have fulfilled all the require\u00ad ments for the degree and must have taken a full year of work in addition to that taken to qualify for the first degree. Honors The Bachelor's degree may be conferred with honors, by vote of the Senate, in recognition of general high standing in scholarship. Three grades are dis\u00ad tinguished and indicated by inscribing on the diploma the words cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude. In the College of Medicine, the five students who have attained the highest average of marks during the entire four years' course are graduated cum laude. The names of those who receive these honors and of those who win academic awards are printed in the commence\u00ad ment program. GENERAL INFORMATION Dean's List The deans of the undergraduate colleges publish at the beginning of each semester the names of those full time students who have attained an average of at least 3.0 in their college credit courses during the preceding semester. Grades and Reports Grades are reported and recorded as letter grades. Averages are calculated from quality point equivalents. Grade Quality points Excellent A 4 Good B 3 Fair C 2 Poor D 1 Failure F 0 Other grades are:- Inc This temporary grade indicates that some work required in a course has not been completed for an acceptable reason, such as illness. It can be recorded only by permission of the student's college dean. A time limit is set by the instructor and the dean within which the work is to be completed. This shall not be later than the beginning of the corresponding semester of the next academic year. If the work is not completed within the time set, the course is regarded as failed, unless the dean rules otherwise. W The student was permitted by the dean to withdraw without penalty. The grade is omitted in averaging. WF The student withdrew with failure. The grade is weighted as an \"F\" in averaging. A quality point average of 1.70 is the minimum graduating average. All stu\u00ad dents enrolled in the undergraduate colleges receive reports of final grades from the Registrar after the close of each semester. These reports are also sent to the parent or guardian of each freshman student and to the principal of the second\u00ad ary school from which he was graduated. Reports of upperclass students are sent to parents only upon request. Special reports of low standing are sent by the deans' offices about the middle of each semester to the students concerned. Each student, former student, or graduate student may procure one photo\u00ad static transcript of his record without charge. For additional orders the charge is one dollar when one transcript is ordered. When more than one transcript is ordered at a time, the charge is one dollar for the first copy and fifty cents for each additional copy. \\ The College of Agriculture and \\ Home Economics V The College of Agriculture and Home Economics per\u00ad forms four public functions: it teaches resident students; it investigates problems; it disseminates information; it renders related services. These four areas of work are performed respectively by the resi\u00ad dent instruction division; the research division, or Vermont Agricultural Experiment Station; the extension division, or Vermont Agricultural Ex\u00ad tension Service; and the Related Services Division. The curricula of the resident instruction division are oriented to pre\u00ad pare students for professional careers. Upon receiving the bachelor's de\u00ad gree students are offered employment opportunities in management, spe\u00ad cialized services, education, and research\u2014all these in areas related to agriculture, family and consumer science, conservation, recreation, and international service. The evolution of society has necessitated continual progress and change, especially in technology, management of natural resources, and human relationships. Thus the challenge of preparing students to excel now, yet adjust to future changes, is being met through curricula de\u00ad signed to give a foundation in the social sciences and humanities plus a fundamental technical education. These curricula, which include many options, encompass agriculture, forestry, home economics, and, in addi\u00ad tion, a two-year program in preveterinary medicine. Most options in the College of Agriculture and Home Economics lead\u00ad ing to the Bachelor of Science degree require 130 semester hours of prescribed and elective courses, plus credit for required courses in physi\u00ad cal education. The Forestry Curriculum requires 138 semester hours of prescribed and elective courses, eight hours of which are earned during an eight-week summer program of instruction between the sophomore and junior years. (See page 51 for expenses.) Normally fifteen to eighteen credit hours of courses exclusive of courses in physical education constitute a semester program. In each field certain courses are prescribed, with allowance made for the election of additional courses, to provide a well-balanced and inte\u00ad grated educational program and to insure reasonable concentration. 60 THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND HOME ECONOMICS 61 Faculty advisers counsel students in the selection of elective courses and other educational problems. It is desirable that students obtain work experience in their field of specialization sometime during their college career. Such opportunities are often provided by departments in the College of Agriculture and Home Economics. A student may transfer from one curriculum, option or program in the College to another, provided the course requirements established for the curriculum, option or program are satisfied. Arrangements may be made for transfer within the College through counsel with the student's faculty adviser. The Honors Program This program of the College of Agriculture and Home Economics is designed to help the superior student. It is intended to provide an en\u00ad vironment for such students which will insure that they are constantly challenged by the most advanced work their talents will allow. Such students are selected on the basis of their academic performance usually after the completion of the sophomore year. Their curricula are developed in consultation with an honors committee and are relatively free of the customary restrictions. Special colloquia or consultations may be arranged in lieu of regular class work. Prerequisites may be waived and in general the student is encouraged to work as an individual. The Curriculum in Agriculture The degree of Bachelor of Science in Agriculture is awarded in each of the following options: Agribusiness Dairy industry Agricultural economics Foreign agricultural economics Agricultural education General agriculture Agricultural engineering management Laboratory animal technology Animal and dairy science Plant and soil science Botany Poultry science The curriculum in agriculture is broad and flexible, with sufficient areas of concentration and electives to meet the specific needs and desires of the student. Therefore, responsible departmental advising is important in the development of each student's program. Every candidate for this degree, in consultation with his adviser, must choose one of the above options upon entering the College. The candidate must then fulfill the requirements stated below, and complete a total of 130 semester hours of credit, which may include not more than 16 semester hours of military science, plus credit for required courses in physical education. 62 THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND HOME ECONOMICS Required of All Students A.

The business administration curriculum is intended to provide a sound basic training in the various phases of business activity. The several areas of concentra\u00ad tion enable students to emphasize such specialized studies as accounting, banking, industrial management, and marketing management. The Department of Eco\u00ad nomics and Business Administration cooperates with the Department of Me\u00ad chanical Engineering in offering courses in the Management Engineering Curri\u00ad culum. This curriculum is administered by the Department of Mechanical Engi\u00ad neering and is described in the section on engineering curricula. The accounting option is registered with the University of the State of New York, The State Education Department, in Albany, N. Y. Students completing the requirements of the accounting option will thus be eligible for admission to the New York State licensing examination in Certified Public Accountancy. A minimum of 126 approved semester hours is required for the Bachelor of Business Administration degree plus required courses in physical education. The normal program for the first two years is as follows: 1st 2nd 1st 2nd The Freshman Year SEMESTER The Sophomore Year SEMESTER Economic History 3 3 Sophomore Literature, 27, 28 3 3 Freshman English, Eng. 1-2 3 3 Principles of Economics, Fundamentals of Mathematics, Econ. 11, 12 3 3 Math. 7, 8 3 3 Principles of Accounting, Laboratory Science 4 4 Econ. 13-14 4 4 Foreign Language1 3-4 3-4 Foreign Language, Mathematics, or Social Science 3 3 After the first two years a student may elect various concentrations of courses to emphasize selected aspects of business administration.

Many students will desire so to direct their four-year undergraduate courses as to provide, in addition to a sound general education, appropriate preprofessional training for later work in the medical sciences, law, or theology. THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES 79 Special advising is available in the College for students preparing for careers in education, journalism, law, and medical sciences. JOURNALISM Admission to schools of journalism is generally open to academi\u00ad cally qualified students who hold the Bachelor of Arts degree with concentration in any discipline. Interested students should take a broad program in the liberal arts, including work in the social sciences, in mass com\u00ad munication, and in English. LAW American law schools, as a rule, require graduation from a four-year college with a Bachelor's degree prior to admission. There is no prescribed curriculum which is requisite for admission, but the student is advised to in\u00ad clude in his undergraduate course substantial elections in the fields of languages, literature, history, economics, political science, and philosophy. THEOLOGY Graduation from a four-year college is prerequisite for admission to most theological seminaries. Although no prescribed curriculum is demanded as preparation for such professional schools, the student is advised to elect substantially from the departments of languages (particularly classics), history, philosophy and religion, psychology, and social studies. OPTOMETRY The requirements for admission to schools of optometry vary, but typically they include courses in English, mathematics, physics, chemistry and zoology with a minimum of two years of college work. PHARMACY Under the Regional Plan (pages 30-31) Vermont residents may prepare for pharmacy school at Connecticut or Rhode Island. This is a five-year program with two years of preprofessional work which includes English, mathematics, botany, chemistry, zoology, physics, social science, a course in fine arts, and orientation to pharmacy. MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY The prevailing requirements for admission to an accredited medical college include a minimum of three years of undergraduate work, but most institutions recommend four years. It is strongly urged that a student desiring to enter medical college should dur\u00ad ing his sophomore year consult catalogues of colleges to which he expects to apply, and arrange to include in his program courses required by those schools. Each student, in consultation with his adviser, plans a four-year program of courses which will fulfill the requirements for a Bachelor's degree. To meet the minimum requirements of most medical colleges, the program should include the following: Mathematics, one of the following options: (a) Mathematics 11, 12 (recommended for able students) (b) Mathematics 11 (adequate) (c) Mathematics 9, 11 or 9, 2 (adequate) (d) Mathematics 7, 8 (acceptable but not recommended for most students) Chemistry, two years minimum, with laboratory Chemistry 1-2 or 11-12 (Chemistry 1-2 preferred) Chemistry 131, 132 (required) Chemistry 123 (required by many medical colleges, including UVM) Physics, one year minimum, with laboratory Physics 5, 6 or 17, 18, 27 (Physics 5, 6 preferred) Biology, one year minimum, with laboratory Biology 1, 2 Zoology 2 or 41 80 THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES Students who enter an accredited medical college after three years (90 hours) of undergraduate work may, on application and after completing one year of medical study, qualify as candidates for a Bachelor of Science degree. The requirements for admission to colleges of dentistry vary, but in all cases include at least two years of college work. In general, the minimum require\u00ad ments given above should be used in planning a program leading to entrance into a dental school. A student should consult catalogues of the dental colleges to which he expects to apply in order to make certain all requirements are met. Special Honors The honors program at both the junior and senior levels is designed for the superior student with unusual initiative and intellectual curiosity, and provides an opportunity to pursue a special project without the restrictions of classroom routine. Such a student enters a program of reading, research, or creation under the direction of the department of his choice. A student may take honors in either or both years. A student in the College of Arts and Sciences who, at the end of his junior year, has an average of 3.00 or above for the work of the sophomore and junior years may become an applicant for special honors in a particular subject. His program for the senior year must be approved not later than the end of the junior year by the department in which honors are sought and by the Com\u00ad mittee on Honors, and he must present a satisfactory written report and pass an oral examination on the field of special study. A program called junior honors, which may be considered introductory to but distinct from special honors, is available to juniors who have a sophomore average of 3.00 or above and who have the permission of their department chairmen. The program for each junior honors candidate will be determined by the department concerned. Departmental Honors A senior whose overall average is 2.50 or above, or who has been specially recommended by the department in which he is concentrating, is eligible to take a comprehensive examination. Upon successfully completing the examination he will be granted his degree \"with Departmental Honors.\" Some departments have instituted seminars or other programs designed to help the student gain the requisite breadth and depth of knowledge. The Center for Area Studies The Center for Area Studies is an inter-departmental activity of the Uni\u00ad versity conducted by the Committee on Area Studies appointed by the President. The purposes of the Center are to encourage and coordinate interdisciplinary study of selected foreign areas and to promote research and interest in foreign areas among all the colleges of the University. The staff and course offerings in the Center's program are included under the various academic departments. THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES 81 The Center represents a permanent continuation of the interest in non- Western areas that was developed by the Program of Non-Western Studies under a five-year grant, 1959-1964. The Center for Area Studies administers the program of concentration in Area Studies for the A.B. degree in the College of Arts and Sciences. Under\u00ad graduates concentrating in Area Studies choose one of the areas in which the Center currently approves an interdisciplinary program of social science and foreign language: Canada, Latin America, Russia and East Europe, and Asia. For the Requirements for concentration in Area Studies see under the College of Arts and Sciences. Undergraduates interested in taking area studies should, as early as possible in their college careers, consult the Chairman of the Committee on Area Studies or the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. Study Abroad The Vermont Overseas Study Program at the University of Nice in France provides a year of study abroad for a selected group of undergraduates from the University of Vermont and from other Vermont colleges and universities. In\u00ad tended primarily for students concentrating in French, the program is also open to qualified students from other fields, such as the fine arts or the social sciences. Student selection will be based on the following criteria: 1. Sophomore, junior, or senior class standing with a grade point average of 3.0 (B) or better in French and a 2.5 (B-) overall average. 2. An adequate working knowledge of French. 3. An interest in and potential for capitalizing on a year of study abroad. 4. A sound educational program. 5. Creditable personal qualifications. Upon the successful completion of his work, the student receives appropriate credit (usually thirty hours) toward his degree. For further information about the Vermont Overseas Study Program, an interested student should speak to his academic dean or to the director of the program. A student wishing to attend a foreign university on his own or under another program and receive transfer credit should consult with his academic dean and obtain approval, in advance, of his plans. In general, to gain approval a student will be expected to have completed two full years of work, to have an average of at least 2.5, to have a valid academic objective, and to have a good working knowledge of the language of the country to which he proposes to go. The Government Research Center The Government Research Center, established in 1950 as the Government Clearing House, provides research and informational services for students, state and local officials, members of civic groups, and the public. Activities include the following: developing opportunities for students to become acquainted with, 82 THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES and to gain practical experience in, the operation of government; maintaining liaison with state and local officials relative to the use of University resources in the study of problems in state and local government; operating a public affairs research center, conducting research projects, and publishing studies in state and local government; and preparing background materials for conferences on public questions. Many of the activities of the Government Research Center are sponsored in cooperation with state officials, local officials, or civic groups. The annual Listers' Schools are sponsored jointly with the Governor and the Vermont State Tax Department. Many state and local officers participate in the series of one-day Town Officers Educational Conferences, which originated in the late 1930s and which are held annually in several locations throughout Vermont. A two-day conference on citizenship, in which high school juniors, high school faculty members and administrators, and University personnel participate, has become an annual event, with the cooperation of the State Department of Education and various educational associations. A Public Affairs Library collection is maintained as a memorial to the late James P. Taylor, whose effort to expand citizen interest in effective government is well known throughout the State. The Government Research Center also sponsors the annual Taylor Town Report Contest in Vermont and cooperates with the New England Council relative to the region-wide contest. The World Affairs Center The World Affairs Center, located at 479 Main Street on the University campus, is the focus for programs and services in international education. The Center is staffed jointly by the University and the Vermont Council on World Affairs, a Vermont citizens' group concerned to further greater understanding of world affairs and responsible participation in U. S. foreign policy. A library on world affairs, national foreign policies, and international organizations is maintained at the Center for the use of University members and Vermont resi\u00ad dents. Advice and services for international students and visitors are part of the Center's program. The Center cooperates with the State of Vermont, the United States, the United Nations, and many other international, national, and local organizations in arranging speakers, programs, materials for distribution, hospitality for inter\u00ad national visitors, and consultations with groups throughout Vermont on various aspects of international education. The Center serves as a coordinating agent and occasionally sponsors educational activities such as specialized conferences, non-credit courses, contests, and programs. \\ The College of Education V y The College of Education offers four-year curricula leading to the following degrees: in elementary and secondary education, the degree of Bachelor of Science in Education; and in music education, the degree of Bachelor of Science in Music Education. The objectives of the several curricula include growth in appreciation and understanding of the cultural heritage, development of social and civic competence, improvement of personality, stimulation of intellectual curiosity, strengthening of personal integrity, and development of com\u00ad petence and enthusiasm for the profession of teaching. To attain these objectives each curriculum provides for a balance of general education courses, professional courses, and laboratory experiences. General education courses may be elected in the College of Arts and Sciences, Technology, and Agriculture and Home Economics. Profession\u00ad al courses are taken in the College of Education. Professional laboratory experiences are provided in the College of Education and in public schools under the supervision of the College of Education. Education curricula in the College of Education meet requirements for teaching certification in most of the states. Adjustments in individual programs may be made to fit special requirements for certification in specific states. If in doubt about certification requirements, students should consult with their advisers or with the dean of the college. The Department of Education, in cooperation with an All-University Coordinating Committee for Teacher Education, has the responsibility for maintenance of standards approved by the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education. Official admission to teacher edu\u00ad cation is made during the sophomore year, and all students enrolled in the College of Education or in other colleges are to make application for admission to specific curricula before the beginning of the junior year. Special tests in communication skills and other screening measures are administered during freshman and sophomore years. Official forms for application may be obtained from the office of the Dean of the College of Education. Accepted students must meet personal, academic, and professional criteria established for teacher education candidates. 83 84 THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION Fifth-Year Certificate in Education A special fifth-year program culminating in a certificate of advanced study is offered for students who wish to work beyond the bachelor's degree but who need or desire more flexibility than is possible in any of the standard programs for master's degrees. The certificate program is especially designed to meet the needs of teachers who are developing new teaching fields, for advanced students who are meeting requirements for state certification, and for experienced teachers who desire flexibility in choice of courses at both graduate and undergraduate levels. Each certificate program is individualized to fit the qualifications and the professional objectives of the candidate. Undergraduate courses may be approved for the program when such courses appropriately support the candidate's pro\u00ad fessional objectives. The program for the Fifth-Year Certificate is governed by the following regu\u00ad lations: (1) Candidates must hold a bachelor's degree. (2) Candidates must make written application on forms obtained from the Office of the Dean of the College of Education. (3) Candidates are admitted to the program by action of a faculty commit\u00ad tee. (4) A maximum of twelve credits may be applied to the program at the time of admission. (J) A maximum of nine credits may be transferred from other institutions. (6) Credits for the program may be earned in the regular academic year, the Summer Session, and the Evening Division. (7) The program for each candidate must include a minimum of thirty credits approved by a faculty adviser. (8) A minimum mark of C must be made in any course which is to be in\u00ad cluded in the program. (9) No comprehensive examination or formal thesis is required for comple\u00ad tion of the program, but the candidate will submit a culminating paper under the direction of his faculty adviser. (10) The program must be completed within seven years after the time of admission. In addition to the planned program leading to the Fifth-Year Certificate, the Department of Education will arrange for college graduates special programs leading to qualification for teaching certificates in either elementary or second\u00ad ary education. To be accepted for these special programs, candidates must have included appropriate academic courses in their degree curricula, and they must satisfy the Department of Education that they have desirable personal qualifica\u00ad tions for teaching. Requests for further information about fifth-year programs should be directed to the Dean of the College of Education. Elementary Education The elementary education program is intended to prepare teachers for any of the elementary grades. The Bachelor of Science in Education is awarded upon satisfactory completion of an approved program. THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION 85 The elementary education curriculum includes a base of required academic courses, a planned sequence of professional courses, laboratory experiences, and elective academic courses. The student must use electives during the four years to build an academic major of twenty-four to thirty-three credits. Specific in\u00ad formation about majors may be obtained from advisers, the department chair\u00ad man, or the dean's office. The foundation in general education includes required courses in the social sciences, in mathematics, in laboratory science, in English and literature, in psychology and in speech. Courses in fine arts and in languages may be elected. The professional program begins with the introduction of the student to edu\u00ad cation as a field of study during his freshman year. Each student is made aware of the social foundations and relationships of education, introduced to the ex\u00ad tensive resources available to him for learning about the field in depth, and im\u00ad pressed with the developmental need for his delving into the literature and re\u00ad search as a basis for making critical judgments concerning education. The characteristics of teaching as a profession are also stressed. In the sophomore year, the students are offered field experiences with children's groups in the community. These experiences serve the dual purpose of giving first-hand information about children and of providing opportunity for de\u00ad termining the satisfaction which association with children of different age levels brings to the student. The junior year emphasizes professional course work and special content courses for elementary teaching. Professional courses include classroom observa\u00ad tion and participation in local elementary schools. The senior year continues the professional methods courses and includes seven full weeks of student teaching in the elementary schools of Burlington, South Burlington, Winooski, and Essex Junction. In each year of the program, the curriculum provides for elective courses from other colleges. Total electives approximate forty semester hours and open to the student in elementary education attractive majors in music, art, speech, lan\u00ad guage, literature, history, and other fields of study offered by the University. 1st 2nd 1st 2nd The Freshman Year SEMESTER The Sophomore Year SEMESTER Foundations of Education 2 or 2 Sophomore Literature 3 3 Speech 11 or 31 3 or 3 U.

Sophomores begin concentration on majors and minors in chosen teaching fields and are given opportunity to participate in teaching experiences in local second\u00ad ary schools. The junior and senior years combine courses in the elected teaching fields, professional courses in education, and laboratory experience in teaching. PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENTS Candidates for the degree in secondary educa\u00ad tion are required to complete with a high standard of scholarship twenty semester hours of course work in professional education. TEACHING MAJORS AND MINORS Candidates for the degree in secondary edu\u00ad cation are required to complete approved courses in two teaching fields common to secondary schools, or in one of two broad fields combining either natural sciences or social sciences. Broad field majors include approximately fifty semester hours in related courses, single sub\u00ad ject majors include at least thirty semester hours, and minors include at least eighteen semester hours. The major-minor program must include credits in ad\u00ad vanced courses. Students should choose majors and minors which bear logical relationships and which commonly occur as teaching combinations in secondary schools. Suggested major and minor fields are English, foreign languages, mathematics, physical education, social sciences, speech, and the sciences. Advisers can assist students in making choices which are in accord with student aptitudes and in\u00ad terests and which are likely teaching combinations. Outlines of suggested course I. Courses may be taken at different times in the four-year program to accommodate fields of concentration. THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION 87 sequences for majors and minors may be obtained from advisers, from the de\u00ad partment chairman, or from the office of the dean of the college. Students are expected to maintain a high standard of scholarship in their major and minor fields. A grade of less than C may not be applied to the minimum re\u00ad quired credits in majors and minors. EXPERIENCES IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS Students in secondary education have direct experiences in public schools at two points in the four-year curriculum. During the sophomore year students observe and par\u00ad ticipate as teacher assistants in local junior and senior high schools. During the senior year students devote seven continuous weeks to full-time teaching in public secondary schools. In most cases students must arrange to live off campus during the student teaching assignment. Applications for all field experiences must be made well in advance of assign\u00ad ments, and the student must assume responsibility for meeting deadlines.

The College of Technology The College of Technology includes the Departments of Chemistry, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Mathematics. It offers a number of special\u00ad ized professional curricula in these fields, in medical technology, and in physics, leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in the field of spe\u00ad cialization. Details are given in the sections immediately following. In addition to the courses listed in the several curricula, all students must fulfill the general requirements in physical education and hygiene. Stu\u00ad dents whose curricula require them to take two years of mathematics are referred to the footnote under the offerings of the Department of Mathematics for information concerning the possible sequences of courses in freshman mathematics. The Chemistry Curriculum The Department of Chemistry offers a specialized curriculum leading to the professional degree of Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. This curriculum is de\u00ad signed to give a sound basic training in chemistry, to prepare the student for ser\u00ad vice in some branch of the chemical profession, and to qualify him adequately for advanced study in graduate school. The department is accredited by the Committee on Professional Training of the American Chemical Society, which has established minimum requirements for the training of chemists at the bachelor's level. In accepting accreditation, the department has planned a cur\u00ad riculum which permits the student to reach these minimum objectives and will qualify the graduate for certification. Those who wish a less intensive training in chemistry may take the liberal arts curriculum with a concentration in chemistry and receive the Bachelor of Arts degree. These students may also qualify for accreditation by satisfactorily com\u00ad pleting certain courses beyond the minimum required for concentration, and only those who so qualify will be recommended as chemists by the department. A student can elect to concentrate in chemistry at the end of the freshman year or even as late as the end of the sophomore year and still qualify for accredita\u00ad tion. However, the department strongly recommends that the student choose before the start of his sophomore year. In the first year, and to some degree in the second year, prescribed courses are such that a student can transfer into the curriculum from liberal arts, or vice versa. 90 THE COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY 91 1st 2nd 1st 2nd The Freshman Year SEMESTER The Sophomore Year SEMESTER General Chemistry 11-12 5 5 Organic Chemistry 131, 132 3 3 Freshman English 1-2 3 3 Organic Laboratory 134 2 Mathematics1 4-5 4-5 Physical Chemistry 141 3 Physics 17-18 3 3 Literature, Eng. 25, 26 or \u2014 \u2014 27, 28 3 3 15-16 15-16 Mathematics1 3-4 3-4 Physics 27 4 German2 or Elective 4 4 17-18 18-19 1st 2nd 1st 2nd The Junior Year SEMESTER The Senior Year SEMESTER Physical Chemistry 142 3 Advanced Inorganic Chem. 212 3 Molecular Structure 143 3 Advanced Chemistry Elective5 3 3 Phys.

The services of the Center are available as follows: The Technical Library Services are available to individual companies. A charge is made for any copies of technical material supplied to the company. The Educational Extension pro\u00ad grams are available only to a group of companies or a segment of Vermont industry. All educational programs administered by the Center are partly sup\u00ad ported by registration fees. of Health Sciences Health Sciences, authorized by the Board of Trustees to become effective on July 1, 1968, brings together several related programs in this important field. It includes the School of Allied Health Sciences, which offers programs in Dental Hy\u00ad giene and in Medical Technology; the School of Nursing, with two-year and four-year programs; and the College of Medicine. The School of Allied Health Sciences In addition to the present curricula in Dental Hygiene and in Medical Tech\u00ad nology, a new program in Radiologic Technology is being planned and will be offered in the near future. The Program in Dental Hygiene A School of Dental Hygiene was established in the fall of 1949 on authoriza\u00ad tion and a grant of money by the State Legislature, and became a department in the School of Allied Health Sciences in 1968. Its purpose is to meet the ever- increasing need for dental health service. It offers a two-year curriculum lead\u00ad ing to a Certificate in Dental Hygiene. A new four-year curriculum, leading to a baccalaureate degree, is under consideration for the future. The curriculum conforms to the requirements for accrediting of schools of dental hygiene as adopted by The Council on Dental Education of the American Dental Association on June 20, 1951. On successful completion of this curricu\u00ad lum, the student is eligible to take various examinations given by the State Board of Dental Examiners for licensing by that body. Graduates of this program will be qualified to give oral prophylactic treat\u00ad ment; to chart the mouth, and to carry dental health education into the private dental practice, public institutions, hospitals and industrial clinics. The hygienist may be called upon to perform the following subsidiary functions as the supervis\u00ad ing dentist may direct or approve: to X-ray teeth and develop X-ray films; to assist with laboratory work; to make appointments and keep office records; to give demonstrations of the proper method of using a toothbrush and massaging the gums; to lecture on oral hygiene, and to teach oral hygiene and the relation of diet to oral health. The role of the dental hygienist in the achievement of oral health is an extremely important one, and opportunities for well-rewarded ser\u00ad vice are practically unlimited. The course of study is designed to give the student a background of knowl\u00ad edge sufficient to enable her to perform intelligently the tasks of her profession. The Division The Division of 99 100 THE DIVISION OF HEALTH SCIENCES Students applying for this program should be interested in and have aptitude for scientific studies. A general scientific background is acquired by courses in chemistry, bacteriology, anatomy, and physiology. Courses specifically relating to dental problems give the student an insight into the field of dentistry and dental health. English composition and public speaking teach the individual to express herself clearly on paper and by word of mouth. The proper approach to the patient is taught by courses in psychology and sociology. Skill and self- confidence are acquired by extensive work during the second year in the dental clinic. The Department of Dental Hygiene operates a fourteen-chair clinic and offers its services for examination and charting of teeth, prophylactic treatments, and the teaching of dental health to students, employees, and faculty members of the University, in addition to the school children in surrounding areas. Enrollment is limited to women who are high school graduates and otherwise eligible to enter the freshman class of the University. Prospective applicants are invited to write the Director of Admissions for detailed information concern\u00ad ing such matters as requirements for admission and expenses. High school sub\u00ad jects which are helpful prerequisites include algebra, chemistry, physics or biology. Attributes necessary for success in this curriculum are good health, emotional stability, interest in the work, and the ability to get along well with people. Since the laboratory equipment in the School of Dental Hygiene is limited, prospective students are advised to submit their application before February 1 of their senior year in high school. Applicants in this curriculum are required to take the Dental Aptitude test. Application for the test should be made to the American Dental Hygienists' Association, 304 East 4Jth St., New York, N.Y. 10017.

The School of Nursing The faculty of the School of Nursing believes that nursing is a profession which has increasing responsibilities and contributions to make in meeting the health needs of a changing society. In accordance with this belief, the edu\u00ad cational program is designed to stimulate the optimum growth of each student as an individual, a professional person, and a contributing member of society. It is believed that this can best be realized in an environment which recognizes the individuality of each student and which provides guidance towards achieve\u00ad ment of independent thought, critical judgment, and effective behavior. The purposes of the program are to provide the opportunity for qualified in\u00ad dividuals to prepare for professional practice in beginning positions, to acquire a foundation for continued formal study in nursing, and to enhance growth toward maturity as individuals, professional persons, and citizens. The graduates of this program receive the degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing, are quali\u00ad fied for state licensure examination, and may advance without further formal education to positions which require beginning administrative skills. The program objectives are designed to encourage the student in nursing to achieve progressively higher levels in the development of knowledge, skills, and understandings necessary to meet the physical, emotional, spiritual, and social needs of people; in the development of skill in establishing effective relation\u00ad ships by the understanding of behavior and its effect on interpersonal relations; in the development of an understanding of the responsibilities inherent in the professional practice of nursing and the profession's role in meeting the health needs of a changing society; and in the development of an appreciation of the thought and achievement of man as a basis for enrichment of personal life. The curriculum, conducted in four academic years, provides an approximate balance in general and professional education-. Courses in the humanities and THE DIVISION OF HEALTH SCIENCES 103 sciences\u2014biological, physical and social\u2014serve as a foundation for the profes\u00ad sional nursing courses which are begun in the second year with concentration in the third and fourth years. Faculty guided experience in the care of patients and families is secured through the facilities of the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, the Burlington Visiting Nurse Association, Inc., the Vermont State Hospital, Waterbury, and other selected community resources. The program is approved by the Vermont Board of Nursing and is fully ac\u00ad credited by the National League for Nursing, Inc. Applicants must satisfy the general admission requirements for the University. High School courses in bi\u00ad ology, chemistry, and physics are highly recommended.

Students must complete satisfactorily all requirements for admission to the College of Medicine by July 1 preceding the September admission. Ordinarily courses taken in other than a liberal arts college will not meet our admission requirements. Eligibility of an applicant for admission to the College of Medicine is determined by the Admissions Committee of the College of Medicine on the basis of the following: 1. The scholastic record of the applicant in his premedical work. 2. Personality and general fitness of the applicant for the study and practice of medicine as determined by recommendations of the applicant's college teachers and others, and by personal interview with the Admissions Committee. 3. The applicant's scores on the Medical College Admission Test. Such scores are taken into consideration but are not used as the final determinant in accepting students. If a majority (all but one or two) of the required courses have been or will be com\u00ad pleted by the end of the third year in college, applicants are urged to take the Medical College Admission Test in May of that year. 4. All applicants are required to submit a health report completed by their college or university health service and not by their per\u00ad sonal physician. A maximum of seventy-five students is admitted to the entering class. Preference for admission is according to the following priorities: 1. Qualified residents of Vermont. 2. Qualified residents of other New England states having contractual arrangements with the College of Medicine through the New Eng\u00ad land Board of Higher Education. Contracts are presently in force 106 THE DIVISION OF HEALTH SCIENCES with the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. 3. Qualified residents of other areas. Sons and daughters of the alumni of the College of Medicine of the University of Vermont are given special consideration within the frame\u00ad work of the above policy. Applications for admission to the class entering in September of any year will close January 1 preceding the September admission. Applica\u00ad tion blanks should be in by October 15 for early consideration. An application fee of ten dollars, payable to The University of Ver\u00ad mont, must accompany all applications and is not refundable. When an applicant who is not a Vermont resident is offered admission to the College of Medicine and wishes to accept the place offered, a de\u00ad posit of $100 must be paid not later than two weeks following notice of acceptance in order to reserve a place in the entering class. This deposit is refundable up to January 15, should the student release his place in the class. The deposit is applied toward the student's tuition in the first semester upon matriculation in the College of Medicine. Checks should be made payable to the University of Vermont and should be sent to the Admissions Office, College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burling\u00ad ton, Vermont 05401. THE CURRICULUM The curriculum consists of three parts: the basic science core, the clinical core, and the major program. Basic Science Cote The basic science core program includes the entire freshman year and the fall of the sophomore year. During this period students will be instructed in the medical sciences which form the basis for medical practice. The objective of the basic science core is to present that body of knowledge common to all types of medical practice and to avoid minute details which are relevant only to indi\u00ad vidual medical specialties. From the very outset students will be exposed to patients in the comprehensive clinics, the aim of which is to present the broader perspectives of medical practice. Clinical Science Core The clinical core will extend from January of the sophomore year until De\u00ad cember of the junior year. During this twelve-month period each student will receive twelve weeks of instruction in medicine, twelve weeks of instruction in surgery, eight weeks in pediatrics, eight weeks in obstetrics and gynecology, and eight weeks in psychiatry. There will be a brief summer vacation. During this year students will work within the hospitals and clinics and instruction will be based on the care of patients. THE DIVISION OF HEALTH SCIENCES 107 Major Program The major program will extend from January of the junior year of medical school until graduation in May of the following year. During this period each student will pursue a course of study which is tailored to his individual interests and objectives. For example, students interested in family practice will pursue one course of study while students interested in surgery or a surgical specialty will pursue another. The senior major program will commence with a return to the basic sciences which are related to the student's area of interest. This re\u00ad turn will constitute both a review and an extension of the material covered in the basic science core. Following this basic science study, students will take blocks of clinical work related to their interests. The basic science work will consist of approximately one-quarter and the clinical work approximately three- quarters of the major program. The major program is not designed to supplant or duplicate any portion of residency training but is designed rather to prepare students more adequately for subsequent training for family practice, a medical specialty, or teaching and research. In this last regard the faculty is considering the option of allowing students to spend the entire period of time in a basic science department. The final details for the major program are currently under active development. Further details are given in the Medical College bulletin. Teaching Facilities All departments of the College of Medicine are housed in a new building which was completed in 1968. Clinical facilities for teaching are in the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, an institution with approximately 750 beds. STATE SCHOLARSHIPS The scholarships available to students in the College of Medicine are listed on pages 274 and 275, and information on loan programs may be obtained from the Director of Financial Aid. Vermont residents in real need of financial assistance may receive up to $800 in state scholarships and loans. Loan funds are also available. Contact the Assistant Dean's Office of the College of Medicine for further information. The Graduate College The purpose of the Graduate College is to serve the needs of college graduates who desire a broader and more thorough knowledge of scholarship and research in their chosen fields. At present the College offers sixty different programs leading to the master's degree and ten programs leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Each student is expected to be familiar with the general regulations and procedures of the Graduate College, and with the specific degree requirements in his chosen field of study. For more detailed in\u00ad formation refer to the Graduate College Bulletin available from the Graduate College Office. Attention is also drawn to the special fifth-year program offered by the College of Education leading to a certificate of advanced study in Education. Master of Education Programs are designed to prepare qualified candidates for school positions in guidance, supervision, administration and reading, or to give classroom teachers a more complete understanding of professional education as applied to teaching and to membership in the profession. Programs are planned on an individual basis and may include courses in areas outside professional education. Master of Arts in Teaching This degree is appropriate for teachers who are interested primarily in increas\u00ad ing their knowledge of their subject matter field and thereby the effectiveness of their classroom instruction. Programs are offered in the following fields: Agriculture Botany Chemistry English French Geology German Greek History Home Economics Master of Extension Education Latin Mathematics Music Physics Spanish Zoology This degree is designed to meet the needs of county agricultural agents, home demonstration agents, 4-H Club agents, extension specialists, professional co\u00ad operative and agricultural business leaders. 108 THE GRADUATE COLLEGE 109 Master of Science Programs are offered in the following fields: Agricultural Biochemistry Agricultural Economics Anatomy Animal and Dairy Science Animal Pathology Biochemistry Biomedical Engineering Botany Chemistry Civil Engineering Electrical Biophysics Electrical Engineering Forestry Geology Home Economics Mechanical Engineering Medical Microbiology Medical Technology Master of Arts Programs are offered in the following fields: Economics English French German Music Philosophy Political Science Psychology Spanish Microbiology Pathology Pharmacology Physics Physiology and Biophysics Plant and Soil Science Poultry Science Speech Pathology Zoology Greek History Latin Mathematics Master of Business Administration Study leading to the degree of Master of Business Administration is designed to provide opportunity for the individual to develop knowledge and under\u00ad standing in a wide range of business activities that will provide foundation for growth and success in a business career. Programs are planned on an individual basis. Doctor of Philosophy Doctoral programs are offered for qualified students in the fields of: Biochemistry Microbiology Psychology Botany Pharmacology Zoology Chemistry Physics Electrical Engineering Physiology and Biophysics Admission To be eligible for admission a student should hold a baccalaureate degree, prior to the date of first enrollment, or have completed work equivalent to that required for a baccalaureate. His undergraduate records should indicate that he is capable of successful study at the graduate level. Graduates of unaccredited institutions must support their applications with satisfactory aptitude and ad\u00ad vanced scores on the Graduate Record Examinations. Foreign students, see special instructions on page 110. Admission is limited to students who intend to become candidates for ad\u00ad vanced degrees, other than Doctor of Medicine, and students whose enrollment will consist of courses to be taken for graduate credit. Students who hold bache\u00ad lors' degrees but whose entire enrollment will be in undergraduate courses should seek admission as non-matriculated students in the appropriate undergraduate college. Only applicants who desire to work along lines in which the University offers graduate programs will be admitted to the Graduate College. Students in the 110 THE GRADUATE COLLEGE Graduate College therefore fall into three categories: (1) duly admitted students accepted to candidacy, (2) degree candidates at other institutions who study at The University of Vermont for transfer of credit (3) duly admitted students not yet accepted to candidacy. Students seeking admission to the Graduate College must make application on an official form which can be obtained from the Office of the Graduate Col\u00ad lege. All applications must be supported by official transcripts from each college or university attended and by three letters of recommendation from persons qualified to assess the applicant's capacity for graduate work.

DISMISSAL A graduate student whose work or deportment is deemed unsatisfactory at any time may be requested by the Dean or the department concerned to with\u00ad draw from the Graduate College. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS Each student is expected to be familiar with the general requirements and procedures of the Graduate College and with the specific degree requirements in his chosen field of study. ACCEPTANCE TO CANDIDACY Applicants for the master's degree may be ac\u00ad cepted to candidacy concurrent with admission, or candidacy may be deferred pending a period of satisfactory graduate study at the University of Vermont. Acceptance to candidacy for the master's degree is granted only to those students who have fully met all undergraduate pre\u00ad requisites for the courses that are required in his graduate degree program. The approval of the department and the Dean is required. Candidacy for the doctoral degree requires a full year of graduate study in residence at The University of Vermont. A doctoral student is accepted to candidacy upon the approval of the student's Studies Committee, the depart\u00ad ment or departments concerned, and the Dean. MINIMUM RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS Each candidate for the master's degree must satisfactorily complete at least twenty-two hours of graduate credit while in residence on The University of Vermont campus, either in the regular academic year or in summer sessions, or at the off-campus centers established at Lyndon and Castleton. Each candidate for the doctoral degree must satisfactorily complete a minimum of fifty hours in residence at The University of Vermont. Each doctoral candidate must spend one full year on The University of Vermont Campus and be available for and 112 THE GRADUATE COLLEGE participate in departmental functions such as seminars and research within the department. TEACHING REQUIREMENT Each degree candidate must acquire appropriate teaching experience in his chosen field prior to the award of his degree. The nature and the amount of this teaching, for which no academic credit is allowed by the Graduate College, will be determined by the department concerned. GRADUATE CREDIT Courses numbered 400 or above are limited to candidates for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy; courses numbered 300 to 399 are limited to graduate students; courses numbered 200 to 299 are graduate courses open to advanced undergraduates. Courses numbered 100 to 199 may not be taken for graduate credit except upon recommendation of a student's Studies Committee and with the authorization of the Dean. Under no circumstances will graduate credit be allowed for a course numbered below 100. GRADE REQUIREMENTS Courses taken for graduate credit are given the letter grades of A (excellent), B (good), C (fair), and F (failure). Graduate credit is given for letter grades A, B, and C. This grading system differs somewhat from that for undergraduate level courses in that there is no letter grade of D. A candidate for a graduate degree must complete his program with a mini\u00ad mum overall quality point average of 3.0 (B). Designations of S, satisfactory and U, unsatisfactory are used to indicate levels of performance for credits received in Thesis Research and may be used to indicate levels of performance in Seminar. MAXIMUM TIME LIMITS A program leading to the master's degree must be completed within a span of three years if it is pursued on a full-time basis during the regular academic year; if the program is pursued on a part-time basis or in summer sessions, it must be completed within a span of seven years. A doctoral program must be completed within a span of nine years. This time limit applies both to study at The University of Vermont and to courses presented for transfer of credit. Individual departments may set dead\u00ad lines within these time limits. TRANSFER OF CREDIT A maximum of eight hours credit in the case of master's candidates and twenty-five hours in the case of doctoral candidates may be accepted in transfer for appropriate courses completed in residence in other institutions. Such courses must have been taken in a fully accredited college or university which offers graduate study and must be accept\u00ad able at that institution in partial fulfillment of its requirements for an advanced degree. Credit cannot be transferred for (1) courses which would not, if taken at The University of Vermont, receive graduate credit, (2) courses in which a grade lower than B\u2014(80) was received, (3) extension courses, (4) correspond\u00ad ence courses, (3) courses which are inappropriate for inclusion in any degree program offered by the Graduate College, (6) courses which were taken more than seven years prior to the completion of a degree program, (7) thesis credits received at another university. No transfer of credit is possible prior to a stu\u00ad dent's acceptance to candidacy. THE GRADUATE COLLEGE 113 EXTENSION COURSES Not more than eight semester hours of credit toward the master's degree may be earned by taking extension courses offered by The University of Vermont. A maximum of three hours of graduate credit per semester is permissible for master's candidates who are full- time teachers in public schools. No credit for extension courses is allowable in a doctoral program. Requirements for Master's Degree All master's programs require a minimum of thirty semester hours of gradu\u00ad ate credit. In programs that require a thesis, the number of credit hours to be earned in thesis research may vary between six (minimum) and fifteen (maxi\u00ad mum) ; these credits are included in the minimum of thirty required for the degree. Master of Education Before acceptance to candidacy for the degree of Master of Education, the student must present a satisfactory score in the Miller Analogies Test, and must demonstrate satisfactory proficiency in written composition. Before the degree is awarded, the candidate must have completed one year of successful teaching experience or other educational service. The graduate program of each student admitted to candidacy for the degree of Master of Education is planned and supervised by an individual committee, which includes ex-officio the Deans of the Graduate College and the College of Education. Program planning takes into consideration the student's under\u00ad graduate curriculum, his professional experience, and his aims and purposes in pursuing the master's degree. Each program must include either thirty semester hours of approved course work or twenty-four hours earned in courses and six hours in thesis research. If a student's preparation is inadequate for him to be\u00ad gin study at the graduate level in certain aspects of his program, additional undergraduate courses will be required. In order to insure effective planning of a graduate program for the degree of Master of Education, not more than twelve hours credit (fourteen if the maxi\u00ad mum eight hours of transfer credit is offered) will be accepted in partial ful\u00ad fillment of degree requirements for courses taken prior to acceptance to candi\u00ad dacy. A prospective candidate should therefore make application for acceptance to candidacy before his first semester of residence, or, if he has been a student in Summer Session, prior to his second summer in residence. Candidates must expect to earn on The University of Vermont campus a part of the credit to be applied to a graduate degree. In most cases candidates who are in residence during the regular academic year must also attend one or two summer sessions in order to have a suitable selection of available courses. Master of Arts in Teaching The program leading to the degree of Master of Arts in Teaching is designed primarily for teachers with the purpose of enhancing their teaching ability and strengthening their background in their subject matter field. A minimum of thirty semester hours is required in courses numbered above 200, of which not less than six semester hours shall be in Education. No thesis 114 THE GRADUATE COLLEGE is allowable in this degree program; a student must complete at least twenty hours, and usually twenty-four, in a single department offering courses for graduate credit or in any acceptable combination of such departments. In order to be accepted to candidacy for this degree, a student must have completed an undergraduate major within the area of his specialization, have submitted a satisfactory score on the Miller Analogies Test, and be acceptable to the de\u00ad partment or departments concerned. In his undergraduate program, a candidate is expected to have completed the necessary courses in education to meet minimum requirements for a teaching certificate. If candidates have not qualified for teaching certification, they can\u00ad not expect to complete the degree in one academic year. To qualify for the degree of Master of Arts in Teaching, the candidate must present at least eighteen semester hours in education in his combined undergraduate and gradu\u00ad ate program. This requirement is specified to ensure that the degree recipient can meet minimum state certification requirements. Master of Extension Education A minimum of thirty hours is required in courses numbered above 200. Nine semester hours are required as follows: Political Science 241, Philosophy 214, Economics 204 (courses equivalent to Political Science 241 and Economics 204 may be substituted); a minimum of twelve semester hours of course credit in Agriculture and/or Home Economics or related basic courses; and a minimum of six semester hours of course credit in Agricultural Education, Extension Edu\u00ad cation, and/or Home Economics Education. The candidate must have completed one year of successful professional ex\u00ad perience before the degree is granted. The candidate is at liberty to select the manner in which he or she will com\u00ad plete the requirements for the degree from the alternatives of: (1) a combina\u00ad tion of three-week and six-week summer sessions, (2) a combination of summer session and extension course offerings in the State, (3) full-time residence on the campus, and (4) a combination of one term of residence and summer sessions. Master of Arts and Master of Science FIELD OF SPECIALIZATION At least twenty hours of graduate credit, including credit for the thesis and research leading to the thesis, must be earned in the field of specialization. All course credits included in these twenty hours must have been earned in courses which are numbered above 200. RELATED STUDY A graduate program may include advanced courses outside the field of specialization. In order to be included as part of the master's program, these courses must be approved in advance by the depart\u00ad ment in which the student is specializing. STUDIES COMMITTEE A Studies Committee will be appointed by the Depart\u00ad ment Chairman for each candidate for the master's de\u00ad gree. It shall be the responsibility of this committee to supervise the student's program and review his progress at regular intervals. THE GRADUATE COLLEGE 115 RESEARCH AND THESIS Each candidate will undertake a problem of original research under the direction of a member of the de\u00ad partment in which he is specializing. At the conclusion of the investigation the student must present a thesis which embodies the results of his work and which demonstrates his capability for independent research. For information regarding submission of the thesis, refer to the Graduate College Bulletin. Master of Business Administration A minimum of thirty semester hours is required in courses numbered above 200. Specific course requirements include economics 207, 228, 252, and 289, a total of twelve hours. An additional twelve hours (4 courses) of approved electives plus six hours of thesis credit comprise the minimum of thirty credits. The twelve hours of elective credit provides the candidate with the oppor\u00ad tunity of concentrating his study in an appropriate field. Each candidate will pursue a thesis research topic consistent with his area of concentration and overall educational objective. At the conclusion of the research the student must present a thesis which embodies the results of his work and demonstrates his capability. Information on the M.B.A. evening program may be found in the Evening Division Catalogue. After April 1, 1968, not more than six credit hours of graduate work com\u00ad pleted prior to the date of becoming a candidate for the M.B.A. will be applied toward the degree requirements.

Continuing Education T The University through its extension services aims to broaden the horizon of those who have not attended college, to afford an opportunity for those who have attended college and subsequently wish to keep in touch with academic thought in their favorite fields or to gain information about subjects which were not studied in college, and to provide undergraduates opportunities in addi\u00ad tion to the regular classroom experience. The Summer Session Summer Session offers courses on both the graduate and undergraduate level in many subjects, including agriculture, art, astronomy, botany, chemistry, classics, dramatic art, economics, education, English, French, geography, Ger\u00ad man, history, home economics, journalism, library science, mathematics, music (instrumental and vocal), philosophy, physical education, physics, political sci\u00ad ence, psychology, reading, sociology, Spanish, speech and zoology. The offerings are diversified to meet the needs of the following various groups of students: those with adequate preparation who desire courses leading to a bachelor's degree; those with adequate preparation who wish to do graduate work for the master's degree; principals and superintendents of schools who de\u00ad sire fundamental or specialized courses in the fields of educational administration and supervision; teachers in elementary or secondary schools who seek credit toward state teachers' certificates or who desire to broaden their knowledge of special subjects; persons who desire college level courses for self-improvement. Students must have sufficient maturity and background to profit from the courses in which they enroll. It is recommended that any regularly matriculated student at The University of Vermont obtain prior approval from his academic dean for any courses to be taken in the Summer Session. The purpose of this recommendation is to insure such courses are appropriate for the degree for which the student is working. The Master's degree in several, but not all, areas may be earned through work in the Summer Session. All students desiring graduate credit for courses taken in the Summer Session must secure the approval of the Dean of the Graduate College at the time of registration. Enrollment in courses for graduate credit does not imply admission to the Graduate College. Fuller details on available courses and programs will be sent on request by the Director of the Summer Session. Evening Division Continuing education for adults in the State of Vermont is provided under the Evening Division Program offered by the University. Members of the faculty 120 CONTINUING EDUCATION 121 at the University and others, working under temporary appointment, offer evening or extension courses in arts and sciences and education. A variety of courses is presented in evening sessions on campus throughout the college year. Some of these may be taken for credit while others are non-credit and are de\u00ad signed for the adult who is interested in continuing his education for the pleasure of self-improvement. Courses are given in towns and cities throughout the state wherever a group of ten or more individuals register for a course. Arrangements for Evening Division courses are made through the Evening Division, Waterman Building. Length of courses varies from ten to fifteen weeks. It is recommended that any regularly matriculated student at the University of Vermont obtain prior approval from his academic dean for any courses to be taken in the Evening Division. The purpose of this recommendation is to in\u00ad sure such courses are appropriate for the degree for which the student is working. All persons desiring graduate credit must secure the approval of the Dean of the Graduate College at the time of registration. Conferences and Institutes Conference activity is a rapidly increasing part of University life. Both throughout the regular college year and during the summer, many conference groups make use not only of university classroom and auditorium facilities but also of university dormitories and dining service. Groups interested in arranging for meetings or conferences at the University should contact the Conferences and Institutes Office, Waterman Building. This office also arranges the Uni\u00ad versity Lecture Series which brings outstanding speakers to the campus, and coordinates the Speakers Bureau through which University personnel are made available to organizations outside the campus.
