The pancreatic cancer vaccine is a form of [immunotherapy](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/adult/allergy_and_asthma/immunotherapy_what_is_it_134,117/). The vaccine uses pancreatic cancer cells that have been treated with radiation to inhibit their ability to grow. These cells have also been genetically altered to secrete a molecule called GM-CSF. This molecule acts as a lure to attract immune system cells to the site of the tumor vaccine where they encounter proteins called antigens on the surface of the radiated cells. Then, these newly armed immune cells patrol the rest of the patient's body to destroy any circulating pancreas cancer cells still remaining. Since pancreatic cancer is often found in areas outside of the pancreas, the vaccine could allow physicians to target microscopic cancer cells that could escape other therapies. This vaccine is being tested in [clinical trials](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/kimmel_cancer_center/cancers_we_treat/pancreatic_cancer/clinical_trials.html). Pancreatic Cancer Vaccine: What to Know A new pancreatic cancer vaccine being tested in clinical trials aims to restore the power of a patient's immune system. A Johns Hopkins expert explains. "}
