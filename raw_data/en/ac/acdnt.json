We provide access to shared instrumentation and software for state-of-the-art light microscopy. We aim to assist you along the path from sample to knowledge with our know-how in image acquisition optimisation and our expertise in image processing and data mining. What we do - Maintain and upgrade a comprehensive set of high quality optical imaging systems - Advise users on experimental design and measurement strategies - Provide training and guidance in the use of those instruments - Maintain and upgrade high-end image analysis software and powerful image analysis workstations - Operate servers to store and handle imaging data - Provide all relevant information and a reservation calendar on our website - Disseminate knowledge on optical imaging through formal teaching, workshops and hands-on training - Favour the dissemination of open-source solutions for image acquisition and analysis - Ensure technological watch and promote the adoption of techniques that best meet user's needs Who can access the core facility? All research groups from the University of Fribourg and associated Institutes can get access to the facility infrastructure following standard procedure (see usage policy). Our services are also available to external persons. Interested parties should directly get in touch via email. How to use the core facility? We recommend first time facility users and scientists who are unsure which instrument to choose to directly contact us via email. Together we can determine the best instrument for the task based on sample origin and type, sample preparation, environmental requirements, fluorescent tags, and based on the structures of interest that need to be measured and analysed. The access procedure starts by downloading and studying the usage policy. In there you will find all the neccessairy detailed instructions on how to use the core facility infrastructure. "}
