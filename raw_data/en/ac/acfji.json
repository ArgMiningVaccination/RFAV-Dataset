RachelPosted 7 months ago on BookRetreatsAn amazing Ayurvedic detox yoga retreat! I wanted to go to a retreat because of my depression and weight gain. I chose this retreat because of the extensive program and the excellent reviews. The program was tailor-made to my specific needs. There is continual support from the team of doctors which have excellent medical advice. Yoga is designed specifically to aid the 7 chakras and encourage body detoxification.
