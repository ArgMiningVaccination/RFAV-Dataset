Instead of attending the annual meeting of the Canadian Medical Associa-tion in the beautiful mountainous setting of Banff, Alberta, he took his 11 year old cousin, BillyFrancis, and headed off to the leper colony at Tracadie in remote New Brunswick. He alsoarranged to rendezvous along the way with the recently widowed Grace Revere Gross. Grace anda friend, Sarah Woolley, ac- companied Osler to Tracadie. Billy decided to wait with friends30 miles away in Caraquet. It was the year before Osler began writing his famoustextbook, The Principles and Practice of Medicine , in which, he refers to his trip to Tracadie. According tothe time-honoured story, when Osler received the first copy of Principles in 1892, he tossed the book into Grace's lap and exclaimed, \"There, take the darn thing; now what are you goingto do with the man?\" They married three months later. Osler had previously proposed toGrace sometime between their visit to Tracadie and the book- tossing incident, but she hadadvised him to complete his writing first. It is easy to understand why Osler, the consummate physicianand writer, planning to create thedefinitive medical textbook, would visit one of the twoleprosaria in Canada. But why, of all places, would he take an 11 year-old boy, and the woman hewould marry three years later? Miss Sarah Woolley, William Osler, W .W . Francis and Grace Revere Osler, taken the answer to that question, I serendipitously discovered a previously un-published letter from Osler to Dr. Alfred Corbett Smith, an attending physician to thelazaretto. This led to the discovery of four additional unpublished letters, directlyassociated with or resulting from Osler's visit, including two more written by Osler himself. Theseletters significantly influenced the management of leprosy patients in Canada, the career ofDr. Smith, and the construction of new living and hospital facilities for the leprosy patientsand their care givers. This paper will discuss only briefly the history of leprosy in NewBrunswick and the lazaretto in Tracadie, since these subjects have been described in otherpublications, most notably by Losier and Pinet in C hildren of Lazarus: The Story of the Lazaretto at T racadie . (1) Leprosy first appeared in New Brunswick around 1815. Theprimary source of infection in the province is unknown. Until late in the 19 th century, the medical community was undecided if the disease was contagious, he- reditary, or both. When Oslervisited Tracadie in 1889, he supported the theory that leprosy was infectious, possibly withsome hereditary predisposition. (2) After an unsuccessful attempt to create a lazaretto on SheldrakeIsland, and with unremitting lobbying by the clergy and by family and friends of the lepers,a lazaretto was constructed at Tracadie in 1849, where the patients would be close to home.However, the buildings were small and poorly ventilated. Three years later, they wereaccidentally destroyed by fire. A new lazaretto was constructed the following year. The lazaretto was under the management of a ProvincialBoard of Health, each member ofwhich, possessed despotic power. Lepers were hunted like wild beasts, dragged away by an ironhook attached to a long pole, handcuffed, and thrown into a prison, surrounded by a 12 footwall, surmounted by a row of long spikes to prevent escape. When the Medical Super-intendent died suddenly in 1865, 25 year old Dr. Alfred Corbett Smith, a recent graduate ofHarvard Medical School and a native of nearby Bathurst, N.B., was appointed to the position,and remained associated with thelazaretto until his death, 44 years later. When Smith moved to Tracadie in 1865, there were 21patients in the lazaretto. It was very difficult to get people fromthe area to work there, and no proper nursing was available. In September 1868, six nuns fromthe H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Montr\u00e9al were sent to the lazaretto, and under the name of Les ReligieusesHospitali\u00e8res de Saint-Joseph \u00e0 Tracadie, they and their suc- cessors served the establishmentfor 97 years. Six months after the nursing sisters arrived, Dr. Smith's position as Medical Super-intendent was terminated to save money. He and his wife, Helen, moved to Chatham where heopened a general practice. However he retained his interest in leprosy and the leprosarium. T wo years later, in 1871, Joseph-Auguste Babineau becamethe priest of the parish ofTracadie, and as the Super- intendent of the lazaretto and a member of the Board, he wieldedconsiderable power in the running of the institution and in the direction of the sisters. Hedecided who would be admitted as a patient, and had control over treatment. It was around this timethat Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy, was discovered by Norwegian phy-sician G.H.A. Hansen. Before the 1870s were over, the sisters' authority was reduced.Due to faulty diagnoses, patients with skin diseases other than leprosy had been admitted. Someremained for over a year. It became obvious that Babineau and the nuns did not havesufficient medical expertise. As a result, in October 1878, Smith was appointed Consulting Physi-cian to the lazaretto by the New Brunswick Legislature. He advised on in-patient care, and Back of photo, William Osler Photo Collection, CUS_046-31_PB\u00b73\u00b7/orn7flipvisited the lazaretto four times a year, for which he received an annual salary of $200 and travel expenses. However he had noreal jurisdiction in the hospital itself, but visited the surrounding parishes, inspecting homes andfactories, and by \"moral suasion\", removed suspected cases to the hospital. In 1880, the jurisdiction of the lazaretto was transferred to theFederal Department of Agri-culture, after an investigation revealed conflicts of interest and squabbles amongst Board mem-bers. The federal takeover of the lazaretto seemed to result in a sudden curiosity on the part ofthe general public. Throughout the 1880s, a steady stream of reporters, politicians, and theclergy made their way to the Tracadie hospital. The reports that appeared in the newspapersand magazines were not flat- tering. During the summer of 1889, William Osler relocated fromPhiladelphia to the newly opened Johns Hopkins Hospital inBaltimore. According to Harvey Cushing's biography, The Life of Sir William Osler , \"He got away by the end of August for a visit toToronto, and from there in the company with his favouritenephew, W .W . Francis, [11 year old Francis was actually his first- cousin-once-removed] instead ofproceeding to Banff, where the Canadian Medical Association was to meet, he for good andsufficient reasons went to pay a visit to a doctor-friend in charge of the leper colony at Tracadie,on the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the very north-eastern corner of the Province of New Brunswick.New Brunswick is not so large but that some Philadelphia friends who were spending the summeron the Island of Grand Manan, off the southwest corner of theProvince, joined forces with them\". (3) The \"doctor-friend in charge of the leper colony\" was AlfredCorbett Smith, and the \"friends\" with whom they \"joined forces\" were the recently widowed GraceRevere Gross and her closest friend, Sarah Woolley. Osler had known Grace and her latehusband, Dr. Samuel Gross, for some time, and had often been a guest in their home. After thedemise of Samuel, Osler con- tinued to see Grace frequently and often referred to her as \"TheWidow Gross\". In all editions of his textbook, Principles and Practice of Medicine , Osler refers to his trip to Tracadie. In the first edition, published in 1892, he wrote, \"Anendemic focus [of leprosy] is at Tracadie, New Brunswick. A few cases are also met with in CapeBreton, N.S. At Tracadie, which is on a bay of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the disease is limitedto two or three counties which are settled by French Canadians. The disease was imported fromNormandy about the end of the last century. The cases are confined to a lazaretto, to whichthey are sent so soon as the disease is manifest. I made a visit to the settlement two years agowith the medical officer, A.A. Smith ( sic), of Chatham, at which time there were only eighteen patients in the hospital. It is interesting to note that the disease has gradually diminishedby segregation; formerly there were over forty under sur- veillance.\" In the second editionhe corrected A.A. Smith to A.C. Smith. Osler continued to cor- respond with Smith and in latereditions, mentions statistics sent to him by Smith in 1898 and 1904. There does not appear to be any indication that Osler ori-ginally intended to travel toTracadie. The first mention thathe was about to head for New Brunswick was a short, previously unpublished letter, in Osler'shand, to the Minister of the Interior, sent from 83 Wellesley Street, Toronto, and dated only,\"Monday\". It reads, Dear Sir, It is my intention to visit this month the Lazaretto for Lepersat Tracadie. Could you kindlysend me an official letter in order to save any trouble there might be in seeing the place. Yours truly, William OslerProfessor of Medicine Johns Hopkins Univ. Baltimore (5) It appears that when Oslerreached Toronto, on his intendedway to Alberta, he stopped to visit relatives, learned that Grace Gross was vacationing on GrandManan Island, and decided to travel instead to New Brunswick. The only account of his eastwardjourney from Toronto was described years later by W .W . Francis. Osler and Billy Francis went from Toronto, via Montreal toPortland, Maine and on toEastport, \"where\", according to Francis, \"we waited impatiently for a boat from Grand Manan,which was bringing two mys- terious friends to join us. The four of us made the rest of the triptogether, via St. John, Bathurst, and a funny little railway thence to Caraquet, on the Baie deChaleurs, where we were all put up by a very charming family, with some girls who made a lotof me. Next day, the rest of them drove 30 miles to Tracadie and inspected the colony of 18 lepers.I was left behind with 'cold feet', the result of heat, lobsters and seeing some pictures of theOsler continued tosee Gracefrequentlyand oftenreferred we got back to Bathurst and the main line, the train was late, hot and crowded, and the only accommodation leftfor W .O, and me and an enormously fat R.C. bishop was the smoking-room of thePullman. The bishop offered to climb up to the upper berth, but we both looked at his girth, andhe joined us in a laugh. W .O. and I shared the upper, and the bishop snored horribly. We dropped ourcompanions the next day at Cacouna. Such is my childhood recollection. Boiled down, I fearthere is nothing in it but the fact of the visit and that Mrs. Gross accompanied us\". (6) The next letter, and the second in Osler's hand, was to theMinister of Agriculture and waswritten when Osler returned to Johns Hopkins. It is dated Baltimore, Sept. 22nd, 1889, andreads:SirI made an inspection lastmonth of the Lazaretto for Lepers at Tracadie and there are one or two points of publicinterest to which I should like to direct the attention of the department. In the first place the experiment which has therebeen carved out is of thegreatest importance as sho- wing that the careful segrega- tion - even though incompleteis sufficient to reduce greatly the number of cases & diminish the risk to the community. Iknow of nothing more inte- resting in the history of modern Leprosy than the wayin which at Tracadie the disease has been gradually limited & the number ofpatients reduced. Upon this point the Government may be most heartily congratulated.I would like to make with your permission, three sug- gestions. First: The present accom-modation is not at all satisfactory. It is not right thatthe women affected - 8 in number now - should be housed in a garret whichthough clean is altogether too contracted & inadequate. T wo new wards should be built withproper conveniences. Second: As the questions ofthe modes of infection, the exact nature &c of leprosy now become of imperial interestand as the isolated Tracadie settlement offers very ex- ceptional opportunities for thesolution of these problems, I would suggest the appoint- ment for a term of years ofsome one who would give his entire time to the study of the disease as it exists in theinfected regions. Your visiting officer Dr. Smith has been in communication with physi-cians all over the world who are working at this subject & he has the necessary technicalskill to pursue these enquiries - I know of no one more suitable for the position shouldyou create it. Third: An energetic attemptshould be made in the next five years, by an annual house to house inspection of the in-fected counties, to isolate all the cases. Ample power should be given to the officers toremove patients and if ne- cessary, in the case of workers, the government might pensionfor a time the children. I feel certain that within twenty years Leprosy could be stamped out in New Bruns- wick. What has been doneindicates clearly what could be\u00b75\u00b7/orn7flipI have to with thorough inspec- tion & additional police power. The Sisters & Father Babineau are so devoted to the work that with them there could be no serious trouble in the compul-sory segregation of all cases. I have the honour to be Yours truly William Osler MD, F.R.C.P .(Lond)Professor of Medicine Johns Hopkins University Baltimore (4) Osler then wrote a letter to Dr.A.C. Smith in Tracadie. This, infact, was the first of the unpublished letters that we discovered. It was locatedamongst Dr. Smith's papers in the University of Moncton archives in Shippagan, N.B., and was theimpetus that led to the eventualdiscovery of the other un- published letters. Typical of Osler, the letter is dated only,\"Baltimore, Monday 1889\". It reads as follows: Dear Dr. SmithI was away all last week & only had your message last eve onmy return. I have written to the Minister (3 pages) & urged: - (1) the erection of more suitable buildings, (2) the provision for a thorough study of the disease in the infectedregions, (3) the attempt to stamp out by an annual inspection with police powerto remove to the lazaretto. I have urged you as the most suitable person for the study &I have written a private letter to Mr. Carling. I have lost my stenographer or I would sendyou a copy.Thanks for the goodness insending on the letters to Mrs. Gross. Sincerely yours Wm Osler (7) The mention of \"Mrs. Gross\" atthe end of the letter is the only reference by Osler that we havebeen able to find that Grace accompanied him to Tracadie, although her presence wasconfirmed by W.W . Francis, as noted previously. During the months of September and October 1889,Smith had had communications with John Carling and JohnLowe, respectively the Minister and Deputy Minister of Agriculture, regarding mainlysegregation of lepers. On October 21, 1889, a letter was written from Dr. J.C. Tach\u00e9, theformer Deputy Minister of Agriculture, to John Lowe. This letter reads: My dear Mr. Lowe : - Concerning the questions approached in Documents respectively numbered 70,653, 70,719 and 70,724, (Dr. Smith,Dr. Smith, Dr. Osler) which herewith return to you, and on which you demanded myopinion, I have to say that I generally hold with Drs. Smith and Osler, that it is desirableto provide for compulsory means of seclusion when persuasion fails to bring it indue time, and to secure by an increase of the salary of the visiting physician (Dr. Smith),a large portion, if not the whole of his time for the discovery, inspection and seclusion ofnew cases of Leprosy within the Canadian territory. This opinion is not a new notionwith me; oftentimes have I taken it up for consideration in the course of my official life,coupled with the view thatThe visit /orn7flip \u00b76\u00b7 persons taken with Leprosy are not to be outlawed or treated like criminals, or considered asobjects of horror, but dealt with, as heretofore they have been, as unfortunates to beespecially attended to, both in their and the public interest. J.C. Tach\u00e9 (8) The fifth letter was written by Dr. Alfred Smith on Oct. 31, 1889, to John Carling, the Minister of Agriculture, stating that for afixed annual salary of six hundred dollars plus traveling expenses, he would work full time at thelazaretto. Smith states that he is willing to \"devote all of my time and attention, in addition to anypresent duties in education with the Tracadie lazaretto, to the study of Leprosy in theDominion of Canada, and to the stamping of it out of our country\". (9) Shortly thereafter Smith was hired as the full time physician for the lazaretto, and within a few years of Osler's visitand letters, a new lazaretto was constructed. In conclusion, we describe here five letters, discovered seren-dipitously, relating directly to William Osler's visit to thelazaretto in Tracadie. Three of the letters were written by Osler himself. The visit and lettersundoubtedly played a role in improving the conditions in the lazaretto and the treatment ofleprosy in Canada, as well as the career of Dr. A.C. Smith. How- ever, we never did find anexplanation why Osler took Grace, the woman he soon married, or why he intended totake 11 year old Willy to thelazaretto. Osler and Grace kept their courtship a secret until the day of the wedding and neitherleft any letters or other accounts of their trip together to Tracadie. Osler mentions his visit to the lazaretto in all editions of his textbook, but nowhere does he mention his companions. Grace'spapers were destroyed after her death at her request. In the 21 st century it is quite acceptable for an unmarried couple to travel together. Would it have been equally acceptable in Victorian19 th century? /bullet1 References and Notes 1.

Carling, Department A O NE DAY COLLOQUY ON HEALING by Chris Lyons Sir William Osler means many things to many people - a great physician, a great researcher, a great teacher and a great bibliophile. These myriad roles have inspired pastand present students and prac- titioners in the art of healing. On Saturday, September 27 th 24 people gathered at the Osler Library to consider the theme of healing and the role of the healer.The background of the speakers ranged from physicians, those living with their own or a familymember's illness, a minister/ therapist and yes, even a librarian. Dr. David Elpern, the co-organiser of the colloquy and the first speaker, set the day in a proper Oslerian context byquoting from an extemporaneous speech that Sir William gave in 1899 to medical students inAlbany, New York. Osler had told the gathered students that: There is a strong feeling abroadamong people - you see it in the newspapers - that wedoctors are given over now- adays to science; that we care much more for the disease andits scientific aspects than for the individual. I don't believe it, but at any rate, whether thetendency exists or not, I would urge upon you in your own practice, to care more parti-cularly ... for the individual patient than for the special features of the disease ...Dealing as we do with poorsuffering humanity, we see the man unmasked, exposed to all the frailties and weaknesses,and you have to keep your heart soft and tender lest you have too great a contempt foryour fellow creatures. The best way is to keep a looking-glass in your own heart, and themore carefully you scan your own frailties the more tender you are for those of your fellowcreatures. Dr. Elpern stated that readingautobiographies about the illnesses of others, a genre called pathography, helped him toremain in touch with \"poor suffering humanity\" and provided an education beyond what hereceived in academia. He said that they allowed him to see the secret world of patients, theirsuffering and their not always pleasant feelings towards their care or caregivers. He illustratedthis with a poem written by the late comedian Gilda Radner in her book about her battle withovarian cancer:were increasing his suffering.Hospice care, in contrast, provided him with the chance to live the last few months of his lifeaccepting and preparing for death, in part by consciously spending time with his family.Andy DeAngelis is a younger man who has lived with lamellar ichthyosis, a sometimes de-bilitating skin ailment. He too described the frustrations of dealing with insensitive healthcare providers, but more op- timistically noted how positive interactions with members of themedical profession have allowed him to live a fulfilling life. Several medical speakers discussed their sense of what itmeans to be a healer. Dr. Thomas Hutchinson, who is with theMcGill Programs in Whole Person Care and who teaches in the physicianship programme,described the nature of the doctor-patient relationship which can help healing by beingaware that there are two relationships - between the doctor and the patient andbetween the doctor and the Doctors are whippersnappers in ironed white coats who spy up your rectums and look down your throatsAnd press you and poke you with sterilized toolsAnd stab at solutions that pacify fools.I used to revere them and do what they saidTill I learned what they learned on was already dead.(It's Always Something, Harper, 2000) This sense of patient alienation from health professionalswas expressed by two of the other speakers. Deborah Golden Alecson described how she wasfrustrated by the medical profes- sion's attempts to keep her husband alive at all costs duringhis struggle with pancreatic cancer despite an obvious lack of success. Indeed the treatmentsdisease. Often practitioners cutthemselves off from their patientand focus on the disease in part to protect themselves from a sense of failure if the curativemodel doesn't work. The irony is that this kind of distancing actually can increase the like-lihood of burnout since one then misses out on the positive aspects of a good relationship with theSir William linked booksto regardless of the ultimate outcome. Dr. Bill Kober spoke of the importance of using humour when working with patients,noting that U.S. author Kurt Vonnegut described it as the soul seeking its release. Given thatOsler humanised the relationship between doctors and patients, current practitioners should notbe afraid to use a new form of therapeutic relief, which he dubbed Osler's laugh. Physicianassistant Brian Mauer pointed out that everyone can benefit by listening to the stories of others.Even Sir William Osler had to deal with the tragedy of the loss of his own son. The theme of thewounded healer was also dis- cussed by the Reverend Bill Zeckhausen, a Congregationalminister who is a therapist with experience running physician support groups. He felt thathaving gone through trauma themselves gives doctors cre- dibility as healers. In addition to the pre- sentations, participants weregiven a tour of the Osler Libraryalong with a discourse on how Sir William linked books to im- proved medical practice, not onlyin terms of providing utilitarian information but also to inspire them to develop a greaternobility of character. Part of what made the day feel like such a success were theinteresting questioning, dis- cussions and conversations that took place both after eachpresentation and during the breaks and lunch. Everyone was particularly pleased to see agoodly number of medical and nursing students attend as it bespeaks an interest in thisimportant topic. The Osler Library was particularly delighted to host this event as it gave us theopportunity to propagate Sir William Osler's enduring legacy. /bullet1ROLAND 'S CANADIAN MEDICAL HISTORY MINIATURES by Charles Roland Robert Bell - Medical Geologist If you ever happen to be standing on the bank looking across Bell River, in north- western Quebec, or seek a campsite in Bell Island, in Hudson Bay, you can impress your companions by pointing outthat both geographical features are named after a Canadian physician. This man was RobertBell (1841-1917), a doctor who seems never to have actually practiced medicine. Bell was descended from Scots who came to Canada almost twocenturies ago. Both his father andhis father's father were ministers of the Church of Scotland. The father, the Rev. Andrew Bell, wasa pioneer of Canadian geology, and whether by nature or nurture his son Robert followed the samepath. One of the many fascinations of Bell's life is his unusualeducational history. After his first years at the grammar school in Prescott County, he went on tostudy at McGill. There he received his degree in Applied Science in 1861 and his MD in1878. But he had joined the staff of the Geological Survey of Canada in 1857, aged 16. Andwhen he retired in 1908 he was still with the Survey, his salary after 51 years having arrived atthe munificent sum of $3,000 annually. According to one obituary notice, Bell studied medicine soas to be equipped \"to meetemergencies that might arise inthe course of his exploratory journeys.\" That would help toexplain his rather odd edu- cational history. Whether or not he ever utilized his training isuncertain. He did attempt to teach, at Queen's, and was found to be incapable of maintainingorder in his classes. Snowballs and other items were thrown about the room, students talkedamong themselves; of course, medical students were a pretty rough-and-ready lot in the mid-19 th-century. In 1873 he and William Osler happened to be in London,England, at the same time. Bell obviously was already known to Osler and he was interested inmedicine. Osler once wrote to him saying \"if you feel inclined to see any practice I shall be mosthappy to show you around the wards.\" A decade later, Osler was soliciting Indian skulls from Bellto take with him for the anthropological collections of Rudolf Virchow in Germany. Robert Bell. ISO, FRS, MD, CM, DSc, andresearchershavedisplayed...His connection with medicine tenuous, Bell was a geologist first and last. He spent much of his adult life in the remotest parts ofCanada. His surveys took him through a great portion of northern Quebec and Ontario,the area around Hudson Bay, northern Manitoba, Alberta, and the Northwest Territories.Among the rivers he surveyed were the Slave, Athabaska, Beaver, Churchill, Hayes,Nelson, Winnipeg, English, Nipigon, Moose, Harricanaw, Nottaway, and presumably theBell. He believed firmly in the economic good sense of ex- porting wheat to Europe viaHudson Bay. Bell was not the typical heavy- handed European intruder in thewilderness. He learned to speak Ojibway and other aboriginal languages, so that he couldconverse with the native popu- lation. He was deeply interested in the folklore of these people, and collected native legends, many hundreds of them. Hisintelligent and sympathetic interest was, evidently, appre- ciated, for at Grand Lake,Quebec, Bell was made an honorary chief of the Algonquin Indians. He was careful to seeknative names for geographical features, and may have had the good grace to be embarrassedwhen his own name was attached to features that undoubtedly had earlier designations. Never-theless, he is credited with naming more than 3,000 lakes, rivers, hills, valleys, andmountains. In 1884, Bell was medical officer and geologist (almostcertainly with the emphasis on geologist) to the Neptune expe- dition, and to the Alert expedition the next year. Both expeditionswere spared serious epidemic or low-vitamin disorders, while thegeological contributions to ourknowledge of the Arctic weresubstantial. Surprisingly, perhaps, despite spending a substantial part of hislife exploring northern Canada, Bell was married. Little seems to be known about his family life.He lived in brief retirement in Ottawa, then on a farm he purchased in Manitoba. There hedied in June 1917. /bullet1 ANNUAL APPEAL TO THE FRIENDS 2008 The Healing Hands depicted here is taken from awoodcut done by Nova Scotia artist Robert Pope (1956- 1992) who died after a ten year battle with cancer. In hisdiscussion of this work he speaks of the healing power of hands, \"The lines symbolize curative lifeenergy flowing inside and outside the body.\" Hands are symbolic of a library as well. We think ofhelping hands and hands on experiences. The stained glass window designed by PercyNobbs in the Osler Room depicts the heavenly hand and book, symbolizing learning and scho-larship. When I think of this past year, \"energy\" is the word that best describes what our staff andresearchers have displayed thanks to the help of our Friends. This has been a great year for projects and for unusual and welcome gifts. We have con-tinued to purchase the incredible books that are published each year on the history and socialstudies of medicine, over 1,600 volumes. We have been fortunate enough to purchase rare works tofill gaps in our collection and wehave received some stunning gifts. Added to this is the happy opportunity each year, alsoprovided by our Friends, of conserving fragile works in order to make them available toresearchers for years to come. Remarkable projects include \"The William Osler PhotoCollection\" and the addition of over 8,000 volumes covering the period of 1850 to 1913 from theLife Sciences Library holdings in remote storage! A list of our recent purchases can always be found on our web page, but the following titles give youa brief overview of the range of material that you can expect to find here. A fascinating newarrival is Medieval Islamic Medicine, Washington, 2007 by Peter E.Pormann and Emilie SavageSmith that among other topics describes the interaction between Islamic, Christian and Jewishpractitioners and sweeps away some of the cobwebs surrounding Islam's contribution to medicine. \"Healing Hands\" on pgs. 108-109 in Robert Pope's Illness & Images of ouroutstandingholdings ofthe works ofThomasWillis. \u00b710\u00b7 One of our most useful purchases is the New Dictionary of Scientific Biography , Editor-in-Chief Noretta Koertge, published by specialarrangement with the American Council of Learned Societies with Thomson Gale, 2008, an 8volume update of the 1970 edition. This edition includes portraits of the subjects and as itis not available on-line, is well worth consulting here. In addition, Dr. Theodore Sourkes,Chairman of our Standing Committee, has contributed a biography of J.L.W . Thudichumto this new edition. Gerard W . Boychuk's National Health Insurance in the United States and Canada, Race, T erritory, and the Roots of Difference , Georgetown University Press,2008, is intended to add a newdimension to the discussion of why neighbours have taken a different approach to a burningquestion. Observing Bioethics by Ren\u00e9e C. Fox and Judith P .Swazey, Oxford University Press,2008, examines the development of this field (not uncritically) following World War II. At a timewhen there is a revival of interestin life-like anatomical models,Flesh and Wax, the Clemente Susini's Anatomical Models in the University of Cagliari, edited by Allessandro Riva, Ilisso 2007, provides a highly illustrated folio volume that offers a detailed history ofwax modelling, focussing on the artistic and scientific importance of the work of Clemente Susini,1754-1814. Stanley Burns has presented us with his latest book in a series on medical photo-graphy, this one dedicated to Osler's distinguished senior colleague and friend Silas WeirMitchell (1829-1914). Entitled Seeing Insanity , New York 2007, Dr. Burns uses photography to chart the history of psychiatry with the hope that understanding past practices will promote theimprovement of future treatment. Among the most exciting of our rare book purchases are two works by Charles Bell (1774- 1842). William Osler assembleda very good collection of Bell's works, but somehow these eluded him: A System of Dissections, Explaining the Anatomy of the HumanBody... , Edinburgh, 1799-1801 and Engravings from Specimens of Morbid Parts... , London, 1813. Another purchase is Anatomia disegno... by Bernardino Genga(1620-1690), believed to be thebest professional atlas of its time, published for artists. Wilhelm Braune's (1831-1892) T opographisch -anatomischer Atlas , Leipzig, 1872, is a fine addition to a heavily usedcollection. Over the last year Dr. William Feindel has added to ouroutstanding holdings of the works of Thomas Willis. These include: Cerebri anatome, cui accessit nervorum... great work on comparative neuroanatomy and the first workof medical psychology in England; The remaining medical works of that famous and renowned physician Dr. Thomas Willis... \"Englished by Samuel Pordage ...\" London, 1681, a folio, bound withPharmaceutice rationalis or an exercitation of the operations...1679. To celebrate William Osler's 159 th birthday (and Dr. Feindel's 90th) Dr. Feindel presented us with thethird edition of Ren\u00e9 Descartes'Opera philosophia , published in Amsterdam in 1656. Emeritus Librarian, David Crawford, continues to add to our collection of hospital histories, particularlyvery welcome histories of Canadian hospitals. The Elliott family has donated 7 manuscript war diaries of Dr. Harold Elliott, (1907-1973)McGill MDCM 1936, a neuro- surgeon who worked at the Royal Victoria Hospital, the MontrealNeurological Institute and at the Montreal General Hospital. During World War II, Dr. Elliott L to R: Mr. William Pope, Mrs. Pamela Miller, Prof. Carman Miller, Mrs. Isabel Pope and Mrs. Janet Murray (photo by Dr. Jock Murray)\u00b711\u00b7/orn7flipHer gift to a member of aMethodistfamilydemonstratesEllen Osler'smissionaryskill. served overseas with the No. 1 Canadian Neurological Hospital. His subsequent career centred on neurosurgery at the MontrealGeneral Hospital concentrating on the prevention of traffic accidents. The diaries are illus-trated with newspaper clippings and several small water colour sketches by the author. Coin-cidentally, the gift came at the same time as the following donation, and contains referencesto Sir Geoffrey Jefferson and to Lady Jefferson. Andrew Jefferson of Kent, England, the grandson of Sir Geoffrey and Lady Jefferson,donated 13 letters from William Osler to by Osler, andthree period of 1909 to 1918. Gertrude Flumerfelt was the very attractivedaughter of a wealthy Canadian business man from the west coast, Alfred Cornelius Flumerfelt. Shewas admitted to do clinical studies in Manchester, married her fellow-student (Sir) GeoffreyJefferson and had a distinguishedcareer in England in psychiatry.She was a frequent guest of the Oslers at Oxford, with whom she developed a warm friendship.Included in the gift are nine pages of Gertrude Flumerfelt's re- collections of Osler. HarveyCushing would have had access to these letters while writing Osler's biography, but theseletters are the originals and are truly fun, revealing the teasing side of Osler's character whoconsistently downplayed her ability to succeed in medicine as a female, while at the same timeproviding introductions to colleagues who could help her on her way. A copy of the Book of Common Prayer , London, 1847 was do- nated by Dr. Karen Smith. The inscription reads \"Mary Ann Ludlow from Mrs. Osler, TecumsehParsonage, Dec. 24 th, 1848. I will pray with the spirit and I will praywith the understanding also. 1Corinthians XIV . c. 1830-1899from the Wesleyan-MethodistChurch and the WesleyanMethodist Church in Canada in the name of several members of the Ludlow family. According toMichael Bliss, the Methodists were a real thorn in the side of Featherstone Osler due to theirhighly emotional approach to religion and their attacks on his church. Her gift to a member ofa Methodist family demonstrates Ellen Osler's missionary skill. (Our alert evaluator provided thestunning calculation from the date of the inscription that Ellen Osler was three months along inthe pregnancy that produced William Osler!) The donor, Dr. Smith, is a descendant of theLudlow family. Donations of archives and artifacts this year include a framed letter from William Osler in 1901 announcing to Mrs A.T.Carver, the very serious illness with little hope of recovery, of her brother. Patty Vogel and hermother Mrs. Eleanor Bradsher are the donors (Mrs. A.T. Carver was Patty Vogel's great grandmother.) Margaret Saul donated a 74 pp typescript entitled \"Neighboursin Kashmir\" written by Dr. Minnie Gomery in 1951 about her service as a medical mis-sionary in Kashmir. Dr. Gomery graduated from Bishop's Medical College, winning the Wood GoldMedal, included in the donation, for the 1897-1898 session. The gift includes a Kashmiri hymnbook, a small photo album, the guest book for the John Bishop Memorial Hospital, Islamabad,1902-1935, plus photos, clip- pings and miscellaneous biogra- phical from William Gertrude Flumerfeld Jefferson, April 1st, 1910 the distinguishedsurgeon Baron Dominique Larrey (1766-1842), appointed Surgeon -in-Chief to the French army byNapoleon in 1805. This is a letter of recommendation for a young friend, written a year beforeLarrey's death, to M. Brissot, Inspector General of la Salubrit\u00e9 de Paris. Dr. Stuart Kenning has donated a splendid collection of 10medals commemorating famous medical figures, but most importantly 2 gold medals fromCanadian medical faculties including the Robert Nelson Medal from the University ofBishops College (1890) awarded for special examination in surgery to James Laurie and theHutchinson Medal from the Manitoba Medical College awarded to Frederick WilliamAndrew for highest aggregate in medical courses, 1907. The Osler Library has a collection of about70 medals and these are important additions. Conservator Terry Rutherford has taken up permanent resi- dence in Montreal which meansthat she can now work moreeasily on our most valuable items. Her work this year includes the restoration of a number of superbworks, much in demand by researchers and specialized student groups. A selectionincludes: William , Boston, 1817-1820, 3 volumes whose bindings were crumbling but whose illustrations are glorious, Symphorien Champier's Index Librorum , Lyon, 1517, Illustrations of the Operations of Surgery , Charles Bell, London, 1821, Johann Caspar Lavater's Essays on Physiognomy... , London, 1850 and Bernhard SiegfriedAlbinus' Tables of the Skeleton and Muscles of the Human Body , London, 1749 [an elephant folio one ofwhose pages was torn almost inhalf.] It really is rewarding to know that thanks to your help, these works can be studied andeven displayed, for many years to come. Exhibitions highlight our exceptional collections but they also provide guest curators withthe opportunity to display their research interests. As reported in the last Newsletter, at the end ofJune, Allister Neher of the Humanities Department of Dawson College presented anexhibition entitled, Art Anatomy and the Representation of Knowledge . Thanks to a grant from theHannah Foundation, the exhi- bition is accompanied by a catalogue, which we are givingaway in the Library. By coincidence this fall we are displaying two exhibitions simultaneously, but with one theme in common, namely artand medicine. Along with Allister Neher's exhibition, we are displaying nine copies ofpaintings by Robert Pope, theyoung artist mentioned at the beginning of this report. This has come about thanks to Dr. JockMurray and William Pope, the artist's father. Dr. Murray is a member of the Board of Gover-nors of the Pope Foundation, a foundation dedicated to perpe- tuating the work of Robert Popewhose paintings depict illness from the patient's perspective and provide rare and touchinginsights into the patient's experience with modern medi- cine, family and caregivers. Dr.Murray gave the address at the annual White Coat Ceremony at McGill held for second yearmedical students on the 3 rd of October. Each class memberreceived a copy of Robert Pope'sIllness & Healing: Images of Cancer. Every year we like to focus on a particular project. Over the last few years, we have ensured that our French theses were cata-logued. This year we have hired a student in the School of Information Studies, DuncanCowie, to carry out the Hercu- lean task of putting order into the 88 metres of archives ofprominent Montreal cardiologist Harold Nathan Segall. The project is carried out with fundsfrom our Friends and will result in an inventory to a unique source for research on cardiology inMontreal from the 1920s, to the 1970s. It has been a great year for projects because of a generous donation of $25,000 from theMcGovern Foundation. With the close collaboration of Louise O'Neill and the department ofLibrary Technology Services, Assistant History of Medicine Librarian Chris Lyons has spenta great deal of time and energy managing a project to digitize the photos assembled by Harvey Dr. S. William Gunn presenting the manuscript letter by Baron Dominique Larrey to Dr. William Feindel\u00b713\u00b7/orn7flipCushing while he wrote his biography of Osler. \"Managing\" includes organizing numerous meetings to coordinate content,cataloguing standards, digital quality, search requirements and design. The report that follows,by Jacqueline Barlow on her work cataloguing the contents of The William Osler PhotographCollection, explains in depth the complicated process of cata- loguing photographs so that thepublic will have easy access to a rich resource. It has been a wonderful project and allconcerned feel gratified by the results. Chris' energy has also been spent on the transfer ofabout 8,000 volumes from the Life Sciences remote storage facility to the Osler Library'spost-1840 storage facility, the H. Rocke Robertson Room as well as to Redpath open accessstorage. This has required months of planning but will ultimately result in far easieraccess to this impressive resource. I hope that this report gives you a picture of the excitement generated by your help and our gratitude to you. It launches ourannual appeal, and as you can see, we depend on you. Thank you. /bullet1 THE WILLIAM OSLER PHOTO COLLECTION by Jacqueline Barlow My first inkling of the digitization of the Cushing Collection came in March of this year, when Chris Lyons, Assistant History of Medicine Librarian, asked me ifI'd be interested in working on it. I had been working at the Osler Library for almost a year as Library and Archives Assistant, apart-time job while I finished my Master of Library and Infor- mation Studies degree. Thedigitization project would provide me with a job right after graduation, and valuable ex-perience to boot - digitization is big business these days in the world of archives and libraries. Ihappily accepted the offer. I wasn't sure, at the time, what the Cushing Collection reallywas. As I came to learn well in the following months, the collection began when HarveyCushing started research on his classic biography, The Life of Sir William Osler . He canvassed far and wide for recollections ofOsler and letters from him. Bypublishing requests in major newspapers and medical journals,writing to anyone who knew Osler, and visiting the homes of Osler's family members, Cushingamassed a large collection of papers and photographs chro- nicling Osler's life, and The Life of Sir William Osler was published in 1925. In 1932, Cushing depo-sited this collection at the OslerLibrary in Montreal. But it did not remain unchanged after it was deposited in the archives.Beginning with W .W . Francis, a succession of Osler Librarians continued to add to thecollection new photographs, letters, and other documents relating to Osler's life, as theywere given to the library. In this way - a way that would horrify In archivists I'm acquainted with - the Cushing collection came to contain a good deal of material that Cushing himselfhad never seen. At some point in the history of the collections, the photos wereseparated from the papers, to be stored in more suitable con- ditions. (This would make thearchivists feel a little better.) In certain cases, letters and notes which pertained to the photo-graphs were kept with the photo collection. The photographs were organized into sections thatcorresponded with the periods of Osler's life: his boyhood in Bond Head and Dundas, Ontario; hisschoolboy days in Barrie and Weston, and first years at university in Toronto; his longand productive stay in Montreal, as a medical student and then as a physician, professor andlecturer; his brief stint at the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia; the pinnacle of hiscareer, his sixteen glorious years at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore; and the latter days ofhis life as Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University. There were also separate sectionsfor photographs of Lady Osler, their son Revere Osler, and the Osler and Francis families.All of this makes the Cushing Collection an interesting and informative collection, but it is by no means the only interestingand informative photographic collection at the Osler Library, nor, by extension, at McGillUniversity. Why was this col- lection chosen to be digitized? A few years ago at the Osler Library another collection ofphotos, two albums in fragile condition, assembled by MarjorieHoward Futcher (see The Osler Library Newsletter no. 92) was digitized purely for preservationpurposes. This preservation project caught the eye of Alan Burk, who was then working as adigital consultant at McGill University Libraries. The Libra- ries had been looking for acollection that could act as a pilot project for future digitization efforts at the university. Whilethe original digitized albums were ultimately not chosen, the Cushing Collection was soonidentified as a suitable pilot project for a number of reasons. Among these reasons was thelarge and enthusiastic audience for a site about Osler's life; and a generous donation from theMcGovern Foundation was the deciding factor.Early this year, meetings began in earnest to plan the digitizationof the Cushing photos, which was proving to be a big under-taking. At that time the \"team\" consisted of Alan Burk, Pamela Miller and Chris Lyons of theOsler Library, Greg Houston and Elizabeth Thomson of the Digital Program, Megan Chellew ofCollection Services, and Louise O'Neill Associate Director of Library Technology Services.Not long afterwards, I was recruited to go through the photos and, under the super-vision of Chris Lyons and Pamela Miller, evaluate them based on quality and content. Once wehad agreed on which photos should be included, Deepak Mathews, a McGill student,began scanning them. Scanning took place through the month of May. Meanwhile, I was busyapplying metadata to - basically, cataloguing - the photos. All told, digitizing 400 items took agood part of the time of six people over a six month period. And the team continued to meetand hash out some of the project's thornier issues. Now that those thorny issues have been tamed, The WilliamOsler Photo Collection is up and running and may be found athttp://digital.library.mcgill.ca/ osler . My time at the Osler Library, sadly, has come to an end, but I'm quite confident that The William Osler Photo Collection will be a great success,an achievement to be proud of, and an outstanding resource, not just for the community ofOslerians but for any interested party. At the very least, the website will increase awareness ofWilliam Osler's life and achie- vements, which the Osler Library has long endeavoured to do. /bullet1 Jacqueline Barlow in the Francis Seminar Room at the Osler Library\u00b715\u00b7/orn7flipThe Library gratefullyacknowledgesthe support ithas receivedfrom Friends.FRIENDS LIBRARY The Library gratefully acknowledges the sup- port it has received from Friends, both old and new, who have responded to the appeal for funds for the 2007-2008 acade-mic year.
