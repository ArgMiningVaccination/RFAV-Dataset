Physical - Florida 2030 SHEALY DR GAINESVILLE FL 32608 Brucellosis in Livestock in Rwanda, Africa Brucellosis is a disease that can cause abortion and reduced milk yield in cattle, as well as fever and chronic fatigue in humans. Socio-economic consequences of Brucella spp. infections include forced unemployment and cost of treatment in infected people, reduced family livestock-related income, as well as interruption of trade in animals and animal products. Vaccination or test-and-slaughter are cost-effective control interventions in high-income countries (e.g., USA). As part of my PhD research, I will assess and compare the costs and benefits of adopting control interventions (vaccination, test-and-slaughter, versus a status-quo scenario) to reduce the burden of brucellosis in livestock in Rwanda; a low-income country with 13 million people and 1.3 million cows. My research will inform policy makers on the socio-economic consequences of acting, or failing to act, on policy options of selected intervention scenarios in livestock populations in Rwanda. - Disease Modeling -

After graduation, I worked for one year as a beef and dairy cattle veterinary practitioner, mostly doing reproductive and nutrition related activities. Then, in June 2019, I had the privilege of being accepted as a Research Scholar in the Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences at the University of Florida under the supervision of Dr. Klibs Galv\u00e3o. After completing a year as a Research Scholar, I was accepted into the Animal Molecular and Cellular Biology Master of Science graduate program, also under the supervision of Dr. Galv\u00e3o. I graduated from the master's program in July 2021. Right upon graduation I was granted the admission to the PhD program in Veterinary Medical Sciences through the Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences at the University of Florida's College of Veterinary Medicine for Fall term 2021 under the guidance of Dr. Klibs Galv\u00e3o.
