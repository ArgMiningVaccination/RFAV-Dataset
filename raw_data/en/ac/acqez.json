If successful, the study by Queen Mary University of London and Barts Health NHS Trust could change how high blood pressure is treated in adults and even replace the need for daily tablets in some patients. An estimated 15 million people in the UK have high blood pressure - around 28 per cent of adults - and at least half of them are not receiving effective treatment. Left untreated, having high blood pressure significantly increases the risk of a heart attack or stroke. Around 50 per cent of strokes are associated with high blood pressure. 'Exciting trial' Professor Sir Nilesh Samani, our Medical Director, said: \"This exciting trial could lead to good news for the millions of people across the UK with high blood pressure, many of whom need to take daily medication to lower their risk of heart attacks and strokes. \"The study will determine whether an injection given twice a year lowers blood pressure sufficiently over a prolonged period. \"If this proves to be the case, it may provide an alternative to taking daily pills for some patients.\" Many patients with high blood pressure typically take tablets once a day to control the condition, with ACE inhibitors being the most common medication prescribed. The trial will investigate if an injection-based drug - Zilebesiran - could inhibit the production of a protein called angiotensinogen (AGT). Inhibiting this protein could prevent the constriction of blood vessels which may help to reduce high blood pressure. An injection-based drug to treat cholesterol was recently tested and approved for use by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). TOP TIPS TO REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE "}
