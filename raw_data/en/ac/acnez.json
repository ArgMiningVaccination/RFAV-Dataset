The book is organized primarily by identifying herbs that support the various systems of the body: cardiovascular, digestive, immune-lymphatic, musculoskeletal, nervous, respiratory, skin (the integument system), sexual/reproductive, etc., but is interspersed with anecdotes, meditations, case studies, and plant profiles. Included are recipes and remedies, preparations, dosage recommendations and safety guidelines.\" \u2014Tara Kanoti, The Herb Society of America \"The Gift of Healing Herbs is a gift to all of us from Robin Rose Bennett. ...

Throughout this book she gently reminds us of numerous ways to connect deeply and authentically with plants, how to nurture these profound relations, and ultimately appreciate the multiple levels of medicine they have to offer. ... [The Gift of Healing Herbs] will help you remember that it is possible to walk a healing path that is in alignment with your own true nature\u2014that radiant beauty that is uniquely you.\" \u2014Herb Geek \"Composed of personal stories, case histories, recipes, basic plant information, and instructions on how to use herbal remedies to treat a number of physical, emotional, and spiritual ailments, The Gift of Healing Herbs looks to be an engaging introduction to the myriad ways in which herbology can affect our bodies and minds.\" \u2014Ashley Brooke Roberts, Barnes & Noble Book Blog \"[Robin Rose Bennett's] work leads us straight to the truth of the interconnectedness of all life.
