Salt: A teaspoon of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the zucchini bread taste salty. Leaveners: Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners, which means they help the zucchini bread rise. Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon lends warmth and depth of flavor. Eggs: Three whole eggs add moisture and help bind the batter together. Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds even more moisture. Sugar: White sugar sweetens things up. Some reviewers say they prefer to use a blend of white and brown sugars. Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the zucchini bread. Use store-bought or homemade vanilla extract. Zucchini: You'll need two cups of freshly grated zucchini. Nuts: This recipe calls for walnuts, but you can use pecans (or the nuts of your choice) if you wish. How Do You Make Zucchini Bread?
