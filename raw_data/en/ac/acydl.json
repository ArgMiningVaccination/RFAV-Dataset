The Polio Eradication & Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018 (the Endgame Strategy) (3) set the goal of a polio-free world by 2018. Achieving this goal requires: (i) completion of eradication to eliminate the risk of wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission; (ii) cessation of the use of OPV to eliminate the risks and (iii) implementation of poliovirus safe-handling and containment measures to minimize the risks of a facility-associated reintroduction of virus into the polio-free community. The first step towards cessation of trivalent OPV (tOPV) use will be the withdrawal of OPV type 2 (OPV2), which has caused over 90% of cVDPV cases since the eradication of WPV2 in 1999. The resulting bivalent OPV (bOPV, types 1 and 3) will replace tOPV in global immunization programmes, facilitated by the introduction of at least one dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), composed of all three virus types. Providing adequate IPV doses for all OPV-using countries will require both volume purchasing of existing IPV products and developing alternative low-cost IPV options (e.g. Sabin-IPV) for developing countries to meet programmatic needs. Until cessation of OPV use, bOPV will be the vaccine of choice to respond to any WPV type 1 (WPV1) and WPV type 3 (WPV3) outbreaks, while monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2) will be the choice for responding to type 2 outbreaks. After OPV cessation, a combination of type- specific mOPV and IPV will be used to respond to any WPV or vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) outbreak. Global consensus to stop bOPV will require international assurance that the transmission of wild and vaccine-derived poliovirus has been interrupted; affordable, safe and effective IPVs are available; potential outbreaks from undetected or newly emerged cVDPV can be controlled; and the risk from facility-associated reintroduction of wild or OPV/Sabin polioviruses can be minimized. This third edition of the Global Action Plan (GAPIII) aligns the safe handling and containment of poliovirus infectious and potentially infectious materials with the WHO Endgame Strategy and replaces both the 2009 draft version of the third edition posted on the GPEI website and the second edition of the WHO Global Action Plan for laboratory containment of wild polioviruses (6). The third edition: describes timelines and requirements to be: completed in preparation for poliovirus type 2 containment implemented throughout the poliovirus type 2 containment period applied in the post-eradication and post-bOPV phase; 1 WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII)IntROductIOn addresses type-specific containment of WPV as well as OPV/Sabin polioviruses, consistent with the goal of sequential cessation of OPV use after type-specific WPV eradication (7); balances the need for equitable access to polioviruses, e.g. for vaccine production, throughout the poliovirus type 2 containment and post-eradication period, against the risk based on assessment findings, consequence models (8) and management strategies (Annexes 2 and 3); establishes the long-term goal of minimizing the risk of facility-associated poliomyelitis in the post-eradication/post-bOPV era by providing continued access to safe and affordable IPV or Sabin-IPV and by reducing to a minimum the number of facilities handling and storing polioviruses while serving critical functions and meeting all required safeguards. GAPIII is an evolving document, subject to revisions as new information emerges relevant to achieving the appropriate balance between community risk and the systems and controls to manage that risk. The poliovirus \"Biorisk management standard\" (Annexes 2 and 3) provides the framework for facility certification based on the principles of a biorisk management system. This standard requires the institution/facility to understand the risks associated with its activities and to manage those risks in ways acceptable to the national and international bodies responsible for the oversight of work with polioviruses. National authorities are responsible for reviewing the application of these risk management standards and principles in local circumstances. Although Annexes 2 and 3 are written specifically for wild polioviruses and OPV/Sabin strains, respectively, as they exist at the present time, should novel strains emerge that are considered to be more attenuated, less pathogenic and safer than OPV/Sabin strains, the evidence will be reviewed by a panel of scientific experts convened by WHO to consider the controls applicable to their containment and safe handling. WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII)IntROductIOn 2RATIONALE When WPV circulation is interrupted, interest in immunization against polio is expected to decline and population susceptibility will increase in many parts of the world. A reintroduction of WPV from a poliovirus facility risks the potentially serious consequences of re-establishing poliovirus transmission. When the use of OPV stops, many countries will continue high population coverage with IPV, other countries will have suboptimal IPV coverage, and still others may discontinue all national polio immunization activities. A reintroduction of an OPV/Sabin strain from a facility risks unrecognized virus transmission, reversion to cVDPV, and again the potential serious consequences of re-establishing poliovirus transmission (8). Most countries will have no need to retain live polioviruses in the post-eradication and post-OPV era. Facility-associated risks in these countries can be eliminated by a thorough nationwide search for and destruction of all WPV and all OPV/Sabin infectious and potentially infectious materials. Some countries will host a limited number of poliovirus facilities that serve critical international functions, including IPV and Sabin-IPV production, production and storage of mOPV stockpiles, vaccine quality assurance, diagnostic reagent production, virus diagnostic and reference functions, together with crucial research. Each of these poliovirus-essential facilities should manage biorisk appropriately to minimize the risk of virus reintroduction into the community, with effective national certification and WHO verification programmes. The risk from a poliovirus reintroduction can be minimized by locating poliovirus-essential facilities in areas with high levels of population immunity, effective acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and environmental surveillance, supplemented by efficient public health and response capacity. Consequences can be further minimized by working only with OPV/Sabin or alternative, more attenuated strains, which have lower basic reproduction rates (R 0) than WPV (8). Minimizing the number of poliovirus-essential facilities worldwide further reduces the magnitude of the risk, facilitates national and international oversight, and strengthens the likelihood that global containment standards can be met and successfully maintained. 3 WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII)RAtIOnAleSTRATEGY The global strategy for minimizing poliovirus facility-associated risks consists of risk elimination by destroying poliovirus materials in all but certified poliovirus-essential facilities1 and biorisk management of these facilities by strict adherence to required safeguards. Risk elimination Risk elimination in poliovirus-non-essential facilities is achieved through the destruction, or transfer to poliovirus-essential facilities, of: 1. infectious and potentially infectious WPV materials; 2. OPV/Sabin materials, as described below. Destruction applies to all materials potentially contaminated with any type or strain of WPV or OPV/Sabin poliovirus, or where the presence of polioviruses cannot be ruled out, particularly with regard to untested virus stocks in facilities that in the past worked with polioviruses (9) and in non-polio facilities retaining valuable clinical materials potentially infected with polio or OPV/Sabin viruses. Successful global elimination of the risk requires each country to effectively prohibit retention and subsequent acquisition of poliovirus materials in all poliovirus-non-essential facilities following global recommendations (3). Biorisk management Biorisk management in designated poliovirus-essential facilities (Annexes 2 and 3) is achieved through the implementation of international biorisk management standards that: 1. include polio-specific containment requirements to reduce the likelihood of release of polioviruses from poliovirus-essential facilities (primary safeguards); 2. describe population immunity requirements (secondary safeguards) to minimize the consequences of the release of polioviruses from poliovirus-essential facilities; 3. define the site-specific environmental requirements for poliovirus-essential facilities (tertiary safeguards), to further minimize the consequences of release. Primary safeguards of containment reduce the likelihood of accidental or malicious poliovirus release from a poliovirus-essential facility and are specified in the \"Biorisk management standard for poliovirus-essential facilities holding wild poliovirus materials\" (Annex 2) and \"Biorisk management standard for poliovirus-essential facilities holding only OPV/Sabin poliovirus materials (no WPV)\" (Annex 3). Key elements include: facility management, which practises continuous risk assessment and strict observance of biosafety and laboratory biosecurity procedures; the containment facility, which incorporates appropriate design, construction and operation principles, addressing identified biorisk; the immunization of facility personnel, which can reduce the risk of infection in the facility and intra- or extra-household transmission, should infection occur (10; 11); reduction in the use of WPV and the substitution with Sabin strains or further attenuated strains where possible (10); 1 Laboratories or polio vaccine production facilities. 4 WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) StRA tegy contingency plans for potential virus release or exposure, which specify actions and assign responsibilities for the facility, the institution, the ministry of health (MoH) and other concerned government agencies. Secondary safeguards of population immunity minimize the consequences of a poliovirus release into the community from a poliovirus-essential facility and consist of a national routine childhood polio immunization policy and the achievement of high national population coverage consistent with WHO policy (3) and eventual post-eradication strategies (12). Tertiary safeguards of facility location minimize the consequences of the unintentional release of highly transmissible WPV by placing poliovirus-essential facilities in areas with demonstrated low poliovirus R 0, i.e. in areas with closed sewage systems with a minimum of secondary treatment of effluents. Primary and secondary safeguards are required for poliovirus-essential facilities that handle and store WPV2 or OPV2/Sabin2 materials during the poliovirus type 2 containment period and after cessation of bOPV use (Table 1). The potential for spread (R 0) is two to 10 times less for Sabin/OPV strains than for WPV, which reduces the risk for infection at the community level if a breach of containment occurs, and the consequences of such a breach if transmission were recognized in time (11). Primary, secondary and tertiary safeguards are required for poliovirus-essential facilities that handle and store WPV materials after WPV eradication (Table 1). National certification and regular annual recertification thereafter is required for all poliovirus-essential facilities. WHO verification of compliance with GAPIII may be requested on a regular (triennial) basis. National certification supported by WHO verification provides assurance that the required safeguards are met. 5 WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII)StRA tegytable 1: g APIII containment safeguards at a glance Poliovirus type 2 containment periodFinal poliovirus containment period poliovirusesAll OPV/Sabin poliovirusesAll wild polioviruses 1\u00b0 safeguards: Prevent infection & release of contaminated materials Operator protection2 Yes Yes Yes Decontamination of materials/equipmentYes Yes Yes Dedicated effluent treatment plantNo3 No3Yes4 Air/exhaust treatment No No Yes5 2\u00b0 safeguards: Population immunity in country hosting the facility IPV doses 1 1 3 IPV coverage = DTP3 coverage6 DTP3 coverage >90%7 3\u00b0 safeguards: Environment & location Siting of facilities in areas with low transmission potential (R 0) for wild poliovirusesNo No Yes DTP3: Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine third dose. 2 Since the operator is considered to be one of the sources of poliovirus release from the facility, specific protection measures are required, including, for example, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), the use of primary containment devices and vaccination. 3 Untreated release into a closed sewage system with secondary effluent treatment in the facility location (all waste from facilities, potentially containing live poliovirus, should be inactivated prior to release through adequate and validated inactivation procedures. In facilities without a dedicated effluent treatment plant, this would normally be done by applying heat or chemicals as part of a validated treatment process. Under no circumstances should raw poliovirus containing effluents be discharged to drains, unless the effluent treatment plant has been designed and validated to handle such effluents, effectively acting as part of the primary containment system). 4 Facility effluent treatment before release into a closed sewage system with secondary or greater effluent treatment in the facility location. 5 High-efficiency particulate arresting (HEPA) filtration on exhaust air. 6 Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine third dose (DTP3) immunization coverage (19). 7 Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011-2020 (20). 6 WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) StRA tegyOVERVIEW OF PHASES The Global Action Plan is implemented in three phases linked to national and international milestones in polio eradication (Figure 1). Phase I: Preparation for containment of poliovirus type 2 Phase I is in progress until the conditions for global readiness of OPV2 withdrawal have been met. Key activities conducting national laboratory survey and poliovirus type 2 inventory; destroying unneeded poliovirus type 2 materials; transferring needed poliovirus type 2 materials to poliovirus-essential facilities; informing governments, institutions and polio facilities about the upcoming need for poliovirus containment; certifying designated poliovirus-essential facilities for containment. Phase II: Poliovirus type 2 containment period Phase II commences as soon as the criteria for global readiness of OPV2 withdrawal are met, and continues until certification of global WPV eradication. Readiness criteria (13) for OPV2 withdrawal include: 1. the introduction of at least one dose of IPV in routine immunization; 2. access to a bOPV that is licensed for routine immunization; 3. the implementation of surveillance and response protocols for type 2 poliovirus (including constitution of a stockpile of mOPV2); 4. the completion of Phase I poliovirus containment activities, with appropriate handling of residual type 2 materials; 5. the verification of global eradication of WPV2. The trigger for setting a definite date for global OPV2 withdrawal (tOPV-bOPV switch) will be the absence of all persistent cVDPV2 for at least six months. This phase has two parts, addressing the containment of WPV2 or OPV2/Sabin2: Phase IIa: Containment of WPV2 All WPV2 are contained (as per Table 1 and Figure 1) in certified poliovirus-essential facilities (Annex 2). Phase IIb: Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 poliovirus All OPV2/Sabin2 polioviruses are contained (as per Table 1 and Figure 1) in certified poliovirus-essential facilities (Annex 3). Phase IIb commences within three months of OPV2 withdrawal (tOPV-bOPV switch). During Phase II, action on OPV2/Sabin2 poliovirus containment may be temporarily suspended in areas where a decision by WHO has been made to use mOPV2 to respond to emerging or re-emerging WPV2/cVDPV2 transmission. 7 WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII)OveRvIew Of PhASeSPhase III: final poliovirus containment Phase III commences when global WPV transmission has not been detected for three years and just prior to the certification of global WPV eradication. Phase IIIa: Final containment of all WPV All WPV is contained long term (as per Table 1 and Figure 1) in certified poliovirus- essential facilities, with enhanced primary safeguards. Phase IIIb: Final containment of all OPV/Sabin polioviruses All OPV/Sabin polioviruses are contained long term (as per Table 1 and Figure 1) in certified poliovirus-essential facilities. Phase IIIb commences within three months of bOPV cessation (bOPV cessation is planned one year after the certification of global WPV eradication). During phase III, action on OPV/Sabin poliovirus containment may be temporarily suspended in areas where a decision by WHO has been made to use mOPV to respond to emerging or re-emerging WPV/cVDPV transmission. The implementation requirements for the different phases are described below. 8 WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) OveRvIew Of PhASeSPhase type 2 containment periodPhase III: 6 x Regional certification of WPV eradicationOPV2 withdrawalbOPVcessationGlobal readiness criteria met No containment Adoption of safe-handling measuresContainment of WPV2, OPV2/Sabin2; Final containment of all OPV/Sabin poliovirusesFinal containment of all WPV Global readiness criteria for OPV2 withdrawal: 1.

The survey starts with the establishment of a national database of biomedical facilities that includes all facilities with the following types of laboratories: poliovirus/enterovirus, general virology, clinical bacteriology, parasitology, environmental and industrial (polio vaccine and general microbiological filter and disinfectant manufacturers), or any other laboratory handling and storing polioviruses. Facilities listed in the database are surveyed to confirm whether WPV infectious or potentially infectious materials are being stored; develop a national inventory of facilities that handle and store WPV materials, and report to the Regional Certification Commission (RCC) for poliomyelitis eradication. The national inventory serves as a current record of poliovirus facilities. National inventories are assembled into regional inventories maintained by WHO regional offices; submit annual reports to the RCC on the current status of the national inventory of facilities with poliovirus materials; complete national surveys and inventories, and submit documentation to the RCC that the Phase I survey and inventory requirements have been met. The MoH submits the complete report on Phase I survey and inventory activities and supporting documents to the National Certification Committee for review and endorsement before submission to the RCC. After completion of national surveys and inventories and in preparation for Phase II, all countries shall: adopt international goals (3) for the timely destruction or containment of WPV2 materials and of OPV2/Sabin2 materials, and decide to either: prohibit the retention of all GAPIII-specified poliovirus materials by any facility after achieving specific milestones, or prohibit the retention of all GAPIII-specified poliovirus materials except in designated certified poliovirus-essential facilities. Countries considering the need for poliovirus-essential containment facilities shall weigh the risks and benefits of such facilities in consultation with all relevant ministries (e.g. health, education, defence, environment, etc.) and the responsibilities inherent in complying with the crucial primary, secondary and tertiary safeguards. They will: alert biomedical facilities to national policies/international agreements (14) pertaining to the retention of WPV materials or OPV/Sabin materials to permit the orderly planning for compliance; 10 WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) PhASe ImPlement AtIOn instruct facilities have worked with poliovirus, enteroviruses, rhinovirus, rotavirus or norovirus to confirm the identity of all virus stocks, reference strains and derivatives of such viruses grown in poliovirus-permissive cell cultures to rule out the presence of poliovirus (10). Where and when necessary, virus stocks of uncertain histories or multiple passages must be replaced with stocks of documented authenticity from an international culture collection or from other investigators using appropriate reference techniques. Laboratories wishing to retain historic collections of clinical materials shall explore options with designated poliovirus-essential research and reference facilities for handling and storage arrangements; request facilities on the national inventory submit plans for compliance with poliovirus retention policies and/or regulations (14), including the status of materials and action timelines; request poliovirus-non-essential facilities that do not intend to retain infectious or potentially infectious poliovirus materials (6) to: destroy unneeded poliovirus material (WPV infectious and potentially infectious materials, and any OPV/Sabin materials), or transfer all needed poliovirus type 2 material to poliovirus-essential facilities; request poliovirus-non-essential laboratory facilities that as of Phase II are likely to investigate new WPV2, aVDPV2, cVDPV2 or iVDPV2 isolates, or new faecal or respiratory samples originating from recent OPV-using countries, to adopt and implement: safe and secure working practices based on a risk assessment and the implementation of appropriate biorisk management systems (Annex 6) a non-retention policy for WPV2 materials as of the beginning of Phase IIa of the poliovirus type 2 containment period a non-retention policy for OPV2/Sabin2 materials as of the beginning of Phase IIb of the poliovirus type 2 containment period; If poliovirus type 2 is isolated after the initiation of Phase IIa, the facility must immediately notify the MoH and WHO, and transfer the isolate to a designated certified poliovirus- essential facility; notify the general biomedical laboratory community that, according to the globally endorsed Endgame Strategy (3), the retention of WPV2 materials will no longer be permitted in Phase IIa and the retention of OPV2/Sabin2 materials will no longer be permitted in Phase IIb, except in designated certified poliovirus-essential facilities. Facilities are fully responsible for compliance with national policies and/or regulations (14), including the destruction of WPV2 infectious and potentially infectious materials and any OPV2/Sabin2 materials or the transfer of such materials to a designated poliovirus-essential facility. Facilities in the national database of biomedical laboratories with a history of performing activities placing them at risk of having potentially infectious poliovirus materials or contaminated stocks must respond to the MoH or another designated national authority documenting the absence of such materials. 11 WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) PhASe ImPlement AtIOnCountries with plans to designate poliovirus-essential facilities shall in addition: request candidate facilities assess and submit documentation demonstrating compliance with secondary and tertiary safeguards, as applicable to the type of material being held (WPV2 or OPV2/Sabin2 poliovirus); implement national certification procedures to assess the compliance of poliovirus- essential facilities with the \"Containment of poliovirus type 2\" provisions, including primary and secondary safeguards. Designated poliovirus-essential facilities wishing to handle and store WPV2 materials must be fully certified before Phase II; establish national contingency plans for responding to the potential release of or exposure to poliovirus (15); request candidate poliovirus-essential facilities8 that plan to handle and store infectious WPV2 materials be certified in the implementation of the \"Containment of poliovirus type 2\" provisions, including primary and secondary safeguards (Annex 2), before Phase II. If unable to meet the requirements, all WPV2 materials must be transferred to a country and facility meeting the requirements, or be destroyed; request candidate poliovirus-essential facilities9 that plan to handle and store only OPV2/ Sabin2 materials (but no WPV2) be certified in the implementation of the \"Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 poliovirus\" provisions, including primary and secondary safeguards (Annex 3), no later than three months after the switch. If unable to meet the requirements, all OPV2/Sabin2 materials must be transferred to a country and facility meeting the requirements, or be destroyed. Countries or concerned facilities may apply through their national authorities for WHO verification of poliovirus-essential facilities, certified by the MoH or another designated national authority, and declared to meet all biorisk management criteria consistent with Annex 2 or 3 (Annex 4). Preparing for the tOPV-bOPV switch The WHA resolution (14) on the tOPV-bOPV switch (16) provides details on the process for implementing each step leading to OPV2 withdrawal, the recall of unused tOPV and the containment of OPV2/Sabin2 polioviruses: tOPV-using countries shall respond to the WHA resolution (14) with detailed plans for compliance. All countries shall review or expand the Phase I institution or facility database to include new or other biomedical laboratories that might have infectious or potentially infectious OPV2/Sabin2 materials of any origin. (Physicians' offices, pharmacies and health facilities that may have tOPV vials will be notified through other government channels as part of the tOPV-bOPV switch process). Plans and actions to prepare for the tOPV-bOPV switch continue in Phase II as described below. 12 WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) PhASe ImPlement AtIOn 8 Laboratories or IPV production facilities. 9 Laboratories or OPV/Sabin-IPV production facilities.Phase II: Poliovirus type 2 containment period Phase IIa: Containment of WPV2 Phase IIa commences when the criteria for global readiness of OPV2 withdrawal are met. As of the beginning of Phase IIa: The handling and storage of WPV2 material are no longer permitted in poliovirus-non- essential facilities. Poliovirus-non-essential laboratory facilities that are likely to investigate new WPV2, aVDPV2, cVDPV2 or iVDPV2 isolates, or new faecal and respiratory samples originating from recent OPV-using countries must: implement safe and secure working practices based on a risk assessment and appropriate biorisk management systems (Annex 6); not retain any WPV2 materials for long-term storage; immediately destroy any newly isolated WPV2 materials, or transfer them to a certified poliovirus-essential facility after notifying the MoH or another designated national authority and WHO. Certified poliovirus-essential facilities10 handling and storing WPV2 in Phase II must implement and be regularly (e.g. annually) reassessed against the \"Containment of poliovirus type 2\" provisions, including primary and secondary safeguards, as described in Annex 2. Facilities that have not yet received formal national certification in the containment of poliovirus type 2 are no longer allowed to handle and store WPV2 materials. Countries or concerned facilities may apply through their national authorities for WHO verification of poliovirus-essential WPV2-holding facilities, certified by the MoH or another designated national authority, and declared to meet all biorisk management criteria consistent with Annex 2 (Annex 4). Phase IIb: Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 poliovirus Moving forward with the preparations for the tOPV-bOPV switch: All countries shall notify the general laboratory community of forthcoming requirements for the implementation of the \"Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 poliovirus\" provisions. The general laboratory community already is, or should be, aware of pending actions linked to the tOPV-bOPV switch. Facilities shall be reminded in writing of the planned date for the tOPV-bOPV switch and that national policies and regulations (14) pertaining to OPV2/Sabin2 poliovirus destruction or containment will be in force at that time. Communications from the MoH or another designated national authority to all biomedical laboratory facilities shall further encourage the destruction of unneeded OPV/Sabin materials. Laboratories wishing to maintain access to historic collections of clinical materials potentially infectious for OPV2/ Sabin2 polioviruses shall explore options with designated certified poliovirus-essential research and reference containment facilities for handling and storage arrangements. 13 WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) PhASe ImPlement AtIOn 10 Laboratories or IPV production facilities.Global tOPV administration will stop (OPV2 cessation) at an effective date established by the World Health Assembly (14).

WHO will provide specific implementation guidelines (16) for the collection and destruction of tOPV from designated collection points, health facilities or private practitioners, and national and subnational storage facilities. Phase II coincides with a period of intense VDPV surveillance and elimination. Some high-risk areas may require the emergency use of mOPV2 to respond to emerging or re-emerging VDPV2 transmission. In such areas it may be necessary to temporarily suspend the \"Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 poliovirus\" provisions, until the emergency is resolved. Within six months of the switch, all countries must: submit documentation to the RCC that the containment of OPV2/Sabin2 poliovirus requirements have been met. Phase IIb commences three months after the global tOPV-bOPV switch. As of the beginning of Phase IIb (within three months of the switch): The handling and storage of OPV2/Sabin2 poliovirus material are no longer permitted in poliovirus-non-essential facilities. Poliovirus-non-essential laboratory facilities that are likely to investigate new faecal and respiratory samples originating from recent OPV-using countries must: implement safe and secure working practices based on a risk assessment and appropriate biorisk management systems (Annex 6); not retain any WPV2 or OPV2/Sabin2 materials for long-term storage; immediately destroy any newly isolated type 2 poliovirus materials, or transfer them to a certified poliovirus-essential facility after notifying the MoH or another designated national authority and WHO. Certified poliovirus-essential facilities11 handling and storing only OPV2/Sabin2 polioviruses (but no WPV2) must implement and be regularly (e.g. annually) reassessed against the \"Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 poliovirus\" provisions, including primary and secondary safeguards, as described in Annex 3. Sabin virus stocks of uncertain histories or multiple passages must be replaced with stocks of documented authenticity from an international culture collection or from other investigators using appropriate reference techniques to rule out possible contamination with WPV. Facilities that have not yet received formal national certification in the containment of OPV2/Sabin2 poliovirus are no longer allowed to handle and store OPV2/Sabin2 poliovirus materials. 14 WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) PhASe ImPlement AtIOn 11 Laboratories or OPV/Sabin-IPV production facilities.The storage of mOPV2 stockpiles (frozen bulk and finished product, prepared in accordance with international requirements (15)) and the replenishment of mOPV2 stockpiles of filled vaccine vials must be performed under appropriate containment conditions, based on a risk assessment approved by the competent authority. Countries or concerned facilities may apply through their national authorities for WHO verification of poliovirus-essential facilities holding OPV2/Sabin2, certified by the MoH or another designated national authority, and declared to meet all biorisk management criteria consistent with Annex 3 (Annex 4). Preparing for Phase III In preparation for Phase IIIa (Final containment of all WPV), countries with poliovirus- essential facilities holding WPV shall in addition: implement national certification procedures to assess compliance with the \"Final containment of all WPV\" provisions, including primary, secondary and tertiary safeguards; request poliovirus-essential facilities12 that plan to handle and store infectious WPV materials in Phase III be certified and regularly (e.g. annually) reassessed against the \"Final containment of all WPV\" implementation provisions, including primary, secondary and tertiary safeguards (Annex 2) before Phase III. Facilities failing national certification will have to discontinue WPV activities until deficiencies are satisfactorily corrected and national certification is granted. If unable to meet the requirements, all WPV materials must be destroyed or transferred to a country and facility meeting the requirements before Phase III. Nationally certified poliovirus-essential facilities holding WPV may be verified through WHO (Annex 4).

Poliovirus serotypes are further subdivided into wild (circulating in nature) and Sabin strains (attenuated strains used for oral polio vaccines). Polioviruses use CD155 as the primary cellular receptor. Poliovirus, wild: Wild polioviruses are naturally occurring isolates known or believed to have circulated persistently in the community. Vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV) are classified with wild polioviruses and usually demonstrate 1-15%16 sequence differences from the parental oral polio vaccine (OPV) strain; they may have circulated in the community (cVDPV) or have replicated for prolonged periods in immunodeficient subjects (iVDPV) or be ambiguous and of unknown origin (aVDPV). Attenuated strains not licensed for use as live vaccines (Cox/Lederle and Koprowski/Wistar series) are classified with wild polioviruses as their clinical properties are unproven. Wild poliovirus materials may be (a) infectious or (b) potentially infectious. (a) Poliovirus infectious materials, wild: These include: clinical materials from confirmed wild poliovirus (including VDPV) infections; environmental sewage or water samples that have tested positive for the presence of wild polioviruses; cell culture isolates and reference strains of wild poliovirus; seed stocks and infectious materials from IPV production; 16 Some isolates display >15% sequence diversity but are phylogenetically related to parental Sabin strains.

The phenotype of clinical and environmental OPV-like isolates need not be determined as the great majority are assumed to be of low virulence. Sabin materials may be (a) infectious or (b) potentially infectious. The attenuated phenotype of viruses resulting from manufacture based on the OPV/Sabin seeds must be assured and cannot rely on the lack of sequence drift alone. (a) Poliovirus infectious materials, OPv/Sabin: These include: cell culture isolates and reference OPV/Sabin strains; seed stocks and live virus materials from OPV production; environmental sewage or water samples that have tested positive for the presence of OPV/Sabin strains; faecal or respiratory secretion samples from recent OPV recipients; infected animals or samples from such animals, including poliovirus receptor transgenic mice; derivatives produced in the laboratory that have capsid sequences from OPV/Sabin strains; WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) Annex 1: defInItIOnS 25 full-length RNA cDNA that includes capsid sequences derived from OPV/Sabin strains; cells persistently infected with poliovirus strains whose capsid sequences are derived from OPV/Sabin strains. (b) Poliovirus potentially infectious materials, OPv/Sabin: These include: faecal or respiratory secretion samples collected for any purpose in a time and geographic area of OPV use; products of such materials from poliovirus permissive cells or animals; respiratory and enteric virus stocks handled under conditions where OPV/Sabin strain contamination or replication is possible.

The Global Action Plan addresses that risk by establishing a post-eradication/post-OPV cessation goal of retaining poliovirus in a limited number of poliovirus-essential facilities worldwide. The Global Action Plan further reduces the risk posed by these facilities by establishing international standards for primary safeguards of facility containment, secondary safeguards of population immunity, and tertiary safeguards of facility location and assurance through national and international oversight that such standards are met. Primary safeguards minimize the risk of facility-associated poliovirus release and include facility management; the design and operation of the containment facility; practices and procedures; the vaccination of facility personnel and their close family members; and contingency plans for potential virus release or exposure. Secondary safeguards of population immunity minimize the consequence of a poliovirus release from a poliovirus-essential containment facility and consist of a national routine childhood immunization policy and demonstrated high (=DTP3; >90%) national population coverage (12). Tertiary safeguards of facility location minimize the risk of transmissible poliovirus by placing such facilities in areas with closed sewage systems with secondary or greater effluent treatment in areas with low transmission potential (R 0) for wild polioviruses. Primary and secondary safeguards are required for poliovirus-essential facilities handling and storing wild poliovirus type 2 (WPV2) in the poliovirus type 2 containment period. Primary, secondary and tertiary safeguards are required for poliovirus-essential facilities that are handling and storing any WPV materials in the final containment phase. WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII)ANNEX 2: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL HOLDING WILD POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS29This \"Biorisk management standard for poliovirus-essential facilities holding wild poliovirus materials\" describes the international requirements for the primary safeguards established for poliovirus-essential laboratories handling and storing WPV materials or for Salk-IPV production facilities. This standard is based on CWA15793, Laboratory biorisk management (2), the principles of the WHO Laboratory biosafety manual, Third edition (17) and the extensive poliovirus scientific literature spanning nearly seven decades (10). This standard serves as the framework for national certification and WHO verification (Annex 4). It consists of 16 elements and subelements based on the principles of a quality management system. It assumes that the organization is best placed to understand the risks associated with its work and can manage those risks in a number of ways acceptable to the national and international bodies responsible for facility oversight. This standard further assumes that poliovirus-essential facility personnel and management at all levels fully appreciate the enormity of the consequences of accidental or malicious poliovirus release in the post eradication/post - OPV era and are prepared to demonstrate that the appropriate systems and controls are in place to manage those risks. Poliovirus facility-associated risks Polioviruses under moist conditions in clinical or environmental samples can survive indefinitely in the laboratory freezer ( <-20 \u00b0C), for many months in the refrigerator and for weeks on the bench top at ambient temperatures (18). Infectivity is inactivated by dehydration, heat ( >50 \u00b0C) or treatment with dilute solutions of formaldehyde or bleach at appropriate concentrations. The most common routes of exposure to infectious agents in the facility environment are (1) ingestion; (2) inhalation; (3) injection; and (4) contaminated skin and mucous membranes. The infectious dose is a factor of virus virulence, the route of presentation and virus particles in sufficient number to overcome mechanical loss and natural and immune host defences. In the poliovirus facility, poliovirus content of common materials ranges from a of 103.7 CCID 50/g culture harvests, and 1011 CCID 50/ml in concentrates in vaccine production facilities. Sabin strains are less pathogenic than wild and have lower secondary infection rates, but all three Sabin virus types have been linked to vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) outbreaks. Ingestion presents the highest risk for facility personnel. Immunization with OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) prevents disease, but neither fully inhibits silent poliovirus infection nor reinfection of the gut. Ingestion of poliovirus may result from any laboratory operation, activity or incident that leads to the transfer of infectious particles to the gastrointestinal tract. Estimated infectious doses (ID 50) by ingestion, based on studies with infants and children, are \u00b1101 CCID 50 for wild polioviruses and \u00b1103 CCID 50 for Sabin strains. Immunized adult laboratory workers are likely more resistant than immunologically na\u00efve children, but resistance is dose related and may be overcome by ingesting sufficient poliovirus particles. Droplets created by sprays, spills and the splash of poliovirus cell cultures (108 CCID 50) and concentrates (1011 CCID 50) constitute the highest personnel exposure risks (Figure A2.1). Inhalation, defined as exposure to small particle aerosols of <5 micrometres (m) (droplet nuclei) deposited predominately in the lower respiratory tract, has been identified as a possible route of infection for poliovirus. The respiratory tract appears not to be a significant portal of entry. Unresolved, however, is whether small particle aerosols deposited in the lower respiratory tract may initiate alimentary tract infections through mucociliary transport WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) ANNEX 2: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR FACILITIES HOLDING WILD POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS30to the pharyngeal region. Inhalation risks may be further reduced in facility environments maintained at low relative humidity ( <50%). Antibodies acquired through immunization greatly reduce infection risks from injection or breaks in skin or mucous membranes. Figure A2.1: Estimated poliovirus content and infectious dose17Virus content (CCID50) Estimated infectious dose (ID 50) Sabin PV PV Pharyngeal (per concentrates (per ml)1014 1012 1010 108 106 104 102 0 Community members may be exposed to infectious agents from the laboratory through (1) workers' contaminated skin or clothing or unrecognized infection; (2) the release of contaminated air; (3) contaminated effluents and waste water recovered from secondary sewage treatment plants; (4) the uncontrolled transport of infectious material; (5) solid waste transported to landfills; (6) contaminated equipment or materials removed from the facility; (7) the escape of infected animals; and (8) a theft or deliberate release of infectious agents from a facility. Exposure risks through routes 4-7 are low for poliovirus facilities that adhere to international regulations for the transport of infectious substances, those outlined in the Good Laboratory Practice handbook and the WHO guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practice , and likely low for the inhalation of contaminated air effluent where facilities maintain low relative humidity environments and exhaust air away from direct human exposure. Exposure risks through the ingestion of effluents range between high and low, depending on the poliovirus content of facility effluent, sewerage system size and integrity, and the potential for human consumption. Risks of community exposure are highest through facility personnel unknowingly contaminated or infected with poliovirus. IPV immunization of facility personnel may greatly reduce the risk of intra- and extra-household transmission. Effective poliovirus risk management is achieved by the careful assessment of exposure risks, the implementation of risk-appropriate personnel protection measures, and the quality operation of a facility designed to minimize the risk of poliovirus contamination and dissemination to the community. The main risk is the infection of laboratory workers by ingestion. Airborne transmission is conceivable but not demonstrated and infection through parenteral exposure such as needlestick is unlikely in immunized individuals. 17 Estimated infectious doses (ID 50) are based on studies with infants and children. Immunized adult laboratory workers are likely much more resistant than immunologically na\u00efve children. However, dose-related resistance may be overcome by ingesting sufficient poliovirus particles.

Depending on the relevance of biorisk management to the organization, the biorisk management policy should complement the general HSE policies. As appropriate, the biorisk management policy may be integrated into the organization's HSE policies. CWA 4.2.11.1.2 The policy clearly states: 1. the overall biorisk management objectives; 2. a commitment to improving biorisk management performance.The policy should require that all projects/work areas be assessed for risks and a full assessment be prepared before approval is given to commence work. CWA 4.2.11.1.3 The policy is appropriate to the nature and scale of the risk associated with the facility and associated activities. CWA 4.2.11.1.4 The policy commits to: 1. protecting staff, contractors, visitors, the community and the environment from poliovirus materials that are stored or handled within the facility; 2. reducing the risk of the unintentional release of, or exposure to, poliovirus materials; 3. reducing the risk of the unauthorized intentional release of hazardous biological materials to an acceptable level; 4. complying with all legal requirements applicable to the poliovirus materials that will be handled or possessed, and with the requirements of this standard; 5. ensuring that the need for effective biorisk management takes precedence over all non-\"health and safety\" operational requirements; 6. informing all employees and relevant third parties effectively and communicating individual obligations with regard to biorisk to these groups; 7. improving biorisk management performance continually.The policy includes the need to conduct risk assessments and implement the required control measures.

CWA 4.3.3.21.2.2 Management has established the controls and put in place documented procedures for monitoring the effectiveness of the controls being applied to reduce or eliminate the hazards identified in the risk assessment process. The controls can be monitored by regular audits, by utilizing corrective-action reporting processes where problems have been identified, by investigating incidents and accidents and improving controls and their implementation, and by ensuring adequate resources are provided to maintain the effectiveness of the controls. Note: Refer to Element 2 - Risk Assessment. 1.3 Roles, Responsibilities and Authorities CWA 4.4.1.11.3.1 Top management takes ultimate responsibility for the organization's biorisk management system. Top management includes officers (Director-General, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, etc.) and directors of the organization. Overall responsibility for managing biorisk rests with top management but tasks may be delegated through the organization, provided they are passed to competent individuals with adequate resources to perform the activities safely and securely. In smaller organizations, one individual may hold more than one role described in this standard. It is important to define roles and responsibilities, have clear communication within the organization regarding actions that need to be taken, and establish who has the required authority. CWA 4.4.1.11.3.2 Top management ensures that roles, responsibilities and authority related to biorisk management are defined, documented and communicated to those who manage, perform and verify work associated with the control of polioviruses. In assigning roles and responsibilities, potential conflicts of interest should be considered.

CWA 4.4.1.11.3.3 Top management demonstrates its commitment by ensuring the availability of resources to establish, implement, maintain and improve the biorisk management system.Resources include human resources and specialized skills, organizational infrastructure, technology and financial resources. CWA 4.4.1.2 1.3.4 A senior manager has been designated with the operational responsibility to oversee the biorisk management system.Senior managers are those with significant operational, budgetary and personnel authority at the departmental or higher level, and may include members of top management. CWA 4.4.1.2 1.3.5 The senior manager's functions in managing biorisk include: 1. providing appropriate resources to ensure the adequate provision of personnel, facilities and other resources deemed necessary for the safe and secure operation of the facility; 2. reporting to top management on the performance of the biorisk management system and any need for improvement; 3. ensuring the promotion of the biorisk management system throughout the organization; 4. instituting review, audit and reporting measures to provide assurance that the requirements of this standard are being implemented and maintained effectively.The senior management representative should be an individual with decision-making authority at a level whereby he/she can allocate resources and make decisions regarding the facility's biorisk management needs (including required resources to conduct risk assessments and other management and administrative activities) independently of the need to implement the programme of work. CWA 4.4.1.31.3.6 A biorisk management committee has been constituted to act as an independent review group for biorisk issues associated with the poliovirus facility.The biorisk management committee is often recognized as the institutional biosafety committee. Its role may be either a dedicated function or one that is addressed through a committee with a wider remit. Members may include the scientific manager, additional scientific specialists, the biorisk management adviser(s), the security manager and the occupational health professional. Others, such as the facility manager and/or worker and community representatives, may be included depending on the nature of the agenda or work.

The list of roles for the biorisk management committee is not exhaustive but includes some of the main areas that should be addressed. CWA 4.4.1.41.3.8 One or more competent individuals are designated to provide advice and guidance on biorisk management issues. The competent individual providing advice and guidance on biorisk management is often recognized as a biological safety officer or biological safety adviser. This function should normally be regarded as an advisory position and not one directly responsible for managing biorisk, as that rests with those conducting and managing the work within the organization (e.g. the scientific director, principal investigator, department head, laboratory manager, group leader). The role and knowledge of the biorisk adviser are important to develop, implement, maintain and continually improve a biosafety and biosecurity programme based on a management system. The adviser should be competent to perform the role and be allocated sufficient time and other resources to do the job effectively. CWA 4.4.1.41.3.9 The biorisk management adviser's role is independent of the functions of those responsible for implementing the programme of work. In the execution of their biorisk management duties, advisers should be independent from those responsible for implementing the programme of work and have direct access to the top management representative when necessary.

Many defined methodologies and approaches are available to conduct hazard identification, risk assessment and control; the approach taken will vary depending on the nature of the situation and the level of detail required. One framework that organizations may consider adopting is outlined in Figure 1 of CWA15793, 2011 (GAPIII, Annex 5). 2.3 Roles and Responsibilities WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII)ANNEX 2: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL HOLDING WILD POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS49CWA15793 Clause No.18Biorisk Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of WPV2Requirements for Final Containment of all WPVGuidance CWA 4.3.1.12.3.1 Resource requirements have been identified and adequate resources provided, including assigning trained personnel to management, work performance and verification activities, including internal review.The roles and responsibilities of personnel who perform and verify work affecting risk management should be defined and documented, particularly for people who need the organizational freedom and authority to: a. initiate action to prevent or reduce the adverse effects of risk; b. control the further treatment of risks until the level of risk becomes acceptable; c. identify and record any problems related to managing risks; d. initiate, recommend or provide solutions through designated channels; e. communicate and consult internally and externally as appropriate. 2.4 Hazard Identification CWA 4.3.1.32.4.1 The hazards associated with proposed work are: 1. identified; 2. documented.The first stage in the risk management process is to identify all hazards relevant to biorisk. It is useful to involve the whole work team in this process and to use inputs from organizational experts on safety and risk management. A hazard may be a physical situation (e.g. a fire or explosion), an activity (e.g. pipetting) or a material (in this case, the principal hazard is most likely to be a poliovirus, but others include chemicals and asphyxiating gases such as nitrogen). The essence of a hazard is its potential to cause harm, regardless of how likely such an occurrence might be. Biological hazards should be identified and assessed in relation to their potential damage to humans, animals and the environment. Where hazardous materials are classified into hazard or risk groups based on international and/or foreign WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) ANNEX 2: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FACILITIES HOLDING WILD POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS50 CWA15793 Clause No.18Biorisk Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of WPV2Requirements for Final Containment of all WPVGuidance country classification schemes, local diverging needs and constraints should be considered. A hazard identification exercise should use information that includes: a. group experience and knowledge; b. external or specialized expertise not found in the facility; c. results of previous assessments; d. surveys of previous accidents/incidents; e. hazardous materials data; f. information on hazardous organisms; g. guidelines and codes of practice; h. facility drawings; i. SOPs, manuals, etc.; j. process maps. Defined methodologies and approaches are available to conduct hazard identification exercises. Unless hazards are identified effectively, it is not possible to assess the risk associated with the facility and its activities. Hazard identification should be appropriate in nature and structure, and recorded to a level whereby others can review the process. 2.5 Risk Assessment CWA 4.3.1.42.5.1 Suitable methodologies for assessing and recording risks are: 1. identified; 2. implemented; 3. maintained. Risk assessments are documented.The risk assessment should categorize risks to identify those that need to be eliminated or controlled. Descriptions of likelihood and consequence, together with the acceptability of risk levels, should be defined and used in the assessment. Such a classification can be achieved, for example, by using a risk matrix that identifies likelihood and consequence categories, WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII)ANNEX 2: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL HOLDING WILD POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS51CWA15793 Clause No.18Biorisk Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of WPV2Requirements for Final Containment of all WPVGuidance country classification schemes, local diverging needs and constraints should be considered. A hazard identification exercise should use information that includes: a. group experience and knowledge; b. external or specialized expertise not found in the facility; c. results of previous assessments; d. surveys of previous accidents/incidents; e. hazardous materials data; f. information on hazardous organisms; g. guidelines and codes of practice; h. facility drawings; i. SOPs, manuals, etc.; j. process maps. Defined methodologies and approaches are available to conduct hazard identification exercises. Unless hazards are identified effectively, it is not possible to assess the risk associated with the facility and its activities. Hazard identification should be appropriate in nature and structure, and recorded to a level whereby others can review the process. 2.5 Risk Assessment CWA 4.3.1.42.5.1 Suitable methodologies for assessing and recording risks are: 1. identified; 2. implemented; 3. maintained. Risk assessments are documented.The risk assessment should categorize risks to identify those that need to be eliminated or controlled. Descriptions of likelihood and consequence, together with the acceptability of risk levels, should be defined and used in the assessment. Such a classification can be achieved, for example, by using a risk matrix that identifies likelihood and consequence categories, CWA15793 Clause No.18Biorisk Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of WPV2Requirements for Final Containment of all WPVGuidance ordered to illustrate those falling into high, moderate and low zones. However, other approaches may also be relevant and appropriate. Assessments can be qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative, and a method suitable to the situation should be identified and followed. In conducting the assessment, due consideration should be given to the inherent risk from polioviruses (e.g. from risk grouping descriptions, material safety data sheets). After defining and implementing control measures, the risks should be reviewed to decide whether the remaining risk is acceptable or additional controls need to be identified and implemented. 2.6 Risk Control CWA 4.3.1.5.2.6.1 Suitable methodologies for allocating actions that result from risk assessments, including timelines, responsible persons and associated reporting and approval mechanisms, are: 1. identified; 2. implemented; 3. maintained.The risk management approach should have a control plan that includes: a. who is responsible and accountable for implementing the plan; b. what resources are to be used (e.g. people, budget); c. a timetable for implementation; d. details of the mechanism and frequency of reviewing compliance with the plan. Risk management strategies should include the hierarchies of control. These are elimination of the work, substitution with an alternative organism/activity, isolation of the hazard, the use of engineering controls, administrative controls or the reliance on PPE. Element 3 - Poliovirus Inventory and Information The Poliovirus Inventory and Information element examines the systems in place to identify, record and review the organisms stored, received and transported from a facility. The level of detail and nature of the system WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) ANNEX 2: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FACILITIES HOLDING WILD POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS52 CWA15793 Clause No.18Biorisk Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of WPV2Requirements for Final Containment of all WPVGuidance depends on the pathogens being held, and ranges in complexity from simple lists to secure databases.

Subelements 3.1 Inventory 3.2 Information and Records 3.3 Transfer of Poliovirus Materials 3.4 Monitoring and Control 3 POLIOVIRUS INVENTORY AND INFORMATION 3.1 Inventory CWA 4.4.4.23.1.1 An accurate and up-to-date poliovirus inventory is established and maintained. The inventory process should be based on risk and include: a. identifying all poliovirus materials held, including cultures, specimens and other sources (e.g. infected tissues/samples or animals); b. storing poliovirus material within the containment perimeter of the poliovirus facility, ensuring stored samples of wild and Sabin poliovirus materials are segregated from each other and other isolates, cell lines, cultures or other materials that could be subject to cross-contamination or misidentification; c. ensuring the movement of poliovirus materials to and from storage meets the standards of element 15 (Transport Procedures); d. ensuring the surfaces of all storage vessels are decontaminated with a validated method for inactivating polioviruses; e. restricting access to poliovirus materials to authorized individuals with a demonstrable legitimate need; f. implementing effective physical security measures according to risk (e.g. locks, alarms, access controls); WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII)ANNEX 2: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL HOLDING WILD POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS53CWA15793 Clause No.18Biorisk Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of WPV2Requirements for Final Containment of all WPVGuidance g. developing and maintaining a reliable sample identification system; h. segregating and storing poliovirus materials according to risk; i. determining what materials should be controlled (e.g. seed stocks, working stocks, infected animals) and what level of information should be captured in the inventory for these materials. 3.2 Information and Records CWA 4.4.4.23.2.1 Records related to the poliovirus inventory are: 1. current; 2. complete; 3. stored securely with adequate backup provision.Inventory information should include: a. the name(s) and contact information of the individuals(s) responsible for the poliovirus material, and the details of other personnel with access to the poliovirus materials or the immediate area based on the level of risk; b. restricted access to the detailed inventory records to those individuals whose work requires access to that information; c. legible and robust identification numbers and other relevant identifiers; d. records of quantities/volumes of poliovirus materials at an appropriate level and based on risk (number of containers/vials or applicable equivalent), exact location of storage, and ability to account for materials at all times; e. origin, including geographical source and date of collection; f. records of materials removed from storage to conduct work, and the fate of those materials and any newly developed stocks (consumed, destroyed, removed from the facility, returned to storage in location X) following the completion of the work. 3.3 Transfer of Poliovirus Materials CWA 4.4.4.23.3.1 Transfers of poliovirus materials between laboratories at the facility or into and out of the facility are recorded and controlled in line with the level of risk. Controls should be put in place to ensure all the necessary checks and documented assurances are received to guarantee WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) ANNEX 2: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FACILITIES HOLDING WILD POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS54 CWA15793 Clause No.18Biorisk Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of WPV2Requirements for Final Containment of all WPVGuidance that requests for poliovirus materials originate from legitimate facilities and individuals. Material may only be brought into the facility or sent elsewhere if authorized by those responsible for the facility. For materials deemed to be of high risk, more stringent controls, including shipment tracking and the verification of receipt, are necessary. 3.4 Monitoring and Control CWA 4.5.33.4.1 The inventory is reviewed at predetermined intervals based on risk, and at a level and frequency whereby materials can be accounted for in an appropriate manner.The nature of the inventory and associated controls should be based on the nature of the material held and on the risk of harm should it be misplaced or removed with the intention of misuse. Poliovirus inventories will be monitored so that materials missing, unaccounted for or no longer needed are identified, consistent with the goal of reducing amounts of live poliovirus materials to the lowest level possible. An inventory review will be conducted at least annually. CWA 4.5.33.4.2 Measures are put in place to minimize the quantities of poliovirus materials in the inventory.The organization should demonstrate proactive measures to reduce risk through the elimination, substitution or minimization of volumes/quantities of poliovirus materials used, and the number of manipulations conducted. Procedures should be in place to investigate potentially missing poliovirus materials. Element 4 - General Safety The General Safety element examines the processes in place to make sure hazards associated with the personnel's work in the facility are identified and managed while addressing their implications for biorisk. Both a preventive and proactive approach should be taken to establish measures to identify, detect, mitigate and respond to emergencies related to general safety, such as fire, electricals, radiation, chemicals, animal care and pressurized equipment.

Measures should be put in place to address: a. human reliability and behavioural safety, including adherence to procedures; CWA15793 Clause No.18Biorisk Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of WPV2Requirements for Final Containment of all WPVGuidance b. team building and motivation; c. communication, consultation and feedback; d. conflict management and resolution; e. the management of stress and fatigue; f. empowerment, including authority to stop work if potentially unsafe or unsecure conditions are identified; g. access to counselling; h. the avoidance of a \"blame culture\", including willingness to report accidents, incidents or unsafe conditions/behaviours, and protection of workers who do so; i. ergonomics, including equipment and work practice design to take account of individual needs; j. respect for individual privacy and dignity. Element 9 - Health Care The Health Care element evaluates the systems in place to protect workers from injuries and illnesses resulting from exposures to biological agents or their products, and how they are supported in the event of an accident. Subject areas covered include exposure control, health care and monitoring, immunization and the availability of competent first aid and external assistance.

CWA 4.4.4.69.1.2 The requirements of the health surveillance programme are determined by a defined health hazard identification and risk assessment process that involves all relevant personnel. The programme may consult relevant personnel, including: a. the biorisk management adviser; b. the occupational health professional; c. facility personnel and employee representatives; d. external experts, including emergency responders; e. biorisk management committee members; f. veterinary and animal-care facility staff; g. human resource representatives; h. the communicable disease specialist; i. scientific management. Personnel considered to have significant risk of exposure should be identified and their health-care needs assessed. This should include the need for vaccination, PPE provision and emergency measures that encompass isolation/testing in the event of exposure. The individual's health and immune status, including an assessment of polio antibody titres as described under subelement 9.2.3, should be considered, and periodic checks appropriate to work conditions should be established. Although the primary focus of the assessment is exposure to the poliovirus materials being handled, other conditions that could impact personnel associated with the facility should also be addressed. These may include medical conditions that could affect the work (e.g. epilepsy, heart attack, impaired vision, physical mobility/dexterity), the ability to safely use appropriate PPE, or factors affecting general well-being (e.g. stress, depression, pregnancy, immune status, substance abuse).

All individuals should have access to health-care consultation with either a corporate or institutional occupational health facility or an independent health-care provider, and be informed of the nature of any treatments/ vaccinations they may receive and their inherent risks and benefits. 9.2 Vaccination of Personnel CWA 4.4.4.6.19.2.1 Based on risk, the need for vaccination has been determined and covers groups identified as being potentially exposed to poliovirus. Measures should be implemented when needed to identify non- responders to vaccination (depending on the vaccine's response rate) and a policy should be in place to address these individuals. Individuals considered unfit for work in the facility on health grounds should be identified and prevented from accessing areas with risk of exposure. Areas requiring vaccinations to enter should be posted. Visitors, contractors and other non-core personnel should provide evidence of vaccination or of established immunity in accordance with the above requirement. Based on risk, reasonable measures should be taken to ensure that the vaccinations have been given and current certificates are valid. This may include examining original certificates and cross-checking with medical practices responsible for administering the vaccine. The organization should ensure the required or recommended vaccines are made available to concerned personnel. Vaccination should be seen as a risk- mitigation strategy, and its use should in no way infer that other controls, such as the use of good microbiological techniques or PPE, can be relaxed. CWA 4.4.4.6.19.2.2 A vaccination policy has been defined and implemented.

The necessary plans and other materials for managing medical emergencies should be prepared, tested and maintained. Procedures should ensure that adequate first aid is available in relation to credible accident scenarios, as identified during risk assessments. The procedures should address the need for adequately trained personnel and their availability, as well as equipment and other materials that may be required to provide treatment. Procedures should ensure additional competent medical support is identified and made available (e.g. hospitals, isolation units). Element 10 - Emergency Response and Contingency Planning The Emergency Response and Contingency Planning element examines the structures and mechanisms in place to cope with working outside normal operating conditions, and how to react proportionally to emergency situations. Issues addressed include physical requirements, capacity in terms of personnel and facilities and of protective and rescue systems, emergency communications, decision-making authorities and the development and testing of emergency scenarios and simulations.

To plan for emergencies, all credible emergency scenarios must be considered. It is unlikely that all potential scenarios will be credible, but all reasonable threats should be considered and recorded and, where appropriate, the rationale for dismissing any issue should be provided. Scenarios considered should include: a. an infected/potentially infected worker or other contact (e.g. family member, emergency responder or community member); b. accident or illness to a worker within the containment area and need for evacuation; c. fire; d. flood; e. breach of security; f. explosion; g. the potential loss of poliovirus through theft or any other reason; h. unexpected virulence (unknown biological agents or biological agents expected to be avirulent); i. physical facility and equipment failure, including a control system failure of the disinfection regime; j. utility failure including electricity, gas, steam and water supplies; k. a major spillage/aerosol release; WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII)ANNEX 2: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL HOLDING WILD POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS69CWA15793 Clause No.18Biorisk Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of WPV2Requirements for Final Containment of all WPVGuidance l. environmental release; m. a natural disaster (e.g. earthquake, extreme weather conditions, disease pandemics); n. an act of terrorism or deliberate vandalism, extortion; o. intense media attention. 10.2 Emergency Response and Planning CWA 4.4.510.2.1 Plans and procedures are established and maintained to: 1. identify the potential for incidents and emergency situations involving biological agents, toxins and materials; 2. prevent their occurrence; 3. respond to emergency situations; 4. limit the likelihood of illness or other damage that may be associated with them. CWA 4.4.510.2.2 Emergency planning covers all aspects of biorisk and includes general safety, security and medical issues. A system is established to effectively manage a confirmed facility- associated poliovirus infection until the individual is free of poliovirus in stools for three consecutive days. This includes procedures for: 1. isolating infected individuals, particularly from children and the unimmunized; 2. collecting and disinfecting stool and associated waste; 3. educating families and frequent contacts on the risk posed by poliovirus infection and the procedures for isolation; 4. communicating with relevant national and local officials to evaluate the needs to implement community immunization response plans; 5. notifying WHO; 6. disinfecting areas potentially contaminated by infected individuals. 10.3 Emergency Plans WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) ANNEX 2: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FACILITIES HOLDING WILD POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS70 CWA15793 Clause No.18Biorisk Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of WPV2Requirements for Final Containment of all WPVGuidance CWA 4.4.5.210.3.1 Biorisks are taken into account when preparing and implementing emergency plans. A system is established to effectively manage incidents that are determined by the evaluation/response team to be significant poliovirus exposures, including: 1. implementing full preventive measures by isolating individuals under evaluation from children and the unimmunized in particular, and securing stool and associated waste; 2. educating individuals under investigation, their family and close contacts on the risk of poliovirus infection to the community, the procedures for diagnosis and the precautionary measures required to prevent possible transmission; 3. initiating procedures to determine whether individuals are infected, by collecting and testing nose, throat and stool specimens daily for a minimum of seven days post-exposure.The organization should ensure that plans address the following needs at a minimum: a. identifying those responsible for devising, implementing and testing the control measures specified, along with ensuring their conclusions are effectively communicated to all relevant personnel; b. ensuring the legality and enforceability of proposed emergency response plans; c. responding during emergencies occurring outside working hours as well as those occurring during normal working hours; d. providing for periods of reduced staff availability (e.g. during weekends and holiday periods); e. ensuring emergency access/exit, including the ability to override access controls as appropriate; f. providing emergency exit routes that avoid evacuating people through containment areas; g. providing for the safe removal, transport, transfer, treatment and accommodation of contaminated persons and objects; h. informing visitors and contractors about emergency response plans and the possible consequences of exposure. CWA 4.4.5.210.3.2 Control measures in place can be demonstrated as being reasonable and proportionate to the scale and nature of the emergency. CWA 4.4.5.210.3.3 Emergency plans are effectively communicated to all employees and relevant third parties, and tested with the goal of making everyone aware of their obligations. In the event of an emergency situation, it may be necessary to involve parties external to the organization. Based on the credible scenarios identified, the organization should pinpoint such agencies to establish their role in responding to a given situation. The organization may choose to sign memoranda of understanding or agreements with key local responders. It may also be necessary to inform and educate such parties on their role and any risk exposures they may face, and ensure their actions will not unnecessarily increase the risk associated with WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII)ANNEX 2: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL HOLDING WILD POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS71CWA15793 Clause No.18Biorisk Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of WPV2Requirements for Final Containment of all WPVGuidance the emergency (e.g. uncontrolled use of water for fires). Contact information should be documented and made available to personnel responsible for coordinating the emergency response activity. External agencies consulted may include: a. police and security services; b. fire services; c. ambulance and local hospitals/health-care providers; d. transport providers/couriers; e. local and national government officials; f. environmental authorities; g. WHO. 10.4 Emergency Exercises and Simulations CWA 4.4.5.310.4.1 Structured and realistic emergency exercises and simulations, including security drills, are conducted at regular intervals based on risk, to test the plans, prepare personnel and learn from any good practices or deficiencies identified. Exercises and simulations should be conducted to provide assurance that plans are effective and to learn from any lessons that arise. Exercises should be planned and every effort made to ensure they realistically represent the events simulated. However, such activities should also be conducted under controlled conditions and not be allowed to become a source of risk in their own right. The results of an exercise should be documented and reviewed for lessons learnt, and feedback on performance should be provided to the appropriate personnel. Any resulting actions should be recorded and allocated to named individuals, and measures should be put in place to ensure they are closed out effectively. 10.5 Contingency Plans WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) ANNEX 2: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FACILITIES HOLDING WILD POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS72 CWA15793 Clause No.18Biorisk Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of WPV2Requirements for Final Containment of all WPVGuidance CWA 4.4.5.410.5.1 In the event of an emergency, adequate contingency measures are in place to ensure the safety and security of continued operations. Normal operating conditions may be disrupted in the event of an emergency or unforeseen event. This could range from safely shutting down work during a power failure, to obtaining alternative storage conditions in the event of a breakdown. Such eventualities should be considered proactively, and contingency plans put in place. Activities should address the need for adequate redundancy, replacement and other measures, which could involve the availability of alternative facilities or personnel, the introduction of backup systems (e.g. power supplies), alternative means of decontaminating materials in the event of the failure of critical systems or equipment (e.g. kill tanks or autoclaves), or the complete safe shutdown of operations in extreme situations. Element 11 - Accident/Incident Investigation The Accident/Incident Investigation element addresses activities that define the facts and circumstances related to an event, determine the causes and develop remedial action to control biorisk and prevent recurrence. Often, chance is the only reason a property-damage accident or near-miss incident does not result in infection or personal harm. Likewise, chance alone often determines whether an accident's consequences are minor, serious or catastrophic. This element examines the organization's reporting and investigation system, whether the right people are involved and how corrective and preventive actions are implemented.

Procedures should be put in place to ensure that what constitutes an accident or incident is clearly defined and communicated to all relevant personnel. It may include events of exposure and accidental release. Accidents and incidents provide an indication that the systems designed to manage biorisk may have failed; it is essential that lessons be learnt and improvements made where possible. The accident/incident investigation process should include at a minimum: a. creating a culture of self-reporting incidents, including \"near misses\" and incidents that may trigger an investigation or emergency response; b. identifying those responsible for maintaining the accident/ incident reporting system; c. defining what constitutes an accident/incident and what triggers recording and reporting, with emphasis on events that may result in exposure to live poliovirus (e.g. sticks, spills, splashes, sprays, leaks, aerosol generating events); d. defining what constitutes a significant poliovirus exposure (e.g. ingestion) and thresholds for initiating procedures to determine whether individuals are infected; e. specifying required documentation to support the system, as well as the frequency and distribution of reports generated and communicated to relevant personnel; f. identifying the reports that will be generated, as well as their frequency and distribution; g. establishing a poliovirus incident evaluation/response team (composed of facility medical, public-health and polio- specific expertise) that determines whether an exposure is significant, reports its findings to the senior manager and recommends such actions as deemed necessary; WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) ANNEX 2: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FACILITIES HOLDING WILD POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS74 CWA15793 Clause No.18Biorisk Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of WPV2Requirements for Final Containment of all WPVGuidance h. establishing and publicizing 24-hour accident/incident reporting channels, and identifying those responsible for maintaining the system; i. ensuring an analysis of trends; j. identifying root causes using individuals trained in investigation techniques; k. providing feedback at regular intervals and action-tracking mechanisms to ensure lessons learnt result in action to avoid repeating such events and/or to minimize their potential impact; l. identifying where security professionals may be required to coordinate with law enforcement. Element 12 - Facility Physical Requirements The Facility Physical Requirements element looks at how the organization addresses biorisk during periods when something new is introduced or the existing set-up is changed. Issues addressed include identifying the people who need to be involved and consulted, incorporating biorisk into planning, approaching commissioning in a structured way (including the role of suppliers), considering the physical characteristics of the materials used and carrying out any certification that may be needed.

CWA 4.4.4.8.112.1.2 The design process identifies and incorporates all relevant legislative requirements, together with information from recognized standards, guidelines (WHO Laboratory biosafety manual, Third edition , 2004), industry good practices and facility-specific risk assessments. The design process should include identifying and reviewing relevant legislation and codes of practice (including building codes as well as those related to laboratory biosafety/laboratory biosecurity) and risk assessments. The requirements identified from these sources should be incorporated into the design plans. The design should be fully documented, including a description of the tests and standards of acceptance to ensure performance. The process should be documented and transparent to provide assurance that it has been comprehensive and thorough. CWA 4.4.4.8.112.1.3 The design process identifies and facilitates consultation with all relevant parties associated with the facility and its operation. The design process should include identifying and consulting with individuals involved in the planning, construction, operation and maintenance of the facility. The following roles/individuals should be considered in terms of information requirements and consultation: a. scientific personnel and other end users; b. the biorisk management adviser and biorisk management committee; c. biosecurity and/or security personnel; d. designers (architects and engineers); e. constructors; f. maintenance engineers; g. material and equipment suppliers; h. commissioning agents; i. certifiers; j. regulators; k.

The commissioning process should start at the design phase during the first stage of science programme definition to ensure the expectations for the building are achievable. The commissioning plan should be developed in detail in parallel with the physical concept to ensure the expectations for the building are measurable. The commissioning plan should clearly identify all the steps from beginning to end, providing examples and including the conditions of acceptance of each step as a prerequisite for proceeding to the next. The commissioning plan should identify all steps required before operation is commenced initially or resumed after any temporary WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII)ANNEX 2: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL HOLDING WILD POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS77CWA15793 Clause No.18Biorisk Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of WPV2Requirements for Final Containment of all WPVGuidance shutdown. The commissioning process should provide the benchmark for acceptable facility operation and the description of the programme to be put in place to maintain that level of performance. The decommissioning process should identify the decontamination procedures and security-related measures that must be in place for the facility's temporary or final shutdown. The decommissioning programme should describe not only the procedures, but also the standards of acceptance when those procedures are performed. This may be documented through clearance certificates and permits to work, which identify when and under what conditions the decommissioned facility can be re-entered. 12.3 Infrastructure and Operational Management CWA 4.4.4.812.3.1 Facilities, equipment and processes are designed and run in a safe and secure way with respect to biorisk management.

The organization will ensure that access to poliovirus containment areas is limited to members of personnel who have been screened for subversive behaviours/ associations or criminal records or to those accompanied at all times by authorized individuals (as in the case of visitors, contractors, etc.). The screening includes: a. association with organizations that could present a threat to the facility's integrity; b. medical conditions that could lead to unstable/undesirable behaviour; c. assurance that individuals do not work under the influence of drugs or alcohol. CWA 4.4.4.7.116.3.2 The organization ensures that individuals' access to facilities or work is controlled, according to the policy.Where lawful and appropriate as determined by risk assessments, screening may include such checks as identity and immigration status, membership in organizations hostile to biological research, criminal records and financial probity. 16.4 Personal Security CWA 4.4.4.1016.4.1 A policy is in place to provide personal security support services to staff members, including, where appropriate, personal security awareness training.

The Global Action Plan addresses that risk by establishing a post-eradication/post-OPV cessation goal of retaining poliovirus in a limited number of poliovirus-essential facilities worldwide. The Global Action Plan further reduces the risk posed by these facilities by establishing international standards for primary safeguards of facility containment, secondary safeguards of population immunity, and tertiary safeguards of facility location and assurance through national and international oversight that such standards are met. Primary safeguards minimize the risk of facility-associated poliovirus release and include facility management; the design and operation of the containment facility; practices and procedures; the vaccination of facility personnel and their close family members; and contingency plans for potential virus release or exposure. Secondary safeguards of population immunity minimize the consequence of a poliovirus release from a poliovirus- essential containment facility and consist of a national routine childhood immunization policy and demonstrated high (=DTP3; >90%) national population coverage (12). Tertiary safeguards of facility location minimize the risk of transmissible poliovirus by placing such facilities in areas with closed sewage systems with secondary or greater effluent treatment. Primary and secondary safeguards are required within three months of the tOPV-bOPV switch for poliovirus-essential facilities handling and storing only OPV2/Sabin2 materials, and three months after bOPV cessation for poliovirus-essential facilities handling and storing any OPV/Sabin materials. WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 95 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)This \"Biorisk standard for poliovirus-essential facilities holding only OPV/Sabin poliovirus materials\" describes the international requirements for the primary safeguards established for poliovirus-essential laboratories handling and storing OPV/Sabin materials or for Sabin-IPV production facilities. This standard is based on CWA15793, Laboratory biorisk management (2), the principles of the WHO Laboratory biosafety manual, Third edition (17) and the extensive poliovirus scientific literature spanning nearly seven decades (10). This standard serves as the framework for national certification and WHO verification (Annex 4). It consists of 16 elements and subelements based on the principles of a quality management system. It assumes that the organization is best placed to understand the risks associated with its work and can manage those risks in a number of ways acceptable to the national and international bodies responsible for facility oversight. This standard further assumes that poliovirus-essential facility personnel and management at all levels fully appreciate the enormity of the consequences of accidental or malicious poliovirus release in the post-eradication/post-OPV era and are prepared to demonstrate that the appropriate systems and controls are in place to manage those risks. Poliovirus facility-associated risks Polioviruses under moist conditions in clinical or environmental samples can survive indefinitely in the laboratory freezer ( <-20 \u00b0C), for many months in the refrigerator and for weeks on the bench top at ambient temperatures (18). Infectivity is inactivated by dehydration, heat ( >50 \u00b0C) or treatment with dilute solutions of formaldehyde or bleach at appropriate concentrations. The most common routes of exposure to infectious agents in the facility environment are (1) ingestion; (2) inhalation; (3) injection; and (4) contaminated skin and mucous membranes. The infectious dose is a factor of virus virulence, the route of presentation and virus particles in sufficient number to overcome mechanical loss and natural and immune host defences. In the poliovirus facility, poliovirus content of common materials ranges from a of 103.7 CCID 50/g culture harvests, and 1011 CCID 50/ml in concentrates in vaccine production facilities. Sabin strains are less pathogenic than wild and have lower secondary infection rates, but all three Sabin virus types have been linked to vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) outbreaks. Ingestion presents the highest risk for facility personnel. Immunization with OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) prevents disease, but neither fully inhibits silent poliovirus infection nor reinfection of the gut. Ingestion of poliovirus may result from any laboratory operation, activity or incident that leads to the transfer of infectious particles to the gastrointestinal tract. Estimated infectious doses (ID 50) by ingestion, based on studies with infants and children, are \u00b1101 CCID 50 for wild polioviruses and \u00b1103 CCID 50 for Sabin strains. Immunized adult laboratory workers are likely more resistant than immunologically na\u00efve children, but resistance is dose related and may be overcome by ingesting sufficient poliovirus particles. Droplets created by sprays, spills and the splash of poliovirus cell cultures (108 CCID 50) and concentrates (1011 CCID 50) constitute the highest personnel exposure risks (Figure A3.1). WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 96 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)Inhalation, defined as exposure to small particle aerosols of <5 m (droplet nuclei) deposited predominately in the lower respiratory tract, has been identified as a possible route of infection for poliovirus. The respiratory tract appears not to be a significant portal of entry. Unresolved, however, is whether small particle aerosols deposited in the lower respiratory tract may initiate alimentary tract infections through mucociliary transport to the pharyngeal region. Inhalation risks may be further reduced in facility environments maintained at low relative humidity ( <50%). Antibodies acquired through immunization greatly reduce infection risks from injection or breaks in skin or mucous membranes. Figure A3.1: Estimated poliovirus content and infectious dose19 Virus content (CCID50) Estimated infectious dose (ID 50) Sabin PV Wild PV Pharyngeal (per concentrates (per ml)1014 1012 1010 108 106 104 102 0 Community members may be exposed to infectious agents from the laboratory through (1) workers' contaminated skin or clothing or unrecognized infection; (2) the release of contaminated air; (3) contaminated effluents and waste water recovered from secondary sewage treatment plants; (4) the uncontrolled transport of infectious material; (5) solid waste transported to landfills; (6) contaminated equipment or materials removed from the facility; (7) the escape of infected animals; and (8) a theft or deliberate release of infectious agents from a facility. Exposure risks through routes 4-7 are low for poliovirus facilities that adhere to international regulations for the transport of infectious substances, those outlined in the Good Laboratory Practice handbook and the WHO guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practice , and likely low for the inhalation of contaminated air effluent where facilities maintain low relative humidity environments and exhaust air away from direct human exposure. Exposure risks through the ingestion of effluents range between high and low, depending on the poliovirus content of facility effluent, sewerage system size and integrity, and the potential for human consumption. Risks of community exposure are highest through facility personnel unknowingly contaminated or infected with poliovirus. IPV immunization of facility personnel may greatly reduce the risk of intra- and extra- household transmission. 19 Estimated infectious doses (ID 50) are based on studies with infants and children. Immunized adult laboratory workers are likely much more resistant than immunologically na\u00efve children. However, dose-related resistance may be overcome by ingesting sufficient poliovirus particles. WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 97 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)Effective poliovirus risk management is achieved by the careful assessment of exposure risks, the implementation of risk-appropriate personnel protection measures, and the quality operation of a facility designed to minimize the risk of poliovirus contamination and dissemination to the community. The main risk is the infection of laboratory workers by ingestion. Airborne transmission is conceivable but not demonstrated and infection through parenteral exposure such as needlestick is unlikely in immunized individuals.

Effective management and organization are vital to the success of any activity, and management commitment and leadership lay the foundation upon which a solid biorisk management system is built. Management must have clear strategies and objectives from which roles and responsibilities are allocated, implemented and monitored.

CWA 4.3.3.21.2.2 Management has established the controls and put in place documented procedures for monitoring the effectiveness of the controls being applied to reduce or eliminate the hazards identified in the risk assessment process. The controls can be monitored by regular audits, by utilizing corrective-action reporting processes where problems have been identified, by investigating incidents and accidents and improving controls and their implementation, and by ensuring adequate resources are provided to maintain the effectiveness of the controls. Note: Refer to Element 2 - Risk Assessment. 1.3 Roles, Responsibilities and Authorities CWA 4.4.1.11.3.1 Top management takes ultimate responsibility for the organization's biorisk management system. Top management includes officers (Director-General, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, etc.) and directors of the organization. Overall responsibility for managing biorisk rests with top management but tasks may be delegated through the organization provided they are passed to competent individuals with adequate resources to perform the activities safely and securely. In smaller organizations, one individual may hold more than one role described in this standard. It is important to define roles and responsibilities, have clear communication within the organization regarding actions that need to be taken, and establish who has the required authority. WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 101 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)CWA15793 Clause Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 materialsRequirements Final containment of all OPV/Sabin poliovirus materialsGuidance CWA 4.4.1.11.3.2 Top management ensures that roles, responsibilities and authority related to biorisk management are defined, documented and communicated to those who manage, perform and verify work associated with the control of polioviruses. In assigning roles and responsibilities, potential conflicts of interest should be considered. This standard has identified roles that need to be covered in the organization and has only used titles to illustrate these roles; these titles may not be the same as those used in specific organizations. CWA 4.4.1.11.3.3 Top management demonstrates its commitment by ensuring the availability of resources to establish, implement, maintain and improve the biorisk management system.Resources include human resources and specialized skills, organizational infrastructure, technology and financial resources. CWA 4.4.1.2 1.3.4 A senior manager has been designated with the operational responsibility to oversee the biorisk management system.Senior managers are those with significant operational, budgetary and personnel authority at the departmental or higher level, and may include members of top management. CWA 4.4.1.2 1.3.5 The senior manager's functions in managing biorisk include: 1. providing appropriate resources to ensure the adequate provision of personnel, facilities and other resources deemed necessary for the safe and secure operation of the facility; 2. reporting to top management on the performance of the biorisk management system and any need for improvement; 3. ensuring the promotion of the biorisk management system throughout the organization; 4. instituting review, audit and reporting measures to provide assurance that the requirements of this standard are being implemented and maintained effectively;The senior management representative should be an individual with decision-making authority at a level whereby he/she can allocate resources and make decisions regarding the facility's biorisk management needs (including required resources to conduct risk assessments and other management and administrative activities) independently of the need to implement the programme of work. CWA 4.4.1.31.3.6 A biorisk management committee has been constituted to act as an independent review group for biorisk issues associated with the poliovirus facility.The biorisk management committee is often recognized as the institutional biosafety committee. Its role may be either a dedicated function or one that is addressed through a committee with a wider remit. Members may include the scientific manager, additional scientific specialists, the biorisk management WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 102 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)CWA15793 Clause Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 Final containment of all OPV/Sabin poliovirus materialsGuidance adviser(s), the security manager and the occupational health professional.

CWA 4.3.1.12.1.2 The risk management system's performance is reported to senior management for review and as a basis for improvement. CWA 4.4.42.1.3 The organization has identified those operations and activities associated with possible biological risk and where control measures are to be applied. CWA 4.4.42.1.4 Activities associated with possible biological risk, including maintenance, are carried out under specified conditions. 2.2 Assessment Timing and Scope CWA 4.3.1.22.2.1 The approach to risk assessment is defined according to its scope, nature and timing so it is proactive rather than reactive.The following should trigger either a new risk assessment or the review of an existing one: a. commencement of new work or changes to the programme of work, including the introduction of new biological agents or alterations to workflow or volume; b. new construction/modifications to laboratories, plants and equipment or their operation; c. introduction of altered and unplanned staffing arrangements, including those concerning contractors, visitors and other non- core personnel; d. significant alterations to SOPs or working practices (e.g. disinfection/waste management methodologies, PPE provision, usage entry, exit protocols); e. unexpected events that may be relevant to the management of biorisks; f. actual or potential nonconformity with internal/external rules and regulations (e.g. the introduction of new legislation or major accident exposure); WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 116 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)CWA15793 Clause Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 materialsRequirements for Final containment of all OPV/Sabin poliovirus materialsGuidance g. consideration of emergency response and contingency planning requirements; h. the existing management system review process (e.g. annually or at another appropriate and predetermined frequency). Many defined methodologies and approaches are available to conduct hazard identification, risk assessment and control; the approach taken will vary depending on the nature of the situation and the level of detail required. One framework that organizations may consider adopting is outlined in Figure 1 of CWA15793, 2011 (GAPIII, Annex 5). 2.3 Roles and Responsibilities CWA 4.3.1.12.3.1 Resource requirements have been identified and adequate resources provided, including assigning trained personnel to management, work performance and verification activities, including internal review.The roles and responsibilities of personnel who perform and verify work affecting risk management should be defined and documented, particularly for people who need the organizational freedom and authority to: a. initiate action to prevent or reduce the adverse effects of risk; b. control the further treatment of risks until the level of risk becomes acceptable; c. identify and record any problems related to managing risks; d. initiate, recommend or provide solutions through designated channels; e. communicate and consult internally and externally as appropriate. 2.4 Hazard Identification CWA 4.3.1.32.4.1 The hazards associated with proposed work are: 1. identified; 2. documented.The first stage in the risk management process is to identify all hazards relevant to biorisk. It is useful to involve the whole work team in this process and to use inputs from organizational experts on safety and risk management. WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 117 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)CWA15793 Clause Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 materialsRequirements for Final containment of all OPV/Sabin poliovirus materialsGuidance A hazard may be a physical situation (e.g. a fire or explosion), an activity (e.g. pipetting) or a material (in this case, the principal hazard is most likely to be a poliovirus, but others include chemicals and asphyxiating gases such as nitrogen). The essence of a hazard is its potential to cause harm, regardless of how likely such an occurrence might be. Biological hazards should be identified and assessed in relation to their potential damage to humans, animals and the environment. Where hazardous materials are classified into hazard or risk groups based on international and/or foreign country classification schemes, local diverging needs and constraints should be considered. A hazard identification exercise should use information that includes: a. group experience and knowledge; b. external or specialized expertise not found in the facility; c. results of previous assessments; d. surveys of previous accidents/incidents; e. hazardous materials data; f. information on hazardous organisms; g. guidelines and codes of practice; h. facility drawings; i. SOPs, manuals, etc.; j. process maps. Defined methodologies and approaches are available to conduct hazard identification exercises. Unless hazards are identified effectively, it is not possible to assess the risk associated with WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 118 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)CWA15793 Clause Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 materialsRequirements for Final containment of all OPV/Sabin poliovirus materialsGuidance the facility and its activities. Hazard identification should be appropriate in nature and structure, and recorded to a level whereby others can review the process. 2.5 Risk Assessment CWA 4.3.1.42.5.1 Suitable methodologies for assessing and recording risks are: 1. identified; 2. implemented; 3. maintained. Risk assessments are documented.The risk assessment should categorize risks to identify those that need to be eliminated or controlled. Descriptions of likelihood and consequence, together with the acceptability of risk levels, should be defined and used in the assessment. Such a classification can be achieved, for example, by using a risk matrix that identifies likelihood and consequence categories, ordered to illustrate those falling into high, moderate and low zones. However, other approaches may also be relevant and appropriate. Assessments can be qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative, and a method suitable to the situation should be identified and followed. In conducting the assessment, due consideration should be given to the inherent risk from polioviruses (e.g. from risk grouping descriptions, material safety data sheets). After defining and implementing control measures, the risks should be reviewed to decide whether the remaining risk is acceptable or additional controls need to be identified and implemented. 2.6 Risk Control CWA 4.3.1.5.2.6.1 Suitable methodologies for allocating actions that result from risk assessments, including timelines, responsible persons and associated reporting and approval mechanisms, are: 1. identified; The risk management approach should have a control plan that includes: a. who is responsible and accountable for implementing the plan; WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 119 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)CWA15793 Clause Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 materialsRequirements Final all OPV/Sabin poliovirus materialsGuidance 2. implemented; 3. maintained.b. what resources are to be used (e.g. people, budget); c. a timetable for implementation; d. details of the mechanism and frequency of reviewing compliance with the plan. Risk management strategies should include the hierarchies of control. These are elimination of the work, substitution with an alternative organism/activity, isolation of the hazard, the use of engineering controls, administrative controls or the reliance on PPE. Element 3 - Poliovirus Inventory and Information The Poliovirus Inventory and Information element examines the systems in place to identify, record and review the organisms stored, received and transported from a facility. The level of detail and nature of the system depends on the pathogens being held, and ranges in complexity from simple lists to secure databases. This element also examines the way materials are stored, including segregation, labelling systems and controls of stocks of cultures.

Controls should be put in place to ensure all the necessary checks and documented assurances are received to guarantee that requests for poliovirus materials originate from legitimate facilities and individuals. Material may only be brought into the facility or sent elsewhere if authorized by those responsible for the facility. For materials deemed to be of high risk, more stringent controls, including shipment tracking and the verification of receipt, are necessary. 3.4 Monitoring and Control CWA 4.5.33.4.1 The inventory is reviewed at predetermined intervals based on risk, and at a level and frequency whereby materials can be accounted for in an appropriate manner.The nature of the inventory and associated controls should be based on the nature of the material held and on the risk of harm should it be misplaced or removed with the intention of misuse. Poliovirus inventories will be monitored so that materials missing, unaccounted for or no longer needed are identified, WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 122 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)CWA15793 Clause Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 materialsRequirements for Final containment of all OPV/Sabin poliovirus materialsGuidance consistent with the goal of reducing amounts of live poliovirus materials to the lowest level possible.

Measures should be implemented when needed to identify non- responders to vaccination (depending on the vaccine's response rate) and a policy should be in place to address these individuals. Individuals considered unfit for work in the facility on health grounds should be identified and prevented from accessing areas with risk of exposure. Areas requiring vaccinations to enter should be posted. Visitors, contractors and other non-core personnel should provide evidence of vaccination or of established immunity in accordance with the above requirement. Based on risk, reasonable measures should be taken to ensure that the vaccinations have been given and current certificates are valid. This may include examining original certificates and cross-checking with medical practices responsible for administering the vaccine. The organization should ensure the required or recommended vaccines are made available to concerned personnel. Vaccination should be seen as a risk- mitigation strategy and its use should in no way infer that other controls, such as the use of good microbiological techniques or PPE, can be relaxed. CWA 4.4.4.6.19.2.2 A vaccination policy has been defined and implemented. CWA 4.4.4.6.19.2.3 Access to laboratories or work is controlled for individuals until they comply with the vaccination policy. The organization will ensure the availability of IPV for individuals associated with the facility, consistent with the objectives to: WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 134 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)CWA15793 Clause Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 materialsRequirements for Final containment of all OPV/Sabin poliovirus materialsGuidance a. restrict access to the containment facility to individuals who have demonstrable immunity to poliovirus (defined as annual verification of serum neutralizing antibody titres of 1:8 or greater against all three poliovirus types), including: personnel assigned to work within the containment perimeter; contractors, auditors and visitors who must enter the containment perimeter; support personnel and contractors working immediately outside the containment perimeter (e.g. maintenance personnel, cleaning staff); b. administer an IPV booster every three years to all personnel mentioned above or in the event of an antibody titre determined to be <1:8 via annual testing; c. provide effective secondary population safeguards by an established programme of education and promotion to encourage acceptance of immunization by: - non-core facility personnel, including contractors; - workers' families/companions; - other groups in contact with the facility. 9.3 Medical Emergencies CWA 4.4.5.29.3.1 A system is established to effectively manage medical and/or environmental emergencies, including but not limited to identifying potentially infected workers and providing immediate medical care to exposed, ill or injured workers.Procedures should ensure that adequate emergency planning is provided to address worker health needs in the event of an accident or emergency situation. This provision should extend to first responders and their families, to members of the broader community and to environmental conditions that may have been affected by the incident. It should include identifying emergency scenarios (e.g. involving an infected worker/family member) and necessary support measures (e.g. liaison with emergency services/ WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 135 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)CWA15793 Clause Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 materialsRequirements for Final containment of all OPV/Sabin poliovirus materialsGuidance local authorities), and providing equipment and other resources required to manage the emergency (e.g. prophylaxis, post-exposure treatment, disinfectants, isolation requirements, vaccines). The necessary plans and other materials for managing medical emergencies should be prepared, tested and maintained. Procedures should ensure that adequate first aid is available in relation to credible accident scenarios, as identified during risk assessments. The procedures should address the need for adequately trained personnel and their availability, as well as equipment and other materials that may be required to provide treatment. Procedures should ensure additional competent medical support is identified and made available (e.g. hospitals, isolation units). Element 10 - Emergency Response and Contingency Planning The Emergency Response and Contingency Planning element examines the structures and mechanisms in place to cope with working outside normal operating conditions, and how to react proportionally to emergency situations. Issues addressed include physical requirements, capacity in terms of personnel and facilities and of protective and rescue systems, emergency communications, decision-making authorities and the development and testing of emergency scenarios and simulations.

It is unlikely that all potential scenarios will be credible, but all reasonable threats should be considered and recorded and, where appropriate, the rationale for dismissing any issue should be provided. Scenarios considered should include: a. an infected/potentially infected worker or other contact (e.g. family member, emergency responder or community member); b. accident or illness to a worker within the containment area and need for evacuation; c. fire; d. flood; e. breach of security; f. explosion; g. the potential loss of poliovirus through theft or any other reason; h. unexpected virulence (unknown biological agents or biological agents expected to be avirulent); i. physical facility and equipment failure, including a control system failure of the disinfection regime; j. utility failure including electricity, gas, steam and water supplies; k. a major spillage/aerosol release; l. environmental release; m. a natural disaster (e.g. earthquake, extreme weather conditions, disease pandemics); WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 137 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)CWA15793 Clause Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 materialsRequirements for Final containment of all OPV/Sabin poliovirus materialsGuidance n. an act of terrorism or deliberate vandalism, extortion; o. intense media attention. 10.2 Emergency Response and Planning CWA 4.4.510.2.1 Plans and procedures are established and maintained to: 1. identify the potential for incidents and emergency situations involving biological agents, toxins and materials; 2. prevent their occurrence; 3. respond to emergency situations; 4. limit the likelihood of illness or other damage that may be associated with them. CWA 4.4.510.2.2 Emergency planning covers all aspects of biorisk and includes general safety, security and medical issues. A system is established to effectively manage a confirmed facility- associated poliovirus infection until the individual is free of poliovirus in stools for three consecutive days. This includes procedures for: 1. isolating infected individuals, particularly from children and the unimmunized; 2. collecting and disinfecting stool and associated waste; 3. educating families and frequent contacts on the risk posed by poliovirus infection and the procedures for isolation; 4. communicating with relevant national and local officials to evaluate the needs to implement community immunization response plans; 5. notifying WHO; 6. disinfecting areas potentially contaminated by infected individuals. 10.3 Emergency Plans CWA 4.4.5.210.3.1 Biorisks are taken into account when preparing and implementing emergency plans. The organization should ensure that plans address the following needs at a minimum: WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 138 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)CWA15793 Clause Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 materialsRequirements for Final containment of all OPV/Sabin poliovirus materialsGuidance A system is established to effectively manage incidents that are determined by the evaluation/response team to be significant poliovirus exposures, including: 1. implementing full preventive measures by isolating individuals under evaluation from children and the unimmunized in particular, and securing stool and associated waste; 2. educating individuals under investigation, their family and close contacts on the risk of poliovirus infection to the community, the procedures for diagnosis and the precautionary measures required to prevent possible transmission; 3. initiating procedures to determine whether individuals are infected, by collecting and testing nose, throat and stool specimens daily for a minimum of seven days post-exposure.a. identifying those responsible for devising, implementing and testing the control measures specified, along with ensuring their conclusions are effectively communicated to all relevant personnel; b. ensuring the legality and enforceability of proposed emergency response plans; c. responding during emergencies occurring outside working hours as well as those occurring during normal working hours; d. providing for periods of reduced staff availability (e.g. during weekends and holiday periods); e. ensuring emergency access/exit, including the ability to override access controls as appropriate; f. providing emergency exit routes that avoid evacuating people through containment areas; g. providing for the safe removal, transport, transfer, treatment and accommodation of contaminated persons and objects; h. informing visitors and contractors about emergency response plans and the possible consequences of exposure. CWA 4.4.5.210.3.2 Control measures in place can be demonstrated as being reasonable and proportionate to the scale and nature of the emergency. CWA 4.4.5.210.3.3 Emergency plans are effectively communicated to all employees and relevant third parties, and tested with the goal of making everyone aware of their obligations. In the event of an emergency situation, it may be necessary to involve parties external to the organization. Based on the credible scenarios identified, the organization should pinpoint such agencies to establish their role in responding to a given situation. The organization may choose to sign memoranda of understanding or agreements with key local responders. It may also be necessary to inform and educate such parties on their role and any risk exposures they may face, and ensure their actions will not unnecessarily increase the risk associated with the emergency (e.g. uncontrolled use of water for fires).

WHO. 10.4 Emergency Exercises and Simulations CWA 4.4.5.310.4.1 Structured and realistic emergency exercises and simulations, including security drills, are conducted at regular intervals based on risk, to test the plans, prepare personnel and learn from any good practices or deficiencies identified. Exercises and simulations should be conducted to provide assurance that plans are effective and to learn from any lessons that arise. Exercises should be planned and every effort made to ensure they realistically represent the events simulated. However, such activities should also be conducted under controlled conditions and not be allowed to become a source of risk in their own right. The results of an exercise should be documented and reviewed for lessons learnt, and feedback on performance should be provided to the appropriate personnel. Any resulting actions should be recorded and allocated to named individuals, and measures should be put in place to ensure they are closed out effectively. 10.5 Contingency Plans WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 140 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)CWA15793 Clause Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 materialsRequirements Final containment of all OPV/Sabin poliovirus materialsGuidance CWA 4.4.5.410.5.1 In the event of an emergency, adequate contingency measures are in place to ensure the safety and security of continued operations. Normal operating conditions may be disrupted in the event of an emergency or unforeseen event. This could range from safely shutting down work during a power failure, to obtaining alternative storage conditions in the event of a breakdown. Such eventualities should be considered proactively, and contingency plans put in place. Activities should address the need for adequate redundancy, replacement and other measures, which could involve the availability of alternative facilities or personnel, the introduction of backup systems (e.g. power supplies), alternative means of decontaminating materials in the event of the failure of critical systems or equipment (e.g. kill tanks or autoclaves), or the complete safe shutdown of operations in extreme situations. Element 11 - Accident/Incident Investigation The Accident/Incident Investigation element addresses activities that define the facts and circumstances related to an event, determine the causes and develop remedial action to control biorisk and prevent recurrence. Often, chance is the only reason a property-damage accident or near-miss incident does not result in infection or personal harm. Likewise, chance alone often determines whether an accident's consequences are minor, serious or catastrophic. This element examines the organization's reporting and investigation system, whether the right people are involved and how corrective and preventive actions are implemented.

Procedures should be put in place to ensure that what constitutes an accident or incident is clearly defined and communicated to all relevant personnel. It may include events of exposure and accidental release. Accidents and incidents provide an indication that the systems designed to manage biorisk may have failed; it is essential that lessons be learnt and improvements made where possible. The accident/incident investigation process should include at a minimum: a. creating a culture of self-reporting incidents, including \"near misses\" and incidents that may trigger an investigation or emergency response; b. identifying those responsible for maintaining the accident/ incident reporting system; c. defining what constitutes an accident/incident and what triggers recording and reporting, with emphasis on events that may result in exposure to live poliovirus (e.g. sticks, spills, splashes, sprays, leaks, aerosol generating events); d. defining what constitutes a significant poliovirus exposure (e.g. ingestion) and thresholds for initiating procedures to determine whether individuals are infected; e. specifying required documentation to support the system, as well as the frequency and distribution of reports generated and communicated to relevant personnel; f. identifying the reports that will be generated, as well as their frequency and distribution; g. establishing a poliovirus incident evaluation/response team (composed of facility medical, public-health and polio-specific expertise) that determines whether an exposure is significant, reports its findings to the senior manager and recommends such actions as deemed necessary; WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 142 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)CWA15793 Clause Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 materialsRequirements for Final containment of all OPV/Sabin poliovirus materialsGuidance h. establishing and publicizing 24-hour accident/incident reporting channels, and identifying those responsible for maintaining the system; i. ensuring an analysis of trends; j. identifying root causes using individuals trained in investigation techniques; k. providing feedback at regular intervals and action-tracking mechanisms to ensure lessons learnt result in action to avoid repeating such events and/or to minimize their potential impact; l. identifying where security professionals may be required to coordinate with law enforcement. Element 12 - Facility Physical Requirements The Facility Physical Requirements element looks at how the organization addresses biorisk during periods when something new is introduced or the existing set-up is changed. Issues addressed include identifying the people who need to be involved and consulted, incorporating biorisk into planning, approaching commissioning in a structured way (including the role of suppliers), considering the physical characteristics of the materials used and carrying out any certification that may be needed.

Engineering and operational solutions will be incorporated that are consistent with the risk posed by the properties of the materials to be stored and handled in the facility and the nature of the work to be carried out. CWA 4.4.4.8.112.1.2 The design process identifies and incorporates all relevant legislative requirements, together with information from recognized standards, guidelines (WHO Laboratory biosafety manual , Third edition , 2004), industry good practices and facility-specific risk assessments. The design process should include identifying and reviewing relevant legislation and codes of practice (including building codes as well as those related to laboratory biosafety/laboratory biosecurity) and risk assessments. The requirements identified from these sources should be incorporated into the design plans. The design should be fully documented, including a description of the tests and standards of acceptance to ensure performance. The process should be documented and transparent to provide assurance that it has been comprehensive and thorough. CWA 4.4.4.8.112.1.3 The design process identifies and facilitates consultation with all relevant parties associated with the facility and its operation. The design process should include identifying and consulting with individuals involved in the planning, construction, operation and maintenance of the facility. The following roles/individuals should be considered in terms of information requirements and consultation: a. scientific personnel and other end users; b. the biorisk management adviser and biorisk management committee; c. biosecurity and/or security personnel; d. designers (architects and engineers); e. constructors; f. maintenance engineers; g. material and equipment suppliers; h. commissioning agents; WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 144 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)CWA15793 Clause Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 materialsRequirements Final certifiers; j. regulators; k.

CWA 4.4.4.8.112.1.4 All design features, construction techniques, materials and equipment selected are documented in line with the need to provide sufficiently specific and detailed instruction and information on the design specifications. CWA 4.4.4.8.112.1.5 New construction and physical facility modifications are carried out according to an approved plan. 12.2 Commissioning and Decommissioning CWA 4.4.4.8.212.2.1 A formal process exists for: 1. the initial commissioning of new facilities; 2. the final decommissioning of existing facilities.Commissioning will ensure that the facility is constructed and performs as intended. The commissioning process should start at the design phase during the first stage of science programme definition to ensure the expectations for the building are achievable. The commissioning plan should be developed in detail in parallel with the physical concept to ensure the expectations for the building are measurable. The commissioning plan should clearly identify all the steps from beginning to end, providing WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 145 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)CWA15793 Clause Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 materialsRequirements for Final containment of all OPV/Sabin poliovirus materialsGuidance examples and including the conditions of acceptance of each step as a prerequisite for proceeding to the next. The commissioning plan should identify all steps required before operation is commenced initially or resumed after any temporary shutdown. The commissioning process should provide the benchmark for acceptable facility operation and the description of the programme to be put in place to maintain that level of performance. The decommissioning process should identify the decontamination procedures and security-related measures that must be in place for the facility's temporary or final shutdown. The decommissioning programme should describe not only the procedures, but also the standards of acceptance when those procedures are performed. This may be documented through clearance certificates and permits to work, which identify when and under what conditions the decommissioned facility can be re-entered. 12.3 Infrastructure and Operational Management CWA 4.4.4.812.3.1 Facilities, equipment and processes are designed and run in a safe and secure way with respect to biorisk management. The poliovirus facility incorporates features that are guided by assessments of the risk of poliovirus reintroduction in the community and includes the following provisions: a. Poliovirus facilities are located in countries with demonstrated high national immunization coverage (= DTP3 coverage).

Poliovirus facilities are located in areas with closed sewage systems with secondary or greater treatment of effluents. c. Poliovirus facilities are either poliovirus dedicated or used on a campaign basis with documented effective decontamination procedures between periods of work with agents other than poliovirus. d. The containment perimeter is a defined working area sealable for gaseous decontamination and with sealed penetrations to prevent uncontrolled outward airflow. The containment perimeter is required irrespective of the choice of primary containment. e. The use of devices (e.g. BSCs) that are validated to maintain primary containment is required for all procedures using live poliovirus. Facilities using Class III BSCs will meet all physical aspects of this standard with deviation in procedures permitted during the BSC's normal operation (i.e. showering out is not required when Class III BSC is functioning properly). f. Controlled entry into the containment perimeter is through a double- door personnel airlock. Features include interlocking doors or an equivalent system to ensure that more than one door cannot be opened at a time, alarms, and associated operating procedures to ensure the building systems function effectively at all times. g. Controlled exit from the containment perimeter is via a walk-through exit shower. Showering is mandatory except for facilities employing fully functional Class III BSCs or similar isolators (in such facilities, showering out is required in the event of an uncontrolled breach of the primary containment equipment). h. Throughout the poliovirus type 2 containment period, a dose of IPV will be introduced, high global vaccine coverage will be maintained (population immunity is not expected to decline) and the use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) for outbreak response WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 147 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)CWA15793 Clause Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 materialsRequirements for Final containment of all OPV/Sabin poliovirus materialsGuidance is considered.

Procedures are established, validated and maintained for the effective poliovirus decontamination of the facility. Inactivation of poliovirus. Procedures are established and maintained to ensure the complete inactivation of all poliovirus from all materials and solid waste streams leaving the containment perimeter, including: 1. Heat sterilization (autoclaving) is the preferred method to inactivate polioviruses. 2. SOPs are available to address both routine and non-routine activities (e.g. daily routines vs major spills). 3. SOPs are developed to respond to the failure of the decontamination procedure or equipment. 4. SOPs are validated and shown to be effective against poliovirus prior to their use. 5. All materials leaving the containment perimeter, including clothing and liquid/solid waste, are heat sterilized or subject to chemical treatment of proven effectiveness prior to their removal. 6. All materials leaving the containment perimeter are accompanied by documentation on their decontamination. 7. Resources are available to deal with emergencies, accidents and other incidents. 8. Any live poliovirus that may be removed from the facility will be taken Whatever poliovirus materials are handled, a number of effective inactivation methods are likely to be available. The organization should ensure data are available to demonstrate that the methodology selected is capable of inactivating the poliovirus materials under the specific conditions encountered in the facility. Validation measures should consider such issues as: a. the nature of the material being treated (e.g. volume, presence of protein/other potentially inhibitory substances); b. contact times, material compatibility issues (e.g. interaction with stainless steel or rubber seals); c. potential health hazards associated with the disinfectant; d. the need to maintain the required level of active compound, including deterioration over time. In planning and conducting decontamination activities, the organization should consider: a. ensuring all disinfectants used contain sufficient active compound to address the working conditions under which they will be applied, and such concentrations are maintained throughout the process, including conducting specific validation activities where necessary; b. providing adequate facilities and procedures for the storage of waste (including short-term storage); c. ensuring methods are available to effectively decontaminate mixed waste (e.g. infected animals that have received radioactive materials); WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) 155 ANNEX 3: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR POLIOVIRUS-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES HOLDING ONLY OPV/SABIN POLIOVIRUS MATERIALS (NO WPV)CWA15793 Clause Management Element No.Requirements for Containment of OPV2/Sabin2 materialsRequirements for Final containment of all OPV/Sabin poliovirus materialsGuidance away in a dunk tank, decontamination chamber or other validated mechanism to ensure the disinfection of the exterior surfaces of any packaging materials used. 9.

The Global Action Plan addresses that risk by establishing a post-eradication/post-OPV cessation goal of not retaining poliovirus in poliovirus-non-essential facilities worldwide. As of Phase IIa, poliovirus-non-essential facilities (i.e. facilities that will not have a need to retain/store poliovirus infectious or potentially infectious materials) likely to investigate new WPV2, aVDPV2, cVDPV2 or iVDPV2 isolates, or new faecal and respiratory samples originating from recent OPV-using countries, are requested to: implement safe and secure working practices based on the risk assessment and appropriate biorisk management systems; not retain any WPV2 materials for long-term storage; immediately destroy any newly isolated WPV2 materials, or transfer them to a certified poliovirus-essential facility after notifying the MoH or another designated national authority and WHO. As of Phase IIb, the poliovirus-non-essential facilities described above are requested to: implement safe and secure working practices based on the risk assessment and appropriate biorisk management systems; not retain any WPV2 or OPV2/Sabin2 materials for long-term storage; immediately destroy any newly isolated type 2 poliovirus materials, or transfer them to a certified poliovirus-essential facility after notifying the MoH or another designated national authority and WHO. WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) ANNEX 6: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR SAFE HANDLING OF NEW SAMPLES POTENTIALLY CONTAINING POLIOVIRUS MATERIAL IN POLIOVIRUS-NON-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES 165 As of Phase IIIa, poliovirus-non-essential facilities (i.e. facilities that will not have a need to retain/store poliovirus infectious or potentially infectious materials) likely to investigate new WPV, aVDPV, cVDPV or iVDPV isolates, OPV2/Sabin2 materials or new faecal and respiratory samples originating from recent bOPV-using countries, are requested to: implement safe and secure working practices based on the risk assessment and appropriate biorisk management systems; not retain any WPV or OPV2/Sabin2 materials for long-term storage; immediately destroy any newly isolated WPV or OPV2/Sabin2 materials, or transfer them to a certified poliovirus-essential facility after notifying the MoH or another designated national authority and WHO. As of Phase IIIb, the poliovirus-non-essential facilities described above are requested to: implement safe and secure working practices based on the risk assessment and appropriate biorisk management systems; not retain any WPV or OPV/Sabin materials for long-term storage; immediately destroy any newly isolated poliovirus materials, or transfer them to a certified poliovirus-essential facility after notifying the MoH or another designated national authority and WHO. The table below describes the biorisk management standard for safe handling of new samples potentially containing poliovirus material in poliovirus-non-essential laboratories. This standard is based on CWA15793, Laboratory biorisk management (2). It consists of 16 elements and subelements based on the principles of a quality management system. It assumes that the organization is best placed to understand the risks associated with its work and can manage those risks in a number of ways acceptable to the national and international bodies responsible for facility oversight. This standard further assumes that poliovirus-essential facility personnel and management at all levels fully appreciate the enormity of the consequences of accidental or malicious poliovirus release in the post- eradication/post-OPV era and are prepared to demonstrate that the appropriate systems and controls are in place to manage those risks. Poliovirus facility-associated risks Polioviruses under moist conditions in clinical or environmental samples can survive indefinitely in the laboratory freezer ( <-20 \u00b0C), for many months in the refrigerator and for weeks on the bench top at ambient temperatures (18). Infectivity is inactivated by dehydration, heat ( >50 \u00b0C) or treatment with dilute solutions of formaldehyde or bleach at appropriate concentrations. The most common routes of exposure to infectious agents in the facility environment are (1) ingestion; (2) inhalation; (3) injection; and (4) contaminated skin and mucous membranes. The infectious dose is a factor of virus virulence, the route of presentation and virus particles in sufficient number to overcome mechanical loss and natural and immune host defences. In the poliovirus facility, poliovirus content of common materials ranges from a of 103.7 CCID 50/g culture harvests, and 1011 CCID 50/ml in concentrates in vaccine production facilities. Sabin strains are less pathogenic than wild and have lower secondary infection rates, but all three Sabin virus types have been linked to vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) outbreaks. WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII)ANNEX 6: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR SAFE HANDLING OF NEW SAMPLES POTENTIALLY CONTAINING POLIOVIRUS MATERIAL IN POLIOVIRUS-NON-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES 166Ingestion presents the highest risk for facility personnel. Immunization with OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) prevents disease, but neither fully inhibits silent poliovirus infection nor reinfection of the gut. Ingestion of poliovirus may result from any laboratory operation, activity or incident that leads to the transfer of infectious particles to the gastrointestinal tract. Estimated infectious doses (ID 50) by ingestion, based on studies with infants and children, are \u00b1101 CCID 50 for wild polioviruses and \u00b1103 CCID 50 for Sabin strains. Immunized adult laboratory workers are likely more resistant than immunologically na\u00efve children, but resistance is dose related and may be overcome by ingesting sufficient poliovirus particles. Droplets created by sprays, spills and the splash of poliovirus cell cultures (108 CCID 50) and concentrates (1011 CCID 50) constitute the highest personnel exposure risks (Figure A6.1). Inhalation, defined as exposure to small particle aerosols of <5 m (droplet nuclei) deposited predominately in the lower respiratory tract, has been identified as a possible route of infection for poliovirus. The respiratory tract appears not to be a significant portal of entry. Unresolved, however, is whether small particle aerosols deposited in the lower respiratory tract may initiate alimentary tract infections through mucociliary transport to the pharyngeal region. Inhalation risks may be further reduced in facility environments maintained at low relative humidity ( <50%). Antibodies acquired through immunization greatly reduce infection risks from injection or breaks in skin or mucous membranes.

Immunized adult laboratory workers are likely much more resistant than immunologically na\u00efve children. However, dose-related resistance may be overcome by ingesting sufficient poliovirus particles. WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) ANNEX 6: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR SAFE HANDLING OF NEW SAMPLES POTENTIALLY CONTAINING POLIOVIRUS MATERIAL IN POLIOVIRUS-NON-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES 167Community members may be exposed to infectious agents from the laboratory through (1) workers' contaminated skin or clothing or unrecognized infection; (2) the release of contaminated air; (3) contaminated effluents and waste water recovered from secondary sewage treatment plants; (4) the uncontrolled transport of infectious material; (5) solid waste transported to landfills; (6) contaminated equipment or materials removed from the facility; (7) the escape of infected animals; and (8) a theft or deliberate release of infectious agents from a facility. Exposure risks through routes 4-7 are low for poliovirus facilities that adhere to international regulations for the transport of infectious substances, those outlined in the Good Laboratory Practice handbook and the WHO guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practice , and likely low for the inhalation of contaminated air effluent where facilities maintain low relative humidity environments and exhaust air away from direct human exposure. Exposure risks through the ingestion of effluents range between high and low, depending on the poliovirus content of facility effluent, sewerage system size and integrity, and the potential for human consumption. Risks of community exposure are highest through facility personnel unknowingly contaminated or infected with poliovirus. IPV immunization of facility personnel may greatly reduce the risk of intra- and extra- household transmission. Effective poliovirus risk management is achieved by the careful assessment of exposure risks, the implementation of risk-appropriate personnel protection measures, and the quality operation of a facility designed to minimize the risk of poliovirus contamination and dissemination to the community. The main risk is the infection of laboratory workers by ingestion. Airborne transmission is conceivable but not demonstrated and infection through parenteral exposure such as needlestick is unlikely in immunized individuals.

CWA 4.4.42.1.4 Activities associated with possible biological risk, including maintenance, are carried out under specified conditions. 2.2 Assessment Timing and Scope CWA 4.3.1.22.2.1 The approach to risk assessment is defined according to its scope, nature and timing so it is proactive rather than reactive.The following should trigger either a new risk assessment or the review of an existing one: a. commencement of new work or changes to the programme of work, including the introduction of new biological agents or alterations to workflow or volume; b. new construction/modifications to laboratories, plants and equipment or their operation; c. introduction of altered and unplanned staffing arrangements, including those concerning contractors, visitors and other non- core personnel; WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) ANNEX 6: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR SAFE HANDLING OF NEW SAMPLES POTENTIALLY CONTAINING POLIOVIRUS MATERIAL IN POLIOVIRUS-NON-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES 185CWA15793 Clause No.23Biorisk Management Element No.Safe handling of new samples potentially containing poliovirus material in poliovirus-non-essential laboratoriesGuidance d. significant alterations to SOPs or working practices (e.g. disinfection/waste management methodologies, PPE provision, usage entry, exit protocols); e. unexpected events that may be relevant to the management of biorisks; f. actual or potential nonconformity with internal/external rules and regulations (e.g. the introduction of new legislation or major accident exposure); g. consideration of emergency response and contingency planning requirements; h. the existing management system review process (e.g. annually or at another appropriate and predetermined frequency). Many defined methodologies and approaches are available to conduct hazard identification, risk assessment and control; the approach taken will vary depending on the nature of the situation and the level of detail required. One framework that organizations may consider adopting is outlined in Figure 1 of CWA15793, 2011 (GAPIII, Annex 5). 2.3 Roles and Responsibilities CWA 4.3.1.12.3.1 Resource requirements have been identified and adequate resources provided, including assigning trained personnel to management, work performance and verification activities, including internal review.The roles and responsibilities of personnel who perform and verify work affecting risk management should be defined and documented, particularly for people who need the organizational freedom and authority to: a. initiate action to prevent or reduce the adverse effects of risk; b. control the further treatment of risks until the level of risk becomes acceptable; c. identify and record any problems related to managing risks; d. initiate, recommend or provide solutions through designated channels; WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII)ANNEX 6: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR SAFE HANDLING OF NEW SAMPLES POTENTIALLY CONTAINING POLIOVIRUS MATERIAL IN POLIOVIRUS-NON-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES 186CWA15793 Clause No.23Biorisk Management Element No.Safe handling of new samples potentially containing poliovirus material in poliovirus-non-essential laboratoriesGuidance e. communicate and consult internally and externally as appropriate. 2.4 Hazard Identification CWA 4.3.1.32.4.1 The hazards associated with proposed work are: 1. identified; 2. documented.The first stage in the risk management process is to identify all hazards relevant to biorisk. It is useful to involve the whole work team in this process and to use inputs from organizational experts on safety and risk management. A hazard may be a physical situation (e.g. a fire or explosion), an activity (e.g. pipetting) or a material (in this case, the principal hazard is most likely to be a poliovirus, but others include chemicals and asphyxiating gases such as nitrogen). The essence of a hazard is its potential to cause harm, regardless of how likely such an occurrence might be. Biological hazards should be identified and assessed in relation to their potential damage to humans, animals and the environment. Where hazardous materials are classified into hazard or risk groups based on international and/or foreign country classification schemes, local diverging needs and constraints should be considered. A hazard identification exercise should use information that includes: a. group experience and knowledge; b. external or specialized expertise not found in the facility; c. results of previous assessments; d. surveys of previous accidents/incidents; e. hazardous materials data; f. information on hazardous organisms; g. guidelines and codes of practice; WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) ANNEX 6: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR SAFE HANDLING OF NEW SAMPLES POTENTIALLY CONTAINING POLIOVIRUS MATERIAL IN POLIOVIRUS-NON-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES 187CWA15793 Clause No.23Biorisk Management Element No.Safe handling of new samples potentially containing poliovirus material in poliovirus-non-essential laboratoriesGuidance h. facility drawings; i. SOPs, manuals, etc.; j. process maps. Defined methodologies and approaches are available to conduct hazard identification exercises. Unless hazards are identified effectively, it is not possible to assess the risk associated with the facility and its activities. Hazard identification should be appropriate in nature and structure, and recorded to a level whereby others can review the process. 2.5 Risk Assessment CWA 4.3.1.42.5.1 Suitable methodologies for assessing and recording risks are: 1. identified; 2. implemented; 3. maintained. Risk assessments are documented.The risk assessment should categorize risks to identify those that need to be eliminated or controlled. Descriptions of likelihood and consequence, together with the acceptability of risk levels, should be defined and used in the assessment. Such a classification can be achieved, for example, by using a risk matrix that identifies likelihood and consequence categories, ordered to illustrate those falling into high, moderate and low zones. However, other approaches may also be relevant and appropriate. Assessments can be qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative, and a method suitable to the situation should be identified and followed. In conducting the assessment, due consideration should be given to the inherent risk from polioviruses (e.g. from risk grouping descriptions, material safety data sheets). After defining and implementing control measures, the risks should be reviewed to decide whether the remaining risk is acceptable or additional controls need to be identified and implemented. 2.6 Risk Control WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII)ANNEX 6: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR SAFE HANDLING OF NEW SAMPLES POTENTIALLY CONTAINING POLIOVIRUS MATERIAL IN POLIOVIRUS-NON-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES 188CWA15793 Clause No.23Biorisk Management Element No.Safe handling of new samples potentially containing poliovirus material in poliovirus-non-essential laboratoriesGuidance CWA 4.3.1.5.2.6.1 Suitable methodologies for allocating actions that result from risk assessments, including timelines, responsible persons and associated reporting and approval mechanisms, are: 1. identified; 2. implemented; 3. maintained.The risk management approach should have a control plan that includes: a. who is responsible and accountable for implementing the plan; b. what resources are to be used (e.g. people, budget); c. a timetable for implementation; d. details of the mechanism and frequency of reviewing compliance with the plan. Risk management strategies should include the hierarchies of control. These are elimination of the work, substitution with an alternative organism/activity, isolation of the hazard, the use of engineering controls, administrative controls or the reliance on PPE. Element 3 - Pathogen and Toxin Inventory and Information The Pathogen and Toxin Inventory and Information element examines the systems in place to identify, record and review the organisms stored, received and transported from a facility. The level of detail and nature of the system depends on the pathogens being held, and ranges in complexity from simple lists to secure databases. This element also examines the way materials are stored, including segregation, labelling systems and controls of stocks of cultures.

The inventory process should be based on risk and include: a. identifying all biological agents and toxins held, including cultures, specimens and other sources (e.g. infected tissues/ samples or animals); b. restricting access to biological agents and toxins to authorized individuals with a demonstrable legitimate need; c. implementing effective physical security measures according to risk (e.g. locks, alarms, access controls); d. developing and maintaining a reliable sample identification system; e. segregating and storing biological agents and toxins according to risk; f. determining what materials should be controlled (e.g. seed stocks, working stocks, infected animals) and what level of information should be captured in the inventory for these materials. 3.2 Information and Records CWA 4.4.4.23.2.1 Records related to the biological agents and toxins inventory are: 1. current; 2. complete; 3. stored securely with adequate backup provision.Inventory information should include: a. the name(s) and contact information of the individuals(s) responsible for the poliovirus material, and the details of other personnel with access to the poliovirus materials or the immediate area based on the level of risk; b. restricted access to the detailed inventory records to those individuals whose work requires access to that information; c. legible and robust identification numbers and other relevant identifiers; d. records of quantities/volumes of biological agents and toxins at an appropriate level and based on risk (i.e. for certain biological agents, the details of the location and responsible individual may be adequate while for others more information may be necessary); WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII)ANNEX 6: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR SAFE HANDLING OF NEW SAMPLES POTENTIALLY CONTAINING POLIOVIRUS MATERIAL IN POLIOVIRUS-NON-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES 190CWA15793 Clause No.23Biorisk Management Element No.Safe handling of new samples potentially containing poliovirus material in poliovirus-non-essential laboratoriesGuidance e. origin, including geographical source and date of collection; f. records of materials consumed, destroyed or removed from the facility. 3.3 Transfer of Biological Agents and Toxins CWA 4.4.4.23.3.1 Transfers of biological agents and toxins between laboratories at the facility or into and out of the facility are recorded and controlled in line with the level of risk. Controls should be put in place to ensure all the necessary checks and documented assurances are received to guarantee that requests for biological agents and toxins originate from legitimate facilities and individuals. Material may only be brought into the facility or sent elsewhere if authorized by those responsible for the facility. For materials deemed to be of high risk, more stringent controls, including shipment tracking and the verification of receipt, are necessary. 3.4 Monitoring and Control CWA 4.5.33.4.1 The inventory is reviewed at predetermined intervals based on risk, and at a level and frequency whereby materials can be accounted for in an appropriate manner.The nature of the inventory and associated controls should be based on the nature of the material held and on the risk of harm should it be misplaced or removed with the intention of misuse. The checks for many biological agents and toxins may be of a lower frequency and stringency than for others with greater potential for causing harm. Such measures may include the numbered sequences of tubes, periodic inspections and cross-checks with records of materials held. CWA 4.5.33.4.2 Measures are put in place to minimize the quantities of biological agents and toxins in the inventory.The organization should demonstrate proactive measures to reduce risk through the elimination, substitution or minimization of volumes/quantities of biological agents and toxins used, and the number of manipulations conducted. Procedures should be in place to investigate potentially missing biological agents.

The organization should ensure that plans address the following needs at a minimum: a. identifying those responsible for devising, implementing and testing the control measures; b. responding during emergencies occurring outside working hours as well as those occurring during normal working hours; c. providing for periods of reduced staff availability (e.g. during weekends and holiday periods); d. ensuring emergency access/exit, including the ability to override access controls as appropriate; e. providing emergency exit routes that avoid evacuating people through containment areas; f. providing for the safe removal, transport, transfer, treatment and accommodation of contaminated persons and objects. CWA 4.4.5.210.3.2 Control measures in place can be demonstrated as being reasonable and proportionate to the scale and nature of the emergency. CWA 4.4.5.210.3.3 Emergency plans are effectively communicated to all employees and relevant third parties, and tested with the goal of making everyone aware of their obligations. In the event of an emergency situation, it may be necessary to involve parties external to the organization. Based on the credible scenarios identified, the organization should pinpoint such agencies to establish their role in responding to a given situation. The organization may choose to sign memoranda of understanding or agreements with key local responders. It may also be necessary to inform and educate such parties on their role and any risk exposures they may face, and ensure their actions will not unnecessarily increase the risk associated with the emergency (e.g. uncontrolled use of water for fires).

Exercises and simulations should be conducted to provide assurance that plans are effective and to learn from any lessons that arise. Exercises should be planned and every effort made to ensure they realistically represent the events simulated. However, such activities should also be conducted under controlled conditions and not be allowed to become a source of risk in their own right. The results of an exercise should be documented and reviewed for lessons learnt, and feedback on performance should be provided to the appropriate personnel. Any resulting actions should be recorded and allocated to named individuals, and measures should be put in place to ensure they are closed out effectively. 10.5 Contingency Plans CWA 4.4.5.410.5.1 In the event of an emergency, adequate contingency measures are in place to ensure the safety and security of continued operations.

Such eventualities should be considered proactively, and contingency plans put in place. Activities should address the need for adequate redundancy, replacement and other measures, which could involve the availability of alternative facilities or personnel, the introduction of backup systems (e.g. power supplies), alternative means of decontaminating materials in the event of the failure of critical systems or equipment (e.g. kill tanks or autoclaves), or the complete safe shutdown of operations in extreme situations. Element 11 - Accident/Incident Investigation The Accident/Incident Investigation element addresses activities that define the facts and circumstances related to an event, determine the causes and develop remedial action to control biorisk and prevent recurrence. Often, chance is the only reason a property-damage accident or near-miss incident does not result in infection or personal harm. Likewise, chance alone often determines whether an accident's consequences are minor, serious or catastrophic. This element examines the organization's reporting and investigation system, whether the right people are involved and how corrective and preventive actions are implemented.

Engineering and operational solutions will be incorporated that are consistent with the risk posed by the properties of the materials to be stored and handled in the facility and the nature of the work to be carried out. CWA 4.4.4.8.112.1.2 The design process identifies and incorporates all relevant legislative requirements, together with information from recognized standards, guidelines, industry good practices and facility-specific risk assessments. The design process should include identifying and reviewing relevant legislation and codes of practice (including building codes as well as those related to laboratory biosafety/laboratory biosecurity) and risk assessments. The requirements identified from these sources should be incorporated into the design plans. The design should be fully documented, including a description of the tests and standards of acceptance to ensure performance. The process should be documented and transparent to provide assurance that it has been comprehensive and thorough. CWA 4.4.4.8.112.1.3 The design process identifies and facilitates consultation with all relevant parties associated with the facility and its operation. The design process should include identifying and consulting with individuals involved in the planning, construction, operation and maintenance of the facility.

The commissioning plan should be developed in detail in parallel with the physical concept to ensure the expectations for the building are measurable. The commissioning plan should clearly identify all the steps from beginning to end, providing examples and including the conditions of acceptance of each step as a prerequisite for proceeding to the next. The commissioning plan should identify all steps required before operation is commenced initially or resumed after any temporary shutdown. The commissioning process should provide the benchmark for acceptable facility operation and the description of the programme to be put in place to maintain that level of performance. The decommissioning process should identify the decontamination procedures and security-related measures that must be in place for the facility's temporary or final shutdown. The decommissioning programme should describe not only the procedures, but also the standards of acceptance when those procedures are performed. This may be documented through clearance certificates and permits to work, which identify when and under what conditions the decommissioned facility can be re-entered. 12.3 Infrastructure and Operational Management CWA 4.4.4.812.3.1 Facilities, equipment and processes are designed and run in a safe and secure way with respect to biorisk management.

This should involve proactive measures to identify vulnerabilities and implementation of effective control and monitoring mechanisms. In planning and conducting security risk assessments, the organization should consider: a. the theft or diversion of biological agents and toxins or related equipment, documents or data; b. sabotage, including vandalism and tampering; c. break-in and intrusion; d. labour issues and disputes; e. weather-related emergencies (e.g. earthquake, tsunami, flood, tornado, hurricane); WHO GLOBAL ACTION PLAN TO MINIMIZE POLIOVIRUS FACILITY-ASSOCIATED RISK (GAPIII) ANNEX 6: BIORISK MANAGEMENT STANDARD FOR SAFE HANDLING OF NEW SAMPLES POTENTIALLY CONTAINING POLIOVIRUS MATERIAL IN POLIOVIRUS-NON-ESSENTIAL FACILITIES 221CWA15793 Clause No.23Biorisk Management Element No.Safe handling of new samples potentially containing poliovirus material in poliovirus-non-essential laboratoriesGuidance 16.3 Personnel Control CWA 4.4.4.7.116.3.1 A personnel reliability policy is defined and implemented. The nature and extent of the measures required for the personnel reliability assessment should be determined as part of the risk assessment process. In some instances, few checks may be required other than collecting employment references, whereas, in others, more in-depth screening may be deemed necessary. CWA 4.4.4.7.116.3.2 The organization ensures that individuals' access to facilities or work is controlled, according to the policy.Where lawful and appropriate as determined by risk assessments, screening may include such checks as identity and immigration status, membership in organizations hostile to biological research, criminal records and financial probity. 16.4 Personal Security CWA 4.4.4.1016.4.1 A policy is in place to provide personal security support services to staff members, including, where appropriate, personal security awareness training. Personal security is concerned with staff security during off- duty hours while away from the facility. During these times, staff members are vulnerable because of their function or position. 16.5 Contractors, Visitors and Suppliers CWA 4.4.4.7.216.5.1 The organization ensures that suppliers, contractors, visitors and subcontractors adhere to the established management systems' requirements and do not compromise the facility's biorisk management.
