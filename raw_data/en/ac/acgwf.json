Stronger chemicals, air and water pollution, radiation and nuclear power, and the food we eat all play a part in the creation of toxicity which can cause irreversible damage to our bodies. There are over 80 thousand man-made chemicals that the human body simply cannot break down\u2014and these toxins can last for several decades in our air, soil, drinking water, and food supply. If toxins stay dormant in our bodies for too long, they can develop into serious health complications and diseases. At our clinic, we offer liver supportive cleanses that can help you take your overall health and well-being back. Liver support/Detox The liver is the detoxifying powerhouse of our bodies. The liver's main assignment is to filter the blood coming from the digestive tract before it travels to the rest of the body. When too many toxins enter the body, the liver has a hard time keeping up causing some toxins to flow through the body. Our clinic offers multiple tests to determine if your liver needs help. Then, we can create a treatment plan that best suits you. We have natural liver support/detox medicines which help support hepatic and GI detoxification by providing nutrients and botanical extracts that help toxin elimination, digestion, intestinal mobility, cell function, and many more. Sometimes a healthy diet, exercise, and living a low-stress life is not enough. If you have any questions about detox or any of our functional medical testing, please give us a call today. "}
