Themes of this nosode and practical uses. | Cristina Villacorta", "sitename": "Cristina Villacorta", "date": "2022-07-06", "cleaned_text": "We will have a look at Carcinosin, and its homeopathy uses Miasms are inherited predispositions to disease or states that are present in our bodies and can become active at different points in our lives. Carcinosin is one of my favourite homeopathic remedies in my practice that I often prescribe, one with many uses and a remedy that I find very easy to spot. However, I have often heard patients say they are concerned or scared about this homeopathic remedy. I feel this is because of their association between this particular nosode and the original source. However, there is nothing to fear when working with this remedy; this is a gentle and lovely remedy that is very valuable in the present times and helps with many symptoms, emotional as well as physical. To understand a bit more about this nosode and its uses, we need to understand its foundations and how it is framed from the physical to the emotional side of the remedy. On a physical sphere, Carcinosin has a strong affinity to the immune system, the part in our bodies that defends us from intruders such as viruses and bacteria. The immune system, which is our gatekeeper, searches for things that are foreign to us and protects us from them; our immunity is based on well-defined boundaries into what belongs to our body and what is foreign to us. The main theme of this remedy is BOUNDARIES. When our body is out of balance needing this remedy, our immune systems cannot clearly define what belongs to us and what is foreign. In this way, it attacks our body in the same way that it does any foreign material giving rise to all kinds of chronic inflammations, fevers and autoimmune problems, chronic allergies, viral infections and even chronic skin problems such as Psoriasis. On the mental level, the Carcinosin patient is unable to develop clear boundaries that lead to a sense of healthy identity and self-esteem. No wonder the Banerjies have found this remedy helpful at some point in most of their cancer cases and some other protocols to boost immunity. [ Learn more about the Banerji Protocols here.](https://cristinavillacorta.com/blog/the-banerji-protocols-some-philosophical-aspects) Carcinosin is a remedy that lacks a definition of internal boundaries; therefore, it is very much affected by anything external coming in as an attack on the system. This can be in the form of an emotional external event such as grief or a physical attack such as any kind of toxicity in our body that affects our immunity and how our body handles the detoxification of those substances. So this remedy is very helpful for issues arising from any drug toxicity, such as hormones, vaccinations, or excess drugs. It is often used to boost the immune system to get rid of offending substances, and it is part of [many detox protocols ](https://cristinavillacorta.com/blog/helping-the-digestive-system-liver-support)that have been used successfully in homeopathy. The Banerjies use this remedy in arrested development, such as in the Autism protocol. As the rise in autism cases has been linked to the amount of toxic material loaded in a child's organism, such as aluminium adjuvants which are thought to cause systematic brain inflammation, this remedy in their protocol in one of their lines makes complete sense as one of the possible options to address one of the layers in that complex disease. [The Banerjies also use this remedy for PANDAS](https://cristinavillacorta.com/blog/vaccines-and-recurrent-chronic-complains-in-children) which stands for Paediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder, again another use of this remedy in autoimmune problems. So what are the building blocks of Carcinosin from a more classical approach? Let's look at the most obvious themes and how it is represented on the rubrics of the repertory, which are the headings that point us to this remedy. By studying the rubrics, we can start to build a picture of their characteristics, giving us an idea of their behaviour. INTERNAL CHAOS Carcinosin has internal turmoil, chaos, disorganisation, and a sense of wildness. The Carcinosin person internally lacks self-control and is in a state of wildness. This is represented by the rubrics: Mind: wildness Mind: chaotic Also, the unconscious comes to the dreams in the form of distress: Dreams: devils Dreams: frightful Dreams: nightmares The fear is directed at things that can act out of control and threaten them. Mind: Fear of cancer Mind: Fear of impending disease Mind: Fear of cancer Mind: Fear in a crowded street Mind: Fear of impending disease CONTROL This internal state causes the individual to try to compensate externally by controlling everything. Strong self-control emerges, and they also develop the need to control their environment leading to perfectionism. This is represented by an obsession which may lean toward healthy eating, body image, exercise, cleanliness, tidiness, order, work, helping others, etc Mind: fastidious Mind: desire for harmony Mind: occupation amel Mind: order, desire for Mind: rest, cannot rest when things are not in the proper place Mind: industrious Mind: self-control, increased Mind: anger about his mistakes However, perfectionism is an impossible task to be achieved and Carsinosin people feel that strain. Trying to be perfect is impossible and this is the task faced by people needing this remedy. The state encompasses the feeling of trying to achieve something impossible for humans. Mind: delusions, superhuman control is under Mind: delusions, influence one is under a powerful The person has the feeling of performing a task that has never ended and can not be completed, but still, they insist on keeping up with it, which becomes a fixation. Dreams: exhausting Dreams: searching someone; for, failing to find him, and Dreams: work, night, treats patients, whole Mind: too much sense of duty Mind: obstinate Nevertheless, controlling the outside is no more than a projection of trying to maintain calm in a sea of turmoil. Internally, there is a strong need to be free, to be different from how you are acting and the need to break free in Carcinosin is expressed as: Mind: change, desire for, life in Mind: travelling desire for ANXIETY Carcinosin people are full of anticipatory anxiety because they know that the task they have set themselves is too high. That sense of striving for perfection is, in time, striving to achieve the unachievable and, as a result, affects their self-esteem. Any task has to be done to perfection, and they feel unsure if they can perform it or not if it will be good enough or not. This makes them sensitive to criticism from other people as that is a sign of imperfection. Mind: anxiety, about his family and others, if a time is set Mind: ailments from, anticipation Mind: anxiety, future about Mind: conscience, anxiety of Dreams: danger, death of Dreams: misfortune SUPPRESSION Their internal chaos is compensated with a state of control. As they need to conform to others, they are constantly adapting. By adapting, you may have to compromise in leaving behind something that you may like or need, creating feelings of sacrifice. Mind: suppressing his desires Mind: resignation Mind: yielding disposition Mind: will, weakness of Mind: polite, too polite Mind: delusions, small, body is smaller Mind: delusions, martyr, of being a REBELLION In homeopathy, we often find polarities within the same remedy. They are both expressions of the same axis. The opposite of conforming is to rebel, which is a position that Carcinosin may display at some point. This is somehow seen more in children than adults, and maybe because children are less compensated than adults. Adults have adapted and conformed to the rest of society as a way to blend in, to integrate, although their inner feelings may be very different from how they are presented externally. Children tend to act more freely as they have not yet developed the adult needs to be integrated into a wider group. The smaller the child, the less social integration is needed. In children up to 2 and \u00bd years of age, their main social group may be mother, father and siblings, which provides unconditional love, regardless of behaviour. Children, in general, do not care if some behaviour is socially accepted or not, so rebellion to control can be more freely expressed. Adults have conformed for too long, and the desire to break free has been suppressed for too long. Mind: children, temper tantrums Mind: anger, children in, Mind: dictatorial Mind: destructiveness Mind: disobedience ARTISTIC LOVE OF MUSIC AND DANCE Many people talk about expressing themselves freely when painting, dancing or making a sculpture. For Carcinosin, art is a way of releasing part of what has been suppressed; it is an outlet. The love of music and dancing involves rhythm and coordinated movement. In a wild estate, there is no coordination; chaos is an unformed, disorganised mass. Art is an expression, the opposite of suppression. Mind: dancing, love to Mind: art, ability for Mind: music, desire for SENSITIVE Carcinosin people are known to be very sensitive to animals and people. This is one of the biggest grief remedies in our Materia Medica. As the boundaries are not well adjusted, this gives rise to lots of permeability merging with others' feelings and emotions and being greatly affected by others' actions. This part of the state arises as to the realisation that to be accepted, true nature must be suppressed, hence the love for animals that love us regardless of anything. Their inner love for themselves has also been suppressed and therefore is projected onto the external environment. Animals give us unconditional love, the love and support that Carcinosin people may have missing. The love for nature in this remedy could be explained as searching for harmony. Creation is organised opposite to their inner chaotic state. Mind: cheerful when thunders and lighten Mind: anxiety, health about, relatives of Mind: sympathetic Mind: nature, loves Mind: animals, love of animals It is quite amazing to see how the themes of this remedy merge from the physical to the emotional plane and how easy it is to be able to recognise it. This remedy is very important in these times as individuality and self-expression are becoming more infrequent in our society. We all must look and be the same to feel accepted or loved. Carcinosin mimics a bit of everyone to blend in, and in the same way, this remedy can look like small incomplete aspects of other remedies in our materia medica which are complementary or related to this Natrum-mur, Arsenicum, Pulsatilla, Medorrinum and Syphilinum. Sometimes, it acts as an umbrella holding the other remedies underneath. Again, it mimics a bit of each of these remedies in the same way that the person adapts to their environment to fit in. Our present society has moved from the Tubercular miasm characterised by self-expression and creativity into the Cancer miasm mainly fuelled by suppression. That is why Carcinosin and Tuberculinum are remedies that we often see one after another, and after prescribing Carcinosin, often some of the other related remedies come alive in the patient giving us an indication of the deeper workings of this remedy in action.
