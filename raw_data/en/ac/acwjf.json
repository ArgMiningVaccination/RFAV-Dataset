If the booster is even one day late the vaccine will only be considered effective for 1 year. (This protocol is set forth by the state of Massachusetts.) - Once a 3-year vaccine is given then all consecutive vaccines will be considered effective for 3 years. Distemper Parvo (DHPP-PV): Helps to protect against most stomach viruses including Distemper, Hepatitis, Parainfluenza and Parvo Virus. - This vaccine is administered in a series of 2-4 vaccinations up to 20 weeks - After the original puppy series, the next vaccine administered in 1 year will be good for 3 years. Bordatella (Kennel Cough): Helps to protect against Kennel Cough. This is given to dogs that are going to be in highly social dog settings, like doggy daycare, boarding and grooming facilities. - This vaccine is administered by injection or an intranasal \"mist\". The injectable vaccine is given in a two-part series occurring 3-4 weeks apart, and can then be given annually. If administered intranasally only one dose is given and then annually as needed. - Note: Some animal care facilities require the kennel cough booster every 6 months. Canine Influenza H3N8/H3N2: Helps protect against the \"dog flu\" which causes respiratory infections. - This vaccine is administered in a two-part series occurring 2-4 weeks apart, and then boostered annually. - Although we do not routinely administer this vaccine at this time, some grooming, boarding, day-care and related facilities require this vaccine. Lyme Vaccine: Helps to protect against Lyme disease which is transmitted to dogs by infected deer ticks. - This vaccine is administered in a two-part series occurring 2-3 weeks apart, and then boostered annually. - This vaccine is optional and is typically given to dogs that have a high exposure to tick-infested areas. We recommend that you discuss this vaccine with your veterinarian. - The first defense against Lyme disease is a good tick preventative. - Click [here](http://tickencounter.org)for more information on ticks. Leptospirosis: Helps to protect against a bacterial disease that can affect the kidney and liver. - This disease is spread by standing water that has been contaminated with the Leptospirosis bacteria, via urine. - This vaccine is administered in a two-part series occurring 3-4 weeks apart, and then boostered annually. - We recommend that you discuss this vaccine with your veterinarian. Fecal samples: Rules out intestinal parasites and worms. - We typically deworm puppies at each puppy visit, it is common for intestinal parasites to be passed to pups in-utero. - An annual fecal is recommended to ensure that no intestinal parasites (some of which live microscopically in the soil) were picked up over the year. - Throughout your dog's life, will suggest a fecal exam if your dog is in intestinal distress. Many of these parasites can and will cause diarrhea. - MOST OF THESE PARASITES DO NOT POSE A THREAT TO PEOPLE. We encourage you to discuss concerns with your veterinarian. Heartworm: Heartworms are transmitted by mosquitoes and, once mature, they live in the heart and large blood vessels of the lungs. - We follow the American Heartworm Association's recommendation of heartworm prevention to be given year round to prevent infection. - Annual testing is recommended. - If you choose to stop over the cold weather months a heartworm test must be run 6 months after the first skipped dose to ensure that the patient did not become infected over the winter. - Click [here](https://www.atlanticveterinaryhospital.com/heartworm) "}
