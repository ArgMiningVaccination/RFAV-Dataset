These toxins are found everywhere: in our food, water and air. Many of these chemicals \"build up\" and concentrate in our bodies. Toxins specifically concentrate in body fat and organs such as the liver, kidneys and the brain. They are also transferred to our children and future generations through our genes. Increased exposure to toxins can lead to many problems with the immune system, nervous system and endocrine system. It can even lead to environmental illnesses. Some of the most common complaints of toxic burden include: - Chronic fatigue - Headache and brain fog - Sensitivities and allergies to foods, chemicals as well as personal care and household products Depending on the extent of exposure or the individual's capacity to tolerate it, toxicity can lead to more serious illnesses. These illnesses include: - Cancer - Fibromyalgia - Autism - ADHD - Heart disease - Neurological complications Our Environmental Impact At Thornhill Naturopathic Health Clinic, we care about our impact on the environment and the effect that toxins in our environment have on our health. Our state-of-the-art clinic has been designed with non-toxic, low or no VOC paints, flooring, cabinets and furnishings. Insulation in the walls is a manufactured product made from recycled blue jeans, which is non-toxic and mould-resistant. We use energy efficient lighting which does not contain mercury found in conventional fluorescent lights. Our HVAC, hot water heating and appliances all meet Energy Star energy efficiency criteria. We have a scent-free policy at our clinic to reduce exposure to aromatic toxins. Our clinic has reduced our EMF radiation exposure by choosing not to have WI-FI. We have also reduced our use of paper by moving to a paperless electronic patient filing system. Our patients' health and comfort are our priorities. Reducing our impact on the environment is our passion. How do you treat environmental illness and detoxification? Environmental illness and detoxification treatments are designed based on individual patients. Factors that are considered include: exposure, toxic burden load and specific genetic and lifestyle factors, nutrient issues and the patient's goals. Treatment options may include: - Intravenous therapy - Infra-red sauna therapy - Specific naturopathic nutrient supplement and detoxification protocols - Allergen desensitization protocols. - Low Dose Immunotherapy/Antigen (LDA) for food, chemical and environmental allergies and sensitivities What is Low Dose Antigen (LDA)? Low Dose Antigen is used to treat inhalants, food, and chemical sensitivities and intolerances. It trains the immune system to reduce its reactivity to particular antigens. Mode of Action: - The proposed mode of action of LDA is through regulating the production of immune cells that induce \"tolerance.\" - The treatment must be done only once every 2 months. Over time, it can be stretched out to every 3-4 months. - The body will become desensitized after 15-18 treatments. After this occurs, \"booster\" doses are given annually/bi-annually to maintain the desensitization. Symptoms and conditions that LDA can treat include: - Low energy, allergies, asthma, chronic fatigue, arthritis, autoimmune diseases - Allergic rhinitis, seasonal allergies, bronchitis, ear issues, or frequent ear infections - Food allergy and food sensitivities, - Skin eczema, dermatitis, psoriasis, hives - Migraines, headaches - Multiple chemical sensitivities - Brain fog, confusion - Ulcerative colitis - Hyperactivity, ADHD, Autism - Candida Find more "}
