With summer and its sweltering days upon us, what is better than a BIG bowl of homemade ice cream? Cranking out fresh ice cream goes back two generations in my family. My mom and dad grew up making it with their parents. Back in the day, they would only make ice cream during the winter because they did not have ice available on their families' farms. Both of my parents have continued the ice cream tradition with our family. Of course, we can now create delicious fl avors year-round. In the beginning, we used a manual crank model with a wooden barrel. But that method gets harder to accomplish as the ice cream freezes and hardens. So we upgraded to the ease of modern equipment. My wife, Melissa, and I continue this great family tradition. Ice cream gets prepared by the bucketful for birthdays, holidays and much, much more. I hope my children will one day have their kids follow our footsteps. I would really love to share our family recipe, but it's a secret! The focus of this issue is food, and ice cream is just one of the feature dishes. The food theme helps us introduce chef Curtis Stone (shown on the cover), who has joined the Hy-Vee te am to create recipes for you.

Now, he's joining with Hy-Vee to help you create meals that are naturally good, easy to make and exciting for your family and friends. Bon app\u00e9tit, mate! TEXT STEVE COOPER PHOTOGRAPHY PRESTON MACK AND TOBIN BENNETT Dishing It Up : Curtis Stone 4 seasons summer 2011 04-13 Curtis Stone LO12.indd 4 5/11/11 2:38 PMThirteen years ago, a footloose Australian lad backpacking his way through Europe walked in the back door of an upper-crust London restaurant and asked for a job. Curtis Stone stepped into a future that would take him from kitchen help to executive chef to interna-tional TV star. Now, he is teaming with Hy-Vee. Fresh from culinary training in his hometown of Melbourne, Curtis had been hired at London's renowned Caf\u00e9 Royal. At age 22, he was young enough to be giddy and amazed by the break. His rise to the top began at the bottom. His first task was standing at a refrigera-tor for hours, selecting lettuce leaves one-by-one and carefully washing them for salads. \"I was the donkey of the kitchen,\" he said, relaxing between takes at a recent photo shoot for Hy-Vee. \"I'd get the really awful jobs that no one else would want.\" Curtis was half a world away from home. One of the only things he knew about his new boss, Marco Pierre White, was his bad reputation. Despite a brilliant career, White was widely regarded as the industry's enfant terrible. The master chef had the surly look of a mobster and his temper was a tornado. But he could conjure dishes so elegant that they left fortunate diners enraptured. Smiling at the memory of his start, the 35-year-old Curtis recalls, \"Everything was fan- cier than I'd ever seen. You know, they had bottles of wine on the list that went for 30,000 pounds apiece. That's about $70,000. Yet people would come in and order them.\" The demands were great and his mentor would not suffer incompetence; Curtis devoted himself to learning. Having spent three years in an Australian culinary arts college that required extensive on-the-job training in local restaurants, he'd come to White's table with a few fundamentals in his kit. But London was the big leagues, and a little schooling back home was a pretty modest r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \"All of the chefs were French or British, but most of the British had spent time working in France. So it was tough for me,\" he says. Curtis dug in and did the work. He mastered the lettuce leaves, baking, cutting and even learned to create perfects swirls of jelly required for fanciful nouvelle-cuisine presenta-tions. As his skills grew and he kept the right attitude, Curtis won his boss' confidence. By the end of his third year, he was promoted to executive chef in White's flagship London restaurant, Quo Vadis. The new title came with new opportunities. Curtis was one of a dozen chefs who contributed to a very successful cookbook, London on a Plate. Then another door opened. He heard from an agent. Would Curtis like to do some television spots? seasons hy-vee.com 5 04-13 Curtis Stone LO12.indd 5 5/12/11 10:08 AMGETTING TO KNOW CURTIS The woman in Curtis' life is American television actress Lindsay Price. The Russell Crowe boxing movie Cinderella Man can move him to tears. He played semi-pro Australian football and long held the ambition to suit up for the Geelong Cats of the Australian Football League. Favorite television show? Modern Family. Favorite reality series? The Biggest Loser. Favorite city to dine in? Chicago. He has a weakness for tacos and is a regular at taco stands around Los Angeles. Don't off er him processed, imitation or modi ed foods. In January, Curtis threw an oceanside party and barbecue for Oprah Winfrey on a pristine Australian beach. Sir Paul McCartney off ered high praise after Curtis prepared a fabulous meal for him in London. \"I want you to learn that you don't have to spend hour upon hour in the kitchen to have a great meal. The cooking experience should not be a chore but actually something that you enjoy and look forward to doing.\" \"Hy-V ee's partnership with Curtis Stone came about because we share the same passion for making mealtime a celebration of food, family and fun.\" \u2014Randy Edeker, President and CEO of Hy-V ee 6 seasons summer 2011 04-13 Curtis Stone LO12.indd 6 5/11/11 2:38 PM \"As a teenager, I worked in my mum's floral shop, which wasn't the coolest thing to do as a young guy. But it taught me a lot about color and composition and how to put a plate together. I learned how to set a table. My mum was sort of house proud and all that together became part of my cooking experience.\"Curtis Stone and his mother, Lorraine, relax during one of his frequent trips home to Melbourne, Australia.With his rugged good looks and talent in the kitchen, it was prob ably inevitable that television producers would come calling. It turned out he was the perfect TV chef. Men wanted to take him out for a beer; women wanted to take him home. One thing led to another and he was soon offered his own show. \"Can you imagine that you're young and some guy calls to say he wants to pay you a year's salary to go back to Australia to travel around surfing and cooking for two months and all of it will be filmed? Yes, I'm in!,\" he says, almost jumping from his seat. It wasn't long before he was cre- ating cookbooks and launching new television shows. He even made People Magazine's \"Sexiest Man Alive\" issue in 2006. Currently he's partner-ing with celebrity chef Bobby Flay as a judge on the new NBC series Amer-ica's Next Great Restaurant. He's also the host of the Bravo television show Top Chef Masters. seasons hy-vee.com 7 04-13 Curtis Stone LO12.indd 7 5/11/11 2:38 PM \"With Hy-Vee, we are developing a wide variety of recipes. Some are more family oriented and some a little more challenging. The key is to have something for everybody. Some will be really affordable and budget conscious; some more adventurous.\" 8 seasons summer 2011 04-13 Curtis Stone LO12.indd 8 5/11/11 2:39 PMCurtis is much more than a hot TV chef. Yes, he's so engaging he could charm the pouch off a kangaroo. But he knows his stuff. He is a hardworking foodie, who has proven he can stand the heat of a restaurant kitchen. GROWING UP DOWN UNDER To understand Curtis better, imagine growing up in Melbourne, a lovely seaside city on the southern coast of Australia. Born in 1975, he was the middle child with an older brother and younger sister. His single mother, Lorraine, ran a modest home and small florist shop in a working-class neighborhood, and Curtis speaks of her with warmth and affection. His mother and father, Bryan, split when Curtis was very young. \"I came from an interesting family,\" Curtis says. \"Because my grandparents were quite wealthy, I went to a really nice school, a private school. But my parents weren't particu-larly well off. I can still remember my mum cutting around patterns. She sewed our clothes. Mum came from a very humble beginning.\" To help with expenses, Lorraine taught the kids to grow vegetables and raise chickens. Curtis plucked more than a few, though eggs were the primary purpose of the small flock. \"My uncle was from the country, so he'd take my brother and me out in the fields to catch rabbits. I grew up in a kind of natural environment,\" he says. \"If you pull carrots out of the ground and are familiar with taking game at a young age, you start having an appreciation for these natural foods.\" Such experiences shaped the natural-food philosophy that he espouses today. His school offered a British-style education and was the kind of place where there was frequent reason for boys to break out their formal, navy blue school uniforms. The blazer jackets carried the traditional school crest and ties had to be knotted just-so. Asked what kind of a student he was, Curtis reacts with a laugh. \"To be honest, I would rather have done something else. I was a pretty creative child, but not the brightest. I did OK, really. But I was more focused around playing, though I paid attention to business subjects,\" he says. After the equivalent of high school, Curtis' father encour- aged him to pursue a career in accounting. But Curtis had food on his mind. He enrolled in a four-year catering manage-ment program, which required him to apprentice four days a week in a local restaurant and attend classes one day a week. He worked in top Australian restaurants, including a year seasons hy-vee.com 9 04-13 Curtis Stone LO12.indd 9 5/11/11 2:39 PMas a butcher at Melbourne's Savoy Hotel. At the same time, he enrolled in another college to learn culinary arts\u2014two goals, two colleges. He wanted to study the business of running a restaurant while also becoming a qualified chef. His interest in cooking had grown through years of helping his mother in the kitchen and from making Yorkshire fudge with his grandmother. \"Granny was my dad's mum and she was from Yorkshire in England,\" Curtis says. \"Her fudge is very simple. It's made with milk and sugar and graham crackers. I remember as a little kid with Granny when she started having me measure out the half-cup sugar and helping.\" PHILOSOPHY OF FOOD AND LIFE It wasn't just making fudge, growing vegetables or time spent with his mother in the kitchen that drew Curtis to cooking. It was something deeper about how food and life intersected. As much as he loved his mother's baking, he was attracted even more by how she made an event out of a simple meal. Days ended at home around the dinner table. While he and his siblings ate, Lorraine also encouraged them to talk. \"We would play a game my mum called 'Best and Worst.' My brother, sister and I would have to say what was the best thing that happened during the day and what was the worst. By the time you went around the table, you'd spent nearly an hour and a half talking to each other.\" This family activity shaped one of Curtis' core beliefs.\"Chefs take themselves way too seriously,\" he says. \"What we really do is put meals together as a way for people to have a really beautiful experience together.\" It's all about family and friends. \"Everyone comes home, you smell something great and you appreciate that someone has gathered all the ingredients you like. Sitting around the dinner table, you share your day. \"There's a big difference between that experience and sitting in front of a TV eating out of a box that someone picked up on the way home. The two are similar\u2014both are about feeding your family. But one is much more important,\" he says. 10 seasons summer 2011 04-13 Curtis Stone LO12.indd 10 5/11/11 2:40 PM \"I am an everyday cook. I cook all the time for myself, my friends and my family. I think that if you cook with what comes out of the ground instead of what comes out of a packet, you're in a pretty good space.\" seasons hy-vee.com 11 04-13 Curtis Stone LO12.indd 11 5/11/11 2:40 PMIn his early media days, he thought his job was to teach home cooks how to turn out classic European dish- es. But after some experience, he has adjusted his initial ideas about what cooking advice people really need. He had to think less about serving the clientele at Quo Vadis and more about a common household. \"When I did Take Home Chef, that was a real eye opener,\" he says. \"I had to learn that it is one thing to know some things about food, but another thing altogether to understand what people are faced with when they cook for their families. When you see a mother with a three-year-old who is screaming around the house and a six-month-old on her arm, you have to give her recipes that are simpler and much more approachable.\" TEAMING WITH HY-VEE As he partners with Hy-Vee over the next few years, Curtis hopes that readers of Hy-Vee Seasons gain from his experiences. His goal is to offer recipes that fit everyday life and help families draw closer as they engage around their meals. He also hopes that customers are as enthu-siastic about the store as he is. \"The first time I was in a Hy-Vee, I had just darted in to pick up some extra ingredients for a dish,\" he says. \"Wow, what a grocery store! You know, you think that this is the middle of the country and you won't have access to all you can get in LA or some other big city. But I was blown away just walking down the produce aisle.\" He also discovered a store that had a set of values similar to his own. \"I love that Hy-Vee focuses on local farming and sea- sonality. And the fact that they have nutritionists in their stores is great. This matches with their core values about food and family. It's not all about just selling you every-thing. It's important to give you the tools to live healthy, sustainable lives,\" he says. Readers will also gain a fresh perspective about what to put in their shopping carts. \"I wish I could take every customer shopping. I want to grab you by the hand and say, 'OK, what do you want? Let me help you select the right ingredients and serve the right dinner.' But I can't do that. What I can do is give you recipes that are developed around limiting ingredi-ents and limiting complex cooking techniques. I'm also mindful of the time it will take to prepare. In the end, my promise is that you'll love the taste.\" 12 seasons summer 2011 04-13 Curtis Stone LO12.indd 10:09 AMTHE CHEF'S MEDIA MENU Curtis Stone's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of various books and television shows has made his name and face recognizable all over the world.

TEXT LOIS WHITE PHOTOGRAPHY TOBIN BENNETT TOMATOES 14 seasons summer 2011 14-23 Tomatoes LO5.indd 14 5/11/11 2:44 PMThat first bite of a fresh succulent tomato is the best. The warm juice trickles down your chin as a delightful explosion of flavor awakens your taste buds. Head to your Hy-Vee produce sec-tion and you'll find a whole slew of the multicolored beauties bursting with flavor and begging to be eaten.

They're also among the most nutritious foods you'll find for your summer meals. Tomatoes were a health food before that term was coined. A RAINBOW OF HEALTH BENEFITS Nutrition experts like to refer to tomatoes as a nutrient-dense food. \"We use the term nutrient-dense because tomatoes provide vitamins, minerals and other substances that have positive health effects with relatively few calories,\" says Jen Haugen, above, who is a registered dietitian for the Austin, Minnesota, Hy-Vee store. Red and orange fruits and vegetables, along with dark greens, beans and peas, are excellent for helping reduce the risk of many chronic diseases. Tomatoes have long been recommended for their nutritional value in the United States Department of Agriculture Dietary Guidelines, commonly called the food pyramid. Rich in potassium and low in sodium, tomatoes are ideal for a heart-healthy diet. Such diets have been shown to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease. Tomatoes also contain abundant beta-carotene, which promotes healthy skin, and vitamin C for a stronger immune system. Because tomatoes are frequently handled, they may look clean but harbor bacteria on the skin. Thoroughly clean and rinse so you don't transfer bacteria when cutting and eating. POWER OF COOKED TOMATOES While eating fresh tomatoes is healthful, cooking them also turns out to have great benefit. When cooked, tomatoes release lycopene, a pow-erful antioxidant that works with other vitamins and minerals to help protect against certain types of cancer, including prostate cancer. Lycopene may also offer cardiovascular and anti-inflammatory protection. How much more lycopene can you get from a cooked tomato compared to eating it raw? \"About ten times more,\" Jen says. While a cup of raw tomatoes has about 4.6 milligrams of lycopene, a cup of cooked contains anywhere from 50 to 70 milligrams, depending on the variety and season. Although lycopene is present inside the cell walls of fresh tomatoes, it's not until the walls are broken down during cooking that it's released and can be absorbed in the body. The heat alters the lycopene's molecular structure, making it two to three times easier for the body to absorb than in the raw state. YOUR DAILY TOMATO Red and yellow tomatoes also contain vitamin C, but a red tomato has about three times more than the yellow. Higher in sodium, yellow tomatoes also contain more niacin and folate than common reds. \"If you include a variety of tomato colors in your diet, you'll get a variety of essential nutrients to keep your body strong and healthy,\" says Jen. Serve an assortment of tomatoes\u2014heirlooms for salads, Romas for grilling and sauce, and beefsteaks the size of a softball for fresh tomato sandwiches. Jen says, \"Toss any of these varieties into a saut\u00e9 or pasta salad and you'll taste a bit of summer sun-shine in every bite.\" seasons hy-vee.com 15 14-23 Tomatoes LO5.indd 15 5/11/11 2:44 PMBOUNTIFUL PICKINGS Here are just a few types of tomatoes\u2014 along with their best uses\u2014that you'll discover at your local Hy-Vee store. \"Get a locally grown ripe tomato, lovely and sweet. Without having to cook, chop it up, mix it with mozzarella cheese and balsamic vinegar. Tear in fresh basil. Beautiful.\" ROMA These tomatoes are generally oblong, often egg- shaped. Romas, a well-known variety, usually have fewer seeds, less juice and a more concentrated flavor. Good for a fresh sauce. GRAPES Available in shades of red and yellow, these bite-size tomatoes are packed with flavor and sweet tomato juice. Perfect for snacking. ON-THE-VINE Medium-to-large-size tomatoes, these make gorgeous slices for topping burgers and deli sandwiches. CHERRIES Prolific tomatoes, these may be round or pear-shaped and range in color from yellow to red. A standout variety, Sungold, above, balances citrusy tartness with hints of sweet grape, orange and floral flavors. Use in salads, on bruschetta or as an appetizer with a dip.HEIRLOOMS These varieties offer a range of tastes, shapes and textures. Color is often an indicator of flavor. Red or pink varieties have a classic tomato flavor, yellow and orange varieties have a sweet flavor, purple varieties have a smoky sweet flavor and green varieties are both sweet and tart. Let the taste determine the use. GREENHOUSE Fresh vine-ripened tomatoes such as these have a fresh flavor and are great for slicing or using in salads.

Serve an assortment of tomatoes topped with chives and snipped fresh herbs. Drizzle it all with bottled balsamic vinegar. 2. Chop tomatoes into salsa to enhance grilled pork, chicken or fish. Mix 1\u00bd cups diced toma-toes; 1 cup chopped seeded cucumber; \u00bd cup chopped red onion; 1 finely chopped, seeded jalape\u00f1o pepper and \u00bc teaspoon salt. 3. Rub or brush a few tomato halves with olive oil. Sprinkle with sea salt or your favorite fresh herb. Toss tomato on the grill. Thin skewers work great for cherry tomatoes. The goal is to color and soft-en tomatoes a bit without turning them to mush. 4. Try this fun new twist on BLTs. Hollow out large tomatoes and fill the remaining shells with a mixture of chopped romaine, crispy bacon and crunchy croutons. Top with chipotle mayonnaise. 5. Mix tomato wedges with chunks of watermelon. Sprinkle with feta cheese and snipped fresh mint for a refreshing summer salad. 6. Stuff sandwiches with slices of juicy, firm beef- steak tomatoes along with lettuce and alfalfa sprouts or shredded broccoli. 7. Oven-roast tomatoes to intensify their natural flavor and sweetness. Coat cut tomatoes with olive oil and sprinkle with salt, pepper and/or herbs. Place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Roast in a 450\u00b0F oven until skins shrivel and start to brown (about 20 to 30 minutes). If you prefer sweet tomatoes, omit the seasonings and sprinkle with sugar after roasting for 20 minutes, then continue roasting so the sugar caramelizes. 8. Drop a few Roma tomatoes into a pot and sim- mer to a velvety sauce. Add garlic, herbs, crushed red pepper and sea salt to taste. Serve over meat-balls, pasta, cooked shrimp, chicken Parmesan or baked fish fillets. 9. Grab a handful of grape or cherry tomatoes for a healthy snack or toss some into a pasta salad. 10.

Jen also enjoys taking son, Riley, age 7, and daughter, Emma, age 6, (all shown here) to the Hy-Vee produce department. She helps them pick out different shapes, sizes and colors of tomatoes to serve with their family meals. \"I also think it's important to offer tomatoes in fun ways. Activities like this are what get kids interested in eating right,\" she says. Tomatoes-on-a-stick is a simple snack that the Haugen children enjoy making and eating. They skewer cherry or grape tomatoes with cut up string cheese, sliced DiLusso turkey and pimento-stuffed olives, then dip their snack into a light ranch dressing.KID-APPROVED TOMATOES 20 seasons summer 2011 14-23 Tomatoes LO5.indd 20 5/12/11 10:11 AMIt's a real treat for kids to make their own pizzas once in a while.

Sure, there were artificially ripened imports, but the pric e was high and the tomatoes were short on flavor. Fortunately times have chang ed. Nowadays you can savor great-tasting, pesticide-free tomatoes at your local Hy-Vee whenever you want. Several growers and suppliers in the area have developed hydroponic greenhouse operations for raising tomatoes. With hydroponics, crops are grown in water instead of soil. This allows tomatoes to be sold in the Hy-Vee produce department from April through December. One such operation is Graddy's in Carroll, Iowa. John and Kay Gradoville, above, got into the business and made their first tomato shipment to Hy-Vee in 1999. \"We both had the gardening bug and found the hydroponic tomatoes where we lived in Pennsylvania to be very tasty,\" says Kay. \"So when an opportunity came up to purchase a greenhouse, we returned to our hometown of Carroll and started growing a handful of varieties.\" The couple started with a small operation th at has grown steadily. They now have more than an acre of greenhouse space, allowing them to grow about 9,000 plants. Hydroponics is a fairly complicated process of growing tomatoes in a soilless, controlled FRESH OFF THE VINE environment. At Graddy's, plants are brought into the greenhouses about mid-December so the first tomatoes can be harvested around mid-March. When their season begins, new plants are set into growing cubes or bags. Fertilizer, water and nutrients are sent directly to the roots through a carefully controlled irrigation system. This allows the plants to grow and mature 30 to 50 percent faster than soil plants. It also ensures a higher yield and better quality tomatoes. Temperature, light and humidity are precisely controlled in the greenhouses during the growing process, and bees are shipped in to help with pollination. Like other tomato growers, the Gradovilles know that delivering fresh, flavorful tomatoes to Hy-Vee is essential. \"We allow the sun to ripen the tomatoes on the vine as long as we can so flavors develop naturally. Once tomatoes are picked, we have them delivered to the stores within a day or two,\" says Kay. The market for hydroponic tomatoes continues to grow as more consumers recognize the rewards of buying consistent, high-quality tomatoes, even if it's in mid-December. When choosing tomatoes, the Gradovilles suggest going for ones that are heavy for their size and not overly soft. The skin of the tomato should not wrinkle when you run your thumb on it with slight pressure. You can also tell the freshness by the intense tomato aroma, especially at the stem end.

A 100-mile detour seems perfectly reasonable if the reward at the end of your travel is a memorable blue-plate special. These are meals you will tell your friends about. Imagine entering a diner where snappy, happy doo-wop blasts from the jukebox. Smoke rises from the grill and the atmosphere is as mouth-watering as the scent of fries. It's heavenly\u2014so are the sandwiches. The main event may be a tangy mound of savory North Carolina barbecue served as an open-face sandwich. Somewhere underneath the impossibly tender meat is a bun, but finding it takes work. Others might motor to Florida for an authentic Cuban sandwich with roast pork, ham and salami. And there are more great tastes wherever you go. 24 seasons summer 2011 24-33 Sandwich LO7.indd 24 5/12/11 8:23 AMInspired by some of the best diner food in America, here are six amazing sandwiches for you to make at home. This is no baloney. These meals-on-a-bun are big, overfl owing, crunchy, sweet, tart and mouthwatering. Don't thank us now. Just dig in. TEXT STEVE COOPER PHOTOGRAPHY ADAM ALBRIGHT, TOBIN BENNETT AND ANDY LYONS seasons hy-vee.com 25 24-33 Sandwich LO7.indd 25 5/11/11 2:50 PMFortunately, there's no need for pulling out the travel maps to find your dream diner. You can put together your own great American sandwich at home from one of our six regional recipes. Sample them all as you take a road trip without packing a bag or paying at the pump. Everyone at your table will share in this journey of discovery. There's no \"right way\" to make the most of this fare, as anyone who eats at out-of-the-way spots discovers. We've put our spin on each sandwich and so can you. Here's what's on the bill: Louisiana Spicy Chicken Po'Boy. One story has it that this sandwich was introduced as Oyster Loaves in an 1838 cookbook. Others say po'boys originated during a New Orleans transit strike in 1929. T wo brothers with a French Quarter restaurant served roast beef and gravy sandwiches to striking \"poor boys\" for a nickle. Soon, the po'boys were offered with sausage, chicken, fish, fried oysters, fried shrimp, catfish or whatever was available. It's a one-handed meal made to order. North Carolina Pulled-Pork Sandwich. For incredible results, experienced grillers use a pork cut called Boston butt, which is not what you think. It's a roastlike shoulder cut. For the real deal, the meat is slowwwwwwly smoked or grilled indirectly for 8 hours or so. The \"pulled\" part of the name comes from the fact that the cooked pork pulls apart with a fork. Many locals like their barbecue pork with a spicy vinegar sauce and a dollop of coleslaw plopped on top. Florida Cubanos Sandwich. Flattened like a panini, the Cuban-style sandwich is a simple combination of sliced ham, pork roast and, sometimes, salami. The cuts are layered on Cuban bread, a very ordinary white loaf. French or Italian also work. Swiss cheese is added and maybe a pickle. The sandwich is pressed as it is grilled, often using a panini-style griddle. In a pinch, some cooks bake the sandwich between aluminum-foil-wrapped fireplace bricks which have been heated in an oven. Meat juices, cheese and other ingredients mingle in the hot, squashed bun. The taste? Magnifico! Philly Cheesesteak. Fresh out of Philadelphia, the city's signature beef-and-melted-cheese sandwich really rings the flavor bell. The base is browned beef smothered in cheese. Short order cooks fry ingredients into a heaping mound on a hot griddle. Once done, the meaty concoction slides into a Hoagie roll and is topped with saut\u00e9ed onions, mushrooms, peppers or whatever you want. Guys on the street insist that Cheese Whiz is the best companion to the beef, while more sophisticated cooks insist o n using sliced or grated cheese. Either way is OK. California Vegetarian Sandwich. When the great tastes of the Golden State are listed, they should include avocado, oranges, lemons, bell peppers and sprouts. Put any of these between generous slices of fresh, nutty whole wheat bread and you have the start of a delightful, healthful vegetarian sandwich. Add whatever else your heart desires\u2014sweet peppers, olives, onions, toma- toes, lettuce and a healthy splash of strawberry vinaigrette dressing. California, here we come. Maine Lobster Rolls. If lobster sounds like awfully deep water for your cooking skills, don't worry. This is easy to pre- pare. It's similar to chicken salad, except the meat is from the ocean rather than a farm. All you do is boil a lobster tail for a few minutes, chunk the meat and whip everything together with mayonnaise, scallions, celery and other light tastes. Nothing to it. We gave our version a slight tartness by serving it on a sourdough roll. You may also use a French or Italian country loaf. If you prefer a Connecticut lobster roll, lay some warm lobster into a hot dog bun and drizzle it liberally with drawn butter. Whatever variation you try, it's all incredibly delicious. 26 seasons summer 2011 24-33 Sandwich LO7.indd 26 5/11/11 2:50 PMMAINE LOBSTER ROLLS You and your guests will hear the surf as you dig into this ocean treasure.

Fill the void with lobster mixture. If desired, sprinkle on dry dill and serve with lemon wedges .

Or heat a large nonstick skillet and large heavy soup pot over medium heat. Brush one side of each slice of bread with melted butter and place buttered-side-down on a cutting board. Layer pork, salami, ham, pickles, peppers and cheese on four bread slices. Place remaining bread slices buttered-side-up on sandwiches and press down with a spatula to flatten evenly. Place sandwiches, one at a time, in preheated grill. Grill until the bread is toasted and cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. If grill is not available, place sandwiches, one or two at a time, in the preheated skillet and weigh down with the preheated soup pot to flatten. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove pot and flip sandwiches over. Continue to cook with pot on sandwiches until second side is golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve with mustard, if desired. Test Kitchen note: Allow the meat and cheese to come to room temperature before grilling so the cheese melts evenly when the bread turns crisp and golden brown.

Plan a picnic with family, friends or that special someone and rediscover the joys of outdoor dining. TEXT JENNIFER RUISCH PHOTOGRAPHY TOBIN BENNETTStar-Spangled Picnic 34 seasons summer 2011 34-39 Picnic LO4.indd 34 5/12/11 11:23 AMThere's something about sharing food outdoors. Everything just seems to taste better. With the aroma of sweet wildflowers floating on the wind and a babbling brook as nature's background music, a picnic brings us back in tune with the rhythms of the earth. We are reminded of the bounty it provides. After time spent \"eating out\" with friends and family we often come away renewed and revived. Because of this, picnics may be counted among the most memorable meals of our lives. A WORLD OF CHOICES A picnic is a great catalyst for family bonding. Plan yours with a theme focused on the setting you've chosen. If you'll be eating by a tree-lined meadow, plan a \"Back to Nature\" event. Pack binoculars to watch birds and animals. Bring a book about plants, wildflowers or insects, and don't forget a ball and gloves for a rousing game of catch. If you'll be eating by the ocean, make it a beach-themed out- ing. Bring plastic buckets and other equipment needed for a sandcastle-building contest. Pack a Frisbee, kite or squirt guns for after-meal games and fun. If it's a pond, lake or other body of water, pack a couple fishing poles to cast away an hour or two on a lazy afternoon. Some of the most unforgetable picnics are ones that take place before or after events such as an outdoor concert, summer theater production in the park or baseball game. Let kids help determine the menu. Plan something quick and effortless, such as \"Build Your Own Pita Sandwiches.\" Pack a variety of meats, cheeses and toppings that can be stuffed inside pita pockets for easy assembly by little hands. This makes for easy cleanup by grown-ups so everyone can enjoy . A NEIGHBORLY GATHERING Making new friends is easy when you invite others to share a meal outdoors. Plan a picnic at a nearby park or common area and ask neighbors to join you. Everyone can share a bite and, as the kids enjoy a game of tag or softball, the adults can get to know each other a little better. Ask each family to bring a dish to share, while you'll provide the necessary paper products and drinks. Plan an icebreaker or two so everyone can learn about each other. These picnics are a fun and easy way to build a friendlier and safer community. A BLANKET FOR TWO For a date your partner will remember, plan a roman- tic picnic for two. First, choose a spot with an incredible view. An overlook near a body of water is always a good choice. Bring your iPod and portable speakers along so you can play romantic music in the background. Pack a favorite book to take turns read-ing aloud to each other after the meal. For an evening picnic, pick a spot with a good view of the sunset or a place away from city lights for stargazing after the sun goes down. Pack battery-operated candles to set the mood, and don't forget to bring a warm blanket in case there's a chill in the air. Choose a favorite country as inspiration for your theme. For a \"Taste of Italy\" picnic, pack a bottle of Italian wine or a non-alcoholic sparkling wine; a tomato, basil and mozzarella salad; focaccia bread and a bottle of olive oil. For a \"Taste of China,\" simply order from Hy-Vee Chinese Express and grab some chopsticks to go. Or try out some foods and drinks from other countries, such as France or Mexico. Eat slowly and enjoy the company, whether it's friends, family or a special someone. seasons hy-vee.com 35 34-39 Picnic LO4.indd 35 5/11/11 2:58 PMWhether you're eating at a picnic table or enjoying your meal on a cloth on the ground, a blanket is always a welcome addition. You can buy blanket totes, which are made especially for picnics. These blankets fold up into small packages and can be carried by a handle\u2014just like a tote bag. Bring a little bottle of talcum powder to sprinkle around your blanket once you get to the site. This will keep ants and other insects from marching off with your food. You'll need something to transport your picnic bounty. Consider investing in a basket that already contains all the amenities you'll need for your meal. These baskets are a little more expensive, but they'll save you time and hassle. You'll be thrilled when you don't have to go in search of every individual fork, napkin and cup you'll need because it's already packed and waiting for you. Family picnic baskets usually contain four cups, plates, utensils, napkins and a tablecloth or blanket. A picnic basket for two will often have everything needed for a romantic meal\u2014including a cutting board and knife for cheeses, a w aiter-style corkscr ew and two wine glasses. You can find bask ets that include everything from coffee cups to coolers to salt-and-pepper shakers. Or put together your own picnic kit with plastic pla tes, cups, napkin s, utensils and glasses from your loc al Hy-Vee. When deciding on foods to pack, finger foods are a great choice. Avoid anything too messy or greasy. Sticky sweets attract bugs, while c ookies are easier to handle. R emember there are a few foods that don't need any refrigeration at all and are usually a safe bet. These include chips, crackers, dried fruit, nuts, apples, oranges, bananas and unopened cans of meat or fruit. Don't forget condiments you might need\u2014mustard, mayo, ketchup, pickles, etc. The next time you're at a fast food restaurant, save your extra condiment packets to throw in your picnic basket when you get home. They don't need to be refrigerated. Finally, a few other items to pack include sunscreen, insect repellent, water bottles and antibacterial hand gel or moist towelettes. It's also nice to bring along a bag for trash and a camera to document the whole experience.

Chuck Seaman, assistant Vice Pres ident of Food Safety for Hy-Vee, says, \"Raw protein-based foods such as meats, poultry, fish, dairy and eggs should be kept cold until ready to be consumed.\" If you're taking cold foods on your picnic, Chuck suggests trans-porting them in a cooler packed with ice or frozen gel packs to help maintain appropriate temperature. Since the trunk of a car can reach temperatures of 150\u00b0F, it's often best to transport your cooler in the passenger area. When you arrive at the picnic site, put a blanket over the cooler and place it in the shade right away. Keep food covered until you're ready to use it\u2014this will minimize possible contamination from insects, which can carry harmful bacteria and viruses on their bodies. If you'd r ather not hassle with coolers and ice packs, there are plenty other food options to consider. \"Packaged foods and dry foods that don't require refrigeration, such as chips, cereals and breads, keep well,\" Chuck says. \"Similarly, canned goods usually don't raise food safety concern.\" He adds that all foods can have quality and taste affected by extreme temperatures, so err on the side of caution. Don't keep picnic leftovers. \"If there's a question about whether food has been kept at a pr oper temperatur e or if it's been exposed to contamination, discard it,\" Chuck says. \"The cost of food is not worth getting sick over.\" FOOD SAFETYMini Sweet Watermelon $3.49 KELLOGG 'SKellogg's Cereals: select varieties 16.7 to 25.5 oz. $2.99Kellogg's Pop-Tarts: select varieties 12 ct. 2/$5.00 Start the day right with one of our breakfast foods, then grab some granola or cereal bars or Keebler cookies to take along on your picnic.

TEXT STACI SCHEURENBRAND PHOTOGRAPHY KING AU AND TOBIN BENNETT 40 seasons summer 2011 40-47 Ice Cream LO12.indd 40 5/11/11 3:03 PMWhen the hottest part of summer is upon us, so is the craving for a yummy frozen treat. It's easy to imagine scoops of ice cream piled high on a cone or filling frosty dessert bowls. But is this favorite summer- time treat the threat to our waistlines and well-being that it is purported to be? Maybe not, says Chrissy Mitzel, registered dietitian at Hy-Vee in Rock Island, Illinois. You need to get the full scoop on ice cream so you can appreciate some of its unexpected benefits. If you choose wisely, it can be better for your body than you think, while helping you chill on hot days. \"Everyone is excited to hear that there are important health aspects to ice cream,\" Chrissy says. \"With one half-cup serving providing 8 to 15 percent of the daily calcium needed, ice cream adds a pleasing nutritional boost to your diet, especially if you make your own treats.\" Ice cream's unhealthy reputation derives from the high fat and sugar content found in many products. But since dairy is part of a healthy diet\u2014providing essential vitamins and minerals, includ-ing potassium, riboflavin and vitamins A and C\u2014ice cream can be a nutritious food. By legal definition, ice cream contains at least 10 percent milk- fat and 16 percent or more milkfat for premium brands. With slightly less fat than American ice creams, gelato, an Italian-style ice cream, contains just 6-10 percent milkfat, and has bold flavors and a velvety texture. SKINNY DIPPING Before you turn a cold shoulder to products that are labeled \"low fat,\" \"fat free\" and \"sugar free,\" sample them. Manufacturers have gotten much better at concocting products that taste great while being healthful at the same time. \"Low-fat or fat-free frozen yogurt is an excellent choice,\" Chrissy says. \"Many varieties of frozen yogurt contain active cultures, so in addition to calcium, you get the benefits of probiotics. Such brands as Skinny Cow, Smart Ones and many others even contain fiber. Since most Americans do not meet their recommended fiber intake each day now, any increase in nutritional value is positive.\" If you're averse to dairy or you're simply craving a frozen treat with a little more zing, fruity sher- bets and sorbets are a refreshingly tart alternative to ice cream. While both are generally all about the fruit, sorbets are technical- ly ices that contain no dairy. Sherbets contain milk or some fat, which make them smooth and creamy\u2014just like ice cream. Chrissy says, \"It's important to remember that not all products labeled 'fat free' and 'non-dairy' are low in calories. Read labels and compare NuVal scores to find the most nutritious options. Customers can't believe it when I show them a few ice cream products with a near-perfect NuVal score of 99-100!\" HOMEMADE GOODNESS All ice creams add bone-building vitamin D to your diet. With the homemade variety, you can also pick ingredients and toppings that are good for your body. Building on a base of cream, milk, vanilla and sugar, you can increase the nutritional value and liven up the flavor of the ice cream you make. \"Experiment with flavors that produce a healthy result. The trick is keeping it simple,\" Chrissy says. \"Such mix-ins as fresh fruit, nuts and dark chocolate add extra vitamins, fiber and antioxidants, rather than wasted calories and less healthy fats. And the taste is superior!\" Before you scream for ice cream, keep in mind that those colossal, candy-studded cones and sundaes from your favorite ice cream shop can pack a day's worth of fat and calo-ries. It's okay to splurge on occasion, but for a quick fix that offers nutritional benefits, check for healthful options in the ice cream aisle or make a batch of homemade. seasons hy-vee.com 41 40-47 Ice Cream LO12.indd 41 5/11/11 3:04 PMICE CREAM STIR-INS Make one batch of vanilla ice cream and add the following ingredients to create each flavor.

Most of us have some distant, glorified memory of taking turns on the crank and fighting over the first lick of melty ice cream. Although old-fashioned hand-crank ice cream makers are still being used today, most have been replaced with newer, sleeker models with motorized compressors. The investment choice comes down to time and money. Manual: Uses rock salt, ice and good ol' elbow grease. Separate bowls are used for food ingredients and the rock salt/ice com-bination. Rock salt brings the temperature of the ice down to 27 \u00b0F, so the texture is creamy. A hand crank is used to turn mixing blades in a continual rotation, preventing ice crystals from forming while also aerating the ice cream. Prices range from $75-$200. Electric: There are two types of electric ice cream freezers and both deliver great results. The first, and most popular of all ice cream makers, is just like the manual version except an electric motor mixes the in-gredients. The newest and simplest models are compressor freezers. With a compressor freez-er, you don't use rock salt, ice, separate bowls or inserts. Simply place the ingredients in the ice cream maker and turn it on. Prices range from $30-$1,000 for electric freezers. SPAGHETTI ICE CREAM Created by an Italian in Germany, spaghetti ice cream has been a European specialty since the 1960s.

This classic is still a favorite, though creative new versions have come along to update summer's most memorable taste. Would it be too daring to try a s'more with pineapple, maraschino cherries or white chocolate? Oh, go ahead. TEXT JENN HINDMAN AND JILL JOHNSON PHOTOGRAPHY KING AU Gotta Have 48 seasons summer 2011 48-51 Smores LO4.indd 48 5/11/11 3:08 PMS'mores call out the kid in us. They transport us to campfires on starry summer nights where we run around with marshmallow goo on our chins, giddy with excitement. Experience has taught us how to eat a s'more. Starting at a corner, we make the first bite big enough to breach the delicate, fire-singed crust of the marshmallow, releasing molten billows of sweetness. The firelight now reveals slightly melted chocolate mingling with pure white marshmallow, inciting another bite. Crispy graham crackers keep most of the wonderful muddle off our hands, but thankfully, finger-licking is condoned here. Foolish adults may have learned to stop at one or two, but that's their loss. Drawn by the thrill of toasting marshmallows, kids eat as many of the sweet sandwiches as their tummies allow. They continually return for\u2014you guessed it\u2014\"s'more.\" THE CLASSIC: STICKING AROUND FOR GOOD The origins of this iconic treat are up for debate, but the first printed recipe of the s'more appeared in a 1927 Girl Scouts cook-book. More than 80 years later, its fame is commemorated annually on August 10, National S'mores Day. Perhaps its timeless popular-ity is due in part to its simplicity: a piece of chocolate and a toasted marshmallow sandwiched between two graham cracker squares. Strong associations with carefree experiences of youth also keep s'mores high on the favorite list. Any kid who's ever scorched a skewered marshmallow knows the satisfaction of having \"cooked\" something for the first time. But classic s'mores wouldn't be the hit they are today if they weren't downright delicious. Though s'mores taste best amid campfire smoke and the sound of chirping crickets, they are just too good to limit to an occasional outdoor gathering. Enthusiasts now fix them using a variety of heat sources, including outdoor grills and indoor fireplaces. To make perfectly gooey s'mores in the microwave or oven broiler, stack chocolate and a marshmallow on one graham cracker square; set aside the top cracker. Place in the microwave for 8-10 seconds or on a baking pan under the broiler for a few minutes, watching closely. When the marshmallow is hot and puffed up, remove the half-s'more and squash it down with the top cracker. THE CREATIVE: NOT YOUR GRANDPA'S S'MORE With no less respect for the traditional version, another camp of s'more devotees reason that such a remarkable combination is a worthy springboard for creating further generations of delecta-ble treats. Thinking outside the box of graham crackers results in s'mores made with cookies, fruit, nuts, peanut butter and choco-late candies. Be inspired by the variations shown on pages 50-51 to create your own signature snacks. What's in your cupboard that might make an incredible s'more?

Sweet and bursting with flavor, they're chock full of nutrients and health benefits. TEXT COURTENAY WOLF PHOTOGRAPHY JESSE RAMIREZ AND TOBIN BENNETT One of summer's most irresistible fruits, cherries are a sweet treat loaded with good things for your body. They're a great source of Vitamin C and high in iron, potassium and anti-oxidants. They may even offer anti-inflammatory benefits. Eaten fresh, they provide an easy, healthy snack in a delicious package that's low in calories and contains no fat or sodium. You'll find fresh-from-the-orchard cherries in your local Hy-Vee from May to late August. FAMILY GROWERS Hy-Vee produce managers and Stemilt Growers work to bring you the freshest cherries at their flavor peak. \"Stemilt is a family-owned company,\" says Joe Stoltz, a Hy-Vee produce manager in Davenport, Iowa. Joe recently returned from a trip to Stemilt's West Coast orchards and what he saw impressed him. \"People who work for the company have a true passion for what they do, and they care about quality as much as we do.\" Quality starts with orchards developing in the optimal growing conditions. Sweet cherries require a rare microclimate, found in the U.S. primarily in the Pacific Northwest and California. \"Cherries need dry conditions during bloom and harvest, and mild temperatures while the fruit is developing,\" explains Jake Harding, a Hy-Vee produce manager from Omaha who was also on the Stemilt trip. \"The coastal mountain ranges block the rain.\" Abundant sun, perfect soils and water only when needed complete the picture. Once ripened, sweet cherries must be shipped immediately to preserve freshness. \"They're actually on a refrigerated truck to us within 36 hours of being picked,\" says Joe. \"That's why you won't find them in the stores year-round.\" At Stemilt, cherry season begins in late winter when the trees are pruned, opening them up to sun and air so the fruit will ripen more easily. Starting in February in California, nature puts on a glorious show of color. \"It was an incredible scene ... cherry trees in bloom as far as I could see, miles and miles of them,\" says Joe. \"There were bees everywhere and the scent of flowers was just indescribable.\" seasons hy-vee.com 53 52-59 Cherries LO5.indd 53 5/11/11 3:13 PMOn an early spring trip to Stemilt Growers cherry orchards in California, Hy-Vee produce managers Joe Stolz and Jake Harding, above left, were impressed by the family-owned operation. Joe, left, is from the store in Davenport, Iowa, and Jake, right, is from the Omaha store. Though it was a rainy day, nothing dampened their enthusia sm as they witnessed a pass ion for quality and attention to detail by all at Stemilt. Every cherry was h and-picked. Pickers moved up 12-foot ladders, carefully twisting off each cherry to make sure the stems remain on the fruit. The cooling process began in the orchards, helping to ensure freshness. When the harvest is in full swing as it warms, only top grade cherries will be sent to Hy-Vee stores. TREE TO TABLE In May the California orchards buzz with activity as the harvest season begins. The race is on to handpick every ripe cherry at its peak and get it to market. From California, the harvest moves up to south central Washington and from there north to the Canadian border. Varied latitudes and elevations stretch Stemilt's cherry sea-son from May into late August. \"During harvest, crews are fast, but careful,\" says Jake. \"They don't just pull a handful. They pick one at a time, leaving the stems on to prolong the life of the cherry.\" Inside the orchards, mobile cooling stations bring the temperature down quickly to preserve the just-picked flavor. Gradually hydrocooling the fruit into the low 30s preserves its just-from-the-tree freshness. Without the chill, cherries would release the ethylene gas that promotes aging. \"The cold chain is never broken, from the time the cherries leave the tree, as they're sorted and packaged, to the time they're delivered to us and we put them on display,\" says Jake. \"That's why we like working with Stemilt. They pay attention to all the details. That individual relationship allows us to ensure we're getting the freshest cherries possible.\" \"Sweet cherries are ripe and ready to eat when you buy them,\" says Joe. \"If you want to store them, get them home quickly and into the coldest part of your refrigerator.\" You can wash them first if you like. Just be sure to leave the stems on and dry them well before storing. They'll store for 3-5 days, if you can resist tasting them for that long! In mid-August, Ranier cherries arrive. Less familiar to most consumers, these yellow cherries with their bright pink blush have a sweeter, crisper flavor than the red variety. \"They're a premium fruit,\" says Joe, \"a little higher in price because they're more diffi-cult to grow.\" Washington cherry lovers are so fond of Raniers that stores take orders for them. GOOD FOR YOU TOO One of nature's superfoods, cherries are bursting with health benefits. They're among the top 20 foods with the highest concen-tration of antioxidants. One cup can carry 4,873 different types. Researchers believe antioxidants help slow the production of free radicals, which are associated with aging, cancer and heart disease. Cherries are especially rich in the antioxidant anthocyanin, also found in grapes and red wine. It is anthocyanins that give the fruit its deep burgundy color and protect cells from damage. Research-ers are finding that they protect the brain and the heart, slowing down the formation of plaque and reducing inflammation. This fruit is a sweet treat that's low in fat, high in health benefits and bursting with flavor. You can't go wrong with cherries. 54 seasons summer 2011 52-59 Cherries LO5.indd 54 5/11/11 3:13 PMCHERRY APPLE PIE Cherries carry the weight of the taste, while the apples add a subtle, slightly less-sweet background fl avor.

So clean and properly store the produce when you get home. Wash cherries under cool tap water before eating or using in recipes. Fresh cherries may be kept for eating uncovered in the coldest part of the refrigerator for 3-5 days, taking them out about an hour before serving for the best fl avor. Cherries will absorb odors, so keep other stro ng-smelling foods covered. PITTINGTo easily remove a cherry pit when eating the fresh fruit, slice open each fruit with a knife and pop out the pit. If you prefer to keep the cherries whole, a variety of simple-to-use pitting devices are available at most kitchen supply stores, or try one of these home methods: Using a paper clip or bobby pin: Start with a new or thoroughly cleaned clip/pin. Insert the loop into the center of the cherry, gently press around the pit and lift up. Using a knife blade: Gently press fruit until it cracks. Continue to gently squeeze the fruit between your thumb and a nger, and extract the pit with a knife. This technique crushes the fruit, but it works well if you are making pies, sauces or jams. FREEZING To freeze whole cherries, place a single layer of washed and dried cherries\u2014do not remove stems\u2014on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Dry-ness is key, so pat away any excess water before freezing. Place frozen cherries in an airtight plastic container or freezer bag, and store in the freezer for up to 12 months. Thaw frozen cherries in the refrigerator rath-er than heating them to room temperature\u2014to maintain the fruit's juice and rmness. For a special frosty treat, serve cherries slightly frozen. CANNING CHERRIESWhether sweet or sour, all cherries may be canned for later use. Here are the basics steps for canning this delectable fruit. Select freshly harvested cherries with deep uniform color and ideal maturity for eating. Allow 2 to 3 pounds per quart. Stem and wash. If desired, pit and treat cherries with ascorbic acid color keeper solution, using a ratio of 1 teaspoon ascorbic acid powder (Fruit-Fresh brand is one sold at Hy-Vee) per cup of water; drain. If preserved unpitted, prick skins on opposite sides with a clean needle to prevent splitting. Place raw cherries in jars. Cover with a light syrup, made by boiling a mixture of 1\u00bd cups sugar and 4 cups water. (Allow \u00bd to 2/3 cup syrup for 2 cups fruit.) Leave a \u00bd-inch headspace in jar. Process pints and quarts for 25 minutes, according to canning equipment instructions. Once processed, remove jars from canner with a jar lifter and place on a towel or rack. Do not retighten screw bands. Air-cool jars for 12-24 hours. Remove screw bands and check lid seals. If the center of the lid is indented, wash, dry, label and store jar in a clean, cool, dark place. Cherries are best if consumed within one year. BRANDIED CHERRIES Brandy-soaked cherries are an irresistible topper for ice cream, pies and slices of grilled pound cake. They're very easy to make. Combine 1 quart of brandy and 2 cups sugar until sugar is dissolved. Add 2 pounds of stemmed and pitted cherries. Store in tightly covered jars in the refrigerator for 6 weeks before using. Cherries will keep, refrigerated, for up to one year. seasons hy-vee.com 57 52-59 Cherries LO5.indd 57 5/11/11 3:14 PMPORK CHOP WITH FRESH CHERRY SAUCE Heighten pork's natural sweetness with a cherry sauce.

The Stemilt Hill microclim ate, stretching for miles, offered perfect growing conditions for fruit trees. A family passion was born and five generations later this family-owned business is still going strong. The road was not easy. In 1947 after ret urning from World War II, Tom Mathison took over managing the farm following the unexpected death of his father. Tom had some lean years. Like other growers, he found it frustrating th at the premium cherrie s he was delivering to wholesalers had lost their luster by the time they reached grocery stores. Undaunted, he set out to remedy that. Tom began pioneering new systems to improve the quality of fruit in the marketplace, building a packing house and developing direct relation-ships with grocers. Gradually he expanded Stemilt's growing areas to provide sweet cherries and other fruits over a longer season. Years before it became popular, Tom began talking about sustainability and going green. In 1989 he launched the Responsible Choice program, transitioning many acres to organic practices and beginning a compost-ing operation th at has grown to 23 acres. Today the compan y is known for its earth-friendly practices. For the past thr ee years Stemilt has been recognized as one of the greenest companies in Washington state. As time passed, Tom's children and grandchildren joined the company, catching his passion for growing and delivering fresh wholesome fruit at the peak of ripeness. Today they lead the company Tom built. Stemilt works directly with Hy-Vee produce buyers, delivering sweet cherries to stores from May to late August. The average Stemilt cherry is eaten fresh within five to seven days of leaving the orchard.STEMILT-A FAMILY LEGACY Top: On a mild day, four generations of the Mathison family gather near their cherry orchards on Stemilt Hill, which overlooks Wenatchee, Wash-ington.

Good friends, good food and a good glass of wine\u2014and an hour or two after work to enjoy all three. A sunset get-together helps you and your friends decompress and take it easy after a tough day. Easy bite-size appetizers and drinks will make your party a success. TEXT WANDA VENTLING PHOTOGRAPHY TOBIN BENNETT Why wait for the weekend to entertain when a small-plate party can be pulled together in a flash? Gather a few good friends around your kitchen bar or table to decompress after a busy workday. Tasty bite-size foods are the best fare especially when they are fresh, flavorful, fast and fun. Ease everyone into relaxation mode by offering one appetizer you make in five minutes or less and a refresh- ing drink. After that, serve a freshly prepared appetizer every 20 or 30 minutes and be sure to have nonalcoholic drinks available for those who prefer. Small-plate servings and limited alcohol means your predinner gathering will perfectly whet the appetite for the meal they'll be enjoying later at home. FUN FOR ALL Preparing food for friends is a sign of hospitality and it's free entertainment for guests. Cooking shows have become a national television pastime for good reason. Bring the fun to your kitchen with simple, quick-cook recipes. Invite guests to hang out in the kitchen, helping with final details. Let them play chef, if that's their desire. Other guests may prefer chilling out with a first appetizer and a drink. That's OK, too. This is a party, not a test. FRESH, FLAVORFUL & FAST For a quick appetizer nothing beats a platter full of crunchy vegetables paired with creamy dip for fresh taste that is easy on the waistline. Crudit\u00e9s go from refrigerator to table in minutes and get the party started while you prep foods or wait for hot appetizers to bake. You can prepare most veggies the night before your party, storing them in zip-close bags or a water-filled covered container. Make one or more dips following the recipes on page 66. Some of these can be made the day ahead, too. Pair dips with veggies, crudit\u00e9s or tortilla chips. Olives from the self-service bar in the Hy-Vee produce department are a savory offering ready in seconds when poured into a serving container. Spend a few minutes more and plate a selection of olives and thinly sliced smoked meats and pickled vegetables for a flavorful antipasto platter. Delallo bulk olives, mushrooms or antipastas select varieties per lb. $7.99 seasons 3:17 PMTyson Family Pack Breaded Chicken: select varieties 20 to 32 oz. $7.491. Think small. Set out bite-size baked goods and easy- to-prepare appetizers, such as fruit, that guests can nosh whether they are standing or sitting. 2. Cheese and crackers offer taste adventures. Swiss or Muenster chunks are a good match for hearty wheat crackers. Other good pairings are Wisconsin cheddar\u2014try newer varieties, such as those mixed with fruit\u2014and buttery crackers, or garlic-and-herb goat cheese and water crackers. A wheel of Brie is always welcome at a party. Soften a wheel in a low-heat oven for a few minutes, and top it with a layer of apricot preserves. Serve with crackers or thinly sliced French bread toasts. 3. While vegetables are an answer for any finger-food party, they don't have to be time-consuming or boring to prepare. Make your choices based on color as well as taste. Celery, broccoli and cucumbers look lively when paired with tomatoes and carrots. And make unexpected choices, such as including smoked chile peppers. Remov-ing membranes inside the peppers lets you control the heat, so guests can have a comfortable evening. 4. Pick up a few small bread loaves, spread on dip or cream cheese and top with fresh herbs, meat or vegeta-bles. Good choices include cucumber and cream cheese, smoked Scottish salmon, tenderloin steak with stone-ground mustard, grilled chicken with peach-glazed Brie and herbed cream cheese with veggies. 5. Everyone is social around a fondue pot. Small chunks of steak, chicken, pork or vegetables are great after a sizzle in hot oil. Tasty dippers for a melted pot of cheese are bite-size pieces of Sourdough Bread from the Hy-Vee Baking Stone Bread line. Because the fondue pot will be hot, set it up in a safe spot. This can be the center of a dining table, if it is within easy reach of all who gather for a treat. Or place it on a cleared counter, letting people walk up to dip. 6. Guests will feel pampered when they spy red, ripe strawberries dipped in white chocolate. Although these look elegant, washing and dipping the strawberries in melted chocolate is simple and quick. Since they need time to chill, strawberries are a great make-ahead item.

Just a few changes can make all the difference. TEXT KRISTI THOMAS, R.D. PHOTOGRAPHY TOBIN BENNETT 68 seasons summer 2011 68-71 Healthy Meal LO3.indd 68 5/11/11 3:20 PMTacos don't have to be a nutrition offender. Unfortunately, restaurant taco shells are of-ten fried in grease and slathered with sour cream, making them high in fat and calories. Make tacos at home and you can limit ingredients to nutritious choices. Plus, you can easily serve up a tasty meal. For comparison, we matched our taco against a soft-shell super taco from a fast-food chain. The restaurant taco has fresh ingredients, including seasoned beef, re-fried beans, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and sour cream. All that adds up to 590 calories, 10 grams of satu-rated fat, 65 milligrams of cholesterol, 2,410 milligrams of sodium and 30 grams of protein. The taste is great, though some numbers are still quite high. We can do better. THE MEAT & SHELL Fast-food tacos come with ground meat or poultry ranging from 30 percent fat to 5 percent fat, depending on the cut used. At home you're wiser to choose 90- to 95-percent lean meat. Don't be afraid to use beef. One ounce of 93-percent lean ground turkey and 95-percent lean ground beef have comparable nutritional profiles, according to the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference. Here are the numbers*: *Source: USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference Whether fast-food tacos are made with flour tortillas or hard corn shells, you'll be paying a price. They can be high in calories, sodium and fat. For an alternative, take a tip from Asian cuisine and wrap your next taco in lettuce. A lettuce leaf has just 1 or 2 calories, no fat and no salt. Search out new lettuce varieties, such as butterhead, which has a lighter crunch and more vibrant color than iceberg. If you still crave a little snap when you bite into your meal, smash a few tortilla chips and add them to the meat and other fixings when you put the taco together. Whether you choose poultry or beef, the sky is the limit with flavor and ingredients. Oregano (Mexican-style, if you have it), cayenne pepper, cumin (a staple in Mexican cuisine), garlic and chili powder deliver super flavor. Fast food often comes loaded with salt. Who needs it? Toss in chopped green pepper, fresh tomato and a light sprinkling of cheese for a nutrition-packed meal. For salsa try something new, such as a mango or pineapple variety. Many are low in salt and high on flavor. Try making a batch of your own salsa. Also, choose reduced-fat cheese. Use a small scoop of light sour cream to save 9 calories and 1 gram of fat per tablespoon. Keep on eating smart with homemade Mexican Slaw and alcohol-free Fiesta Freezes, page 71. Fresh, natural ingredients from the produce section of Hy-Vee will keep you happy and healthy. STRONG NUVAL SCORE Many food ingredients at Hy-Vee are rated according to the NuVal Nutritional Scoring System. Food is given a score based on a scale of 1 to 100. The higher the score, the more healthful the food. For example, our Turkey Taco Lettuce Wrap has a NuVal score of about 70. Though turkey and some seasonings have not yet been rated by NuVal, low-fat turkey should achieve a superior score when compared to high-fat beef generally used in fast-food restaurants. If you have questions about the NuVal system, your local Hy-Vee registered dietitian has the answers.
