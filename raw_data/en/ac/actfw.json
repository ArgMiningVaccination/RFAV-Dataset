Report to the Texas Pharmacy Congress \u2014 Feb. 26, 2021 UH College of Pharmacy Pharm.D. students, faculty members and alumni are eagerly responding to the call for immunizers as COVID-19 vaccination efforts get underway across Texas. In the first effort, UHCOP team members assisted with the vaccination clinics organized by the college's Rio Grande Valley Pharm.D. Satellite Program partner, Edinburg-based DHRHealth. Most recently, UHCOP immunizers assisted in with the Memorial Hermann Health System's drive-through clinic at Houston's NRG Park, which saw over 14,000 immunized over four days. Volunteer students and faculty delivered immunizations, manned pre-immunization screening and post-immunization observation stations, and transported doses between staging and immunization areas.Students, Faculty and Alumni Join COVID-19 Vaccination Clinics in Houston, Rio Grande Valley Zhang Tapped to Lead New Drug Discovery Institute at UH Ruiwen Zhang, M.D., Ph.D., DABT, UHCOP Robert L. Boblitt Endowed Professor of Drug Discovery, has been appointed as the inaugural director of the new multidisciplinary UH Drug Discovery Institute. The institute - UH's eighth University-wide research center - is a partnership between the UH colleges of Pharmacy, Natural Sciences and Mathematics and Cullen College of Engineering, in equal measure, with faculty affiliations from several other colleges. The ultimate goal of the DDI research program is to bring scientific discoveries and technological advances to the marketplace. UH has expertise across many aspects of the drug discovery process, such as high-throughput screening technologies, organ-on-chip models, biosensing and biofeedback, and molecular modeling. The UHCOP Chapter of the Student National Pharmaceutical Association (SNPhA) brought home national awards for its local outreach efforts as well as winner or finalist rankings in team-based competitions at the 2020 SNPhA Virtual National Convention Nov. 4-6. Among the national health education campaigns completed during the 2019-20 academic year, the UHCOP chapter secured awards for the Fighting Diabetes, The Power to End Stroke/Smoking Cessation, Mental Health, and Project Keepsake initiatives. Chapter members Will Chollett and Lauren Lee won the P2 division of the SNPhA Kroger Clinical Skills Competition, and Ndidi Chiedu and Faith Awoniyi were members of the first runner-up team in the 2nd Annual SNPhA L.E.A.P. at Lilly Business Plan Competition. Student Emily (Emy) Cooper, who served as 2019-20 National Recording Secretary, received a national Kroger/ National Pharmaceutical Association (NPhA) Foundation scholarship and was among the finalists for the National J.B. Hills Chapter President of the Year Award. The chapter also was among the Top 3 Chapters in overall scoring for the Chauncey I. Cooper Chapter of the Year Award. SNPhA Chapter, Members Earn Outreach and Skills Competition Awards at Nationals SNPhA members discuss stress and mental health with children at a health fair. Faculty & Research News Garey Named Fellow of Infectious Diseases Society of America Kevin W. Garey, Pharm.D., M.S., FASHP, professor and chair of the college's Department of Pharmacy Practice and Translational Research, was recently honored as a 2020 Fellow of the prestigious Infectious Diseases Society of America. Garey is recognized internationally as an infectious diseases (ID) pharmacotherapy expert, especially in innovative diagnostics and novel therapeutic approaches to Clostridiodes difficile infection (CDI). An award-winning researcher and educator, Garey has published more than 200 research papers in peer- reviewed journals and several book chapters. Garey also co-founded a two-year ID fellowship program in collaboration with CHI St. Luke's Health-Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center. He has led or collaborated on research grant projects and pre-clinical/ clinical trials funded by such entities as the CDC and the National Institutes of Health as well as both small and large organizations in the pharmaceutical industry, such as Abbott, AstraZeneca and Merck. Within the IDSA, Garey has served as a member and author of its Clinical Practice Guidelines for CDI and member of its Standards and Practice Guidelines Committee that have produced numerous practice guideline updates in collaboration with the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) and other professional health care organizations.UHCOP Professor Hua Chen, M.D., Ph.D., has been awarded a $455,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health to study the effectiveness of antidiabetic drug Metformin in preventing weight gain among pediatric patients upon initiation of antipsychotic medications for mental health pharmacotherapy. In up to 80% of cases, the use of atypical/second- generation antipsychotic drugs causes antipsychotic- induced weight gain (AIWG) with children gaining up to 120 pounds in a single year. \"Our prior work found that most of the AIWG in children and adolescents happened during the first three months of SGA treatment, and SGA discontinuation only reversed a quarter of the weight the patient gained during the treatment within one year of SGA cessation,\" Chen said. Not only can childhood onset obesity carry a greater risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases than adult onset, that much weight gain typically causes children and teens to stop taking their medicine. \"We have seen many cases where the discontinuation of the needed medicine leads to a patient becoming hospitalized due to a suicidal attempt or other mental health crisis,\" Chen said. Using a large national electronic medical record database, Chen will identify children and adolescents aged 6 to 19 years who were treated with Metformin during the first 24 months of SGA treatment. Chen will also identify patient subgroups following certain weight development trajectories, who are most likely to benefit from the use of Metformin, and from its early intervention.NIH Backs Study of Metformin to Prevent Weight Gain in Pediatric Mental Health Patients Student News In the Virtual TX SNPhACON 2020 Clinical Skills Competition in November, UHCOP Pharm.D. students Ricky Huynh-Phan and Duc Huynh won first place and Julie Nguyen and Wendy Nguyen won second place, respectively, in the P3 Division; Lauren Lee and Noemie Senawong won second place in the P2 Division; and Aniqa Virani and Sarah Thomas won first place in the P1 Division. UHCOP Pharm.D. students presented a state-high 30 research posters during the American Society of Health System Pharmacists 2020 Virtual Midyear Clinical Meeting and Expo Dec. 6-10. UH's Delta Delta Chapter of the Kappa Psi Pharmaceutical Fraternity has been awarded a $1,000 grant from the International Kappa Psi Philanthropy Committee to purchase, collect and assemble care packages for Houston's homeless community. The chapter's care packages will consist of health products, such as masks, soap and toothbrushes, as well as water bottles and clean socks, and will be distributed by Mission Centers of Houston's Gano Mission Center, a nonprofit arm of the Union Baptist Association of Texas. Two new student organizations within UHCOP have gained official recognition from UH Pharmacy Council and the University of Houston: the African Pharmacy Students Association and the Society for Sexual and Gender Disparities in Pharmacy. Kappa Psi's Delta Delta Wins 5th SW Province Chapter of Year Award UHCOP's Delta Delta Chapter of the Kappa Psi Pharmaceutical Fraternity has secured its fifth consecutive Chapter of the Year Award in the national organization's Southwest Province. Among the chapter's activities during the 2019-20 academic year were coordinating eight wellness fairs; collecting 80 books, creating dozens of bookmarks, and volunteering to read to children at local pediatric clinics; and raising money for Hurricane Dorian relief fund. In addition, Chapter Regent Julie Lu and Webmaster Rustin Pevehouse were elected to the Kappa Psi Southwest Province Executive Board as Historian and Webmaster, respectively.Faculty & Research News College Welcomes Sanket Patel, Natalie Rosario to Faculty UHCOP recently welcomed hypertension/ kidney researcher Sanket N.
