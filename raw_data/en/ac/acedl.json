The Skinny Average Recovery 1 days Permanence Temporary Application Mechanical Abrasion Surgical No Cost $75 - $300 The Specifics What is crystal microdermabrasion? Crystal microdermabrasion is a minimally invasive abrasive skin resurfacing procedure to revitalize and clear the complexion. A typical crystal microdermabrasion procedure lasts about 30 minutes and uses an aluminum oxide or sodium bicarbonate tipped wand. During the treatment, a concentrated stream of crystals is gently sanded across the skin surface to exfoliate the epidermal skin layer (top skin layer), while a suction device reabsorbs the used crystals and damaged/dead skin cells. This reveals healthier skin, and encourages the body to augment collagen production. What cosmetic concerns does a crystal microdermabrasion procedure treat? [Fine Lines & Wrinkles](https://aedit.com/concern/fine-lineswrinkles): Crystal tip microdermabrasion is a mechanical exfoliation of skin cell layers to remove old and damaged cells, and encourage new cell growth and collagen production.
