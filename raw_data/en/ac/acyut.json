Note: This is not to be used for insomnia. Effective radioprotective actions show that including melatonin as an adjuvant in radiation therapy may decrease the normal tissue damage induced by irradiation, which leads to more tumor control by use of higher doses of irradiation during radiotherapy. Furthermore, due to its antitumor and radiosensitizing properties, treatment with melatonin is likely to increase damage to the tumor.

This product allows me to get through the month with 1 -2 caps a day (depending on what I need). I am so grateful "}
