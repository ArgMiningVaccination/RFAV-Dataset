Michael Dym, VMD Royal Palm HOMEOPATHIC TREATMENT AND FEES Classical homeopathic treatment of chronic disease involves a thorough and comprehensive review of the animal's totality symptom status on a mental, emotional and physical level. While animal guardians typically contact the services of a classical homeopath often for a specific health problem i.e chronic skin/ear allergies, digestive tract issues, kidney issues, cancer, etc , a thorough homeopathic evaluation and treatment plan first involves a homeopathic/holistic intake, which typically takes anywhere between 60 and 90 minutes, during which time, an important time line of historical symptom tendencies over the life of the patient is obtained. Such information is critical for the classical homeopath to arrive at a thorough understanding of the patient's even current health status, as the earlier expressions of the patient's life force, during times of prior acute disease states, as well as other prior chronic health tendencies, are all part of the current assessment of the patient; all viewed as symptom expressions of the ONE chronic disease manifesting in different ways and in different organ systems over time. The individuality of these prior symptom expressions, as well as the individuality of the current disease state, provide the important clues to the classical homeopath in coming up with a carefully prescribed, SINGLE constitutional homeopathic remedy, which best addresses the overall totality symptom state, in hopefully curing the patient of not only current symptom imbalances, but in removing the tendencies and susceptibilities of prior disease states, which typically have been only palliated or suppressed by prior conventional medicine or eclectic holistic therapies done in the past. For most chronic diseases, followups are typically and initially done every 4 to 6 weeks for the first 4 to 6 months of treatment , where the symptom totality status is reviewed, and a decision is made on waiting longer on the first homeopathic prescription, redosing the patient with the same remedy, or moving on to another homeopathic remedy to address the next layer of the problem being expressed by the patient. The typical followups usually run anywhere between 15 and 30 minutes., but are critical to maintain sustained progress with this type of treatment, in hopefully curing the patient of these chronic disease states over time. While Dr Dym will often recommend supportive nutritional therapies and/or supplements to help support the patient's maximal healing potential, it is the sequential use of SINGLE prescribed, constitutional homeopathic remedies, carefully evaluated over time, which is the basis of the deeper, homeopathic cure of the patient. During homeopathic treatment it is very important to not use any conventional, allopathic treatment, either topically or internally, unless approved by Dr Dym, as such well intentioned interventions, may interfere with homeopathic progress in the case. It is also important NOT to use any other holistic therapies, including combination homeopathic formulas, chinese herbal therapies, acupuncture, or chiropractic, unless approved by Dr Dym, as certain holistic therapies also interfere with homeopathic progress. Dr Dym encourages clients to read through the booklet on the website [www.beyondflatearth.com](//www.beyondflatearth.com), which explains the chronic, constitutional homeopathic process, including the exteriorization of symptoms, discharges, etc that are so important to deeper healing of the patient. Dr Dym also encourages animal guardians to obtain copies of the book Dr Pitcairn's Guide To Natural Health for Dogs and Cats, by Richard Pitcairn, DVM, phd, and/or The Natural Cat, by Anitra Frazier, which Dr Dym often refers to for supportive measures needed during the long term, patient homeopathic process. Between consultations, clients are welcome to email Dr Dym with brief questions or symptom updates when asked, which are typically returned within 1 to 2 business days, as emails are checked a few times daily. However, if a pet's symptom status intensifies to a concerning level before Dr Dym is able to return an email or phone call, and there is an imminent and urgent concern for a pet's well being, than it is important to go to the nearest local veterinary emergency clinic for stabilization and care of the animal. Dr Dym's consultation time is billed out at $295.00 an hour, which includes any review of prior historical/lab data, background information for the initial consultation, as well as any homeopathic analysis/case study and remedy study/selection. Unless arranged ahead of time, a current credit card is maintained on file for billing of all homeopathic/holistic consultation services. In the event of a change in credit card number or card status held on file, the client must provide Dr Dym with updated and current credit card information before the next consultation. Email updates and/or quick questions are free of charge, unless a new homeopathic analysis and/or further study of the case is needed. Homeopathic remedies mailed to clients typically run between $15.00 and $25.00, whereas extra doses of remedy envelopes mailed to clients for holding for possible future use, are not billed at extra charge to the client. Any nutritional supplements and/or other supportive therapies drop shipped to the client from the supplement companies are not refundable once the order is placed with the company.. Homeopathic fee structures are much different than conventional veterinary fees, where animal guardians typically pay for a baseline physical exam fee or office visit fee of $75 to $150.00 , and then expensive diagnostic blood tests, x rays, ultrasound, and expensive, cook book drug therapies , which may amount to hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. Homeopathic fee structures are based on the much more extended time and study of each individual case, as well as the time and study involved in maintaining proficiency in not only constitutional homeopathic treatment, but also in conventional medical diagnostics and therapies, which Dr Dym has over 26 years of clinical experience. If, after the first homeopathic/holistic intake, or at any time during the course of homeopathic treatment, Dr Dym feels that a more integrative, \"eclectic\" holistic approach, OR even conventional medical approach is better suited for your animal companion(s), he will direct you in that direction and/or offer referrals to other holistic or conventional medical practitioners, who can provide these other veterinary services. Dr. Dym provides emailed recipes for all homeopathic services, consultations and products dispense, however Dr. Dym does not participate with veterinary pet insurance companies and providing detailed records for those services. All rescheduling or cancelling of appointments require 24 hours cancellation notice to Dr. Dym, or a $95.00 fee is billed to the credit card that has been stored on file. I have read and agreed to these guidelines for Dr Dym's holistic/homeopathic practice, and agree to these terms. I consent to homeopathic and/or holistic treatment of my animal. "}
