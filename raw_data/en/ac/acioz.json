The technique stems from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), and involves the use of a skincare tool (like this one!) with a flat edge that can be used to press-stroke or scrape lubricated skin in one direction. This, according to the Chinese, moves qi () or energy around the body. In allopathic medical terms, this translates into improving circulation which releases stagnant blood and toxins. This movement allows for more blood and nutrient flow to stagnant areas, allowing for healing and rejuvenating tired skin. This guasha is made using carefully sourced green aventurine. In crystal healing, green aventurine represents luck, abundance and happiness. It's also connected to issues of the heart and emotion, and is known as a stone of personal growth, to accept opportunities about learning about oneself and one's place in the universe. Instructions: Apply a facial oil or moisturizer on cleansed skin to give it some slip before using your gua sha tool. To use, anchor fingers from the opposing hand while scraping the tool from the center of the face to the ears and cheekbones.

The symbol The Chinese character (w) in the center of our gua shas signifies witchcraft or the spiritual arts. At Sabbatical, we believe the strongest magic we can find comes from within. For this reason, we've inscribed the symbol on our gua shas so that as you're conducting your gua sha ritual, you're reminded to tap into your own magic and your own intentions to heal your skin and speak your blessings over it. Being made of a crystal, these tools are delicate and will break upon being dropped. Please be careful while handling. To care for your crystal, gently wash it in warm soapy water after use each time and dry before putting it away. *Please note that as these tools are crafted from natural stone, there will be minor imperfections varying across individual units. These imperfections do not compromise the integrity of the tools or their use. I've been using various inexpensive guasha tools for over a year when I received this one. It is next level. The tool feels substantial in my hand, and glides better over my skin. I'm a firm believer in Gua Sha massage, but never used anything as nice as this one. I now feel that a quality tool can make a big difference. I love my guasha for my face, especially for my TMJ during times of stress. But I've recently started using it along my feet and legs up to my knees to find relief from plantar fasciitis. This little tool is extremely versatile! I'm not (yet) a long term user, but boy does this hit the spot as part of a nighttime face washing routine after a long day of writing. 7 hours of sitting in front of a screen gone! My skin did look nice and fresh afterwards. Love this tool, helps get my Vaccum Oil Cleanser or Bamboo Oil Cleanser to soak in deep down into my pores! Feels great cold and is a gentle massage. Has helped me de-stress so much! I was a big fan of the crystal facial roller and wasn't sure I also needed the guasha tool. After watching Adeline's videos, I decided to treat myself. As a chronic jaw clencher and migraine sufferer, I can't believe I've lived without this tool. In just a few minutes of massage, I can feel my jaw and neck muscles relaxing. I combine sweeping motions with more targeted massage on my most tense spots. The rounded corners provide many options for deep tissues massage around my temples, sinus, and jaw. I just gifted one to my SIL who grinds her teeth at night and I can't wait to hear how it helps. "}
