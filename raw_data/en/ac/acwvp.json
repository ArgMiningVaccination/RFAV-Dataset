Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-11-00311)]. The COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic has had severe social, health, and economic implications, and has put considerable strain on health systems. To prevent further morbidity and mortality, the COVID-19 vaccines were developed rapidly and rolled out in many countries in 2020-2021 to control the pandemic. By 28 December 2022, 69.1% of the world population has received at least one dose of the vaccine and 25.9% of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose [ [2](#B2-vaccines-11-00311)]. [3](#B3-vaccines-11-00311), [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00311)]. According to the SAGE (Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization) working group of the WHO, vaccine hesitancy is defined as \"the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite the availability of vaccination services\" [ [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00311)]. It exists on a continuous spectrum between complete refusal and complete acceptance [ [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00311)]. In 2019, the WHO identified low vaccine acceptance and the risk of a pandemic as two of the ten threats to global health [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00311)]. As the risk of emerging variants remains, low acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines is a threat to public health and is a factor in prolonging the pandemic until global herd immunity improves. [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00311)]. Protecting HCWs from the infection will reduce the risk to themselves, spread to close contacts, and prevent overwhelming health systems through increased staff absences. However, the rapid development of the vaccines has contributed to their low acceptance, fueled by concerns surrounding their safety and efficacy [ [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00311)]. As patient advisors, negative sentiments about the COVID-19 vaccine among HCWs and public health professionals could affect sentiments within the general population [ [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00311)]. Although public health professionals may not necessarily be in patient-facing roles, they are recognized as proponents of population health and immunization. Understanding factors that influence HCWs' and public health professionals' sentiments towards the COVID-19 vaccines facilitates broader understanding of their concerns, helps strategize ways to address them, and builds vaccine confidence. 2. Materials and Methods [Table A1](#vaccines-11-00311-t0A1)), resulting in 299 articles from PubMed and one grey literature report. The search was restricted to include only articles that were published in the English language since the beginning of the pandemic. The terms \"pregnant women*\", \"pregnan*\", and \"parent*\" was used along with the \"NOT\" Boolean operator in the search strategy to exclude studies on pregnant women and parents, resulting in 255 hits. Abstracts and titles were then screened for relevance. Articles on the general population that solely denote HCWs as an occupation, on students studying in healthcare, and on patients were excluded. Studies focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on influenza or other vaccine sentiments were also excluded. The articles that were included were peer-reviewed and focused on HCWs' sentiments on COVID-19 vaccination and the factors, barriers, or determinants to COVID-19 vaccination. Grey literature through google advanced search was conducted through which a report by PAHO (Pan-American Health Organization) was included. The detailed steps of the screening and selection process are outlined in [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-00311-f001). The major factors influencing the sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccination highlighted through the review are presented in the results. - Primary studies (cross-sectional, cohort, and longitudinal) and reviews (scoping reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analysis) with access to the full text; - Population: Healthcare workers or public health professionals; - Outcome: Articles examining the sentiments of HCWs towards COVID-19 vaccines and their uptake; - English language articles from any country. - Exclusion Criteria: - HCWs are solely listed as an occupational determinant of vaccine acceptance and there is no in-depth analysis of COVID-19 vaccination sentiments within this population; - Focus is not on the sentiments of HCWs regarding the COVID-19 vaccines; - Focus is on the influence of influenza on COVID-19 and not vice versa; - Inaccessible articles, letters, and non-original research articles were excluded. 3. Results 3.1. Characteristics and cohort studies were from Greece (n = 6), China (n = 5), France (n = 4), Turkey (n = 4), Italy (n = 4), Cyprus (n = 3), UK (n = 3), Germany (n = 2), Lebanon (n = 2), Spain (n = 2), Egypt (n = 2), the US (n = 2), Azerbaijan, Albania, Czech Republic, India, Iraq, Israel, Kosovo, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Switzerland, Tunisia, and the UAE in most articles were HCWs (n = 46), nurses (n = 6), dentists, midwives, pharmacists, pediatricians, and were conducted in the European region (n = 27), the Middle East (n = 12), and Asia (n = 7) COVID-19 vaccination uptake was found in an Italian cross-sectional study (98.9%) [ [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00311)]. Although the lowest rate was found in a global scoping review (20.7%) among nurses, a cross-sectional study among nurses and midwives in Cyprus had the lowest vaccine acceptance rate (30%) [ [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00311), [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00311)]. 3.2. Determinants of articles were from within the European region (n = 9/27) from France (n = 3/5), Greece (n = 2/6), and Spain (n = 6/12) were mostly from Turkey (n = 3/4), while otherstudies were from the UK (n = 2/3), and the US (n = similar results [ [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00311), [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00311), [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00311), [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00311), [35](#B35-vaccines-11-00311)]. On the contrary, Cyprus, Greece, and Saudi Arabia found that female HCWs were more accepting is followed by studies from other countries, such as Turkey (n = 3/4), and the UK (n = 2/3) [ [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00311), [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00311), [27](#B27-vaccines-11-00311), [58](#B58-vaccines-11-00311), [59](#B59-vaccines-11-00311), [62](#B62-vaccines-11-00311)]. In addition, five reviews and a multi-country study identified older age as [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00311), [32](#B32-vaccines-11-00311), [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00311), [35](#B35-vaccines-11-00311)]. HCWs of over 60 years of age were the most likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine compared to other age groups in studies from the UK, Germany, Switzerland, and Azerbaijan [ [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00311), [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00311), [43](#B43-vaccines-11-00311), [63](#B63-vaccines-11-00311)]. Contrastingly, five articles from Italy, China, Egypt, and Palestine found that younger HCWs (18-<30) are more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccines [ [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00311), [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00311), [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00311), [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00311), [37](#B37-vaccines-11-00311)]. Interestingly, the aforementioned Egyptian study reports higher acceptance among younger HCWs; however, it was not a predictor for COVID-19 vaccination found for the US (n = 2/2), China (n = 2/5), Turkey (n = 2/4), three of six reviews, a report by PAHO, and vaccine acceptance was lowest amongst nursing professionals, such as registered nurses, nursing associates, or auxiliary nurses (n = 18/56), within Europe (n = 7) in France (n = 2/5) and Italy (n were from the UK (n = 2/2) and a systematic review report that Black HCWs were less accepting of the vaccines [ [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00311), [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00311), [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00311), [59](#B59-vaccines-11-00311)]. For instance, a study performed in the UK found that out of the 23% of HCWs that were vaccine hesitant, Black Caribbean (43.1%), Mixed White and Black Caribbean (59.5%), Black African (60.2%), Chinese (65.6%), Pakistani (68.3%), and White other ethnic groups (69.0%) reported lower acceptance than those from the White British group (77.7%) [ [59](#B59-vaccines-11-00311)]. Furthermore, a UK-based study reports vaccination intent was significantly higher among Black HCWs compared to White, Indian, and other Asian HCWs [ [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00311)]. Some studies have contrasting results for Asian HCWs. A study conducted in the US found that Asian HCWs were less likely to be accepting than non-Hispanic White HCWs [ [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00311)]. In comparison, a rapid systematic review notes that Asians were more willing to be vaccinated compared to other groups [ [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00311)]. |Determinants||Total Studies HCWs with Master/Doctoral degrees and 88.4% with university-level degrees accepted the COVID-19 vaccine compared to 63.2% with high school level [ [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00311)]. However, one Turkish study notes that vaccination rates were the highest not only in HCWs with Master/Doctoral/Specialization education levels (90.5%) but also among primary school graduates (87%) followed by bachelor (80.4%), high school (77.6%), and secondary school graduates (78.5%) [ [27](#B27-vaccines-11-00311)]. College degree holders were 56% less likely to accept the vaccine compared to those with less than a college degree according to a US study [ from the US finds that vaccine acceptors were more likely to have hypertension, and vaccine hesitant individuals were more likely to have asthma [ [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00311)]. According to an Egyptian study, HCWs with chronic diseases were twice as likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine compared to healthy HCWs [ [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00311)]. Moreover, studies from Italy and the US each found that vaccine acceptance was associated with having diabetes, while one Saudi Arabian study reports that vaccine acceptance was lowest amongst those without chronic diseases [ [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00311), [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00311), [40](#B40-vaccines-11-00311)]. 3.3. Influenza Vaccination as a from Europe (n = 15); most commonly from France (n = 4/5), Greece (n = 3/6), Italy (n = 3/4), Spain (n = 2/2), and Cyprus (n = were from the Middle East, such as Turkey (n = 4/4), Lebanon (n = 2/2), Azerbaijan, Palestine, and the from China (n = 3/5), the UK (n = 2/3), and the US (n = 2/2), in addition to six the highest influenza vaccination rate (92.2%) together with a high COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate (94.9%) [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00311)]. The lowest influenza vaccine uptake was reported in Turkey (17.0%) amongst pharmacists [ [44](#B44-vaccines-11-00311)]. One study found that having received the influenza vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic was linked to a 12% increase in the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate [ [41](#B41-vaccines-11-00311)]. 3.4. Factors and Barriers of Intention to Taking a COVID-19 Vaccine [Table 3](#vaccines-11-00311-t003). Factors that positively influence uptake include psychological factors such as the fear of COVID-19 (n = 9/56), increased perception of risk (n = 11/56), and susceptibility of having increased susceptibility is related to the knowledge of belonging to an at-risk group and having a fear of developing a severe COVID-19 infection [ [42](#B42-vaccines-11-00311), [63](#B63-vaccines-11-00311)]. The most common reasons that motivate HCWs to vaccinate were to protect others, such as family, patients, or close contacts (n = 15/56), and for self-protection of collective and social responsibility to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases, bring the pandemic under control, and obtain herd immunity (n = also seems to be an underlying factor in vaccination intent. For instance, being knowledgeable of the COVID-19 vaccines is linked to vaccine acceptance (n = 11/56), such as knowledge regarding acquired immunity, vaccine types, side effects, preventive measures, etc. trust was identified to be an important element in vaccine acceptance. Having trust in the recommendations provided by the government, health authorities, scientists, or public health experts (n = 10/56), and trust in the safety of the vaccine (n = 9/56), are associated with vaccine information (n = 10/56) that was clear, transparent, and informative of the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine was a barrier to vaccination confirmed COVID-19 infection is associated with negative attitudes towards vaccination (n = to a low self-perception of risk due to an inaccurate belief that acquired immunity against the virus will indefinitely protect from future COVID-19 infection [ [49](#B49-vaccines-11-00311)]. A study that compared fear levels of COVID-19 found that vaccinated participants had significantly higher levels of fear than unvaccinated participants and were motivated by concerns about the disease itself compared to unvaccinated participants [ [54](#B54-vaccines-11-00311)]. Furthermore, the low perceived risk of infection severity (n = 6/56) was itself identified as a barrier to COVID-19 vaccination [ [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00311), [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00311), [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00311), [51](#B51-vaccines-11-00311), [52](#B52-vaccines-11-00311), [63](#B63-vaccines-11-00311)]. Additionally, a lack of trust in the government and health authorities also seems to play a significant role in HCWs' decision to vaccinate. Distrust in governments, health authorities, or pharmaceutical companies (n = 11/56) negatively affects vaccine confidence as vaccination campaigns are provided through these entities and may be further reinforced with misinformation and conspiracy theories by themselves convince HCWs of the benefits of vaccines and diminish trust in healthcare organizations and vaccination campaigns [ [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00311), [58](#B58-vaccines-11-00311)]. Several studies identified a variety of interventions that should be implemented alongside vaccination campaigns in a multi-pronged approach. For instance, interventions that are focused on raising awareness regarding the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine can be implemented through educational campaigns, training sessions, or seminars (n = 18) to improve knowledge information can be disseminated through public health messaging and communication campaigns (n = 19) marketing or mass media marketing (n = 7) can also be employed to improve uptake [ [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00311), [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00311), [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00311), [28](#B28-vaccines-11-00311), [37](#B37-vaccines-11-00311), [54](#B54-vaccines-11-00311), [64](#B64-vaccines-11-00311)]. of HCWs and following an individual-based approach during vaccination campaigns through targeted interventions (n = 11) towards sub-groups or non-vaccinated HCWs could lead to changes in sentiments about the interventions, improving access to vaccines, offering an incentive, building trust in vaccine manufacturers, and building resilience against misinformation were some of the other interventions recommended Factor for COVID-19 Vaccination [41](#B41-vaccines-11-00311), [47](#B47-vaccines-11-00311), [52](#B52-vaccines-11-00311)]. For instance, one study found that 86% of HCWs that had received the vaccine had taken Pfizer/BioNTech, while only 8.8% and 5.3% accepted Sinopharm and Sputnik V vaccines, respectively [ [41](#B41-vaccines-11-00311)]. When given multiple choices, HCWs that had yet not taken a COVID-19 vaccine, but were willing to accept one were most accepting towards Pfizer (71.9%), followed by [41](#B41-vaccines-11-00311)]. Similarly, a study from the UAE found that the most accepted vaccine was Pfizer/BioNTech (35%), followed by AstraZeneca (21%) and Sputnik V vaccines (4%) [ [52](#B52-vaccines-11-00311)]. Alternatively, another study from France notes that 24% of HCWs were concerned about mRNA vaccines [ [42](#B42-vaccines-11-00311)]. 4. Discussion [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00311), [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00311)]. The German study was conducted among nurses and midwives, and our analysis of the literature revealed that vaccine acceptance was lowest amongst nursing professions [ [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00311)]. This is concerning due to the prolonged contact between nurses and patients, contributing to a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, and a source of infection in nurses. A global scoping review among nurses reports that 23.4% and 18.3% of the nurses refused vaccines before the vaccine rollout (March 2020-December 2020) and after the COVID-19 vaccines were available (January 2021-May 2021), respectively [ [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00311)]. The studies included in the aforementioned review were conducted during the emergency use authorization of COVID-19 vaccines, which may contribute to the lower refusal acceptance rate [ [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00311)]. Additionally, the slight decrease in the refusal rate further supports SAGE's conclusion that that vaccine sentiments are dynamic and can change as time progresses [ [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00311)]. Increasing knowledge, popularity, the emergency use authorization of vaccines, and evidence of safety and effectiveness may have effected this change [ [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00311)]. Nurses are frontline workers and advocates for public health, thus determining their sentiments is important to improve vaccine acceptance. [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00311), [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00311), [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00311), [65](#B65-vaccines-11-00311)]. For instance, older age was identified as a determinant of vaccine acceptance, which may be related to experience in a healthcare setting, level of education, and the higher chance of having comorbidities [ [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00311), [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00311)]. Age is a risk factor for COVID-19, putting older HCWs at a higher risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 [ [66](#B66-vaccines-11-00311)]. Consequently, older HCWs may be motivated by their self-perceptions of vulnerability, and the knowledge of the benefits of vaccination [ [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00311), [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00311)]. Male HCWs are also more likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccines possibly due to a higher tendency to accept pharmaceutical measures [ [67](#B67-vaccines-11-00311)]. In addition, research shows that males are more likely to become seriously ill due to COVID-19 compared to women [ [68](#B68-vaccines-11-00311)]. Thus, being at a higher risk of adverse events could contribute to the higher uptake in males [ [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00311), [65](#B65-vaccines-11-00311)]. In addition, the type and level of education of HCWs may influence vaccine acceptance. One German study notes that higher education and medical training may allow individuals to discern between information and misinformation [ [43](#B43-vaccines-11-00311)]. Education may be connected to health literacy, leading to a better understanding of vaccine efficacy and safety [ [43](#B43-vaccines-11-00311)]. Thus, HCWs with lower education may have lower awareness and knowledge of vaccines and their benefits. Implementing interventions related to vaccine education to improve vaccine-related knowledge and health literacy will empower HCWs to make better informed vaccine-related decisions. [59](#B59-vaccines-11-00311)]. A report by PAHO notes that the topic of trust must be addressed among Black ethnic groups to build confidence in vaccines [ [64](#B64-vaccines-11-00311)]. This suggests that investigating vaccine acceptance among HCWs belonging to different ethnic groups may reveal different barriers, requiring interventions that are culturally sensitive and inclusive to improve vaccine uptake. [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00311)]. Another study from Italy reported there was a significant increase (% = 71.44) in influenza vaccination rate from the 2019-2020 campaign to the 2020-2021 campaign compared to campaigns before 2019 [ [46](#B46-vaccines-11-00311)]. The risk of dual infections of influenza and COVID-19 during the influenza season may have positively influenced HCWs to receive the influenza vaccine [ [69](#B69-vaccines-11-00311)]. [64](#B64-vaccines-11-00311)]. Another study from Lebanon notes that 77% of HCWs would be more positive about receiving the vaccines if they knew the type of vaccine [ [37](#B37-vaccines-11-00311)]. In addition, COVID-19 vaccine acceptance may change with context and as evidence of the effectiveness of the different types of vaccines against variants emerges. For instance, a French study notes that the controversies of severe vaccine-related thrombosis from the AstraZenca COVID-19 vaccine impacted vaccine acceptance when the first dose of the vaccine was made available [ [48](#B48-vaccines-11-00311)]. Interestingly, another French study notes that HCWs who had received at least one dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine were willing to receive a third dose as compared to those who had received at least one dose of the Moderna vaccine [ [47](#B47-vaccines-11-00311)]. This is possible due to evidence that emerged at the time that the AstraZeneca vaccine is sub-optimal against the delta variant, which was the dominant variant at the time when the study was conducted [ [48](#B48-vaccines-11-00311)]. This highlights the importance of conducting further studies to explore vaccine acceptance towards the different types or brands of COVID-19 vaccines and as new developments occur. One of the overarching findings was, to the best of our knowledge, no studies addressed public health professionals' sentiments. Just as with HCWs, public health professionals have an important role in advising, promoting vaccinations, and addressing low vaccine acceptance [ [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00311)]. This is uniquely so, as their primary role is to advocate for population health. Their knowledge and vaccination behavior is important to promote vaccinations among the general public [ [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00311)]. This gap in current research warrants investigation so as not to miss the crucial opportunity to address concerns that may exist within this population. 5.
