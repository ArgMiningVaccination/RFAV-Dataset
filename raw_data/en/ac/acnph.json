Our land boarders the Deuel Harvest Wind Project in Deuel county, Docket # EL 18-053. There are 112 towers cited in the project, with 9 towers within a mile of our property. We have spent over three decades developing this property to enhance wildlife and for the enjoyment of our family. Can you imagine how we felt when we found we have a population of eastern bluebirds? We have yellow warblers, which by the way feed on the web worms that form in our trees. We have orioles, cedar waxwings, brown thrashers, rose breasted grosbeaks, gold finches, purple finches, robins, blue jays, nuthatches, eastern kingbirds, bitterns, dark eyed juncos, red winged blackbirds, morning doves, owls, cow birds, northern mocking birds, grey cat birds, wood thrushes, woodpeckers, turkeys, turkey vultures, even humming birds and bald eagles. There are more, just to numerous to list. Many of these birds we have seen for the first time in our lives on this property in the past 1 O years. Not only are these birds beautiful and fun to watch, they have their purpose in the ecosystem. We also see northern long eared bats, that are on the endangered list in South Dakota. These birds are making a come back after the use of insecticides that nearly wiped out many. In the 1940's the insecticide DDT was introduced for public use, it is now banned from sale. In 1976 the herbicide Roundup was introduced to the public. Both we believed were safe. We did not know then what we know now. There is much negativity out there about wind turbines, should we look the other way when it comes to making safe decisions? So a hand full of people can gain financially? Would you personally like these 600 ft plus wind towers where your family lives or plays? I'm guessing not. If there is a chance that something might be hazardous to your health, wouldn't you stay far away from it? I'm guessing you would. My husband and I have owned and operated a steel construction company for over 45 years. We could live just about anywhere and still run our business. We chose to live in eastern South Dakota for all it has to offer a growing family. When our kids and grandkids now come home, they can't wait to go for a hike or 4-wheeler ride to see what birds and wildlife they can find. This is a great tool in teaching them about wildlife and the environment. Shouldn't we in South Dakota err on the side of caution when citing these projects? Keep them a safe distance away from these sensitive wildlife areas and away from people who don't want to be forced to live with them? Thank you for reading this letter and ...

Insecticides are used in _a_gr:i~ullllre, 111,eclici_ne, i_nclustry and by consumers. Insecticides are claimed to be a major factor behind the increase in the 20th-century's agricultural productivity.1 21 Nearly all insecticides have the potential to significantly alter ecosystems; many are toxic to humans and/ or animals; some become concentrated as they spread along the food chain. Insecticides can be classified into two major groups: systemic insecticides, which have residual or long term activity; and contact insecticides, which have no residual activity. Furthermore, one can distinguish three types of insecticide. 1. Natural insecticides, such as nicotine, pyrethrum and neem extracts, made by plants as defenses against insects. 2. Inorganic insecticides, which are metals. 3. Organic insecticides, which are organic chemical compounds, mostly working by contact. The mode of action describes how the pesticide kills or inactivates a pest. It provides another way of classifying insecticides. Mode of action is important in understanding whether an insecticide will be toxic to unrelated species, such as fish, birds and mammals. Insecticides may be repellent or non-repellent. Social insects such as ants cannot detect non-repellents and readily crawl through them. As they return to the nest they take insecticide with them and transfer it to their nestmates. Over time, this eliminates all of the ants including the queen. This is slower than some other methods, but usually completely eradicates the ant colony.131 Insecticides are distinct from non-insecticidal repellents, which repel but do not kill.

When insects feed on the plant, they ingest the insecticide. Systemic insecticides produced by transgenic plants are called plant-incorporated protectants (PIPs). For instance, a gene that codes for a specific Bacillus thuringiensis biocidal protein was introduced into corn (maize) and other species. The plant manufactures the protein, which kills the insect when consumed.141 Contact insecticides are toxic to insects upon direct contact. These can be inorganic insecticides, which are metals and include arsenates, copper and fluorine compounds, which are less commonly used, and the commonly used sulfur. Contact insecticides can be organic insecticides, i.e. organic chemical compounds, synthetically produced, and comprising the largest numbers of pesticides used today. Or they can be natural compounds like pyrethrum, neem oil etc. Contact insecticides usually have no residual activity. Efficacy can be related to the quality of pesticide application, with small droplets, such as aerosols often improving performance.151 Biological pesticides Many organic compounds are produced by plants for the purpose of defending the host plant from predation. A trivial case is tree rosin, which is a natural insecticide. Specifically, the production of oleoresin by conifer species is a component of the defense response against insect attack and fungal pathogen infection.161 Many fragrances, e.g. oil of wintergreen, are in fact antifeedants. https:// en .wi kip ed o rg/wi ki/1 nsecti c id e#B i rd_d ec 2 of 11 Insecticide -Wikipedia 1/21/19, 11:09 AM ,, ' \"'I, in commercial nse: )2,'l'.etl1J::ttlll, roteno11e, \"\"_elll_c,i!, and various e,ss_.,11tialojJ,;l7l Other biological approaches Plant-incorporated protectants Transgenic crops that act as insecticides began in 1996 with a gene,tic~lly modified pClt~!_o that prodnced the Cry P.!\"t_ei11, derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringie11si.\", which is toxic to beetle l~i:ya\" such as the C_o]Clrado potato_!ie_etl_e_.

The technique is expected to replace many other insecticides, which are losing effectiveness due to the spread of pesticide resistance. [Bl Enzymes Many plants exude substances to repel insects.

Insecticides represent a major area of emphasis. Many of the major insecticides are inspired by biological analogues. Many others are completely alien to nature. Organochlorides The best known organochloride, DDT, was created by Swiss scientist Paul Miiller. For this discovery, he was awarded the 1948 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.f10] DDT was introduced in 1944. It functions by opening sodium channels in the insect's !!_\"1:Y<\" cells.l111 The contemporaneous rise of the chemical industry large-scale production of DDT and related chlorinated !!,'drocarbons. Organophosphates and carbamates Organophosphates are another large class of contact insecticides. These also target the insect's nervous system. Organophosphates interfere with the ~es acetylcholinesterase and other cholinesterases, disrupting nerve impulses and killing or disabling the insect. Organophosphate insecticides and chemical warfare nerve agents (suclt as sarin, tabnn, soman, and VX) work in the same way. Organophosphates have a cumulative toxic effect to wildlife, so multiple exposures to the chemicals amplifies the toxicity.f121 In the US, organophosphate use declined with the rise of substitutes.f131 Carbamate insecticides have similar mechanisms to organophosphates, but have a much shorter duration of action and are somewhat less toxic. Pyrethroids Pyrethroid pesticides mimic the insecticidal activity of the natural compound pyrethrum, the biopesticide found in pyrethrins. These compounds are nonpersistent sodium channel modulators and are less toxic than organophosphates and carbamates. Compounds in this group are often applied against household pests.f141 Neonicotinoids Neonicotinoids are synthetic analogues of the natural insecticide nicotine (with much lower acute manunalian toxicity and greater field persistence). These chemicals are acetylcholine receptor \"llonists. They are broad-spectrnm systemic insecticides, with rapid action (minutes-hours). They are applied as sprays, drenches, seed and soil treatments. Treated insects exhibit leg tremors, rapid wing motion, stylet withdrawal (aphids), disoriented movement, paralysis and deathJ151 Imidacloprid may be the most common. It has recently come under scrutiny for allegedly pernicious effects on honeybeesl161 and its potential to increase the susceptibility of rice to planthopper attacksJ171 Ryanoids Ryanoids are synthetic analogues with the same mode of action as ryanodine, a naturally occurring insecticide extracted from Ryania speciosa (Flacourtiaceae). They bind to calcium channels in cardiac and skeletal muscle, blocking nerve transmission. The first insecticide from this class to be registered was Rynaxypyr, generic name chlorantraniliproleJ181 Insect growth regulators https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lnsecticide#Bird_decline Page 4 of 11 Insecticide -Wikipedia 1/21/19, 11:09 AM ' ' \" Insect growth regulator (!GR) is a term coined to include insect hormone mimics aod an earlier class of chemicals, the benzoylphenyl ureas, which inhibit chitin (exoskeleton) biosynthesis in insectsl191 Diflubenzuron is a member of the latter class, used primarily to control caterpillars that are pests. The most successful insecticides in this class are the juvenoids Guvenile hormone analogues). Of these, methoprene is most widely used. It has no observable acute toxicity in rats and is approved by World Health Organization (WHO) for use in drinking water cisterns to combat malaria. Most of its nses are to combat insects where the adult is the pest, including mosquitoes, several fly species, aod !'[__!'as, Two very similar products, hydroprene and kinoprene, are used for controlling species such as cockroaches aod white flies. Methoprene was registered with the EPA in 1975. Virtually no reports of resistance have been filed. A more recent type of !GR is the ecdysone agonist tebufenozide (MIMIC), which is used in forestry and other applications for control of caterpillars, which are far more sensitive to its hormonal effects thao other insect orders. Environmental harm Effects on nontarget species Some insecticides kill or harm other creatures in addition to those they are intended to kill. For example, birds may be poisoned when they eat food that was recently sprayed with insecticides or when they mistake an insecticide graoule on the ground for food and eat it.l' 21 Sprayed insecticide may drift from the area to which it is applied and into wildlife areas, especially when it is sprayed aerially.l121 DDT The development of DDT was motivated by desire to replace more daogerous or less effective alternatives. DDT was introduced to replace lead and arsenic-based compounds, which were in widespread use in the early 194os,l20] ----- DDT was brought to public attention by Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring, One side-effect of DDT is to reduce the thickness of shells on the eggs of predatory birds. The shells sometimes become too thin to be viable, reducing bird populations. This occurs with DDT and related compounds dne to the process of bioaccumulation, wherein the chemical, due to its stability and fat solubility, accumulates in organisms' fatty tissues. Also, DDT may biomagnify, which causes progressively higher concentrations in the body fat of animals farther up the food chain. The near-worldwide ban on agricultural use of DDT and related chemicals has allowed some of these birds, such as the peregrine falcon, to recover in recent years. A nnmber of organochlorine pesticides have been banned from most uses worldwide. Globally they are controlled via the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants. These Insecticides can kill bees and may be a cause of pollinator decline, the loss of bees that pollinate plants, and colony collapse disorder (CCD),l211 in which worker bees from a beehive or Western honey bee colony abruptly disappear. Loss of pollinators means a reduction in crop yields.l211 Sublethal doses of insecticides (i.e. inlidacloprid and other neonicotinoids) affect bee foraging behavior.l221 However, research into the causes of CCD was inconclusive as of June 2007_l231 Bird decline htt ide#Bird_ d ec e Page 5 of 11 Insecticide -Wikipedia 1/21/19, 11,09 AM ' Besides the effects of direct consumption of insecticides, populations of insectivorous birds decline due to the collapse of their prey populations. Spraying of especially wheat and corn in Europe is believed to have caused an So per cent decline in flying insects, which in turn has reduced local bird populations by a third to two thirds.1241 Alternatives Instead of using chemical insecticides to avoid crop damage caused by insects, there are many alternative options available now that can protect farmers from major economic losses.1251 Some of them are: 1. Breeding crops resistant, or at least less susceptible, to pest attacks.I26I 2. Releasing predators, parasitoids, or pathogens to control pest populations as a form of biological control.I27l 3. Chemical control like releasing pheromones into the field to confuse the insects into not being able to find mates and reproduce.1281 4. Integrated Pest Management- using multiple techniques in tandem to achieve optimal results.I291 5. Push-pull technique- intercropping with a \"push\" crop that repels the pest, and planting a \"pull\" crop on the boundary that attracts and traps WIKIPEDIA Roundup (herbicide) Roundup is name of a systemic, broad-spectrum glyphosate\u00ad based herbiciQ~ originally produced by the American company Monsanto, which was acquired by 13.:JY~~ in 2018.[21 Q!UJhosate is the most widely used herbicide iu the United States.131 As of 2009, sales of Roundup herbicides still represented about 10% of Monsanto's revenue despite competition from Chinese producers of other glyphosate-based herbicides;[41 the overall Roundup line of products ( which includes genetically . modified seeds) represented about half of Monsanto's yearly revenue.[51 Monsanto developed and pll_!':!Il!~d the glyphosate molecule in the 1970s, and marketed Roundup from 1973. It retained exclusive rights to glyphosate in the US until its US patent expired iu September, 2000; in other countries the patent expired earlier. The Roundup trademark is registered with the US Patent Office and still extant. However, glyphosate is no longer under patent, so similar products use it as an active ingredient.161 As of January 2019, \"the sale, distribution, and use of Roundup 360 is banned\" in FranceFI The main active ingredient of Roundup is the is<JJ>.r()pylami11~ ~:i.1! of g!YPhosate. POEA (polyethoxylated tallow amine). Monsanto also produced seeds which grow into plants genetically engineered to be tolerant to glyphosate, which are known as Roundup Ready crops.

As a result, the effects of this herbicide are not with the main active ingredient alone, but with complex and variable mixtures.f8l Acute toxicity Roundup contains the surfactant polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA), which makes it more toxic for aquatic species than some other glyphosate formulations.f9U1Dl Independent scientific reviews and regulatory agencies have regularly concluded that glyphosate-based herbicides do not lead to a significant risk for human or environmental health when the product label is properly followed, l11 l Human The acute oral toxicity for mammals is low,l9l but death has been reported after deliberate overdose of concentrated Roundup.f12l The surfactants in glyphosate formulations can increase the relative acute toxicity of the formulation.l13l Surfactants generally do not, however, cause synergistic effects (as opposed to additive effects) that increase the acute toxicity of glyphosate within a formulationJ131 The surfactant POEA is not considered an acute toxicity hazard, and has an oral toxicity similar to vitamin A and less toxic than ~J14l Deliberate ingestion of Roundup ranging from 85 to 200 ml (of 41% solution) has resulted in death within hours of ingestion, although it has also been ingested in quantities as large as 500 ml with only mild or moderate symptoms.f15l Consumption of over 85 ml of concentrated product is likely to cause serious symptoms in adults, including burns due to corrosive effects as well as kidney and liver damage. More severe cases lead to \"respiratory distress, impaired consciousness, pulmonary edema, infiltration on chest X-ray, shock, arrhythmias, renal failure requiring haemodialysis, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalaemia\" and death is often preceded by bradycardia and ventricular arrhythmiasJ13l Skin exposure can cause irritation, and photocontact dermatitis has been occasionally reported. Severe skin burns are very rareJ13l In a 2017 risk assessment, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) wrote: \"There is very limited information on skin irritation in humans. Where skin irritation has been reported, it is unclear whether it is related to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundup_(herbicide) Page 2 of 9 Roundl'\"i (herbicide) -Wikipedia \\ glyphosate-containing herbicide formulations.\" The ECHA concluded that available human data was insufficient to support classification for skin corrosion or irritationJ16l Inhalation is a minor route of exposure, but spray mist may cause oral or nasal discomfort, an unpleasant taste in the mouth, or tingling and irritation in the throat. Eye exposure may lead to mild conjunctivitis. Superficial corneal injury is possible if irrigation is delayed or inadequateJ131 Aquatic Glyphosate formulations with POEA, such as Roundup, are not approved for aquatic use due to aquatic organism toxicity.[17l Due to the presence of POEA, glyphosate formulations only allowed for terrestrial use are more toxic for amphibians and fish than glyphosate aloneJ17J[18U19l Terrestrial glyphosate formulations that include the surfactants POEA and MON 0818 (75% POEA) may have negative impacts on various aquatic organisms like protozoa, mussels, crustaceans, frogs and fishJ9l Aquatic organism exposure risk to terrestrial formulations with POEA is limited to drift or tempoiary water pocketsJ17l While laboratory studies can show effects of glyphosate formulations on aquatic organisms, similar observations rarely occur in the field when instructions on the herbicide label are followed.[11] Studies in a variety of amphibians have shown the toxicity of products containing POEA to amphibian larvae. These effects include interference with gill morphology and mortality from either the loss of osmotic stability or asphyxiation. At sub-lethal concentrations, exposure to POEA or glyphosate/POEA formulations have been associated with delayed development, accelerated development, reduced size at metamorphosis, developmental malformations of the tail, mouth, eye and head, histological indications of intersex and symptoms of oxidative stressJ19l Glyphosate-based formulations can cause oxidative stress in bullfrog tadpolesP01 The use of glyphosate-based pesticides are not considered the major cause of amphibian decline, the bulk of which occurred prior to widespread use of glyphosate or in pristine tropical areas with minimal glyphosate exposure. [21 l A 2000 review of the toxicological data on Roundup concluded that \"for terrestrial uses of Roundup minimal acute and chronic risk was predicted for potentially exposed nontarget organisms\". It also concluded that there were some risks to aquatic organisms exposed to Roundup in shallow waterJ22l Carcinogenicity There is limited evidence that human cancer risk might increase as a result of occupational exposure to large amounts of glyphosate, such as agricultural work, but no good evidence of such a risk from home use, such as in domestic gardeningJ23l The consensus among national pesticide regulatory agencies and scientific organizations is that labeled uses of glyphosate have demonstrated no evidence of human carcinogenicityJ24ll25l Organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization, European Commission, Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency, and the Gernian Federal Institute for Risk Assessmentl26l have concluded that there is no evidence that glyphosate poses a carcinogenic or genotoxic risk to humans.1241 The final assessment of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority in 2017 was that \"glyphosate does not pose a carcinogenic risk to humans\" J24ll27l The EPA has classified glyphosate as Group E, meaning \"evidence of non-carcinogenicity in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundup_(herbicide) Page 3 of 9 Roundup (herbicide) -Wikipedia Q 1/21/1_f )7,-q PM ' -_.J ' humans\" .124ll281 Only one international scientific organization, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), affiliated with the WHO, has made claims of carcinogenicity in research reviews. The IARC has been criticized for its assessment methodology by failing to consider the broad literature and only assessing hazard rather than risk.[241 Legal On 10 Augnst 2018, Dewayne Johnson, who has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, was awarded $289 million in damages after a jury in San Francisco found that Monsanto had failed to adequately warn consumers of cancer risks posed by the herbicide,[291 a decision the company plans on appealingJ301 Johnson had routinely used two different glyphosate formulations in his work as a groundskeeper, Roundup and another Monsanto product called Ranger Pro.[31][321 The jury's verdict addressed the question of whether Monsanto knowingly failed to warn consumers that RoundUp could be harmful, but not whether RoundUp causes cancer.[331 Court documents from the case show the company's efforts to influence scientific research via ghostwritingJ341 After the IARC classified glyphosate as \"probably carcinogenic\" in 2015, over 300 federal lawsuits have been filed that were consolidated into a multidistrict litigation called In re: Roundup Products Liabi/ity.[351 False advertising In 1996, Monsanto was accused of false and misleading advertising of glyphosate products, prompting a law suit by the New York State attorney general.1361 Monsanto had made claims that its spray-on glyphosate based herbicides, including Roundup, were safer than table salt and \"practically non-toxic\" to manunals, birds, and fish, \"environmentally friendly\", and \"biodegradable\".13711381 Citing avoidance of costly litigation, Monsanto settled the case, admitting no wrongdoing, and agreeing to remove the offending advertising claims in New York State.1381 Environmental and consumer rights campaigners brought a case in France in 2001 accusing Monsanto of presenting Roundup as \"biodegradable\" and claiming that it \"left the soil clean\" after use; glyphosate, Roundup's main ingredient, was classed by the European Union as \"dangerous for the environment\" and \"toxic for aquatic organisms\". In January 2007, Monsanto was convicted of false advertising and fined 15,000 euros. The result was confirmed in 2009J391[40J Falsification of test results Some tests originally conducted on glyphosate by contractors were later found to be have been fraudulent, along with tests conducted on other pesticides. Concerns were raised about toxicology tests conducted by Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories in the 197os1411 and Craven Laboratories was found to have fraudulently analysed samples for residues of glyphosate in 1991.1421 Monsanto has stated that the studies have since been repeatedJ431 Ban in France In January 2019, Roundup 360 was banned in France following a court ruling that regulator ANSES had not given due weight to safety concerns when they approved the product in March 2017. The ban went into effect immediately.144][?] http s ://en .wi ki ped ia .org/wiki/Ro u ndup_ (herb ic id e) Page 4 of 9 "}
