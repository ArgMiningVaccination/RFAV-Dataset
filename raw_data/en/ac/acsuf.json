From full calendars of engaging activities to connected care opportunities, seniors with a variety of needs can find the lifestyle option that fits them. San Diego nursing homes and senior care facilities San Diego nursing homes or skilled nursing facilities are staffed with doctors and nurses that provide seniors with round-the-clock supervision and skilled medical care. Skilled nursing facilities may also coordinate hospice and rehabilitation services for seniors. Rehabilitation services are designed for seniors recovering from surgery or an illness. Skilled nursing facilities as well as assisted living communities have a range of rehabilitative therapies available on-site. These therapies often include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Residents of these San Diego facilities may also find unique options, such as acupuncture, massage therapy, and certified therapy dogs. All of our San Diego assisted living and memory care communities should provide a least some on-site nursing care services to current residents, equivalent to the services received at a skilled nursing facility.

For example, residents already in an assisted living community that grow to need rehabilitation or hospice care can receive such care services in the comfort of their own unit. Seniors who aren't recovering from surgery or an illness, aren't in need of hospice care, and don't require 24/7 medical oversight should look at assisted living communities \u2014 not nursing homes \u2014 to meet their current and future needs.
