Example s: Viewing nature: Improves concentration, remedies mental fatigue, improves psychological health , (Kaplan, Ulrich, Rohde and Kendle). Reduces stress , and improves stress recovery, boosts immune system, (Ulrich, Kendle, Parsons). Reduces incidence of reported illness at work, improves job satisfaction, (Kaplan and Kaplan).

Collaboration with the environmental management Health and Wellbeing Board, March 22nd 2018 Benefits of Parks, Green Space and Nature James JM Brown, CMLI, March 2018 sector , and the use of public natural spaces in population health promotion is a clear potential strategy. As demonstrated through this review, the individual and community benefits arising from contact with nature include biological, mental, social, environmental and economic outcomes. Nature can be seen therefore as an under -utilized public resource in terms of human health and well -being, with the use of parks and natural areas offering a potential gold mine for population health promotion. In this light, natural areas can b e seen as one of our most vital health resources. In the context of the growing worldwide mental illness burden of disease, contact with nature may offer an affordable, accessible and equitable choice in tackling the imminent epidemic, within both preventa tive and restorative public health strategies \". ii) Healt hy parks, healthy people: the health benefits of contact with nature in a park context.

(Forward) \"...recent research shows that \"green nature\", such as parks, can re duce crime, foster psychological wellbeing, reduce stress, boost immunity, enhance productivity and promote healing. In fact, the positive effects on human health, particularly in urban environments, cannot be over -stated. As a result, urban planning shoul d ensure that the communities have adequate access to nature\" (Executive Summary). https://www.deakin.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/310750/HPHP -2nd-Editi on.pdf Recommendations : \"Develop ways of integrating parks and nature into public health Cooperation through a partnerships approach is required between government departments, park management agencies, health professionals, and researchers to successful ly integrate parks and nature in public health; Health promotion agencies have already recognised the need for innovative, 'upstream' approaches to health and wellbeing, and are seeking potential alliances/opportunities to this end; It may be benecial t o initiate this process by examining how contact with nature via parks could be used as a preventive measure, potentially contributing to, for example, the Australian National Health Priority Areas of Cardiovascular Disease and Mental Health; The use of p arks and nature to improve health and wellbeing is supported by the Jakarta Declaration (World Health Organization, 1997) and its predecessor, the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion (World Health Organization, 1986) which calls for creating supportive env ironments (both natural and social) and a reorientation of health services to be shared among individuals, community groups, health professionals, health service institutions, and governments \".
