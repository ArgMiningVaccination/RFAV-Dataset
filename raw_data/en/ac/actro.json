Welcome to our weekly roundup of student comments on our recent [writing prompts](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/learning-writing-prompts). We asked teenagers whether schools should require students to get the [coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/us/coronavirus-public-schools.html) vaccine and we were impressed with the thoughtfulness and range of perspectives they expressed. We also invited them to tell us about the things that remind them of their childhoods and to write the opening of a short story inspired by an image we titled \"In the Waves.\" Thank you to all those who joined the conversation this week, including teenagers from Loveland, Colo.; Hyattsville, Md.; and Bentonville West High School in Centerton, Ark. Please note: Student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear as they were originally submitted. _________ Should Schools Require Students to Get the Coronavirus Vaccine? On Sept. 9, Los Angeles became the [first major school district to require coronavirus vaccines for students](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/09/us/la-vaccine-mandate-students-schools.html) 12 and older who are attending class in person. While some welcomed the decision, it has also resulted in pushback from vaccine-hesitant parents and students, and sparked a broader conversation about school-mandated coronavirus vaccination in general. [We asked teenagers](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/learning/schools-vaccine-mandates.html) if they think schools should require students to get the coronavirus vaccine. Do they feel such mandates are important to keep students safe? Or do they believe it should be up to individual families to decide? Students Should Not Be Required to Get the Vaccine to Attend School. I don't think students should be forced to get the vaccine to attend school. I think students should have a choice. \u2014 [Hyan, Atrisco Heritage Academy High School](https://nyti.ms/39uIs9l#permid=114657910) If mandatory vaccinations are used to limit access to education, then wouldn't that be violating American ideals? If America is supposed to be the land of opportunity where destiny is in our own hands, then does it make since for a newly developed vaccine to hamper such basic rights? America is supposedly built on freedom, so how do mandatory vaccines reflect such pillars of our culture? Especially seeing as how this might violate practices of numerous religions...The country just isn't ready for such enforcement. As a Californian, the Los Angeles vaccine mandate comes as no surprise; my own school district has followed rigorous mask and social distancing policies that don't look to be letting up soon. There is no question to me that increased practices of public health safety are crucial in tamping down the coronavirus. I worry, however, about the absence of a government-approved vaccine for many of the students who now have to abide by the vaccine mandate. I don't think that the district's 12-to-15-year-olds should have to choose between attending school or receiving a shot that isn't yet officially approved. \u2014 [Charlotte, Design Tech High School, CA](https://nyti.ms/39wmp2c#permid=114551035) Vaccine Mandates Will Make Schools \u2014 and Communities \u2014 Safer. Having such a mandate would not only lower the risk of bringing the virus home to loved ones, but also create a more comfortable, save environment for all students. A student's mind should be on learning, rather than what door handles not to touch. Without context, I would believe this is unfair, however, if for example the measles vaccine is required, why not in this case? School systems have had no problems with requiring other immunizations, many of which that are no longer a widespread threat to kids. This must be done urgently; this can't go on for much longer and change is needed. It's not just lives that are at stake, but also futures. While many argue that the decision should utterly belong to the guardians of each student, the resistance when it comes to the vaccine reflects ignorance toward the health of not only the people around the unvaccinated student, but the families that students go home to at the end of the day. I do not believe that the vaccine mandate is excessive. At the end of the day, Los Angeles is striving to keep each student and their community safe through the vaccine\u2014 an FDA approved medication. \u2014 [Clare, Glenbard West High School](https://nyti.ms/2W93uHI#permid=114568866) I agree with the decision to mandate vaccines for schools. Mandates for other, less prevalent diseases, such as chickenpox, measles, mumps and polio are commonplace in America. I see no reason why Covid-19, a dangerous and widespread virus that has killed over 600,000 Americans, should be the exception to the rule. Vaccination is a no-brainer that will help keep students and faculty safe, inhibit the spread of Covid-19, and prevent future school shut-downs (which have had a negative effect on students academically, especially low-income students and students of color). For the most part, I agree, I think it's for the best to keep students and staff safe. Requiring vaccines is not crazy because like it says in the article \"'All 50 states mandate vaccines for school attendance, such as those that protect against polio, measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.'\". These mandated vaccines prove that getting to a herd immunity works, and as always those who are anti-vaccination or don't want to get the vaccine will find loopholes or ways to get around the mandate. So in the end I think mandating the vaccine is fine and the controversy surrounding it will slowly fade as it becomes more and more normal. The Vaccine Should Be a Choice. As someone who is fully vaccinated, I think it is important for everyone to get the vaccine. Although, I feel it should definitely be on your own terms. If you aren't comfortable getting the vaccine because it hasn't been government approved for your age group, then that is understandable. However, if it has been approved for your age group, then you should highly consider getting it. The vaccine helps put you at less of a risk of getting covid and spreading covid to other people. While I think getting the vaccine is the right choice, making the vaccine mandatory for schools could potentially be forcing someone to do something to their body that they're uncomfortable with, and that is not ok. \u2014 [Krista, Valley Stream North High School](https://nyti.ms/2Zj94s1#permid=114572448) Although our country is currently struggling right now during the pandemic, I do not think it should be mandatory for students to receive the coronavirus vaccination and it should be an option. As someone who isn't fully vaccinated yet I understand both sides of the argument. Even though a vaccine might help, no one is one hundred percent sure of the outcome yet. In the article, it states that \"no coronavirus vaccine for children ages 12 to 15 has received full government approval.\" This is something that many parents' are worried about when thinking about giving their child the vaccine. This is why I think that the schools should not require vaccines for students. I don't think students should be required to get the vaccine. I believe that getting it is a choice for the student and their family. If you feel the need to get the vaccine then by all means go and get it, but no one should be forced into getting it if they would not like it or if they feel uncomfortable with getting it. Everyone has the right to decide whether they want to get the vaccine or not, and by requiring it at school that would be taking their right away. Weighing Arguments For and Against Vaccine Mandates. As I write this, the pandemic barrels on, ever more potent from the rise of the more infectious Delta variant. While safety is paramount in this time, another year of remote learning would have devastating effects in a generation of students. In schools, I both support and oppose vaccine mandates for students. I support them from a safety standpoint. Student bodies are packed into close quarters in hallways and classrooms. Given the size of the buildings we have, this is difficult to change. Masks improve our situation, but there is only one measure to truly keep us safe: vaccines. At the moment, they remain the most potent protection we have against the virus. While there are concerns for rare side effects, the observed long-term side effects of the coronavirus are far more daunting, statistically. However, I disagree with approach of a mandate. Forcing action only brews resentment, especially with the American culture prioritizing freedom. A better approach would be to offer the option of remaining unvaccinated, but with stipulations like weekly testing or only an online option. This maintains safety while encouraging vaccination\u2014who wants to jump through all the hoops when couple of shots is the easy way through? \u2014 [Ethan, Glenbard West High School, IL](https://nyti.ms/3hYPQPc#permid=114575962) While the hesitation behind vaccinations is understandable, it should be made clear that the vaccines have been proven to do more good than harm. Schools are widely known to be crowded and can serve as a spot for COVID-19 to spread easily through students being the carriers. Parents worry that these vaccines will cause harmful side effects and endanger their kids and argue that vaccinations should be left up to individual decisions but, they fail to take into note that researchers throughout have scientifically proven positive outcomes on vaccine takers. Furthermore, with mandated vaccines, schools can finally return to being the safe learning environments they once were. We have the facts and we have the resources. Take it and keep those around you safe. I don't believe that all arguments against the vaccine are equal. I do believe that some of the concern from black and brown people are valid since we do have a long of history of being exploited by the medical industry and those exploitations still have effects to this day, but I do believe that vaccines are a different story. There have been different vaccines developed and proven to work such as the measles and mumps. I don't think that people who try to make this vaccine something political or conspiratorial without any basis or reasoning have any valid argument against the vaccine. I believe that they're just trying to spread fear throughout the community which isn't smart since people are already scared. This uncertainty about the vaccine causes a lot of anxiety and confusion and makes people question whether it does protect us. This fear is not abnormal, when the first chickenpox vaccine was introduced in Europe, people were very doubtful and felt that it should not be mandated, but over time when people began to understand it, they were fine mandating it for their children. The coronavirus vaccine has been released to the public for such a small amount of time and that causes a lot of resistance when people are required to take something so new and untested especially when they believe it goes against the rights our country has provided them. \u2014 [Ellie, Bentonville West High School](https://nyti.ms/2XTWFKN#permid=114644102) _________ What Things Remind You of Your Childhood? In the comic \" [Nostalgia, Inc.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/business/nostalgia-inc.html),\" Julia Rothman and Shaina Feinberg illustrate the story of a couple who opened a store to sell old things that remind people of their childhoods. [We wanted to know](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/learning/what-things-remind-you-of-your-childhood.html) about the toys, mementos and other memories that bring students back to their younger years. They told us about basketball games, much-loved songs, hot air balloon rides, trips to visit family, \"fish pancakes\" and much more. We loved how their stories captured exactly what nostalgia feels like \u2014 wonder, wistfulness, and a bit of sadness for the years that, looking back now, seem so carefree. The Places That Transport Us Back to Childhood Moments The family-owned convenience store two blocks away from my house reminds me of my childhood. The owners have watched me blossom into the young woman I have become; they continue to do so to this day. Every day after school, my friends and I would run to the market and grab all kinds of junk food. We'd always make sure to buy the following: Airheads Extreme, Hot Cheetos, Sunny D's, and best of all, the business owner's pre-cut mangoes. Whenever my dad had time in the mornings, he would take me and my sister to the convenience store; We would buy Rice Krispies and delicious Yoo-hoo chocolate milk. Now, every time I enter the store, I still feel like that little girl watching all the adults playing the lottery as I place the same items I've always ordered on the counter. This convenience store will always be a memorable place to me. The place that will always bring me back to the times where the only concern I had was if the store was still in stock on my favorite snack. I have been attending UNC basketball games since I was three years old back when I had to wear ear muffs at the game. Football games, camps, and even just walking around the campus streets bring a certain feeling to me. The overall intensity of the basketball games can lift up your spirit. The smells of Chick-fil-a sandwiches, hot dogs, and ice cream fill the stands. As I walk along the campus sidewalks with the cold winter breeze brushing against my face, I feel the nostalgia of all of my visits to the area. \u2014 [Joseph, Hoggard Highschool, Wilmington NC](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/learning/what-things-remind-you-of-your-childhood.html#commentsContainer&permid=114643544) Adventures From Long Ago Something that is not a toy that reminds me of my childhood are utility poles and borders. Growing up I would always travel to Guatemala because that's where I am from and where I migrated from. My parents made sure that I would never forget where I came from and my culture so we would go every year. Since we did not have enough money for plane tickets we would make the long road trip over there. We'd travel in school buses to be able to take goodies from here to my family in Guatemala. Traveling on the bus meant it was a 7 day travel and the only thing me and my brother had as entertainment was pretending the utility poles were monsters. I remember sitting at the front of the bus with my brother imagining the poles turning into monsters and sometimes even my dad would join in, it's so silly but I can remember it like it was yesterday. Crossing the border also reminds me of my childhood because I would do it so often that it turned into a normal thing for me. All the migration checks, passport stamps and all the long lines turned into a huge part of my childhood. Now whenever I see a utility pole or cross the border all I think about are my childhood adventures to Guatemala. \u2014 [Dulce, Atrisco Heritage Academy High School](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/learning/what-things-remind-you-of-your-childhood.html#commentsContainer&permid=114609067) When I was younger I remember being so excited when I got to walk in the streets because there was too much snow on the road to drive. I remember asking my mom if this was allowed and being ecstatic when she said yes. Every time it snows heavily, when there is too much snow and there are no cars on the streets, I go out of my way to walk on them just for that reminder of when I was so surprised that I could walk through the streets. Every windy, sunny day brings back childhood memories of my annual hot air balloon rides. Growing up, I would eagerly wait for spring to arrive, so I could finally ride in the hot air balloon. My older sister and I would always go on these rides together and it became a bonding experience for us... When I stepped into the hot air balloon and it gradually started to lift upward, the wind, the air, the scenery felt unlike anything I had ever experienced. It was breathtaking and I was in awe of nature. A wave of tranquility and peacefulness had come over me and I knew at that moment I wanted to have similar experiences when I grew up. I knew I wanted to travel and see what else our world has to offer. Objects That Symbolize Being a Kid The living room was carpeted\u2014this nasty supposed-to-be-white but somehow yellow and moldy carpet, that my mom could never manage to get cleaned. She vacuumed and hired cleaners, poured baking soda to absorb the rotten smell\u2014every possible thing you could think of to try to fix a carpet. But it would not be fixed. While my mom hated that carpet, my siblings and I rolled around on it, did cartwheels on it, built blanket forts over it, and slept on top of it. That carpet was a luxury to my siblings and I. A place of comfort and adventures, no matter how gross my mom complained it was. I have not lived in a carpeted house since, so every time I walk into a friend's house and feel the soft cushion under my toes, I am reminded of my elementary years, of care-free happiness, and that most of all that smelly old carpet. \u2014 [Cassidy, Hoggard High School, Wilmington NC](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/learning/what-things-remind-you-of-your-childhood.html#commentsContainer&permid=114642406) Each time I step into my garage and look upon the heap of storage to see our old Burley, I am reminded of a simpler time. The durable stroller could be attached to a bike or just pushed. I remember coming down with a cold in elementary school, then hopping into the Burley to to join my sisters on the walk to school as my mom insisted I should come never the less. The Burley reminds me of going to the library to pick out a movie. Then going back home, grabbing some blankets, and a dvd player for the ride to get comfy in the glorified stroller while my mom pushed me. We would play little word games on our walks. I could sit in that stroller and look up to watch the trees pass above me. The Burley was a vehicle to adventure. \u2014 [Celia, Glenbard West Highschool](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/learning/what-things-remind-you-of-your-childhood.html#commentsContainer&permid=114649143) Songs That Evoke Memories Another thing that transports me back in time is the song \"Somebody That I Used to Know\" by Gotye. When I was little me and my Dad would listen to it all the time, and I loved that song so much(even though I didn't quite understand what the song was about). I eventually forgot about the song, until one day a year or so ago, when I heard it on the radio, and then all of a sudden the memories came flooding back. I remembered singing it with my Dad in the kitchen, before bed, everywhere. It was just one song, but there were so many stories connected to it. \u2014 [Layla, J.R. Masterman in Philadelphia, PA](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/learning/what-things-remind-you-of-your-childhood.html#commentsContainer&permid=114642356) All of the nostalgic trinkets mentioned in the article don't really pique my interest because I was either a fetus or too young to remember them while they were on the market. If the store sold Zhu Zhu Pets or a Barbie Movie VHS, then I may have been persuaded to spend my money. Even though these miscellaneous tchotchkes remind me of my pigtail-wearing-years, nothing takes me back like the eardrum-shattering song \"Bodies\" by Drowning Pool. If you've ever listened to that song, you are probably questioning my parents' responsibility, but it is still a time-capsule of my childhood. My older brother was a sporty little boy, and before every game, he insisted on motivating himself with death metal. We all had a pregame ritual in which we would ask us to play \"the mad song,\" and we would all rock out in the kitchen. It may be too hard core for most 5 year olds, but every time I hear the artist scream the chorus, I am flooded by the warmest memories. \u2014 [Ava, Glenbard West Highschool](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/learning/what-things-remind-you-of-your-childhood.html#commentsContainer&permid=114639507) Foods That Conjure the Past The smell of spices immediately evokes images of my childhood. Living in an Indian household meant that there was always a pot of something hot bubbling on the stove, constantly being stirred. You could hear it simmering and smell the delicious scents emanating from it. Cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, ghee, all those rich and complex aromas would float out of the kitchen and into the noses of hungry onlookers. Skilled hands seasoned every dish with care, and all had their unique taste and texture. Every time I smell spices wafting in the room, I am instantly transported to the bustling, lively kitchens of my childhood. Every time I have pancakes, I am reminded of the family famous fish pancakes that my grandpa makes. My favorite food is pancakes, and when I was little, I ate them all the time. I would ask for them every breakfast and even for other meals. My grandpa is the best at making food in our family, and I love his pancakes. One morning, he was making pancakes for me, and I realized that one looked like a fish! We laughed at it, I ate it, and from then on, he has always made them for me. When thinking back to my childhood, the item that stands out the most to me would be lemon poppy seed muffins. Before I moved we used to have a Port City Java at the end of our street. My mom made it a priority to take me and my brother there everyday before school to get hot chocolate and whichever sort of treat we wanted. Even with all the options there, I would go for the lemon poppy seed muffin every time. It was my favorite food and every time I eat one now it brings back good memories from my old house and hanging with my mom. It makes every lemon poppy seed muffin I eat nowadays feel special. Those were much simpler times where I didn't have to deal with the pressure and stress I do now, so a muffin every now and then feels as if it's taking all my problems away. \u2014 [Beau, Hoggard High School in Wilmington NC](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/learning/what-things-remind-you-of-your-childhood.html#commentsContainer&permid=114643210) _________ What Story Does This Image Inspire For You? We invited students to write the opening of short stories, memoirs and poems inspired by our Picture Prompt \" [In The Waves](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/learning/in-the-waves.html).\" The image brought forth emotional writing on themes such as the meaning of home, stress relief, adventure and sisterhood. A Return to Home I lived on this beach for most of my childhood. I remember hunting for seashells that had the hues of a sunrise lying underneath the golden sand. I remember chasing after those snow white seagulls, whose cries sounded like the laughter of raucous children reveling in their freedom. I remember searching for pieces of cold, translucent sea glass that sparkled like the light of the sun on the sea. After moving to New York, I lost all of that. No more seagulls, only pigeons who squawked at me as I made my morning commute. Yet coming back after all these years, that beach still looks the same. The sand is untouched, the shells are plentiful, and the sea is inviting. It's good to be home. Release From Stress My therapist urges me to meditate frequently; she claims it will \"keep me calm through the raging storm of life\". I've never really believed in that crap before, how can sitting criss-crossed and breathing heavy fix all my problems? Still, she remains adamant in her arguments -and, seeing as my mother pays for her to help me- I might as well give it a shot. As the sound of ocean waves crashing down echos in my ears, I feel a sense of calm creeping up my spine, as though every muscle in my body is released from a tension I wasn't even aware was there. In my head, I'm no longer failing my classes, or losing my friends; in my head im lying on the beach letting the water spray over my face and laughing as I taste the salty sea spray. In my head, I am happy, everything is perfect. Now I understand. \u2014 [Rose, Glenbard West High School](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/learning/in-the-waves.html#commentsContainer&permid=114603552) Comfort of Crashing Waves The soft crashing of the waves almost immediately calmed the girls, because even though it was bitterly cold and the wind was blowing hard sand against their feet, this is where they felt most at home. This is where they could forget the drama at school, the one missing homework assignment they can't seem to bring themselves to do and the fact that all of them are dreading leaving for college in a month. They can let the ever changing problems of the real world disappear. The ocean, which was probably colder than the air, seemed like home. The water rushing over their ears, the crumbling of the waves and the bubbles on their skin. With each rush of the next wave, their shoulders dropped a little more, their heads cleared up and they seemed like they could breathe in as far as their lungs could possibly go, til they seemed like they were going to pop with content. \u2014 [Jane, Hoggard High School, Wilmington NC](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/learning/in-the-waves.html#commentsContainer&permid=114616791) Searching for Peace Run from capture to an oasis Soft sounds float through the wind Splash into an abyss of freedom Surrounded by water But no longer drowning Breathing fresher air Presence of those who understand Break from all struggle Just us and the water Soft sand caresses wounds No wants or disappointments Swept away but not lost No pain just peace Drift farther out to sea Crash into stone surroundings Pulled back Struggle and fight Return to the start No water No peace Reality repeats \u2014 [Maileigh, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/learning/in-the-waves.html#commentsContainer&permid=114568247) Adventure at Sea After being lost at sea for what seemed like weeks now, Justine and her crew had finally given up on finding land. They had ventured out to go scuba diving at the Grand New Zealand Reef, but after a terrible storm that pushed them off course and ruined the electronics on their small boat, all hope seemed lost. Their motor wouldn't spin, they were running low on both food and water, and the navigation system had stopped working weeks ago. Everyone has accepted that this was it, they would never see their families again. This all changed after Justine noticed a glimpse of what seemed to be a bird out the corner of her eye. Immediately she noticed, if there were birds nearby that must mean there's land. Land was the answer to all their problems. There they could find food, take fresh water, and regroup before setting back at finding civilization. North they went, following the bird back to wherever it was going with the use of paddles to push the boat. Eventually they saw the outline of what looked to be a small uninhabited island. Once nuzzling up against the sand the three went to lay in the sand. It was land, something they thought they'd never see again. \u2014 [Beau, Hoggard High School in Wilmington NC](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/learning/in-the-waves.html#commentsContainer&permid=114617118) Saying Goodbye \"It's time, isn't it.\" I said, not as a question but as a statement. I got no response, only a weak whimper. I scooped him up. 100 pounds of furry joy in my arms as I held him like the first day I found him. I could feel it in him, that he wanted to go back, to where we met. I will oblige. I must oblige. The drive was silent, only the mum purring of the engine and his pained panting, as if he was an addicted smoker at the end of his line. The sun was readying itself for its slumber when we reached there. It was empty, people abandoning the soft sand for their barbecues and beers. I felt the sand hot under my soles, like a million tiny suns warming my feet. Touching his head, I gently lead him to the side of a tree, not far from the water. He likes that. He laid down, that small exertion exhausting the energy he had. I sat next to him. My boy. My son. My life. The water, usually fierce, came softly, tenderly caressing his nose, as if it knew. And just like that, we sat. I stroked his fur as the moon made its odyssey across the night sky as we simply smelled the sadness of the water, tasted the bittersweet sea breeze, heard the melancholy mourning of the waves. I had found him here. In this exact spot. Maybe that's why he loved the beach. Maybe it gave him a reminder of someone that loved him. Or maybe he did it for me. Maybe he knew I loved it here. I don't know when, but his body had long grown cold. The moon was gone, leaving its starry tears across the sky. \"Goodbye.\" \u2014 [Ashton, Glenbard West High School](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/learning/in-the-waves.html#commentsContainer&permid=114583161) The Joy of Sisterhood It's 5 am, and I wake up. The beach house filled with darkness, minus the glare of the new sun peeking over the horizon, streaming into the bedroom window from the balcony. Sweet cotton candy skies seared with tangerine gold, topped with feathery clouds. I look up and that's all I can see. I hurry and wake up my sisters after I throw on my wet suit and snatch up my surfboard. I go downstairs, careful not to wake my mom, only to see her sitting on the back porch swing, the color of old oak, with her steamy hot coffee. I run off the deck, the sand seeping between my toes as I become slower from the resistance of its deepness. I hear a \"Wait up!\" from behind me, both sisters, charging like bulls toward me. I throw my board off to the side near the water and I lay on my back looking up at the most precious sky view. My sisters, in unison, lay down next to me just in time for a wave to creep up behind us unnoticed until, Woosh!, it sloshes over the crown of my head, to my shoulders, and hips, then my knees and pulling back out to sea it brushes each part of my body once more. The best feeling is having my sisters by my side on this beautiful morning. \u2014 [Hannah, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NC](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/learning/in-the-waves.html#commentsContainer&permid=114578457) Learn more about Current Events Conversation [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/learning/introduction-to-current-events-conversations.html) and find all of our posts "}
