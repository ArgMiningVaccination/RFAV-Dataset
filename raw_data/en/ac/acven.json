To understand the complexity of the immune system, we propose to apply a multi-omics approach in immunological research. This review pro vides a complete overview of available methodological approaches for the different omics data layers relevant forimmunological research, including genetics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics,metabolomics, and cellomics. Thereafter, we describe the various methods for dataanalysis as well as how to integrate different layers of omics data. Finally, we discuss thepossible applications of multi-omics stud ies and opportunities they provide for understanding the complex regulatory networks as well as immune variation in variousimmune-related diseases. Keywords: multi-omics, systems immunology, integrative analysis, immune-related diseases, immune variation INTRODUCTION Infections cause millions of deaths each year, and the current COVID-19 pandemic underlines the devastating effects of these communicable diseases. At the same time, the incidence of immune- related diseases such as atherosclerosis ( 1) and autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes mellitus (2) have been increasing. All these diseases are related to or mediated by the immune system. Thus, the immune system plays a vital role in health and disease, and it is our defense mechanism againstharmful substances, infectious diseases and cancer. Within a properly functioning immune system,immune responses should be kept in a certain range, as both hypo-activation and hyper-activationlead to disorders of the immune system. Understanding how the immune system works and what causes the immune system disorders may help us to ef ciently ght against immune- related diseases. However, getting a comprehensive understanding of the immune system is a challenging task. First of all, the immune response is mediated through a complex interactive network of manydifferent immune cells and molecules, such as cytokines, immunoglobulins, and metabolites. At thesame time, this network is highly variable depending on the exact threat of the wide variety ofpathogens and other substances it 's responding to. To make things even more complex, the immune Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 668045 1Edited by: Lam Cheung Tsoi, University of Michigan, United States Reviewed by: Genhong Yao, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, China Leandro Balzano-Nogueira, University of Florida, United States Xianyong Yin, University of Michigan, United States *Correspondence: Xiaojing Chu Tsuki1128@outlook.com Yang Li Yang.Li@helmholtz-hzi.de These authors have contributed equally to this work Specialty section: This article was submitted to Autoimmune and Autoin flammatory Disorders, a section of the journal Frontiers in Immunology Received: 15 February 2021 Accepted: 28 May 2021 X, Zhang VACM, Gupta MK and Li Y doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.668045response to a certain stimulus or infection is highly variable between individuals, leading to population heterogeneity. Thisheterogeneity is exempli ed by differences in severity of patients suffering from the same infectious disease ( 3), variability in vaccine ef cacy ( 4), and variation in responses to the same medical treatment ( 5). Many factors contribute to the immune network and the inter-individual variation of immune responses, highlighting both the promise and the challenge of multi-omics studies. Until now, omics data have been used in many immunological studies to identify the determinants of immune variation andmolecular bases of the immune process in different population groups. Properly designed omics studies should make use of a p p r o p r i a t em e a s u r e m e n t sa sw e l la sr e a s o n a b l ea n a l y t i capproaches, which depend on their speci c research question. Taking omics studies on COVID-19 as an example, a genome-wide association study revealed eight genetic regions to beassociated with critical illness in COVID-19. By integrating both genome and transcriptome data, the authors prioritized one gene, IFNAR2 , that might play a causal role in COVID-19 ( 6). Another study, focusing on transcriptome data of immune cellsfrom the lung and blood, identi ed several pro-in flammatory immune pathways related to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 ( 7). A proteomics and metabolomics study investigated thechanges in COVID-19 patient sera, and identi ed molecular changes implicating dysregulation in macrophage pathways, complement pathways ( 8). cellomics and single- cell transcriptome study also revealed dysregulation of themonocyte compartment as well as two neutrophils clustersspecic to severe COVID-19 patients ( 9). Moreover, a study integrating single-cell transcriptome, cellomics, epigenome and proteome comprehensively characterized complex dynamicchanges in immune cells. Their results disclose an elevation ofIFN-activated megakaryocytes and erythroid cells, hypomethylations around immune signaling genes, and co-expression modules associat ed with clinical outcome ( 10). Additionally, a study on fecal fungal microbiota of COVID-19patients showed enrichment of Candia albicans and a highly heterogeneous mycobiome con guration during hospitalization (11). From different angles, these studies make use of omics data to provide insights in the molecular pathology of COVID-19,which can eventually lead to improved therapeutic strategies. In this review, we present an introduction to multi-omics studies to investigate immune function and variation. The reviewis split into three parts. In the rst section, we describe in brief about the different layers of omics data relevant for immunological 1 ), and the commonly used methodological approaches to measure these different types of omics data. We also discuss important considerations and recommendations for an appropriate study design. In the second section, we discusshow to analyze and integrate multiple omics platforms, includingsystem genetic approaches to identify genetic factors, integrationamong multiple genetic pro les, as well as the integration and association with other omics d ata layers. We demonstrate how recent studies applied a multi-omics approach to the immune system researches, and we discuss the interpretation of results from different approaches and their importance inimmunological studies. In the third section, we discuss theimmunological subjects that need speci c attention and may see progress in the next few years. As for detailed information oncomputational algorithms and models in multi-omics integration ( 14,15), imputation on missing omics data ( 16), and strengths and limitations of system approaches in infectious diseases research ( 17), we refer readers to other recent reviews. FIGURE 1 | Overview of omics data.Chu et al. A Review of Multi-Omics Approaches Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 668045 2MEASUREMENTS OF OMICS DATA We can identify potential immunological mediators and study immune phenotypes with a wide range of omics comprising of various molecular and Table 1 ). A single omics data layer characterizes a speci c biological process from one aspect, for example, transcriptome, but this can only provide insights on genes at a transcriptional level. To achieve a holistic picture of the immune system, a systematic collection of multi-omics data is oftenrequired. The tissue (or source) to be measured is anotherimportant aspect to be considered. For example, the genome isusually regarded as a stable feature for each individual andcollected from an easily accessible tissue, such as blood. Onlyin some speci c contexts, somatic mutations acquired after birth have to be considered and measured in speci c tissues ( 18). However, many other types of omics, such as transcriptome,proteome and metabolome, vary between cell types and tissues.Therefore, it is important to consider the tissue in yourexperimental design and aim to get as close to the relevanttissue as possible. Given the complexity of the immune system, there is no golden standard for what to collect in multi-omics studies. Thenecessary data depends on the research question and subjects.Understanding the different layers of omics data is helpful forsetting up an appropriate study design. Therefore, in this part, weintroduce features and categories of different omics, and describeimportant considerations when generating these data. GENOME VARIATION MEASUREMENT Genotyping detects diversity in the genome. It describes smallvariations, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),insertion/deletions d eletions and ampli cations. Genetic diversity can lead to variation in individual immune function ( 19).To date, many techniques can be used for detecting genotypes, including DNA sequencing, DNA microarrays (alsoknown as genotyping chips) and PCR-based methods. Theseapproaches can be categorized based on their measurementscales (high-throughput vs. low-throughput methods) or based on whether they include unknown variants (discovery vs. screening methods). Classical sequencing-based approaches detect genetic variants in a nearly unbiased manner on thegenome (whole-genome sequencing) or within the exomeregions (whole-exome sequencing), including known or novelSNPs as well as structural mutation such as short insertions,deletions, and copy number variations. Considering the cost and effectiveness of genotyping scales and cohort sizes, most of the po pulation-based association studies choose genotyping screening methods, such as DNAmicroarrays. These methods measure thousands to millions ofknown SNPs in well-studied organisms, such as humans andmice. The targeted polymorphisms depend on the chip designs. For example, Immunochip contains 196,524 polymorphisms (718 InDels and 195,806 involvedin autoimmune and in flammatory diseases ( 20), whereas other custom genotyping chips contain loci designed for speci c research areas, such as Metabochip ( 21)o rc a r d i o v a s c u l a r disease chip ( 22). The number of variants that can be detected using genotyping chips has increased over the years, but even the high-density 5 million SNPs chip (Illumina OMNI5) covers only a small fraction of the 3.3 billion bases in the human genome. In order to improve the power in discovering genetic associations on the regions poorly covered by DNAmicroarrays, genotype imputation approaches are often used toexpand the coverage. For example, a commonly used genetic imputation server (https://imput ationserver.sph.umich.edu/ index.html#)! takes the ~60,000 covering SNPs, as a reference toimpute millions of missing SNPs based on the measuredgenotypes and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structures ( 23). Before association analysis, genotype data should pass a standard quality control (QC) at both individual level and SNP levels. Individuals with discordant sex information, outlying missing genotype or heterozygosity rate should be excluded TABLE 1 | Typical approaches in omics measurements. sequencing-based microarray-based MS-based approaches rRNA-seq, cell sequencing approaches - FCM, CyTOFChu et al. A Review of Multi-Omics Approaches Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 668045 3(24). Duplicates and relatives could be identi ed by calculating identity by descent (IBD), and a multi-dimensional scaling plotmerging with reference data such as the 1000 Genomes project(25) could help with the identi cation of individuals of divergent ancestry. SNPs failed in genotyping and/or imputation and SNPswith low frequency and/or that deviate from the Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium are commonly removed before association analysis, especially in array-based studies, becausethose signals usually relate to bad genotyping quality. However,some SNPs with low frequency may also contribute to rarediseases or phenotypes. With the increase in genotypingquality, more and more recent studies focus on the function of rare alleles (minor allele frequency [MAF] < 0.01) ( 26-29). EPIGENOME AND 3D CHROMOSOME MEASUREMENT Epigenetics describes the study of chromatin traits (either in DNA or histones) that do not involve changes in the nucleotidesequence. Epigenetics measurements are mainly characterized bythe changes and chromosome structure. DNA methylation is the process of adding methyl groups to DNA molecules, almost exclusively in CpG dinucleotides withthe cytosines on both strands being methylated. This processusually acts in promoter regions to repress gene transcription, and abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing, is often associated with immune diseases or used as abiomarker ( 30). Genome-wide 32) and other non-targeted DNA methylation pro les, provide an opportunity to discover novel biomarkers. Other techniques, such as bisul status of CpG Similar togenotyping arrays, the targeted regions from methylation arraysare based on the chip design. For the study of the humanimmune system, some well-esta blished arrays can provide comprehensive coverage. For example, MethylationEPIC BeadChip covers over 850,000 methylation sites, making it ideal for an epigenome association study within big cohorts ( 35). As the essential proteins that pack and order the DNA into structural units, histones play a role in gene regulation ( 36). occurs as arginine lysine (K), or used to identify speci c histone modi cations that bind to DNA regions or domains. Chromatin modi cations and accessibility is another important aspect of epigenet ic changes. One of the most widely-used techniques to genome-wide open chromatin within apooled sample or tissue, while in order to capture cellularheterogeneity, single-cell ATAC-seq measures chromatinaccessibility in thousands of individual cells, which can generate genome-wide pro les from 10k to 100k cells per experiment ( 38). Alternative techniques are also used to investigate chromatin phen omena, such as DNase-seq and identi es well-positioned nucleosomes, and ChIP-seq, which is used to detect binding sites of speci c transcription factors ( 39). Most epigenetic measurements also come with technical errors and biases. Biological replicates and technical replicatescan help to characterize variability between samples andsequencing runs. Putting replicates of different conditions inthe same batch is also import ant to avoid batch effects confounding treatment effects. Large projects, such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), have providedstandard pipelines for proce ssing many types of epigenetic data, such as ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq. However, this is notapplicable in all cases. Applying appropriate QC strategies andsoftware that accounts for b i a se f f e c t sa c c o r d i n gt ot h e experiment design is essential to obtain robust results. To increase the coverage of epigenetic measurements, several methods, such as ChromImpute ( 40), Melissa ( 41), Avocado (42), and SCALE ( 43), provide imputation approaches for different epigenetic markers. However, the existing imputationapproaches have several limitations ( 16), and are not as widely applied as genotype imputation methods. 3D chromosome structure describes how chromosomes are folded, packaged, and organized into functional compartments,and how different compartments are interconnected. Orthogonalligation-based approaches include DNA-FISH, which can helpwith nuclear architecture visualization, and chromosomeconformation capture (3C) techniques. One of the 3Ctechniques, Hi-C, is the most widely used approach to detect interactions between different genome regions (in gigabase- scales) ( 39,44). Single-cell adaptation of Hi-C methods are also used to investigate the interactions in individual cells ( 45). Ligation-based approaches have the limitation of detecting DNA fragments connected with multiple genomic regions. Toovercome this limitation, ortho gonal ligation-free methods including genome architecture mapping (GAM) ( 46), split pool recognition of interactions by tag extension (SPRITE) ( 47) and chromatin-interaction analysis viadroplet-based and barcode- linked ( 48) were developed. TRANSCRIPTOME MEASUREMENT The transcriptome comprises all RNA molecules, both coding and non-coding transcripts, in a single or population of cells. Traditional qPCR techniques can only quantify a limited number of genes at the same time. The most commonly used high-Chu et al. A Review of Multi-Omics Approaches Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 668045 4throughput techniques are RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and microarray, and they can detect a large number of genes.Similar to genotyping methods, a Whole-Genome Gene Expression BeadChips) are designed to t a r g e tm o s tk n o w ng e n e s .I n addition, a typical RNA-seq can detect alternative splicing andrare isoforms, which microarray-based techniques cannot. Certain coverage is required for sequencing data, which depends on the aim of the study. For instance, a bulk RNA-seqstudy for human differential expression pro ling requires 10-25 million reads per sample, while alternative splicing or allele- specic expression analysis need 50-100 million, and identifying novel transcripts requires >100 million reads per sample. However, a \"bulk\"like measurement of transcriptome cannot deal with the cell heterogeneity and can be in fluenced by cell composition changes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was designed to uncover the transcriptome diversity in heterogeneous samples, characterizing the transcriptome in cellresolution. There are several approaches ( 49) and droplet-based (10x the most commonly used ones. Usually, as few as10,000 to 50,000 reads per cell are enough to detect cell types, and500,000 reads can cover most of the genes ( 50). In order to increase exonic coverage and accuracy of gene quanti cation, polyA selection library preparation is commonly applied in scRNA-seq approaches such as 10x scRNA-seq ( 51). This will, however, miss the important immune repertoireproling, such as B-cell and T-cell receptors, which is mainly distinguished by their 5 'mRNA sequences. Thus, sequencing facilities, such as 10x genomics, provide length paired B-cell and T-cell repertoire sequencing, simultaneously, whenexamining cellular gene expression level. Combined withtranscription measurement, this information can improve ourunderstanding of clonal expansion and better characterizeimmune cell heterogeneity and functions ( 52). SLAM-seq detects the newly synthesized RNAs using a metabolic RNA labeling appro ach. Compared to the other scRNA-seq techniques, this method can track thetranscriptome dynamics ( 53). For example, scSLAM-seq was applied to characterize the onset of infection with lyticcytomegalovirus in single mouse broblasts ( 54). The transcriptome re flects the dynamic changes in biological processes, which is much more unstable. So, an appropriate sampling strategy on transcriptome data is crucial. In addition tothe quality control, normalization is usually performed within asample and between samples. When considering comparisonanalysis, it is also necessary to have biological replicates andcheck for batch effects using clustering-based approaches. Thereare many computational tools handling batch effects. Of note, integration approaches ( 55), as included in Seurat ( 56)a n d Harmony ( 57) packages, are commonly used in scRNA-seq analysis which detect the consistent cell type signals fromdifferent batches or measurements. However, when the batchdifference is confounded with other group information, it will betough to lter out the batch effects. In addition to batches, it is also important to consider oth er potential confounders in experiment design. For example, transcriptional differenceswere observed between males and females in COVID-19patients ( 58), thus a gender-balanced design in a case-control study will lead to an unbiased conclusion for COVID-19. Moreover, when considering sampling tissues for immune responses, circulating leuko cytes are often measured for systemic in flammatory responses, while in flamed tissues are measured for local in flammatory responses. In order to expand the capacity, deconvolution approaches have been applied tobulk RNA-seq data to characterize cell type compositions ( 59, 60), while expression recovery methods have been applied to single-cell RNA-seq data to reduce the dropout noise ( 61 ,62). Like imputation approaches in genome and epigenome studies,one should be aware and careful with the potential false signals inthese recovery or deconvolution approaches. PROTEOME AND METABOLOME MEASUREMENT Proteins are the major transcriptional products and functional units in the immune system. Immune molecules like immunoglobulins and cytokines are usually detected and/orquanti ed or massspectrometry (MS)-based approaches. In addition to independent measurement, proteins can be also measured together with RNA transcripts. CITE-seq provides anopportunity of identifying surface proteins along with RNA-seq.This approach is often used for cell labeling in scRNA-seq ( 63). Cells in different research groups (e.g., under differenttreatments, from different tissues) could be labeled withdifferent antibodies as hashtags, then sequenced together as one pool. This process has two advantages: decreasing cost and excluding potential batch effects. In addition, as we also knowthat some immune cell types have speci c cell markers, this approach can also be used to identify cell types. For example, thedetection of CD3e, CD4 and CD8a proteins on the cell surfacecould help to distinguish CD4 T cells from CD8 T cells ( 64). Moreover, there is a new technique called INs-seq, which can measure intracellular protein activity along with scRNA-seq.This new technique shows a large potential of applications inimmune-related studies ( 65). The study of metabolic processes that regulate immune cell responses, which is referre d to as immunometabolism, has become an exciting area in translational research, and is paving the way for novel therapies in immune-related diseases. The intermediate or end products of cellular metabolism aremetabolites, which include, but are not limited to, lipids, fattyacids, amino acids, bile acids, and cholesterols. Considering theregulatory effects of metabolites on the immune response ( 12,66, 67), the metabolome has become an important subject to study in immunological research.Chu et al. A Review of Multi-Omics Approaches Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 668045 5Approaches to study the metabolome can be classi ed into targeted and non-targeted techniques. Nuclear magneticresonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most commonlyused techniques, detecting speci c nuclei in the target molecule (68). Compared to NMR, mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches are more high-throughput and quantify metabolites in a non-targeted way, which detect mass-to- charge ratio ( 69). However, MS-based approaches have a limitation in annotating metabolites, which is the majordrawback of this method in contrast to NMR. Metabolites datacould be acquired from different sources of samples. Amongthem, circulating metabolites are the most commonly measured. There are also many studies about fecal and urine metabolites. Similar to transcriptome analysis, a proper normalization (usually a log transformation) is required in both the proteomeand metabolome data process. Secondly, biological replicates andbatch effects have to be taken into consideration as well. Inaddition to linear regression, more advanced computational tools, such as ROIMCR ( 70), can also be used to reduce the batch effects and to identify metabolites that associate withimmune responses. In terms of sampling tissues, in addition toblood cells and in flamed tissues, proteome and metabolome can also be measured in urine, which is thought to be a rich sourcebut underestimated in recent studies ( 71-73). In addition, fecal metabolites are usually studied together with microbiota, which affects immune homeostasis and susceptibility of the host to immune-mediated diseases. Of note, there is a recent studyreporting a reference map for serum metabolites ( 74), which can serve as a guide to control for irrelevant confounders inserum metabolite studies. DIGESTIVE SYSTEM MICROBIOTA MEASUREMENT Microbiota refer to all micro-organisms in a certain environment, for example the human digestive system. It hasbeen reported to vary among individuals, to in fluence host immune functionality and to be involved in immune-mediateddisease pathology ( 75-77). The commonly used approaches to study microbiota include 16s rRNA sequencing and metagenomics sequencing. After excluding host (human) reads, microbiota reads are aligned to the known microbiomegenomes to identify the taxonomies and abundance. While thereare also other omics approaches including metatranscriptomics,metaproteomics, and metabolomics, which target transcripts,proteins, or metabolites from microbiota ( 78). Of note, studies on human microbiota usually have relatively low concordance compared to other omics data studies. A recent study has reported a number of host variables that could confound human gut microbiota researches. To be exact, bodym a s si n d e x( B M I ) ,s e x ,a g e ,g e o graphical location, alcohol consumption, bowel movemen tq u a l i t y( B M Q ) ,a n dd i e t should be balanced in cases and controls when comparing gut microbiota compositions ( 79). In the context of sample collection, most of the microbiota samples are acquired fromt h es t o o l ,w h i l eu r i n ea n de x h a l e dg a sc o u l db ea n o t h e r important resource for microbiome detection ( 80,81). CELLOMICS MEASUREMENTS Cellomics measurements often reveal the systemic responses at the level of cells and tissues, typically including cell composition, cellular localization and traf cking analyses. Cell composition is measured as cell type abundance or proportion, which iscommonly quanti ed by flow and mass cytometry ( 82) and CyTOF) or single-cell sequencing techniques. With the helpof cell surface markers or cellular-speci c expression markers, both techniques can characterize hundreds of circulating cellsubpopulations covering major immune cells involved in innate and adaptive immune responses (i.e., neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and their subtypes). Additionally, high-contentscreening (HCS) is used to track traf cking and morphologic phenotypes ( 83,84). SYSTEMS ANALYSIS ON OMICS DATA After data collection and pre- processing with appropriate strategies, the next big challenge lies in linking different omicsdatasets and clinical phenotypes. For a certain trait or disease, a systems model can be built to specify the role and effect of different data layers. In this model, the qualitative or quantitativecharacteristics are linked by their relationships, which need to beestimated viacomparison, association and other systems approaches. These links can simply be a correlation, or aregulatory or causal effect. In this section, we introduce general system approaches among different omics data and provide representative examples of how they can be applied inimmunological studies. GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS AND QUANTITATIVE TRAITLOCUS MAPPING Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aim to scan the whole genome to nd genetic determinants of certain traits. When considering a binary trait (e.g., case-control), we compare allele frequency in two groups of individuals, for example one disease group and one healthy group. A chi-squared test is often appliedto test for statistical signi cance. It is usually considered that there are ~1,000,000 independent loci in the human genome, so ap-value less than the Bonferroni corrected threshold of 0.05/1,000,000 (5 \u00d7 10 -8) is regarded to be genome-wide signicant ( 85). To date, GWAS have identi risk loci of immune-related diseases in ~400 studies ( 86). Those ndings improved our understanding of genetic factors in fluencingChu et al. A Review of Multi-Omics Approaches Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 668045 6immune-mediated diseases, further pointing to the genetic basis of pathology as well as treatment targets. Generally, GWAS identify pathogenetic genetic factors contributing to phenotypes (diseases), though those variantsw i l ln o tc a u s ed i s e a s ed i r e c t l yb u ta f f e c ti n t e r m e d i a t emolecules. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis is a statistical method to discover the genetic basis of the intermediated phenotypes, su ch as gene ( 91,92). After data normalization, a linear regression between each genetic variant and each quantitative trait is applied. Covariates are crucial aspects of the regression model of QTL analysis. Based on the type of omics, different covariates should be included inthe model to correct the detected phenotypes. In general, basichost features such as age and sex are considered, and apopulation structure has to be additionally taken into account,especially in large cohorts with samples from admixed ancestry (93,94). eQTLs are the associations between SNPs and expression of genes, which provide insights of the function of genetic variants.eQTLs can explain 10% - 50% heritability of a phenotype/disease(95), which means that gene expression variation is one of the major consequences of genetic variants. It is very useful forprioritizing pathogenic gene s when there is an association between a gene expression and a pathogenic genetic variant. Based on the position, eQTLs are classi ed into cis-eQTL (eQTL within 1Mb of the gene) and trans-eQTL (eQTL located outside1Mb of the gene). Among them, trans-eQTLs are more tissue-speci c than cis-eQTLs ( 88). Of note, tissue-speci ce Q T L s provide a way for prioritizing pathogenic tissues ( 96). QTL analysis on epigenome identi es the non-coding regions ( 97), particularly, regulatory elements identi ed by ENCODE ( 98) and Roadmap projects (99). These observations highlight the importance of epigenome in the genetic regulation of diseases and immune functionality. Similar to eQTL analysis, this analysis could help us nd the potential epigenetic mechanism responsible for the associationbetween genetic variants and immune traits/diseases. Forexample, a study investigated genetic variants that affect theactivity cis-regulatory domains (aCRD-QTLs) or correlationstructure cis-regulatory domains (sCRD-QTLs) in 317 lymphoblastoid and 78 broblast cell lines, and their consequence on gene expression ( 100) .A tt h es a m et i m e , genetic variants can also affect methylation (meQTL) byinfluencing the binding of DNA methyltransferase (DNA MTase). Large meQTL studies in blood samples showedsigni cant enrichment in autoimmune diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn 's disease ( 101). pQTL mirrors the associations between genetic variants and protein level. About 40% of cis-protein quantitative trait loci(pQTLs) are also eQTLs, as expected, indicating a sequentialgenetic regulation between gene expression level and proteinlevels. By applying pQTL analysis, we could identify the potentialmechanism, at the protein expression level, behind the association from genetic variants to immune-relatedp h e n o t y p e s .S a m ea sw i t hc i s - e Q T L s ,c i s - p Q T L sa r ea l s olocated around transcription start sites (TSS). Notably, pQTLshowed a signi cant enrichment on missense, 3UTR and splice region ( 102). pQTLs could also help with prioritizing causal proteins/genes of immune traits/diseases. For example, a pQTL of serum IL18R1 and IL1RL1 also associates with atopicdermatitis. This association between genetic locus and proteinlevel indicates a possible involvement of IL18R1 and IL1RL1 inatopic dermatitis pathology ( 102). Metabolites that mediate the association between genetic variants to immune functionality and immune diseases could be discovered in an mQTL analysis. More than 140 genomic lociare associated with circulating metabolite features explaining amedian 6.9% ( 103). Overlaps between mQTLs and immune traits QTLs suggest the role of metabolic processes inthe genetic regulation of immune functionality. For instance, a mQTL study indicates that mQTL loci function, respectively ( 104). Immune phenotypes such as circulating immune cell proportion and cytokine production capacity in response tostimulations are crucial para meters when characterizing immune activities. Understanding the genetic determinants of immune phenotypes can provide insights into immune function and immune-mediated diseases. A human functional genomicsproject has identi ed >20 genetic factors determining immune cell proportions and cytokine production upon stimulations,which provided a link between genetic control and inter-individual variation ( 92,105). INTEGRATION OF MULTIPLE GENETIC ASSOCIATION PROFILES In the context of immunological research, multiple diseases, and molecular and cellular phenotypes can be regulated by the samegenetic factors, indicating an internal association between them.Integration with multiple genetic pro les can provide insights and build connections between associated phenotypes. Ideally, such genetic pro les can be directly built from GWAS and QTL analysis of different layers from the same individuals. Otherwise,they can be also collected from different population-basedcohorts. A number of computational approaches have beendeveloped to discover the link. In particular, approaches like colocalization ( 106), genetic correlation ( 107) and Mendelian randomization (MR) ( 108) take genetic variants as the instrumental variables to infer the association or causalitywhen multiple traits are associated with the same locus. Colocalization analysis evaluates the association from each of the single locus, and it helps to identify the phenotypes that sharethe same genetic regulation. Examples of colocalization analysis include a study integrating genetics, epigenetics and transcription to identify colocalization of molecular CD16+ neutrophils and T cellsChu Review of Multi-Omics Approaches Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 668045 7(109). Results from this analysis illustrate molecular mechanism at autoimmune diseases-associated variants, including analternative splicing signal around SP140 in T cells which mightbe involved in Crohn 's disease pathology. Genetic correlation considers the full summary statistics to describe to which extent the ge netic background is shared between two phenotypes. An example from a LD regression- based genetic correlation approach showed a shared genetic basisof autoimmune diseases such as Celiac disease and type 1 diabetes ( 107). This indicates a similar pathological mechanism between these two diseases. MR is a statistical method working on the step from association to causality. If one trait (exposure) is causal to another trait (outcome), then the genetic factors contributingto the exposure should also contribute to the outcome. Thiswould be re flected in the correlation between effect sizes of the same genetic variant on exposure and outcome. There aremany examples of immune-related studies that applied MR, which led to the identi cation of causal relationships between IL-6 signaling and rheumatoid arthritis ( 110), IL-18 and inflammatory bowel disease ( 111) and between eosinophilic indices and asthma ( 26). COMPARISON AND ASSOCIATION OF EPIGENOME AND 3DCHROMOSOME STRUCTURES Systems analysis of epigenetic changes can investigate their influence on and changes induced by immune functionality or variation as well as disease susceptibility and development(112,113). As an example, the impact of cytokines was studied on the epigenome of insulin releasing cells ( bcells) from type 1 diabetes pancreases. By events in human bcells ( 114). Moreover, in immune systems, the effects of epigenetic changeslead to long-term alterations in the metabolic and transcriptionalpathways, and further induce immune memory ( 115)o r immunological diseases ( 116). Thus, epigenomics is another vital area for better unders tanding of the personalized immune system. While genetics is stable, the epigenome is subject to dynamic changes, which can be induced or affected by host andenvironmental factors, such as smoking, drug usage, diet,aging, in flammation, disease, and exposure to pets. Considering that epigenetic changes affect gene transcriptionlevels, the epigenome is a pivotal part to study when trying to understand immunological networks. In a case-control study, differential accessible regions (DARs) could be identi ed in an ATAC-seq data, as well as differential positions/reg bisul te sequencing rray. Instead of comparison analysis, association analys is is applied to continuous phenotypes to get associated regions. Upon the position of acquired regions, we could further map them to thecorresponding genes. More speci cally, by checking which gene TSS regions are overlapped with the peaks/regions, thepeaks/regions could be matched to genes, and then for pathwayanalysis to get more biological meanings. For example, in amulti-omics study on mixed-phenotype acute leukemia,researchers associated scATAC-seq with transcription responses from scRNA-seq and antibody captured from CITE- seq. Despite widespread epigenetic heterogeneity of chromatinaccessibility within patients, they reported common malignantsignatures across patients, and thus revealed both distinct andshared molecular mechanisms of mixed-phenotype acuteleukemia ( 117). Another application of epigenetic analysis is to annotate the function of the identi ed regions, based on the signals from epigenetic markers. A tool ( 118) used a multivariate hidden Markov model applied to annotate regulatory elements (e.g.,Transcription promoters) with histonemarkers (e.g. H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K9me3,H3K36me3) binds to the chromosomes. Applying this method,an example learnt the chromatin states in mice and humans, and reported the up-regulation of immune regulatory regions in Alzheimer 's disease ( 119). The analyses on 3D chromosomes are generally similar. In a case-control study with Hi-C data, we could get thecompartment switches in a comparative analysis. We couldfurther predict the interactions between those segments ( 120). Referring public epigenetic databases or genome annotations, we could check the overlap between switched compartments orinteractions and known epigenetic markers or elements. Basedon this information, we could again associate the changes withother immune pro les or annotate the involved regulatory elements. For example, in a study of lineage commitment ofearly T cells with Hi-C data, authors found wide compartment re-organizations across chromosomes from a transition between T cell double-negative-2 stage to double-negative-3 stage, andlater double-negative-4 stage to double-positive stage. Theyannotated the changes with domain scores, and moreinterestingly, they found the changes in the domain scoresbetween the two transitions are positively correlated, which suggests the re-organization at the former transition is actually reinforced at the later transition ( 121). Another example includes a study on activated T cells, that identi ed activation-sensitive interactions related to autoimmune diseases captured by Hi-Cdata ( 122). To capture the changes that occur in cellular activation and differentiation, time-serie s study is another hot topic in associating epigenome and 3D chromosome structures to immune responses. For examp le, a recent study elucidates the chromosome conformational changes in B lymphocytes as they differentiate and expand from a naive, quiescent stateinto antibody secreting plasma cells ( 123). The authors reveal that the changes to 3D chromatin structure occur in two discretewindows, associated with prolonged time in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Their results also suggest chromosome recon guration is linked to a gene expression program that controlsthe differentiation process required for the generationof immunity.Chu et al. A Review of Multi-Omics Approaches Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 668045 8COMPARISON AND ASSOCIATION OF TRANSCRIPTOME AND PROTEOME As the downstream products of genetic and epigenetic regulation, transcriptome and proteome changes directly re flect the in fluence of genetic and epigenetic variants. Comparison and association studies of transcriptome and proteome have allowedresearchers to estimate functional units and validate hypothesesin immune regulation. As for a case-control study, the rst and direct analysis is identifying differentially expressed genes/proteins (DEGs/DEPs), followed by pathway analysis. If the corresponding phenotypes are continuous, then associated genes/proteins will be identi ed before pathway analysis. Examples include many transcriptome/proteome studies upon the severe infectious disease COVID-19.Transcriptome measurement ac ross samples from healthy, moderate patients and severe patients suggests an overall acute inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients, whereas transcriptional responses of high cytotoxic effector T cells areassociated with moderate patients, and deranged interferonresponses are associated with severe patients ( 124). Moreover, a urine proteome study identi ed 1986 urine proteins showing signicant level changes in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls ( 125). Different from bulk RNA-seq, the adding information in scRNA-seq: cell composition, provides more analysispotentials. In a case-control study, in addition to DEGs andenriched pathways identi cation within each cell cluster/type, cell proportion could be compared between groups while novelcell subpopulation could also be identi ed in particular cases. For example, a scRNA-seq on two COVID-19 cohorts reported identical dysfunctional neutrophil clusters in severe patients ' blood ( 9). When considering the TCR/BCR analysis, it would be interesting to explore the clonotype expansion and diversityunder different conditions ( 126,127), immune development stages ( 52), or antigen speci city ( 128). Usually, a clonal expansion means an adaptive immune response targeting certain stimulation, since a certain receptor is the mediator of specic antigen recognition. Since transcriptome/proteome data is rapidly responding to environmental changes, with the transcriptome/proteomeanalysis in a time-series study, we could associate the dynamicswith infection or stimulation to comprehensively understand the host immune responses. A nice example is demonstrated in a study of in fluenza vaccination ef ciency, where authors measured the hemagglutinatio n-inhibition (HAI) antibody titers and transcriptional responses at baseline and multipletime points post-vaccination. By comparing the pro les between day 28 and day 180, the authors describe individualcategories as temporary and persistent responders and illustrate the underneath molecular mechanism ( 129). Many approaches have been developed for time-series studies, such as regression-based method like maSigPro ( 130) and a fusion method like O2- PLS ( 131). Of note, the dynamic study can also be achieved by applying a trajectory analysis such as pseudotime analysis ( 132, 133) and RNA velocity analysis ( 134) in scRNA-seq analyses. Ina recent study on COVID-19, researchers longitudinally measured samples at several time-point after symptoms, andapplied pseudo-time trajectory inference on scRNA-seq data ofepithelial cells from the upper respiratory tract. Based on thetrajectory, they predicted a new, alternative differentiationpathway that is dependent on the interferon response and marked by interferon-stimulated genes, such as ISG15 ,IFIT1 , andCXCL10 (135). Co-expression information about gene co-regulation andinteractions. These co-expression relationships are inferred bydifferent association methods, such as a weighted gene co- expression network analysis (WGCNA) ( 136) applied on transcriptome to identify consistent expression patterns amonggenes. The identi ed associations among gene expression could be applied to predict gene co-regulatory networks, further toprioritize genes involved in the same pathways ( 137). At protein level, parts of these co-expression relationships could further be explained by protein-protein interactions, which are also collected by several protein-protein interaction databases,including the innateDB ( 138) who particularly focus on immune interactions. In application, similar to gene co-expression networks, protein-protein interaction relationshipscould help with functional/pathway enrichment analysis ( 139). In the recent single-cell experiments, the co-expression relationships are further applied to predict the cell-cell interactions. By detecting the correlation between knownligand and receptor genes among different cell sub clusters, wecould infer the potential communications between cellpopulations ( 140). This analysis ts well with immune network analysis. For example, by detecting ligand and receptor genes signals, a recent study identi ed cross-talks between CD8+ T cells and epithelial cells altered in the colon of ulcerative colitispatients compared to healthy controls ( 141). Additional methods, such as NicheNet ( 142), also take knowledge of gene regulatory networks or protein-protein interaction networksfrom public databases and literatures, then build a model tofurther predict the activated targets of the cell-cell interactions by correlating the ligands expression level with its potential downstream gene or protein level interactions. In an examplestudy of cell-cell interaction underlying the tissue-speci c imprinting of macrophages, the authors deciphered theinteraction signals driving monocyte recruitment, engraftment,and acquisition of the Kupffer cells associated transcription factors, and they identi ed the contributions of different cells to Kupffer cell niche ( 143). COMPARISON AND ASSOCIATION ON METABOLOME/MICROBIOME Metabolome or microbiome are additional factors that re flect, or affect, a person 's state of health ( 144,145). Similar to transcriptome or proteome, comparison and association analysis could be applied on metabolome and microbiomedata. However, metabolome can be hardly linked to genes,Chu et al. A Review of Multi-Omics Approaches Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 668045 9which leads to different strategies of interpretation. Taking KEGG ( 146) and HMDB ( 147) as references, an online tool MetaboAnalyst performed metabolic pathway enrichment andnetwork analysis on the identi ed metabolites ( 148). An example serum study on COVID-19 detected accumulation of 11 steroidhormones and suppression of amino acid metabolism in patients ( 8) As for the gut microbiome, a diversity analysis could be applied to taxonomy data. There are different strategiesavailable for functional pro ling on the gut microbiome data. For example, HUMAnN takes metagenomic ormetatranscriptomic sequencing data as input to identify gene families and abundances ( 149). Gene families could be further matched to broader functional categories, such as MetaCycmetabolic pathways and GO ca tegories for functional interpretation. For example, a study associated gut microbiomefeatures to cytokine production capacity, and found microbialmetabolic pathways: palmitoleic acid metabolism and tryptophan with TNFaand IFN 150). As in transcriptome and proteome time-series studies could provide valuable information in metabolome andmicrobiome data. For example, in a study of metabolic functionsof gut microbes from patients with In flammatory Bowel Diseases, fecal samples were collected at baseline and 2, 6, and 14/30 weeks after induction of therapy to collect metabolic and microbiota pro les. The observed association in dynamics of metabolites and diversity shifts of microbiota reveals theheterogeneity of the disease, and helps the authors to build asilico model that might be used to identify patients likely toachieve clinical remission from the therapy ( 151). INTEGRATION OF EPIGENOME, TRANSCRIPTOME, PROTEOME,METABOLOME, MICROBIOTAAND CELLOMICS Besides associations between omics data and genetics, a simple association analysis between two different non-genetic omicsdata could be applied to the data measured in the same cohort with a large sample size to nd the co-regulations behind (Table 2 ). For instance, eQTMs (associations between methylation and gene expre ssion) provide a resource to integrate methylation and gene expression. Highly methylationcan block the binding of transcription factors on promoters and enhancers. In line with expectation, most eQTMs showed negative correlations between methylation and geneexpression, eQTMs are enriched inactive TSS regions ( 152). For another example, a study carefully characterizes the changes in the gut microbiota of patientssuffering in flammatory bowel diseases and the interplay between microbiome composition and gut metabolites ( 153). In the situation of a more complex multi-omics integration, more advanced technique like building multivariable regressionmodel could take features from different omics to evaluate theaccumulative effects/prediction power on a certain phenotype.An example study integrates genomic, metagenomic, metabolomic, immune cell composition, hormone levels and platelet activation pro les with cytokine response pro les in a population-based cohort. Results from multivariable linearregression and machine learning approaches such as elastic netshow the accumulative contribution and predict power of geneticand non-genetic factors on cytokine response ( 154). On the other hand, if the sample size is not allowed for association analysis, it might be applicable to check the intersections between the ndings from different omics. For example, we could easily compare the regions identi ed in ATAC-seq, methylation array and Hi-C data. In addition, bymatching a DAR to genes, and intersecting with DEGs, we couldfurther check whether an epigenetic change has the potential in regulating gene expression. DISCUSSION AND PERSPECTIVES In this review, we have discussed the multi-omics application for immunological studies, from measurements and analysis tocomparison or association of several typical layers ( Figure 2 ). For system studies -in particular newly discovered infectious diseases or rare diseases with fewer prior knowledge -the choice TABLE 2 | System analysis between omics. binary traits epigenetics gene coexpression/ interaction- association association metabolites different abundance -- - association association association microbiome different composition -- - - association - cellomics Different cell composition, etc. -- - - - associationChu et al. A Review of Multi-Omics Approaches Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 668045 10of data layers to collect and the selection of measuring approaches, target or non-target technique, bulk or single-celllevel, can be as important as the analysis models and algorithms.Here, we discuss a few points that need speci c attention in study design and interpretation, and subjects may see progress in the next few years. There are some commonly used strategies of interpreting genetic associations. As the starting point of the central dogma ofmolecular biology ( Figure 2 ), genetics has so far received a lot of attention and was associated with many types of data orphenotypes. In the interpretation of genome-wide associated loci, genes around them have also been regarded as the necessary and most essential compartments. The strategy toproperly link loci with affected genes so far has been addressedon the position and associations between gene expression andgenetic variants (i.e., eQTLs). In addition, functional annotationon identi ed loci, such as whether the variants are located on the regulatory elements or affected protein structure, may provide additional clues for loci interpretation in particular cases.Nevertheless, there are existing debates upon several aspects,for example, whether the host genome could in fluence the gut microbiome. It will never be nitpicking to be very careful withinterpreting your microbiome QTLs. Epigenetic could be used as a window to study environmental influence. In contrast to genetics, epigenetics often links the external factors to immune phenotypes. This is particularly truewhen considering the external effects as a risk to immunediseases, for example, smoking to asthma, because epigeneticmodi cations, such as methylation, are usually related to environmental exposures. Considering the various kinds of epigenetic changes, multiple types of epigenetic data are commonly used in one study and they often validate andcomplement each other. For example, an active TSS regioncould be identi ed by low methylation as well as high DNA accessibility ( 155), and the enhancer involved in a neo chromatininteraction identi ed in Hi-C data could be characterized as a neo opening region in ATAC data ( 156). Considering the functional relationships, epigenetic data is commonlyintegrated with gene expression measurements. As the direct consequence of epigenetic modi cation, alteration in corresponding gene expression could be the best validation ofthe importance of your epigenetic studies. scRNA-seq is usually applied together with Cellomics measurements. A cell composition discovered in scRNA-seqdata could be validated with FCM-based approaches. FACS isalso commonly used as a pre- ltering step to help with concentrating target cell types for scRNA-seq analysis. Especially, for the rare cell types (e.g., T regs in PBMCs), apre-sorting process is necessa ry for concentrating on cells of interest. Proteome, metabolome showing downstream immune functions require more attentions. As the downstream products of gene expression, protein or metabolites level measurements are not as popular as transcriptome measurements in current studies.This might because gene expression analysis takes advantage ofthe ef ciency of next-generation sequencing and well-established microarray chips. Thus, there appears to be much room forfurther studies on proteome and metabolome in immune studies. Proper measurement techniques and sampling tissues are crucial in an omics study. When considering the purpose of measurements, it is often appropriate to apply high-throughputand/or non-target approaches at the discovery stage, while singleand/or target approaches are more commonly used for validation.Besides, except genome, all the other omics have tissue speci city. Data from the same tissue are more commonly associated. For example, associations between omics from blood samples could be easily interpreted, but it would be tricky and needs morebiological basis to associate blood features with gut features. A straight-forward joint visualization of multi-omics data is another challenge to better present and understand the FIGURE 2 | Central dogma and regulations of different omics layers.Chu et al. A Review of Multi-Omics Approaches Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 668045 11interconnections across molecular layers as well as to fully utilizing the increasingly available omics data. Integrated toolsor platforms that combined a comprehensive analysis work flow and interactive visualizations were often more preferable toresearchers. Some examples are: PaintOmics3 ( 157)a n d Metascape ( 158), which provide powerful online frameworks for the multi-omics pathway analysis and visualization; Seurat (56), which focuses on analysis and visualization of single-cell omics data and supports easy connections to other popularanalysis tools; and Omics Playground ( 159), who provides a user-friendly and interactive self-service bioinformatics platformfor analysis, visualization and interpretation of transcriptomics and proteomics data. Moreover, trials of combing data sharing and interactive visualization along with research publicationhave also been made to improve the data dissemination. Forexample, by accessing to Immgen ( 160), FastGenomics ( 161)o r DeCovid ( 58), researchers can explore and visualize their interested immune signatures on the COVID-19 datasets, which signi cantly increases impact of the studies. To fully elucidate the biological processes involved in the immune system, several aspects remain unknown in omicsstudies. Firstly, due to sample accessibility, fewer studies havebeen performed on tissues other than blood. Taking meQTLs asan example, several big studies have been carried out bloodsamples ( 101,162,163). However, there are very limited sample size and/or studies about meQTLs in other tissues ( 164). Secondly, considering the high dynamics, rapid response andspatial speci city of the immune system, temporal and spatial studies can provide more insights into the dynamic process andspatial heterogeneity in immune activities and/or immune-r e l a t e dd i s e a s e se t i o l o g y .F o re x a m p l e ,t h ep r o c e s st h a t immune cells are activated by interacting physically and chemically with synapses is highly dynamic and depends onthe spatial position of immune cells, neurons and glial cells.Despite its importance in immune functionality and immune-mediated diseases, our current knowledge is not suf ciently advanced, which calls for more comprehensive studies ( 165- 167). Thirdly, as for population-based studies, there are much more of them in healthy individuals of European ancestry, while the studies in under-represented populations as well as inpatients appeal for greater attention.Considering the complexity of our immune system and patient heterogeneity, in terms of severity or treatmentresponses, for many immune-related diseases, the generation ofpersonalized medicine is one of the most signi cant goals we can achieve through multi-omics studies ( 168). Personalized medicine strati es a heterogeneous group of patients based on certain characteristics and provides treatment based on this strati cation. In the case of infectious diseases, one of the personalized medicine trials is now being conducted for thetreatment of sepsis using immunomodulatory interventions afterstratication based on biomarkers identifying immunosuppression or hyper in flammation ( 169). In the eld of tuberculosis, advances are being made too, as a clinical trial is now ongoing where tuberculous meningitis patients are being strati ed based on genotype prior to treatment ( 170). In conclusion, we systematically review measurements and analyses can be applied in immunological studies, which provideinsights for personalized medicine. Through the development of high throughput techniques, e.g. single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry, we now possess the tools to unravel the manycomplexities of the immune system in health and immune-related diseases, including infectious diseases, allergies andauto-immune diseases. With unbiased measurements andeffective integration, multi-omics studies can help usunderstand the immune system and could lead to the development of personalized medicine.
