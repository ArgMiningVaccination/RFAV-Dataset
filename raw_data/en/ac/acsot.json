Success means that poison or disease is removed. The script does not cure any damage (including ability damage) that has been dealt by the poisons or diseases removed; it only removes the affliction itself. Overload: For every runic charge overloaded into this script, add +1 to your caster level to remove the effects. If you overload at least three charges, you can remove both poisons and diseases with one cast, instead of just one or the other. "}
