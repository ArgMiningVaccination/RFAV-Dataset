Infant RMs (n=8/ group; 2 month-old) were immunized intramuscularly at weeks 0 4 with 30 mg stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S-2P spike (S) protein (Washington strain) encoded by mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNP) or 15 mg S protein mixed with 3M-052 in stable emulsion (Protein). At 1 year, vaccinated and age-matched unvaccinated RM (n=8) were challenged intranasally (106 pfu) and intratracheally (2\u00d7106 pfu) with B.1.617.2. Lung pathology was blindly assessed on day 7. Viral RNA copies of the N gene (vRNA) were measured by qPCR in nasal and pharyngeal swabs. Severe lung pathology was observed in 7 of 8 controls compared to 1 of 8 or 0 of 8 RM in the mRNA-LNP or protein group, respectively. On days 2 and 4, vRNA copies/ml were significantly higher in pharyngeal swabs of control RM (day 2: 4.2p> Supported by "}
