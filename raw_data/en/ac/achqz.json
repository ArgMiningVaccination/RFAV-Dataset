Why You Ask? Because if these were to be considered, prescription medication would end up being minimized, and surgical intervention would be reduced considerably. Unfortunately, our Healthcare System is not based in care for health, but more accurately represented by treating symptoms which do not appear until a person has lost greater than 60 % of normal functioning. Is That Acceptable To You? If you would like to use Our Unique Approach to Health and Wellness, and are tired of the Medical Treadmill, contact our office and schedule your Consultation and Examination with Dr. Huntoon. We look forward to meeting you. Living in today's fast paced world creates many different stresses on the body. All of that accumulated stress leads to health concerns. Having the correct tools to deal with all the different ways the body manifests the effects of that stress is key to restoring health. The major tool used to assess a person's body is a form of neuro-feedback called [Manual Muscle Testing (MMT)](WhatIsManualMuscleTesting.asp). As a [Holistic Chiropractor](WhatIsAHolisticChiropractor.asp), I use this as my primary tool for interacting with you and your body. Having that understanding and the specific tools necessary to deal with each of the following aspects of a persons health picture is important. If it is not one of the components, it will be another. The ability to completely address All 7 components are important, and we at Advanced Alternative Medicine Center will not compromise when it comes to dealing with all aspects of a persons unique health picture. Which Of The 7 Pillars Will Be Necessary? Not every one will require all seven components for each health concern. And sometimes a specific problem will require all 7 Pillars to resolve that one component. Being able to establish which techniques are necessary and in what specific order for your return to overall health is important. We do this with full transparency and agreement with you. This approach is what allows your treatment plan to be tailored specific to you for your best health outcomes. Advanced Alternative Medicine Center is unique in this way.
