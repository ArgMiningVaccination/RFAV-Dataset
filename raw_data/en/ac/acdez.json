The S ilver State Scripts Board (formerly known as the Pharmacy & Therapeutics or P&T Committee) was esta blished to identify prescription drugs to be included on the PDL. A governing body of a county, school district, municipal corpor ation, political subdivision, public corporation or other local government agency of the State of Nevada that provides coverage of prescription drugs pursuant to NRS 287.010 or any issuer of a policy health insurance purchased pursuant to NRS 287.010 may use the PDL developed by DHHS as its PDL. The PDL is not a restricted for mulary. Drugs not on the PDL are still available to recipients if they meet the Standard Preferre d Drug List Excep tion criteria. The Silver State Scripts Board consists of members who are Dire ctor-appointed physicians and pharmacists. Members must be li censed to practice in the State of Nevada as either an actively practicing physician or an ac tively practicing pharmacist. Meetings are held quarterly and are open to the public. Anyone wishing to address the Silver State Scripts Board may do so. P ublic comment is limited to 5 m inutes per speaker/organization (due to time constraints). A nyone presenting documents for cons ideration must provide sufficient copies for each Board member a nd an electronic copy to the DHCF P Coordinator for official record.

Suzette Figueroa, Eli Lilly: I am here as part of an education from the Department of Health and Human Services and Director Whitley. Following a meeting that we had with him a f ew weeks ago, I would like t o share some information with you about our affordability programs for insulins. Over t he past several years, our team has had a goal of improving affordability for patients who are on our insulins. We have do ne that through several prog rams. One milestone is known today as the Diabetes Solution Ce nter and we opened that helpline about a year ago. The intent is that we want to make sure people could reach Lilly in case they had any questions about how they could better afford their medications. The helpline is putting real people in front of real people. We hav e the goal of individualizing solutions. We are helping about eight out of ten people on average since opening the help line. We are asking policy makers in the medical field to help spread the word and share this information with their p atients. Trey Delay, Group Six Partners: I'm here on behalf of the Natio nal Alliance of Mental Illness (NAMI) of Southern Nevada. Our objective is to work with the State to assure acce ss to medication to treat mental illness. Individuals, families and the public benefit from the proper treatment of se rious mental illness both in increased recovery and reduced 44 Page 4 of 24 public expense. Prior authoriza tion and formulary restrictions to medications are barriers to effective treatment of mental illness. Long acting medications improve patient outcom es, support recovery and reduce expensive admissions and other costs. The Federal Ass istance Abuse Mental Health Se rvices Administration has reported that prior authorizations and formulary rest rictions are a barrier to trea tment. We support increasing access to these medications for Medicaid recipients and is p art of the general support for the Governor's desire to increase the number of community center behavioral health clinics w hich include medical manageme nt services. 3.

T he important things to note about Jornay PM. Jornay PM is the first and only ADHD medication dosed at night. T he importance of that comes with the DELEXIS delivery system. DELEXIS delays release and absorption of methy lphenidate for about eight hours post dose which coinc ides nicely for when most wake up. Then it ramps up to get the rapeutic levels after waking. It carries a black box warning for dependence. Jouney PM was originally created because we know parents 46 Page 6 of 24 reported difficult mornings with kids with ADHD. DELEXIS is a bead with methylphenidate layers and takes 8-10 hours for the whole process. Clin ical efficacy trials reviewed demonstrating improveme nt in the morning and evening. Adverse events are in line with other methylphenidate products. Carl Jeffery: A few new products , Evekeo ODT. We have Evekeo al ready, this is an orally di sintegrating tablet. Same medication and startin g dose, similar to the other products. M ydayis is a little different. It is approved for 13 years of age and older, but it is supposed to last up to 16 hours. We h eard about Jornay PM that is dosed in the evening. I have all the available products on t he slide here w ith the new ones.

Sapandeep Khurana: W hat about Kapvay? Carl Jeffery: It is no longer r ebatable, so they are not availa ble to Medicaid. Sapandeep Khurana: The Concerta a nd the generics, we talked abo ut these before. There are some differences, the generic is preferred, but the br and is non-preferred. And Dayt rana, the only non-oral pr oduct is non-preferred. The Brand Concerta has a more reliable profile. The Daytrana has a smoother action profile. There is nothing else like it. Mark Decerbo, Chair: Are there an y other restrictions on Daytra na? Carl Jeffery: There is nothing s pecific for Daytrana, there is general criteria for the ADHD class. Mark Decerbo, Chair: We have some discussion for the different delivery. Sapandeep Khurana: I would like to make a motion to move Daytra na to preferred. Seconded. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. Sapandeep Khurana: I would make a motion to make Concerta brand name preferred along with the generic methylphenidate ER.

Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. Carl Jeffery: Optum recommends a few changes. Moving generic Ta miflu, Oseltamivir capsules and Suspension to preferred, the brand Tamiflu non-preferred and moving Xofluza to non-preferred. Mark Decerbo, Chair: We have the recommendation from Optum. We heard the Xofluza is similar to Tamiflu in efficacy, it is just the different dosing. Sapandeep Khurana: I think there i s some benefit to taking one dose verses the multiple doses. Mark Decerbo, Chair: Any other comments, I think the one dose X ofluza is worth discussing. Motion and second to accept the PDL as presented. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. Mark Decerbo, Chair: Next is Macrolides, do we have any public comment? Carl Jeffery: When we brought this up, we thought there would b e some changes. I heard there were some challenges in getting erythromycin in the pharmacies, but I have not heard that lately.

Discusses indication, s afety, clinical trials demonstrating superiority to Hu mira and methotrexate, remission rates, black box warnings, common adverse events. Covers Skyrizi indication, dosin g, clinical trials, superiority to Stelara and Humira, no black box warning. Asks for questions and asks the board to m ake the products preferred since they are shown superior. Mark Decerbo, Chair: Any other comment? Carl Jeffery: Laura gave us a good overview. I have on the slid e a brief overview of the tw o products and the studies. I am showing a graph of the diffe rent indications for the differe nt products. The preferred products are highlighted showing we do have all the indications covered. Our exemption criteria does allow a non-preferred product if it has a unique indication. Optum recomme nds the board consider this cl ass clinically and therape utically equivalent. Motion and second to accept the class as clinically and therape utically equivalent.

Mark Decerbo, Chair: We have a motion on the floor to keep Inflectra as preferred. Second. 51 Page 11 of 24 Joseph Adashek: Can you let me know why you are making that rec ommendation? Kate Ward: Inflectra and Renflexis are bio-similars for Remicad e and used for multiple indications. I feel they are equivalent and should be used in terchangeably and be able to ha ve patients go to where they can get these administered. Mark Decerbo, Chair: The board r eally has not addressed the bio -similar. Kate Ward: It is a balance of not having to infuse one over the other because the patient has Medicaid. The infusion suite may only have one of t hose products available. Mark Decerbo, Chair: Is it more of an access or interchangeability? Kate Ward: It would be both, we would be supporting the use of biosimilars that we should be promoting and the stance that they could receive either. The FDA does not recognize the m as interchangeable, but clinically they are. The infusion centers may not have both available. So, the Medicaid population may be limited depending on the infusion location. Evelyn Chu: The list does support the use of biosimilars, we do have them listed. Kate Ward: It does not call them out as biosimilars. Mark Decerbo, Chair: I guess that is the question to the board. We have a motion to move I nflectra to preferred. Voting: Ayes: 5 Nays: 2, the motion carries. Mark Decerbo, Chair: We now have the PDL as presented. Any furt her discussion?

Carl Jeffery: Optum recommends m oving the brand Diovan and Diov an HCTZ to non-preferred and no other changes to the class. 52 Page 12 of 24 Mark Decerbo, Chair: I think losartan is the most widely used. But what are the boards thought about just having a single agent as preferred. Kate Ward: I am concerned about a single agent. We could move v alsartan to preferred to give another option. Evelyn Chu: We have had some drug shortages w ith both of these. What happens if thes e are not available. Carl Jeffery: That is part of our policy, if there is a drug sh ortage, we could allow alternatives in the system if it was an extended shortage. Kate Ward: I make a motion to a dd Valsartan and valsartan HCTZ as preferred and accept the remaining list. Second Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries.

Carl Jeffery: There are a couple changes here. Vanalice is an OTC that is relatively new, so we want to include that one. What really prompted this review was t he limited availab ility of Sklice. The ma nufacturer doesn't th ink it will be 54 Page 14 of 24 available until late 2020, so the options are pretty limited. Optum recommends the board consider this class clinically and therapeutically equivalent. Motion and second to accept the class as clinically and therape utically equivalent. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion Jeffery: Optum recommends m oving Lindane and Natroba to pr eferred and because of Sklice's limited availability, moving it to non-preferred.

Kate Ward: We have Toujeo and Ba saglar, I wonder if we put one of them on the preferred lis t if that would increase the usage over Basaglar.

Don Moran, Teva Pharmaceuticals: At the March meeting, the boar d elected to make Ajovy preferred. In the monograph, there is a piece of information missing to keep in m ind before you make a decision. The monograph was updated as of July 1, there have been critical data that has been updated since then. There was a news release out of the National Health Service, they made a comment on the CGRP. Ther e is paragraph, consider the data and consider keeping Ajovy as preferred. In the paragraph it states there i s limited analysis about the CGRP class and trials examining the efficacy and patients who failed two or more prior preventi ve therapy. However, ava ilable data suggests these patients may achieve greater reductions in migraine headaches a nd frequency further research is warranted. The National Health Service today agreed. They decided to not add one CGRP to their national formulary because patient study in the phase three trials are not reflective of the popul ation in the UK. In addition, Teva, the European Medicines Association agrees with Optum's s tatement that more research is needed. For that reason, we conducted additional phase three research. That data is published in Lancet on Augu st 16, 2019. It looks at the results of a subset of patients that failed between two and four therapeutic cla sses of preventive agents and tracked over a 12-week period their response to therapy. Patients we re randomized to monthly or qu arterly Ajovy or placebo. At the end of that time frame the analysis revealed that those patients who had failed higher coursed including Botox, they had about a 35% reduction in symptoms thereby fulfilling the hypothesis that patients with recalcitrant disease did indeed respond. That was successful enough for us to secure approval for a product in Eu rope. The last thing, the monograph states that caution should always be exercised for the use of these agents due to the lack of long-term safety data. We have now published and made available 18 months of experience with about 1500 pati ents revealing there are no signals of liver toxicity, anaphylaxis, severe hypersensitivity and very low rates of drug antibody. I agree with Optum authors. Ajovy is the only agent in the class that can be administered quarterly which may fulfill the niche for patients non-adherent to treatment. Mark Decerbo, Chair: With the new information, what are the tho ughts from the Committee to bring this back at the next meeting? Should we delib erate and vote or have it brought back? Motion to keep the PDL as previ ously with two agents preferred and bring back in December. Seconded. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the comment? David Freilich, Medical Department with Amneal Pharmaceuticals: I'm he re to talk to you about Zomig nasal spray. Triptans are the gold standard f or treating migraine. Different people respond well to different triptans. It is important to maintain access to multiple options. Papers report between 50 and 90% of patients have nausea and or vomiting and about 30% have nausea. Gastri c Stasis and nausea and vomiting are key features in migraine. It is important to have non-oral routes. I would like to request Zomig and sumatriptan as preferred agents i n the nasal spray. 61 Page 21 of 24 Lee Hochner, National Account Manger with Amneal Pharmaceutical s: When the Board reviewed this class last year, I believe the recommendation was to add Zomig nasal spray to no n-preferred, but I don't see it listed there. If you want to add a nasal spray as a preferre d agent, I ask you Decerbo, Chair: Are you sugg might be an error of omission? Lee Hochner, National Account Manger with Amneal Pharmaceutical s: I believe so. Mark Decerbo, Chair: I remember having a discussion of alternat e sites of administration. Kate Ward: We did ha ve a discussion of having a nasal spray on the preferred drug list. Holly Long: We will go back and check on that. Carl Jeffery: There are two ne w products, Tosymra and Migranow Kit. Tosymyra is another sumatriptan nasal kit. The Migranow is not actually approved by the FDA, so it will not be included in further discussion. Optum recommend the board consider this class clinically and therapeutically equiva lent. Motion and second to accept as clini cally and therapeutically e quivalent. Voting: Ayes are motion carries. Carl Jeffery: Optum recommends adding Relpax and as non-preferred. Mark Decerbo, Chair: We will go back and look at the minutes, I remember talking about a nasal spray and if there is any doubt, we can bring this back for December.

Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. et Liaison with Otsuka: I'm here to provide information on Abilify Mycite to the Board.

Nothing really new or changed otherwise. Optum recommends the board consider t he class clini cally and therapeutically equivalent. Sapandeep Khurana: Where do the i njectables fall in this list? Carl Jeffery: We talked about a dding the injectable antipsychotics and the board decided not to add it as a class. That is something we can bring back if the board is interested in ad ding now. If there is no class on the PDL, it is not managed, and everything essentially goes through as preferred. Motion and second to accept as clini cally and therapeutically e quivalent. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, carries. Carl Jeffery: Optum recommends the new Abilify Mycite be added as non-preferred and the rest of the class remain the same. Motion and second to accept the PDL as presented. Voting: Ayes are unanimous. The Respiratory Therapy Mark Decerbo, Chair: Respiratory agents, long acting/maintenanc e therapy, any public comment? Wilson Liu, Medical Science Liai son, Sunovian Pharmaceuticals: Presenting a clinical ove rview of Utibron Neohaler for COPD. There is a medical need for medical treatment of COP D. About 30% of patients report nighttime symptoms three times per week. Errors in device handling can impact del ivery and overtime reduce the clinical benefit. Covers Utibron indication, device and description and instruction for use. Clinical studies discussed and benefit compared to placebo. Please consider adding U tibron Neohaler as preferred. Carl Jeffery: We just heard about one of the new agents, the other is Wixela is a branded generic for Advair Diskus. There are too many products to fit on a single slide, I have th em all listed here. Optum r ecommends the board consider these clinically and thera peutically equivalent. Motion and second to accept as clini cally and therapeutically e quivalent. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. Carl Jeffery: The biggest change is swapping the generic budeso nide nebulizer solution for the brand Pulmicort nebulizers, we will make the bude sonide generic preferred and t he brand Pulmicort non-preferred and then make the two new products, Utibron and W ixela as non-preferred. Motion and second to accept the PDL as presented. 63 Page 23 of 24 Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. xii.

The Board is r equired to review the PDL once per year. The classes listed in the agenda are classes Optum is not making any recomm ended changes to the current preferred drug list. Unless the Board has any classes they want to call out for discussion, the Board can approve to acce pt the remaining classes as one motion. Mark Decerbo, Chair: Do we have any public comment? Motion and second to accept the remaining classes on the PDL as -is. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. f. Presentation, Discussion and Possi ble Adoption of Updated Silve r State Script Board Bylaws for Possible Action Mark Decerbo, Chair: We are a new Board, so we have new bylaws. Can we get a brief ove rview of changes? Holly Long: The last page is the most important. These have be en approved by the director. We tried to make them look nicer with a table of contents. The main reason behind the change is Senate Bill 378, the changes that impact the name change from P&T to Silver State Scripts Board has been updated throughout the document. There is a change to the terms that I've taken the opportunity to update here which is separate from the Senate Bill. The terms are every two years, that is going to stay the same, we put a limit of three consecutive two-year terms, so a total of six years. Kate Ward: Does that start from the previous committee? 64 Page 24 of 24 Holly Long: It is going to start today once these are updated a nd approved since they will be approved today. Even though your appointme nt started before today, I won't take that into consideration until today's date. If you have already served two two- year terms, I wouldn't take tha t into consideration. Some langu age in green has been reorganized, anything red with a line through it has been removed, red type is new. We do have the cost discussion information included now as well. I did update some of the language related to the open meeting law, I removed public comment requirements. The last part is th e disclosure agreement that ne ed to be signed, you don't have to return them to me today, but for the future we ask that y ou have them completed at every appointment and reappointment. It is pretty basic that other boards have, especially now with our cost discussions and proprietary information shared in the meeting. I need the board to vote to approve it. Mark Decerbo, Chair: I was looking over some stuff, section 6ea ch of the members constituting a quorum shall vote. So, I guess going forward as t he chair, since I am part of the quorum I would vote. Gabriel Lither: I think the chair can certainly vote. People get caught up with what the chair can and cannot do, but there are not any rules that says the chair cannot vote. Sometimes we need the chair's vote depending on how many members show up to the meeting. Holly Long: Yes, we would need your vote depending on how many we have for a quorum. I ha ve never heard of this being a problem with other boards. Mark Decerbo, Chair: Any other co mments or questions from the B oard? Motion and second to approve the bylaws as presented. Voting: Ayes are unanimous, the motion carries. g. Report by OptumRx on New Drugs to Market, New Generic Drugs to Market, and New Line Extensions Carl Jeffery: I will be quick h ere. We talked about the oral C GRP for migraine coming, a new insomnia medication and something for schizophren ia all coming soon. Those are the highlights. h. Closing Discussion Mark Decerbo, Chair: Do we have any public comment on any topic ? Carl Jeffery: Our next meetin g will be back here, December 5 th.

Therapeutic Class Overview Calcitonin gene related pept ide (CGRP) inhibitors INTRODUCTION Migraine is a common, recurrent, i ncapacitating disorder charac terized by moderate to sev ere headaches and disabling features, including nausea, vomiting, neurologic symptoms, phot ophobia, and phonophobia. Cluster headache is less prevalent than migraine and charac terized by attacks of severe, unilateral pain with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms, which occur every other day to m ultiple times daily during a cl uster period ( International Headache Society [IHS] 2018, Starling et al 2015). The goals for treatment of migrai ne are to reverse or stop the progression of a migra ine attack. The goals for preventive treatment are to redu ce the frequency, severity and duration of a migraine ( American Headache Society [AHS] 2019, Katsarava 2012 ). The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) includes both cluster headach e and migraine as part of a group of primary headache disorders ( IHS 2018 ): Chronic migraine is defined as 15 headache days per month for > 3 months with the features of migraine headache for at least 8 mean migraine days per month (MMD). The most com mon cause of symptoms suggestive of chronic migraine is medication overuse. A ccording to the ICHD, around 5 0% of patients apparently w ith chronic migraine revert to an episodic migraine type after drug withdrawal; such patients are in a sense w rongly diagnosed with chronic migraine. In most clinical trials, migraine that is not chronic (ie, < 15 headache days per month) is considered to be episodic migraine, although the condition is not clearly define d in the ICHD. Cluster headache is defined as 5 attacks lasting 15 to 180 minutes every other day to 8 times a day with severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, and/or temporal pain. Episodic cluster headache attacks occu r for a period of 7 days to 1 year and are separated by pai n-free periods lasting at least 3 months. Common symptoms include nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, conjuncti val injection and/or lacrimati sweating (f orehead or face), miosis, ptosis, and/or a sense of res tlessness or agitation. Cluster headache is more likely to occur in men, whereas migrai nes are more likely to occur in women. Migraines have a global prevalence of 15 to 18% and are a leading cause of dis ability worldwide. Chronic mig raine is estimated to occur in 2 to 8% of patients with migraine, whereas episodic migraine occurs in more than 90% of patients. Cluster headache is rare compared to oth er primary headache disorders. It is est imated to have a prevalence of 0.1% within the general population ( Global Burden of Disease Study [GBD] 2016, Hoffman et al 2018, Lipton et al 2016, Ljubisavljevic et al 2019, Manack et al 2011 ). Treatments for migrai nes and cluster headache are divided into acute and preventive ther apies. Evidence and reputable guidelines clearly delineate appropriate therapies for episodic migraine treatment and prophylaxis; options stretch across a wide variety of therape utic classes and are usually or al therapies. For the preventi on of migraines, treatment options include oral prophylactic therapies, injectable prophylactic therapies, and neuromodulator devices. Oral prophylactic migraine therapies have modest efficacy, and certa in oral therapies may not be appropriate for individual patients due to intolerability or eventual lack of efficacy. Fo r the treatment of acute migraine, options include triptans, ergots, nonsteroidal anti-infla mmatory drugs (NSAIDs), cluster headache, subcutaneous sumatriptan, zolmi triptan nasal spray, and oxygen have the most positive evid ence for acute therapy, and suboccipital steroid injections are most effective for preventi on (American Migraine Foundation [AMF] 2017, Marmura et al 2015, Robbins et al 2016, Silber stein et al 2012, Simpson et al 2016) . The calcitonin gene-rel ated peptide (CGRP) p athway is important in pain modulation and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approv ed 4 CGRP inhibitors for prevent ion or treatment of migraine/headache disorder(s). Erenumab-aooe is a fully human mo noclonal antibody, which poten tly binds to the CGRP receptor in a competitive and reversible manner with greater se lectivity than to other human calcitonin family receptors. Fremanezumab-vfrm and galcanezumab-gnlm are 2 humanize d monoclonal antibodies that ta rget and potently bind th e CGRP ligand, in most cases both the and isoforms. Ubrogepant is the only oral 2018[b], Edvinsson Tepper et al 2017 ). Two CGRP inhibitors known as t he \"gepants,\" telcagepant and olc egepant, were previously investigated. In 2009, Merck withdrew the FD A application for telcagepant because of elevated liver enzymes and potential liver toxicity observed with chronic use, which was likely related to the chem ical structure of the compound.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. olcegepant also ceased pursuing FDA approval; however, the manu facturer did not explicitly state the rationale. It has been widely speculated that olc egepant development ceased due t o limitations associated with administration as an intravenous (IV)-only product ( Edvinsson et al 2017, Walker et al 2013 ). No substantial issues with liver toxicity have been observed in trials with the currently marketed CGRP inhibi tors. Two investigational CGRP inhibitors with near-term anticipated approvals include rimegepan t, an oral tablet and oral disintegrating tablet CGRP inhi bitor, and eptinezumab, an IV fo rmulation that could be funded under the medical benefit. Additional CGRP inhibitors early in their development include vazegepant, the first i ntranasally administered CGRP inhibitor, and , Staines 2019 ). In April 2019, Teva announced tha t it would not pursue developm ent of fremanezumab-vfrm f or an episodic cluster headache indication due to res ults from the ENFORCE trial ( Teva Pharmaceuticals press release 2019 ). Erenumab- aooe is not currently in early phase studies for the indication of cluster headache (Clinicaltrials.gov 2019 (CGRP) receptor antagonists Table 1.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Ubrogepant has been studied as a cute therapy in approximately 3 360 patients across 2 trials in patients with 2 to 8 migraines/month with moderate to severe pain intensity either w ith or without aura and in 1 o pen-label extension (OLE) trial in unpublished formats. Erenumab-aooe has been studied a s preventive therapy in approxi mately 2500 patients across 4 trials in patients with episodic or chronic migraine subt ypes and 1 OLE trial with data from interim analyses in published and unpublished formats. Fremanezumab-vfrm has been studi ed as preventive therapy in app roximately 2005 patients across 3 trials in patients with episodic or chronic migra ine subtypes, wit h data in publis hed formats. In fremanezumab-vfrm trials, the definition of a headache or migraine day for the primary endpoint required a consecutive 2 hour (epis odic) or 4 hour (chronic) duration of pain, compared to other CGRP inhibitor trials that required a duration of 30 minutes. Galcanezumab-gnlm has been studied as preventive therapy in app roximately 2886 patients across 3 trials in patients with episodic or chronic migraine subtypes and 1 long-term safe ty trial with unpublished data to 1 year.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. safety of galcanezumab-gnlm was evaluated for treatment in one 8-week study with 106 adul ts with episodic cluster headache (maximum of 8 attacks/day). The definition of the primary and secondary endpoints differed in the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine trials. Additional differences included , but were not limited to, co-mo rbid conditions, concomitant m edications, a requirement of stable doses of migraine prevent ion medication (if co-administe red) for certain duration s, and the definitions of headache, migraine headache, and migraine day. Some CGRP inhibi tor trials allowed patients to receive concomitant preventive migraine m edication during treatm ent. Also, some chr onic migraine trials allowed for the inclusion of patients with medication overuse headache. Prevention of episodic migraine Erenumab-aooe The STRIVE trial was a 6-month , double-blind (DB), placebo-cont rolled (PC), multi-center (M C), Phase 3 trial in which 955 patients with episodic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 319), erenumab-ao oe 70 mg (n = 317), or erenumab-aooe 140 mg (n = 319) once monthly. The primary endpoint was the change in mean MMD from baseline to months 4 to 6, which favored treat ment with erenumabaooe 70 mg (mean change vs placebo , 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9 to 0.9; p < 0.001) and erenumabaooe 140 m g (mean change vs placebo, 1.9; 95% CI, 2.3 to 1.4; p < 0.001). Erenumabaooe significantly increased the pro portion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMD (difference for 70 mg vs placebo, 16.7%; odds ratio [OR], 2.13; difference for 140 mg vs placebo, 23.4%; OR, 2.81). Erenumabaooe was also assoc iated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days (diffe rence for 70 mg vs placebo, 0. 9; difference for 140 mg vs placebo, 1.4) ( Goadsby et al 2017 ). The ARISE trial was a 12-week, DB, PC, MC, Phase 3 trial in whi ch 577 patients with episodic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 291) or erenumab-aooe 70 mg (n = 286 ) once monthly. The primary endpoint was the change in MMD from baseline to w eeks 9 to 12, which favored treatment with erenumabao oe 70 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.6 to 0.5; p < 0.001). Compared to pl acebo, erenumabaooe significantly increased the proportion of patients achievi ng 50% reduction in MMD (differ ence, 10.2%; OR, 1.59). Erenumabaooe was also associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acut e migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference, 0.6) ( Dodick et al 2018[a] ). The LIBERTY trial was a 12-week, D B, PC, MC, Phase 3b trial in which 246 patients with episodic migraine who failed 2 to 4 prior preventive migraine treatments were randomized to pl acebo (n = 125) or erenumab-aooe 140 mg (n = 121) once monthly. The primary endpoin t was the proportion of patien ts with 50% reduction in MMD from baseline to the last 4 weeks of DB treatment (weeks 9 to 12), which erenumabaooe si gnificantly increased over p lacebo (difference, 16.6%; OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.43 to 5.19; p = 0.002). Compared to placebo, 5 .9% more patients treated with erenumaba ooe 140 mg reported a 100% reduction in MMD, or migraine cessation. Ere numab-aooe 140 mg/month compared with placebo significantly reduced the MMD (d ifference, 95% CI, 2.70 to 0.52; p = 0.004). Erenumabaooe was also associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acut e migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference, 1.73) ( Reuter et al 2018 ). Fremanezumab-vfrm was a 12-week , DB, PC, MC, Phase 3 trial in which 875 patients with episodic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 294) , fremanezumab-vfrm 225 mg once monthly (n = 290), or fremanezumab-vfrm 675 mg once quarterly (n = 291). The primary endpoint was the change i n mean MMD, which favored treatment with fremanezumab-vfrm 225 mg (mean c hange vs placebo, 1.5; 95% CI, 2.0 to 0.9; p < 0.001) and fremanezumab-vfrm 675 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.3; 95% CI, 1. 8 to 0.7; p < 0.001). Of note, HALO-EM w as powered to detect a 1.6-day difference in the MMD bet ween the fremanezumab-vfrm and placebo groups, but effec t sizes resulted in a 1.5- day reduction for the fremanezum ab-vfrm monthly dosing group and a 1.3-day reduction for the fremanezumab-vfrm quarterly dosing group. Although the threshold was not reached, a minimal clinically important difference has not been established for this particular outcome. Compared to placebo, greater MMD reductions were also observed in patients who were prescribed fremanezum ab-vfrm 225 mg (mean change vs pl acebo, 1.3) and 675 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.1) as monotherapy. Fre manezumab-vfrm significantly increased the proportion o f patients achieving 50% reduction in MMD (difference fo r 225 mg vs plac ebo, 19.8%; OR, 2.36; difference for 675 mg vs placebo, 16.5%; OR, 2.06). Additionally, fremanezumab-vfrm was as sociated with a si gnificant decrease in the mean monthly acute migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference for 225 mg vs placebo, 1.4; differe nce for 675 mg vs placebo, 1.3) (Dodick et al 2018[b] ). 69 Data as of December 30, 2019 LMR/AKS Page 4 of 15 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

FOCUS was a DB, PC, Phase 3b tr ial that evaluated 838 patients with episodic (39%) or chr onic migraine (61%) who had previously not responded to 2 to 4 classes of migraine prev entive medications. Of the patients enrolled, approximately 40% were classified as having episodic migraines and randomized to fremanezumab-vfrm 225 mg administered monthly with no loading dose (n = 110/283), freman ezumab-vfrm 675 mg admin istered quarterly (n = 107/276), or placebo (n = 112/279) for 12 weeks. Failure was defined as no clinically meaningful improvement after at least 3 months of therapy at a st able dose, as per the treating physician's judgment, discont inuation because of adverse events that made treatment intolerable, or treatment contraindi cated or unsuitable for t he preventive treatment of migraine for the patient. At basel ine, the MMD as approximately 14.2 days and the MMHD (of at least moderate severity) was 12.6 day s. For the overall population, the MMD re duction over 12 week s was 0.6 (standard error [SE], 0.3) days for placebo, 4.1 (SE, 0.34) days for the monthly fremanezumab-vfrm group (least squar es mean difference [LSMD] vs placebo, -3.5; 95% CI, -4.2 to -2.8 days ; p < 0.0001), and 3 .7 (SE, 0.3) for days for the quarterly fremanezumab-vfrm group (LSMD vs placebo, -3.1; 95% CI, -3.8 days; p < 0. 0001). For episodic migraine and compared to placebo, the LSMD in MMD reduction over 12 weeks was 3.1 days for both d ose groups (fremanezumab-vfrm monthly: days; p < 0.0001 for both). In the overall po pulation, the proporti ons of patients w ith a 50% response over 12 weeks were 34% in both the quarterly and monthly fremanezumab-vfrm groups vs 9% with place bo (p < 0.0001). Only the monthly fremanezumab- vfrm arm achieved a 75% susta ined responder rate sta tistically different p lacebo (OR, 8.6; 95% CI, 2.0 to 37.9; p = 0.0045). Adverse ev ents were similar for placebo a nd fremanezumab-vfrm. Serious adverse events were reported in 4 (1%) of 277 patients with placebo, 4 (1%) of 285 with monthly fremanezumab-vfrm, and 2 (< 1%) of 276 with quarterly fremanezumab-vfrm ( Ferrari et al 2019). Galcanezumab-gnlm The trials w ere 6-month, DB, PC, MC, Phase 3 trials in 858 and 915 patients with episodic migraine, respectively. Patients were randomized to placebo (EV 433; EVOLVE-2, 461), galcanezumab- 120 mg once monthly (EVOLVE- 1, n = 213; EVO LVE-2, n = 231) , or galcanezumab-gnlm 240 mg once monthly (EVOLVE-1, n = 212; EVOLVE-2, n = 223). Patients in the galcane zumab-gnlm 120 mg group received a loading dose of 240 mg at the first injection only. The EVOLVE-1 trial inclu ded a North American population and the EVOLVE-2 trial included a global population. T he primary endpoint was the chan ge in mean monthly migrai ne headache days (MMHD) (Stauffer et al 2018, Skljarevski et al 2018 ). In EVOLVE-1, the primary endpoint outcome favored treatment wit h galcanezumab-gnlm 120 mg (mean change vs placebo, 1.9; 95% CI, 2.5 to 1.4; p < 0.001) and galcanezuma b-gnlm 240 mg (mean chan ge vs placebo, 1.8; 95% CI, 2.3 to 1.2; p < 0.001) . Galcanezumab-gnlm significant ly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMHD (differenc e for 120 mg vs placebo, 23.7%; OR, 2.64; difference fo r 240 mg vs placebo, 22.3%; OR, 2.50). Compared to placebo, 9.4% more patients treat ed with galcanezumab-gnlm 120 mg and 9.4% more treated with galcanezumab-gnlm 240 mg reported a 100% redu ction in MMHD, or migraine cessation. Galcanezumab-gnlm was also associated with a significant decrea se in the mean monthly ac ute migrainespecific medication treatment days (diffe rence for 120 mg vs placebo, 1 .8; difference for 240 mg vs placebo, 1.6) ( Stauffer et al 2018 ). In EVOLVE-2, the primary endpoint outcome favored treatment wit h galcanezumab-gnlm 120 mg (mean change vs placebo, 2.0; 95% CI, 2.6 to 1.5; p < 0.001) and galcanezuma b-gnlm 240 mg (mean chan ge vs placebo, 1.9; 95% CI, 2.4 to 1.4; p < 0.001) . Galcanezumab-gnlm significant ly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMHD (differenc e for 120 mg vs placebo, 23.0%; OR, 2.54; difference fo r 240 mg vs placebo, 21.0%; OR, 2.34). Compared to placebo, 5.8% more patients treat ed with galcanezumab-gnlm 120 mg and 8.1% more treated with galcanezumab-gnlm 240 mg reported migraine ce ssation. Galcanezumab-gnlm was also associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acut e migrainespecific medication treatment days (difference for 120 mg vs placebo, 1.8; difference for 240 mg vs placebo, 1.7) ( Skljarevski et al 2018 ). In an analysis of persistence for patients with episodic migrai ne, 41.5 and 41.1% of galca nezumab-gnlm-treated patients (120mg and 24 0mg, respectively) had a 50% response for 3 months, which was greater than placebo (21.4%; p<0.001). Approximately 6% of galcanezumab-gnlm-treat ed patients maintained 75% response all 6 months vs 2% of placebo-treated patients. Few galcanezumab-gnlm -treated patients maintained 100% response for all 6 months (< 1.5%) ( F\u00f6rderreuther et al 2018 ).

Erenumab-aooe was studied in a 12week, DB, PC, MC, Phase 2 tri al in which 667 patients with chronic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 286), erenumabaooe 70 mg (n = 191), or erenumabaooe 140 mg (n = 190) once monthly. The primary endpoint was the change in MMD from baseline to wee ks 9 to 12, which favo red treatment with erenumabaooe 70 mg and erenumabaooe 140 mg (mean change for b oth doses vs placebo, 2.5; 95% CI, 3.5 to 1.4; p < 0.0001). Erenumabaooe si gnificantly increased the proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMD (difference for 70 mg vs place bo, 17%; OR, 2.2; difference for 140 mg vs placebo, 18%; OR, 2.3). Both erenumabaooe 70 mg (difference, 1.9) and ere numabaooe 140 mg (difference, 2.6) significantly r educed the mean acute migrainespecific medication day s; however, the higher 140 mg d ose had a greater reduction numerically over placebo and reductions may be dosedependent (Tepper et al 2017 ). An analysis of patient reported outcomes found patients with ch ronic migraine had clinica lly relevant improvements across a range of measures. Improvements were observed at month 3 for all endpoints regardless of erenumabaooe dose, and minimally important clin ical differences were achieved for certain measures w ith the erenumabaooe 140 mg dose ( Lipton et al 2019[b]). Fremanezumab-vfrm Fremanezumab-vfrm was studied in a 12-week, DB, Phase 3 trial, HALO-CM, in whic h 1130 patients with chronic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 375), fremanez umab-vfrm 225 mg once monthly (n = 379), or fremanezumab-vfrm 675 mg once qua rterly (n = 376). Patients in the fremanezumab-vfrm 225 mg group received a loading dose of 675 mg at the first injection only. The primary endpoint was the change in mean headache days (MHD), which favored treatment with fremanezumab-vfrm 225 mg (mean cha nge vs placebo, 2.1; SE, \u00b1 0.3; p < 0.001) and fremanezumab-vfrm 675 mg (mean c hange vs placebo, 1.8; SE, \u00b1 0 .3; p < 0.001). Fremanezumab-vfrm significantly increased the proportion of pat ients achieving 50% reduction in MHD (difference for 225 mg vs placebo, 22.7%; OR, 2.73; difference for 675 mg vs placebo, 19.5%; OR, 3.13). Addit ionally, fremanezumab-vfrm w as associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute mi grainespecifi c medication treatment days (difference for 225 mg vs placebo, 2.3; difference fo r 675 mg vs placebo, 1.8) ( Silberstein et al 2017 ). FOCUS was previously described as including 838 patients overall who had not responded to 2 to 4 classes of migraine preventive medications. Of the pat ients enrolled, 61% were diagnosed with chronic migraine and were randomized to fremanezumab-vfrm 675 mg adminis tered quarterly (n = 169/276), a fremanezumab-vfrm 675 mg loading dose followed by 225 mg administered monthly (n = 173/283), or placebo (n = 167/279). Among patients cla ssified as having chronic migraine and compared to placebo, t he LSMD in MMD reduction ove r 12 weeks was 3.8 days for the fremanezumab- vfrm monthly group and 3.2 days fo r erly (Ferrari et al ). Galcanezumab-gnlm Galcanezumab-gnlm was evaluated in a 12-week, DB, PC, MC, Phase 3 trial, REGAIN, in which 1113 patients with chronic migraine were randomized to placebo (n = 558), galcanez umab-gnlm 120 mg once m onthly (n = 278), or galcanezumab-gnlm 240 mg once mont hly (n = 277). Patients in th e galcanezumab-gnlm 120 mg group received a loading dose of 240 mg at the first injection only. The primary endpoint was the change in MMHD, which favored treatment with galcanezumab-gnlm 120 mg (mean change vs placebo , 2.1; 95% CI, 2.9 to 1.3; p < 0.001) and galcanezumab-gnlm 240 mg (mean cha nge vs placebo, 1.9; 95% CI, 2.7 to 1.1; p < 0. 001). Galcanezumab-gnlm significantly increased the prop ortion of patients achieving 50% reduction in MMHD (diffe rence for 120 mg vs placebo, 12.2%; OR, 2.10; difference fo r 240 mg vs placebo, 12.1%; OR, 2 .10). Compared to place bo, 0.2% more patients treated with galcanezumab-gnlm 1 20 mg and 0.8% more treated wit h galcanezumab-gnlm 240 mg reported migraine cessation; this was not statistic ally different for either dose group. Galcanezumab-gnlm was also associated with a significant decrease in the mean monthly acute mi grainespecifi c medication treatment days (difference for 120 mg vs placebo, 2.5; difference fo r 240 mg vs placebo, 2.1) ( Detke et al 2018 ). In an analysis of persistence for patients with chronic migrain e, 29% of galcanezumab-gnlm-treated patients maintained 30% response all 3 months compared to 16% of place bo-treated patients. A to tal of 16.8 and 14.6% of galcanezumab-gnlm-treated patients (120mg and 240mg, respe ctively) had a 50% response for 3 months, which was greater than placebo (6 .3%; p<0.001). Few patients maintained 75% response (< 3%) ( F\u00f6rderreuther et al 2018 ).

Galcanezumab-gnlm Galcanezumab-gnlm was evaluated in an 8-week, DB trial, in whic h 106 patients with episodic cluster headache were randomized to placebo (n = 57) o r galcanezumab-gnlm 300 mg once monthly (n = 49). A tota l of 90 (85%) patients completed the DB phase. Patients were allowed to u se certain specified acute/abortive clu ster headache treatments, including triptans, oxygen, acetaminophen (APAP), and NSAIDs du ring the study. At baseline, patients had a mean of 17.5 headache attacks/week, maxim um of 8 attacks/day, minimum o f 1 attack every other day, and at least 4 attacks during the prospectiv e 7-day baseline period. For the primary e ndpoint, galcanezumab-gnlm significantly decreased the mean change from baseline in wee kly cluster headache attack fre quency during weeks 1 to 3 vs placebo (-8.7 vs -5.2 attacks; p = 0.036). Galcanezuma b-gnlm was also associated with a significantly greater p roportion of responders ( 50% reduction in weekly cluster headache attack frequency) at week 3 (71.4 vs 52.6%; p = 0.046). Adverse events did not differ between groups, excep t for a significant increase in the incidence of injection-s ite pain with galcanezumab- gnlm treated patients (8 vs p = Clinicaltrials.gov [NCT02397473] 2019, Emgality prescribing information 2019, Goadsby et al 2019 ). Treatment of acute migraine (with or without aura) Ubrogepant Ubrogepant was evaluated in 2 P hase 3, PC, DB tr ials (ACHIEVE I and II), in which 3358 pa tients (ACHIEVE I, n = 1672; ACHIEVE II, n =1686) were randomized to take 1 dose of placebo (n = 1122), ubrogepant 50 mg (n = 1118), or ubrogepant 100 mg (n = 557) (100 mg was evaluated in the ACHIEV E I trial only, and a 25 mg group was included in the ACHIEVE II trial only [n = 561]). Patients had 2 to 8 migra ines/month with moderate to s evere pain intensity in the past 3 months either with or without aura and had a history of migraine for 1 year. A sec ond dose of study treatment (placebo or ubrogepant), or the patient's usual acute treatment for migraine, was allowed between 2 to 48 hours after the initial treatment for a non-re sponding or recurrent migrain e headache. At baseline, 23% of patients were taking preventive medications for migr aine, and approximately 23 to 27 % were insufficient tript an responders. In ACHIEVE I, 79% were included in the efficacy analysis and 86% in the safety analysis, and in ACHIEVE II, 91.7% had a qualifying migraine event and 88% were included in the analysis ( Dodick et al 2019, Lipton et al 2019[a], Ubrelvy prescribing information 2019 ). Compared to placebo, significant improvements were demonstrated for the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom and the most bothersome symptom (MBS) freedom at 2 hours post-dose in the ubrogepant arms. MBS was a collection of selective, self-identified symptoms (ie, photophobia, phonophob ia, or nausea). The following differences from placebo were demonstrated: Pain-free at 2 hours : 7.4% (p = 0.002) and 7.5% (p = 0.007) for the ubrogepant 50 mg dose in ACHIEVE I and II trials, respectively, and 9.4% ( p < 0.001) for ubrogepant 100 mg dose in ACHIEVE I trial. MBS-free at 2 hours : 10.8% and 11.5% (p < 0.001 for both) for the ubrogepant 50 mg dose in ACHIEVE I and II trials, respectively, and 9.9% ( p < 0.001) for ubrogepant 100 mg dose in ACHIEVE I trial. The incidence of photo- and phonop hobia was reduced following administration. Significantly more patients maintained pain freedom for 2 to 24 hours post dose in the ubro gepant 100 mg arm (differenc e from placebo, 6.8%; p = 0.002) and the 50 mg a rm for ACHIEVE II only (6.2%; p = 0.005 ). In ACHIEVE I, the most common adv erse events in cluded nausea (1 .5 to 4.7%), somnolence (0.6 to 2.5%), and dry mouth (0.6 to 2.1%). In ACHIEVE II, the most common adverse eve nts within 48 hours were nausea ( 2.5% for all arms) and dizziness ( 2.1% for all arms). No serious adverse e vents or adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported 48 hours after the initial dose. In ACHIEVE II, t he serious adverse events at 30 days included appendicitis, spontaneous abortion , pericardial effusion, and s eizure. Open-label extensions (OLE) and long-term safety studies One published OLE with data to 1 year and 1 unpublished abstract with data to 3 years ev aluated erenumab-aooe 70 mg (protocol amended to include 14 0 mg doses) in patients with episodic migraine. Of 472 patients in the parent study, 308 patients complet ed 1 year of open-label (OL) treatment. For the 3 year assessment, of t he 383 patients enrolled in the OLE, 250 continued into the 140 mg once monthly dosing. At the time of interim analysis , 236 patients remained in the OLE ( Amgen [data on file] 2018, Ashina et al 2017, Ashina et al 2018 ). There may be greater improvement s with sustained therapy based on a 1-year OLE interim analysis of episodic migraine patients treated with e renumab-aooe 70 mg once monthly . Patients had a mean va lue of 8.8 MMDs at parent study baseline. After 3 months of treatment in the parent study, the number of MMDs was reduced to 6.3 days 72 Data as of December 30, 2019 LMR/AKS Page 7 of 15 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

After a total of 16 months of treatm ent, the number of MMDs wa s reduced to 3.7 days (mean change of 5.1 days). After 64 weeks, 65% (n = 184) of episodic migraine patients achieved a 50% reduction in MMDs and 26% (n = 73) had achieved a migraine-free status. T he most frequently reported adverse events ( 4.0 per 100 patient-years) were vira l upper respiratory tract infec tion, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, influenza, and back pain. One unpublished OLE eval uated erenumab-aooe 70 mg (protocol ame nded to include 140 mg doses) with data to 1 year in patients with chronic migraine. A total of 609 patients with chronic migraine enrolled in the OLE. A total of 199 increased their dose from 7 0 mg to 140 mg by week 28 ( Amgen [data on file] 2018, Tepper et al 2018 ). Patients with chronic migraine had a mean value of 18.8 MMDs at parent study baseline. A fter a total of 1 year of treatment, the number of MMDs was reduced to 8.5 in the erenuma b-aooe 70 mg group and 10.5 in the erenumab- aooe 140 mg group. After 1 year o f erenumab-aooe 70 mg and 140 mg monthly dosing, a total of 53% and 67% of chronic migraine patients achieved a 50% reduction in MMDs and 6% and 13% had achieved a migraine-free status, respectively. The most frequently r eported adverse even ts ( 2.0 per 100 patient -years) were viral upper respiratory tract infection, uppe r respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, and arthralgia. Another unpublished safety study, the CGAJ study, evaluated gal canezumab-gnlm 120 mg (plus 240 mg loading dose) and 240 mg monthly dosing to 1 year in patients with episodic o r chronic migraine. At baseli ne, 80.7% of patients in the galcanezumab-gnlm 120 mg arm and 77.0% in the galcanezumab-gnlm 240 mg arm had episodic migraine. A total of 270 patients who had a history of 4 MMHDs and 1 headache-fr ee day/month for the past 3 months continued galcanezumab-gnlm treatment ( Eli Lilly and Company [data on file] 2018, Emgality [dossier ] 2018, Stauffer et al 2017 ). At baseline, patients had a mean value of 9.7 to 11.4 (standard deviation [SD], 6.0 to 6.6) MMHDs. After a total of 1 year of treatment, the number of M MHDs was reduced to 5.6 days in the galcanezumab-gnl m 120 mg group and 6.5 days in the galcanezumab-gnlm 2 40 mg group. After 12 consecut ive months of treatment, 24. 2% of patients treated with galcanezumab-gnlm 120 mg and 34.8% of patients treated wit h galcanezumab-gnlm 240 mg maintained response. The most frequently repor ted adverse events (incidenc e 15.0%) were injection site pain, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infections. One patient discontinue d due to suicidal ideation in the galcanezumab-gnlm 120mg group. There were no overa ll concerns regarding safety o r tolerability. The long-term safety of ubrogepa nt was evaluated in 813 patient s with intermittent dosing ad ministered for up to 1 year in an OLE. Of the 813 patients, 421 patients were exposed to ub rogepant 50 mg or 100 mg for 6 months, and 364 patients were exposed for 1 year. All patients were treated for 2 migraine attacks/mont h, on average. In the OLE, 2.5% of patients withdrew from u brogepant treatment because of an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation in the OLE was nausea ( Clinicaltrials.gov [NCT02873221] 2019, Ubrelvy prescribing information 2019 ). Caution should be exercised in applying results from extension trials. The OL design may contribute to biased reports. Extension trials may have biased outcomes because those experie ncing benefit are included in extension trials; results are useful for reporting trend s in treatment. Additionally, the re is no comparator to acc ount for placebo effects. CLINICAL GUIDELINES Acute treatment of migraine The American Headache Society (AHS) published updated consensus statement guidelines for migraine in 2018. The AHS recommends the use of APAP, NSAIDs, non-opioid analgesics, or caffeinated analgesic combinations for mild or moderate attacks. The triptans o r dihydroergotamine (DHE) are r ecommended for moderate or severe attacks as well as for mild attacks that respond poo rly to other analgesics. These guidelines do not differ entiate the triptans, but recommend that non-oral routes be used when severe nausea or vo miting is present. Overa ll, the AHS designated the following drugs as having efficacy ( AHS 2019): use is not recommended) Combination medications Probably effective Ergotamine or other forms of DHE NSAIDs (ketoprofen, ketorolac i ntramuscular or IV, flurbiprofen ) 73 Data as of December 30, 2019 LMR/AKS Page 8 of 15 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The AHS recommend it may have a role in patients with cardiovas cular (CV) conditions or in ca ses of triptan contraindications. Further recommendations include patients who have contraindications to the use of triptans or who have failed to respond to or tolerate 2 oral triptans, as determined by either a valida ted acute treatment pat ient reported outcome questionnaire or healthcare provider attestation. Coverage should be provided until 2 attacks are treated to determine efficacy and tolerability. Other agents have had more establis hed efficacy and safety relative to the newly FDA-approved migraine agents. There are a number of older gui delines/treatment recommendations for the treatment of mig raine but, similar to the 2018 guidelines, they do not state a preference for a particular tri ptan or therapy ( Evers et al 2009, Francis et al 2010, Marmura et al 2015, Silberstei n 2000, Silberstein et al 2012 [guideline reaffirmed in 2015] ). In 2019, the American Academy of N eurology (AAN) and the AHS pu blished a guideline on the acute treatment of migraine in children and adoles cents. The guideline states that there is evidence to suppo rt the efficacy of ibuprofen, APAP (in children and ad olescents), and trip tans (mainly in adolescents) for migraine relief, although confidence in the evidence varies between agents ( Oskoui et al 2019[a] ). Of note, the CGRP inhibitors h ave not been adequately studied in children or adolescents and are not currently FDA- approved for use in these populations. Prevention of migraine According to the AAN/AHS eviden cebased guideline update on the pharmacologic treatmen t for episodic migraine prevention in adults, the following medications are effective preventive treatment options (see Appendix A for a definition of classifications) ( Silberstein et al 2012): Level A (established effica cy and > 2 Class I trials): Antiepileptic drugs: shortterm prophylaxis, frovatriptan Level B (probably effective and 1 Class I or 2 Class II trials) : Antidepressants: amitriptyline and venlafaxine naratriptan and zolmitriptan Level C (possibly effective II trial): Angiotensinconverting enzyme recommends onabotulinumto xin A as an effective treatmen t option that should be offered for chronic migraine. However, onabotulinumtoxin A is considered ineffective for the treatment of episodic migr aines and should not be offered. There is insufficient e vidence to compare the effectiveness of botulinum neurotox in A with that of oral prophylactic topiramate ( Simpson et al 2016 ). In 2019, the AAN/AHS published a guideline on the preventive tr eatment of migraine in pediatric patients. The guideline states that the majority of prev entive medications for pediatri c migraine fail to demonstrate superiority to placebo. The guidelines make the following st atements and recommendations fo r initial therapy (see Appe ndix B for a definition of classifications) ( Oskoui et al 2019[b] ): It is possible that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) alone is effective in migraine prevention. There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effects of fluna rizine, nimodipine, valproate, and onabotulinumtoxinA for use in migraine prevention in children and adolescents. Acknowledging the limitations of c urrently available evidence, use of short-term treatmen t trials (a minimum of 2 months) may be warranted in those who could benefit from preven tive treatment (Level B). 74 Data as of December 30, 2019 LMR/AKS Page 9 of 15 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Consider amitriptyline combined with cognitive behavioral thera py (CBT) (inform of the pot ential adverse events, including risk of suicide) (Level B). Consider topiramate (Level B). In form of side effects including decreased efficacy when combined with oral contraceptives and the teratogeni c effect in patients of childb earing potential (Level A). In patients of childbearing potential, daily folic acid is recommended (Level A). Consider propranolol (Level B). Of note, the CGRP inhibitors h ave not been adequately studied in children or adolescents and are not currently FDA-approved for use in these populations. Cluster headache According to the AHS evidence-b ased guidelines fo r the treatmen t of cluster headache, there are a number of effective treatment options (AAN classifications were used for grading; s ee Appendix A for definitions) ( Robbins et al 2016). For acute therapy of c luster headache, the following therapy op tions have positive evidence: Level A (established effica cy and 2 Class I trials): Certain triptans: sumatriptan su bcutaneous and zolmitriptan nas al spray Oxygen Level B (probably effective and 1 Class I or 2 Class II trials) : Certain triptans: sumatriptan nasal spray and zolmitriptan oral Sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation Level C (possibly effective and 1 Class II trial): Cocaine/lidocaine nasal spray Octreotide subcutaneous For preventive therapy of clust er headache, the following thera py options have positive evidence: Level A (established effica cy and 2 Class I trials): Suboccipital steroid injection Level B (probably effective and 1 Class I or 2 Class II trials) : Civamide nasal spray (not marketed in the US) Level C (possibly effective and 1 Class II trial): Lithium Verapamil Warfarin Melatonin SAFETY SUMMARY Ubrogepant is contraindicated fremanez umabvfrm, and galcane zumabgnlm are con traindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity to the active i ngredient or any of the excipients. Mild to moderate hypersensit ivity reactions (eg, rash, dyspnea, pruritus, urticaria) were reported in trials. Cases of anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported post- marketing. In cases of serious o r severe reactions, treatment s hould be discontinued. Erenumab-aooe has an additional w arning and precaution associat ed with constipation with s erious complications noted post-marketing. Some cases have required hospitalization, including surgery. Constipation was a common adverse event reported in up to 3% of patients. Concurrent use of medic ation associat ed with decreased gast rointestinal motility may increase the risk for severe constipation. For the prevention of migraine, erenumab-aooe, fr emanezumabvfr m, and galcanezumabgnlm generally have a similar incidence of adverse events as p lacebo. Very few severe adverse events and treatment discontinuations due to adverse events were reported. The most common adverse reactions observed in CGRP inhibitor prevention studies included injection site reactions (all agents) and constipation (erenuma b-aooe only). For the treatment of episodic cl uster headache, galcanezumabgn lm was evaluated for 2 months in trials and the safety profile was similar to those adver se events observed in migrain e prevention trials. Two p atients discontinued DB treatment due to adverse events. For the treatment of a cute migraines, the safety of ubrogepant was evaluated for up to 1 year in an OLE in patients who had 2 attacks/month. The most c ommon adverse events were naus ea (2 to 4%) and somnolence (2 to 3%). The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation in the OLE was nausea. 75 Data as of December 30, 2019 LMR/AKS Page 10 of 15 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

CGRP is a vasodilator and is found at higher concentrations dur ing a migraine attack. In the 1-year interim analysis of an OLE study with erenumab-aooe, 2 patients had severe adverse events (an arteriosclerosis event and a myocardial ischemia event), of which 1 w as fatal and 1 was confounded by s umatriptan administration. N o additional concerns were raised within the OLE at 3 y ears, including any CV events. In a long-term safety study o f patients treated with galcanezumab-gnlm for 1 year, 1 patient discontinued due to sui cidal ideation in the galc anezumab-gnlm 120mg group. A total of 9 patients reported se rious adverse events with ubro gepant 50 mg (sinus tachycardia, intestinal obstruction, gait disturbance, cholelithiasis , acute cholecystitis, allergy, pneumonia, pelvic inflammatory disease, post procedure infection, hypertensive crisis, and a substance-induced mood disorder) and 12 with the 100 mg (colitis, hiatus hernia, acute pancreatitis, non-cardiac chest suicidal ideati on, and acute respiratory failure); however, not all event s may be related to treatment. The long-term implications of prolonged CGRP inhibition are not fully establishe d and safety has not been fully characterized (Amgen [data on file] 2018, Ashina et al 2017, Ashina et al 2018, Clinicaltrials.gov [NCT02873221] 2019, Eli Lilly and Company [data on file] 2018, Stauffer et al 2017, Tepper et al 2018) . There are no adequate data on the risks asso ciated in patients who are pregnant or nursi ng, or in adolescent or pediatric populations. DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION Table 3.

CONCLUSION Migraine is a common, recurrent, i ncapacitating disorder charac terized by moderate to sev ere headaches and disabling features, including nausea, vomiting, neurologic symptoms, phot ophobia, and phonophobia. Migraines have a spectrum of frequency and severity that c an significantly affect the qua lity of life of patients. Clust er headache is less prevalent than migraine and characterized by attacks of severe, unilatera l pain with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms, which occur every other day to multiple time s daily during a cluster period . Cluster headache is more likely to occur in men, whereas migraines are more likely to occur in women. Ubrogepant is indicated for acut e treatment of migraine with or without aura. Erenumab-aoo e, fremanezumabvfrm, and galcanezumabgnlm are indicated for the prevention of migraine. Galcanezumabgnlm has an additional indication for the treatment of episodic cluste r headache. No CGRP inhibitor i s FDA-approved for use in patients aged < 18 years. Guidelines divide treatment rec ommendations according to age, prevention or treatment, and migraine type: Current evidencebased prophylact ic migraine treatment options and guidance are limited fo r chronic migraine, and oral prophylactic medications prescribed for episodic migraine are often used for the prev entive treatment of chronic migraine. Prophylactic migraine treatment options include oral agents (mainly antiseizure agents, antidepressants, and beta blockers), injectable agents (onabotulinumtoxin A for chronic subtypes only), or neuromodulation devices for migraine or headache attacks. Cer tain oral therapies may not be appropriate for individual pat ients due to intolerability or eventual lack of efficacy. Ther e is no optimal prophylactic migraine therapy and head-to-head trials are lacking. For cluster hea dache, subcutaneous sumatriptan , zolmitriptan nasal spr ay, and oxygen have the most positive evidence for acut e therapy according to the AHS guidelines. To date, only subcutaneous sumatriptan is FDA-approved for the acute treatment of cluster headache. Addit ionally, sumatriptan nasal sp ray, zolmitriptan oral formulations, and sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation are proba bly effective for acute tr eatment per guidelines. For prevention of cluster headaches, s uboccipital steroid injections are most effective according to the guidelines; however, there is no preventive medication currently FDA-approv ed for cluster headache. For acute treatment of migraine in adults, guidelines generally recommend the use of APAP, NSAIDs, non-opioid analgesics, or caffeinated analgesi c combinations for or m oderate attacks. The tr iptans or DHE are recommended for moderate or seve re attacks as well as for mild attacks that respond poorly to other analgesics. 77 Data as of December 30, 2019 LMR/AKS Page 12 of 15 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Recent AHS guidelines state that ubrogepant may have a role in patients with CV condition s or in cases of triptan contraindications. It is also noted that other CGRP inhibitors may shortly be FDA-approved for use. There are no head-to-head studies with the CGRP inhibitors and no agent is clearly superior to others. Evidence for the CGRP inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy for the respective indications: Like other preventive medications for migraine, the CGRP inhibitors are not likely to rende r patients migraine-free. Based on 3 to 6 month data, primary endpoint reductions are sim ilar to many oral prophylactic therapies; however, comparisons are limited as endpoi nts have been inconsistently d efined. There are limited analyses and trials examining efficacy in patients who failed 2 prior preventive therapies; however, available data suggest that these patients may achieve greater re ductions in migraine/headache fr equency. Further research is warranted. Compared to placebo, the CGRP inhibitors when prescribed for pr ophylactic migraine therapy consistently demonstrated modest but statistic ally significant reductions in primary endpoint measures (eg, MMD, MMH, or MMHD) ranging from 1.0 to 2.5 day s after 3 to 6 months of treat ment. Overall, the odds fo r a 50% reduction in MM(H)D were approximately 1.6 to 3.1 times higher with the CGRP inhibitors than placebo with numbers-needed to treat (NNTs) ranging from 3 to 10. For the treatment of cluster headaches, galcanezumab-gnlm demon strated efficacy compa red to placebo in an 8- week trial, which allowed for ac ute/abortive treatments during therapy. Galcanezumab-gnlm significantly decreased the mean change from baseline in weekly cluster headache attack frequency by 3.5 during weeks 1 to 3 vs placebo. Additionally, 18.8% more patients were classified as responders ( 50% reduction in weekly cluster headache attack frequency) with galcanezumab-gnlm at week 3 vs placebo (p = 0.0 46). Ubrogepant demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo in 2 DB, R CTs, which reported acute response to migraine treatment after 2 hours. A secon d dose of study treatment (placebo or ubrogepant), or the patient's usual acute treatment for migraine, was allow ed between 2 to 48 hours after the initial treatment for a no n-responding or recurrent migraine headache. Compared to placebo, significantly more pati ents treated with ubrogepant were pain-free at 2 hours when administered the 50 mg (difference vs placebo, 7.4 t o 7.5%) or 100 mg (differe nce vs placebo, 9.4%) dose. For the co-primary endpoint of MBS, significantly more ub rogepant-treated patients reported being MBS-free at 2 hours post dose for the 50 mg (difference vs placebo, 10.8 to 11.5%) and 100 mg (differe nce vs placebo, 9.9%) dose. Lack of information during pregnancy and breastfeeding is a consideration as many migraine patients are women of childbearing potential. The unknown risks of monoclonal antibod ies and the effects on certain conditions are not fully characterized. Furthermore, ubr ogepant has a number of drug interactions, and may not be appropriate with other medications. Important co-morbid populations were excluded from trials (eg, anxiety, depr ession, hypertension, and fibromyalgia), which also limit s the generalizability to broader groups. There are no data in adolescents a nd children. Based on current data, the safe ty profiles of the CGRP inhibito rs are generally mild with the most common adverse effects observed being injection site reactions in SC formulati ons and nausea in oral formulations. Overall, erenumab-ao oe, fremanezumab-vfrm , and galcanezumab-gnl m represent another therapy option in the prevention of episodic or chroni c migraine. Fremanezumab-vfrm i s the only agent in the class that may be administered quarterly, which may fulfill a ni che in patient s who are non-ad herent with treatment. Gal canezumab-gnlm is the only CGRP inhibitor indicated for t he treatment of episodic cluster headaches and ubrogepant is the only CGRP inhibitor indicated for acute treatment of migraines and also the only or al formulation. The frequency of administration (and route or dose) vary by indication. Fur ther long-term study is warrant ed. APPENDICES Appendix A.

Therapeutic Class Overview Antipsoriatic Agents INTRODUCTION The goal of treatment for patients with psoriasis is to control the disease. There are 3 main treatment modalities available at present for the treatment of psoriasis: topical ag ents, phototherapy, and systemic agents. Topical therapies are the mainstay for mild disease either as monotherapy or in c ombination, and topical ther apies are also commonly used in conjunction with photo therapy, traditional systemic age nts, or biologic agents for moderate to severe disease. Phototherapy, photochemotherapy, and traditional systemic agent s are generally used for mo derate or severe disease and in situations in which topica l therapy is ineffective or otherwise contraindicated ( Menter et al, 2011, bet amethasone, clobetasol, triamci nolone, etc.) are the corner stone of treatment for the majority of patients with psoriasis. Their effectiveness in tre ating psoriasis is due to anti- inflammatory, antiproliferative, immunosuppressive, and vasoconstrictive effects. Drawbacks associated with topical corticosteroid treatment are local cutaneous side effects and more serious systemic side effects t hat are associated with long-term use over a large body surface area ( Menter et al 2011 ). Due to these side effects, several agents have been develope d and tested as monotherapy or in combination wi th topical corticosteroids in t he hopes of reducing the durat ion of corticosteroid treatment. Other topical antipsoriatic agent s include anthralin, calcitrio l, calcipotriene, and tazarot ene. These agents are available in a variety of vehicles. Early fo rms of treatment also include d coal tar. In the United Stat es, coal tar use has declined due to lack of standardization of available compounds and the d evelopment of other agents with less cosmetic issues such as odor and staining. Oral antipsoriatic systemic agent s are typically reserved for m oderate to severe psoriasis and are often combined with other therapies. Acitretin, a topical retinoid, modulates the c ellular differentiation of the epidermis and is known to have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activity ( Menter et al 2009[b]). Acitretin is most effective as a maintenance therapy, usually after the diseas e has been stabilized, or in c ombination with other treatments such as phototherapy (Villasenor-Park et al 2012 ). photosen that enhances skin reactivity to ultraviolet ligh t A (UVA). The combination of pso ralen and UVA is referred to as photochemotherapy or PUVA. PUVA is an option for psor iasis that does not respond to topical medications alone or for lesions that are too extensive for topical treatment (Menter et al 2010 ). Agents included in this review are the topical and oral antipso riatics, which are listed in T able 1. Biologics used to treat psoriasis and other inflammatory/immunologic diseases are not included in this revi ew. Topical corticosteroids are also not included in this review.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Various strengths and formulations of anthralin or dithranol have been evaluated ( Fredriksson 1983, Jones et al 1985 ). Results from these trials suppor t efficacy of anthralin in the treatment of psoriasis with no significant differences identified between dosage strengt h, formulation, or administrat ion. Topical calcipotriene has demonstrated favorable efficacy in tr eating psoriasis in several studies with marked improvements in clearing of psori atic lesions occurring in appr oximately 50 to 70% of patients ( Highton et al 1995, Dubertret et al 1992, Thaci et al 2001 ). Treatment success was report ed in patients with psoriasis who were treated with topical calcipotriene foam in two 8-week, multicenter, randomiz ed, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials (Feldman et al 2012, Feldman et al 2013 ). For the treatment of plaque psor iasis, topical calcipotriene has demonstrated favorable efficacy when combined with betamethasone, psoralen plus ult raviolet A (PUVA), and methotre xate ( Buckley et al 2008, De Jong et al 2003, Kragballe et al 2009, Luger et al 2008, Ortonnne et al 2009, Ozkan et al 2012, Torras et al 2014, van de Kerkhof et al 2009 ). The combination of calcipotriene plus betamethasone has demo nstrated superior efficacy when compared to monotherapy with either calcipot riene or betamethasone or place bo in several clinical trials ( Buckley et al 2008, Douglas et al 2002, Guenther et al 2002, Jemec et al 2008, Kaufman et al 2002, Kragballe et al 2004, Kragballe et al 2009, Luger et al 2008, Ortonne et al 2009, Papp et al 2003, Parslew et al 2005, Singh et al 2000, van de Kerkhof et al 2005, van de Kerkhof et al 2009, van de Kerkhoff et al 2004 ). The efficacy of calcitriol ointment for the treatment of mild t o moderate plaque psoriasis was demonstrated in 2 double- blind, randomized controlled st udies involving 839 patients. Ca lcitriol applied twice daily fo r 8 weeks was significantly more effective than the vehicle . Additionally, there were no cl inically relevant changes in calcium homeostasis or other routine laboratory parameters in calcitriol-treated patients ( Lebwohl et al 2007 ). Head-to-head trials comparing the vitamin D analogues have been conducted. Ortonne et al found calcitriol to be significantly better tolerated t han calcipotriol in sensitive s kin fold areas ( Ortonne et al 2003 ). In another 12-week, randomized trial in patients wi th chronic plaque psoriasis, cal citriol demonstrated similar e fficacy to calcipotriol and had a significantly better safety profile ( Zhu et al 2007 ). Head-to-head trials comparing t herapies from different medicati on classes for the treatmen t of psoriasis also exist. Veronikis et al compared calcipotriene to coal tar and found th at bo t h agents were effective in the treatment of plaque psoriasis with no significant differences found between treatme nt groups (p value not reported) ( Veronikis et al 1999 ). Calcipotriol solution has been compared to clobetasol shampoo, with clobetasol being found to be significantly more efficacious in terms of total se verity score measures as well a s global severity score (p < 0.05 for all) ( Reygagne 2005 ). Tazarotene was shown to be mo re effective than placebo in treat ing plaque psoriasis (Weinstein et al 1997). Results demonstrated that both tazarote ne 0.1% and 0.5% gel were signif icantly more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of signs and symptoms of target lesions (p < 0.05). A second, placebo-controll ed trial with the same methodology found similar results ( Weinstein et al 2003 ). Topical tazarotene in combination with a low-, medium-, and high-potency topical corticostero id has been evaluated in patie nts with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis ( Guenther et al 2000, Lebwohl et al 1998 ). While all treatments were effective, the tazarotene and topi cal corticosteroid combination produced significantly higher tr eatment success rates at weeks 2, 8, and 12 vs tazarotene m onotherapy (all p < 0.05). Bowman et al compared the combi nation of tazarotene gel plus ca lcipotriene ointment to clobe tasol ointment in patients with stable psoriasis and found that both treatments were effective in reducing scaling, plaque elevation, and overall lesion severity with no signific ant differences between the 2 groups (p = 0.93, p = 0.76, and p = 0.29, respectively) (Bowman et al 2002 ). The efficacy of topical tazarotene and halobetasol propionate f ixed combination 2 Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind randomized controlled in 418 p atients with moderate-to-s evere plaque psoriasis. More patients treated ta zarotene 0.045%/halobetasol pro pionate 0.01% lotion achiev ed treatment success at 8 weeks compared to patients who received vehicle in both studies (Gold et al 2018). Similarly, in a double-blind, 85 Data as of July 16, 2019 PH-U/KS-U Page 4 of 11 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx. It is intended for internal use only and should be disseminated only to authorized recipients multicenter Phase 2 trial, more patients who received combinati on tazarotene/halobetasol propionate achieved treatment success after 8 weeks compared to halobetasol propion ate 0.01%, tazarotene 0.045%, or vehicle (Sugarman et lotion was also compared to halobetasol propionate 0.05% cream and vehicle in patients with moderat e-to-severe plaque psoriasis. T reatment success was of patients and 3.3% of patients with vehicle (Bhatia et al 2018). Acitretin has been shown to be e ffective in the treatment of pa tients with moderate to sev ere psoriasis in open-label studies and controlled clinical trials ( Olsen et al 1989, Tosti et al 2009 ). In combination with calcipotriol, acitretin demonstrated improved clinical outcomes compared to acitretin a lone or placebo ( Rim et al 2003, van de Kerkhof et al 1998 ). Acitretin in combination wi th phototherapy can enhance treat ment efficacy for patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis that does not clear using UVB, PUVA, o r acitretin alone. Compared with acitretin or UV light monotherapy, the combin ation regimen enhance s efficacy and limits treatment frequency, dur ation, and cumulative doses ( Lebwohl et al 2001 ). Several large multic enter trials have demonstrated the efficacy of oral methoxsalen with U VA (PUVA) in psoriasis, indicating clearance of lesions in 70% to 89% of patients ( Henseler et al 1981, Roenigk et al 1979, Melski et al 1977 ). Two systematic reviews of the la rge majority of PUVA studies ve rified these findings demonst rating that between 70% and 100% of patients treated with PUVA achieved clearing of pso riasis lesions (Griffiths et al 2000, Spuls et al 1997 ). The Agency for Healthcare Resear ch and Quality (AHRQ) published a comparative effectiveness review of the biologic systemic agents compared to nonbi ologic systemic agents or phototherapy on an individual drug level for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. A t otal of 5 randomized clinical trials and 4 observational s tudies were identified. In summary, limited data exist that compare agents. Existing data were considered to be low st rength of evidence, which in general favored the biological a gents over the non-biologic age nts (Lee et al 2012 ). A Cochrane Review was conducted to compare the effectiveness, t olerability, and safety o f topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis, relat ive to placebo, and to similarly compare vitamin D analogues (alone or in combination) with other topical treatments. A total of 177 randomized contro lled trials with 34,808 participants were included. When used on the body, most vitamin D analogues were significantly m ore effective than placebo. Dithranol, combined treatment with vitamin D/cortic osteroid, and tazarotene all per formed significantly better than placebo. Head-to-head comparisons of vitamin D for ps oriasis of the body against pote nt or very potent corticosteroids had mixed findings. For both the body and scalp psoriasi s, combined vitamin D and corti costeroid treatment performed significantly better than vitamin D alone or corticosteroi d alone. When applied to psoria sis of the scalp, vitamin D was significantly less effective than both pot ent corti costeroids and very potent corticosteroid s. Vitamin D generally performed better than coal tar, but findings compared to dithranol w ere mixed. For both body and scalp psoriasis, potent corticosteroids were less likely than vitamin D to cause local adv erse events, such as burning o r irritation. No comparis on of topical agents found a significant difference in systemic adverse effects ( Mason et al 2013 ). In addition to its FDA approval for the treatment of psoriasis, tazarotene, a topical retinoid agent, is also FDA-approved for the treatment of acne vulgar is. In a placebo-controlled tri al by Bershad et al, tazarotene 0.1% gel was compared with tazarotene 0.1% gel plus a vehicle gel, or vehicle gel alone ( Bershad et al 2002). The primary efficacy endpoint, reduction in acne vulgaris lesions, was significant in both taz arotene treatment groups comp ared to the vehicle group (p = 0.002). Clinical trials comparin g tazarotene to other topical retinoid agents have shown conflicting results, with tazarotene being equally or more effective than other topical r etinoids ( Pariser et al 2008, Tanghetti et al 2010 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES The current guidelines for the management of psoriasis and psor iatic arthritis from the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) recommend t opical agents for mild to moderate psoriasis. Topical agents are also used adjunctively with ultraviolet light or systemic medications for resistant lesions or more severe disease . Topical corticosteroids are recommended as first-line treatment for most patients. Other topical agents included in the guidelines are vitamin D analogues, tazarotene, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, anthralin, coa l tar, and combination prod ucts. Combination products include corticosteroid and salicylic acid, corticosteroid and v itamin D analogue, corticosteroid and tazarotene, and tacrolimus and salicylic acid. When used in conjunction with u ltraviolet radiation B or psoralen and UVA phototherapy or biologics, acitretin is effective for psoriasis and the treatme nt of choice in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients with severe ps oriasis due to its lack of significant i mmunosuppression ( Menter et al 2009[a], Menter et al et al 2010, Menter et al 2011, Menter et al 2019 ). In a 2013 position paper published by the AAD, psoriasis patien ts with moderate to severe psoriasis may avoid stepwise-therapy ( ie, first phototherapy, t hen oral systemic th erapies, followed by biologic therapies) and be moved to later line therapy based on disease severity ( AAD 2013 ). Treatment needs vary dependi ng on the severity of disease, 86 Data as of July 16, 2019 PH-U/KS-U Page 5 of 11 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx. It is intended for internal use only and should be disseminated only to authorized recipients body location of disease, characte ristics of the psoriasis bein g treated including lesion thickness, degree of erythema and amount of scaling, as well as patient preferences. Topical retinoids such as tazaro tene are also effective in the treatment of acne vulgaris. G uidelines do not recommend one retinoid over another but do generally recommend these agen ts as a first-line combination option ( Thiboutot et al 2009, Eichenfield et al 2013, Zaenglein et al 2016 ). According to the AAD, topical retinoids (eg, tretinoin, adapale ne, tazarotene) are recommended among the first-line treatment options for the manag ement of acne (strength of recommendation: A [based on consistent and good-quality patient-oriented evidence]; l evel of evidence I [good-quality p atient-oriented evidence, ie, evidence measuring outcomes that matter to patient s: morbidity, mortality, symptom improvement, cost reduction, and quality of life], and II [limited-quality patient -oriented evidence]) ( 2016 ). Topical retinoids are i mportant in addressing the development and maintenance of a cne and are recommended as mono therapy in primarily comedonal acne, or in combination with topical or oral antimicrobials in patients wit h mixed or primarily inflammatory acne lesions. The guidelines do not prefer one topical retinoid over another. There are several head-to-head studies with retinoid products. Some support greater effi and tretinoin, and adap alene over tretinoin, but the concentrations and formulations were varied. Overall, the limitations of the ex isting studies prohibit direct efficacy comparisons of topical retinoids. According to the Medical Letter , topical retinoids can be used alone or in combination with antibiotics to treat both inflamed and noninflamed acne lesions, or for maintenance treatment of acne ( Medical Letter 2016 ). SAFETY SUMMARY Topical calcipotriene is contraindicated in individuals with hy persensitivity to any compon ents of the preparation. Additionally, calcipotriene administration in patients with vit amin D toxicity or hypercalcem ia is also contraindicated. Calcipotriene should not be used for the treatment of the face, and the scalp solution is contraindicated in acute psoriatic eruptions. The most common adverse effects of calcipotriene are local effects including burn ing, pruritus, peeling, stinging, dryness, skin irritati on, rash, and erythema. Contact dermatitis has been reported to occur with use of topical calcipotriene. Systemic side effe cts of vitamin D analogs, including hypercalcemia, are rare unless patients apply more than the recommended dosage of 100 g per week ( Clinical Pharmacology 2019 ). There are no known contraindica tions to topical calcitriol. Amo ng patients receiving laboratory monitoring, hypercalcemia was observed in 24% (18/74) of patients exposed t o active drug and in 16% of (13/79) patients exposed to vehicle. This increase in calc ium and albumin-adjusted calci um levels was < 10% above the upper limit of normal. The effects of calcitriol on calciu m metabolism have not been evaluated for treatment durations of > 52 weeks. Additionally, increased absorption of calcitrio l may occur with the use of oc clusive dressings. Avoid e xposure of treated areas to artificial or natural sunlight . The safety and efficacy of topical calcitriol in patients with disorders of calcium metabolism and patients with erythrodermic, e xfoliative, or pustular psori asis have not been evaluated . The most common adverse effects include hypercalciuria, p ruritus, and lab test abnormalities (not otherwise specified). There are no known contraindica tions to calcipotriene/betametha sone suspension, ointment, or foam. Caution should be used with all formulations in patients with elevated serum c alcium levels. Additionally, hy pothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression has occurred du e to systemic absorption of the topical corticosteroid. Avoid exposure of treated areas to artificial or natural sunlight. Local adverse reactions such as atrophy, irritation, and alle rgic contact dermatitis are more likely to occur with occlus ive use. Common adverse effects include pruritus, worsening of psoriasis, erythema, and burning sensation. Topical tazarotene is contraindica ted in patients who are pregn ant or who have a documented hypersensitivity reaction to any component of the formulatio n. Tazarotene should not be u sed on eczematous skin as sev ere irritation may occur. Additionally, increased photosensi tivity may occur with concurr ent administration of fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and thiazides. Patients should be cautioned to take protective measures (eg, sunscreens, protective clothing) against ex posu r e to sunlight or ultraviole t light (eg, tanning beds) until tolerance is determined. Excessive pruritus, burning, ski n redness or peeling may occur. Discontinue tazarotene until ski n integrity is restored, or reduce the dosing interval or sw itch to a lower concentration. The most common adverse effects include burning, erythema, and pruritus. Topical tazarotene/halobetasol propionate lotion pregnancy. ngs include hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis suppress ion and photosensitivity. Common adverse effects include cont act dermatitis, application site pain, folliculitis, skin at rophy, and excoriation. Local adverse reactions are more likely to occur with occlusive dressings. Topical anthralin is contraindica ted in acute infla med psoriatic eruptions. Addi tionally, the agent should not be used if there is a hypersensitiv ity to the active ingredient or any of its components. The mo st common side effects of anthralin are skin irritation and staining of lesional and adjoining skin, nails, and clothing. 87 Data as of July 16, 2019 PH-U/KS-U Page 6 of 11 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

See the current prescribing in formation for full details CONCLUSION Numerous topical and systemic therapies are available for the t reatment of psoriasis. Topical treatment is considered to be the safest option and is wi dely used for mild psoriasis, fol lowed by systemic and phototherapies, which are used for moderate to severe psoriasis. S election of medication must take into account severity of d isease, thickness and scaling of the lesions, relevant comorbi dities, patient preference, eff icacy, and evaluation of indi vidual patient response ( AAD 2013, Hsu et al 2012, Menter et al 2009[b], Menter et al 2019). Topical corticosteroids are the cornerstone of treatment for th e majority of patients with pso riasis. Drawbacks associated with topical corticosteroid treat ment are local cutaneous side effects and more serious systemic side effects that are associated with long-term use ove r a large body surface area ( Menter et al 2011 ). Several agents have been developed and tested as monotherapy or in combination with topical corticosteroids in the hopes o f reducing the duration of corticosteroid treatment. The vitamin D analogs, calcipotri ene and calcitriol, are other first-line topical agents with p roven efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis. Although less effect ive than topical corticostero ids, they are often used in combination with topical corticosteroids to enhance effi cacy and reduce the risk of atrophy, especially over the long term. One potential advantage of calcitriol is that t here are no known contraindications for use, whereas cal cipotriene (alone, but not in combination with betamethasone) is contraindicated in patients with hypercalcemia and vitamin D toxicity and in acute or actively inflamed psoriatic le sions. Another possible advantage of calcitriol is that it has been shown to be better tolerated in sensitive skin fold areas as well as associated wi th less stinging, burning, edema and erythema ( Weinstein et al 2003, Zhu et al 200 7). The combination of calcipotriene and betamethasone (Enstilar and Taclonex) has been evalua ted in several studies for the treatment of psoriasis compa red to placebo and to its indiv idual components. Overall, r esults indicated that the combination product was more effe ctive in reducing psoriasis ar ea and severity index score s, and it increased the percentage of patients with clear or almost clear disease compa red to either agent alone or placebo ( Douglas et al 2002, Guenthe et al 2002, Kaufman et al 2002, Kragballe et al 2004, Papp et al 2003, Parslew et al 2005, Singh et al 2000, 90 Data as of July 16, 2019 PH-U/KS-U Page 9 of 11 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx. It is intended for internal use only and should be disseminated only to authorized recipients van de Kerkhof et al 2004, van de Kerkhof et al 2005 ). The combination is available as a suspension, ointment, and foam. Tazarotene is the only retinoid agent that is FDA-approved for the treatment of psorias is. Clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy alone as well as in combination with other antipsoriatic agents. G uidelines recommend its use as an adjunct to topical corticosteroids (Menter et al 2009[b] ). No significant differences were observed between calcipotriene or calcitriol and tazarotene in several head-to-h ead studies ( Guenther et al 2000, Schiener et al 2000, Tzung et al 2005 ). Tazarotene is also available in fixed combination with halob etasol propionate. The combination has shown efficacy compared to its individual components (Sugarman et al 2017). Other topical preparations, including anthralin, have taken on more secondary roles and are particula rly challenging as they s tain clothing and skin. Of the systemic therapies, acitretin is the least effective as monotherapy and is therefore often used in conjunction with ultraviolet B or psoralen plus UVA phototherapy. Acitretin does not lead to immunosuppression or the associated risk of infection like biologic agents . Guidelines recommend the use of acitretin in combination wi th phototherapy as first-line treatment for psoriasis when no t contraindicated, before resort ing to other agents including methotrexate, cyclosporine, or biologic treatments (Lebwohl 2001, Menter et al 2009, Menter et al 2010 ). Acitretin should not be used in women of childbearing potential. Methoxsalen and ultraviolet ligh t (PUVA) is an effective method of treating psoriasis. PUVA is indicated in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis t hat is unresponsive to other form s of therapy or for lesions that are too extensive for topical treatment ( Menter et al 2010 ). In a position paper published by the AAD, psoriasis patients wi th moderate to severe psor iasis may avoid stepwise- therapy (i.e., first phototherapy, then oral systemic therapies , followed by biologic therapies ) and be moved to later line therapy based on disease severity ( AAD 2013 ). Consensus guidelines agree that the decision for treatment s hould be based on efficacy, pot ential adverse effects, prior treatments, patient preference, durati on and severity of disease, medical risk factors , co-morbidities, and potential impact on quality of life ( AAD 2013 ). Topical retinoids such as tazaro tene are also effective in the treatment of acne vulgaris. G uidelines do not recommend one retinoid over another but do generally recommend these agen ts as a first-line combination option ( Thiboutot et al 2009, Zaenglein et al 2016, Eichenfield et al 2013 ).

Therapeutic Class Overview Incretin Mimetics & Amylinomimetics INTRODUCTION Diabetes mellitus affects mo re than 30 million people in the United States (U.S.) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2017 ). Diabetes mellitus is defined a s a group of metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia that result from defects in the secretion and action of insulin ( American Diabetes Association [ADA] Diabetes Basics 2019 ). The classification of diabetes includes 4 clinical classes: 1) type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) which results from beta-cell (-cell) destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin defic iency, 2) type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) which results from a progressive insulin secretory defect on the bac kground of insulin resistance, 3) other speci fic types of diabetes due to other causes, eg, genetic defects in -cell function, genetic d efects in insulin action, disea ses of the exocrine pancreas (such as cystic fibrosis), and drug- or chemical-induced (such as in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or after organ transpl antation), and 4) gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (diabetes diagnosed during preg nancy that is not clearly overt diabetes) ( ADA 2019 ). Insulin is the standard treatmen t inhibitors, developed to mimic the effects of endogenous GLP-1 and are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved as adjunctive therapy to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM. As of 2018, albiglutide wa s discontinued by the manufactu rer due to limited prescribing of the drug and not because of safety concerns ( Tanzeum Discontinuation FAQ 2017 ). Pramlintide is the only amylin analog, or amylinomimetic, in th e class, and is FDA-approved as an adjunctive treatment with insulin in patients with T1DM or T2DM who have failed to a chieve desired glucose control despite optimal insulin therapy. It is a synthetic analog o f human amylin, a naturally occurring neuroendocrine hormone synthesized by pancreatic -cells that contribut es to glucose control during the post-prandial period. This review will focus on the GL P-1 receptor ago nists and praml intide and their respective FDA-approved indications for treatment of diabetes. Liraglutide (Saxenda) is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for chronic weight management; however, the use of liraglutide fo r this indicat ion will not be included in this review. and Amylin Analogs Table 1. Medications Included Within Class Review Drug Generic Availability Adlyxin (lixisenatide) - Bydureon - *As a result of a generic settlement agreement, a generic version of liraglutide may enter the market as early as December 22, 2023 ( Coppock 2019 ).

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Dulaglutide The approval of dulaglutide was based on 6 pivotal trials enrolling over 3,000 patients as a part of the AWARD phase 3 program. Trials evaluated the use of dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg strengths. The primary outcome in each trial was the change in HbA1c from baseline to 26 through 52 weeks. AWARD-1 demonstrated that once we ekly dulaglutide resulted in significantly larger improvements in HbA1c at 26 weeks compared to placebo and ex enatide in patients taking maxi mally tolerated doses of me tformin and pioglitazone (Wysham et al 2014). AWARD-2 was an OL study that dem onstrated superiority of dulagl utide 1.5 mg once weekly and noninferiority of dulaglutide 0.75 mg once weekly compared to daily insulin glarg ine in terms of HbA1c red uction from baseline to week 52 ( Giorgino et al 2015 ). AWARD-3 was a DB study that dem onstrated superiority of dulaglu tide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg once weekly to metformin in patients inadequately treated with diet and exercise with or without submaximal dosing of at least 1 oral antidiabetic drug (OAD). At 26 weeks, changes from baseline HbA1c were 0.78% , 0.71%, and 0.56% for dulaglutide mg, and me tformin, respectively ( Umpierrez et 2014 ). AWARD-4 was an OL, noninf eriority study which found th at dulaglutide once-week ly (both 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg strengths) in combination with insulin lispro resulted in significantly greater improvement in glycemic control than insulin glargine in combination with insulin lispro (p = 0.005 and p = 0.015 for dulaglutide 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg, respectively) ( Blonde et al 2015 ). AWARD-5 was a DB trial that compa red placebo, once-weekly dulag lutide (0.75 mg and 1.5 mg), and sitagliptin 100 mg once daily in uncontrolled metformin-treated patients. At weeks 52 and 104, both dulag lutide strengths were superior to sitagliptin in terms of HbA1c reduction from baseli ne (p < 0.001 for all comparisons) ( Nauck et al 2014, Weinstock et al 2015 ). AWARD-6 was an OL trial which demonstrated that, in patients ta king concurrent metformin, dulaglutide 1.5 mg once weekly was noninferior to liraglutide once daily in HbA1c reduction from baseline to week 26 (Dungan et al 2014 ). The AWARD-7 trial was an OL, non-inferiority study that enrolled patients with T2DM and mode rate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) who were c urrently on insulin therapy. Patients were randomized to once-weekly dulaglutide (0.75 mg or 1.5 mg) or daily ins ulin glargine, all in combinati on with insulin lispro. At w eek 26, the change in HbA1c with dulaglutide 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg was non-inferior to insulin glargine (p 0.0001 for both comparisons) ( Tuttle et al 2018 ).

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. The efficacy of exenatide as add-on therapy to metformin alone, an SFU alone, or metformin in combination with an SFU was evaluated in 3 placebo-co ntrolled (PC), 30-week, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) . In all trials, there were significant decreases in HbA1c with exenatide compared to place bo (p < 0.001, p < 0.002, and p < 0.0001, respectively) (Buse et al 2004, DeFronzo et al 2005, Kendall et al 2005 ). Extensions of these 30-week tr ials demonstrated that the benefits of exenatide are sustained ( Blonde et al 2006, Buse et al 2007, Klonoff et al 2008, Ratner et al 2006, Riddle et al 2006 ). A trial evaluating exenatide as add-on therapy in patients curr ently taking a TZD found that at week 16, exenatide significantly decreased HbA1c (p < 0.001), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (p < 0.001), and body weight (p < 0.001) compared to placebo ( Zinman et al 2007 ). When exenatide was compared to glyburide as add-on therapy to m etformin, exenatide significantly decreased body weight and body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.001 for both), whereas the SFU caused significant increases in both (p < 0.05 for both). Both treatments significantly decreased HbA1c, FPG, and postprandial plasma glu cose (PPG) 0.001 for all; glyburide; p < 0.001 for all). Only exenatide si gnificantly improved insulin resistance (p < 0.01) and -cell function (p < 0.05) ( Derosa et al 2010 ). The EUREXA study compa red the efficacy of e xenatide and glimepiride as add-on therapy to metformin. Patients receiving exenatide ex hibited greater reductions in HbA1c from baseline (-0.36%), compared to those receiving glimepiride (-0.21%; p = 0.002) ( Gallwitz et al 2012 ). Several trials have compared ex enatide to insulin therapy as ad d-on therapy to metform in and/or an SFU ( Bunck et al 2009, Bunck et al 2010, Davies et al 2009, Heine et al 2005, Nauck et al 2007, Secnik et al 2006 ). Similar improvements in HbA1c between treatments were observed in 3 of the trials wh ile mixed results were obser ved for decreases in FPG. Specifically, in 2 trials, insu lin therapy was \"superior\" in decreasing FPG (p value not reported and p < 0.0001), while in another trial there was no diffe rence between the 2 treatments (p = 0.689). Insulin therapy was associated with an increase in body weight compared to a decrease with exenatide ( Bunck et al 2009, Heine et al 2005, Nauck et al 2007 ). Patient-reported health outcome m easures demonstrated no differ ences between exenatide or insulin therapy; both achieved significant improvement s from baseline. However, neither treatment improved Diabet es Treatment Flexibility Scores (p = 0.93 for both) ( Secnik et al 2006 ). Exenatide on ce wee kly was also com pared to daily insulin glargi ne in diabetic patients inad equately controlled with OADs. Following 26 weeks of therapy, exenatide was found to be statistically noninferior to insulin glargine for the change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint ( Inagaki et al 2012 ). Exenatide ER Approval of exenatide ER in the management of T2DM was based on the clinical evidence for safety and efficacy derived from the DURATION trials (1 through 5). Exenatide ER wa s added to existing antidiabe tic regimens in 4 of the 5 trials (1, 2, 3, and 5) . In contrast, DURATION -4 compared exenatide et al 2010, Blevins et al 2011, Diamant et al 2010, Drucker et al 2008, Russell-Jones et al 2012 ). Overall, exenatide ER as add-on therapy to existing antidiabeti c regimens significantly decreased HbA1c compared to exenatide 0.005), n (p < 0.0001), pioglitazone ( p = 0.0165), and insulin therapy (p = 0.017), with no increased risk of hypoglycemia . In terms of decreases in body w eight, exenatide ER was s uperior compared to sitagliptin (p = 0.0002) and pioglitazone (p < 0.0001), and sim ilar compared to exenatide (p = 0.89) ( Bergenstal et al 2010, Blevins et al 2011, Drucker et al 2008 ). As expected, GI-related adverse events (AEs) were reported more commonly with the incret in-based therapies. When compared to exenatide, exenatide ER was associated with lower i ncidences of nausea (14.0% vs 35.0%) and vomiting (4.7% vs 8.9%), and hig her incidences of diarrhea (9.3 % vs and injection site-related AEs (13% vs 10%) ( Blevins et al 2011). In the DURATION-4 trial, the decrease in HbA1c achieved with exenatide ER monotherapy was superior compared to sitagliptin (p < 0.001) and similar compared to metformin (p = 0.62) and pioglitazone (p = 0.328). Exenatide ER and metformin were similar in terms of associated decreases in body weight, with exenatide ER achieving superiority compared to sitagliptin and pi oglitazone. Overall, exenatide ER was associated with more GI-related AEs, with the exception of diarrhe a which occurred at t he highest frequency i n patients receiving metformin ( Diamant et al 2010 ). An OL extension of the DURATION-1 trial demonstrated that treat ment with exenatide ER was associated with sustained improvements in glycemi c control over a 7-year period with no unexpected safety findings ( Philis-Tsimikas et al 2018 ). 97 Data as of August 28, 2019 RR-U/SS-U/AVD Page 5 of 15 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

In a post-hoc analysis of 4 clinical trials, patients were treated with weekly exenatide for 52 weeks. Patients had significant lowering of HbA1c, b lood pressure and low density l ipoprotein (LDL) levels without an increase in weight or hypoglycemia ( Bergenstal et al 2013 ). The DURATION-6 trial compared HbA1 c reductions between liraglut ide once daily and exe natide once weekly in patients with T2DM previously tr eated with lifestyle modificati ons and oral agents. Both therapies resulted in improvements in glycemic contro l; however, greater reductions w ere noted ( Buse et al 2013 ). Bydureon BCise formula tion of Bydureon that is adminis tered via an autoinjector dev ice. It was approved based on the results of two 28-week, OL, AC trials. In the DURATION-N EO-1 trial, Bydureon BCise 2 mg once weekly achieved a statistically signific ant HbA1c reduction vs Byetta 10 mcg twice daily (p < 0.05 ) in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with die t and exercise alone or with a stable regimen of metform in, an SFU, a TZD, or a combination of any 2 of these a gents. In the DURATION-NEO-2 tri al, Bydureon BCise 2 mg once weekly achieved a statistically significant HbA1c reduction vs placebo (p < 0.05) in patients with T2DM on metformin. The difference vs Approval of liraglutide in the management of T2DM was based on the clinical evidence for sa fety and efficacy derived from the LEAD trials (1 through 6). The LEAD trials evaluated liraglutide monotherapy (LEAD placebo or rosiglitazone as add-on therapy to an SFU. After 26 weeks, liraglutide (0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mg per day) significantly decrea sed HbA1c compared to placebo (p < 0.0001 for all), with only higher doses achieving supe riority compared to rosiglitazo ne (p < 0.001 for ( Marre et al 2009 ). In LEAD-2, liraglutide was compar ed to placebo and an SFU as ad d-on therapy to metformin. Liraglutide significantly decreased HbA1c compared to placebo; however, similar decreases were observed with liraglutide compared to the SFU. Liraglutide was associated wi th significant decreases in b ody weight compared to placebo (p < 0.01) and the SFU (p < 0.001) ( Nauck et al 2009 ). Results of an 18-month OL ext ension trial were consistent wi th the DB study (Nauck et al 2013 ). In LEAD-3, liraglutide comp ared to an SFU as monotherapy, and liraglutide was superior in decreasing HbA1c (p = 0.0014 and p < 0.0001 for lirag lutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg, resp ectively). In addition, inc reases in body weight were reported with the SFU, while lir aglutide significa ntly decreased body weight (p = 0.027) ( Garber et al 2009 ). In a 1- year extension trial, patients co ntinuing liraglutide for a total of 2 years maintained significant improvements in HbA1c compared to the SFU ( Garber et al 2011 ). In LEAD-4 and LEAD-5, liraglutide was compared to placebo as ad d-on therapy to metformin plus an SFU and to a TZD. LEAD-5 also had an OL arm of i nsulin therapy. Results achi eved with liraglutide in terms of decreases in HbA1c, body weight, and FPG compared to placebo were similar to those observed in the other LEAD trials (Russell- Jones et al 2009; Zinman et al 2009 ). When compared to insulin ther apy, decreases in HbA1c (p = 0.0015) and body weight (p < 0.001) and improvemen ts in -cell function (p = 0.0 019) were significantly gr eater with liraglutide. It was noted that decreases in PPG were not different between the 2 tr eatments, and the likelihood of patients achieving FPG goals were also similar ( Russell-Jones et al 2009). LEAD-6 was a head-to-head trial comparing liraglutide to exenat ide add-on vs 0.79%; p < 0.0001), and a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving li raglutide achieved HbA1c go als of < 7%. Significant decreases in FPG were also achi eved with liraglutide (p < 0.0001); however, exenatide significantly decreased PPG after breakfast and dinner (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0005) ( Buse et al 2009 ). A 14-week, extension trial revealed that patients who were switched from e xenatide to liraglutide achiev ed additional glycemic cont ). Liraglutide was studied in ch ildren and adolescents aged 10 to less than 17 years with T2DM in the PC Ellipse trial (Tamborlane et al 2019 ). After 26 weeks of DB treatmen t, liraglutide wa s associated w ith a significantly greater decrease in HbA1c vs placebo (mean diffe rence, -1.06%; 95% CI, -1.65 to -0.46; p < 0.001), which was maintained over an additional 26-week OL extension (mean difference, -1.30%; 95% C I, -1.89 to -0.70). Lixisenatide The approval of lixisenatide was based on several phase 3 trial s as part of the GetGoal clinical trial program. Lixisenatide 20 mcg once daily was evaluated as monotherapy, in combination with OADs, and in combination with basal insulin (with or without O ADs). Its efficacy was compared with placebo, exenatide, and insulin glulisine.

GetGoal-Mono found that lixisenatid e 20 mcg once daily as monot herapy resulted in significantly larger improvements in HbA1c at 12 weeks compared to placebo in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on diet and exercise (p < 0.0001) ( Fonseca et al 2012 ). GetGoal-F1 was a DB study which found that lixisenatide 20 mcg once daily as add-on therapy to metformin was superior vs placebo in terms of H bA1c reduction from baseline to week 24. The least squares mean change from baseline was -0.26% for the pl acebo group vs -0.72% for the lix isenatide group. The diffe rence was 0.0001) Information demonstrated su periority of lixisenatide 20 mcg once daily as add-on therapy to metformin with or without an SFU compared to placebo in terms of HbA1c reduction from baseline to week 24 ( Yu et al 2014 ). GetGoal-S was a 24-week, DB study which found that lixisenatide 20 mcg once daily in comb ination with an SFU with or without metformin resulted in significantly greater improvem ent in glycemic control than placebo; the difference from placebo in change in HbA1c was -0.58% (p < 0.0001) ( was a 24-week, DB study which found that lixisenatide 20 mcg once daily in comb ination with pioglitazone or without metformin resulted in significantly greater improvem ent in glycemic control than placebo; the difference from placebo in change in HbA1c was -0.48% (p < 0.0001) ( 2013 ). In GetGoal-Duo 1, lixisenatide wa s compared to placebo as add-o n therapy to basal insulin and metformin with or without a TZD. Treatment with lix isenatide resulted in a signif icant reduction in HbA1c at week 24 vs placebo ( Riddle et al 2013a). In GetGoal-L, lixisenatide was compared to placebo as add-on th erapy to basal insulin with or without metformin while in Get-Goal-L-Asia, lixisenatide was compared to placebo as add -on therapy to basal insulin with or without an SFU. Both studies found that lixisenatide was superior to placebo in terms of HbA1c reduction from baseline to week 24 (Riddle et al 2013b, Seino et al 2012 ). GetGoal-Duo 2 was a 26-week, OL trial that compared lixisenatide to insulin glulisine once daily or 3 times daily for intensification of optimized insu lin glargine \u00b1 metformin in tor, glinide). Lixise natide was be noninf erior to both insulin glulisine regimens in terms of H bA1c reduction from baseline to week 26. However, lixisenat ide provided less HbA1c reduction than insulin glulisine 3 times daily and the differen ce was statistically significant; the least squares mean difference of lixisenatide vs in sulin glulisine 3 times daily w as 0.23 (p = 0.0002) ( Adlyxin Prescribing Information 2016, Rosenstock et al 2016 ). was a 24-we ek, OL trial that evaluated lixisenatide v s exenatide twice daily as add-on therapy to metformin. Lixisenatide met the pre-specified noninferiority margin vs exenatide twice da ily for the difference in HbA1c reduction from baseline to week 24. However, lixisenatide provided less HbA1c reduction than exenatide and the difference was statistically significant; the least squares mean difference vs exenat ide was 0.17% (p = 0.0175) (Adlyxin Prescribing 2016, al 2013 ). A meta-analysis (MA) of 76-week data from 5 trials in the GetGo al clinical trial program (GetGoal-M, GetGoal-F1, GetGoal-S, Semaglutide The approval of semaglutide was based on several phase 3 trials as part of the SUSTAIN clinical trial program. Semaglutide was evaluated as mo notherapy, in combination with OADs, and in combination with basal insulin. Its efficacy was compared with pla cebo, sitagliptin, exenatide ER, insulin glargine, and dulaglutide. The primary endpoint, the difference in change in HbA1c from baseline to trial end be tween the semaglutide and comparator groups, was assessed at varying time points ranging between 30 and 56 weeks. SUSTAIN 1 was a 30-week, PC tria l which found that semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg weekly significantly improved HbA1c vs placebo (p < 0.0001) ( Sorli et al 2017) . SUSTAIN 2 was a 56-week, OL trial that compared semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg weekly to sitagliptin 100 mg daily in patients on metformin and/or TZ Ds. Compared with sitagliptin, t reatment with semaglutide resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c from baseline to week 56. The m ean change from baseline wa s -1.3% for semaglutide 0.5 mg, -1.5% for semaglutide 1 mg, and -0.7% for sitagliptin. The difference vs sitagliptin was -0.6% (p < 0.0001) for semaglutide 0.5 mg and -0.8% (p < 0.0001) semaglutide 2017, Ozempic Prescribing Information 2017 ). 99 Data as of August 28, 2019 RR-U/SS-U/AVD Page 7 of 15 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

SUSTAIN 3 was a 56-week, OL trial that compared semaglutide 1 mg to exenatide ER 2 mg once weekly. At week 56, mean change from baseline in H bA1c was -1.4% in the semaglutide group vs -0.9% in exenatide ER group (difference: p 2018, Information 2017 ). SUSTAIN 4 was a 30-week OL, AC trial in patients on metformin w ith or without an SFU that compared semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg to insulin glargine initiated at 10 units once daily. Compared with insulin glargine, treatment with semaglutide resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c from baseline to week 30. The mean change from baseline was -1.2% for semaglut ide 0.5 mg, -1.5% for semaglutid e 1 mg, and -0.9% for insulin glargine. The difference vs insulin glargine wa s -0.3% (p < 0.0001) for semag lutide 0.5 mg and (p < 30-we ek, DB, PC trial in patients inadequately controlled with basal ins ulin, with or without metformin, which found that semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg signifi cantly reduced HbA1c vs placebo (p < 0.0001) (Rodbard et al 2018). SUSTAIN 7 was a 40-week, OL trial that compared semaglutide to dulaglutide once weekly in patients on metformin monotherapy. From a mean baseli ne HbA1c of 8.2%, semaglutide 0. 5 mg achieved a statistically significant reduction of 1.5% vs a reduction of 1.1% with dulaglutide 0.75 mg at week 40, while semaglutide 1.0 mg achieved a statistically significant reduction of 1.8% vs a reduction of 1.4% with dulag lutide 1.5 mg (both p < 0. 0001 for noninferiority and superiority) (Pratley et al 2018). outcomes MC, DB, PC, RCT (REWIND trial; N = 9901) evaluated the long-term effects of dulaglutide vs placebo in patients with T2DM who had either a previous C V event or CV risk factors. A t otal of 31.5% of patients re ported previous CV disease and 22.2% had baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eG FR) < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2. The median follow-up was 5.4 years. The primary composite outcome (CV death, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke) occu rred 12.0% of patients in the dulaglutide group vs 13.4% in the placebo group (hazard rat io [HR], 0.88; 95% confidence All-cause mortality not differ between groups ( 10.8% in the dulaglutide group vs 12.0% in the placebo group (HR, 0.90; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01; p = 0.067). The rates of death from CV causes, nonf atal MI, and hospitalization for heart failure did not differ significantly between groups, while non-fatal MI was statistically significantly different in favor of dulaglutide ( Gerstein et al CT (EXSCEL trial; N = 14, 752) was conducted to e valuate the long-term effe cts of exenatide ER vs placebo, as added to usual care, o n CV outcomes in patients wit h T2DM with or without previ ous CV disease. A total of 73.1% of patients had previous CV disease, and the median follo w-up was 3.2 years. A pri mary composite outcome event (CV death, non-fatal MI, o r non-fatal stro ke) occurred in 11.4% of patients in the ex enatide ER group vs 12.2% in the placebo group (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.00). Thus, exena tide ER was found to be noninferior to placebo with respect to safety (p < 0.001), but not superior to placebo with respect to efficacy (p = 0.06 ). The risk of death from any cause was 6.9% vs 7. 9% in the exenatide ER and placebo groups, respectively (HR, 0.86; 9 5% CI, 0.77 to 0.97); the difference was not statistically significant on the basis of th e hierarchical testing plan . The rates of death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, nonfatal strok e, and hospitalization for h eart failure did not differ si gnificantly between groups (Holman et al 2017 ). A PC, R CT (LEADER trial; N = 9340) was conducted to evaluate the long-term effects of liraglutide vs placebo on CV outcomes in patients with T2DM and high CV risk. The medi an follow-up was 3.8 years. It was found that the primary composite outcome (CV d eath, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke) occurred in fewer patients in the liraglutide group (13.0%) vs the placebo group (14.9% ) (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0 .78 to 0.97; p < 0.001 for noninferiority; p = 0.01 for superiority). Fewer patients died from CV causes in the liraglu tide group (4.7%) vs the plac ebo group (6.0%) 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.93; p = 0.007). The rate of death from any ca use was lower in the liraglut ide group (8.2%) vs the placebo group (9.6%) (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.97; p = 0.02). The rates of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure were nonsignificantly lower in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group ( Marso et al 2016a ). A prespecified secondary analysis found that the composite rena l outcome (new-onset persistent macroalbumineria, persistent doubling of serum cre atinine level, end-stage renal disease, and death due to renal disease) occurred in fewer patients in the liragluti de group vs the placebo group (5.7% vs 7.2%; HR, 0.78; 95% C I, 0.67 0.003) (Mann et al 2017 ). Post-hoc analyses of the LEADER trial have reported that the risk reduction in the primary outcome was consistent in patients with CKD (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.85), a history o f a MI or stroke (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.99), and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular (ASCVD) (wit hout a MI/stroke) (HR, 0.76 ; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.94) (Mann et al 2018, Verma et al 2018 ). 100 Data as of August 28, 2019 RR-U/SS-U/AVD Page 8 of 15 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The risk of acute gallbladder or biliary disease was increased with liraglutide vs placebo (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.09) (Nauck et MC, DB, PC, RCT (ELIXA trial; N = 6068) evaluated the long-term effects of lixisenatide vs placebo on CV outcomes in patients with T2DM who had a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event within 180 days of screening. The median follow-up was 25 months . It was found that the primary e ndpoint event (a composite of the first occurrence of any of the following: death from C V causes, non-fatal MI, non-f atal stroke, or hospitaliz ation for unstable angina) occurred in 13.4% of patient s in the lixisenatide group and 13.2% in the placebo gr oup (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.17), which demonstrated noninferiority of lixisenatide to placebo (p < 0.001), but did not demonstrate superiority (p = 0.81). The rates of the individual CV components of the primary endpoint were similar between the lixisenatide and placebo groups ( Pfeffer et al 2015 ). et al a MC, DB, PC, RCT (SUSTAIN 6 trial; N = 3297) to ass ess the noninferiority of semaglutide as compared to pla cebo in terms of CV safety in patients with T2DM, 83.0% of whom had CV disease. Patients were randomized to semaglutide 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg once w eekly or placebo. The median observation time was 2.1 years. The primary composite outcome was the first occurren ce of CV death, nonfatal MI, o r nonfatal stroke. The noninferiority margin was 1.8 for the upper boundary of the 95% CI of the HR. The primary composite outcome occ urred in 6.6% of the semagluti de group vs 8.9% the placebo group (HR: [95%CI, 0.58 to 0.95]; p < 0.001 for noninferiority). Although a p value of 0.02 for superiority was calculated; testing for superiority was not prespecif ied. Nonfatal stroke occurred in 1.6% in the semaglutide gr oup vs 2.7% in the placebo group (HR: 0.61 [95% CI, 0.38 to 0.99]; p = 0.04). Rates of non fatal MI, CV death, and all-cause death were not statistically significantly d ifferent between groups. Rates of new or worsening nephropa thy were lower in the semaglu tide group, but rates of retinopathy complications were significantly higher (3.0% for semaglutide vs 1.8% for pla cebo, HR: 1.76 [95% CI, 1.11 to 2.78]; p = A MC, DB, PC, RCT (Harmony Outcomes trial; N=9463) evaluated th e long-term effects of the previously available GLP- 1 receptor agonist, albiglutide , vs placebo on CV outcomes in patients with T2DM and established CV disease. The median follow-up was 1.6 years. The primary endpoint (a composi te of the first occurrence of any of the following: death from CV causes, MI, or stroke) oc curred in 7% of patients in th e albiglutide group and 9% in the placebo group (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.90), which demonstrated noninferiority and superiority of albiglutide to placebo (p < 0.0001 for noninferiority; p = 0.0006 for su periority). The rate of fatal or non-fatal stroke was signific antly improved in the albigluti de group, but other individual CV components of the primary endpoi nt were nonsignificantly lower in the albiglutide group than in the placebo group ( Hernandez et al 2018 ). Meta-analyses Meta-analyses and Cochrane Reviews evaluating GLP-1 receptor ag onists have found that they lead to decreases in HbA1c of ~1%, with greater decre ases in body weight and systoli c blood pressure compared to placebo and other antidiabetic agents ( Wang et al 2013, Shyangdan et al 2011, Sun et al 2015 ). A systematic review and mixed-treatment comparison analysis of GLP-1 receptor agonists found that there were no differences in efficacy within the short-acting (exenatide or l ixisenatide) or long-acting exenatide ER were superior to exenatide and lixisenatide at lowering HbA1c and FPG. There were no clinically meaningful differences between agents in weight loss or hypoglycemia. Albiglutide had the lowest risk of nausea and dia rrhea, while exenatide ER had the lowest risk of vomiting (Htike et al 2016 ). A systematic review and networ k meta-analysis sponsored by the manufacturer of semagluti de (Novo Nordisk) found that in patients with T2DM who were inadequately controlled on 1 to 2 OADs, semaglutide 1. 0 mg was associated with significantly greater reductions in HbA1c and weight vs all GLP-1 receptor agonist compa rators after 6 months of treatment, while the 0.5 mg dose achieved statistically signifi cant reductions in HbA1c and weight vs the majority of other GLP-1 receptor agonists ( Witkowski et al 2018a ). Similar results were found in another Novo Nordisk-sponsored systematic review of trials in patients previously receiving basal insulin ( Witkowski et al 2018b ). Meta-analyses have revealed that incretin-based therapies are n ot associated with an increa sed risk of pancreatitis and appear to reduce all-cause mortalit y, CV mortality, and the inc idence of MI compared to placebo or other antidiabetic agents. However, treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists was ass ociated with a significant increase in the incidence of cholelithiasis ( Monami et meta-analysis found that overall, GLP-1 receptor agonists did not appear to be associated with an increase in the incidence of retinopathy, and ther e was a reduction in the inci dence of nephropathy vs comparators (Dicembrini et al 2017 ). 101 Data as of August 28, 2019 RR-U/SS-U/AVD Page 9 of 15 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. A meta-analysis found that treatm ent with exenatide ER did not increase the risk of cardiovascular events compared with placebo or active comparat ors, and may reduce the risk of all-cause mortality (Bonora et al 2019) . Pramlintide The safety and efficacy of pramlintide in patients with T1DM ha ve been established in PC, R CTs when administered in addition to existing insulin regimens. In a 52-we ek, DB, MC, PC study, pramlintide significantly reduced HbA1c from baseline compared to placebo (-0. 39% vs -0.12%; p = 0.0071) and was also associated with a significant weight loss compared to placebo (p < 0.001) ( Whitehouse et al 2002 ). In a second 52-week study, patients experienced a significan t reduction in HbA1c when receiv ing pramlintide 60 mcg 3 times da ily (-0.41 vs -0.18%; p = 0.012) and pramlintide 60 mcg 4 times daily (-0.39 vs -0.18%; p = 0.013) at 26 weeks. Tre atment with pramlintide 3 or 4 times daily continued to maintain reductions in HbA1c a t 52 weeks compared to treatment with placebo (p = 0.011 and p = 0.001 for the 3- and 4 times daily dosing , respectively) ( Ratner et al 2004 ). A review and meta-ana lysis of 10 randomized, PC stud ies (N = 3297) evaluating th e effect of pramlintide as adjunctive therapy to insulin in patients with T1DM found that, compared to placebo, pramlintide resulted in significant reductions in HbA1c (p < 0.001), total daily insulin dose (p = 0.024), mean mealtime insulin dose (p < 0.001), body weight (p < 0.001), and PPG (p = 0.002) ( Qiao et al 2017 ). A systematic review and meta-ana lysis of 8 PC, RCTs assessed th e effect of pramlintide in patients with T2DM and in obese patients without diabetes. F our T2DM studies (N = 930; 16 to 52 weeks duration) and 4 obesity studies (N = 686; 6 to 24 weeks duration) were in cluded. Of the T2DM studies, 3 s tudies used meal-time placebo as the comparator while 1 study used rapid-acting insuli n as the comparator. When endpo int data from all T2DM studies were combined, pramlintide was associated with a small but significant reducti on in HbA1c (mean differenc e: the meta-a nalysis of the T2DM studies, p atients on pramlintide were 1.52 times more likely to reach the HbA1c goal 7% than pat ients in the control group; h owever, this difference was no t significant (p = 0.18). Pramlintide was associated with a significant change in body we ight in patients with T2DM compared to the control group (-2.57 kg [95% CI, -3.44 to -1.70]; p < 0.00001) ( Singh-Franco et al 2011 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES According to current clinical guidelines, metformin remains the cornerstone of most T2DM treatment regimens. If A1C remains above target with metformin alone and the patient does not have ASCVD or CKD, clinicians should consider combining metformin with any The choice o f which agent to add is based on dr ug-specific effects and patient factors. Clinical guidelines note a lowe r rate of hypoglycemia, establis hed efficacy and safety pro file when used in combination with metformin, demonstrated effectiveness in reducing PPG, and the potential for wei ght loss as advantages associated with the incretin mim etics compared to other antidia betic agents. The ADA guidelines recommend that lifestyle management and metformin should be initiated in patie nts with T2DM and established ASCVD. For patients in whom ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD predominates, the best choice for a second agent is a GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated CV risk reduction. The GLP-1 receptor agonist with the st rongest evidence for a CV benefit is liraglutide, followed by semaglutide, then exenatide ER. For all patients who require further intensification to injectable agents, a GLP-1 receptor agonist should be the first choice, ahead of insulin. Current clinical guidelines do not support the use of amylinomimet ics in the management of T2DM. Among T1DM patients, there is limited evidence available to support the routine use of adjunctive therapies, i ncluding pramlintide, to insulin therapy (ADA 2019, Chiang et al 2018, Davies et al 2018, Garber et al 2019, Inzucchi et al 2015, LeRoith 2019 ). The American College of Cardiology (ACC) published an expert co nsensus decision pathway for patients with T2DM and ASCVD ( Das 2018 ). It focuses on the use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in appr opriate patients to reduce adverse CV outcomes. For the GLP-1 receptor agonists, liraglutide is the only agent i n the class with definitive proven benefits of redu cing CV events. In c ontrast, lixisenatid e is not associated with a reduction in ASCVD event risk. Thus, both the ACC pathway and ADA guideline consider liraglutide as the preferred GLP-1 re ceptor agonist in patients with established ASCVD ( ADA 2019, Das 2018 ). SAFETY SUMMARY GLP-1 receptor agonists are cont raindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any compo nent of the products. With the exception of exenatide and lixis enatide, they are also contrain dicated in those with a per sonal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplas ia syndrome, type 2 (MEN 2). 102 Data as of August 28, 2019 RR-U/SS-U/AVD Page 10 of 15 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Semaglutide carries a warning for diabetic retinopathy complications due to the resul ts of the SUSTAIN 6 trial, w hich found a higher rate of events in patients treated with semaglutide vs placebo; the abs olute risk was larger among patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy at baseline compared to those without. Common AEs with these drugs in clude: nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, headache, and injection site reactions. Pramlintide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component of the drug and in those with hypoglycemia unawareness and confir med gastroparesis. It has a boxed warning for increased risk of hypoglycemia, particularly in patients with T 1DM. Common AEs include nausea, headache, anorexia, and vomiting; the incidence of nausea tends to be higher at t he beginning of treat ment and dec reases with time in most patients. Gradual titration of the dose minimizes the inciden ce and severity of nausea. Pramlintide exenatide, exenatide ER, liraglutide, and lixisenatide are accordance with the FDA's Pregnancy and La ctation Labeling Rule (PLLR). There are no adequate and well- controlled studies in pregnant w omen. These drugs should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not kno wn whether these drugs are excreted in human milk. DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION Table 3.

CONCLUSION The GLP-1 receptor agonists ex enatide, exenatide therapies that are FDA-approved as adjunctive ther apy to diet and exercise in a dult patients with T2DM; liraglutide is approved for pati ents 10 years and older. Additi onally, liraglutide is indicated to reduce the risk of major adverse CV events in patients with established CV disease. Pramlintide is the only agent within the amylinomimetic medication class and is FDA-appro ved as adjunctive therapy in p atients with T1DM or T2DM who use mealtime insulin therapy and who have failed to ach ieve desired glucose control despite optimal insulin therapy. The incretin mimetics are available as SC injections to be admi nistered in the abdomen, thi gh, or upper arm. Exenatide is administered twice daily ( 60 minutes prior to meals); liragl utide is administered once da ily (independent of meals); and lixisenatide is administered onc e daily (1 hour prior to the first meal of the day). Exenat ide ER, dulaglutide, and semaglutide are administered on ce weekly. Pramlintide is available as a SC injection to be administered immediately prior to each major meal. The incretin mimetics have been studied extensively in combinat ion with, and in comparison to , a variety of antidiabetic therapies. The agents are signific antly more effective than pla cebo in reducing HbA1c, FPG, PPG, and body weight. Efficacy data comparing treatm ent to an SFU, TZD, DPP-4 inhibitor or insulin is mixed, w ith the GLP-1 agonists achieving significantly greater or comparable benefits in glyce mic outcomes. Several CV outcomes trials eval uating GLP-1 receptor agonists i n patients with T2DM a nd high CV risk have been published. The LEADER, Harmony Outco mes, and REWIND trials demonstrated a statistically significant CV reduction with vs placebo et al 2019, Hernandez et al 2018, Marso et al 2016a ), whereas the ELIXA trial did no t demonstrate a statistically significant difference between lixisenatide vs placebo ( Pfeffer et al 2015 ) and the EXSCEL trial did not demonstrate a statistically sign ificant difference between exenatide ER vs placebo ( Holman et al 2017 ). Although the risk of MACE was lower with semaglutide vs placebo in the SUSTAIN 6 trial, a superiority analysis was not prespecified ( Marso et al 2016b ). the GL P-1 receptor agonists are sim ilar. With the exception of lixisenatide and exenatide, all of the agents have a boxed warning regarding the risk of thyroi d C-cell tumors. Other warnings include increased risks of pancreatitis (including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necr otizing pancreatitis), serious hypersensitivity reactions, immunogenicity, serious hypoglycemia when used in combination w ith SFUs or insulin, and renal impairment. Liraglutide and exenatide ER also have a warn ing for acute gallbladder dise ase, while semaglutide has a warning for diabetic retinopathy complications. According to current clinical guidelines, metformin remains the cornerstone of most T2DM treatment regimens. If A1C remains above target with metformin alone and the patient does not have ASCVD or CKD, clinicians should consider combining metformin with any The choice o f which agent to add is based on dr ug-specific effects and patient factors. Clinical guidelines note a lowe r rate of hypoglycemia, establis hed efficacy and safety pro file when used in combination with metformin, demonstrated effectiveness in reducing PPG, and the potential for wei ght loss as advantages associated with the incretin mim etics compared to other antidia betic agents. The ADA guidelines recommend that lifestyle management and metformin should be initiated in patie nts with T2DM and established ASCVD. For patients in whom ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD predominates, the best choice for a second agent is a GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated CV risk reduction. The GLP-1 receptor agonist with the st rongest evidence for a CV benefit is liraglutide, followed by semaglutide, then exenatide ER. For all patients who require further intensification to injectable agents, a GLP-1 receptor agonist should be the first choice, ahead of insulin.

Among T1DM patients, there is limited evidence available to support the routine use of adjunctive therapies, i ncluding pramlintide, to insulin therapy (ADA 2019, Chiang et al 2018, Davies et al 2018, Garber et al 2019, Inzucchi et al 2015, LeRoith 2019 ).

Therapeutic Class Overview Anticonvulsants INTRODUCTION Epilepsy is a disease of the brai n defined by any of the follow ing (Fisher et al 2014 ): At least 2 unprovoked (or reflex ) seizures occurring > 24 hours apart; 1 unprovoked (or ref lex) seizure and a probability of further s eizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after 2 unprovoked seizures , occurring over the next 10 ye ars; Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Types of seizures include generali zed seizures, focal (partial) seizures, and status epilepticus ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2018, Epilepsy Foundation 2016 ). Generalized seizures affect both sides of the brain and include : Tonic-clonic (grand mal): begin with stiffening of the limbs, f ollowed by jerking of the limbs and face Myoclonic: characterized by r apid, brief contractions of body m uscles, usually on both sides of the body at the same time Atonic: characterized by abrupt l oss of muscle tone; they are a lso called drop attacks or akinetic seizures and can result in injury due to falls Absence (petit mal): character ized by brief lapses of awareness , sometimes with staring, that begin and end abruptly; they are more common in children than adults and may be accompanied by brief myoclonic jerking of the eyelids or facial muscles, a loss of muscle tone, or automa tisms. Focal seizures are located in ju st 1 area of the brain and incl ude: Simple: affect a small part of t he brain; can affect movement, sensations, and emotion, without a loss of consciousness Complex: affect a larger area o f the brain than simple focal se izures and the patient loses awareness; episodes typically begin with a blank sta re, followed by chewing movemen ts, picking at or fumbling with clothing, mumbling, and performing repeat ed unorganized movements or wand ering; they may also be called \"temporal lobe epilepsy\" or \"psychomotor epilepsy\" Secondarily generalized seizures : begin in 1 part of the brain and spread to both sides Status epilepticus is characterized by pro longed, uninterrupted seizure activity. Seizure classifications from the International League against E pilepsy (ILAE) were updated in 2017. The ILAE classification of seizure types is based on whether the seizure has a focal, generalized, or unknown onset; has a motor or non-motor onset; and whether the patient is aware or has imp aired awareness during the event (for focal seizures). Additional classification de tails may also be used ( Fisher et al 2017A, Fisher et al 2017B ). There is variation between the IL AE classifications and many of the Food and Drug Administ ration (FDA)-approved indications for antiepileptic d rugs (AEDs). For e xample, a \"foc al aware\" seizure corresponds to the prior term \"simple partial seizure,\" and a \"focal i mpaired awareness \" seizure corr esponds to the prior term \" complex partial seizure.\" A number of epilepsy syndromes hav e also been described; these are defined by groups of f eatures that tend to occur together such as having a simila r seizure type, age of onset, p art of the brain involved, and electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern ( Epilepsy Foundation 2013). An example is a childhood epi lepsy syndrome called Lennox-Ga staut syndrome (LGS), which is charac terized by several seizure types including tonic (stiffening) and atonic (drop) seizures. In LGS, there is a classic EEG pattern seen and intellectual de velopment is usually impaired ( Epilepsy Foundation 2014 ). Epilepsy management is focused on the goals of 1) controlling s eizures, 2) avoiding treatme nt-related adverse effects (AEs), and 3) maintaining or r estoring quality of life. Managem ent options vary based on the seizure type. It is usually appropriate to refer patients to a neurologist to establish the epilepsy diagnosis and formulate the management strategy (Schachter 2019 ). A correct diagnosis is essential to proper treatment selection. For example, absence seizures are commonly confused with complex partial seizures. H owever, drugs that reduce absen ce seizures are generally ineffective for complex partial seizures, and the most e ffective drugs for complex part ial seizures may be ineffect ive against or even increase the frequency of absence seizures (Epilepsy Foundation 2016). 109 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 2 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. When possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred t reatment approach. Combination therapy may be associated with decreased pati ent adherence to therapy and an increased incidence of AEs and drug interactions. When combination therapy is needed, it is recommended to select prod ucts with different mechanisms of action and AE profiles. There is little compar ative clinical data to support the use of specific combinations ( Schachter et al 2019 ). Several broad classes of AEDs ar e available, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines, hydantoins, and miscellaneous agents (see Table 1). Cannibidiol (Epidiolex) was FDA- approved in June 2018 for use i n pediatric patient s 2 years of age and older with LGS or Dravet syndrome ( FDA news release 2018 ). It is the first FDA-approved d rug for treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome and is the first approved drug that contains a purifie d substance, cannabidiol, derived from marijuana. Cannabidiol is a schedule V controlled substance ( Epidiolex prescribing information 2018). Stiripentol (Diacomit) capsules and powder for oral suspension were FDA-approved in August 2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet s yndrome in pati ents 2 years of age and older taking clobazam. Everolimus tablets for oral suspension (Afinitor Disperz) recei ved an expanded indication in A pril 2018 for use in partial- onset seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) . This product is a kinase inh ibitor that also has several oncology indications. Midazolam nasal spray (Nayzilam) was approved in May 2019 for t he acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity that are distinct from a patient's usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age (Nayzilam prescribing information 2019 ). Several of the AEDs are used fo r additional indications beyond the management of epilepsy, including (but not limited to) bipolar disorder, migraine prophylaxis, and several types o f neuropathic pain. These additi onal indications are listed in Table 2; however, this review primarily focuses on the use o f AEDs for the management of epilepsy. Additionally, brands and formulations FDA-appr oved and marketed only for non- epilepsy indications are not included within this review; these include gabapentin t ablets (Gralise), FDA-approve extended-relea of postherpetic neuralgia and treatment of moderate-to-sever e restless leg syndrome, and pregabalin extended-release tablets (Lyrica CR), FDA- approved only for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral bar biturate hypnotics Table 1.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Overall, the anticonvulsants hav e demonstrated efficacy for the ir FDA-approved uses. Clinic al trial data demonstrating efficacy of the anticonvulsants fo r the treatment of epilepsy is described in the prescribing in formation for the individual products, particularly for anti convulsants more recently approv ed by the FDA. However, the pr escribing information for some older, products (eg, phenobarbital) do not contain efficacy data in their prescribing information. No single AED is clearly the mo st effective. Comparative effica cy data for the management of epilepsy are limited, and trials have generally not shown significant differences among d rugs in terms of efficacy. H owever, the quality of the data is limited and generally derived from short-term trials ( Karceski 2019 ). When possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred t reatment approach. Combination therapy may be associated with decreased pati ent adherence to therapy and an increased incidence of AEs and drug interactions. (Schachter et al 2019 ). Most patients with epilepsy are treated with anticonvulsant monotherapy ( Nevitt et al 2017 ). An evidence review summarized AED efficacy and effectiveness as initial monotherapy for epileptic seizures and syndromes (Glauser et al 2013 ). This publication provides con clusions based on a review of 6 4 randomized trials and 11 meta-analyses. Conclusions include the following: As initial monotherapy for adults poten tially efficacious/effective. As initial monotherapy for children with newly diagnosed or un treated partial-onset As initial monotherapy for elder ly adults with newly diagnosed or untreated partial-onset seizures: Gabapentin and lamotrigine entially efficacious/effective. As initial for adults aggravate genera lized-onset tonic-clonic seizures. For children with newly diagnose t tonic-clonic seizures: are efficacious/effective. 117 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 10 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Oxcarbazepine is potentially efficacious/effective. and phenytoin may genera lized-onset tonic-clonic seizures. As initial monotherapy for child ren with newly diagnosed or unt reated absence seizures: Ethosuximide and valproate are Lamotrigine tiagabi ne, and vigabatrin ma y precipitate or aggravate absence seizures (based on scattered reports). As initial monotherapy for children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes Carbamazepine (not ailable in the United St ates) are potentially efficacious/effective. For patients with newly diagnosed myoclonic, and in some c ases generalized tonic-clonic seizures. There has also been a report that lamotrigine may exacerbate seizures in JME. There is a lack of well-designed randomized trials in epilepsy, particularly for generalized seizures and in the pediatric population. A Cochrane systematic review evaluated the efficacy of AED monotherapy for epilepsy ( Nevitt et al 2017 ). treatment of partial onset seizures (simpl e partial, complex partial or secondarily generalized) or genera lized tonic-clonic seizures w ith or without other gener alized seizure types. This network meta-analysis show ed that for the primary outcome, the time to withdrawal o f allocated treatment: For individuals with partial sei zures, levetiracetam performed better than carbamazepine and lamotrigine; lamotrigine performed better t han all other treatments (aside f rom levetiracetam); and carbamazepine performed better than gabapentin and phenobarbital. For individuals with generalized onset seizures, v alproate perf ormed better than carbamazepine, topiramate and phenobarbital. For both partial and generalized onset seizures, phenobarbital seems to perform worse than all other treatments. For the secondary outcome , time to first seizure: For individuals with partial seizures, phenobarbital performed better than both carbamazepine and lamotrigine; carbamazepine performed better t han valproate, gabapentin, and lamotrigine; and phenytoin performed better than lamotrigine. For both partial and generalized seizure types, phenytoin and p henobarbital generally performed better than other treatments. Few notable differences were show n for either partial or genera lized seizure types for the secondary outcomes of time to 6-month or 12-month remission of seizures. Overall, direct evidence and netwo rk meta-analysis estimates were numerically similar, and effect sizes had overlapping confidence intervals. Data for individuals with general ized seizures are still limite d and additional randomized trials are needed. The generalized (n = 7 studies ) or absence seizures (n = 3 studies) was evaluated in a systematic review and network meta-analysis (Campos et al 2018 ). The outcomes analyzed were seizure freedom and withdrawal due to inefficacy. Compared to valproate, phenytoin had a lower odds of seizure freedom (odds ratio, 0.50; 95% credible Interval [CrI] 0.27 to gene ralized tonic-clonic seizures . Lamotrigine had the highest probability of seizure freedom and valproate had the highest pr obability of withdrawal due to inefficacy in these patients. For absence seizures, ethosuximid e and valproate were found to have a higher probability of seizure freedom compared to lamotrigine. A meta-analysis estimated the co mparative efficacy of achieving seizure freedom with 22 antiepileptic drugs and placebo in children and adolescents ( Rosati et al 2018 ). For the treatment of newly di agnosed focal epilepsy (n = 4 studies), point estimates suggest ed superiority of carbamazepin e and lamotrigine; however, th is was not statistically 118 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 11 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

For refractory foca l epilepsy (n = 9 studies), lev etiracetam and perampanel were more effective than placebo in mixed comparisons. Ethosuximid e and valproic acid were more effective than lamotrigine for absence seizures. The authors concluded that better designed comparative studies with appropriate lengt h of follow-up, well-defined outcomes, and reliable inclusion criteria a re needed to validate these re sults. Approximately 20% to 40% of patients with epilepsy can be consi dered refractory to drug treat ment, referred to as drug- resistant epilepsy. Treatment o f drug-resistant epilepsy may in clude additional anticonvulsant drug trials, epilepsy surgery, vagal nerve stimulation , and dietary changes (the ketogenic diet) ( Sirven 2018 ). Combination AED regimens are an option for the treatment of dru g-resistant epilepsy. However, robust clinical evidence of suitable combinatio ns of AEDs has been difficult to generate due to the large number of possible combinations of drugs and doses. Examples of combinations for which there is some evidence of efficacy include valproate plus lamotrigine for partial-onset and generalized seizures, valproate plus ethosuximide for absence seizures, and lamotrigine plus t opiramate for various seizure t ypes; however, even this evi dence is fairly limited. In general, when considering combination therapy, it is recommende d to combine medications with different mechanisms of action, and to be mindful of the overall drug load to minimize AEs. Two-drug therapy should be attempted before considering addition of a third drug, and high er numbers of drugs shoul d be avoided as they are associated with a very low lik elihood of additional seizure red uction ( Kwan et al 2011 ). A as adjuncti ve therapy for uncontrolled par tial-onset seizures. Most patients in this meta-analysis were on at least 2 other AED s at the time of treatment. In this analysis, eslicarbazepine, lacosamide, and brivaracetam were non-inferior to levetiracetam in terms of eff icacy, but all newer AEDs except brivaracetam had worse tolerability pr ofiles than levetirace tam at high doses ( Zhu et al 2017 ). A network meta-analysis examined t he parti while using monotherapy ( Zhao et al 2017 ). The efficacy outcomes studied were 50% responder rate and st ate of seizure freedom. The authors co ncluded that topiramate, levetiracetam, pregabalin, and oxcarbazepi ne were preferable for their relatively high efficacy and low risk of AEs. Rufinamide was the least preferable medication due to its low efficacy and high risk of AEs. A network meta-analysis was conduc ted to evaluate the efficacy of 17 newer AEDs for treatm ent of refractory partial- onset epilepsy with or with out secondary generalization ( Hu et al 2018 ). The primary outcome was seizure freedom, which was defined as a 100% seizure reduction in the maintenanc e or double-blind treatmen t period of the trial. Safety was assessed by the wit hdrawal rate due to treatment-eme rgent AEs. Based on resu lts of 54 studies that evaluated the efficacy outcome , the most effective agents inclu ded tiagabine, brivaracetam, and valproic acid, and the least effective agents included ru finamide, lamotrigine, and zonisamide. Products with favorable safety included levetiracetam, brivaracetam, and perampanel, while those with the least favorable safety included retigabine (not available in the United States) , oxcarbazepine, and rufinamide. The authors stated that agents with the best outcomes in terms of efficacy and safety included levetiracetam, vigabatrin, valproic ac id, and brivaracetam. Cannibidiol (Epidiolex) was roved in June 2018 for use in pe diatric patients 2 years of age and older with LGS or Dravet syndrome ( FDA news release 2018 ). It is the first FDA-approved drug for treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome and is the first approved drug that contains a purifie d substance, cannabidiol, derived from marijuana. Its approval for these 2 indications w as based on 3 placebo-control led trials in patients refr actory to other treatments. Epidiolex, along with use of ot her agents, demonstrated a signi ficant reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo ( Thiele et al 2018 ; Devinsky et al 2018; Devinsky et al 2017). To date, no comp arative trials have been published. Everolimus tablets for oral suspension (Afinitor Disperz) recei ved an expanded indication fo r adjunctive use in TSC- associated partial-on set seizures in April 2018. Results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 366 patients with inadequately cont rolled seizures on 2 or more AEDs demonstrated a significant reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo ( French et al 2016 ). In August 2018, the FDA approved a second drug, stiripentol (Di acomit), for use in the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. Two multicenter placebo-contro lled studies evaluated the addition of stiripentol to clobazam and valproate therapy i n patients 3 years to less than 18 years of age with Dr avet syndrome. Responder rates (seizure frequency reduced by 50%) with respect to genera lized tonic-clonic seizures were significantly lower with stiripentol compared to placebo ( Diacomit prescribing information 2018). 119 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 12 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

In May 2019, a nasal spray formul ation of midazolam (Nayzilam) was approved for the acut e treatment of cluster seizures in adults and adolesc ents. In one randomized controlle d trial in patients with seizu re clusters while receiving a stable AED regimen, the proporti on of patients who experience d treatment success (seizure termination within 10 minutes and no recurrence for t he next 6 hours) was significantly higher with midazolam nasal spray compared to placebo (53.7% vs = 0.0109) with si milar tolerability (Detyniecki et al 2019 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES Efficacy and tolerability of the n ew antiepileptic drugs I: treatment of new-onset epilepsy . American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( French et al 2004A, Kanner et al, 2018A ). A 2018 update to the 2004 guideline focuses on treatment of new -onset epilepsy with second and third generation AEDs. The 2004 publication summ arizes the efficacy, acetam, and zonisamide for the treatment of children and adults with newly diagnosed partial and ge neralized epilepsies. The recommendations from the 2004 gu ideline include the following: Patients with newly diagnosed ep ilepsy who require treatment can be initially treated with standard AEDs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate. Choice will depend on individual patient characteristics. Lamotrigine can be included in the options for children with ne wly diagnosed absence seizures. The 2018 recommendations include the following : As monotherapy in adult patients with new-onset focal epilepsy or unclassified generalized tonic-clonic seizures: Lamotrigine use be consid ered Lamotrigine use should be consid ered and gabapentin use may be considered to decrease seizure frequency in patients aged 60 years. Levetiracetam and zonisamide use may be considered to decrease seizure frequency. Vigabatrin appears to be less efficacious than carbamazepine i mmediate-release and ma y not be offered; furthermore, the toxicity profile precludes vigabatrin use as first-line therapy. Pregabalin 150 mg per day is possibly less efficacious than lamotrigine 100 mg per day. There is insufficient evidence to consider use of gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate over carbamazepine. There is insufficient evidence to consider use of topiramate i nstead of phenytoin in ur gent treatment of new- onset or recurrent foca l epilepsy, unclassif ied generalized ton ic-clonic seizures, or generalized epilepsy presenting with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Data are lacking to support or refute use epilepsy. Data are lacking to support or r efute use of newer AEDs in treating unclassified generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ethosuximide or valproic acid s hould be considered before lamot rigine to decrease seizure frequency in children with absence epilepsy . An exception would be if there are compelling AE-related concerns with use of ethosuximide or valproic acid. The guideline does not address newly approved agents including cannabidiol, everolimus, or stiripentol. Efficacy and tolerability of the drugs II: tr eatment of refractory epilepsy . American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Kanner et al 2018B , French et al 2004B ). A 2018 update to the 2004 guidelin e focuses on management of tr eatment-resistant epilepsy with second and third generation AEDs. The 2004 publicat ion summarizes the efficacy, and adults with refractory partial and gen eralized epilepsies. Recommendations from the 2004 guideline include the following: It is appropriate to use gabapent in, piramate, oxcarbazepine, patients with refractory epilep sy. 120 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 13 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. Oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and lamotrigine can be used as monot herapy in patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Topiramate may be used for the treatment of refractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults and children. Gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbaz epine, and topiramate may be u sed as adjunctive treatment of children with refractory partial seizures. Topiramate and lamotrigine may be used to treat drop attacks as sociated with LGS in adults and children. Recommendations from the 2018 guideline include the following: As adjunctive therapy in patient s with treatment-resistant adult focal epilepsy (TRAFE): Immediate-release pregabalin and perampanel are established as effective to seizure frequency. Lacosamide, eslicarbazepine, and extended-release topiramate s hould be considered to decrease seizure frequency. Vigabatrin and rufinamide are e ffective for decreasing seizure frequency, but are not first-line agents. Ezogabine (no longer marketed) u se should be considered to reduce seizure frequency, but carries a serious risk of skin and retinal discoloration. Clobazam and extended-release o xcarbazepine may be considered to decrease seizure frequency. As monotherapy in patients with TRAFE: Eslicarbazepine use may be cons idered to decrease seizure freq uency. Data are insufficient to recommend use of second- and the othe r third-generation AEDs. For add-on therapy for generalized epilepsy, immediate-release and extended-release lamotrigine should be considered as add-on therapy to decrease seizure frequency in a dults with treatment-resistant generalized tonic-clonic seizures secondary to generalized epilepsy. Leveti racetam use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency as add-on ther apy for treatment-resistant gen eralized tonic-clonic seizures and for treatment-resistant juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Rufinamide is effective to reduce seizure frequency as add-on t herapy for LGS. Clobazam use should be considered as add-on therapy for LGS. For add-on therapy in pediatric patients with treatment-resista nt focal epilepsy: Levetiracetam use should be cons idered to decrease seizure fre quency (ages 1 mont h to 16 years). Zonisamide use should be considered to decrease seizure freque ncy (age 6 to 17 years). Oxcarbazepine use should be cons idered to decrease seizure fre quency (age 1 month to 4 years). Data are unavailable on the effi cacy vigabatrin. The does not approved agents including cannabidiol, everolimus, or stiripentol. Evidence-based guideline: management of an unprovoked first sei zure in adults. Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Ameri can Epilepsy Society ( Krumholz et al 2015; reaffirmed in 2018 ). This practice guideline makes re commendations based on a consid eration of the eviden ce for prognosis and treatment of adults with an unprovoked first seizure. Recommendations include the following: Adults presenting with an unpr ovoked first seizure should be in formed that the chance for a recurrent seizure is greatest within the first 2 years after a first seizure (21% to 45%). Clinicians should also advise su ch patients that clinical facto rs associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence include a prior brain insult such as a stroke or tra uma, an EEG with epilept iform abnormalities, a significant brain-imaging abnorma a nocturnal seizure. Clinicians should advise pati ents that, although immediate AED therapy, as compared with delay of treatment pending a second seizure, is likel y to reduce the risk of a seizure recurrence in the 2 years subsequent to a first seizure, it may not improve quality of life. Clinicians should advise patients that over the longer term (> 3 years), immediate AED treatment is unlikely to improve the prognosis for sust ained seizure remission. Patients should be advised tha t their risk for AED AEs ranges f rom 7% to 31% and that these AEs are predominantly mild and reversible. Immediate AED therapy after an unp rovoked first seizure is likely to reduce seizure recurrence risk. A reduction in risk may be important, particularly fo r adults, for whom seizure rec urrences may cause serious psychological and social consequences such as loss of d riving privileges and limitations on employment. However, immediate AED treatment 121 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 14 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Decisions should be based on weighing the risk of rec urrence against the AEs of AED therapy, and should take patient preferences into account. It is accepted that when a patient has a sec ond or additional s eizures, an AED should be ini tiated because the risk of subsequent seizures is very high. Evidence-based guideline: treatment of convulsive status epilepticus in children and adults. Guideline Committee of the American Epilepsy Society ( Glauser et al 2016 ). This publication provides conclu sions and a treatment algorithm based on a structured literature review of randomized trials of anticonvulsant treatment s for seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes. A total of 38 trials were included. For treatment in the adult population, conclusions included the following: Intramuscular (IM) midazolam, intravenous (IV) lorazepam, IV di azepam (with or without phenytoin), and IV phenobarbital are established as efficacious at stopping seizur es lasting at least 5 minutes. IV lorazepam is more effective than IV phenytoin in stopping se izures lasting at least 10 minutes. There is no difference in effica cy between IV lorazepam followe d by IV phenytoin, IV diazepam plus phenytoin followed by IV lorazepam, and IV phenobarbital followed by IV phenytoin. IV valproic acid has similar e fficacy to IV phenytoin or contin uous IV diazepam as second therapy afte r failure of a benzodiazepine. Insufficient data exist in adults about the efficacy of levetir acetam as either initial or second therapy. In adults with status epilepticus without established IV access , IM midazolam is established as more effective compared with IV lorazepam. No significant difference in effectiveness has been demonstrate d between lorazepam and diazepam in adults with status epilepticus. For treatment in the pediatric population, conclusions included the following: IV lorazepam and IV diazepam are established as efficacious at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes. Rectal diazepam, IM midazolam, i ntranasal midazolam, and buccal midazolam are probably effective at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes. Insufficient data exist in children about the efficacy of intra nasal lorazepam, sublingual lorazepam, phe nytoin as initial therapy. IV valproic acid has similar effi cacy but better tolerability t han IV phenobarbital as sec ond therapy after failure of a benzodiazepine. Insufficient data exist in childr en regarding the efficacy of p henytoin or levetiracetam as second therapy after failure of a benzodiazepine. In children with status epilept icus, no significant difference in effectiveness has been established between IV lorazepam and IV diazepam. In children with status epilepticus, non-IV midazolam (IM/intra nasal/buccal) is probably more effective than diazepam (IV/rectal). Conclusions included the following (age not specified): Insufficient data exist about the comparative efficacy of pheny toin and fosphenytoin. F osphenytoin is better tolerated compared with phenyto in. When both are available, fosphenytoin is preferred based on tolerability, but phenytoin is an acce ptable alternative. The overall treatment a lgorithm directs that: A benzodiazepine (IM midazolam, IV lorazepam, or IV diazepam) i s recommended as the initial therapy of choice in the first phase of tr eatment (5 to 20 minutes after t he beginning of the seizure). Although IV phenobarbital is established as e fficacious and well tolerated as initial therapy, its slower rate of administration positions it as an alternative in itial therapy. For prehospital settings or where first-line benzodiazepine options are not available, rectal diazepam, intranasal midazolam, and b uccal midazolam are reasonable initial therapy alternatives. In the second phase of treatment ( from 20 to 40 minutes after t he beginning of the seizur e), reasonable options include fosphenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. There is no clear evidence that any of these options is better than the others. Because of AEs, IV phenobarbital is a r easonable second-therapy alternative if none of the 3 recommended therapies are available. There is no clear evidence to guide therapy in the third phase of therapy ( 40 minutes after the beginning of the seizure). 122 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 15 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurolo gy and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society ( Go et al 2012 ; reaffirmed in 2018) This publication provides updat ed recommendations for the treatment of infantile spasms. The literature review included an evaluation of 26 publ ished articles on this topic. Recommendations include the following: Evidence is insufficient to reco mmend the use of prednisolone, dexamethasone, and methylprednisolone as being as effective as adrenocorti cotropic hormone (ACTH) for sh ort-term treatment of infantile spasms. Low-dose ACTH should be considered as an alternative to high-do se ACTH for treatment of infantile spasms. ACTH or vigabatrin may be offered for short-te rm treatment of i nfantile spasms; evidence suggests that ACTH may be offered over vigabatrin. Evidence is insufficient to rec ommend other therapies (valproic acid, vitamin B6, ketogenic diet, or novel/c ombination therapies) for treatment of infantile spasms. Hormonal therapy (ACTH or predni solone) may be considered for u se in preference to vi gabatrin in infants with cryptogenic infantile spasms, to possibly improv e developmental outcome. A shorter lag time to treatment of infantile spasms with either hormonal therapy or vigabatrin may be considered to improve long-term cognitive outcomes. There is a lack of sufficient r andomized trials to provide definitive answers to key questi ons related to treatment of infantile spams. Practice parameter: treatment o f the child with a first unprovo ked seizure. Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society ( Hirtz et al 2003 ; reaffirmed in 2016) This parameter reviews publish ed literature relevant to the decision to begin treatment after a child or adolescent experiences a first unprovoked se izure and presents evidence-ba sed practice recommendations. Treatment during the neonatal period is not addressed. Recommendations include the following: Treatment with AEDs is not indica ted for the prevention of the development of epilepsy. Treatment with AEDs may be consi dered in circumstances where th e benefits of reducing the risk of a second seizure outweigh the risks of pharmacologic and psychosocial AE s. The majority of children who ex perience a first unprovoked seiz ure will have few or no recurrences. Treatment with AEDs after a first seizure as opp osed to after a second seizure has not been shown to imp rove prognosis for long- term seizure remission. Treatment has been shown in sev eral studies combining both chil dren and adults to reduce the risk of seizure recurrence; however, there is a r elative paucity of data from s tudies involving only child ren after a first seizure. Summary of recommendations for t he management of infantile seiz ures. Task force repo rt for the ILAE Commission of Pediatrics (Wilmshurst et al 2015 ). This publication recommends an approach to the standard and opt imal management of infants with seizures. When possible, recommendations are evidence-based; however, when no evidence was available, recommendations are based on expert opinion and standard practice. Recommendations/findings include the following: There is no indication for initiation of chronic AEDs for simpl e febrile seizures. However , in the acute treatment of febrile seizures, it is impor tant to treat seizures lasting 10 minutes or longer. In an otherwise healthy infant, a policy of \"wait and see\" is reasonable after the first afebrile seizure. However, this is a rare event and clos e monitoring is essential. Treatment options with establis hed or probable efficacy include the following: 123 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 16 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Dravet syndrome: clonazepam Provoked or situational seizures: carbamazepine There is no clear evidence supporting an optimal duration of tr eatment; this is dependent on seizure type. Guidelines on neonatal seizures . World Health Organization (WHO) ( WHO 2011). This document was prepared bas ed on a systematic review of the literature and involved co operation between the WHO, the ILAE, and the Internatio nal Bureau of Epilepsy (IBE). Recommendations include the following: Phenobarbital should be used as the first- line agent for treatm ent of neonatal seizures and should be made readily available in all settings. In neonates who continue to have se izures despite administering the maximum tolerated dose of phenobarbital, either a benzodi azepine, phenytoin, or lidocaine may be used as the second-line agent for control of seizures (use of pheny toin or lidocaine requires car diac monitoring). In neonates with a normal neurologi cal examination and/or normal EEG, stopping AEDs may be considered if the neonate has been se izure-free for > 72 hours; the drug(s) s hould be reinstituted i f seizures recur. In neonates in whom seizure contr ol is achieved with a single A ED, the drug can be di scontinued abruptly without tapering the do se. In neonates requiring > 1 AED for se izure control, the drug s may be stopped one at a time, with phenobarbital being t he last drug to be withdrawn. Practice parameter update: management issues for women with epi lepsy - focus on pregnancy (an evidence- based review): and perinatal outcomes. Quality Standards Subcommi ttee and Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommitt ee of the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Harden et al 2009A ; reaffirmed in 2013; Update in progress) This publication summarizes evide nce for selected issues regard ing the clinical management of women with epilepsy (WWE) who are pregnant or planning to be pregnant. Recommendations include the following: If possible, avoidance of the us e of valproate as part of polyt herapy during the first tr imester of pregnancy should be considered to decreas e the risk of major congenital m alformations (MCMs). If possible, avoidance of the us e of valproate monotherapy duri ng the first trimester of pregnancy may be considered to decreas e the risk of MCMs. To reduce the risk of MCMs, the use of valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy should be avoided, if possible, compared to the use of carbamazepine. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avo idance of the use of polytherapy with valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, should be considered, compared to polyt herapy without valproate. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avo idance of the use of valproate d uring the first trimes ter of pregnancy, if possible, may be considered, compared to the use of phenytoin o r lamotrigine. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avo idance of the use of AED polythe rapy during the first trim ester of pregnancy, if possible, compared to monotherapy should be considered. Limiting the dosage of valproate or lamotrigine during the first trimester, if possible, should be considered to lessen the risk of MCMs. Avoidance of the use of valproat e, if possible, should be considered to reduce the risk of neural tube defects and facial clefts, and may be con sidered to reduce the risk of hypospadias. Avoidance of phenytoin, carbamaz epine, and phenobarbital, if po ssible, may be consider ed to reduce the risk of specific MCMs: cleft palate for phenytoin use, posterior cle ft palate for carbamazepine use, and cardiac malformations for phenobarbital use. Carbamazepine exposure probably does not produce cognitive impa irment in offspring of WWE. Avoiding valproate in WWE duri ng pregnancy, if possible, should be considered to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Avoiding phenytoin and phenobarbi tal in WWE during pregnancy, i f possible, may be considered to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Monotherapy should be considered in place of polytherapy, if po ssible, for WWE who take AEDs during pregnancy to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. For WWE who are pregnant, avoidance of valproate, if possi ble, sh ould be considered compared to carbamazepine to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. 124 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 17 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. For WWE who are pregnant, avoidance of valproate, if possible, may be considered compared to phenytoin to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Valproate has the most data show ing an association with risk from in utero exposure. If a c hange from valproate to another AED is planned, it is pr udent to make this change well before pregnancy. Although many of the reco mmendations in this parameter suggest minimizing AED exposure during pregnancy, for most WWE, discontinuing AEDs is not a reasonable or safe option . Discontinuing AEDs may expose the mother and fetus to physical injury from a ccidents due to seizure activity . Practice parameter update: management issues for women with epi lepsy - focus on pregnancy (an evidence- based review): vitamin K, folic acid, blood levels, and breastf eeding. Quality Standards Subcommittee and Therapeutics and Techno logy Assessment Subc ommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Harden et al 2009B ; reaffirmed in 2013; U pdate in progress) This publication summarizes evide nce for selected issues regard ing the clinical management of WWE who are pregnant or planning to be pregnant. Recommendations include the following: The placenta may be factored into the clinical decision regarding the necessity of AED tr eatment for a woman with epile psy. Monitoring of lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and phenytoin levels during pregnancy should be considered. Monitoring of levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine (as monohydroxy d erivative) levels du ring pregnancy may be considered. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute a change in phenobarbital, valproate, primidone, or ethosuximide levels related to p regnancy, but this lack of evid ence should not discourage monitoring levels of these AEDs during pregnancy. Valproate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine may not transfer into breast milk to as great an extent as primidone, levetiracetam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and topir amate. Although many of the AEDs were shown to cross the placenta or e nter breast milk, studies were limited in duration and did not systematically eva luate neonatal symptoms. Guidelines also support the use of AEDs for several common non-epilepsy indications: The American Academy of Neurology and American Headache Society state that AEDs with established efficacy for migraine prevention include valp roate, divalproex sodium, and t opiramate; carbamazepine is noted to be possibly effective ( Silberstein et al 2012; reaffirmed in 2015; Update in progress). The American Academy of Neurology, American Association of Neur omuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine, and American Academy of Physical Medi cine and Rehabi litation state that, for relief of painful diabetic neuropathy, pregabalin is established as effective, and gabapentin and valp roate are probably effective ( Bril et al 2011 ; Update in progress). The American Academy of Neurology states that gabapentin and pr egabalin are of benefit in reducing pain from postherpetic neuralgia ( Dubinsky et al 2004 ). American Psychiatric Associatio n guidelines describe the key ro le of AEDs in the management of bipolar disorder, including the following ( Hirschfeld et al 2002): First-line pharmacol ogical treatment for mo re severe manic or m ixed episodes is either lithium plus an antipsychotic or valproate plus an antipsychotic; for less ill patients, monotherapy with lithium, valproate, or an antipsychotic may be sufficient. F or mixed episodes, valproate may be preferred over lithium. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are alternatives. First-line pharmacol ogical treatment for bi polar depression is either lithium or lamotrigine. When an acute depressive episode of bipolar disorder does not respond to firs t-line medication treatment, the next steps include adding lamotrigine, bupropion, or paroxetine. The initial treatment for patient s who experience rapid cycling should include lithium or va lproate; an alternative is lamotrigine. The medications with the best e mpirical evidence to support the ir use in maintenance treatment include lithium and valproate; possible alternatives include lamotrigine, carba mazepine, or oxcarbazepine. 125 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 18 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Note: This guideline was publis hed in 2002 and cannot be assume d to be current; however, AEDs continue to be recommended for both acute (mania or hypomania) and maintena nce phases of bipolar disorder (Post 2017, Stovall 2018). SAFETY SUMMARY Tolerability and safety are as im portant as effi cacy in determi ning the overall effectivene ss of epilepsy treatment (Schachter 2019 ). Common AEs among AEDs in clude the ( Schachter 2019 ). tremor, anxiety, nervousness, insomnia aggression, irritability, hyperactivity depression, mood alteration confusion ataxia blurred or double vision Examples of rare but serious AEs include the following ( Schachter 2019, individual package inserts ): suicidal ideation and behavior (AEDs as a boxed warnings related to potentially se rious AEs; these include the following: Carbamazepine: Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including TEN and SJS, have been reported. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry hav e found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inhe rited allelic variant of the HLA -B gene. Patients with ancestry in genetically at-risk populations (across broa d areas of Asia) should be scre ened for the presence of HLA-B*1502 prior to initiating treatment with carbamazepine. Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis have been reported. If a pa tient exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient s hould be monitored closely, and discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant bone marrow depressio n develops. Clobazam, clonazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, and midazolam: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in pr ofound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Concomitant prescribing should be reserved for use in patients for whom alternative 126 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 19 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Felbamate: Use is associated with a marked increase in the incidence of ap lastic anemia. Felbamate should only be used in patients whose epilepsy is s o severe that the risk of aplastic anemia is deemed acceptable. Routine blood testing cannot be reliably used to reduce the incidence of apla stic anemia, but it will in some cases allow detection of hematologic changes b efore the syndr ome declares i tself clinically. Felbamate should be discontinued if any evidence of bone marrow depression occurs. Cases of acute liver failure hav e been reported. Felbamate shou ld not be prescribed for anyone with a history of hepatic dysfunction. Treatmen t should be initiated only in individuals without active liver disease and with normal baseline serum transamina ses. It has not been proven that periodic serum transaminase testing will prevent serious injury, but it i s generally believed that early detection of drug-induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug enhances the likelihoo d for recovery. Serum transaminases should be monitored at baseline and per iodically thereafter. Felbamate should be discontinued if either aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) become increased to 2 times the upper limit of normal, or if clinical signs and symptoms suggest liver failure , and should not be consid ered for retreatment. Fosphenytoin and phenytoin: There is a cardiovascu lar risk associated w ith rapid IV infusio n rates. The rate of administration should not exceed recommendations, and care ful cardiac monitoring is requi red. Lamotrigine: Cases of life-threatening seriou s skin rashes, including SJS and TEN, and/or rash-re lated death have been caused by lamotrigine. Benign rash es are also caused by lamotri gine; however, it is not possible to predict which rashes will prov e to be serious. Lam otrigine should be di scontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug related. Perampanel: Serious or life-threatening ps ychiatric and behavioral AEs aggression, hostilit y, irritability, anger, and homicidal ideation and threats hav e been reported. Patients sho uld be monitored for these reactions and for changes in mood, behavior, or personality. The dose should be reduced if these symptoms occur, and it should be discontinued if symptoms are severe or worsening. Valproic acid and divalproex sodium: Hepatotoxicity, including fata lities, have been reported, usually during the first 6 m onths of treatment. Serum liver tests are required and pati ents should be monitored close ly. There is a risk to fetuses exposed in utero, particularly neura l tube defects, other major malformations, and decreased intelligence quotient ( IQ). Valproate should not be given to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical conditio n, and women should use effective contraception while using valproate. Pancreatitis, including fatal hem orrhagic cases, has occurred. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting , and/or anorexia can be sympto ms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. Vigabatrin: Vigabatrin can cause permanent bila teral concentric visual fiel d constriction, including tunnel vision that can result in disability. In some cases, vigabatrin may also damage the central retina and may decrease visual acuity. Baseline and periodic visi on assessment are recommended . However, this assessment cannot always prevent vision damage, and once detected, vision loss due to vigabatrin is not reversible. Vigabatrin should be withdrawn from patients who fail to show substantial clinical b enefit. Due to the risks of vision loss , vigabatrin is available only t hrough a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program ( FDA REMS 2019 ). Healthcare providers who pres cribe vigabatrin and pharmacies that dispense the product must be spec ially certified. Each patient must be enrolled in the REMS program. Prescribers must ensure that per iodic visual monitoring is performed and report any AE suggestive of vision loss to the an antineoplastic, immunosuppressant agent with several adverse reactions. The most common AE that occurred in trials for TSC-associated p artial-onset seizures was stomatitis. More serious AEs include: 127 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 20 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

These products vary in terms of t heir indications for specific seizure types and indications other than epilepsy. Overall, the anticonvulsants hav e demonstrated efficacy for the ir FDA-approved uses. Whe n possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred treatment approach. Patients who are refractory to monotherapy may be treated with combination therapy. When considering combination therapy, it is recommended to combine medications with differen t mechanisms of action and AE profiles. Comparative efficacy data for the management of epilepsy are limited. Tolerability and safety are as im portant as effi cacy in determi ning the overall effectiveness of epilepsy treatment. Both systemic AEs and neurologic AEs commonly occur. Some AEDs are a ssociated with rare but serious AEs, and careful patient selection and monitoring are required. Epilepsy management can be complex and is often performed by ne urologists. A variety of AEDs should be available to allow clinicians to select the most clinically appropriate agen t for individual patients. Anticonvulsants are also establis hed as effective for several non-epilepsy indications, including (but not limited to) bipolar disorder, migraine prophylaxis, and neuropathic pain. 131 Data as of July 19, 2019 HJI-U/JZ-U/AKS Page 24 of 26 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Therapeutic Class Overview Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors INTRODUCTION Approximately 121.5 million American adults are living with some form of cardiovascular (C V) disease or the after- effects of stroke, a ccording to the American Heart Association (AHA) Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics 2019 update (Benjamin et al 2019). CV disease is the number one caus e of death in the United Stat es. Hypertension (HTN) is an independe nt risk factor for CV disease and increases the mortalit y risks of CV disease and other diseases (Benjamin et al 2019). The 2017 American College of Cardi ology (ACC)/AHA clinical pra ctice guideline defines HTN as blood pressure (BP) 130/80 mm Hg ( Whelton et al 2018). Nearly half of American adults (46%) have HTN based on this definition. Lowering of BP has bee n shown to reduce the risk of fatal and nonfatal CV events including stroke and myocardial infarctions (MIs). Lipid contro l, diabetes mellitus (DM) manage ment, smoking cessation, exercise, weight management, and limiting sodium intake may also reduce CV risk (Benjamin et al 2019). Numerous classes of antihyperte nsives are avail able to reduce B P. Some examples of antihypertensives include diuretics, angiotensin converting blockers (CCBs ). Selection of antihypertens ive therapy for a specific patient is determined by patient characteristics such as ethnic group, and the presence of compelling indications such as heart failure (HF), DM, chronic kidney disease (CKD), h istory of stroke or MI, and risk factors for coronary heart d isease (CHD). Some patients require 2 or more antihypertens ives from different pharmacologi cal classes to achieve BP control (Go et al 2014, Weber et al 2014, Whelton et al 2018). In general, guideline-recommended BP goals in hypertensive adults range from < 130/80 mm Hg to < 140/90 mm Hg (American Diabetes Association 2019, de Boer et al 2017, Whelton et al 2018). BP goals for older patients hav e long been a point of debate. The SPRINT trial followed patie nts 50 years with high BP and increased CV risks under intense hypertensive treatment (systolic blood pressure [SBP] goal of < 120 mm Hg) compared to standard HTN treatment (SBP goal of < 140 mm Hg ) over a period of 3.2 years. The trial ended early; however, results demonstrat ed a reduced primary composit e outcome of MI, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), stroke, HF, or CV death driven ma inly by reduced HF events and CV death with intense treatment compared to standard treatment. The SPRINT trial pointed to potential clini cal benefits associated with m ore intensive treatment in certain patients, although early termination of the trial and variations in the BP-measur ement technique employed have called into question the gene ralizability of the results (SPRINT Research Group 2015). A guideline from the American College of Physicians (ACP) and t he American Academy of Fam ily Physicians (AAFP) on treatment of HTN in adults age d 60 years recommends standa rd and intense SBP treatment goals of < 150 mm Hg and < 140 mm Hg, respectively , with more intense BP reductio n reserved for patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (Qaseem et al 2017). This review includes the ACE-Is and the ACE-I combination produ cts. The ACE-Is are Food and Drug Adm inistration (FDA)-approved to t reat HTN, HF, left ventricular (LV) diabetic nephropathy, acute myocard ial infarction (AMI) to impr ove survival, and stable coro nary artery disease (CAD) to reduce the risk of CV mortality or nonfatal MI. The ACE-I combinations are produ cts that combine an ACE-I or verapamil) in a fixed-dose formulation. By combining agents from different c lasses, these combination products are meant to increase t he effectiveness of antihyperte nsive therapy through complementary mechanisms of action while minimizing the potential for dose-related adverse effects.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY ACE-Is have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of HTN in a dults.

On average, SBP was 138 Data as of November 18, 2019 CK-U/RR-U/AP Page 4 of 13 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

There were no clinically meaningful BP lowering differences among the various ACE-Is (Heran et al 2008). Enalapril has demonstrated effi cacy for the treatment of HTN in children aged 6 to 16 years (Wells et al 2002). Meta-analyses have shown that ACE -Is and ARBs have similar long -term effects on BP (Sanders et al 2011, Savarese et al 2013). Additionally, a Cochrane review involving 11,007 subjects with primary HTN found no evidence of a difference in total mortality or CV outcomes for ACE-Is in comparison to ARBs ( Li 2014 ). ACE-Is have been shown to be effe ctive for CAD and in reducing the risk for CV mortality, MI, and stroke in clinical trials (ADVANCE Collaborative Group 2007, Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaborat ion 2007, Dahlof et al 2005, Fox et al 2003, Nissen et al 2004, ONTARGET Invest igators 2008, Pilote et al 2004, Pitt et al 2003, PREAMI Investigators 2006, PROGRESS Collaborative Group 2001, Sanders et al 2011, Savarese et al 2013, Swedberg et al 1992, The Heart Outcomes Prevention Ev aluation Study Investigators 2000, Th e PEACE Trial Invest igators 2004, van Vark et al 2012, Zoungas et al 2014). Additionally, in a retrospectiv e analysis of patients > 65 year s of age, ramipril was associat ed with significantly lower mortality 1 year after MI compared to captopril, enalapril, fos inopril, lisinopril, and quinapril. There were no significant differences between ramipril and perindopril (Pilote et al 2004). In meta-regression analyses of 26 large-scale trials, ACE-Is and ARBs appeared to have similarly beneficial BP- dependent effects for risk reduction of stroke, CHD, and HF (Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration 2007). For patients with mitral regurgi tation secondary to MI, both AC E-Is and ARBs have been show n to improve prognosis (Okura et al 2016). Clinical trials have demonstrat ed the efficacy of ACE-Is in red ucing mortality associat ed with congestive HF (Cohn et al 1991, Dickstein et al 2002, Dobre et al 2008, Kober et al 1995, Lee et al 2004, Mc Kelvie et al 1999, Packer et al 1999, Pfeffer et al 1992, Pfeffer et al 2003, Pitt et al 1997, Pitt et al 2000, The Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy [AIRE] Study Investigators 1993, The CONSENSUS Trial Study Group 1987, The SOLVD Investi gators 1991, The SOLVD Investigators 1992, Tu et al 2005). No significant differences wer e noted when ACE-Is and ARBs were compared (Dickstein et al 2002, Lee et al 2004, McKelvie et al 1999, Pfeffer et al 2003, Pitt et al 1997, Pitt et al 2000). ACE-Is have also shown efficac y for protection against the development of progressive nephr opathy in patients with DM (Barnett et al 2004, Casas et al 2005, Hou et al 2007, Mo rgensen et al 2000, Ruggenenti et al 2004, The GISEN Group 1997, Wright et al 2002). In patients with type 2 DM, combi nation treatment with perindopril and indapamid e reduced SBP and significantly decreased micro- and macrov ascular events vs placebo (ADVANCE Collaborative Group 2007, Zoungas et al 2014). In a meta-analysis comparing AC E-Is to ARBs for preventing the progression of diabetic kidney disease, the effects on renal outcomes were similarly beneficial between the groups (Strippoli et al 2006). In a meta-analysis of patients with CKD, including those with diabetic and nondiabetic nephrop athy, both ACE-Is and AR Bs reduced the risk of kidney failure compared to other active agents and placebo, and reduced CV events co mpared to placebo (Xie et al 2016). However, only ACE-Is reduced th e risk of all-cause mortality compared to other active agents. A meta-analysis of randomized anti hypertensive trials in patien ts with DM and microalbum inuria found that reduction in albuminuria among normotensiv e patients was greatest with tr andolapril plus candesartan , followed by trandolapril monotherapy. In reduct in albuminuria was with fosinopr il plus amlodipine, followed by fosinopril monotherapy. However, the combination therapies h ad inferior safety profile s when compared to ACE-I monotherapy with respect to dry cough, p resyncope, and peripher al edema (Huang et al 2017). In a recent trial enrolling adolescents with type 1 DM, the add ition of an ACE-I did not change the albumin-to- creatinine ratio over 2 to 4 y ears of treatment vs placebo. However, the use of an ACE-I was associated with a lower incidence of microalbuminuria. The short duration of the trial was cited as an important limitation, and follow-up to evaluate the potential benefits o f early intervention in this p opulation is necessary (Marcovecchio et al 2017). Clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of some ACE -I combination products compared to other ACE-I combination products or when compared to monotherapy (Chrysant et al 2004, Chrysant et al 2007, Fogari et al 1997, Hilleman et al 1999, Jamerson et al 2004, Kuschnir et al 1996, Messerli et al 2000, Neutel et al 2005). Benazepril/amlodipine has demonst rated superior CV outcomes com pared to benazepril/HCTZ (Bakris et al 2010, Jamerson et al 2008, Weber et al 2010) . In addition, benazepril/amlodipine has demonstrated higher antihypertensive efficacy compared to captopril/HCTZ (Malacco et al 2002) and olmesartan/HCTZ (Kereiakes et al 2007). 139 Data as of November 18, 2019 CK-U/RR-U/AP Page 5 of 13 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. Benazepril/amlodipine also demon strated noninferiority to valsa rtan/HCTZ in lowering o f DBP over 16 weeks in patients with HTN and DM (Lee et al 2012). When lisinopril/HCTZ was compared to a combination ARB, candesa rtan/HCTZ, no significant difference in antihypertensive efficacy was i dentified; however, the proportion of patients reporting a t least 1 adverse event was significantly greater in the lisinopril/HCTZ group (McInnes et al 2000). Trandolapril/verapamil has been as sociated with a significantly greater reduction of BP compared to either component as monotherapy (Brunner et al 2007, Cifkova et al 2000, Karlber g et al 2000, Pepine et al 2003, Pepine et al 2006, Ruggenenti et al 2004). In 728 black patients from sub-Sah aran Africa, blood pressure r eductions were greater w ith amlodipine/HCTZ and amplodipine/perindopril than perindopril/HCTZ at 6 months ( Ojji et al 2019). Studies have demonstrated that t he combination of 2 renin angio tensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS) inhibitors, including an ACE-I combined with an ARB, provides no renal or CV benefits and may lead to significant adverse events, particularly in patients with d iabetes and/or renal insufficien cy. Most notably, patients rece iving combination therapy had increased rates of hyperkalemi a, hypotension, and renal dysfunc tion. All agents in this class have safety warnings against combined use (Fried et al 2013, ONTARGET Investigators 2008, Parving et al 2012, Pfeffer et al 2003, Sakata et al 2015). CLINICAL GUIDELINES The 2017 ACC/AHA guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high BP in adults (Whelton et al 2018) offers updated classifications of HTN and goals of treatment ( see Table 4). Table 4. Classification of BP measurements BP Category BP Treatment or follow-up Normal SBP < 120 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg Evaluate yearly; promote optimal lifestyle habits. Elevated SBP 120 - 129 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg Evaluate in 3 to 6 months; lif estyle changes are recommended. HTN stage 1 SBP 130 - 139 mm Hg or DBP 80 - 89 mm Hg Assess the 10-year risk for hear t disease and stroke using the ASCVD risk calculator. If ASCVD risk is < 10%, lifestyle changes are recommended. A B P target of < 130/80 mm Hg may be reasonable. If ASCVD risk is 10%, or th e patient has known CVD, DM, or CKD, lifestyle changes and 1 BP-lowering medication are recommended. A target BP of < 130/80 mm Hg is recommended. HTN stage 2 SBP 140 mm Hg or DBP 90 mm Hg Lifestyle changes and BP-lowering medication from 2 different classes are recommended. Abbrv: ASCVD=atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, BP=blood pressure, CKD=chronic kidney =diabetes mellitus, HTN=hypertension, SBP=systolic blood pressure In patients with stage 1 HTN, i t is reasonable to initiate ther apy with a single antihyperte nsive agent. In patients with stage 2 HTN and BP more than 20/10 mm Hg higher than their target, 2 first-line agents of different classes should be initiated. First-line -bloc kers have been shown to prevent CVD compared with placebo. ACE-Is were notably less effect ive in preventi ng HF and stroke compared with CCBs in b lack patients. ARBs may be better tolerated than ACE-I s in black patients, with les s cough and angioedema, but they offer no proven advantage over ACE-Is in preventing stroke or CVD in this population; thiazide diuretics (especially chlorthalidone) or CCBs are the best initial choice for single-drug therapy in this population, or as initial agents in a multidrug regimen. An ACE-I is a preferred drug fo r treatment of HTN for those with CKD stage 3, or for stage 1 or 2 with albuminuria. 140 Data as of November 18, 2019 CK-U/RR-U/AP Page 6 of 13 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. The American Diabetes Associati on position statement on DM and HTN recommends that most patients with DM and HTN be treated to a goal BP of < 140/90 mm Hg. Lower BP targets such as < 130/80 mm Hg may be appropriate for individuals at high risk of CVD (American Diabetes Association 2019, de Boer et al 2017) . Treatment for HTN should include drug classes demonstrated to r educe Patients with BP 160/100 mm Hg should have prompt initiation of 2 drugs or a single-pill combination of drugs demonstrated to reduce CV ev ents in patients with DM. An ACE-I or ARB, at the maximum tolerated dose indicated for BP treatment, is the recommende d first-line treatment for HTN in patients with DM and a urine albumin-to-creatinine r atio 30 mg/g creatinine. The American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline for high BP in children a nd adolescents recommends that the treatment goal with nonphar macologic and pharmacologic therapy should be a reduct ion in SBP and DBP to < 90th percentile and < 1 30/80 mm Hg in adolesc ents 13 years old (Flynn et al 2017) . In hypertensive children and adolescents who have failed lifest yle modifications, clinic ians should initiate pharmacologic treatment with an ACE-I, ARB, long-acting CCB, or thiazide Children and adolescents with C KD, HTN, and proteinuria should be treated with an ACE-I or ARB. Various other guidelines and position statements place ACE-Is a s first-line therapy in patients with DM and microalbuminuria; with stable C AD and HTN; with HF; and after a n MI. ACE-Is have demonstra ted clinical benefit and reductions in morbidity and mortality in these populations (Amsterdam et al 2014, Go et al 2014, Rosendorff et al 2015, Weber et al 2014, Yancy et al 2017). Due to differences in the activi ty of the RAAS, ACE-Is are often less effective as HTN mon otherapy in black patients (African or Caribbean descent). A lternative first-line options for these patients include CCBs and thiazide diuretics (Weber et al 2014). SAFETY SUMMARY Boxed Warnings When pregnancy is detected, ACE -Is should be discontinued as soon as possible. Drugs that act directly on the RAAS can cause injury and deat h to the developing fetus. Contraindications ACE-Is are contraindicated in patients with angioedema or with a history of hereditary o r idiopathic angioedema. ACE-Is are sacubitril) . An ACE-I should not 36 hours of a neprilysin inhibitor. ACE-Is are contraindicated in c pat ients with DM; the combinatio n should also be avoided in patients with renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate [GFR ] < 60 mL/min/1.73m2). ACE-I combinations with HCTZ are contraindicated in patients wi anuria. Due to the verapamil component, trandolapril/verapamil is contraindicated in patients with severe LV dysfunction, hypotension or cardiogenic shock , sick sinus syndrome, second o r third degree atrioventricular (AV) block, patients with atrial flutter or fibrillation an d an accessory bypass, and pat ients taking flibanserin. Warnings and Precautions ACE-Is have warnings for anaphyla ctoid reactions including head and angioedema hyperkalemia; and cholestatic jaundice failure. Captopril has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression rarely in patients with uncomplicated HTN, but more frequently in patients with renal i mpairment, especially if they also have a collagen- vascular disease such as systemi c lupus erythematosus or sclero derma. Available data fr om clinical trials are insufficient to show that other ACE-Is do not cause agranulocyt osis at similar rates. Verapamil has a negative inotropic effect, which is compensated by its afterload reduction (d ecreased systemic vascular resistance) properties without a net impairment of ventricular performance. However, conge stive HF and/or pulmonary edema have been reported. Verapam il-containing products should be avoided in patients wi th severe LV dysfunction (eg, ejection fraction < 30%, pulmonary wedge pressure > 20 mm Hg, or severe symptoms of cardiac failure) and in patients with any degr ee of ventricular dysfunction if they are receiving a -blocker. Perindopril/amlodipine is not rec ommended in patients with HF. Use caution with amlodipine i n patients suffering from obs tructive hypertr ophic 141 Data as of November 18, 2019 CK-U/RR-U/AP Page 7 of 13 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

HCTZ may alter glucose tolerance and raise levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and serum ur ic acid levels (which may precipitate gout). HCTZ may cause elevations of serum calcium a nd monitoring is recommended in patients with hypercalcemia. Adverse Effects Common adverse effects of ACE-Is include headache, dizziness, c ough, and hypotension. ACE-Is may cause electrolyte abnor malities and elevations of bl ood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. Some combination products conta in amlodipine, which may cause p eripheral edema. Important Drug Interactions Dual blockade of the RAAS with ARBs, ACE-I, or aliskiren is ass ociated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in ren al function (including acute re nal failure), compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the comb ination of 2 RAAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In patients who are el derly, volume-deplet ed (including those o n diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NS AIDs) with ACE-Is may resu lt in deterioration of renal function, including acute renal failure. The antihypertensive e ffect of ACE-Is may be attenuated by the risk hyperkalemia. Patients taking mammalian ncreased risk for angioedema with concomitant ACE-I use. Verapamil has drug interactions with colchicine, digoxin, immun osuppressants, and several others. Consult the prescribing information for tr andolapril/verapamil for the full listing and descriptions. DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION All ACE-I-containing products, w ith the exception of fosinopril , require dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment. The combination ACE-I products a re not recommended for use in p atients with severe renal impairment and should be used with caution in patient s with hepatic impairment. Breastfeeding is not recommended while on ACE-I-containing prod ucts. Table 5.

Combination t herapy may be initiated after failure on monotherapy or substit uted for the titrated individual components. See the current prescribing information for full details. CONCLUSION The single-entity and combinati on ACE-I products are FDA-approv ed for the treatment of HTN , and most are generically available. Most single-entity A CE-Is are also approved for the treatment of HF. With the exce ption of captopril/HCTZ and perindopril/amlodipine, the combi nation ACE-Is are not approved for use as initial HTN therapy. Evidence-based guidelines recogni ze the important role ACE-Is p lay in the treatment of HTN and other CV and renal diseases. There is no consensus on BP goals for certain populat ions such as older patient s and patients with DM. The current ACC/AHA guidelines (Whelton et al 2018) recommend a BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg for most patients. ACE-Is have demonstrated effica cy in the treatment of HTN, for protection against progressi ve nephropathy in patients with DM, for reducing mortality associated with HF, and for red ucing the risk of CV mortality, MI, and stroke in patients with CAD. ACE-Is have generally demonstrated comparable efficacy to ARBs across indications. Studies have demonstrated that t he combination of 2 RAAS inhibitors, including an ACE-I w ith an ARB, provides no renal or CV benefits and may incr ease risk of adverse events, i ncluding hyperkalemia, hypotension, and renal dysfunction. All agents in this c lass have safety warnings agai nst combined use. All ACE-Is have a boxed warning for use in pregnancy and are co ntraindicated in patients wi th a history of angioedema. Other warnings include anaphylact oid reactions including head and angioedema, hypot ension, hyperkalemia, and cholestatic jaundice and hepatic failure. adverse effects of ACE-Is include headache, dizziness, c ough, and hypotension . ACE-Is may cause electrolyte abnormalities and in creases in BUN and creatinine. Current guidelines recommend ACE- Is as a first-line therapy for patients with HTN, DM with microalbuminuria, stable CAD with HTN, HF, and post-MI (American Diabetes Association 2019, Amster dam et al 2014, de Boer et al 2017, Go et al 2014, Rosendorff et al 2015, Weber et al 2014, Whelton et al 20 18, Yancy et al 2017). Due to differences in the activi ty of the RAAS, ACE-Is are often less effective patients; CCBs and thiazide diuretics shoul d be used as option s in these patients.

Therapeutic Class Overview Opioids, Long Acting INTRODUCTION Pain originates from somatic or visceral structures. Somatic pa in is localized and typically results from injury or disease of the skin, musculoskeletal str uctures, and joints. Visceral p ain arises from internal organ dysfunction or from functional pathology. Pain can be acute or chronic. Acu te pain often results from inj ury or inflammation and may have a survival role and assist in the healing process by minimizing re-injury. In contr ast, chronic pain, often defined a s pain persisting for over three to six months, may be cons idered a disease in that it ser ves no useful purpose ( Cohen et al 2016 ). A 2016 study estimated that approximately 50 million adults in the United States hav e chronic pain, and approximately 20 million have high-impact chronic pain (ie, pai n that limits life or work ac tivities on most days). Each year, chronic pain contributes to an estimated $560 billion in direct medical costs, lost p roductivity, and disability programs ( Dahlhamer et al 2018 ). Pain may be classified as nocic eptive and neuropathic pain. Nociceptive pain, including canc er pain, results from an injury or disease affecting somati c structures such as skin, muscle, tendons and ligaments, bone, and joints. It is typicall y treated with nonopioid analgesics or opioids. Neuropathic pain results from d isease or injury to the peripher al or central nervous sy stems (CNS) and is less responsive to opioids. It is oft en treated with adjuvant drugs such as antidepressants and ant iepileptics. Opioids are recommended as second- or third-line agents ( et al 2016 ). Several pharmacologic and nonphar macologic options are currentl y available for the management of pain. Treatment options include pharmacologic tr eatment, physical medicine, beh avioral medicine, neuromodulation, interventional, and surgical approaches. Pharmacol ogic therapy should not be the sole focus of pain treatmen t; however, it is the most widely utilized option ( Cohen et al 2016). Major pharmacologic categories used in the management of pain i nclude analgesics. Opioids are available in both short-acting and long-acting or sustained release formulations ( Cohen et al 2016 ). Combining different types of treat ments, including multiple typ es of analgesics, may provide an additive analgesic effect without increasing adverse effects ( Cohen et al 2016, The Medical Letter 2013 ). It is important that patients rece ive appropriate pain treatment with careful consideration of the benefits and risks of treatment options. The use of opioid analgesics presents seriou s risks, including overdose and opioid use disorder. From 1999 to 2014, there were mor e than 165,000 deaths due to o pioid analgesic over doses in the U.S. (Dowell et al 2016 ). The long-acting opioids have gai ned increasing attention regarding overuse, abuse, and diversion. Some manufacturers have addressed concerns about abu se and misuse by developing ne w formulations designed to help discourage the improper use of opioid medications. In January 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) release d draft guidance for in dustry regarding abuse deterrent opioids. This docume nt was finalized in April 2015. T he guidance explains the FDA's current direction regarding studies conducted to demonstrate that a given formulation has abuse deterrent properties. The guidance also makes recommendations a bout how those studies should be pe rformed and evaluated ( FDA Industry Guidance 2015 ). The 2015 guidance does not address generic opioids. Subseque ntly in November 2017, the FDA issued a final guidance to support industry in the development of generic vers ions of abuse-deterrent opioids ( OxyContin (oxycodone) became the first long-acting opioid to be approved with labeling describing the product's abuse det errent properties consistent with the FDA's guidance for industry ( Hale et al 2016 ). Since the approval of reformula ted OxyContin, several other lon g-acting opioids have been approved with abuse deterrent labeling, including, A rymo ER (morphine), et 2016 ). However, Targiniq ER, Troxyca ER, and Vantrela ER were never launched and were recent ly discontinued. Branded Arymo ER was also discontinued by the manufacturer, Egalet ( Drugs@FDA 2019 ). 150 Data as of August 28, 2019 LK-U/MG-U/ALS Page 2 of 16 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. A number of federal agencies have implemented measures to combat drug abuse and misuse. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (C MS) has issued guidance in an effort to improve drug utilizati on review controls in Part D prescription plans. The U.S. O ffice of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion offers an interactive training tool, \"Pathways to Safer Opi oid Use,\" which teac hes healthcare provid ers how to implement opioid-related recommendations from the adverse events action plan. Additionally, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has a number of studies an d initiatives to educate provid ers and patients about opioid addiction and treatment. On July 13, 2017, the National Academi es of Science, Engineeri ng, and Medicine (NASAM) also released a consensus repor t, commissioned by the FDA, whic h outlined the state of t he science regarding prescription opioid abuse and misuse, as well as the evolving r ole that opioids play in pain management ( CMS 2019, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion 20 19, NASAM 2017, NIDA 2015 ). In December 2018, the U.S. Departm ent of Health & Human Service s (HHS) recommended prescribing or co- prescribing naloxone to all patients who are at risk for opioid overdose, including: patients receiving opioids at a dosage of 50 milligram morphine equival ents (MME) per d ay or greater; patients with respiratory con ditions who are prescribed opioids; patients who have been prescribed benzodiazepines alon g with opioids; and patients prescribed opioids who have a non-opioid substance use disorder, report excessive alcohol use, or have a mental health disorder ( HHS 2018 ). In March 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) issued a guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain outside of active cancer treatmen t, palliative car e, and end-of-life care. The guideline addresses when to initiate or continue opioids for chronic pain; opioid selection , dosage, duration, follow- up, and discontinuation; and assessing risks and addressing harms of opi oid use. The guideli ne encourages prescribers to follow best practices for responsible opioid prescribing due to the risks of opioid use ( Dowell et al 2016 ). Methadone is FDA-approv ed for detoxification and maintenance tr eatment of opioid addiction. Methadone products when used for the treatment of opioid addiction in detoxification or maintenance programs, shall be dispensed only by opioid treatment programs (and agencies, p ractitioners or institutions by formal agreement with the program sponsor) certified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Admini stration and approved by the designated state authority. C ertified treatment programs sh all dispense and use methadone in oral form only and according to the treatment requirements stipulated in the Federal Opioid Treatment Standards (42 CFR 8.12) (Prescribing information: Dolophine 2018, methadone oral solution 2019, Methadose 2018 ). Included in this review are the long-acting opioids, which are primarily utilized in the management of moderate to severe chronic pain in patient s requiring a continuous, around-the-clo ck opioid analgesic for an extended period of time. Long- acting opioids are available in a variety of different dosage f orms, and currently several age nts are available generically (Drugs@FDA 2019 ). All of the long-acting opioids a re classified as Schedule II co ntrolled substances by the FD A, with the exception of transdermal and buccal buprenor phine, a partial opioid agonist, which is a Schedule III controlled substance (Drugs@FDA 2019 ). Since some agents are available under multiple brand names, man y tables in this review ar e arranged by generic name. Medispan class: Opioid Agonists Table 1.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY As a class, the long-acting opioi ds are a well-established ther apy for the treatment of m oderate to severe pain. In general, opioids are used for t he treatment of non-cancer and cancer pain; however, dat a establishing their effectiveness in the treatment of neuropathic pain are available. Head-to-head trials of long -acting opioids do exist and for the most part the effectiv eness of the individual agents, i n terms of pain relief, appears to be similar. Small differences between the agents exist in side effect profiles, a nd associated improvements in quality of life or sleep domains ( Agarwal et al 2007, Aiyer et al 2017, Allan et al 2001, Allan et al 2005, Bao et al 2016, Bekkering et al 2011, Bruera et al 2004, Buynak et al 2010, Caldwell et al 2002, Caraceni et al 2011, Chou et al 2015, Clark et al 2004, Conaghan et al 2011, Felden et al 2011, Finkel et al 2005, Finnerup et al 2015, Gimbel et al 2003, Gordon et al [a], 2010, Gordon et al [b], 2010, Karlsson et al 2009, Hale et al 2007, Hale et al 2010, Katz et al 2010, King et al 2011, Kivitz et al 2006, Langford et al 2006, Ma et al 2008, Melilli et al 2014, Mercadan te et al 2010, Mesg arpour et al 2014, Morley et al 2003, Musclow et al 2012, Nicholson et al 2017, Park et al 2011, Pigni et al 2011, Quigley et al 2002, Rauck et al 2014, Schwartz et al 2011, Slatkin et al 2010, Sloan et al 2005, Watson et al 2003, Whittle et al 2011, Wiffen et al 2013, Wild et al 2010 ). Some systematic reviews and meta-analyses recommend opioids as a potential treatment opti on for various forms of non-cancer and cancer-re lated pain; however, other meta-analyses in non-cancer pain have not found a clinically meaningful difference between opioids, other non-opioid pain me dications, and placebo. No single opioid is recommended over the others ( Busse et al 2018, Chou et al 2015, Finnerup et al 2015, Mesgarpour et al 2014, Stewart et al 2018 ). The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) conducted a systematic review (N = 39 studies, 40 publications) of the effectiveness and risks of long-term (>3 m onths) opioid therapy for chronic pain and included both randomized and observational st udies. Findings indicated that t hree randomized, head-to-head trials of various long- acting opioids found no differences in one-year outcomes relate d to pain or function. One good-quality case-control study found current opioid use to be associated with increased risk for hip, humerus, or wr ist fracture versus non-use (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.27 ; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21 to 1.33). The risk was hi ghest with one prescription (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.34 to 3.13) and decreas ed with higher numbe rs of prescriptions, with no increased risk with more than 20 cumulative prescriptions. One fair-quality cohort study found that a cumulative opi oid supply of at least 180 days over a 3.5-year period was associated with an increased ri sk for myocardial infarction versus no long-term opioid therapy (adjusted incide nce rate ratio, 2.66; 95% CI, 2.3 to 3.08) ( Chou et al 2015 ). A systematic review and meta-ana lysis of 96 randomized controll ed trials examined the use of opioids in chronic non- cancer pain. Opioid use was asso ciated with reduced pain compar ed to placebo (weighted mean difference [WMD], -0.69 cm on a 10-cm visual analog -0.82 to -0.56 cm; p < 0.001), as well as improved physical functioning as measured by the 36- item Short Form physical comp onent score (SF-36 PCS; WMD, 2.04 points on a 100-point scale; 95% 1.41 to 2 .68 points; p < 0.001). Howev er, the minimally important d ifference (pain, 1 cm; SF- 36 PCS, 5 points) was not reach ed for either parameter. Opioids were also associated wi th increased vomiting vs placebo (5.9% vs. 2.3%). When opioids were compared to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), similar improvements in pain and physica l functioning were observed (pa in WMD for opioids vs NSAIDs, -0.60 cm; 95% CI, 2018 ). Similarly, another systematic review and meta-analysis of 29 studies found that opioids and other commonly used classes of pain medication produced similar percent reduct ions in osteoarthritis 2018 ). The Special Interest Group on Ne uropathic Pain of the Internati onal Association for the Study of Pain conducted a systematic review and meta-analy sis of randomized, double-blinded studies of oral and topical therapy for neuropathic pain and required a number needed to treat (NNT) for 50% pain relief as the primary measure. For tapentadol ER, the review ident ified one negative study and one positive enrichment study w ith a potential bias and a high NNT of 10.2 (95% CI, 5.3 to 185.5) in 67% o f the patients responding to the open phase. Thirteen trials were identified with strong opioids, i n which oxycodone (10 to 120 mg/day) and morphine (90 to 240 mg/day) were used mainly in peripheral neuropathi c pain. The final quality of evi dence was moderate. Ten trials were positive with a combined NNT of 4.3 (95% CI, 3.4 to 5.8) and a number needed to harm of 11.7 (95% CI, 8.4 to 19.3). Maximum effectiveness seemed to be asso ciated with 180 mg morphine or e quivalent ( Finnerup et al 2015 ). Another systematic review eval uated long-acting opioids in the treatment of moderate to s evere cancer pain. The review included only double-b linded, randomized controlled tria ls for efficacy assessments; open-label and controlled 155 Data as of August 28, 2019 LK-U/MG-U/ALS Page 7 of 16 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

A to tal of five RCTs and four o bservational studies met criteria for inclusion. Similar pain intensity improvements wer e demonstrated for oxycodone ER, oxycodone/naloxone ER, hydromorphone ER, and oxycod one ER. However, the average equivalent dose of oxycodone ER was significantly different from hyd romorphone ER. The Morphine ER and hydromorphone ER groups had similar improvements in average cancer pain in the past 24 hours and \"c urrent pain in the morning; \" however, the \"worst pain in the past 24 hours\" and \"current pain in the evening\" were si gnificantly lower in the hydromorphone ER group. The quality of life scores were comp arable between oxycodone ER and oxycodone/naloxone ER as well as morphine ER and hydromorphone ER in two trials . The rate of discontinuation due to lack of efficacy w as similar among patients treated with morphine ER, hydr omorphone ER, oxycodone ER or oxy codone/naloxone and ranged from 1.1% (oxycodone/naloxone ER) to 6.5% (hydromorphone ER). The risk of experiencing serious adverse events was comparable in patients treated with morphine ER or hydromorphon e ER, morphine ER or fentanyl ER, and morphine ER or oxycodone ER. Ove rall, the reviewers co ncluded that there was no difference in efficacy and risk of harms among ER opioids in the treatmen t of cancer-related pain based on current evidence ( Mesgarpour et al 2014 ). A recent pragmatic, 12-month, randomized trial (N = 240) compar ed opioid vs non-opioid medications on pain-related function, pain intensity, and adv erse effects in patients with moderate to severe chronic back pain or hip or knee osteoarthritis pain despite analgesic use (Krebs et al 2018) . Each intervention had its own pr escribing strategy that include d multiple medication options in 3 steps. In the opioid group, the first step was immedi ate-release morphine, oxycodone , or hydrocodone/acetaminophen. first step was acetam inophen or an NSAID. Medication s were changed, added, or adjusted within the assigned treatment group according to individual patient respon se. Groups did not significantly differ on pain-related function ov er 12 months (p= 0.58); mean 12-month Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) inte rference was 3.4 for the opioid group and 3 .3 for the nonopioid group (difference, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.5 to 0.7). Pain intensity wa s significantly better in the nonopioid group over 12 mont hs (p=0.03); mean 12-month BPI severity was 4.0 for the opi oid group and 3.5 for the nonop ioid group (difference, 0 .5; 95% CI, 0.0 to 1.0). Adverse medication-related sympt oms were significantly more com mon in the opioid group over 12 months (p=0.03); mean medication-related symptoms at 12 months were 1.8 in the o pioid group and 0.9 in the nonopioid group (difference, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.5). Arymo ER and Morphabond were approved based on bioequivalence t o MS Contin. In lieu of conducting new nonclinical studies and clinical studies o f the safety and efficacy, the ma nufacturers relied on previous findings of efficacy and safety for MS Contin ( FDA Summary Review: Arymo ER The efficacy of evaluated in thr ee opioi d-experienced patients with moderate-to-severe chronic lo w back pain. In the trials, the DB treatment phase was preceded by an OL dos e titration period. Patients were eligible for randomization into the 12- week DB treatment phase if they were able to titr ate to a toler able and effective buprenorphine dose. The primary efficacy variable was the patient s' pain scores (based on a 0 t o 10 numeric rating scale). Two of these studies demonstrated efficacy in patient s with low back pain. One trial did not show a statistically s ignificant pain reduction for Belbuca compared to placebo, and the results of this trial are not included in the Prescribing Information ( Belbuca Prescribing Information 2018, Gim bel et al 2016, Rauck et al 2016 ). In one study of opioid- na\u00efve patients, pain scores increased mo re in the placebo group vs. the buprenorphine group during the DB phase; mean (standar d deviation [SD]) changes from baseline to week 12 were 0.94 (1.85) and 1.59 (2.04) in the buprenorphine and placebo groups, respectively, w ith a significant between-g roup difference (-0.67; 95% CI, -1.07 to A higher proportion of bupreno rphine patients (62%) had a t least a 30% reduction in pain score from prior to OL titr ation to study endpoint when compared to patients who re ceived placebo (47%) ( Rauck et al 2016 ). study, opioid-experienc ed patients expe rienced a hig her increase in their pain scores in the placebo vs. buprenorphine group after randomization. The difference between groups in the mean change from baseline to week 12 was -0.98 (95% CI, -1.32 to -0. 64; p < 0.001). A significantly larger percentage of pati ents receiving buprenorphine than placebo had pain reductions 30% and 50% (p < 0.001 for both) ( Gimbel et al 2016 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES Clinical guidelines do not state a preference for the use of on e long-acting opioid over anothe r for the use in moderate to severe pain ( Attal et al 2010, Bril et al 2011, Chou et al 2009, Ho chberg et al 2012, Manchikanti et al 2017, Qaseem 2017, Paice et al 2016, The Medical Letter 2013 ). However, opioid rotation is r ecommended if a patient experie nces 156 Data as of August 28, 2019 LK-U/MG-U/ALS Page 8 of 16 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. adverse effects from one agent ( Chou et al 2009 ). In addition, methadone safety guidelines from the 2014 Ameri can Pain Society recommend buprenor phine as an alternative to methadone for the treatment of opioi d addiction in patients with risk factors or k nown QTc prolongation ( Chou et al 2014 ). In March 2016, the CDC issued a guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. The guideline addresses when to initiate or continue opio ids for chronic pain; opioid selection, dosage, duration, follow-up, and discontinuation; an d assessing risk and addressing harms of opioid use. Recommendations in the CDC gui deline include the following ( Dowell et al 2016 ): Nonpharmacologic therapy and nono pioid pharmacologic therapy ar e preferred for chronic pain. Clinicians should consider opioid therapy only i f expected benefits for both pain and function are anticipat ed to outweigh risks to the patient. If opioids are used, they should be combined with nonp harmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy, as appropriate (c ategory A, evidence 3). Before starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians sho uld establish treatment goals with all patients, including realistic goals for pain and func tion, and should consider how therapy will be disc ontinued if benefit s do not outweigh risks. Clinicians should conti nue opioid therapy only if there is clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function that outweighs risks to patien t safety (category A, evidence 4) . Before starting and periodically during opioid therapy, clinici ans should discuss wi th patients known ri sks and realistic benefits of opioid therapy and patient and clinician responsibilities for managing therapy (category A, evidence 3). When starting opioid therapy fo r chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioids instead of ER/long-acting opioids (category A, evidence 4). Clinicians should prescribe opi oids at the lowest effective dos age. Clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, should ca refully reassess evidence of in dividual benefits and risks when increasing dosage to 50 MME/day, and should avoid increasing dosage to 90 MME/da y or carefully justify a decision to titrate dosage to 90 MME/day (category A, evidence 3). Long-term opioid use often begins with treatment of acute pain. When opioids are used for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effe ctive dose of immediate-release opioids and should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to requi re opioids. Three days or le ss will often be sufficient; more than seven days will rarely be needed (category A, evidenc e 4). Clinicians should evaluate benefits and harms with patients wit hin 1 to 4 weeks of starting opioid therapy for chronic pain or of dose escalation. Clin icians should evaluate benefits and harms of continued therapy with patients every 3 months or more freq uently. If benefits do not outweigh harms of continued opioid therapy, clinicians should optimize other therapies and work with pat ients to taper opioids to lower dosages or to taper and dis continue opioids (category A, evidence 4). Before starting and periodically during continuation of opioid therapy, clinicians should eval uate risk factors for opioid- related harms. Clinicians should incorporate into the managemen t plan strategies to mitigate risk, including considering offering naloxone when factors that increase risk f or opioid overdose, such as h istory of overdose, history of substance use disorder, hi gher dosages ( 50 MME/day) , or concurrent benzodiaz epine use, are present (category A, evidence 4). Clinicians should review the patient's history of controlled su bstance prescriptions using state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data to determine whether the patient is receiving opioid dosages or dangerous combinations that put him or he r at high risk for overdose. Cli nicians should review PDMP data when starting opioid therapy for chronic pain and per iodically during opioid therapy for chronic pain, ranging from every prescription to every 3 months (category A, evidence 4). When prescribing opioids for chr onic pain, clinicians should us e urine drug testing before starting opioid therapy and consider urine drug testing a t least annually to assess for pre scribed medications as well as other controlled prescription drugs and illicit d rugs (category B, evidence 4). Clinicians should avoid prescr ibing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently whenever possible (category A, evidence 3). Clinicians should offer or arrange evidence-based treatment (usually medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine or methadone in combination with behavioral thera pies) for patients with opioi d use disorder (category A, evidence 2). Category of Recommendations : Category A: Applies to all persons ; most patients should receiv e the recommended course of action. Category B: Individual decision making needed; different choice s will be appropriate for differe nt patients. Clinicians help patients arrive at a decisi on consistent with patient valu es and preferences and specific clinical situations. 157 Data as of August 28, 2019 LK-U/MG-U/ALS Page 9 of 16 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Evidence Type : Type 1: Randomized clinical trials or overwhelming evidence fro m observational studies. Type 2: Randomized clinical trials with important limitations, or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies. Type 3: Observational studies or randomized clinical trials wit h notable limitations. Type 4: Clinical experience and observations, observational stu dies with important limitati ons, or randomized clinical trials with several major limitations. In February 2017, the American College of Physicians published clinical practice guidelines for noninvasive treatments of acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain. The guidelines state that clinicians should onl y consider opioids as an option in patients who have fa iled other treatments (e.g., non-pharmacological treatment, NSAI Ds, tramadol, duloxetine) and only if the potentia l benefits outweigh the risks for indiv idual patients and after a discussion of known risks and realistic benefits with patients ( Qaseem et al 2017 ). There is strong opioids (ta pentadol, morphine, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone) are associated with a small short-term improvement in pain scores (about 1 poi nt on a pain scale of 0 to 10) and function compared with placebo. There is moderate-qu ality evidence that show no differences among different long-acting opioids for pain or function, and low-quality evidence shows no clear differences in pain relief between long- and short-acting opioids. In February 2017, the American Society of Interventional Pain P hysicians (ASIPP) also published new practice guidelines for responsible, safe , and effective prescription op ioids for chronic non-cance r pain. Similar to other guidelines, they do not recommend one opioid agent over the oth ers. They do provide the following recommendations and conclusions for long-term opioid therapy ( Manchikanti et al 2017 ): Initiate opioid therapy with low dose, short-acting drugs, with appropriate monitoring (E vidence: Level II; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate). Consider up to 40 MME as low do se, 41 to 90 MME as a moderate dose, and greater t han 91 MME as high dose (Evidence: Level II; Strength o f Recommendation: Moderate). Avoid long-acting opioids for the initiation of opioid therapy (Evidence: Level I; Strength of Recommendation: Strong). Recommend methadone only for use after failure of other opioid therapy and only by clinicians with specific training in its risks and uses, within FDA recommended doses (Evidence: Lev el I; Strength of Recommendation: Strong). Understand and educate patients of the e ffectiveness and advers e consequences (Eviden ce: Level I; Strength Recommendation: Strong). Similar effectiveness for long-acting and short-acting opioids with I-II; Str ength of recommendation: to strong). Recommend long-acting or high dose opioids only in specific circumstances with severe intractable pain (Evidence: Level I; Strength of Recom mendation: Strong). The guidelines from the American College of Physicians and the American Society of Interv entional Pain Physicians state that buprenorphine has lo wer quality evidence and is a th ird-line opioid for the treatment of pain ( Manchikanti et al 2017, Qaseem et al 2017 ). Guidelines from the Society of C ritical Care Medicine do not sp ecifically address the use of long-acting opioids in intensive care unit patients; however, they recommend a multimo dal approach to analgesia, using non-opioid medications as adjunctive therapy in order to decrease opioid u se and optimize pain control ( Devlin et al 2018 ). Similarly, an expert consensus guideline on opioid prescribing in surgical procedures from the American College of Surgeons does not make recommen dations on long-acting opioid us e in this setting, but recommends the maximization of non-opioid analgesia (ie, i buprofen). It also provides recom mendations on the number o f oxycodone 5 mg tablets to prescribe after surgery, dependi ng on the type of surgical proc edure performed ( Overton et al 2018 ). A guideline from the Orthopaedic Trauma Associat ion provides recommendations for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic pain management strategies in acute mu sculoskeletal injury; this gui deline recommends avoiding long-acting opioids in the acute setting (Hsu et al 2019 ). SAFETY SUMMARY On July 9, 2012, the FDA approved a Risk Evaluation and Mitigat ion Strategy (REMS) progra m for ER and long-acting opioids; on September 18, 2018, this REMS was modified to inclu de all immediate-release opioids as well. This program, now known as the Opioid Analgesic REMS program, strong ly encourages healthcare providers to complete an 158 Data as of August 28, 2019 LK-U/MG-U/ALS Page 10 of 16 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The goal of the REMS is to ensure that ben efits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addi ction, abuse, and misuse. All of the long-acting opioids are classified as Schedule II co ntrolled substances by the FD A, with the exception of buprenorphine buccal and transderm al systems, which are Schedul e III controlled substances. Most long-acting opioids are associated with boxed warnings reg arding the potential for abuse and misuse, life- threatening respiratory depressi on, neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, an interaction wi th alcohol, and accidental ingestion risks. Dolophine and methadone products have additional boxed warnings regardin g QT prolongation. Duragesic, Hysingl a ER, OxyContin, X tampza ER, an d Zohydro ER also have a Boxed Warning for an interaction with CYP3A4 inhibit ors (or discontinuation of CYP3A 4 inducers). An additional Box ed Warning for Duragesic cautions against exposure to hea t as it may cause increased fen tanyl release. Key contraindications across the class include acute or severe bronchial asthma, significant r espiratory depression, and known or suspected paralytic ileus. There are multiple w arnings and precautions with each agent. Ke y safety concerns associated with the opioid analgesics include respiratory depression, driving and operatin g int eractions with other CNS depressants, neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, use in special populations, and use in those with gastrointestinal conditions. The frequency of adverse reaction s varies to some degree with e ach agent; however, overall adverse reactions are similar within the class. The m ost common adverse events in adu lts include nausea, vomiting, constipation, and somnolence. OxyContin is approved in patient s aged 11 year s. The most fre quent adverse events in pediatric patients were vomiting, nausea, headache, pyrexia, and constipation. In March 2016, the FDA issued a d rug safety communication warni ng about several safety is sues with opioids and describing new class-wide labeling requirements. The warnings i nclude the following ( FDA Drug Safety Communication 2016 ): Opioids can interact with anti depressants and migraine medications to cause serotonin syndrome. Taking opioids may rarely lead to adrenal insufficiency. Long-term opioid use ma y be associated wit h decreased sex hormone levels and symptoms such as reduced interest in sex, impotence, or infertility. In August 2016, the FD A announced that it i s requiring class-wi de changes to drug labeling, including patient information, in order to help in form health care providers and patients of the serious risks a ssociated with the combined use of certain opioid medications and benzodiazepines ( FDA Drug Safety Communication 2016 ). Among the changes, the FDA is re quiring boxed warnings and pati ent-focused Medication Guides for prescription opioid analgesics, opioid-containing cough products, and benzodiazepines - nearly 400 products in total - with information about the serious ri sks associated with using these medications concomitantly. Risks include extreme sleepiness, respiratory depression, coma, and death. On March 14, 2017, the FDA Drug Safety Risk Management and Anes thetic and Analgesic Dr ug Products Advisory Committees voted 18 to 8, that the benefits of reformulated Opa na ER (which did not originally gain the labeling describing potential abuse deterrent properties) no longer outw eigh its risks. This vote fo llowed an FDA analysis of epidemiological data that indicate d that there was a shift in t he pattern of Opana ER abuse from the nasal to the injection route after the product was reformulated (FDA Advisory Committee 2017). Following the FDA's official withdrawal request, t he manufacturer (Endo) a nnounced the volun tary market withdrawal of reformulated Opana ER (Endo Press Release 2017 ). On September 20, the FDA adv ised clinicians that opioid a ddiction medications, such as methadone and buprenorphine, should not be withheld from patients receiving c oncurrent benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (FDA Drug Safety Communication 2017). Even though combination ther apy with these agents increases the risk of serious side effects, the harm caused by untreated opioid addic tion can outweigh these risks. In April 2019, the FDA issued a dr ug safety communication regarding the risk of serious harm when opioid medications are suddenly discontinued or doses are rapidly decreased in patients who are physically dependent on opioids. Sudden discontinuation or rapid dose redu ction may result in serious w ithdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, psychological distress, and suicide. Opioid m edications should be tapered gra dually according to an individualized schedule if discontinuation or dose reduction is necessary ( FDA Drug Safety Communication 2019 ). 159 Data as of August 28, 2019 LK-U/MG-U/ALS Page 11 of 16 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION Certain strengths are appropriate only for patients who are con sidered treatment-experienced . A detailed description is available within the prescribing information for each agent reg arding when a patient is co nsidered opioid-tolerant, and which strengths are appro priate in these patients. See prescribing information fo r detailed conversion recommendations as there are no esta blished conversions from other opioid agents. When conver ting from one agent to another, it is better to underesti mate need and monitor for breakthrough pain. Table 3. Dosing and Administration Drug Available Formulations Route Usual Recommended Frequency Comments Arymo ER, Avinza*, Kadian, Morphabond, MS Contin (morphine sulfate) and tablets Oral Arymo ER, Morphabond, MS Contin: Every 8 to 12 hours Avinza: Once daily Kadian: Once daily Renal dose adjustment is required. Hepatic dose adjustment is required. Butrans, Belbuca (buprenorphine) Transdermal system (Butrans) Buccal film (Belbuca) Topical Oral Administration every 7 days Every 12 hours Not evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment and should be administered with caution (Butrans). The maximum dose is 900 mcg every 12 hours. Do not exceed this dose due to the potential for QTc interval prolongation. If pain is not adequately managed on a 900 mcg dose, consider an alternate analgesic (Belbuca). For severe hepatic impairment, reduce the starting and incremental dose by half (Belbuca). Dolophine, Methadose (methadone) Oral solution, dispersible tablet, tablets Oral Every 8 to 12 hours (for management of pain) Due to the large variability in half-life (eg, 8 to 59 hours), dose adjustments may vary greatly. Dose increases may be no more frequent than every 3 to 5 days; however, some may require up to 12 days. Due to the metabolism of methadone, patients with liver impairment may be at risk of accumulating methadone after multiple dosing. Duragesic (fentanyl) Transdermal system Topical Administration every 72 hours (Some patients may not achieve adequate analgesia using this dosing interval and may require systems be applied at 48 hours) Avoid use in patients with severe renal impairment. Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 160 Data as of August 28, 2019 LK-U/MG-U/ALS Page 12 of 16 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

CONCLUSION Opioids have been the mainstay of pain treatment for a number o f years, and there is well-do cumented evidence of their effectiveness. Oral morphine is the standard for comparison for all other opioid agents curr ently available. There are 161 Data as of August 28, 2019 LK-U/MG-U/ALS Page 13 of 16 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Levorphanol is indicated for mode rate to severe pain where an opioid analgesic is appropr iate; however, the FDA- approved indication does not stipul ate that patients require ar ound-the-clock, daily dosing for use. Nucynta ER is the only long-acting agent in this class also ind icated for neuropathic pain wh ich requires daily, around- the-clock, long-term opioid treat ment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. OxyContin has been FDA-approved as an option in pediatric patie nts, aged 11 years, for daily, around-the-clock, long term opioid treatment and fo r which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Unlik e adults, pediatric patients must have responded to a minimum opioid daily dose of 20 mg o xycodone for 5 consecutive days prior to initiating treatment with OxyContin. Although study efficacy and safety data are not rigorous, OxyCont in has been prescribed off-label for years within the pediatric population ( FDA Summary: OxyContin 2015 ). All of the long-acting opioids are classified as Schedule II co ntrolled substances by the FD A, with the exception of transdermal and buccal bupreno rphine, which is a Schedule III c ontrolled substance. Since 2013, a number of abuse deterrent form ulations have come to the market. Although various manufacturers have introduced formulations with properties to deter misuse potenti al; there are only a few agent s that have completed studies supporting the potential to deter abuse and misuse. The only long-acting opioids that meet all requirements and are currently available include OxyContin (oxycodone hydrochloride extended release), Embeda release), and Xtampza ER (oxycodone extended release) ( FDA Industry Guidance 2015 ). All long-acting opioids are par t of the Opioid Analgesic REMS p rogram. In general, all of the long-acting opioids are similar in terms of adverse event s, warnings, and contraindications. Methadone-containin g products warn of the potential for QTc prolongation and risks associated with an int eraction with CYP3A4 inhibitors (or discontinuation of CYP3A4 gesic, Hysingla ER, OxyContin, Xtampza ER, and Zohydro ER labeling. The main differences among the individual agents and formulations are du e to dosing requirements a nd generic availability. Several generic tablets and capsules; and oxycodone. Head-to-head trials demonstrate similar efficacy among the agen ts in the class. Systematic reviews and treatment guidelines from several professional organizations support and recommend opioids as a potential treatment option for various forms of non-cancer and cancer-related pain; however, s ome meta-analyses in non- cancer pain have not found a clinically meaningful differenc e between opioids, other non-o pioid pain medications, and placebo. No single opioid is recommended over the others ( Busse et al 2018, Chou et al 2015, Finnerup et al 2015, Mesgarpour et al 2014, Stewart et al 2018 ). Methadone safety guidelines from t he 2014 American Pain Society recommend buprenorphine as an alternative to methadone for the treatment of opi oid addiction in patients with risk factors or known QTc prolongation ( Chou et al 2014 ). Other current clinical guide lines do not state a preference for the use of one long-acting opioid over another for use in moderate to severe pain ( Attal et al 2010, Bril et al 2011, Chou et al 2009, Hochberg et al 2012, Manchikanti et al 2012, Qaseem et al 2017 ). However, opioid rotation is recommended if a patient experie nces adverse effects from one agent (Chou et al 2009 ). A guideline from the CDC has been published that addresses the use of chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care; this guideline emphasizes the use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid therapies when possible, and notes that clinician s should consider opioid therapy only if the expected benefits for both pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient ( Dowell et al 2016).

Therapeutic Class Overview Antiasthmatic - Monoclonal Antibodies INTRODUCTION Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways, making it difficult to breathe. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing, che st tightness, shortness of br eath, and coughing ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2019 ). The exact cause(s) of asthma ar e unknown. A combination of fact ors such as genetics, certa in respiratory infections during childhood, and contact with airborne allergens can contr ibute to its development (CDC 2019 ). The goal of asthma management - asthma control - can be describ ed in the following domains ( National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI] 2007 ): Reduction of impairment Prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms (eg, coughing or breathlessness in the daytime, at night, or after exertion) Require infrequent use ( 2 days a week) of short-acting beta-a gonist (SABA) for quick relief of symptoms Maintain (near) normal pulmonary function Maintain normal activity levels (including exercise and other p hysical activity and att endance at work or school) Meet patients' and families' expectations of and satisfaction with asthma care. Reduction of risk Prevent recurrent exacerbations of asthma and minimize the need for emergency department visits or hospitalizations Prevent progressive loss of lung function; for children, preven t reduced lung growth Provide optimal pharmacotherapy with minimal or no adverse effe cts. Current pharmacologic options for asthma management are categor ized as: (1) long-term control medications to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma, and (2) quic k-relief medications used to treat acute symptoms and exacerbations. Long-term control medications include: Corticosteroids (inhaled corticosteroids [ICS] for long-term co ntrol; short courses of ora l corticosteroids to gain prompt control of disease, long-te rm oral corticosteroids for severe persistent an ronchodilator for th ose not tolerating a SABA SABAs (therapy of choice for relief of acute symptoms and preve ntion of exercise-induced bronchospasm) Systemic corticosteroids (not s te and severe exacerbations) ( NHLBI 2007 ) Approximately 5 to 10% of asthma patients have severe disease. Severe asthma includes various clinical phenotypes of poorly controlled asthma charac terized by frequent use of high- dose ICS and/or oral corticosteroids ( Chung et al 2014 ). While there are currently no wi dely accepted definitions of spe cific asthma phenotypes, sev eral strategies have been proposed to categorize severe asthma phenotypes based on charac teristics such as patie nt age, disease onset, corticosteroid resistance, chr onic airflow obstruction, or type of cellular infiltrate in t he airway lumen or lung tissue (Walford et al 2014 ). The most recent guideline from the Global Initiative for Ast hma (GINA) on severe or difficult-to- treat asthma recommends assessing for Type 2 inflammation throu gh blood and sputum eosinoph il levels, exhaled nitric oxide level and allergic to asthma ( GINA 2019b ) Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CI U), also called chronic urticaria or spontaneous urticaria, i s defined by the presence of hives on most days of the week fo r a period of 6 weeks or longe r, with or without angioedema. The hives are circumscribed, raised, erythemat ous plaques, often with central pallor, and variable in size. N o external allergic cause or contributing disease process can be identified in 80 to 90% of adults and children with CIU ( Khan 2019, Saini 2018 ). 166 Data as of November 6, 2019 RR-U/PH-U/KAL Page 2 of 22 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. CIU affects up to 1% of the general population in the United St ates, and the prevalence is belie ved to be similar in other countries. The condition is mor e common in adults than children and typically begins in the th ird to fifth decades of life. CIU is a self-limited disorder i n most patients although the co ndition generally has a prolong ed duration of 2 to 5 years (Saini 2018 ). Non-sedating H 1-antihistamines are the cornerst one of therapy for CIU. Limited courses of oral glucocorticoids are often used in combination with antihis tamines for refractory symptoms . Other pharmacologic options for patients who do not respond to H 1-antihistamines include the use of H 2-antihistamines, leukotriene sulfasala polyangiitis a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that affect s small-to-medium-sized vessels. It is typically associated wi th eosinophilia and severe asthma ( Groh et al 2015, Padmanabhan et al 2019). EGPA is a rare condition with a p revalence of approximately 13 cases per 1 million persons and an annual incidence of approximately 7 new cases per 1 million persons. It has a highe r incidence in patients with asthma ( Groh et al 2015 ). Systemic glucocorticoids are t he mainstay of treatment for EGPA . For refractory EGPA, the ravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) can be considered (Groh et al 2015). In more than 85% of patients with EGPA, remission can be achiev ed with glucocorticoids with or without an immunosuppressant; how ever, relapses occur in more than 33% ( Pagnoux (AD) is a chr onic inflammatory skin condition characterized by dry skin, e rythema, oozing, crusting, and severe pruritus exacerbated by various environmental stimul i. It is associated with in creased immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and a history of a topy (asthma, allergic rhinitis, or eczema). A genetic defect that leads to dysfunction of the epidermal skin barrier along wit h an impaired immune response t o microbial entry through the epidermis are believed to be the underlying causes of the condition ( Weston and Howe 2019a ). AD affects up to 25% of childr en and 2 to 3% of adults. It can manifest at different sites d epending on the age at onset. The prevalence appears to be incr easing especially in Western s ocieties ( Sidbury et al 2014 , Weston and Howe ). Topical emollients and topical co rticosteroids are first-line t reatments for AD. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are generally reserved as a second-line treatme nt option. The use of systemic therapies is reserved for patients with moderate to severe disease and can include phototherapy, oral cyclosporine, or other systemic immunosuppressants ( Weston and Howe 2019b ). Chronic rhinosinusitis with has a prevalence of approximately 2.7% in adul ts, and peaks in the sixth decade of life. Symptoms include nasal obstruction, reduced sen se of smell, and sleep dis turbance, all of which can substantially impact quality of life. The majority of cases are idiopathic, but may be due to genetic, metabolic, or immunologic causes, resulting in inflammation characterized by eosinophilia and elevated levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (Hopkins 2019) . Common treatment in with mild symptoms, and short-term systemic glucocorticoids, sur gery, and biologic agents in patients with severe symptoms (Hopkins 2019) . This monograph describes the antagonists. The mechanism of action of Fasenra is slightly d ifferent, in that it binds to th e IL-5 receptor on immune effe ctor cells, whereas Cinqair and Nucala bind to the IL-5 cytokine. Eosinophils play a key role in the pathobiology of airway disorders by contributing to inflammation thr ough release of leukotrienes and pro-inflammatory cytokin es. Increases in eosinophils are often correlated with great er asthma severity. IL-5, a cyto kine critical to eosinophil di fferentiation and survival, has been isolated as a potential target in eosinophilic asthma. Nuc ala is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with EGPA. Xolair is a recombinant DNA-der ived monoclonal antibody that se lectively binds to human IgE. Xolair, which reduces the allergic response mediators, is useful in a subset of patie nts with allergic asthma . In addition, Xolair has been shown to improve symptoms in patients with CIU. Dupixent is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits signaling of IL-4 and IL-13. This resu lts in reduction of release of inflammatory mediators includi ng cytokines, chemokines, nitr ic oxide and IgE. These actions are useful for eosinophilic asthma, c ontrolling symptoms of moderate to severe AD, and add-on therapy for inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY OMALIZUMAB Asthma The original Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of oma lizumab was based on the results of 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials conducted in patients 12 years of age with moderate to severe asthma for 1 year and a positive skin test reaction to a pere nnial aeroallergen. All patient s were required to have a baseline IgE between 30 and 700 in ternational unit (IU)/mL and body weight not more than 150 kg. Patients were treated according to a dosing table to adm inister at least 0.016 mg/kg/IU (IgE/mL) of omalizumab or placebo over each 4-week period. Each study was comprised of a run- in period to achieve a stable conversion to a common ICS, followed by randomization to omalizumab or p lacebo. Patients received omali zumab for 16 weeks with an unchanged ICS dose unless an acute exacerbation ne cessitated an increase. Patients then entered an ICS redu ction phase of 12 ( Busse et al 2001, Sol\u00e8r et al 2001 ) and 16 weeks ( Holgate et al 2004 ) during which ICS dose redu ction was attempted in a stepwise manner. In the 28-week study by Busse e t al (N = 525), during the steroid stable phase, patients treated with omalizumab had fewer mean exacerbations/subject ( 0.28 vs 0.54; p = 0.006) and decreased mean duration of exacerbations (7.8 vs 12.7 days; p < 0.001) compared with placebo-treated patients. Similarly, during the ster oid reduction phase, omalizumab was associated with fe wer exacerbations/subject (0.39 vs 0.66; p = 0.003), and a shorter mean duration of exacerbations (9.4 vs 12.6 days; p = 0.021) ( Busse et al 2001 ). In the 28-week study by Sol\u00e8r e t al (N = 546), asthma exacerbat ions/patient, the primary endpoint, decreased more in the omalizumab group compared to placebo during both the stable steroid (0.28 vs 0.66; p < 0.001) and steroid reduction phases (0.36 vs 0.75; p < 0.001) ( Sol\u00e8r et al 2001 ). 169 Data as of November 6, 2019 RR-U/PH-U/KAL Page 5 of 22 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. In the 32-week study by Holgate et al (N = 246), the percentage reduction in ICS dose, the primary endpoint, was greater among patients treated with omalizumab than among patie nts treated with placebo (median, 60 vs 50%; p = 0.003). The percentages of patients with 1 asthma exacerbatio n were similar between omalizumab and placebo groups during both the stable s teroid and steroid reduction pha ses (p value not reported). The absence of an observed treatment effect may be related to differences in the patient population compared with the first 2 studies, study sample size, o r other factors ( Holgate et al 2004). A meta-analysis of 3 of the pr eviously mentioned trials ( Busse et al 2001, Holgate et al 2004, Sol\u00e8r et al 2001 ) and their extension studies assessed the efficacy of omalizumab in a subg roup of 254 patients at high risk of serious asthma- related mortality and morbidity. P atients were defined as high-risk due to asthma histories that included the following: intubation history, emergency r oom visit within the last year, overnight hospitalization, or intensive care unit treatment. The primary outcome was an annua lized rate of acute exacerbatio n episodes based on data fr om the initial 16-week stable steroid phase for high-risk patients. Two kinds of acute exacerbation episodes were considered as endpoints: significant acute exacerbation episodes and all acute exacerbation episodes (ie, all episodes recorded by the investigator). Significant acute exacerbation episodes were def ined as those requiring a do ubling of baseline ICS dose (Busse et al 2001, Sol\u00e8r et al 2001 ) or use of systemic steroids ( all 3 studies). During the stabl e steroid phase, mean significant acute exacerbation episode rates were 1.56 and 0.69 /patient-year, respectively, a reduction of 56% with omalizumab (p = 0.007). Similar reductions in exacerbations in favor of omalizumab were obs erved for the whole study period and for all acute exacerbat ion episodes. The authors con cluded that 113 significant acute exacerbation episodes were prevented for every 100 pat ients treated with omalizumab for 1 year ( Holgate et al 2001). A Cochrane Review conducted in 2014 evaluated the efficacy of o malizumab in patients with a llergic asthma. Treatment with omalizumab was associated w ith a significant reduction in the odds of a patient having an asthma exacerbation (odds particip ants). This represents an absolute reduction from 26% for participants suffering an exacerbation on placebo to 16% on omalizumab, over 16 to 60 weeks. Additionally, in patients with moderate to severe asthma and in those who were r eceiving background ICS therapy, treatment with omalizumab resulted in a significant re duction in the odds of havi ng an asthma exacerbation (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0 .42 to 0.6; 7 studies; 1889 participants). A significant benefit was noted for subcutaneous (SC) omalizumab vs placebo with regard to redu 0.16, 95% CI, studies; 1824 participants), representing an abso lute reduction in risk from 3% with placebo to 0.5% with omalizumab over 28 to 60 weeks. The authors concluded tha t omalizumab was effective in r educing asthma exacerbations and hospitalizations as an adjunctive therapy to ICS and si gnificantly more effective t han placebo in increasing the numbers of participants who were able to reduce or withdraw their ICS. Omalizumab was gener ally well tolerated, although there were more injection site reactions with omalizumab. However, the clinical value of the reduction in steroid consu mption has to be considered in light of the high cost of omalizumab ( Normansell et al 2014 ). A systematic review of 8 random ized, placebo-controlled trials (N = 3429) evaluated the efficacy and safety of SC omalizumab as add-on therapy to corticosteroids in children and adults with moderate to severe allergic asthma. At the end of the steroid reduction phase, patients taking omalizumab were more likely to be able to withdraw corticosteroids completely compared with placebo (relative risk [RR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.42 to 2.28; p = 0.000 01). Omalizumab patients showed a decreased risk for asth ma exacerbations at the end of the stable (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0 .48 to 0.66; p = 0.0001) adjustable-steroid phases (RR, 0.47 to 0.64; p = 0.0001); post-hoc analysis suggests this effect was independent of duration of treatment, age, severity of asthma, and risk of bias. The frequency of serious adverse effects was similar between omalizumab (3.8%) and placebo (5.3%). Howev er, injection site reactions were more frequent in the omalizumab patient s (19.9 vs 13.2%). Omalizumab was not ass ociated with an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, cardiovascular effects, or malignant neoplasms ( Rodrigo et al 2011 ). In July 2016, the FDA expanded the indication of omalizumab to patients 6 to 11 years of a ge with moderate to severe persistent asthma. The approval was based primarily on a 52-wee k, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. The study evaluated the safety and efficacy of omalizumab as add-on ther apy in 628 pediatric patients 6 to < 12 years of age with moderate to severe asthma inadequately controlled despite the use of an ICS ( Lanier et al 2009 ). Over the 24-week fixed-steroid phase, omalizumab reduced the ra te of clinically signific ant asthma exacerbations (worsening symptoms requiring doubling of baseline ICS dose and /or systemic steroids) by 31% vs placebo (0.45 vs 0.64; RR, 0.69; p = 0.007). Ove r a period of 52 weeks, the exac erbation rate was reduced by 43% (p < 0.001). Other efficacy variables such as noc turnal symptom scores, beta-agoni st use, and forced expirat ory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) were not significantly differ ent in omalizumab-treated patien ts compared to placebo. 170 Data as of November 6, 2019 RR-U/PH-U/KAL Page 6 of 22 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

A 2017 systematic review of 3 randomized, placebo-controlled tr ials and 5 observational st udies evaluated the safety and efficacy of omalizumab in children and adolescents. Omalizu mab reduced exacerbations compared with placebo or baseline in all studies that included this outcome. The randomized controlled trials did not identify significant differences in FEV 1; however, 3 of the 4 observational studies that included this outcome did find significant FEV 1 improvement with omalizumab. Generally, ICS and resc ue medication use were reduc ed with omalizumab in the studies. The authors concluded that the evidence strongly supports omalizumab safety and efficacy in pati ents 6 to 11 years (Corren et al 2017) . The EXCELS study was a multicent er, observational cohort study to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and long-term safety of omalizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe allerg ic asthma. Patients were eva luated as part of 3 groups: non-omalizumab users, those newl y starting omalizumab, and thos e who were established user s at study initiation. Interim efficacy results demons trated that at month 24, the ACT score increased in all 3 pat ient groups: from 18.4 to 20 in non-omalizumab users, from 1 5.2 to 19.4 in those newly st arting on omalizumab, and from 18.2 to 19.4 in established omalizumab users. For patients newly starting omali zumab treatment, 54% achieved at least a minimally important difference, defined as a 3 point increase from base line in ACT. The study demonstrated that established users of omalizumab maintained asthma control during the study period ( Eisner et al 2012 ). To investigate the relationship between omalizumab and malignan t neoplasms, safety infor mation from the EXCELS trial was analyzed. Similar rates of primary malignancies in om alizumab- and non-omalizum ab-treated patients were found. However, study limitations preclude definitively ruling out a malignancy risk with omalizumab (Long et al 2014 ). A higher incidence of overall card iovascular and cerebrovascular serious adverse ev ents was observed in omalizumab-treated patients comp patients ( Iribarren et al 2017 ). To further evaluate the risk, a pooled analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials was conducted. An increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular serious adverse events was not noted, but the l ow number of events, the yo ung patient population, and the short duration of follow- up prevent a definite conclusi on about the absence of a risk ( FDA 2014 ). Patients from the EXCELS study w ere eligible for the XPORT tria l, a 52-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the persistence of res ponse to omalizumab in patient s who discontinued omaliz umab therapy after long- term use. Patients were randomized to continue their omalizumab therapy or to omalizumab discontinuation. More patients who continued omalizum ab did not have an exacerbation compared to those who discontinued therapy (67.0% vs 47.7%; absolute differe nce, 19.3%; 95% CI, 5.0 to 33. 6). The authors concluded that continuation of omalizumab after long-term use results in sustained benefit (Ledford et al 2017) . Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria The safety and efficacy of omalizumab for the treatment of CIU was assessed in 2 placebo-controlled, multiple-dose clinical studies. Patients received omalizumab 75, 150, or 300 mg or placebo by SC injection every 4 weeks in addition to their baseline level of H 1 antihistamine therapy for 24 or 12 weeks, followed by a 16-wee k washout observation period. In both studies, patient s who received omalizumab 150 m g or 300 mg had greater decreases from baseline in weekly itch severity scores and weekly hive count scores than placebo at week 12. The 75 mg dose did not demonstrate consistent evidence of efficacy and is not approved for use ( Kaplan et al 2013, Maurer et al 2013 eval uated omalizumab add-on for 24 weeks in patients with CIU who remai ned symptomatic despite H 1 antihistamine therapy. Similar to previous studies, patients treated with omalizumab had signif icantly greater reductions in weekly itch severity score from baseline to week 12 compared to placebo (p 0.001) (Saini et al 2015 ). A meta-analysis of randomized ical trials evaluating omalizumab for the treatment of CIU was published in 2016. The analysis included 7 randomized, p lacebo-controlled studies with 1312 patients with CIU. Patients treated with omalizumab (75 to 600 mg every 4 weeks) had significantly reduc ed weekly itch and weekly wheal scores compared with the placebo group. The effects of omalizumab were dose dep endent, with the strongest reduction in weekly itch and weekly wheal scores observed with 300 mg. Rates of complete response were significantly higher in the omalizumab group (p < 0.00001) a nd dose dependen t, with the hig hest rates in the 300 mg g roup. Rates of patients with adverse events were similar in the omalizumab and placebo groups ( Zhao et al 2016 ). Similar results were identified in a 2019 meta-analysis of 6 trials comparing omaliz umab with placebo (Rubini et al 2019) . A Phase 4 randomized clinical tria l evaluated the effect of oma lizumab in 205 patients with antihistamine-resistant CIU/chronic spontaneous urticari a. After an initial 24-week per iod of open-label treatment with omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks, patients randomiz ed to continue omalizumab for a nother 24 weeks of double-blind therapy experienced a significantly lower rate of c linical worsening compared with patients randomized to double- blind placebo (21.0% vs 171 Data as of November 6, 2019 RR-U/PH-U/KAL Page 7 of 22 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

No new safety signals were detected over th e 48-week omalizumab treatment period (Maurer et al 2018) . BENRALIZUMAB Asthma The safety and efficacy of benra lizumab were evaluated in a 52- week dose-ranging exacerbation trial, 3 confirmatory trials, and a 12-week lung function trial ( Bleecker et al 2016, Castro et al 2014, Fe rguson et al 2017, Fitzgerald et al 2016, Nair et 2017 ). In a randomized, controlled, doubl e-blind, dose-ranging Phase 2 b study, 324 adults with un controlled eosinophilic asthma were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 80), benralizumab 2 mg (n = 81), benralizumab 20 mg (n = 81), or benralizumab 100 mg (n = 82) and 285 adults with non-eosinophil ic asthma were randomized to benralizumab 100 mg (n = 142) or placebo (n = 143) ( Castro et al 2014 ). Treatments were given as 2 S C injections every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, then every 8 weeks, for 1 year. Among adults with eosinophilic asthma, benralizumab 100 mg reduced exacerbation rates as com pared to placebo (0.34 vs 0.57 ; rate reduction, 41%; 80% C I, 11 to 60; p = 0.096). A significant reduction in exace rbation rates was not seen with benralizumab 2 mg or 20 mg as compared to placebo in these patients. In patients with a baseline blood eosinophil count of 300 cells/\u00b5L, exacerbation rates were lower than in the placebo group for the benralizumab 20 mg (0.30 vs 0 .68; rate reduction, 57%; 80% CI, 33 to 72; p = 0.015) and 100 mg (0.38 vs 0. 68; rate reduction, 43%; 80% CI, 18 to 60 ; p = 0.049) groups. SIROCCO was a randomized, multi center, double-blind, placebo-co ntrolled, 48-week, Phase 3 trial (N = 1205) involving patients with severe asthma with eosinophilia uncontr olled with high-do se ICS and LABAs ( Bleecker et al 2016 ). Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 407 ), benralizumab 30 mg every 4 weeks (n = 400), or benralizumab 30 mg every 8 w eeks (n = 398). Compared with pl acebo, benralizumab reduced the annual asthma exacerbation rate over 48 weeks w hen administered every 4 weeks (RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.71; p < 0.0001) or every 8 weeks (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.64; p < 0.0001). Bot h doses of benralizumab also significantly improved pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 in patients at week 48 vs place bo. Asthma symptoms were improv ed with benralizumab every 8 weeks, but not every 4 weeks, as compared to placebo. CALIMA was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-con as add-on therapy (to high-do se ICS and LABA) for patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma and elevated blood eos inophil counts ( Fitzgerald et al 2016 ). A total of 1306 patients were randomly assigned to benralizumab 30 mg every 4 wee ks (n = 425), benralizumab 30 mg every 8 weeks (n = 441 ) or placebo (n = 440). When compared to placebo, significant reductions in annual exac erbation rates were seen with benralizumab every 4 weeks (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.85; p = 0.0018) and every 8 weeks (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.95; p = 0.0188). Benralizumab was also associated with significantly improved pr e-bronchodilator FEV 1 and total asthma symptom scores vs placebo. Patients enrolled in the SIROCCO and CALIMA trials who complete d treatment were eligible for the BORO Phase 3 safety extension trial. This was a randomized, double-blind stu dy that randomized patients to received benralizumab 30 mg every 4 or 8 weeks. Adult patients received treatment for 52 weeks and adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) were treated for 108 weeks. A total of 1576 patients were inclu ded in the full-analysis set w ith safety assessed at 56 weeks. Treatment discontinuation due to any adverse event occurred in approximately 2% of patients in each group. The most common adverse events were viral upper respiratory tra ct infections and worsening asthma. Serious adverse events included worsening asthma (3% in the every-8-wee k dosing group and 4% i n the every-4-week dosing group), pneumonia (< 1% in both groups) and pneumonia ca used by bacterial infection (< 1% in the every-4- week dosing group and 1% in the every-8-week dosing group). New malignancy occurred in 12 (1%) of the 1,576 patients. Hypersensitivity rela ted to treatment occurred in 3 p atients. For the secondary e fficacy outcome, patients with elevated blood eosinophil levels had similar exacerbation rates to that observed durin g the first year of treatment in the SIROCCO and CALIMA trials ( Busse et Phase 3 trial that evaluated benralizumab therapy for patients with mild to moderate persist ent asthma ( Ferguson et al 2017 ). Patients (N = 211) had been receiving either low- to medium-dose ICS or low-dose ICS plus LABA therapy and were randomized to benralizumab 30 mg every 4 weeks (n = 106) or placebo (n = 105). Benralizumab resulted in an 80 mL (95% CI, 0 to 150; p = 0.04) greater improvem ent in pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 after 12 weeks as compared to placebo. Despite this improvement, this lung function re sult does not w arrant the use of benralizumab in mild to moderate asthma because it did not reach the minimum clin ically important improvement o f 10%. 172 Data as of November 6, 2019 RR-U/PH-U/KAL Page 8 of 22 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

ZONDA was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-cont rolled, 28-week trial t hat primarily assessed whether or not benralizumab was effective as an oral glucocorticoid-sparing therapy in pat ients on oral steroids to manage severe asthma asso ciated with eosinophilia (Nair et al 2017 ). Of the enrolled patients, 220 were randomly assigned to benralizumab 30 mg every 4 weeks (n = 72), benraliz umab 30 mg every 8 weeks (n = 73), or placebo (n = 75). Results revealed that t he 2 benralizumab dosing regimens significantly reduced the median final oral glucocorticoid doses from basel ine by 75% vs a 25% reduction se en with placebo (p < 0.001 for both comparisons). Additionally, benralizumab adminis tered every 4 weeks resulted in an annual exacerbation rate that was 55% lower than that seen with placebo (marg inal rate, 0.83 vs 1.83; p = 0 .003) and benralizumab administered every 8 weeks resulted in a 70% lower rate than that seen with placebo (margi nal rate, 0.54 to 1 .83; p < 0.001). Fitzgerald et al conducted a st udy exploring the efficacy of be nralizumab for patients with different baseline blood eosinophil thresholds and exacer bation histories. This study wa s a pooled analysis (n = 2295 patients) of the results from the SIROCCO and CALIMA phase 3 studies. The annual exacerb ation rate among patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts of 0 cells/L was 1.16 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.2 8) in patients who received pl acebo vs 0.75 (0.66 to 0.84) in patients who received benralizumab every 8 weeks (RR, 0.64; 0.55 to 0.75; p < 0.0001). In patients who received benralizumab every 4 weeks who h ad eosinophil counts of 0 cells/L, the annual exacerbati on rate was 0.73 (0.65 to 0.82); RR vs placebo wa s 0.63 (0.54 to 0.74; p < 0.0001). The extent to which exacerbation rates were reduced increased with increasing blood eosinophil thresholds and with greater exacerbation history in patients in the every-4- week and every-8-week benralizumab groups. Greater improvements in the annual exacerbation rate were seen with benralizumab compared with place bo for patients with a combinat ion of high blood eosinophil thresholds and a history of more frequent exacerbations (FitzGerald et al 2018). A 2017 meta-analysis evaluated t he therapeutic efficacy and saf ety of benralizumab in pat ients with eosinophilic asthma. A total of 7 articles (n = 2321) met the inclusion crit eria of the systematic revie w. The pooled analysis found that benralizumab significantly reduced exacerbations (RR, 0.63 ; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.76; p < 0.00001) compared to placebo. There was no statistica l trend for improvement in FEV 1 or asthma control indices such as Quality of Life Assessment (AQLQ) and Asthma Cont rol Questionnaire score in ben ralizumab-treated patients . In addition, safety data indicated that benralizumab admin istration resulted no increasi ng incidence of adverse ev ents and was well tolerated (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.05; p = 0.96) (Tien et al 2017) . MEPOLIZUMAB Asthma The safety and efficacy of were evaluated in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized controlled trials in adolescen t and adult patients with severe refractory asthma and signs of eosinophilic inflammation. Generally, patients were eligible for enrollment in the trials if they had eosinophils 150 ce lls/L in the peripheral blood at screening or 300 cells/L a t some time during the previous year. Patients also were re quired to be on a high-dose ICS as well as another controller medication ( Bel et al 2014, Ortega et al 2014, Pavord et al 2012 ). DREAM was a dose-ranging, 52-we ek, Phase 2b/3 study (N = 621) t hat compared annual asthma exacerbation frequency and improvements in c linical symptoms between patient s receiving 75 mg , 250 mg, and 750 mg intravenous (IV) mepolizumab and placebo . Mepolizumab decreased clinically significant exacerbation rates across all doses compared to placebo, at a rate of 2.40 per patient per year in the placebo group, 1.24 in the 75 mg mepolizumab group (p < 0.0001), 1.46 in the 250 mg mepolizumab group (p = 0.0005), and 1.15 in the 750 mg mepolizumab group (p < 0.0001). No significant improvements wer e found for secondary clinical symptom measures, which included change in pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 from baseline, or change in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores (Pavord et al 2012) . MENSA was a 32-week Phase 3 trial (N = 576) that compared annua l asthma exacerbation frequency and improvements in clinical symptom s between patients receiving SC and IV mepolizumab vs placebo. Patients were selected on the basis of frequent exacerbat ions, treatment with high doses of ICS, and a defined blood eosinophil count. Both SC and IV mepolizumab significantly decreased clini cally significant exacerbation rates compared to placebo, at a rate of 1.74 per pat ient per year in the placebo group, 0.93 per patient per y ear in the IV mepolizumab group (p < 0.001), and 0.83 per patient per year in the SC mepo lizumab group (p < 0.001 ). In both the SC and IV mepolizumab-treated groups, the ACQ scores met thresholds for m inimal clinically important change and were significantly improved compared to placebo (p < 0.001) (Ortega et al 2014) . SIRIUS was a 24-week Phase 3 tria l (N = 135) that compared oral corticosteroid require ments between patients receiving SC mepolizumab and placebo . The likelihood of a reduction in the daily oral glucocorticoid dose was 2.39 times higher in the mepolizumab group (95% CI, 1.25 to 4.56; p = 0.008). The median redu ction in daily oral 173 Data as of November 6, 2019 RR-U/PH-U/KAL Page 9 of 22 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

A post-hoc analysis of data from DREAM and MENSA was conducted to assess the relationship between baseline blood eosinophil counts and efficacy of mepolizumab. Of 1192 pa tients, 846 received mepol izumab and 346 received placebo. The overall rate of mean exacerbations per person per year was reduced from 1. 91 with placebo to 1.01 with mepolizumab (47% reduction; RR, 0.53; 95% < 0.0001). The exacerbation rate reduction with mepolizumab vs placebo increased progressively from 52% (R R, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.58) in patients with a baseline blood eosinophil coun t of 150 cells/L to 70% (RR, 0 .30; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.40) i n patients with a baseline count of 500 cells/L. At a baseline count < 150 cells/L, pr edicted efficacy of mepolizumab was reduced. The authors concluded that the use of a bas eline blood eosinophil count wil l help to select patients who are likely to achieve important asthma outcomes with mepolizumab ( Ortega et al 2016 ). COSMOS was a 52-week, open-label extension study in patients wh o received mepolizumab or placebo in MENSA or SIRIUS. Patients received SC m epolizumab regardless of prior treatment allocation and continued to receive appropriate standa rd-of-care asthma th erapy throughout. In tota l, 558 previous mepolizumab: placebo: 94 (14%; previous p lacebo: 36) patients ex perienced on-treatment adverse events and seri ous adverse events, respectively. No fat al adverse events or instances of mepolizumab-related anaphylaxis were reported. Mepo lizumab treatment was shown to exert a durable response, with patients who previously received mepolizumab i n MENSA or SIRIUS maintaining reductions in exacerbation rate and oral corticosteroid dosing throughout C OSMOS. Patients who previousl y received placebo in MENSA or SIRIUS demonstrated improvements in these endpoints following treatmen with mepolizumab ( Lugogo et al 2016 ). COLUMBA was an open-label extension study of patients enrolled in the DREAM trial who received mepolizumab 100 mg every 4 weeks plus standard of care until criterion for disc ontinuation was met (safety prof ile not positive for patient, patient withdrawn by their physi cian, patient withdrew consent, or drug became commercially available). There were 347 patients enrolled who receiv ed treatment for a mean of 3.5 years. Adverse events mos t frequently reported were respiratory tract infection (67%), headache (29%), bronchitis ( 21%), and worsening asthma (27%). Although 6 deaths occurred, none were considered related to study treatment. No a naphylaxis reactions were reported. Malignancy was reported in 2% (n = 6) of patients. The exacerbation rate for patients on treatment for 156 weeks or longer was 0.74 events/year, which was a 56% red uction from the off-treatment p eriod between the 2 studies ( Khatri et al 2018 ). A pharmacokinetic study of SC m epolizumab 40 and 100 mg (for bodyweight < 40 and 40 kg, respectively) every 4 weeks in 36 children 6 to 11 years of age with severe eosinophi lic asthma and 2 exacerbations in the prior year demonstrated reductions in blood eosinophil count by 89% at wee k 12 (Gupta et al 2019a) . A 52-week safety extension study of 30 children demonstrate d no safety or immunogenicity c oncerns, as well as improvements in blood eosinophil counts and asthma control from baseline (Gupta et al 2019b) . Findings of these studies s upported FDA approval of mepolizumab for treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma in chil dren ( GlaxoSmithKline 2019 ). A systematic review and meta-ana lysis compared hospitalization or hospitalization and/or emergency room visit rates in patients with severe eosinoph ilic asthma treated with mepolizum ab or placebo in addition to standard of care for 24 weeks. Four studies (N = 1388) were eligible for inclusion. Mepolizumab significantly reduced the rate of exacerbations requiring hospital ization (relative rate, 0.49; 9 5% CI, 0.30 to 0.80; p = 0.004) and hospitalization/emergency room vis it (relative rate, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.73; p < 0.001 ) vs placebo. Significant reductions of 45% and 38% were a lso observed for the proportion of patients experiencing 1 or more hospitalization and hospitalization and/or emergency room vi sit, respectively ( Yancey et the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab as add-on therapy (to glucoc orticoid treatment, with or without immunosuppressive therapy) for patients with rel apsing or refractory EGPA ( Wechsler et al 2017 ). A total of 136 patients were randomly assigned to mepolizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks (n = 68) or placeb o (n = 68). Results demon strated the following for the mepolizumab and placebo groups, respectively: Percentage of patients with 24 weeks of accrued remission: 28 % vs 3% (OR, 5.91; 95% CI, 2.68 to 13.03; p < 0.001). Percentage of patients in remis sion at both week 36 and week 48 : 32% vs 3% (OR, 16.74; 95% CI, 3.61 to 77.56; p < 0.001). Annualized relapse rate: 1.14 vs 2 .27 (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.36 t o 0.70; p < 0.001). 174 Data as of November 6, 2019 RR-U/PH-U/KAL Page 10 of 22 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Percentage of patients able to r educe their daily dose of conco mitant prednisone or prednisolone to 4 mg or less (average of weeks 48 to 52): 44% vs 7% (OR, p < RESLIZUMAB Asthma The safety and efficacy of resli evaluated in 4 doubl e-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized controlled trials. In all 4 studies , patients were required to be on at least a medium-dose ICS with or without additional controller medications ( Bjermer et al 2016, Castro et al 2015, Corren et al 2016). Studies 3082 and 3083 were 52-week studies (N = 953) in patient s with asthma who were required to have a blood eosinophil count 400 cells/L, and 1 asthma exacerbation re quiring systemic corticost eroid use over the past 12 months. These studies compared t he asthma exacerbation rate and improvements in clinical symptoms between patients receiving reslizumab 3 mg/kg IV administered once ever y 4 weeks and placebo. In b oth studies, patients receiving reslizumab had a significant reduction in the frequency of asthma exacerbations (Study 3082: RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.67; 3083: RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.5 9; both p < 0.0001) compared with those receiving placebo. In both trials, an improvement in FEV 1 was evident for reslizumab vs placebo by the first on-treatmen t assessment at week 4, which was sustained through week 52. Resl izumab treatment also resulted in significant improvements compared with placebo in AQLQ total score, ACQ-7 s core, and Asthma Symptom Utility Index (ASUI) score ( Castro et al 2015 ). Study 3081 was a 16-wee k study (N = 315) in patients who were r equired to have a blood eosinophil count 400 cells/L. The study compared the change from baseline in FEV 1 and improvements in clinical symptoms between reslizumab 3 mg/kg vs placebo. Reslizumab 3 mg/kg significantly improved FEV 1 (difference vs placebo: 160 mL; 95% CI, 60 to 259; p = 0.0018). Res lizumab also statistically s ignificantly improved ACQ and AQLQ; however, the minimally important difference was only reached for AQLQ (Bjermer et al 2016 ). Study 3084 was a 16-week study in 496 patient s unselected for baseline blood eosinophil levels (approximately 80% of patients had a screening blood eosinophil count < 400 ce lls/L). Patients were not allowed to be on maintenance oral corticosteroi ds. The study compared the change from baseline in FEV 1 and improvements in clinical symptoms between resliz umab 3 mg/kg vs placebo. In the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophils < 400 cells/L, patients treated wi th reslizumab showed no significant improvement in FEV 1 compared with placebo. In the subgroup with eosinophils 400 cells/L, however, treat ment with reslizumab was associated with much larger improvements in FEV 1, ACQ, and rescue SABA use compared with placebo ( Corren et al 2016 ). An open-label, non-randomized ex tension study of these placebo- controlled trials continued treatment of patients with eosinophilic asthma with reslizum ab 3 mg/kg every 4 weeks for u p to 24 months to assess the drug's safety. Patients initially randomized to placebo al so received active drug. A to tal of 1051 patients were inc luded (n = 480 reslizumab- naive and n = 571 reslizumab-tr eated patients). Of these, 740 p atients received treatment for 12 months or longer and 249 patients received treatment fo r 24 months or longer. Worsen ing asthma and nasopharyngitis were the most common adverse events. Serious adv erse events occurred in 7% of patients and treatment discontinuation due to an adverse event occurred in 2% of patients. No deaths (n = 3) wer e related to treatment. Malignancy occurred in 15 (1%) patients. Patients previous ly on reslizumab maintained ast hma control and those naive to treatment demonstrated improvement in asthma control and lung function. T he authors concluded that reslizumab maintained asthma control for up to 2 years in patients with moderate-to-s evere eosinophilic asthma ( Murphy et al 2017 ). A post hoc analysis of pooled data from 2 randomized, placebo-c ontrolled trials in patients with inadequately controlled asthma and elevated blood eosinophil levels compared the efficacy of reslizumab vs placebo among the subgroup of patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. Reslizumab was associated with a significant improvement in overall asthma e xacerbations (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.18 of 5 randomized controlled trials comparin g reslizumab to placebo (N = 1366) revealed improvements in exacerbations, FEV 1, and ACQ score with reslizumab. A sthma exacerbations occurred less frequently in reslizumab patients vs place bo (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.59; p < 0.00001). FEV 1 also improved with reslizumab compared to placebo (mean difference, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.2 3; p < 0.00001). Finally, ACQ score improved with reslizumab compared to placebo (mean difference, -0.26; 95% CI, -0.36 to -0.16; p < 0.0000 1). All studies included in the meta-analysis were of limit ed duration of 15 or 16 weeks ( Li et al 2017 ). A 2019 meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials (5 place bo-controlled trials and 1 open-label extension) evaluated the safety of reslizumab (n = 1028) with placebo (n = 730) in adults with uncontro lled asthma. Compared with placebo, reslizumab was associat ed with lower proportions of pa tients with 1 adverse event (67% vs 81%; RR, 0.83; 175 Data as of November 6, 2019 RR-U/PH-U/KAL Page 11 of 22 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

DUPILUMAB AD The efficacy and safety of dupilumab compared to placebo in adu lts with moderate-to-sever e AD was evaluated in two Phase 3 trials, SOLO 1 (n = 671) and SOLO 2 (n = 708). Adults w ho did not have an adequate response to topical treatments were included. Patients were randomized to either pl acebo, dupilumab 300 mg SC weekly or every other week for 16 weeks. The proportion of patients with an Investiga tor's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 (indicating clear or almost clear skin) and a reduction of 2 points or more in the score from baseline at week 16 was the primary outcome. In both studies between 36% and 38% of p atients who re ceived either regimen o f dupilumab achieved the primary outcome compared to 8% to 10% of patients who received placebo (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Significantly more patients who re ceived dupilumab had 75% improvement from baseline on the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) compared to those who received placebo (p < 0.001). P ruritus and quality of life measures were also significantly improved with dup ilumab. The most common adverse effects with dupilumab compared to placebo were conjunctivitis and injection-site reactions ( Simpson et al 2016). The long-term efficacy and safet y of dupilumab was compared to placebo in 740 patients wi th moderate to severe AD not adequately controlled with topi cal corticosteroids in the L IBERTY AD CHRONOS study. P atients received either dupilumab 300 mg once weekly, onc e every 2 weeks, or placebo fo r 52 weeks. The co-pri mary endpoints were proportion of patients achieving an IGA score of 0 or 1 and 2 point improvement from baseline and EASI-75 at week 16. At week 16, 39% of patients in both dupilumab groups achiev ed an IGA score of 0 or 1 co mpared to 12% of patients who received placebo. EASI-75 was achieved in 64% and 69% of th e dupilumab groups vs 23% i n the placebo group (p < 0.0001). Similar efficacy resul ts were reported at week 52. A t 1 year, the most common ad verse events associated with dupilumab were injection-si te reactions and conjunctivitis . Localized herpes while herpes zoster and eczema herpeticum was more common the placebo group ( Blauvelt et al 2017 ). The efficacy of dupilumab compared to placebo was evaluated in 251 patients 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to- severe AD in a double-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Patients < 60 kg received dupilumab 400 mg initially then 200 mg every 2 wee ks and patients 60 kg receiv ed 600 mg initially then 300 mg every 2 weeks for 16 weeks. Compared with placebo, dupilumab resulted in significant ly higher proportions of pat ients achieving EASI-75 at week 16 (41.5% vs 8. 2%; p < 0.001) and IGA score of 0 or 1 with 2 or more points improvement at week 16 (24.4% vs 2.4%; p < 0.001) ( Dupixent prescribing information randomized, the efficacy in patients 12 years of age with moderate-to-se vere asthma uncontrolled with a medium-to-high dose ICS plus up to 2 additional controller medications (LABA and/or leukotriene receptor antago nist). Approximately 1900 pa tients were randomized to add-on therapy with dupilumab (2 00 mg or 300 mg every 2 weeks) or matching placebo for 52 weeks. The annual rate of severe exacerbations during the 52-week study period and the absolute change in FEV 1 at week 12 were the primary endpoints. A subgroup analysis o f patients with an elevated blo od eosinophil count of 300/mm3 was also planned. Both doses of dupilumab resulted in a reduced rate (46% and 47.7%, respectively) of asthma exacerbation compared to placebo (p < 0.0001). Patients wi th higher blood eosinophil lev els had greater than 65% reduction in the annual exacerbation rate compared to placebo. The change in FEV 1 was also significantly imp roved with both doses of dupilumab compared to placebo and even more pronounced in patie nts with elevated blood eo sinophil levels. Adverse events more common with dupilumab compared to placebo included injection-site reactions and eosinophilia ( Castro et al 2018 ). In the subgroup of patients wi th baseline evidence of allerg ic asthma, dupilumab 200 mg and 300 mg every 2 weeks reduced severe asthma exac erbation rates by 36.9% and 45. 5%, respectively (both p < 0.01) and improved FEV 1 at week 12 by 0.13 and 0.16 L, r espectively (both p < 0.001) (Corren et al 2019) . A total of 210 patients 12 year s of age with oral glucocorticoid-dependent severe asthma were randomized to receive add-on therapy with dupilumab 300 mg or placebo every other wee k for 24 weeks. Glucocorticoid doses were tapered from week 4 to week 20 and then maintained at a stable dose for 4 weeks. The percentage in glucocorticoid dose reduction at week 24 was the pr imary outcome. The percentage ch ange in glucocorticoid dose was -70.1% with dupilumab vs -41.9% with placebo (p < 0.001). A dose reduction of 50% was observed in 80% of dupilumab-treated patients compared to 50% of place bo patients. Almost 70% of pat ients in the dupilumab group achieved a glucocorticoid 176 Data as of November 6, 2019 RR-U/PH-U/KAL Page 12 of 22 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The exacerbation rate was 59% lower with dupilumab compared to placebo. Inje ction site reactions and eos inophilia were more common with dupilumab compared to placebo ( Rabe et al 2018 ). A meta-analysis and systematic r eview of 4 RCTs evaluated the s afety and efficacy of dupilumab compared to placebo in approximately 3000 patients with uncontrolled asthma. The ra te of severe asthma exacerb ation was significantly reduced with dupilum ab compared to placebo (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0 .35 to 0.055; p < 0.01). FEV 1 was also significantly increased with dupilumab with a mean difference of 0.14 L (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.17; p < 0.01) . With respect to adverse events, the risk of injection sit e reactions was higher with du pilumab compared to placebo (RR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.59; p < 0.01) ( Zayed et al 2018 ). rhinosinusitis with Two trials evaluated dupilumab added to standar d of care in adults with severe bilateral chronic rhinos inusitis with nasal polyposis ( Bachert et al despite receiving intranasal cort icosteroids, systemic corticos teroids in the previous 2 year s, or sinonasal surgery. In both the 24- and 52-week trials, dupilumab resulted in significant improvement as measured by least squares mean differences in nasal polyp score (-2.06; 95% CI, -5.80 to - 4.46, respectively). The risk of any adverse eve nt, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were not significantly different between dupilumab and placebo. COMPARATIVE REVIEWS In 2017, Cockle et al conducted a systematic review and indirect treatment comparison to a ssess the comparative effectiveness and tolerability of mepolizumab and omalizumab, a s add-on therapy to standard of care, in patients with severe asthma. Studies included in the primary analysis were do uble-blind, randomized cont rolled trials, 12 weeks' duration enrolling patients with severe asthma with a documente d exacerbation history and receiving a high-dose ICS plus 1 additional controller. Two populations were examined: p atients potentially eligible for 1) both treatments (overlap population) and 2) either treatment (trial population) ( Cockle et al 2017 ). For the overlap population, no difference was found between mep olizumab and omalizumab. However, trends in favor of mepolizumab were observed, wit h median estimated RRs of 0.66 (95% credible interval [C rI], 0.37 to 1.19) for the rate of clinically significant exacerbations and 0.19 (95% CrI, 0.02 to 2.32) for the rate of exacerbations requiring hospitalization. Results of the trial population analysis showed that mepolizumab was associated with an estimated median RR of 0.63 (95% CrI, 0.45 to 0.89) corresponding to a reduction of 37% in the rate of clinically si gnificant exacerbations vs omalizumab. No difference between treatments was observed for the rate of exacerbations resulting in hospitalization; however, the medi an RR of 0.58 (95% CrI, 0.16 to 2.13) demonstrated a trend for mepolizumab over omalizumab. Both treatments had broadly comp arable effects on lung function , and similar tolerability profiles. Another 2017 systematic review was unable to detect differences in efficacy when comparing add-on therapy with mepolizumab or omalizumab in ast hma patients who were not well controlled on ICS therapy. The analysis included both randomized controlled trials and cohort studies with durat ion of 12 weeks. A total of 18 omalizumab studies (N = 4854) and 4 mepolizumab studies (N = 1620) were included. Netwo rk meta-analysis did not find a significant difference in FEV 1 between groups (mean difference, 9.3 mL in favor of mepolizuma b; 95% CI, -67.7 to 86. 3). Both omalizumab and mepolizumab reduced the annualized rates of asthma exacerbations by approximately 50% compared with placebo. Although the authors we re unable to identify significant differences in efficacy, there was high heterogeneity among the clinical trials and major differences in study inclus ion criteria (Nachef et al 2018) . A systematic review of the IL-5 antagonists, mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab, included 13 studies (N = 6000) conducted in patients with asthma poorly controlled by IC S. The majority of patients had severe eosinophilic asthma. All of the IL-5 antagonist s reduced asthma exacerbation s by approximately 50% and improved FEV 1 by 0.08 L to 0.11 L. Overall, there was not an increase in serious advers e events with any IL-5 antagonist; however, more patients discontinued benralizumab (36/159 9) than placebo (9/998) due to adverse events (Farne et al 2017) . A 2019 network meta-analysis of 11 studies aimed to indirectly compare the efficacy (n = 1855) and safety (n = 3462) of reslizumab with benralizumab in patients with eosinophilic asth ma. The efficacy analysis compared a benralizumab subgroup with blood eosinophils 300 cells/\u00b5L (n = 1537) to a reslizumab subgroup in GINA step 4/5 with 2 or more 177 Data as of November 6, 2019 RR-U/PH-U/KAL Page 13 of 22 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Re slizumab was found to have significantly greater improvement in the ACQ and AQLQ scores compared to benralizumab. No significant difference between the groups was observed in clinical asthma exacerbation, but a sensitivity analysis with the overall study population suggested a significantly greater reduction in exacerbations with reslizuma b. There were fewer discon tinuations due to adverse events with reslizumab; however, the frequency and types of adv erse events were not signifi cantly different between treatment groups (Casale et al 2019). A 2019 network meta-analysis of 11 studies compared efficacy of licensed doses of mepoliz umab, benralizumab, and reslizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma based on eosinophil levels. Mepolizumab reduced clinically significant exacerbations compared to benralizumab for patients with blood eosinophils 150 cells/\u00b5L (RR, 0.66; 00 cells/\u00b5L (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0. 99), and 400 cells/\u00b5L (RR, 0.5 5; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.87) and with mepolizumab compared to reslizumab for patients with b lood eosinophils cells /\u00b5L (RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.85). Additionally, change from baseline in ACQ score was greater with mepolizumab compared to benralizumab in patients with baseline blood eosinophils 150 cells/\u00b5L -0.36; 5% CI, -0.66 to compared with eosinophils cells/\u00b5L (difference, - 0.39; 95% CI, -0.66 to -0.12). There was no difference between reslizumab and benralizum ab in clinically significant e xacerbations or ACQ scores in patients with blood eosinophils 400 cells/\u00b5L (Busse et al 2019) . A 2019 systematic revie w and network meta-analysis of 30 random ized controlled trials compar ed biologic therapies for treatment of type 2 (ie, eosinophilic) asthma. Mepolizumab, res lizumab, and benralizumab signi ficantly reduced the risk exacerbations compared with p lacebo; however, network meta-a nalysis showed no superiori ty of any biologic therapy this outcome among benralizu mab, dupilumab, mepolizumab, re slizumab, and other the US (lebrikizumab, tralokin umab, and tezepelumab) (Edris et al 2019) . Additional meta-analyses have no t found significant differences in asthma exacerbation rates between mepolizumab and reslizumab or between benralizumab and mepolizumab (Bourdin et al 2018, Henriksen et al 2018). The magnitude of treatment effec t biologic asthma was evaluated in a network meta-analysis. The outco mes evaluated were change in FEV 1, ACQ score and AQLQ score. Event rates for asthma exacerbation and associated RRs were determined for each drug. A total of 26 studi es were included in the analysis (n = 7 benralizumab, n = 2 dupilumab, n = 4 lebrikizum ab, n = 7 mepolizumab, n = 4 reslizumab, n = 2 tralokinumab) with a total of 8444 patients (n = 4406 on active treatment, n = 4038 in contr ol groups). The duration of treatment ranged from 12 to 56 weeks. Increase in FEV 1, reduction in ACQ score and increase in AQLQ score was observed with all treatments exc ept tralokinumab. Compared to p lacebo, the greatest FEV 1 increase was with dupilumab (0.16 L; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.24), followed by reslizuma b (0.13 L; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.17), and (0.12 CI, 0.08 to 0.17) . Mepolizumab and lebrikizumab bo th had an increase of 0.09 L (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.15 with mepolizumab, 0.04 to 0.15 with lebrikizumab). Reduction in ACQ score (indicating better as thma control) in order of greatest to least reduc tion was mepolizumab, dupilumab, benrali zumab, and reslizumab. The agents had the least impact on the ACQ scor e. Quality of life scores were similarly increased wi th the 4 agents while the investigational agents had the least impact on quality of life. Compared to placebo, the calculated RR for annualized asthma exacerbation was signifi cant only for dupilumab (RR, 0.3 7; CI, 0.17 to 0.80) and reslizumab (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.78). Comparison s between treatments did not s how any significant difference for change in FEV 1, asthma control or quality of lif e except for superiority of mep olizumab to the 2 investigational agents in ACQ score reduction ( Iftikhar et al 2018 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES Asthma According to guidelines from the NHLBI/National Asthma Educatio n and Prevention Program, pharmacologic therapy is based on a stepwise approach in which medications are increased until asthma is contro lled and then decreased when possible to minimize side effect s of treatments. The level of a sthma control is based on ( NHLBI 2007 ): Reported symptoms over the past 2 to 4 weeks Current level of lung function (FEV 1 and FEV 1/forced vital capacity [FVC] values) Number of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids per year . 178 Data as of November 6, 2019 RR-U/PH-U/KAL Page 14 of 22 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. The NHLBI guidelines state that o malizumab is used as adjunctiv e therapy in patients 12 years and older who have allergies and severe persisten t asthma that is not adequately c ontrolled with the combination of high-dose ICS and LABA therapy (NHLBI 2007 ). In 2019, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) published updated guidelines for asthma management and prevention. In April 2019, GINA updated a guideline on diagnosis and manage ment of difficult-to-treat and s evere asthma. Criteria for establishing a diagnosis of severe asthma was included, which requires multiple interventions before a diagnosis can be made. For patients with a diagnosis of severe asthma, uncontrolled on Step 4 treatment (eg, 2 or more controllers or taking maintenance oral corticosteroids), phenotyping for Type 2 inflammation into categories such as severe allergic, aspirin-exacerbated, allergic bro wi th a biologic agent should be considered in patients who are uncontrolled despite a high-dose ICS/LABA or need maintenance oral corticosteroids. Anti-IgE treatment with omalizumab is recommended for patients 6 years of age with se vere allergic asthma. Similarly, add-on anti-IL-5 therapy (ie, benralizumab, mepolizumab) is recommended for patients 12 years of age or reslizumab for patients 18 years of age with severe eosinophilic asthma. Anti-IL4 receptor therapy (ie, dupilumab) is recommended for patients 12 years of age with severe eosinophilic/Type 2 asthma or patients taking o ral corticosteroids. Prior to initiation of these agents, several factors are recommended to consider including cost, ins urance eligibility criteria, evaluation of predictors of response, delivery route, the Americ an Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, and the Join t Council of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology recommend a stepwise treatment approach for CIU. Treatment with omalizumab is recommended in p atients inadequately controlled with antihistamines and a leukotriene receptor antagonist (Bernstein et al 2014 ). Joint guidelines by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network, the European Dermatology Forum, and the World Allergy Organization recommend treatment with omalizumab in patients with symptoms despite treatment with a 4 -fold dose of modern second generation antihistamines. This is a change from previous guidelines in wh ich use of either omalizumab o r cyclosporine after failure of high-dose antihistamines wa s recommended. However, due to ad verse effects and t he lack of an approved indication, the new recommendation was that cyclosporine should only be considered if omalizumab does not provide an adequate response. ( Zuberbier et al 2018 ). Recent guidelines published by t he British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology similarly recommend omalizumab as a potential sec ond-line agent in patients inadequ ately controlled on a 4-fold dose of a Powell et the EGPA (Churg-Strauss) Con sensus Task Force recommendati ons and the American Society for Apheresis guideline recommend glucocorticoi ds alone for patients without life- and/or organ-threatening EGPA. patients with life- , both glucocorticoids and a n immunosuppressant are recommended, as well as maintenance therapy with azathi oprine or methotrexate. Guidelin es from the American Society for Apheresis recognized mepolizumab as a future treatment option, and the EGPA Consensu s Task Force recommen dations noted that mepolizumab held promise for this condition based on the pilot studies available at the time of guideline development. IVIG can be considered for refrac tory EGPA or for treatment dur ing pregnancy ( Groh et al 2015, Padmanabhan et al 2019 ). AD According to the American Academy of Dermatology, interventions that provide effective control of AD for a majority of patients include non-pharmac ologic interventions with emollients, topical treatment with corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, and avoidance of environmental triggers . Phototherapy is the next opti on for children and adults with moderate to severe AD not c ontrolled with the first-line i nterventions. A third-line treatment recommended for patients who fail photot herapy is treatment with systemic immunomodulators, such as cyclosporine and methotrexate. The guidelines did not provide a recommendation on use of biologic agents due to limited data available at the time of publication ( Sidbury et al 2014 ) 179 Data as of November 6, 2019 RR-U/PH-U/KAL Page 15 of 22 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. 2017 guidance from the International Eczema Council provides clinicians with similar guidance as the American Academy of Dermatology as well as additional steps to be taken before initiation of systemic treatment. These include consideration of an alternative diagnosis, ensuring patient com pliance with topical treatmen t, a trial of intensive topical therapy, treatment of infection, i dentification and avoidance of all potential triggers, and use of phototherapy if possible. The guidance does not comment on use of biologic agen ts due to limited data ( Simpson et al 2017 ). The International Eczema Council al so published a position statement on conjunctivitis in at opic dermatitis with and without dupilumab therapy based on an opinion survey and round table discussion of its members. Based on expert opinion, a consensus was reached that patients should be inform ed about possible conjunctiv itis with dupilumab prior to treatment, patients with new-o nset conjunctivitis during dup ilumab therapy should be refe rred to ophthalmologists, and treatment should be continued after referral to an ophthalmologist (Thyssen et al 2019). A 2018 European consensus guideline from a variety of organizations on treatment of atopic eczema includes dupilumab as a treatment option for patients with moderate-to-s evere disease in whom an adequate response is not achieved with topical treatments and for whom other systemic tr eatments are not available. Concomitant use of emollients is recommended and co mbination with topical agents may be needed. No specific information on use of pediatrics was provided due to lack of data. ( Wollenberg et al 2018 ). Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Treatment of chronic rhinosinusit is with nasal polyposis is add ressed in guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery; American Academy of Aller gy, Asthma & Immunology , the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, and the Joint Council of Aller gy, Asthma & Immunology; and the International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology. Routine treatment recommendations inclu de saline irrigation and/or int ranasal glucocorticoids in patients with mild symptoms, and short-term systemic glucocorti coids and surgery in patient s with severe or refractory symptoms (Orlandi et al 2016, Peters et al 2014, Rosenfeld et al 2015) . While not approved at the time of writing, some guidelines acknowledged the demon stration of benefit with IL-5 antagonists (Orlandi et al 2016, Peters et al 2014) . SAFETY SUMMARY All agents are contraindicated in patients with a history of hy persensitivity to the specific agent or excipients in its formulation. Abrupt discontinuation of syste mic, topical or inhaled corticos teroids is not recommended when treatment with any of these agents are init iated. If appropriate, the corticosteroid dosage should be reduced gradually. Cinqair: Boxed warning: Anaphylaxis has been observed with Cinqair infus ion in 0.3% of patients in p lacebo-controlled clinical studies. Anaphylaxis was reported as early as the second dose o f Cinqair. Patients should be observed for an appropriate period of time after Cinqair administration by a healthcare professional prepared to manage anaphylaxis. Key warnings and precautions: In placebo-controlled clinical s tudies, 6/1028 (0.6%) patients receiving 3 mg/kg neoplasm reported compared to 2/730 (0.3% ) patients in the placebo group . The observed malignancies in Cinqair-treated patients were diverse in nature and without clustering of any p articular tissue type. Pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before thera py with Cinqair. If patients become infected while receiving Cinqair and do not res pond to anti-helminth treatment , Cinqair should be discontinued until the parasitic infection resolves. The most common adverse reacti on ( occurred after administration of Dupixent. Dupixent should be discontinued in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction. For patients with AD, conjunctivitis and keratitis has occurred more often when compared to placebo in clinical trials evaluating Dupixent. N ew or worsening eye s ymptoms should be re ported to a healthcare provider. For patients with asthma, cases of eosinophilic pneumonia and v asculitis consistent wit h EGPA have been reported. Occurrence of vasculitic rash, wor sening pulmonary symptoms, an d/or neuropathy, especially upon reduction of oral corticosteroids should be monitored. 180 Data as of November 6, 2019 RR-U/PH-U/KAL Page 16 of 22 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

If a patien t becomes infected while receiving Dupixent and does not r espond to anti-helminth treatment, Dupixent should be discontinued until the parasitic infection resolves. Most common adverse reactions i n patients with AD included inje ction site reactions, other herpes simplex virus infection, and dry eye. Most common adverse reactions i n patients with asthma included injection site reactions, oropharyngeal pain, and eosinophilia. Fasenra: after administration of Fasenra. Fasenra should be discontinued in the event of a hyper sensitivity reaction. Pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before thera py with Fasenra. If patients become infected while receiving Fasenra and do not res pond to anti-helminth treatment , Fasenra should be discontinued until the parasitic infection resolves. The most common adverse reactio ns ( 5%) included headache and Herpes zoster infections have oc curred in patients receiving Nu cala. Vaccination should be considered if clinically appropriate. Pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before thera py with Nucala. If patients become infected while receiving Nucala and do not res pond to anti-helminth treatment, Nucala should be discontin ued until the parasitic infection resolves. The most common adverse reactio ns ( 5%) included headache, inj ection site of the throat or tongue, has been report ed. Patients should be observe d closely for an a ppropriate period of time after Xolair administration. Health care providers administering Xolair shou ld be prepared to manage an aphylaxis that can be life- threatening. Patients with a prior history o f anaphylactic reactions to othe r causes may be at an incr eased risk for anaphylaxis. The frequency of anaphylaxis is reported to be between 0.1 to 0.2% and may occur immediat ely or up to a year post- treatment. Key warnings and precautions: Malignant neoplasms were observ ed in a higher rate of Xolair-tr eated patients (0.5%) than control patients (0.2%) in clinical trials. A subsequent 5-y ear observational cohort study found similar rates of primary malignancies in Xolair- and non-Xolair-treated patients. H owever, study limitations pre clude definitively ruling out a malignancy risk with Xolair ( Long et al 2014 ). Rarely, patients on therapy with Xolair may present with seriou s systemic eosinophilia, w hich may present with features of vasculitis consisten t with Churg-Strauss syndrome. These events usually have been associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Some patients have re ported signs and symptoms simila r to serum sickness, including arthriti s/arthralgia, rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy. Adverse reactions in asthma st udies: In patients 12 years of age, the most commonly obse rved adverse reactions in clinical studies ( 1% in Xola ir-treated patient s and more frequently than reported with plac ebo) were arthralgia, pain (general), leg pain, fatigue, di zziness, fracture, arm pain, pruritus, dermatitis, and earac he. In clinical studies with pediatric patients 6 to < 12 years of age, the most common adve rse reactions were nasopharyngitis, headache, pyrexia, upper abdominal pain, streptococc al pharyngitis, otitis media, viral gastroenteritis, arthropod bites, and epistaxis. 181 Data as of November 6, 2019 RR-U/PH-U/KAL Page 17 of 22 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Adverse reactions in CIU studies : Adverse reactions from 3 plac ebo-controlled, multiple-dose CIU studies that occurred in 2% of patients receiving Xolair and more frequently than i n those receiving placebo included arthralgia, cough, headache, nasopharyngitis, nausea , sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and viral upper respiratory tract infection. Cardiovascular and ce rebrovascular events in asthma studies: In a 5-year observational cohort study, a higher incidence of overall cardiovascular and cerebrovascular serious adverse events was observed in Xolair-treated patients compared to non-Xolair-treated pat ients. To further evaluate th e risk, a pooled analysis of 25 randomized, controlled, clinical trials was conducted. A n increased risk of cardiovascu lar and cerebrovascular seri ous adverse events was not noted, but the low number of events, the young pat ient populati on, and the short duration o f follow-up prevent a definite conclusion about the absence of a risk ( FDA 2014 ).

CONCLUSION Xolair is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is FDA-approved for patients 6 years of age and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and whose symptoms are inadequately controlle d with an ICS. Xolair has been shown to decrease the incidence of asthma exacerbations in these patients. Although clinical trial results have been mixed and several trials had an open-labe l design, there is some evidence to indicate that Xolair may decrease asthma-related emergency visi ts and hospitalizations, as well as decreasing the dose of ICS and rescue medication and in creasing sympto m-free days ( Buhl et al 2002, Busse et al 2011, Holgate et al 2004, Lanier et al 2003, Sol\u00e8r et al 2011 ). Xolair is administered SC in a physician's office every 2 to 4 weeks in a dose that is det ermined by body weight and the levels of serum IgE. Xolair carries a boxed warning due to the risk of anaphylaxis, and thus must be administered under medical supervision. Although Xolair therapy is generally safe, analysis of a 5-year , observational cohort, epidemi ological study (EXCELS) showed an increased number of c ardiovascular and cerebrovascular adverse events in pati ents receiving Xolair compared to placebo ( Iribarren et al 2017 ). However, a pooled analysis of 25 randomized, double-blind, p lacebo- controlled clinical trials did not find notable imbalances in t he rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular serious adverse events ( FDA 2014 ). Asthma guidelines generally reco mmend Xolair therapy in patients with severe allergic a sthma that is inadequately controlled with a combinati on ). Based on the limited place in therapy and t he need for administration under medical supervision, Xolair is appropriate for a small percentage of pati ents with asthma. Xolair received FDA approval fo r the treatment of adults and ad olescents (12 years of a ge and above) with CIU who remain symptomatic despite H 1-antihistamine treatment. Two ran domized, placebo-controlled trials demonstrated its efficacy in reducing weekly itc h severity scores and weekly hiv e count scores significantly greater than placebo at week 12. Xolair was well-tolerated, w ith a safety profile similar to that observed in asthma patient s. In patients with CIU, Xolair is dosed at 150 or 300 mg SC every 4 weeks in a physician's off ice. Guidelines for the tr eatment of CIU recommend treatment with Xolair in patients who are inadequately controll ed with a 4-fold dose o f modern second-generation antihistamines. Although previous guidelines suggested the use of omalizumab after a leukot riene receptor antagonist, the most recent guideline from t he European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, the Global Allergy and Asthma European Networ k, the European Dermatology Forum, and th e World Allergy Organi zation state that a recommendation regarding use of a leukotriene receptor antagoni st cannot be made due to a low level of evidence. Additionally, use of Xolair is r ecommended before treatment wit h cyclosporine ( Bernstein et al 2014, Zuberbier et al 2018, Powell et al 2015 ). Cinqair, Fasenra, and Nucala are IL-5 antagonists approved as a dd-on treatment options fo r patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, and have dem onstrated effectiveness in red ucing asthma exacerbations ( Bel et al 2014, Bjermer et al 2016, Castro et al 2015, Corren et al 2016, Pavord et al 2012, Ortega et al 2014, Bleecker et al 2016, Fitzgerald et al 2016 ). The mechanism of action of Fas enra is slightly different, in that it binds to the IL-5 rec eptor on immune effector cells, whereas Cinqair and Nucala bind to the IL-5 cytokine. Al l of these agents provide a more targeted treatment option for patients with severe , refractory asthma and should b e considered in those with an eosinophilic phenotype uncontrolled on conventional asthm a therapy after confirmation of severe disease, along with individual patient factors (GINA 2019a, GINA 2019b 3 FDA-approved indica tions: treatment of patients 12 years of age with moderate-to-severe AD, treatment of patients 12 years of age with severe asthma of t he eosinophilic type or dependent on oral corticosteroids, and add-on treatment in adul ts with inadequately controll ed chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. Its use in AD should be determined by its approved indication and clin ician judgment.

The approval of Dupixent in chronic rhinosinus itis with nasal polyposis occ urred after publication of guidelines, although some acknowledged the potential role for biologic therapies (Orlandi et al 2016, Peters et al 2014). Nucala is the only antiasthmatic monoclonal antibody approved f or the treatment of adult patients with EGPA. There are no head-to-head trials comparing Cinqair, Fasenra, Du pixent and Nucala. However, a systematic review of the IL-5 antagonists conducted in patients with asthma poorly c ontrolled by ICS revealed tha t all of the IL-5 antagonists reduced asthma exacerbations by approximately 50% and improved FEV 1 by 0.08 L to 0.11 L. O verall, there was not an increase in serious adverse ev ents with any IL-5 antagonist; however, more patients di scontinued benralizumab (36/1599) than placebo (9/998) due to adverse events (Farne et al 2017). One network meta-analysis of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 antagonists demonstrat ed that all agents reduced FEV 1 and improved ACQ and AQLQ scores, exc ept for the investigational agent, tralokinumab; another found mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizum ab significantly reduced the risk of exacerbations compared with placebo (Iftikhar et al 2018, Edris et al 2019 ) Compared to Nucala and Fasenra , Cinqair does have several limitations, including: an indica tion for patients 18 years of age (vs 6 and 12 y ears of age with Nucala and Fasenra, res pectively), IV administrat ion (SC for Nucala and Fasenra), and boxed warning fo r anaphylaxis. Dupixent is indi cated for treatment of pati ents 12 years of age with both severe asthma and AD. Subcutaneous autoinjector formul ations are available for Bachert C, Han JK, Desrosiers M , et al.

Therapeutic Class Overview Intranasal Allergic Rhinitis Agents INTRODUCTION Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an i nflammatory, immunoglobulin E (Ig E)-mediated disease characte rized by nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and/or na sal itching. It is generally vie wed as either seasonal AR (S AR) or perennial AR (PAR). SAR is caused by seasonal aeroallergens, such as pollens, and P AR is caused by year-round environmental aeroallergens such as dust mites, mold, animal allergens, or occupational allergens ( Seidman et al 2015 ). AR is common, affecting 10% to 30% of adults and up to 40% of childre n in the United States (US) ( Wallace et al 2008 ). Pharmacologic therapy for ludes antihistamines oral), deconges tants and oral) , cromolyn, IN antagonists (LTRAs) (Dykewicz et al 2017). IN treatments are often selected over oral therapies based on t heir high effectiveness an d targeted local effects (Wallace et al 2008, Seidman et al 2015 ). IN corticosteroids are generally considered the most effective class of medications for controlling AR symptoms. IN antihistamines are additional options for the treatment of A R and may be considered for first-line use. IN anticholinergics reduce rhinor rhea but are not effective for other AR symptoms. Clinicians may offer combination therapy to patients with an in adequate response to monotherapy. Vasomotor rhinitis is a type o f nonallergic (non-IgE-mediated) rhinitis ( Wallace et al 2008 ). Symptoms are similar to those of AR and include sneezing , congestion, and runny nose. Itchy nose, eyes and throat are typically absent. Symptoms of vasomotor rhinitis can be triggered by airborne pol lutants or odors, certain foods and medications, changes in the weather, or underlying health problems ( American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology [AAAAI] 2019 ). IN corticosteroids, IN antih anticholinergi cs are effective for vasomotor rhinitis (Wallace et al 2008 ). Nasal polyps are soft, painless gr owths on the lining of nasal passages or sinuses, which result from chronic inflammation due to asthma, infection, allergies, drug sensitiv ity, or immune disorders (Mayo Clinic 2018 ). Nasal polyps often occur in the setting of chr onic rhinosinusitis. Larger po lyps may lead to symptoms such as blocked nasal passages, breathing problems, reduced sense of smell, and infec tions. Medications such as IN corticosteroids can shrink or eliminate nasal polyps ; however, surgical removal is sometimes necessary. Nasal polyps often return after treatment. Effectiveness is often evaluated with the use of the total nasa l symptom score (TNSS). Although there is some variability in specific studies, the TNSS is typically the sum of individual symptom scores for nasal i tching, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal congestion. Symptoms ar e often rated on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe), and twice-daily scores may be summed or averaged, so the scor e range may be 0 to 12 or 0 to 2 4 depending on the study design. A minimum clinically important difference in TNSS has not been definitively establis hed ( Glacy et al 2013, Meltzer et al 2016 ). This therapeutic class overview includes IN corticosteroids, IN antihistamines, and IN anticholinergics. Specific products are listed in Table 1. Note tha t in some cases, there is more than one brand name for the same chemical entity. Most products are formulated as aqueous nasal sprays. One produ ct, Xhance (fluticasone p ropionate), uses a novel delivery system containing a nos epiece and a mouthpiece; it use s the patient's ex haled breath to facilitate delivery of drug deep into the nasal passages. Two products, Qnasl (beclomethasone dipropionate) and Zetonna (ciclesonide), are formulated as nasal aerosols. Several products formerly avail able by prescription are now ava ilable solely as over-the-counter (OTC) products. These products include: fluticasone fu roate (Flonase formerly marketed product Veramyst), budesonide (Rhinocort Allergy, form erly marketed as triamcinolone product Nasacort A Q). Fluticasone propionate is available as a prescription product (generic only; the brand is no longer marketed) and an OTC product (Flonase Allergy of November 5, 2019 RLP/AKS Page 2 of 14 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY IN Corticosteroids Daily administration of IN corticosteroids is associated with s tatistically significant impro vements in allergy-related TNSS and health-related quality of lif e (QoL) scores. Numerous head-to-head clinical trials comparing the available IN corticosteroids have generally demonstrated no significant clinical differences among the available IN corticosteroids with regard to efficacy. Some st udies have reported differences in sensory perceptions and patient preference with 1 agent compared to another. Pati ents administering the agents no ted differences in odor, aftertaste, and severity of irritation; however, these differences were not associated with differences in effica cy between the agents ( Aasand et al 1982, Al-Mohaimeid 1993, Andersson et al 1995, Bachert et al 2002, Berger et al 2003, Day et al 1998, Drouin et al 191 Data as of November 5, 2019 RLP/AKS Page 5 of 14 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

IN corticosteroid aerosol form ulations have been demonstrated t o be significantly more effe ctive compared to placebo. Aerosol formulations may be asso ciated with increased retention of medication in the nasal cavity and decreased dripping from the nose and deposi tion in the back of the throat compared to aqueous formulations ( Leach et al 2015 ). However, data on effectiveness vs traditional spray formulation s are lacking. Beclomethasone: In a 6-week study of patients wi th PAR, aerosoliz ed beclomethas one significantly improved reflective TNSS compared to placebo (-2.46 vs -1.63; p < 0.001). Furthermore, b eclomethasone was associated with a statistically significant improvement in QoL score compared to placebo (p = 0 .001) ( Meltzer et al 2012[a] ). A 2-week study of beclomethasone nasal aerosol 80 mcg daily in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age with SAR also demonstrated improvement in reflective TNSS compared to pl acebo (-1.9 vs -1.2; p < 0.001) ( Storms 12-week study of beclomethasone nasal aerosol 80 mcg daily in pediatric patients 4 to 11 years of age with PAR demonstrated improvement in both reflective and instantaneous TNSS compared to place bo (mean treatment differences, -0.53 [p 0.009] and -0.52 [p ). Ciclesonide: meta-analysis of 8 studies (4,039 patients) evaluating cicles onide vs placebo for PAR found that ciclesonide was associated with significant redu ctions in the reflective and in stantaneous TNSS,as well as the reflective nasal symptom score (rNSS) subtotal compared to placebo, with no diff erence in treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) (Yang et al 2018 ). Ciclesonide administered at a da ily dose of 80 mcg or 160 mcg r educed reflective TNSS by 15.1 and 16%, respectively, compared to 3.7% wi th placebo (p < 0.001 for both ). In addition, significant improvements were observed with both doses of cicle sonide compared to placebo wit h regard to ocular symptom scores and QoL (p < 0.001 for both) ( Ratner et al 2010). Similar improvements in outcome s were reported in additional st udies of up to 26 weeks duration (Berger et al 2012, LaForce et al 2009, Mohar et al 2012, Ratner et al 2012 ). The approval of Xhance (fluticasone propionate) for the treatme nt of nasal based on two 16-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trials ( Leopold et al 2019, Sindwani et al 2019 ). Adults with nasal po lyps and associated moderate to severe nasal congestion showed improvement in nasal congestion/obstruction and bilateral polyp grade when treated with fluticasone propionate using the Xhance delivery device. Published data from 1 of the 2 studies demonstrated that improvements in symptoms and polyp grade cont inued to increase with an additional 8 weeks of open-label treatment ( Leopold et al 2019 ). Use of Xhance was also shown to improve chronic rhinosinusit is symptoms and polyp grade in a 12-month open -label trial, and the product was well tolerated ov er this time period ( Palmer et al 2018 ). However, data are not available comparing Xhance to fluticas one propionate (or other corticosteroids) in a traditional nasal spray formulation. Two meta-analyses have reviewed information on the use of IN corticosteroids for treatmen t of chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps. A meta-analysis of 18 randomized trials (N = 2738) reviewed the use of IN corticoster oids vs placebo or no intervention, and demonstrated t hat IN corticosteroids improved symptoms, including a mo derate-sized benefit for nasal blockage and a small benefit for rhinorrhea ( Chong et al 2016[a]). Little information on QoL was available. A meta-analysis of 9 randomized tr ials (N = 911) found insufficient evidence to suggest differences in efficacy among different IN corticosteroids or between a spray and an aerosol (Chong et al 2016[b] ). Lower doses appeared to have similar effectiveness and fewer side effects than higher doses. A recent Cochrane systematic r eview including 34 randomized tri als evaluated the effects of i ntranasal steroids for the management of non-allergic rhini tis. In 2 separate pooled analy ses of 4 trials, results found that IN corti costeroids slightly improved patient-report ed disease severity (TNSS score ) compared to placebo up to week 4 (standard mean difference [SMD], -0. 74; 95% CI, -1.15 to -0.05, respec tively). However, from 4 weeks to 3 months, data were inc onclusive, suggesting that it is unclear whether IN corticosteroids reduced patient 192 Data as of November 5, 2019 RLP/AKS Page 6 of 14 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Additionally, an anal ysis of 4 studies suggested a higher risk of epistaxis compared to placebo (RR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.24 to 3.57) ( Segboer et al 2019). IN Antihistamines IN azelastine has been shown to be safe and effective over 14 days of treatment in plac ebo-controlled trials ( Howland et al 2011, Lumry et al 2007, van Bavel et al 2009 ). When azelastine 0.1% and azelasti ne 0.15% were compared to plac ebo in a 2-week trial, there was a significantly greater improvement in TNSS for both concentrations vs placebo (p < 0.001). In a r etrospective analysis, there was a statistically significant differe nce in favor of azelastine 0.1 5% compared to azelast ine 0.1% (p ( Shah et al 2009[a] ). IN olopatadine has been proven safe and effective in placebo-co ntrolled trials across a range of doses ( Fairchild et al 2007, Hampel et al 2006, Meltzer et al 2005, Meltzer et al 2011, Patel et al 2007, Ratner et al 2005 ). Head-to-head studies have not dem onstrated any statistically si gnificant differences in efficacy between azelastine and olopatadine ( Lieberman et al 2011, Shah et al 2009[b] ). In patients with SAR, azelasti ne 0.1% and olopatadine 0.6% redu ced symptom scores to a s imilar extent in a 16-day trial. Tolerability was simila r between agents, with the except ion of the prevalence and intens ity of bitter taste, which were lower with olopatadine ( Shah et al 2009[b] ). In both azelastine 0.1% and o lopatadine 0.6% significant ly reduced symptom scores from baseline in a 2-week clin ical trial; the difference betwee n treatments was not statistically significant. The overall incidence of AEs was similar between the 2 groups. The most com mon AE was taste disturbance, which was reported in 10.3% and 5.3% of patients in the azelastine and olopatadine groups, respectively ( Lieberman et al 2011 ). In a single-dose crossover study evaluating sensory attributes, 60.6% of patients favored 30.3% favored azelastine, and 9.2% had no pref erence. Mean patient preference was significantly greater with olopatadine than azelastine for overall aftertaste, overall preference, and like lihood of use ( Meltzer et al 2008 ). IN Anticholinergics For the common cold, ipratropium bromide nasal spray has been shown to reduce the severi ty of rhinorrhea compared to placebo or no treatment, although it had no effect on nasal congestion. Overall, nasal d ryness was the most common AE reported ( AlBalawi et al 2013, Diamond et al 1995, Dockhorn et al 1992, Eccles et al 2007, Hayden et al 1996 ). For the treatment of perennial allergic or nonallergic rhinitis , ipratropium bromide has been s hown to significantly reduce the severity and duration of rhinorrhea compared to no treatmen t or placebo ( Bronsky et al 1995, Dockhorn et al 1999, Georgitis et al 1994, Kaiser et al 1998, Meltzer et al 1997 ). Nasal congestion was not significantly improved. Combination Therapy and Comparisons Among Different Drug Classe s The Agency for Healthcare Resear ch and Quality (AHRQ) published a comparative effectiveness review of pharmacological therapies for the treatment of SAR ( Glacy et al 2013 ). A total of 59 randomized controlled trials met inclusion criteria to compare agents of 6 classes for relative efficacy. Agents included oral and IN antihistamines and decongestants, normal saline. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to draw a co nclusion about relative effic acy among most of the agents used for the treatment of SAR. For a few comparisons, sufficient evidence was available t o draw a conclusion. Oral se lective antihistamines and montelukast were equivalent for efficacy in reducing nasal and eye symptoms. Montelukas t was superior to oral selective antihistamines for c ontrolling asthma symptoms. IN antihistamines and IN corticosteroids had equivalent efficacy for nasal and eye symp toms. Similarly, montelukast was comparable to IN corticost eroids for nasal symptoms. The combination of IN antihistami nes and IN corticosteroids demonstrated equivalent efficacy in nasal and eye symptom resolution compared to either mo notherapy. For children, conclu sions about relative efficacy were not determined due to insufficient evidence. A systematic review and meta-ana lysis evaluated results from 5 randomized trials that compar ed IN corticosteroids to oral antihistamines in patients with AR ( Juel-Berg et al 2017 ). Results demonstrated t hat IN corticosteroids were superior to oral antihistamines fo r improving TNSS (difference, -0.70; 95% CI, -0.93 to -0.47) . There was no difference in relief of ocular symptoms. Four a dditional trials were included in a narrative review, and re sults were consistent with studies in the meta-analysis. A meta-analysis compared azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray t o other agents used in the management of SAR and PAR which included beclomethasone nasal spray and loratadine co mbination, terfenadine (not a vailable in the US), oral 193 Data as of November 5, 2019 RLP/AKS Page 7 of 14 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Azelastine was demonstrated to improve symptoms compared to placebo. The analysis did not identify a statistically signi ficant difference in treatmen t response for azelastine comp ared to active comparators, despite multiple analyses. A meta-analysis of 8 randomized tr ials in patients with allergi c rhinitis found combinat ion therapy with intranasal fluticasone propionate and azelasti ne led to significantly greater reductions in TNSS from baseline compared to placebo or monotherapy with either agent ( Debbaneh et al with fluticasone pr opionate nasal spray was si gnificantly more effective compared to the individual agents in various symptom scores in a 2-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial (Ratner et al 2008 ). improvement in TNSS from baseline was 37.9% for combinat ion therapy compared to 27.1% and 24.8%, respectively, with single-entity fluticasone and aze lastine (p < 0.05 for the co mbination vs either agent alone). Other randomized trials comparing the combination of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have also demonstrated significant improvements in TNSS, individual symptom scores, and QoL ratings compared to each agent administered as monotherapy ( Carr et al 2012, Hampel et al 2010, Meltzer et al 2012[b], Ilyina et al 2019 ). A randomized, active-controlled, open-label study demonstrated that long-term treatment with combination azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone prop ionate nasal spray was well t olerated in adults and adolescents over a 1-year period (Berger et al 2014 ). Another randomized, active-cont rolled, open-label study demo nstrated that this combination was safe and well tolerated in pedi atric patients age d 4 to 11 year s over a 3-month period ( Berger et al 2018 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) and the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) jointly publis hed guidelines on the diagnosi s and management of rhinitis in 2008, and a focused update on the treatment of SAR was published by these groups in 2017. The 2008 guidelines note that ( Wallace et al 2008 ): IN corticosteroids are the most effective medication class for controlling symptoms of AR. They may also be useful in the treatment of some form s of nonallergic rhinitis. When comparing the available IN corticosteroids, the overall cl inical response does not appear to vary significantly between products. IN antihistamines may be consi dered for use as first-line treat ment for allergic and nonalle rgic rhinitis. However, IN antihistamines are generally le ss effective than IN corticoster oids for treatment of AR. IN anticholinergics may effectively reduce rhinorrhea but have no effect on other nasal symptoms. The concomitant use of ipratropium bromide nasal spray and an IN corticosteroid is more effective than administration of either drug al one in the treatment of rhinorr hea. The 2017 focused update on treat ment of SAR notes that, for the initial treatment of nas al symptoms of SAR (Dykewicz et al 2017): For patients aged 12 years, clin icians should routinely prescribe monotherapy with an IN corticosteroid rather than a combination of an IN corti costeroid with an oral antihis tamine. For patients aged 15 years, c linicians should recommend an IN corticosteroid over an LTRA. For moderate to severe symptoms in patients aged 12 years, cl inicians may recommend the combination of an IN corticosteroid and an IN antihistamine. Guidelines on AR from the Amer ican Academy of Otolaryngology-He ad and Neck Surgery F oundation note that (Seidman et al 2015): Clinicians should recommend IN c orticosteroids for patients wit h a clinical diagnosis of A R whose symptoms affect their QoL. There are no significant differe nces in efficacy between the av ailable agents. Sensory attributes, including aftertaste, nose runout, throat rundown, and smell, are an impo rtant factor in patient preference and adherence to therapy. Aerosol preparations ma y address some of these concern s. Comparative studies have shown that IN corticosteroids are supe rior to oral antihistamines in controlling nasal symptoms, including nasal congestion, with no significant diffe rence in the relief of ocular symptoms. IN corticosteroids are more effec tive than LTRAs across the range of allergy symptoms. However, IN antihistamines have a more rapid onset of action than IN corticosteroids in co mparison studies. 194 Data as of November 5, 2019 RLP/AKS Page 8 of 14 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. In addition to improving nasal s ymptoms, IN corti costeroids have beneficial effects on alle rgic eye symptoms such as itching, tearing, redness, and puffiness. Clinicians should recommend oral s econd-generation/less-sedatin g antihistamines for patients with AR and primary complaints of sneezing and itching. Clinicians should not offer oral LTRAs as primary therapy for p atients with AR. Clinicians may offer IN antihista mines for patients with season al, perennial, or episodic AR. IN antihistamines are effective treatments for AR and can be used as first- or second-line therapy. For the treatment of nasal sympt oms, IN antihistamines have shown equality or superiority to oral antihistamines in numerous studies. Azelastine and olopatadine have equal efficacy in head-to-head, placebo-controlled comparison studies. Clinicians may offer combinati on pharmacologic therapy in patie nts with AR who have an inadequate response to pharmacologic monotherapy. The most effective addition to an IN corticosteroid is an IN an tihistamine. According to the International Co nsensus Statement on Allergy a nd Rhinitis for AR ( Wise et al 2018 ): IN corticosteroids: Benefits: IN corticosteroids are effective in reducing nasal an d ocular symptoms of AR. T hey have superior efficacy compared to oral antihistamines and LTRAs. Harms/disadvantages: IN corticosteroids hav e undesirable local AEs such as epistaxis with prolonged administration. There might be some negative effects on short-t erm growth in children, but it is unclear whether these effects translate into long-term growth suppression. Recommendation: IN cor ticosteroids are str ongly recommended and should be used as first-line therapy for AR. IN antihistamines: Benefits: IN antihistamines have a rapid onset, are more effect ive for nasal congestion than oral antihistamines, are more effective for ocular sympt oms than IN corticosteroids, and show consistent reduction in symptoms and improvement in QoL compared to placebo. Harms/disadvantages: T here are concerns fo r patient tolerabilit y, especially due to taste. IN antihistamines are less effective for congestion than IN corticosteroids. Recommendation: IN antihistamine s are recommend ed and may be us ed as first-line or seco nd-line therapy for AR. IN anticholinergic (ie, of an IN antichol inergic reduces rhinorrhea. Harms/disadvantages: Local side effects include nasopharyngeal irritation, burning, headache, pharyngitis, epistaxis, nasal dryness, nasal congestion, and dry mouth. Care should be taken to avoid overdosage leading to systemic side effects. Recommendation: An IN anticholi nergic is an option for the treatment of AR and may be considered as an adjunct to IN corticosteroids in PAR pat ients with uncontrolled rhinorr hea. The combination of an IN corti costeroid and an IN antihistamine is strongly recommended when monotherapy fails to control AR symptoms. Combinations of an oral antihista mine and an IN corticosteroid are an option, with the co mbination equivocal over either drug alone. Guidelines from Allergic Rhiniti s and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA), a part of the European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airway D iseases (EUFOREA), suggest the use of an IN corticosteroid over an IN antihistamine in patients with AR (SAR and PAR ). No preference is stated for IN corticosteroid monotherapy vs IN corticosteroid/ IN antihistamine combination t for IN oral antihistamine ( Brozek et al 2017 ). Joint guidelines on the diagnosis and management of rhinosinusi tis are available from the AAAAI, the ACAAI, and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (JCAAI) ( Peters et al 2014). According to these guidelines: IN corticosteroids (sprays and aerosols) have been extensively studied as a treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Several different IN corticosteroids have been sh own to be effective at decre asing nasal polyp size or preventing the regrowth of nasal polyps after surgical removal; however, head-to-hea d studies comparing different IN corticosteroids are not available. The published studies have consis tently shown IN corticosteroid s to be superior to placebo for improving nasal patency, lessening nasal symptoms , decreasing polyp size, and i mproving QoL when used for 1 to 12 months; however, the magnitude of effect is variable. 195 Data as of November 5, 2019 RLP/AKS Page 9 of 14 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. The extent to which the use of IN corticosteroids prevents the need for sinus surgery or r egrowth of nasal polyps is not well established. Joint guidelines from the Europ ean Rhinologic Society (ERS) and the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) also support the use of IN corticosteroids i n the management of chronic rh inosinusitis with nasal polyps ( Fokkens et al odern\" IN corticosteroids (mom etasone, fluticasone, and ciclesonide) do IN corticosteroids (budesonide, beclomethasone, betamethasone, triamcinolone, and dexamethasone), although they may have fewer AEs. SAFETY SUMMARY IN corticosteroids Key warnings and precautions among the IN corticosteroids inclu de the following: or pharynx, and impaired wound healing Development of glaucoma or cataracts Hypersensitivity reactions, inc luding and wo rsening of existing tuberculosis ; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex; or more serious or even fa tal course of chicken pox or measles in susceptible individuals Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression Potential reduction in gro wth velocity in children Common AEs include cough, pharyn gitis, nasal discomfort, headac he, and epistaxis.

Therapeutic Class Overview Opioid Use Disorder Agents INTRODUCTION Products for Treatment of Opioid Dependence The American Psychiatric Associat ion (APA) defines opioid use d isorder as a syndrome characterized by a problematic pattern of opioid use, leading to clinically significant impairment or distress ( APA 2013 ). In 2015, approximately 2 million Am ericans had a substance use disorder involving prescription pain relievers and 591,000 had a substance use di sorder involving heroin ( American Society of Addi ction Medicine [ASAM] 2016). Methadone, buprenorphine (with or without naloxone), and naltre xone are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved for the detoxification and maintenance treatment of op ioid dependence ( Micromedex 2.0 2019 ). Methadone products, when used for the treatment of opioid addic tion in detoxification or m aintenance programs, may be dispensed only by opioid treatment programs (and agencies, p ractitioners, or institutions by formal agreement with the program sponsor) certified by the Substance Abuse and Menta l Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and approved by the designated state authority. Certified treatment programs may dispense and use methadone in oral form only and according to the tr eatment requirements stipulate d in the Federal Opioid Treatment Standards (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 42, Sec 8). The Drug Addiction Treatment A ct (DATA) of 2000 expanded the cl inical context of medication-assisted opioid addiction treatment by allowing qualified physicians to dispens e or prescribe specifically approved medications, like buprenorphine, for the treatment of opioid addiction in treatme nt settings other than the traditional Opioid Treatment Program. In addition, DATA reduc ed the regulatory burden on phy sicians who choose to pra ctice opioid addiction therapy by permitting qualified physicians to apply for and rec eive waivers of the special registration requirements defined in the Controlled Substances Act ( Center for Substance Abuse Treatment [CSAT] 2004 ). Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, i s only indicated for the prevention of relapse after opioi d detoxification; patients must be opioid-free for at least 7 to 10 days prior to initiati on of naltrexone therapy in order to avoid precipitation of withdrawal. All buprenorphine pr oducts are Schedule III controlled substanc es (Drugs@FDA 2019 ). In 2012, Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals notified the FDA tha t they were voluntarily dis continuing production of Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone) sublingu al tablets as a result of incr easing concerns over accidental pediatric exposure with the tablets. The uni que child-resistant, unit-dose packaging of the film formulation is believed to be a contributing factor to reduce ex posure rates in children. Gener ic formulations of the sublingual tablets remain available. In November 2017, the FDA approved Sublocade (buprenorphine ER) SC injection for the treatment of moderate to severe opioid use disorder in patients who have initiated treat ment with a transmucosal buprenorphine-containing product, followed by dose adjustment for a minimum of 7 days. Sublocade is injected as a liquid and the subsequent precipitat ion of the polymer creates a solid depot which contains buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is r eleased via diffusion from, an d the biodegradat ion of, the depot. On September 7, 2018, a new dosage strength of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual films was approved by the FDA under the brand name Cassipa. However, t he launch of this produ ct has been delayed due to patent infringement claims made by the manufacturer of Subox one. The current estimated lau nch date of Cassipa is unk nown, but launch may not occur until 2024 ( Fry 2019 ). Lofexidine, an oral central alpha -2 agonist, was a pproved in Ma y 2018 for the mitigation of opioid withdrawal symptoms to facilitate abrupt opioid disc ontinuation in adults. This pro duct is indicated for short-term use, up to 14 days, during the period of peak opioid withdrawal symptoms. Included in this review are the products that are FDA-approved to be used in the treatment of opioid dependence; however, methadone products are not included since they must be dispensed in an opioid treatment program when used for the treatment of opioid addiction in detoxification.

Generic version not anticipated until 2032. (Drugs@FDA 2019, Orange Book: Approv ed Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations 2019) Products for Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Opiate overdose continues to be a major public health problem i n the United States (U. S.). It has contributed significantly to accidental deaths among those who use or abuse illicit and prescription opioids. The number of opioid overdoses has risen in recent y ears, partly due to a nearly 4-f old increase in the use of prescribed opioids for the treatment of pain. Overdose deat hs involving opioids increased to more than 42,000 deaths in 2016 ( SAMHSA 2018) . Death following opioid overdose can be averted by emergency bas ic life support and/or the ti mely administration of an opioid antagonist such displaces opiates from r eceptor sites in the brain and reverses respiratory depressi on, which is usually the cause of overdose deaths (SAMHSA 2018, World Health Organization [WHO] 2014) . Naloxone is provided to patients through the regular course of medical care, by pharmacist-initiated collaborative practice agreements, or through community-based opioid overdose prevention programs ( Doe-Simkins 2014 ). Recognizing the potential value of providing naloxone to layper sons, most states have passed laws and changed regulations authorizing prescrib ers to provide naloxone through standing orders and/or to pot ential overdose witnesses as well as protecting those who administer naloxone from penalties for practicing medicine without a license ( Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [MMWR] 2012, Coffin 2019 ). In December 2018, the U.S. Departm ent of Health & Human Service s (HHS) recommended prescribing or co- prescribing naloxone to all patients who are at risk for opioid overdose, including: patients receiving opioids at a dosage of 50 milligram morphine equival ents (MME) per d ay or greater; patients with respiratory con ditions who are prescribed opioids; patients who have been prescribed benzodiazepines alon g with opioids; and patients prescribed opioids who have a non-opioid substance use disorder, report excessive alcohol use, or have a mental health disorder ( HHS 2018 ). In patients with opi oid overdose, naloxo ne begins to reverse sedation, respiratory depressi on, and hypotension within 1 to 2 minutes after intravenous ( IV) administration, 2 to 5 minu tes after IM or SC administrat ion, and 8 to 13 minutes after intranasal (IN) administration . Since the half-life of naloxone is much shorter than that of most opioids, repeated administration may be necessary (Lexicomp 2019) . Naloxone was first approved by the FDA in 1971. In April 2014, an auto-injector formulation of naloxone was approved (Evzio) which incorporates both audio and visual instructions t o guide the person adminis tering the drug during a medical emergency. In November 2015, the FDA approved the first IN formulation of naloxone (Narcan nasal spray). Prior to the approval of these products, naloxone was only avai lable in glass vials and ampules, which were distributed with syringes and needles for manual injection or with syringes and atomizers for off-l abel IN administration ( Evzio FDA Summary Review 2014 ). Included in this review are the naloxone products that are FDA- approved for opioid overdose.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Products for Treatment of Opioid Dependence Clinical trials have demonstrat ed that buprenorphine/naloxone is practical and safe for use in diverse community treatment settings including primary care offices ( Amass et al 2004, Fiellin et al 2008 ). Studies have shown that in adult patients with opioid dependenc e, the percentage of opioid- negative urine tests was significantly higher for both bupr enorphine and buprenorphine/n aloxone compared to placebo, while no significant difference was seen between the 2 active treatment groups ( Daulouede et al 2010, Fudala et al 2003 ). In addition, a small randomized controlled trial (N = 32) also showed no signi ficant difference in wit hdrawal symptoms between buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone (Strain et al 2011 ). Several studies have compared the effectiveness of short-term d etoxification to medium- or long-term maintenance treatment with buprenorphine monot herapy or buprenorphine/nalox one. Three studies have shown higher treatment retention rate or self-reported drug use with longer treatment duration compared to detoxif ication; however, 1 of the studies showed no significant difference in the percentage of p ositive urine tests between the 2 treatment groups at 12 weeks (Kakko et al 2003, Weiss 2011, Woody et al 2008 ). In a meta-analysis of 21 randomiz ed controlled trials, patients receiving buprenorphine at d oses 16 mg/day were more likely to continue treatment compa red to patients receiving dos es < 16 mg/day; however, no significant difference was seen in the percentage of opioi d-positive urine tests between t he high- and low-dose groups ( Fareed et al 2012 ). Studies that compared different dosing regimens of buprenorphin e showed no difference in ra te of treatment retention, percentage of urine tests positi ve for opioids, or withdrawal s ymptoms ( Bickel et al 1999, Gibson et al 2008, Petry et al 1999, Schottenfeld et al 2000 ). One study found tha t buprenorphine/nalox one sublingual film was comparable to the sublingual tablet form in dose equivalence and clinical outcomes ( Lintzeris et al 2013 ). A randomized, parallel-group, noninferiority trial (N = 758) fo und that for the treatment of patients with opioid dependence, Zubsolv (buprenorphine/naloxone) sublingual tablets was noninferior to generic buprenorphine sublingual 205 Data as of August 20, 2019 LK-U/JA-U/KAL Page 5 of 14 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. tablets during induction and was noninferior to buprenorphine/n aloxone sublingual film during early stabilization (Gunderson et al 2015 ). Buprenorphine has been compared to methadone in several clinica l studies and reviewed in m ultiple meta-analyses. Overall, studies have demonstrated that buprenorphine-based the rapy was as effective as methadone in the management of opioid dependence ( Farre et al 2002, Gibson et al 2008, Go wing et al 2017, Johnson et al 1992, Kamien et al 2008, Law et al 2017, Meader et al 2010, Perry et al 2013, Petitjean et al 2001, Soyka et al 2008, Strain et al 2011). However, when low doses of bupreno rphine were studied ( 8 mg/d ay), high doses of methadone ( 50 mg/day) proved to be more efficacious (Farre et al 2002, Ling et al 1996, Ma ttick et al 2014, Schottenfeld et al 1997 ). In a 24-week, Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, random ized controlled trial (N = 504 ), the efficacy and safety of multiple SC injections of bupren orphine (100 mg and 300 mg) ove r 24 weeks were assess ed in treatment-seeking patients with opioid use disord er. Buprenorphine injection was shown to be superior to placebo in achieving more illicit opioid-free weeks (p < 0.0001). T he proportion of patients achi eving treatment success (defin ed as any patient with at least 80% of urine samples negat ive for opioids combined with n egative self-repor ts for illicit opioid use from week 5 through week 24) was statistica lly significantly higher in both groups receiving buprenor phine compared to Committee Briefing Document, Haight et al 2019) . Extended-release IM naltrexone wa s film in a 24-week, open-label, randomized controlled trial (N = 570). More induction failures were seen with extended-release IM naltrexone; as a result, in the intention-to-tr eat analysis, relap se-free surviv al was lower with extended-rel ease IM naltrexone compared to sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone. However, among patients w ho were able to successfully initiate treatment, extended-release IM naltrexone had similar efficacy to buprenorphine/naloxone in terms o f relapse prevention ( Lee et al 2018 ). A 12-week, randomized, open- label, noninferiority trial (N = 159) similarly found that extended-release IM naltrexone was noninferior to o ral buprenorphine/naloxone in te rms of negative urine drug te sts and days of opioid use (Tanum et al 2017). In a meta-analysis examining the efficacy of oral naltrexone fo r maintenance treatment of opioid dependence, oral naltrexone was no better than plac ebo or no pharmacologic treat ment in terms of treatment retention or use of the primary substance of abuse. Bas ed on the results of 1 study, it was also not significantly di fferent from bup renorphine for retention, abstinence, and side effects ( Minozzi et al 2011 ). A small, randomized, open-label study (N = 60) found that patients receiving extended-release IM naltrexone were twice as likely to remain in treatment for 6 months compared to patients receiving oral naltrexone ( Sullivan et al 2019). The safety and efficacy of lofexidine for inpatient treatment o f opioid withdrawal symptoms was examined in an 8-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (N = 264). I n this study, patients treated with lofexidine had lower scores on the Short Opioid Withdr awal Scale (SOWS) Gossop scale on day 3 compared to placebo. More patients in the placebo group terminated s tudy participation early ( Gorodetzky et al 2017). Similar results were found in another placebo-controlled trial (Fishman et al 2019) . Meta-analyses have found that alt hough lofexidine reduces withd rawal symptoms compared to placebo, it is less effective than bupreno rphine for managing opioid withdrawal in terms of withdrawal severity , withdrawal duration , and likelihood of tre atment completion (Gowing et al 2016, Gowing et al 2017) . It is likely to be less effectiv e than buprenorphine or methado ne for opioid detoxification ( Meader 2010 ). Products for Emergency Treatment of Opioid The approval of Evzio auto-inject or and Narcan nasal spray were based on pharmacokinetic bioequivalence studies comparing these products to a generic naloxone product, deliver ed SC or IM. No clinical st udies were required by FDA ( Prescribing information: Evzio 2016, Narcan 2017 ). The manufacturers also conducted a human factors validation stu dy in which participants were asked to deliver a simulated dose of the drug to a mannequin without training and most demonstrated appro priate use of the device (FDA Summary Review: Evzio 2014, Narcan nasal spray 2015 ). Studies have suggested that IN naloxone is an effective option in the treatment of opioid overdose ( Kelly et al 2005, Kerr et al 2009, Merlin et al 2010, Robe rtson et al 2009, Sabzghabaee et al 2014 ). A meta-analysis of naloxone studi es found that lay administrati on of naloxone was associated with significantly increased odds of recovery comp ared with no naloxone administra tion (odds ratio, interval to 13.25) ( Giglio et al 2015 ). 206 Data as of August 20, 2019 LK-U/JA-U/KAL Page 6 of 14 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx. It is intended for internal use only and should be disseminated only to authorized recipients.

T he Content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Patients should alwa ys seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regar ding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and pub lished resources when making medical decisions. A 2-year, non-randomized interv ention study found that prescribing naloxone to patients who were prescribed long-term opioids for chronic pain was asso ciated with a 47% decrease in opioid-related emergency visits per month after 6 months and a 63% decrease after 1 year compared to those who di d not receive naloxone ( Coffin et al 2016 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES The American Academy of Pediatri cs (AAP), APA, A SAM, CSAT/U.S. SAMHSA, and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have pub lished guidelines for the treatmen t of opioid dependence. In general, these guidelines support access to pharmacologic al therapy for the management of opioid dependence. Buprenorphine/naloxone combination products may be used for induction and maintenance. In pregnant women for whom buprenorphine therapy is selected, buprenorphine alone (ie, without naloxone) is reco mmended. Naltrexone may be considered for the prevention of relapse, although outcomes with this medication a re often adversely affected by poor adherence. Extended-release injectable naltr exone may reduce, but not eliminate, some of the problems with oral naltrexone adherence. The VHA guideline recommends extended-release inject able naltrexone if opioid agonist treatment is not feasible; it does not recommend for or against oral naltrexone (CSAT 2004, CSUP 2016, Kampman 2015, Kleber et al Kraus et al 2011, SAMHSA 2019, VHA 2015 ). Clinical practice guidelines f rom ASAM and VHA recommend agains t withdrawal management alone due to the high risk of relapse compared with treatme nt with maintenance therapy. Ho wever, opioid withdrawal can be managed with either gradually tapering doses of opioid agonists or use of alpha-2 medications VHA 2015). Use of tapered doses of opioid agonists has been shown to be su perior to alpha-2 adrenergic agonists in terms of retention and opioid abstinence . However, the use of non-opioid medications may be the onl y option available to clinicians in some healthcare s ettings and may also facilitate the transition of pati ents to opioid antagonist medications (eg, naltrexone) and help prevent subsequent relaps e. Various organization s including the WHO and the ASAM have endor sed the availability o f naloxone for patients, bystanders, and first responders for the emergency management of suspected opioid overdose. It is recommended that people who are likely to witness an overdose shoul d have access to and be trained in the use of naloxone ( Kampman 2015, WHO 2014 ). According to the WHO guidelines for community management of opi oid overdose, nalox one is effective when delivered by IV, IM, SC , and IN routes of adm inistration. Perso ns using naloxone should select a route of administration based on the formulation available, their skills in administration, the setting, and local context. SAFETY SUMMARY Products for Treatment of Opioid Dependence Buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone products are contraind icated in with kno wn hypersensitivity to the active ingredients. Buprenorphine products have sever al warnings and precautions, including: abuse potential ; respiratory treatment; hepatitis and hepatic events; hyper sensitivity reactions; precipitation of opioid withdraw al signs and symptoms; use in patients with impaired hepatic function; impairment of ability to drive or operate machi nery; orthostatic hypotension; elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure; elevation intracholedochal pressure; and effects in acute abdominal condi tions. Concomitant use of buprenorphine with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increase s the risk for adverse events, including overdose, respi ratory depression, and death. Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most c ases of concomitant use. This additional warning was added to opioid products in February 2018 after data demonstr ated an increased risk of mort ality in patients ng benzodiazepines while on opioid maintenance treatment ( FDA Drug Safety Communication 2017 ). The buprenorphine SC injection also has several unique warnings and precautions, including: s erious harm or death if administered IV (boxed warning); r isks associated with treatmen t of emergent acute pain; use in patients at risk for arrhythmia. In the treatment of addiction invo lving opioid use in pregnant women, the buprenorphine/ naloxone combination product is not recommended for use (insufficient evidence); how ever, the buprenorphine monoproduct is a reasonable and recommended option for use. 207 Data as of August 20, 2019 LK-U/JA-U/KAL Page 7 of 14 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Similar to other opiate products , these products may increase i ntracholedochal pressure, increase cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and obscure diagnosis or exacerbate acute abdominal s ymptoms. These products should not be used as analgesics. The most common adverse reactions observed with buprenorphine a nd buprenorphine/naloxone products include headache, insomnia, nausea, pain, sweating, and withdrawal synd rome. All of the buprenorphine-containing products have an associated risk evaluation and miti gation strategy (REMS) program ( REMS@FDA 2019 ). Lofexidine has several warning s and precautions, including: ris k of hypotension, bradycard ia, and syncope; risk of QT prolongation; increased risk of CNS depression with concomitant use of CNS depressant drugs; and increased risk of opioid overdose in patients who complete opioid discontinuation and resume opioid use. Sudden discontinuation of lofexidi ne can cause a marked rise in blood pressure and sympto ms that include diarrhea, insomnia, anxiety, chills, hyper hidrosis, and extremity pain. L ofexidine should be discontin ued by gradually reducing the dose. The most common adverse reactions observed with lofexidine include orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, hypotension, dizziness, The safety of lofexidine in pr egnancy has no t been established. Naltrexone products ar e contraindicated in : patients receiving opioid analgesics; patients currently dependent on opioids (including those currently maintai ned on opioid agonists); patients in acute opioid withdrawal; individuals who have failed a naloxone challenge test or hav e a positive urine screen for o pioids; individuals with a history of sensitivity to naltrexone or other components of the prod uct; and individuals with acute hepatitis or liver failure (oral naltrexone only). Extended- release injectable naltrexone component of the diluent. Naltrexone can precipitate withdrawal if given to an patient. Prior to initi ating naltrexone, an opioid- free interval of 7 to 10 days is r ecommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids; patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdraw al symptoms for up to 2 weeks. A naloxone challenge tes t may be helpful to determine whether or not the patient has had a sufficient opioid- free period prior to initiating naltrexone. Patients may be more vulnerable to opioid overdose after discon tinuation of naltrexone du e to decreased opioid tolerance. Monitor patients on naltrexone fo r the development of depression or suicidality. Warnings unique to extended-releas e IM naltrexone include: inje pneumonia; hypersensitivity reactions, including a use thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder; and inte rference with certain immunoa ssay methods of urine opioid detection. The most common adverse reactions observed with oral naltrexone include difficulty sleeping, anxiety, nervousness, abdominal pain/cramps, nausea/vomiting, low energy, joint and muscle pain, and headache. The most common adverse reactions observed with extended-release IM naltrexone include hepatic enzyme abnormalities, injection site pain, nasopharyngitis, insomnia, and toothache. There are no adequate and well- controlled studies of naltrexone in pregnant women; it should be used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Extended-release IM naltrexone has a REMS program due to the ri sk of severe injection site reactions ( REMS@FDA 2019 ). Products for Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose These products are contraindicated in patients with hypersensit ivity to naloxone or to any of the other ingredients. These products carry warnings and precautions for risks of recurrent respiratory and CNS dep ression, limited efficacy with partial thdrawal symptoms in pendent including anxiety, tachycardia, sweating, piloerection, yawning , sneezing, rhinorrhea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increased blood pressure, and abdominal or muscle cramps. Opioid withdrawal signs and symptom s in neonates also include convulsions, excessive crying, and hyperactive reflexes. 208 Data as of August 20, 2019 LK-U/JA-U/KAL Page 8 of 14 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

See the current prescribing in formation for full details CONCLUSION Products for Treatment of Opioid Dependence used for the tr eatment of opioid dependence. Some products are indicated for maintenance treatment only, while others are indi cated for both inducti on and maintenance. Buprenorphine is suggested as a first-line maintenance treatmen t for opioid use disorder; i t may be preferred over methadone because it is safer and does not require clinic-based treatment. Buprenorphine is typically administered in a combination product with naloxon e, an opioid antagonist, to discourage abuse. These agents are Schedule III controlled substances ( Strain 2019 ). Clinical trials have demonstrat ed that buprenorphine/naloxone is practical and safe for use in diverse community treatment settings including primary care offices ( Amass et al 2004, Fiellin et al 2008 ). Physicians prescribing buprenorphine for opioid dependency must undergo specialized training due to the potential for abuse and diversion. Because of th ese risks, buprenorphine mono therapy should be reserv ed for patients who are pregnant or have a document ed allergy to naloxone ( DATA 2000, CSAT 2004 ). Overall, studies have demonstrated that buprenorphine-based the rapy was as effective as methadone in the management of opioid dependence ( Farre et al 2002, Gibson et al 2008, Go wing et al 2017, Johnson et al 1992, Kamien et al 2008, Meader et al 2010, Petitjean et al 2001, Soyka et al 2008, Mattick et al 2014, Strain et al 2011 ). The most common adverse reactions observed with buprenorphine a nd buprenorphine/naloxone products include headache, insomnia, nausea, pain, sweating, and withdrawal synd rome. These products also have REMS criteria. Lofexidine is an oral central alpha-2 agonist indicated for mit igation of opioid withdrawal symptoms to facilitate abrupt opioid discontinuation. Meta-analyses have found that a lthough lofexidine reduces withdrawal symptoms compared to placebo, it is less effective than buprenorphine fo r managing opioid withdrawal in terms of withdrawal severi ty, withdrawal duration, and likelihood of treatment completion (Gowing et al 2016, Gowing et al 2017) . It is likely to be less effective than buprenorphine or methadone for opioid detoxification ( Meader 2010 ). The most hypotension, opioid antagoni st. Oral naltrexone is indicat ed for the treatment of alcohol dependence and blockade of the effects of exogenously administered opioids. Extended-re lease IM naltrexone is indic ated for the treatment of alcohol dependence the preven tion of relapse to opioid depe ndence following opi oid detoxification. In order to initiate naltrexone treatment, pat ients must be opioid-free for at least 7 to 10 days to avoid precipitation of withdrawal. In a meta-analysis examining the efficacy of oral naltrexone fo r maintenance treatment of opioid dependence, oral naltrexone was no better than plac ebo or no pharmacologic treat ment in terms of treatment retention or use of the 211 Data as of August 20, 2019 LK-U/JA-U/KAL Page 11 of 14 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Bas ed on the results of 1 study, it was also not significantly di fferent from bup renorphine for retention, abstinence, and side effects ( Minozzi et al 2011 ). Extended-release IM naltrex one has been shown to have similar efficacy to oral buprenor phine/naloxone among patients who are able to successfully initiate treatment ( Lee et al 2018, Tanum et al 2017 ). Retention rates with extended-release IM naltrexone are better than those seen with oral naltrexone ( Sullivan et al 2019 ). The most common adverse reactions observed with oral naltrexone include difficulty sleeping, anxiety, nervousness, abdominal pain/cramps, nausea/vomiting, low energy, joint and muscle pain, and headache. The most common adverse reactions observed with extended -release IM naltrexone include hepatic enzyme abnormalities, injection site pain, nasopharyngitis, insomnia, and toothache. Extended-release IM n altrexone also has a REMS program. The AAP, APA, ASAM, CSAT/SAMHSA, and VHA publish guidelines for the treatment of opioid dependence. These guidelines support access to pharmacological therapy for the management of opioid dependence. Buprenorphine/naloxone combination products may be used for ind uction and maintenance . In pregnant women for whom buprenorphine therapy is selected, buprenorphine alone (ie , without naloxone) is recommended. Naltrexone may be considered for the prevention of relapse, although outcomes with this medication are oft en adversely affected by poor adherence. Extended-release inject able naltrexone may reduce, b ut not eliminate, some o f the problems with oral naltrexone adherence. The VHA gui deline recommends extended-rel if opioid agonist treatment is not feasible; it does not recommend for or against oral naltrexone (CSAT 2004, CSUP 2016, Kampman et al 2015, Kleber et al 2006, Kraus et al 2011, SAMHSA 2019, VHA 2015). Clinical practice guidelines f rom ASAM and VHA recommend agains t withdrawal management alone due to the high risk of relapse compared with treatme nt with maintenance therapy. Ho wever, opioid withdrawal can be managed with either gradually tapering doses of opioid agonists or use of alpha-2 with other non- narcotic medications. Lofexidi ne has not been added to practice guidelines but it likely has a similar place in therapy as clonidine (Kampman 2015, VHA 2015). Products for Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Naloxone is the standard of car e to treat opioid overdose. It h as been used by medical pers onnel for over 40 years and its use outside of the medical setting has gained traction thro ugh improvements in nasa l spray are approved for treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose. Prior to the a pproval of Evzio and Narcan nasal spray, naloxone was only available in glass vials and ampules, which were distributed with syringes and needles for manual injection or with syringes and atomizers for off-label IN administration ( Evzio FDA Summary Review 2014 ). Naloxone can be IV , IM, or SC using naloxone vials /syringes as well as IM device (Evzio). Alt hough Narcan nasal spra y first IN for mulation to be FDA-approved, naloxone has historically been given IN off-label via kits containing a syringe and an at omization device. Potential adv antages of IN administration of naloxone include easier dispo sal, no needle stick risk, and avoidance of needle anxiety. B oth Evzio and Narcan nasal spray are designed for use by laypersons. The approvals of Evzio and Narcan nasal spray were based on pharma cokinetic bioequivalence studie s. No new clinical studies were requi red by the FDA. Various organization s including WHO and ASAM have endorsed the availability of naloxone fo r patients, bystanders, and first responders for the emergency management of suspected opioid overdose. It is reco mmended that people who are likely to witness an overdo se should have access to and be trained in the use of naloxone ( WHO 2014, Kampman 2015 ). According to the WHO guidelines for community management of opi oid overdose, nalox one is effective when delivered by IV, IM, SC , and IN routes of adm inistration. Perso ns using naloxone should select a route of administration based on the formulation available, their skills in administration, the setting, and local context. The U.S. HHS has recommended pres cribing or co-prescribing nalo xone to all patients opioid overdose, including: patients rece iving opioids at a dosage of 50 MME per day or greater; patients with respiratory conditions who are prescribed opioids; patients who have been prescribed benzodiazepines along with opioids; and patients prescribed opioids who have a non-opioid substance use disorder, report excessi ve alcohol use, or have a mental health disorder ( HHS 2018 ). 212 Data as of August 20, 2019 LK-U/JA-U/KAL Page 12 of 14 This information is considered c onfidential and proprietary to OptumRx.
