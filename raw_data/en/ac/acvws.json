Your search to reduce or eliminate those annoying or debilitating menopause symptoms or peri-menopausal symptoms naturally, may provide you with much greater benefit than you are currently looking for. Fuzzy thinking, hot flushes (hot flashes), insomnia and/or fatigue are serious and often debilitating symptoms that seriously interfere with normal life. But the medical options carry problems of their own, with unpleasant side effects and potentially fatal consequences. It's a problem to know what to do. Just popping along to your health shop and purchasing a bottle of herbal tablets advised by the shop assistant is more than likely to be a waste of money. Nothing may be wrong with the advice or the product. But what every woman needs is a personalised product that considers her individual symptoms and history. You'll not get this unless you consult with a specialist. A natural specialist. One who understands natural menopause relief and has experience of achieving this. In a nutshell, the following is what you may be advised, depending on the type of health care: 1 - Diet One of the first things everyone should do when they develop any malady, is to look at their diet. Following government advice, your doctors advice or what everyone else is doing, on diet is likely to lead you down a blind alley. Instead, you need to go to someone who fully appreciates our origins, what our bodies evolved on, what makes us sick. For me, one of the best people to turn to is T Colin Campbell who is a nutrition researcher. He also discovered that his original ideas were wrong and he had the courage to admit this in the face of evidence. The right nutrition gives your body the best fuel to heal itself. Without that, this is impossible. 2 - Exercise You don't have to be a gym junky to get the exercise you need. Walking regularly, yoga, Tai Chi or Qigong (Chi Gung) are probably more beneficial. You simply need to move. And including some weight bearing exercise will keep your bones strong. So don't let those men in your life always carry the heavy loads. Whatever it is you choose to do, do it regularly and make sure your enjoy it. If it is a chore, you will quickly relapse into old habits. 3 - Life Style If your work or home life are pockets of stress and poor relationships, then you can't expect your health to be good. No menopause medication will help you. Instead you need to work on the problems. This may be easy or incredibly difficult, but taking the first step is a start. 4 - Natural Health Care Support Getting professional support is essential. The woman of a family is often the matriarch. If she is anxious or suffering, the whole family is also likely to be so. When she is happy and healthy, this is often reflected in the whole family. Consulting with a [homeopath](https://perthhomeopath.com/help-options) is likely to provide you with the healthiest and deepest solutions. Homeopathy works to re-store your innate ability to heal yourself. It is gentle, deep acting, supports your immune system and has no nasty effects. The beauty of it, is that it deals with the whole of you, not just your menopause fatigue or other symptoms. So other areas become healthier, including your emotional and mental side to life. To heal one aspect of your health, the whole of you needs to come into greater balance. The most thorough, the most supportive, the most strikingly effective therapy for any form of health issue can be homeopathy. So use it as your natural menopause relief. It holds the greatest potential for any and every health condition. "}
