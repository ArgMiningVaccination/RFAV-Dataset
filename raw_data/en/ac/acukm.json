One major concern for subunit vaccine application is the weak immune responses induced by protein or peptides. Developing novel and effective vaccine adjuvants are critical for the success of subunit vaccines. Here we explored the potential ofheat-inactivated MVA (heat-iMVA) as a vaccine adjuvant. Heat-iMVA dramatically enhances T cell responses and antibodies responses, mainly toward Th1 immune responses when combined with protein or peptide-based immunogen. The adjuvant effect of Heat-iMVA is stronger than live MVA and is dependent on the cGAS/STING-mediated cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway. In atherapeutic vaccination neoantigen peptide vaccine, Heat-iMVA signi cantly extended the survival and delayed tumor growth. When combined with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, Heat-iMVA induced more robust spike-speci c antibody production and more potent neutralization antibodies. Our results support that Heat-iMVA can be developed as a safe and potentvaccine adjuvant for subunit vaccines against cancer or SARS-CoV-2. npj Vaccines (2022) 7:120 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-022-00542-5 INTRODUCTION Vaccination is one of the most ef cient strategies to prevent infectious diseases, to control a pandemic such as COVID-19, andto avert or eliminate cancers associated with a viral infection suchas human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical cancer. Vacci-nation with live vaccinia virus (VACV) or the highly attenuatedmodi ed vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) generated robust and durable immune responses, which led to smallpox eradication ofcially announced by WHO in 1980 during the 33rd World Health Assembly 1, and possible persistent protection in previously vaccinated individuals2. Although the mechanisms of live atte- nuated vaccine (LAV)-mediated protective immune responses arenot entirely understood, it is accepted that innate immune-sensing mechanisms of dendritic cells activated by LAVs play anessential role in shaping adaptive immunity 3. In addition to LAVs and viral vector- or nucleic acid-based vaccines, subunit vaccination based on recombinant protein or peptides as antigens is another widely used vaccination platform.These include licensed vaccines against in fluenza virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), HPV, varicella-zoster (VZV), and many other patho-gens 4. Furthermore, discoveries of cancer neoantigens generated by somatic mutations in cancer cells, have brought excitementand renewed interest in cancer vaccines 5-9and personalized neoantigen peptide vaccination has shown promising results inclinical trials 6,10,11. Because recombinant protein or peptide vaccines usually generate weak immune responses, safe and effective vaccine adjuvants that boost vaccine ef cacy are urgently needed. Licensed the toll-likereceptor 9 agonist CpG 1018 In addition to TLR agonists,agents that activate the cytosolic pattern recognition receptors, for example, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists, have also been explored as vaccine adjuvants12,13. It has been postulated that vaccine adjuvants that mimic natural infectionsuch as LAV might elicit potent and durable immune responses viathe activation of innate immune-sensing pathways 14. VACV belongs to the poxvirus family, and modi ed vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is a highly attenuated vaccinia strain derived from chorioallantois vaccinia virus Ankara (CVA) morethan 500 passages in chicken embryo broblasts 15,16. MVA is a safe and effective vaccine against smallpox and monkeypox and aviral vector against other infectious agents 16-24. We and others have previously shown that VACV infection of bone marrow- derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) fails to induce type I IFN production. By contrast, MVA infection the host immune system27-29. Inactivation of VACV or MVA, by heating VACV or MVA at 55 \u00b0C for 1 h, reduces infectivity by more than 1000-fold and much more potently induces type I IFN productionthan viruses MVA or inacti- vated MVA has the potential used as vaccine adjuvant. Based on its safety and immune-stimulating features, we hypothesized thatthe heat-inactivated VACV or MVA could act as vaccine adjuvantbecause: (i) it mimics natural infection except for lost replicationcapacity; (ii) it induces type I IFN production in cDCs via the cGAS/STING pathway and in pDCs via the TLR9/TLR7/MyD88 path- way 31,32; (iii) immunosuppressive genes type MVA (heat-iMVA) infected cells. 1Dermatology Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.2Laboratory of RNA Molecular Biology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA.3Immuno-oncology service, Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.4Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.5Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.6Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.7Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.8Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.email: dengl@mskcc.orgwww.nature.com/npjvaccines Published in partnership with the Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences 1234567890():,;Here, we show that heat-iMVAm is a stronger vaccine adjuvant than live MVA and it can boost the T and B cell responses of subunit vaccines. Furthermore, co-administration of heat-iMVA with tumor neoantigen peptides delays tumor growth and prolongs mouse survival in a syngeneic B16-F10 melanoma model. Co-delivery of heat-iMVA with enhances the production of spike-speci c neutralizing antibodies. In summary, our results provide proof-of-concept for heat-iMVA as a vaccine adjuvant against infectious diseases and cancers. RESULTS Co-administration of chicken ovalbumin with heat-iMVA enhances the generation of ovalbumin-speci c cellular and humoral immune responses in mice We have previously shown that compared with live MVA, heat- inactivation of MVA results in stronger induction I IFN and proin flammatory cytokines via the the synthase/stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS/STING) pathway in DCs 25,31. In addition, intratumoral (IT) delivery of heat-iMVA generates stronger antitumor immunity than live MVA in immune-competent murine tumor models25,31. Here, we hypothesized that heat-iMVA could be used as a vaccine adjuvant to boost antigen-speci c cellular and humoral immune responses in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we rst prime- immunized mice intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC) with the ovalbumin 10 \u00b5g) with or without MVA (107pfu) or heat-iMVA (an equivalent of 107pfu), followed by a boost-immunization two weeks later, and euthanized them one week after the boost vaccination, with spleens and blood subsequently collected and assessed for OVA-speci c T-cells and antibodies. To determine anti-OVA CD8+T-cell incubated class I (Kb)-restricted peptide epitope of OVA for 12 h, followed by staining with anti-CD8 and anti-IFN- antibodies. To test class II I-Ad-restricted peptide epitope of OVA for 12 h, followed by staining with anti-CD4 and anti-IFN- antibodies. IM administration of IFN- +CD8+T-cells and anti-OVA IFN- with OVA alone, while OVA plus live MVA had minimal effect on the generation of OVA-speci c T cells in the spleens. The percentages of IFN- +T-cells among splenic CD8+T-cells increased 0.1% among splenic CD4+T-cells from 0.05; n=5; Fig. 1a, b). Although the combination of OVA plus live MVA modestly enhanced the production of OVA-speci c IgG1 and IgG2c compared with OVA alone, OVA plus heat-iMVA induced stronger IgG1 and IgG2c production than OVA alone or OVA plus live MVA (Fig. 1e). IgG2c antibody titers were upregulated by 100-fold in the heat-iMVA than OVA alone ( P< 0.001; n=5; Fig. suggesting that heat- iMVA induced stronger Th1 immune responses. Subcutaneous (SC) vaccination with OVA plus heat-iMVA resulted in more potent OVA-speci c CD8 +or CD4+T cell responses and higher titers of OVA-speci c IgG1 and IgG2c than OVA alone or OVA plus live MVA (Fig. 1c, d, f). Together, these results indicate that heat-iMVA can be used as a vaccine adjuvant to enhance both cellular and humoral Th1-biased immuneresponses.Heat-iMVA promotes more robust Th1 responses and IgG2c production compared with complete Freund adjuvant (CFA) and AddaVax Next, we compared the adjuvanticity of heat-iMVA with other well- known vaccine adjuvants. For example, CFA comprises heat-killedMycobacterium tuberculosis in non-metabolizable oils (paraf no i l and mannide monooleate) and also contains ligands for TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9. Injection of antigen with CFA induces a Th1-dominantimmune response 37.A l t h o u g hC F A 's use in humans is currently impermissible due to its toxicity pro le, it is commonly used in animal studies because of its strong adjuvant effects. To test whether heat-iMVA is superior to CFA, we prime-vaccinated mice SC with OVA plus heat-iMVA or OVA plus CFA followed by a boost-vaccination two weeks later. Subsequently, we harvested spleens, dLNs, and blood one week after the boost-vaccination to analyze anti-OVA CD8 +and CD4+T-cell and antibody responses. SC administration of OVA plus heat-iMVA induced higher levels of antigen-speci cC D 8+and CD4+T-cells than OVA plus CFA in the spleens of vaccinated mice. The percentage of IFN- +T-cells among CD8+T-cells in the spleens increased from 0.77% in the OVA-treated mice to 1.7% in OVA +heat-iMVA-treated mice as opposed to 1.2% in OVA +CFA-treated mice ( P<0 . n=5; The CD4+ in the spleens increased from in the OVA-treated mice to 1.9% in OVA +heat-iMVA-treated mice as opposed to 1.0% in OVA+CFA group ( P<0 . 0 0 1 n=5; OVA +heat-iMVA vs. OVA + CFA; Fig. 2b). We also observed that serum IgG1 titers from OVA+CFA-immunized mice were 6-fold higher than the serum from OVA +heat-iMVA-immunized mice ( P<0 . 0 1 2c), whereas serum IgG2c titers from OVA +CFA-immunized mice were 10-fold lower than those in the serum of OVA +heat-iMVA-immunized mice ( P<0 . 0 2d). IgG1 whereas IgG2c considered a \"Th1-like \"isotype. These results indicate that co-administration of OVA plus Heat-iMVA promotes stronger Th1-biased humoral immunity than OVA plus CFA. MF59, a squalene-based oil-in-water vaccine adjuvant in the inactivated in fluenza vaccine Fluad (licensed for use in adults aged 65 and older), is also the adjuvant in subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-238. AddaVax is an MF59-like preclinical grade nano- emulsion both Th1-cellular immune responses and Th2-biased humoral responses39. Here, we observed that intra- muscular (IM) vaccination with OVA plus heat-iMVA induced CD8+ T cell responses similar to OVA plus AddaVax, however, the former combination promoted higher CD4+T cell responses than the latter (Fig. 2a, b). The percentage of IFN- +T-cells among splenic CD4+T-cells increased from 0.79% in the OVA-treated mice to 1.6% in OVA +heat-iMVA-treated mice as OVA+AddaVax; 2b). addition, IM vaccination of OVA plus n=5; +heat-iMVA vs. OVA +AddaVax; Fig. 2c), suggesting that co-administration of the antigen plus heat-iMVA more potently induces antigen-speci c Th1-biased cellular and humoral immune responses compared with combining theantigen with AddaVax. Overall, SC or IM co-administration of OVA with heat-iMVA generated similar cellular and humoral immune responses to OVA (Fig. 2a-d). Heat-iMVA-induced vaccine adjuvant effects depend on CD103 +/CD8 +DCs and the STING pathway BATF3 is a transcription factor critical for the development of CD103+/CD8 +lineage DCs, which plays an essential role in cross- presenting viral and tumor antigens40. To test whether STING or N.

Our results showed that the percentages of anti-OVA IFN- +T-cells among splenic CD8+T-cells induced by splenic anti-OVA IFN-+CD4+T-cells seemed unaffected (Fig. 3b), with minimal effects on the IgG1 and IgG2c production (Fig. 3c, d). These results support a role for Batf3-dependent CD103+/CD8 +DCs in cross- presenting OVA antigen to generate OVA-speci c splenic CD8+ T-cells in our vaccination model. STING agonist cGAMP can be used as a vaccine adjuvant41. Here, we observed that the percentage of anti-OVA IFN- +T-cells among splenic CD8+T-cells induced were reduced by 10-fold in the STINGGt/Gtmice vaccinated with OVA +heat-iMVA did not signi cantly differ between the two groups (Fig. 3c). These results demonstrate that the cGAS/STING-mediatedcytosolic DNA-sensing pathway plays a critical role in the vaccine adjuvant effects of heat-iMVA. Heat-iMVA enhances antigen cross-presentation by BMDCs and proliferation of antigen-speci c T cells in vitro Infection of epidermal DCs with live VACV inhibits DCs 'capacity to promote the proliferation of antigen-speci c T-cells42. To test whether heat-iMVA or live MVA infection of BMDCs enhancesantigen cross-presentation and the proliferation T cells, we incubated GM-CSF-cultured BMDCs with OVA at various concentrations in the presence or absence of heat-iMVA or live MVA for 3 h. Cells were then washed to remove OVAor viruses and co-cultured with CellTrace violet (CTV)-labeled OT- T cells for 3 days. OT-I cells recognize the OVA 257-264 (SIINFEKL) peptide presented on MHC-I and proliferate under the in fluence of T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and in flammatory cytokines. OT-I cell proliferation was quanti ed by measuring CTV intensities by FACS, which showed that infection of GM-CSF-cultured BMDCswith heat-iMVA enhanced the capacity of BMDCs to stimulate theproliferation of OT-I T-cells at all tested OVA concentrations (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mg/ml), as indicated by CTV dilution in the dividing cells (Fig. 4a, b). Live MVA infection of BMDCs also promoted antigen cross-presentation and proliferation of OT-1 cells, but itwas less potent than heat-iMVA (Fig. 4a, b).

Antigen-speci c T cell and antibodies responses were measured after intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SC) vaccination on day 0 and day 14 with OVA (10 g) in the presence or absence of heat-iMVA (an equivalent amount of 107 pfu) in C57BL/6J mice. a,bOn day 21, splenocytes were stimulated with OVA 257-264or OVA 323-339.

We then washed away OVA and viruses and co- cultured the OVA-pulsed BMDCs with OT-1 cells for 3 days. IFN- levels in the supernatants were determined by ELISA. We observed that GM-CSF-cultured BMDCs infected with heat-iMVA were more potent in cross-presenting OVA antigen and stimulat-ing IFN- secretion from proliferated and activated OT-I cells than BMDCs infected with live MVA (Fig. 4e). However, IFN- levels were much co-cultured with OT-I cells (Fig. 4e).

The cells were then pulsed with OVA for 3 h before they were washed and co- incubated with OT-1 cells for 3 days. IFN- levels were much lower in STING-de cient CD103+DCs than WT CD103+DCs (Fig. 4f). These results indicate that the cGAS/STING pathway plays a vital role in heat-iMVA-induced, CD103+DCs-mediated antigen cross- presentation and antigen-speci c T cell proliferation and activation. Heat-iMVA infection of BMDCs does not increase phagocytosis of soluble antigen Infection of BMDCs with heat-iMVA induces DC maturation that is dependent on the STING-mediated cytosolic DNA-sensing path-way 25. To assess whether BMDCs 'capacity for uptake of fluorescent Alexa Fluor 647-labeled model antigen OVA (OVA- 647) is affected by heat-iMVA treatment, BMDCs were infected Fig. 3 CD103+DC and the C57BL/6J mice were intramuscularly vaccinated on day 0 and day 14 with OVA (10 \u00b5g) +heat-iMVA (an equivalent of 107pfu). a,bOn day 21, mice were euthanized, and spleens and blood were collected. splenocytes were stimulated with OVA 257-264or OVA 323-339.

Data are representative of three independent experiments.N. Yang et al. 5 Published in partnership with the Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences npj Vaccines (2022) 120 with heat-iMVA (with an equivalent MOI of 1) for 1 h and then incubated with OVA-647 for 1 h. The fluorescence intensities of phagocytosed OVA-647 in BMDC were then measured flow cytometry, showing that pre-incubation of BMDCs with heat-iMVAfor 1 h did not affect their capacity to phagocytose OVA-647 (Supplemental Fig. 1a, b). These results indicate that upon heat- iMVA infection didn 't increase phagocytosis of soluble antigen in BMDCs. N. Yang et al. 6 npj Vaccines (2022) 120 Published in partnership with the Sealy Institute for Vaccine SciencesHeat-iMVA infection of BMDCs induces STING-dependent IFN and in flammatory cytokine responses To probe host transcriptomic changes induced by live MVA or heat-iMVA infection of BMDCs and to assess the contribution ofthe STING-mediated cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway in this process, we performed RNA-seq analyses of BMDCs from WT and STING Gt/Gtmice infected with either live MVA or heat-iMVA for 2, 4, and 6 h. Our results showed several patterns of geneexpression induced by MVA and heat-iMVA: (i) Infection with liveMVA, but not heat-iMVA, induced a subset of host genes in aSTING-independent manner, thus indicating gene induction by alive virus infection (Supplemental Fig. 2a, marked as a1-2); (ii) Heat-iMVA induced higher levels of a large subset of IFN-regulated genes than live MVA, which were mainly dependent on STING(Supplemental Fig. 2a, marked as b1-3); and (iii) Heat-iMVAinfection induced higher levels of a relatively small subset ofgenes than MVA, which were independent of STING (Supple-mental Fig. 2a, marked as c). Selected examples of genes in eachcategory are shown (Fig. 4g and Supplemental Fig. 2b). For example, heat-iMVA infection triggered higher levels of binding protein (Gbp) family, as largelydependent on STING (Supplemental Fig. 2b, marked as b). Theseresults indicate that the activation of the cytosolic DNA-sensingpathway triggers the up-regulation of genes involved in thecytosolic RNA-sensing pathway in addition to other antiviral genes, thereby strengthening host defense against viral invasion. MVA infection of BMDCs resulted in the temporal expression of viral RNAs, as shown by the unbiased hierarchical cluster analysis (Supplemental Fig. 2c). Our results demonstrated that a large set of genes are expressed early during infection, consistent withpublished results of RNAseq of VACV-infected HeLa cells 43.B y contrast, heat-iMVA infection of cDCs did not result in signi cant levels of viral transcripts detected by the RNA-seq method(Supplemental Fig. 2c). Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA)conrmed IFN- , STING-de cient (Fig. RNA-seq analyses showed that MVA and heat-iMVA infection trigger distinctivehost and viral transcriptomic pro les in DCs, and that heat-iMVA is more immune-stimulatory likely due to the lack of expression ofviral inhibitory genes. In addition, heat-iMVA-induction of type IIFN and IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) is largely dependenton STING. Heat-iMVA promotes migratory DC traf cking and maturation of resident DCs in the draining lymph nodes The DC lineage is heterogeneous and composed of migratory and resident DCs 44. Migratory DCs capture antigens in the peripheral tissue and then mature, followed by migration to the draining lymph nodes, where they present antigens to na\u00efve T cells. They canalso transfer some antigens to resident DCs 45,46. To elucidate the contributions of skin DC subsets in heat-iMVA-induced immuneresponse, we analyzed various DC populations in skin draininglymph nodes after vaccination using a similar gating strategy as reported 47.F i r s t ,w ew e r ea b l et oc o n rm six distinct DC populations in the skin draining lymph nodes (dLNs): (i) MHC- +CD11c+ migratory DCs and Langerin+DCs, which are CD103+DCs and and CD8 lymphoid-resident which DCs subsets ef ciently phagocytosing OVA antigen labeled with an Alexa Fluor 647 dye (OVA-647) and have thecapacity to migrate to the skin dLNs. We intradermally injected OVA-647 into the right flanks of mice and harvested the skin dLNs at 24 h post injection. Consistent with a previous report showing that migratory DCs are responsible for transferring antigens to skin draining LN 48, we observed that OVA-647 was mostly found in the three types of migratory DCs, including CD11b+,C D 1 0 3+,a n d CD11bCD103DCs, but rarely detected in resident DCs (Fig. 5a). To compare whether co-administration of OVA-647 with or withoutheat-iMVA affects OVA-647 +uptake by the migratory DCs and potential transfer to resident DCs in the skin dLNs, we intradermally injected OVA-647 with or without heat-iMVA and OVA-647 skin dLNs. Co-administration OVA-647 with heat- iMVA increased the D 1 0 3+, CD11bCD103, and CD8 +DCs, injection of ( P<0 . 0 5 ; n=5; OVA +Heat-iMVA vs. OVA, Fig. 5b, c). These results suggest that co-administration of OVA-647 with heat- iMVA enhances the capacity of migratory DCs to transportphagocytosed antigen to the skin dLNs and facilitates the antigentransfer from migratory DCs to CD8 +DCs, a lymphoid-resident DC population critical for antigen cross-presentation. We also evaluated DC maturation status in the skin dLNs using CD86 as a maturation marker. Migratory DCs expressed higher levels of CD86 than resident DCs (Fig. 5d, e). Moreover, intradermal vaccination with OVA plus induced of CD86 on resident DCs (CD8 +DC or CD8DC) than with OVA alone (Fig. 5e, f). By contrast, heat-iMVA co-administration did not change the maturation status of migratory DCs entering skin draining LNs (Fig. 5e). Our results indicate that intradermal co- administration of heat-iMVA with OVA antigen promotes antigen-carrying migratory DCs traf cking into the skin draining LN transferring of antigens from migratory DCs to CD8 +DCs and induce resident DC maturation. These effects contribute to heat-iMVA 's ability to induce antigen-speci c adaptive immune responses. Co-administration of tumor neoantigen peptides with heat- iMVA improves antitumor effects in a murine therapeutic vaccination model Tumor neoantigens are promising treatment targets, and neoantigen-based cancer vaccines have been intensively investi-gated in preclinical studies and clinical trials 49. However, vaccina- tion with neoantigen peptides alone induces only weak immune responses, thus limiting this approach. To overcome this weakvaccination ef ciency, mRNA-based neoantigen shown someFig. 4 Heat-iMVA promotes OT-I cell activation and proliferation mediated by OVA cross-presentation by dendritic cells in vitro. a-dProliferation of the or absence of MVA or heat-iMVA.

Yang et al. 7 Published in partnership with the Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences npj Vaccines (2022) 120 success5,6. Here, we tested whether therapeutic vaccination with neoantigen peptides plus heat-iMVA would delay tumor growth in a murine B16-F10 melanoma model. Three days after B16-F10 co-administered melanomaneoantigen peptides (M27, M30, and M48) plus heat-iMVA three times, three days apart, and monitored tumor growth and mouse survival (Fig. 6a). Neoantigen peptides alone only minimally delayed tumor growth, with an extended median survival from 25 days in the PBS group to 28 days in the peptides alone group (P< 0.05; n=10; peptides vs. PBS, Fig. 6b-d). However, co- of neoantigen peptides with heat-iMVA cured B16- F10 melanoma in 30% of treated mice and prolonged the median survival from 28 days in the peptides alone group to 41 days in thepeptides +heat-iMVA group ( P< 0.0001; n=10; 6b, e). Likewise, co-administration of poly(I:C) (50 g) with neoantigen peptides also improvedtherapeutic ef cacy with potency similar to heat-iMVA (Fig. 6b, d, f). We did, however, observe side effects, including weight loss in the poly(I:C) group (but not with heat-iMVA), likelydue to systemic in flammatory responses to poly(I:C). These results indicate that heat-iMVA could be a safe and potent vaccine adjuvant that eradicates or delays tumor growth in a murine therapeutic vaccination model. Co-administration of heat-iMVA with SARS-CoV2 spike protein promotes robust neutralizing antibody production Effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to control the global pandemic of COVID-19 in developing nations 50.

Data are representative of two independent experiments.N. Yang et al. 9 Published in partnership with the Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences npj Vaccines (2022) 120 heat-iMVA increased IgG1 levels by 50-fold and IgG2c levels by 100-fold compared with vaccination with spike protein alone (Fig.7a, b). Although MVA also boosted spike-speci c IgG responses, the IgG1 and IgG2c levels were lower than those induced by heat- iMVA (Fig. 7a, b). To investigate whether vaccination-induced antibodies could block SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a neutralization assayusing a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Without any pretreatment, theSARS-CoV-2 GFP efciently infected ACE2-expressing HEK293T cells, as from the spike alone group only weakly reduced pseudovirus infection (Fig. 7c). Flow cytometry analysis of GFP+ rmed our observation (Fig. 7d). Serum neutralizingantibody titers in the two vaccination groups and a PBS-mock vaccination group was determined (Fig. 7d, e). ID50 (50% inhibitory dose) was de ned as the reciprocal of the serum dilution that caused a 50% reduction of GFP+cells compared with mock-treated samples. The serum neutralizing antibody titers(ID50) from spike +heat-iMVA group were 10-fold higher than those from the spike alone group (Fig. 7f). Overall, our results indicate that heat-iMVA boosts the production of neutralizing antibodies when combined with the recombinant spike proteinfrom SARS-CoV-2. DISCUSSION In this study, we explored the use of heat-iMVA as a vaccine adjuvant for protein- or peptide-based subunit vaccines againstcancers and infectious agents. MVA is an approved vaccine against Fig. 7 Heat-iMVA promotes stronger Th1 responses and IgG1, IgG2c production after intramuscular (IM) vaccination with SARS-CoV2 full length spike protein.

Yang et al. 10 npj Vaccines (2022) 120 Published in partnership with the Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciencessmallpox, and a potential viral vector with an excellent safety prole. A typical feature of MVA is that, comparing to CVA, its ancestor, and other VACV strains, it has lost immunosuppressive genes that allow stimulation of innate immunity. However, it stillexpresses some immune-suppressive genes, such as E3L. We havepreviously shown that heat-inactivated vaccinia enters DCs via its entry-fushion complex composed of multiple vaccinia proteins including A28 30. Similar to heat-inactivated vaccinia virus, Heat- iMVA most likely preserves the ability to enter DCs, but fails toexpress viral genes, thus inducing much higher levels of type I IFN and ISGs than live MVA via the cGAS/STING-mediated cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway. Here, we demonstrated that co-administration of heat-iMVA with soluble proteins or peptidesgenerates Th1-biased cellular and humoral immune responses superior to known adjuvants, including CFA and AddaVax. In a murine therapeutic vaccination model, co-delivery of heat-iMVAwith three B16-F10 neoantigen peptides delayed tumor growth and cured 30% of tumor-bearing mice, with similar ef cacy as poly(I:C), but with less toxicity. Furthermore, vaccination with heat-iMVA plus SARS-CoV-2 spike protein potently induced neutralizingantibodies. Taken together, our results support the use of heat- iMVA as a vaccine adjuvant. DCs are essential for priming na\u00efve T cells to generate adaptive immune responses, and therefore are the primary targets ofvaccine adjuvants 14,53-56. RNA-seq analyses of host transcriptomes of either live MVA or heat-iMVA revealed heat- iMVA as a more potent STING agonist than live MVA, inducinglarge subsets of genes involved in type I and type II IFN and inflammatory responses. We surmise that viral DNA from heat- inactivated MVA virion particles are detected by the cytosolic DNAsensor cGAS leading to the production of second messenger cyclicGMP-AMP (cGAMP), which then activates the STING pathway 31. We previously showed that heat-iMVA infection of BMDCs induced DC maturation in a STING-dependent manner31. Con- sistent with this, we now nd that heat-iMVA infection of BMDCs promotes antigen cross-presentation, which requires STING. Barnowski et al.57showed that the STING pathway contributes to the generation of VACV immunodominant B8-speci c CD8+T cell, but not to cell responses, after intraper- itoneal vaccination with MVA expressing OVA. Together, these results show that the STING pathway is involved in MVA-induced antiviral adaptive immunity as well as the MVA-mediated adjuvanteffect. Using Batf3 /mice, we also demonstrated that heat-iMVA- boosted antigen-speci c CD8+T cell responses are dependent on cDC1s, also known as CD103+/CD8 +DCs. However, heat-iMVA- boosted antigen-speci c CD4+T cell responses were not lost in Batf3/mice, suggesting that cDC2s, also known as CD11b+DCs, might be responsible for antigen presentation via MHC-II.Interestingly, heat-iMVA-boosted antigen-speci c antibody responses were not affected in Batf3 /mice. This nding is consistent with a recent report that migratory CD11b+DCs (cDC2s) are required for priming T follicular of CD4 +T cells, for antigen-speci c antibody production58. An increasing body of evidence indicates that STING agonists can function as potent vaccine adjuvants12,13,41,59-61. To probe the role of the STING-mediated cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway inheat-iMVA adjuvanticity, we used STING Gt/Gtmice, which lack functional STING62. Our results demonstrate that STING con- tributes to the generation of antigen-speci c IFN- +CD8+and CD4+T cells and IgG2c antibody production by iMVA. Given the cDC2 in mediating CD8+and CD4+T cell priming, we surmise that STING signaling in cDC1 and cDC2 might be important for heat-iMVA-inducedimmunogenicity. To further delineate the mechanisms of action of heat-iMVA as a vaccine adjuvant, we evaluated whether intradermal co-deliveryof heat-iMVA and OVA-647 (OVA-conjugated with traf cking to the dLNs compared with alone. Interestingly, heat-iMVA also increased OVA-647+CD8+DCs in dLNs. Although migratory DCs in the dLNs exhibited highCD86 expression with or without heat-iMVA as a vaccine adjuvant,heat-iMVA co-delivery resulted in higher expression CD86 onresident DCs, including both CD8 +DCs and CD8DCs. These results suggest that heat-iMVA co-administration promotes peripheral DC maturation and migration into dLNs, as well as LN- resident DC maturation. We speculate that some heat-iMVAvirions (together with OVA-647) might be transported, via the LNconduits, to the LN interior to resident DCs, as demonstrated forsubcutaneously injected VACV virus or MVA 63. IM is the most commonly used vaccination route for approved vaccines and SC has been investigated for new vaccine platformsdue to its skin-targeting effects. Therefore, they were used formost of the experiments in this study. We found that the cellar and humoral immune responses were similar between the two vaccination routes. In fact, several clinical trials comparing vaccineefcacy between IM and SC immunization also showed no signi cant difference between the two 64-66. A recent study by Ols et al. using nanoparticle vaccine administered via IM or SCroutes in rhesus macaques also did not observe signi cant differences in the magnitude and quality of adaptive immune responses, although antigen distributions differed 67. Although skin scari cation (SS) might be an ef cient vaccination route to deliver MVA68,69, we excluded this route of vaccination because SS delivery of protein or peptide antigens may not be ideal. We alsodid not include intranasal vaccination for this study due to similarconcerns, although intranasal vaccination with lyophilized MVA has been shown to generate long-lasting protective immunity 70. Because the skin dermis has enriched dendritic cell popula- tions71, we performed intradermal (ID) vaccination approach to evaluate whether co-administration of heat-iMVA with OVA influence the dynamics of antigen presentation in the skin draining LNs. Our results demonstrate that ID delivery of heat-iMVA and OVA promotes traf cking of antigen-carrying migratory DC subsets to the skin draining LNs and antigen transfer betweenmigratory DCs to the resident DCs in the skin draining LNs. We envision that heat-iMVA can be used as a vaccine adjuvant for neoantigen-based cancer vaccines based on its safety andimmunogenicity. Moreover, we demonstrate that heat-iMVA activation of STING signaling contributes to its adjuvanticity and heat-iMVA promotes antigen cross-presentation responses. N\u00f6rder et al.72investigated whether MVA could be used as a vaccine adjuvant, and they found that IM co-administration of MVA and OVA enhances the generation of antigen-speci c antibody and T cell responses. Here we provided evidence that heat-iMVA is a more potent vaccine adjuvant thanlive MVA. Future work would focus on identifying viral inhibitors ofthe cGAS/STING pathway encoded by the MVA genome improve its immunogenicityand adjuvanticity. METHODS MiceFemale C57BL/6J mice between 6 and 8 weeks of age were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and were used forvaccination experiments and for the preparation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Batf3 /mice were generated in the laboratory of Kenneth Murphy (Washington University).STING Gt/Gtmice were generated in the laboratory of Russell Vance (University of California, Berkeley). OT-1 mice were generated inN. Yang et al. 11 Published in partnership with the Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences npj Vaccines (2022) 120 the laboratory of Michael Bevan (University of Washington) and purchased from the Jackson laboratory. All mice were maintained in the animal facility at the Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute. All procedures were performed in strict accordance with therecommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute. Cell lines and primary Cells BHK-21 was cultured in Eagle 's Minimal Essential Medium (Eagle 's MEM, Life Technologies, Cat# 11095-080) containing 10% FBS, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. BHK-21 cells were regularly monitored for potential bacterialcontamination under the microscope before virus preparation. Forthe generation of GM-CSF-BMDCs, bone marrow cells (5 million cells in each 15 cm cell culture dish) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with GM-CSF (30 ng/ml, PeproTech) marrow cells (5 \u00d7 10 6cells in each well of a six- well plate) were cultured in the presence of murine Flt3L (100 ng/ ml, R & D Systems) for 7 -9 days. Cells were fed every 2 -3 days by replacing 50% of the old medium with fresh medium. HEK293Tcell line expressing human ACE2 (hACE2) were generated viruses (MLV) containing pQCXIP-hACE2-c9. Cells were selected and maintained in growth mediacontaining 2 g/ml puromycin for the selection of stably transduced cells. The murine melanoma cell line B16-F10 was originally obtained from I. Fidler (MD Anderson Cancer Center).Both cell lines were maintained in 1640 medium supple- mented with 10% FBS, 1 \u00d7 amino acids, mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 \u00b5M -mercaptoethanol, and penicillin-streptomycin. Cells with MycoAlert-Plus TMkit (Lonza). Viruses MVA and MVA-GFP viruses were kindly provided by Gerd Sutter (University of Munich) and propagated in BHK-21 (baby hamsterkidney cell, ATCC CCL-10) cells. MVA and MVA-GFP stocks were prepared in BHK21 cells. Brie fly, BHK21 cells in 15-cm plates were infected with MVA or MVA-GFP at MOI =0.1. After 2 days or when cytopathic effect became obvious, cells were detached from theplates with a cell scraper, collected, and pelleted. After three cycles of freeze-thaw of resuspended cell pellets, they were homogenized using a cup sonicator with ice water. The virusmaterials were centrifuged, and the supernatants were further 36% sucrose cushion centrifugating 17,000\u00d7 gfor min \u00b0C. The puri ed virus pellet was resuspended in cold PBS and dispensed into 0.5 ml aliquots andstored at 80 \u00b0C. Heat-iMVA was generated by incubating puri ed MVA-GFP virus (in 0.5 ml aliquots) in a 55 \u00b0C water bath for 1 h with vertexing every 15 min. To determine MVA-GFP titer, serialdilutions of virus stock were prepared, and they were used to infect BHK-21 cells in six-well plates. After 48 h, the number of GFP foci was counted under the fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer 7) and multiplied by the dilution factors to express titers as infectious units/ml. SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses were produced in HEK293T supernatants were harvested and ltered through a 0.45- and at 80 \u00b0C.Reagents Ovalbumin, poly(I:C) RayBiotech.

B16-F10 tumor neoantigen peptides were synthesized by GenScript(Piscataway, C57BL/6J mice were anesthetized and vaccinated initially on day 0 and boosted on day 14 with either OVA (10 \u00b5g) alone, OVA(10 \u00b5g) +MVA (10 7pfu) +heat-iMVA lent of 107pfu) in a volume \u00b5l intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC). Mice were euthanized on day 21. Spleens and blood were collected for analyzing OVA-speci c CD8+, CD4+, and B cell responses. In some cases, OVA proteins were mixed with CFA or AddaVax. In some cases, STINGGt/Gt, Batf3/, and age- matched OVA +heat- iMVA. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccination procedure In all, 4 -5 mice in each group were anesthetized and vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein (1 \u00b5g) alone, spike (1 or spike (1 g)+heat-iMVA equivalent of 107pfu) in a volume 100 \u00b5l intramuscularly on day 0 and boosted on day 21. Mice were euthanized on day 28. +MVA or spike +heat-iMVA-vaccinated mice were determined by ELISA. Unilateral intradermal tumor implantation and therapeutic vaccination using neoantigen peptides with or without adjuvants B16-F10 melanoma cells (5 \u00d7 10 4) in a volume of 100 \u00b5l were implanted intradermally into the shaved skin on the right flank of WT C57BL/6 J mice. On day 3, 6, and 9, 4 groups of mice (10 mice in each group) were subcutaneously vaccinated at the left flanks with B16-F10 neoantigen peptide mix (M27, M30 and M48) (100 \u00b5g with or without heat-iMVA (an equivalent of 107 pfu) or poly(I:C) (50 \u00b5g), or with PBS mock control, in a volume of 100 \u00b5l. Mice were monitored daily, and tumor sizes weremeasured twice a week. Tumor volumes were calculated according to the following formula: l(length) \u00d7 w(width) \u00d7 h (height)/2. Mice were euthanized for signs of distress or when thediameter of the tumor reached 10 mm. Flow cytometry analysis of antigen-speci c T cells in the spleens To analyze antigen-speci c T cells in the spleens, spleens from vaccinated mice was collected and processed using MiltenyiGentleMACS Dissociator. Red blood cells were lysed For intracellular peptides (OVA 257 -264or OVA 323 -339). of (BD Biosciences; 1:1000 dilution) was added and incubated for h. Cells were then treated with BD Cyto x/Cytoperm kit prior to staining with respective antibodies for flow cytometry analyses. The antibodies used for this used at 1:200. N.

Brie fly, 96-well microtiter plates (Thermo Fisher) were coated with 2.0 \u00b5g/mL of OVA (Invivogen) or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (RayBiotech) overnight 4\u00b0C. Plates were washed Tween-20 in PBS (PBST) and with 1% serum samples were two-fold serially diluted in PBST, added to the blocked plates, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h.Following incubation, plates cat# PA1-29288, 1:4000) 1 h. were washed with PBST and TMB substrate (BD Bioscience) was added. Reactions were stopped with 50 \u00b5l 2 NH 2SO4. Plates were read at OD 450 nm with a SpectraMax Plus plate reader (Molecular Devices). The antibody titer is de ned as the dilution in which absorbance is more than 2.1 times of theblank wells. Flow cytometry analysis of migratory and skin LN-resident DCs after fluorescent-labeled OVA-647 vaccination with or without heat-iMVA C57BL/6J mice were vaccinated intradermally at the right flank with either Alexa Fluor 647-labeled OVA (OVA-647, 10 \u00b5g) alone orOVA-647 (10 \u00b5g) +heat-iMVA (an equivalent of 10 7pfu) in a volume 100 \u00b5l PBS. Skin draining lymph nodes (dLNs) at the right inguinal area were harvested at 24 h post injection, digested withCollagenase D (400 U/ml, Roche Diagnostics) and DNase I (50 g/ ml, Roche Diagnostics), and analyzed by flow cytometry for OVA- 647 intensities and CD86 expression of the migratory DC andresident DC populations in the skin dLNs. The antigens and clone designations for antibodies were used at 1:200. on the BD LSR Fortessa or LSR IIflow cytometer software (version 10.5.3). RNA-seq analyses of \u00d7 10 6) from or STINGGt/Gtmice were infected with live MVA or heat-iMVA at a multiplicity ofinfection (MOI) of 10. Cells were collected at 2, 4, and 6 h post- infection. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher). Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer at the Rockefeller University GenomicsResource Center was used to assess total RNA integrity and quantity. Samples with the RNA integrity number (RIN) > 9.5 were used. Oligo(dT)-selected RNA was converted into cDNA for RNA sequencing using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kitv2 according to the instructions of the manufacturer and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform using 100 nt single-end sequencing at The Rockefeller University GenomicsResource Center. Reads were aligned against the mouse estimation of transcript abundance and differential expression analysis. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed using Euclidean distance and complete linkage for columns (samples) and rows (mRNAs).For the sake of clarity, the row dendrograms were removed from the gures. The R packages pheatmap was used for data representation. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted using the package fgsea with 1000 permutations, with reactome were infected with MVA or heat-iMVA at a MOI of 1 and then OVA was added atindicated concentrations and incubated for 3 h. Cells were washedaway from virus and OVA, and co-cultured with CellTrace for 3 days were incubated with OVA in the presence or absence of either live MVA or heat- iMVA for 3 h. Cells were washed away from OVA and virus and co-cultured with OT-1 cells (BMDC to OT-1T-cells ratio of 1:3) for3 days. IFN- levels in the supernatants were determined by ELISA (R&D). OT-1 cells were puri ed from OT-1 transgenic mice using negative selection with CD8a +T Cell Isolation Kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec). Brie fly, spleens and lymph nodes were harvested from OT-1 mice and mashed on 70- \u00b5M cell strainer. After red cell lysis, cells inMACS buffer (PBS with 0.5% bovine albumin and ltered through TCR/) was added to the cell mixture, and cells bound to the antibodies were removed using anti-biotin microbeads. Thepuried cells were resuspended pseudovirus at room temperature (RT) for 30 mins, and the mixtures were added to 293T-hACE2. Media was refreshed 2 hlater. After 48 h, cells were xed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at RT. Following three washes with PBS, the cell nucleiwere stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) in PBS for 10 min at RT. Images were captured using Zeiss Axio Observer 7 (Carl Zeiss) and analyzed with ZEN Imaging software (Carl Zeiss) and Image J (Fiji).GFP expression in pseudovirus-infected cells were determinedusing the BD LSR Fortessa flow cytometer and data software (version 10.5.3). Statistics Two-tailed Mann-Whitney Utest was used for comparisons of two independent groups in the studies. Survival data were analyzed by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.
