The possibilities are limitless \u2014 if we get it right. Earlier this year, I spoke at a TEDxFolsom conference about reimagining health care, and why it matters so much to patients, communities, and health professionals everywhere. You can watch it online at ucdavis.health/tedx . In that talk, I mentioned health care is increasingly becoming more personalized through artificial (\"augmented\") intelligence, an \"inside out\" approach (tailored at the patient's cellular or genetic level), and being \"always on,\" that is, inte - grated into peoples' daily life by the Internet of Things. Patients today expect a partner to help them with their health, when and how it's most convenient for them. This includes virtual care, at-home prescription delivery, remote monitoring, digital diagnostics and decision support, and self-service applications. After all, if I can use my phone to custom order dinner and it arrives at my door in half an hour, why can't medical care be this convenient too? We'll realize enormous benefits once we can achieve this \u2014 integrating the vast data across multiple siloed systems to improve efficiencies and the care experience for both patients and providers. We know that: \u0082More than two-thirds of patients want their care teams to ask about their own collected data and include this in decision-making while evaluating the patient's health. \u0082Hospital-at-home programs have proven effective in reducing complications, while cutting the cost of care by 30 percent or more. \u0082Automation can reduce health care operational costs by up to 30 percent. While health care is the most change-adverse industry in the country, technological change happens, no matter how hard you fight it or how little you want it. UC Davis Health's amazing work these past couple of years in the digital transformation along with our strides in patient and employee equity, hospital sustainability, employee engage - ment programs, regional partnerships, nation-leading growth and building has resulted in personal recognition more indi-cative of the work of thousands than of one. Reflecting this, I was honored and humbled to be named among the \"100 Most Influential People\" in health care by Modern Healthcare , and \"CEO of the Year\" by Press Ganey. Press Ganey works with more than 41,000 health care facilities in its mission to improve the overall safety, quality, and experience of care. It's no small wonder that UC Davis has joined an exclusive group of fewer than 20 public universities in the nation surpassing $1 billion in research funding. On top of this, U.S. News & World Report annually ranks UC Davis Medical Center as Sacramento's No. 1 hospital, and the publication ranks us among nine adult specialties and five pediatric specialties nationally. We serve more than 1.5 million patients annually as the only academic medical center between San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, and the Pacific Ocean and Salt Lake City, Utah. Over our past 152 years, from our origins as a county hospital at Stockton Boulevard and X Street to our world-class health system, people have come to understand that UC Davis Health's relationships and partnerships are firmly grounded in trust. As Stephen M.R. Covey once said, \"Trust is the new currency of our interdependent, collaborative world.\" Trust is earned each day, every day, and there is still much work to be done to build the trust it will take to successfully reimagine health care. As you'll see in this fascinating issue, UC Davis Health has many groundbreaking innovations underway to move this forward, including our new psyche - delics and neurotherapeutics institute, ways we're further increasing medical school diversity, an expanded robotic neurosurgery program, and our WellCent initiative to advance digital medicine. Please enjoy the good news! Yours in health, David Lubarsky, M.D., M.B.A., F.A.S.A. Vice Chancellor of Human Health Sciences Chief Executive Officer, UC Davis Health Reimagining health care Trailblazing research and cultivating a diverse physician workforce to improve lives Spring 20231This spring marks several notable successes for our remarkable UC Davis School of Medicine community. We continue to be a national role model in training talented, diverse physician leaders and trailblazing new research frontiers. This year, the Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research again placed our school among the nation's leading medical schools for National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding \u2014 with more than $200 million in NIH grants in 2022. U.S. News & World Report also ranked our school among the top 50 medical schools for research. Leveraging our strength in transdisciplinary research, this year the School of Medicine and College of Letters and Science collaborated to help launch the UC Davis Institute for Psyche - delics and Neurotherapeutics. The institute seeks to advance basic knowledge about the mechanisms of psychedelics and translate it into safe and effective treatments for diseases such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. In March, all 106 of our fourth-year medical students who participated in the national Match Day program were matched to prestigious residency programs across specialties. The vast majority, 82%, will stay in California after graduating in May, and 23% will remain at UC Davis Health. Most of these fourth-year students, 58%, will go into primary care programs. We are proud that these talented future primary care providers are optimally prepared to meet their patients' needs, especially those in rural and other underserved communities. This spring, the School of Medicine again ranked in the top 10 in the country for diversity, primary care and family medicine, and was 15th in psychiatry. Our school also received national recognition from the Association of American Medical Colleges and news outlets for our leadership in achieving one of the most diverse medical schools in the country. Key to our success are our many collaborative pre-med pathway programs. This includes our newest program, Avenue M, which creates a pathway from community college to medical school in order to address the shortage of primary care physicians in California's medically underserved areas. This is one of seven of our innovative pathway programs helping us to develop a physician workforce in California that better reflects the state's population, and will contribute to improving the lives of diverse communities statewide. We believe strongly in putting our school's values into action. An excellent example of this was our February School of Medicine Habitat for Humanity of Greater Sacramento 2023 Build for Unity event. It was yet another meaningful way for students, trainees, faculty, and staff from across our school to make a positive impact in the Sacramento region. Thank you for supporting our school community as we collectively reach new heights in our education, research, clinical care, and community partnership missions. Sincerely, Susan Murin, M.D., M.Sc., M.B.A. Interim Dean, UC Davis School of MedicineProfessor, Pulmonary Critical Care and Sleep Medicine We continue to be a national role model in training talented, diverse physician leaders and trailblazing new research frontiers.

We have no right to be surprised when these things (public mass violence) happen.\" Emergency medicine physician Garen Wintemute, M.D., M.P.H. , director of the UC Davis Violence Prevention Research Program, in January New York Times coverage after shootings in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay. \"I think fungi are really the coming superbugs. I think they're really the ones that are going to be problematic over the next decade. And Valley fever is going to be a key part of that. They are really here to stay. This battle is sort of just beginning.\" Infectious disease specialist George Thompson, M.D. , an expert on invasive fungal diseases, in NBC News coverage of Valley fever's spread due to climate change. \"Vaccine uptake, overall, is still insufficient. It's impor- tant to not let our guard down and believe the problem no longer exists.\" Infectious disease specialist Natascha Tuznik, D.O. , in a March WebMD special report on the future of COVID-19. \"Class struggles have a huge overlap with race.\" Mark Henderson, M.D. , associate dean for admissions and vice chair for education for the UC Davis School of Medicine, in a March STAT News feature about the school's approach to becoming one of the nation's most diverse.\"We believe that a workforce that is more reflective of our community provides better care. It's on us to create that bridge back to the community.\" Tonya Fancher, M.D., M.P.H. , associate dean for workforce innovation and community engagement at UC Davis School of Medicine, in a February AAMC feature about Avenue M. The UC Davis program supports community college students on a path to medical school.\"Traditional SSRIs will promote the growth of those cortical neurons, but they do so very, very slowly. It takes weeks to months for those neurons to grow back. That just so happens to be the exact same time frame that symptoms start to be addressed.\" David Olson, Ph.D. , director of UC Davis' new Institute for Psychedelics and Neuro- therapeutics, in a February Politico article on the potential of psychedelics as better treatments for neuropsychiatric diseases.Spring 202311 A UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center study found that close to half of cancer deaths between 2017-2019 (93,764 Californians) were associated with tobacco use \u2014 almost double what was previously estimated in a study of 2014 data. The new JAMA Network Open study researched people with one of 12 tobacco-related cancers \u2014 from lung and mouth to bladder and stomach \u2014 from 2014-2019 using data from the UC Davis-managed California Cancer Registry. A UC Davis Health study published in Science Advances shows female and male hearts respond differently to the stress hormone noradrenaline. Male and female mouse hearts responded uniformly at first after exposure, but some areas of the female heart returned to normal more quickly than the male, producing differences in electrical activity. The study may have implications for human heart disor - ders like arrhythmias and heart failure, and how different sexes respond to medications. New research published in Science has gener - ated the first comprehensive genetic map of sarcomas and identified several new impor - tant genes that, when inherited, can cause the c ancer. The first-of-its-kind study involved investigators from major sarcoma centers around the world, including UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center. The Australian-led research revealed 1 in 14 individuals with sarcoma carry a clinically important gene that explains why the cancer arose. In addition, researchers identified a previ - ously unrecognized genetic pathway specific to sarcomas.Asking patients to take a short survey on a tablet before appointments may help mental health providers identify young people at risk of psychosis, according to a UC Davis Health study. Published in J AMA Psychiatry, it found that when patients took a 21-question pre-visit survey, more than twice as many were identified at risk of psychosis compared to non-surveyed. However, screening did n ot reduce time between first psychotic symptoms and treatment. New UC Davis Health research confirms that pediatric critical care telemedicine consults with c linicians in rural and community emergency departments result in significantly fewer interfacility transfers. Authors said the study, published in JAMA Network Open , is the first randomized clinical trial assessing the impact of telemedicine consults on transfer rates compared to the current s tandard of care, telephone consultations. A new study led by UC Davis MIND Institute researchers confirms that brain development in people with autism differs from those with typical neurodevelopment. According to the study published in PNAS , these differences are linked to genes involved in inflam - mation, immunity response and neural transmis - sions; they begin in childhood and evolve across the lifespan. Understanding how the brain in a person with autism changes through- out life can provide opportunities for early intervention.

Tschannen Eye Institute Building, an innovative facility dedicated to advancing world-class eye care and offering hope for sight restoration. The four-story, 78,500-square-foot building is an addition to the existing Ambulatory Care Center, and includes dedicated space for the UC Davis Eye Center clinic and operations. It also houses the Division of Pain Medicine. The new facility will significantly increase the clinic's capacity to see ophthalmologist. Additional construction funding came from UC Davis Medical Center and other donors. In 2000, Tschannen began losing his sight to glaucoma, which can result in vision loss and blindness when untreated. In 2011, his ophthalmologist referred him to the UC Davis Eye Center, where he underwent surgery by ophthalmologist Michele C. Lim, M.D., to improve his vision and manage his glaucoma. In his remarks at a fall dedication, Tschannen said he hoped the facility would help people have better health and better lives for generations to come. He also gave special recognition to Lim, the medical director of the Eye Center, and thanked everyone for what they had done for him. Tschannen's lifetime giving totals exceed $38.5 million, making him UC Davis Health's largest individual donor. His funds have supported research on the optic nerve and glaucoma. patients, with 64 examination rooms, 24 imaging rooms, state-of-the-art equipment to assess eye health, and a special pediatric ophthalmology suite. It also houses the Eye Center's vision researchers, who have received presti - gious grants from the National Eye Institute; the facility will increase the center's capacity for clinical trials by an estimated 50 percent. Current trials offered by the center include stem cell treatment for vision loss, low-energy laser trabeculoplasty therapy for glaucoma, micropulse laser treatment for diabetic macular edema, and others.

It's the latest in a series of efforts by UC Davis Health to provide high-quality care to people who most need it and can least afford it. The new program, called Specialty Connect, embeds UC Davis Health providers into WellSpace Health's Oak Park Community Health Center, where they'll provide care to historically underserved populations. The program launched in January 2023 with a UC Davis Health rheumatologist, and planning is underway to bring additional specialty services in high demand by Medi-Cal patients such as pulmonology, gastroenterology, and pediatric subspecialties. \"UC Davis Health is proud to be part of this vital partner - ship with WellSpace Health aimed at overcoming health equity obstacles for underserved patients,\" said David Lubarsky, M.D., M.B.A., F.A.S.A., UC Davis Health CEO and vice chancellor of human health sciences. \"We've listened to patients, and we've learned they'd rather access their health care conveniently, in locations closer to home.\" \"Today we stand at the threshold of building the best spe - cialty network ever offered to people covered by Medi-Cal in the Sacramento region,\" added WellSpace Health CEO Jonathan Porteus, Ph.D., at a launch event in January. \"When we align our mission with our partners, there is no limit to what we can do for those we serve.\" Concerted effort to improve access Medi-Cal beneficiaries usually have many choices for primary care doctors throughout California, but struggle to find specialty care physicians due to low reimbursement rates. UC Davis Health, however, has made a con-certed effort in recent years to improve this access. About a third of all patients at UC Davis Health facilities are Medi-Cal beneficiaries. In addition, the health system offers its specialists to Medi-Cal patients at the medical center campus and clinics around the commu - nity. It also assigns providers to work in several FQHCs where tens of thousands of Sacramen - to's Medi-Cal patients already receive care closer to home or to public transit. UC Davis Health providers at the county's health center come from internal medicine, family and community medicine, pediatrics and behavioral health departments, and the Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing. The School of Medicine also has training programs there for students and residents. Specialty care provided to Medi-Cal patients at the Sacramento County Primary Care Center includes women's health, rheumatology, cardiology, nephrology, sports medicine, behavioral health, and developmental behavioral pediatrics. Program serves seven FQHCs The UC Davis Health and WellSpace Health partnership is sup - ported by Sacramento's Medi-Cal managed care health plans: Anthem Blue Cross, Molina Healthcare and Health Net; as well as participating Independent Physician Associations, including Nivano Physicians, Hill Physicians and Imperial Health. This means any Medi-Cal patient belonging to the plans, as well as patients of any of seven FQHCs, may be referred to Specialty Connect. In addition to WellSpace, the other six centers are Elica Health, Health and Life Organization (HALO), One Community Health, Peach Tree Health, the Sacramento County Primary Care Clinic, and the Sacramento Native American Health Center.Boosting specialty care access for Medi-Cal patients The Ernest E. Tschannen Eye Institute Building on the UC Davis Health Sacramento campus. \"Today we stand at the threshold of building the best specialty network ever offered to people covered by Medi-Cal in the Sacramento region. \" JONATHAN PORTEUS, CEO OF WELLSPACE HEALTHUC Davis Health14 UC Davis Health is planning a large- scale expansion of health services in Folsom, with new medical facilities and high-tech housing. The health system has purchased a 34.5-acre parcel at the intersection of East Bidwell Street and Highway 50 in Folsom Ranch. Initial plans call for an outpatient medical office building and, in the future, a micro-hospital, an ambulatory surgery center and a hotel. The new location is part of UC Davis Health's approach of providing high-quality patient-centered care close to people's homes. Folsom is growing at a rate of nearly 3% annually, and among that increase is people over the age of 65. In fact, El Dorado County, adjacent to the Folsom Ranch development, saw the largest increase of adults 65 and over. Meeting the needs of a growing populationIn addition to the new patient care facili - ties, UC Davis Health is partnering with AKT Development Corporation and Angelo K. Tsakopoulos to develop a first-in-the-world \"Community for Health and Independence\" in the region. The university-planned community will allow older people, and persons with disabilities, to live independently in technology-enabled homes designed with health care in mind. In 1998, Tsakopoulos supported the creation of the UC Davis MIND Institute. \"While we are thrilled about our medical facility expansion in Folsom, we know that the key to healthy aging for people starts in their homes,\" said UC Davis Health CEO David Lubarsky, M.D., M.B.A., F.A.S.A. \"We believe a New UC Davis Health facilities, and a proposed new community, help represent the university's commitment to healthy aging. UC Davis Health is planning to expand its facilities and services in fast-growing Folsom.Noteworthy REGIONAL GROWTH & PARTNERSHIPS reimagined community that leverages technology for human-made spaces where people live, recreate and work will promote better management of chronic disease and increase independence for valuable members of this population.\" Committed to supporting older adults Through its formal Healthy Aging initia - tive, UC Davis Health is committed to creating the healthiest and highest-functioning older adult population in Northern California via a combination of the latest technology, high-quality personal patient care, research and innovation. Technology can help indi - viduals achieve health and indepen - dence goals by staying in regular touch with care teams. \"With the expected population growth of older adults in the Folsom area and our goal of ensuring that we can meet patients wherever they are, we are confident the combination of our new campus and this new development will keep people healthier, in their own community, for much longer,\" said Thomas S. Nesbitt, M.D., M.P.H., professor emeritus and co-champion of UC Davis' Healthy Aging in a Digital World initiative. Development of the new Folsom campus will occur over a long period to accommodate innovative care delivery or equipment that may evolve, along with unique needs of Folsom residents. The outpatient clinic is slated to be first to open in 2025. UC Davis Health will implement the project within the University of California Sustainable Practices Policy, ensuring that strong levels of energy efficiency, water conser - vation, waste reduction and transporta - tion efficiency are incorporated. Expanding care in fast-growing FolsomSpring 202315 ADVANCED NEONATAL CARE FOR STOCKTON REGION UC Davis Children's Hospital has partnered with St. Joseph's Medical Center to bring nationally ranked neonatal care to premature babies in the Stockton region.

Alexopoulos comes to UC Davis Health from Vanderbilt University, where he was chief of the Division of Hepatobiliary Surgery and Liver Transplant, surgical director for adult and pediatric liver transplant programs, and cancer center faculty specializing in complex liver cancer surgery. Prior to Vanderbilt, he served as surgical director of the kidney trans - plant program at Keck Medical Center of USC, associate surgical director of the pediatric liver/intestinal transplant program at Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, and surgical director of its pediatric kidney transplant program. His extensive research portfolio includes topics such as use of machine perfusion technology to improve liver graft survival; analysis of liver trans - plant for hepatic malignancies; and optimization of liver transplant in criti - cally ill patients. Alexopoulos received his medical degree from Columbia University and completed his surgical residency at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a fellowship in abdominal transplant (multi-organ transplant and hepatobiliary) at Stanford University Medical Center. Transplant Center reaches milestone: 5,000 kidney transplants UC Davis Health reached an institutional milestone last August when it surpassed 5,000 kidney transplants performed since its first almost 37 years ago. Established in 1985, the UC Davis Transplant Center performed 282 kidney transplants in 2021, making UC Davis Health one of the top 10 centers in the nation for total kidney transplants. \"This is a testament to our dedicated team members who have helped us develop innovative ways to help patients achieve a transplant,\" said the transplant center's medical director Richard V. Perez, M.D. , who has since retired after 30 years with UC Davis Health. \"It is that dedication that has led us to be recognized as one of America's top transplant centers.\" UC Davis Health has also been selected as a model hospital by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), and chosen to guide national best practices for transplant by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. New endocrinology clinic for kidney transplant patients UC Davis Health has established a new one-stop transplant endocri - nology clinic to improve care of diabetes and other endocrinology disor - ders for kidney transplant patients, becoming one of the few hospitals nationwide with a dedicated transplant endocrinology clinic. The clinic team includes two endocrinologists \u2014 Prasanth Surampudi, M.D., asso - ciate professor of endocrinology, and Aili Guo, M.D., clinical professor of endocrinology \u2014 who monitor and manage insulin therapy for patients, since post-transplant medications make insulin and blood sugar levels difficult to control. Patients also work closely with a nutritionist to estab - lish dietary interventions. Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) affects up to 50% of kidney transplant patients, and is most commonly diagnosed during the first year after transplant.Spring 202317 Noteworthy CLINICAL TECHNOLOGY New endoscopy suite for gastroenterology, pulmonology and colorectal surgery A new outpatient endoscopy suite is open at UC Davis Medical Center as part of ongoing efforts to improve patient care and enhance technologies that result in supe - rior outcomes and experiences. The University Tower Endoscopy Suite opened last summer and caters to patients from gastroenterology, interventional pulmonology and colorectal surgery. State-of-the-art technology includes interventional gastroen - terology procedures visually aided with advanced integrated fluoroscopy suites, a 3-D mobile C-arm system, and minimally invasive biopsy of the lungs utilizing the Ion Endoluminal Robotic-Assisted Platform by Intuitive, which 3-D maps using CT.NEW ORTHOPAEDIC ROBOTIC TECHNOLOGY FOR HIP, KNEE REPLACEMENTS UC Davis Health has added the Stryker Mako SmartRobotics system as a techno - logically advanced option for hip and knee replacements that offers potential for a higher level of patient-specific implant alignment and positioning. The new approach means surgeons can create individualized 3-D plans and perform joint replacements using a surgeon-controlled robotic arm that helps execute procedures with a high degree of accuracy. Clinical studies have shown the system demonstrated the potential to offer patients several potential benefits, including reductions in pain, need for opiate pain relievers, length of hospital stay, and need for inpatient physical therapy, plus improved knee flexion and greater soft tissue protection. Orthopaedics first in region to offer weight-bearing CT scan technology The UC Davis Health Department of Orthopaedic Surgery's Sports, and Foot & Ankle Clinic is home to the first weight-bearing CT scan machine in the Northern California region. Also known as a weight bearing CT scanner, or WBCT, the innovative tech - nology allows a patient to stand for a comprehensive scan of the feet, ankles and knees; arms and hands can also be evaluated in weight-bearing position. Images can take less than 60 seconds, with less radiation exposure than traditional CT scans. WBCT imaging allows for more precise evaluation of anatomy and more accurate image of alignment, and can allow providers to observe movement that causes pain or deformi - ties. The new diagnostic tool is located at UC Davis Sports Medicine on C Street, in the same clinic where patients see orthopaedic providers. UC Davis Health has adopted low pressure insufflation as the standard for all surgical laparoscopic procedures, utilizing ConMed's AirSeal \u00ae System, becoming the first multi-site health system in the nation to implement the practice systemwide. By offering a low-pressure insufflation option for every laparoscopic procedure, surgeons can safely operate at lower intra-abdominal pressures, shown to improve patient outcomes and promote patient safety. UC Davis Health's system delivers stable pneumoperitoneum, the presence of air or gas in the abdominal cavity. It also has a valveless system which maintains optimal exposure of the operative field even with a lower pressure of insufflation and while allowing the continuous emission of surgical smoke.UC Davis Health adopts low pressure surgery systemwide \"Since 2016, we have been utilizing low pressure insufflation for our robotic sur- gery procedures and have found success in improving patient outcomes and improving operating efficiency for our robotic surgeons. We are proud UC Davis Health has made this investment to expand this benefit for all surgical laparoscopic procedures.\" BAHAREH M.

NEW PEDIATRIC DKA GUIDELINES Nicole Glaser, M.D. , professor of pediat - rics and pediatric endocrinologist at UC Davis Children's Hospital, was the lead author of clinical consensus guide - lines on the treatment of diabetic keto-acidosis (DKA) from the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD), published last October in the journal Pediatric Diabetes . The guide includes recommendations for fluid and electrolyte replacement, insulin therapy and monitoring for complications, based on currently available evidence. Noteworthy CLINICAL MILESTONESUC Davis Director of Pediatric Electrophysiology Dan Cortez, M.D., Ph.D. , is the first physician in the world to implant a retriev - able leadless pacemaker in a child. Aveir VR, manufactured byAbbott, is designed to be easily retrievable for battery replace - ment. Most traditional pacemakers are surgically implanted through the chest to the outside of the heart, then connected tothe heart by leads; this retrievable pacemaker was implantedthrough the internal jugular vein in the Cardiac Catheterization Lab and has no leads \u2014 instead, the heart absorbs it. \"No inci - sions. Just a stitch placed in the neck the day of the procedure and removed the following morning,\" Cortez said. In 2018, hewas the first physician in the world to implant a Micra leadlesspacemaker through the internal jugular vein in a child. A first transfemoral transseptal mitral valve replacement UC Davis Health cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons recently performed the insti - tution's first trans - femoral transseptal mitral valve replace - ment (TMVR) proce - dure, making UC Davis Medical Center the first hospital on the West Coast to perform the procedure with this new valve. Minimally invasive TMVR can be used to treat mitral valve stenosis, regurgitation, or a mix. Transfemoral transseptal access is through the femoral vein of the leg and the least invasive of implantation methods; the vein is exposed surgically, with the remainder of the procedure performed under fluoroscopy and echocardiography. No surgical access through the chest is required. Jason H. Rogers, M.D., F.A.C.C., F.S.C.A.I. , professor of cardiovascular medicine, is site principal investigator with co-investigator Gagan D. Singh, M.D., M.S. , associate professor of cardiovascular medicine.Cardiologists at UC Davis Medical Center recently completed their first transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR) procedure, becoming the first hospital in the Sacramento region to perform the mini - mally invasive treatment. The procedure was performed as part of a clinical trial, and treats tricuspid regurgita - tion with a new option versus medications alone or open-heart surgery. Gagan D. Singh, M.D., M.S. , associate professor of cardiovascular medicine, and Structural Heart Team members replaced the valve using a catheter inserted through the major leg vein; they will monitor participants for five years.Initial transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement procedure World-first Volume milestones for TCAR, robotic-assisted bronchoscopy procedure UC Davis Health has announced its 100th Transcarotid Artery Revascularization (TCAR) procedure for carotid artery disease and its 100th robotic-assisted bronchoscopy procedure for minimally invasive peripheral lung biopsy, becoming the first hospital in the Sacramento region to reach each milestone. Spring 202319 Noteworthy CLINICAL PROGRAMSStudy takes aim at low lung cancer screening The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center's Office of Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) is launching a study to investigate why it's challenging to get eligible patients to come in for lung cancer screening. An estimated 80-90% of all lung cancers are caused by tobacco use, and new lung cancer screening guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force were rolled out in 2021 to make it easier for smokers and former smokers to qualify. But screening rates remain abysmally low, with only about 1% of those eligible getting screened in California. New robot completes region's first comprehensive robotic neurosurgery program UC Davis Health's robotic neuro - surgery program has expanded to include a robot for cranial procedures such as deep brain stimulation implants, enabling the program to employ robotic surgery to treat patients with Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, tremor, and brain tumors. The acquisition makes UC Davis Health the first to offer a compre - hensive robotic neurosurgery program in the region \u2014 one that spans cranial, spine, and endovascular surgery and can be used for adult and pediatric patients. The program already routinely uses robotics for spine surgery, endovascular treatment of stroke and aneu - rysms, and delivery of laser interstitial therapy to brain tumors and brain regions causing epilepsy. Program leaders note that robotic technology can increase patient safety; shorten procedure, wait and recovery times; and lead to better outcomes in procedures such as spinal fusions. UC Davis Health also offers comprehensive education in robotic-assisted neurosurgery to residents.

Olson, Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Chemistry and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine at UC Davis. \"If we can harness those beneficial properties while engineering molecules that are safer and more scalable, we can help a lot of people.\"Drugs such as LSD, MDMA and psilocybin show great promise for treating a wide range of mental disorders that are characterized by a loss of neural connections. UC Davis has launched an Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics to advance basic knowledge about the mechanisms of psychedelics and translate it into safe and effective treatments for diseases such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, among others. Olson will be the founding director of the new institute, with John A. Gray, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Neurology, serving as associate director. In 2018, Olson and Gray published an influ - ential study in Cell Reports (DOI: https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.05.022) demonstrating that psychedelics promote neuroplasticity \u2014 the growth of new neurons and formation of neural connections. \"Neuronal atrophy is a key factor underlying many diseases,\" said Gray, \"and the ability of psychedelics to promote the growth of neurons and new connections in the brain could have broad therapeutic implications.\" A historic investment The UC Davis institute will be funded in part by a contribution of approximately $5 million from the deans of the College of Letters and Science and the School of Medicine, the Vice Chancellor for Research and the Provost's office. While other psychedelic science centers have been formed across the country with gifts from philanthropists, the UC Davis insti - tute is notable for also being supported by substantial university funds. \"We wanted to put our money where our mouth is and demonstrate our commitment to this space,\" said Estella Atekwana, Ph.D., dean of the College of UC Davis Health24Screening hundreds of compounds to find new addiction treatments related to psychedelics Evidence from human and animal testing suggests the brain-altering effects of psychedelics could be repurposed for treating addiction. Now, researchers at UC Davis and the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus plan to screen hundreds of compounds to discover new, non-hallucinogenic treatments for substance use disorders. The research is funded by a $2.7 million grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health. Previous work has shown psychedelic drugs can rewire parts of the brain involved in depression, substance abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder. David E. Olson, Ph.D., associate professor in the departments of Chemistry, and Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine at UC Davis, is searching for similar effects among compounds without the hallucinogenic effects of drugs like LSD. He calls these compounds psychoplastogens, for their ability to modify the brain. \"I'm very excited that NIDA is recognizing the potential that psychoplastogens might have for patients with substance use disorders,\" Olson said. \"This grant will help us to understand the basic mechanisms by which these compounds impact addic - tion, and hopefully develop more effective and better tolerated treatments.\" Olson's work is part of a growing focus on psychedelics research at UC Davis and UC Davis Health. His lab has synthesized hundreds of mole - cules related to psychedelics in the search for new drug thera - pies. One such molecule, taber - nanthalog, or TBG, produces both rapid and sustained anti-addictive effects in rodent models of heroin and alcohol self-administration. The research will include mech - anistic studies to understand how TBG impacts addiction and the development of new compounds with psychoplastogenic effects, he said. The team will use high-throughput screening to test for efficacy, safety and treatment potential. Promising compounds will undergo additional animal testing at CU Anschutz. Delix Therapeutics, a startup founded by investi - gating non-hallucinogenic psycho - plastogens for treating depression, anxiety and related disorders but is not involved in the project. Previous work has shown psychedelic drugs can rewire parts of the brain in - volved in depression, substance abuse and PTSD. Olson is searching for similar effects among compounds without the hallucinogenic effects of drugs like LSD. SNAPSHOTS: TWO EXAMPLES OF THE KIND OF RESEARCH AREAS BEING PURSUED BY INSTITUTE SCIENTISTS Letters and Science overseeing the new institute. Additionally, philanthropic donations as well as grants and spon - sored research agreements from the federal government, private foundations and industry partners will support the mission of the institute. \"UC Davis has been leading the development of new medicines based on psychedelic research, and together with philanthropists, granting agencies, and industrial partners, I'm confident that we can produce major benefits for society,\" Atekwana said.Leveraging strengths in chemistry, neuroscience and medicine The institute will leverage the extraordinary breadth of expertise in the neuroscience community at UC Davis, which includes nearly 300 faculty members in centers, institutes and departments across the Davis and Sacramento campuses. Re- searchers will be able to work on every aspect of psychedelic science, from molecules and cells through to human clinical trials. \"Combining the considerable expertise of UC Davis' pioneering basic research teams, world-class neuroscien - tists and our nationally recognized medical center is a formula for success that we trust will result in ground - breaking discoveries that will help patients regionally and worldwide,\" said Susan Murin, M.D., M.Sc., M.B.A., interim dean of the School of Medicine who partnered with Atekwana to support the new institute. The Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics was specifically designed to facilitate collaborations across campus, such as that between Olson and Lin Tian, Ph.D., a professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine. In 2021, their publication in Cell (DOI: https://doi. org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.043) was voted the #2 biomedical research discovery of the year by the STAT Madness virtual tournament. A unique feature of the UC Davis insti - tute will be its focus on chemistry and the development of novel neurotherapeutics. In 2018, Olson and Gray published an influential study in Cell Reports demonstrating that psychedelics promote neuroplasticity \u2014 the growth of new neurons and formation of neural connections. Cover Story Spring 202325Receptor location matters for psychedelic drug effects Location, location, location is the key for psychedelic drugs that could treat mental illness by rapidly rebuilding connections between nerve cells. In a paper published Feb. 17 in Science , UC Davis researchers show that engaging serotonin 2A receptors inside neurons promotes growth of new connec - tions, but engaging the same receptor on the surface of nerve cells does not. The findings will help guide efforts to discover new drugs for depression, PTSD and other disor - ders, said senior author David E. Olson, Ph.D., associate professor of chemistry, biochemistry and molecular medicine and director of the Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics at UC Davis.Drugs such as LSD, MDMA and psilocybin show great promise for treating a wide range of mental disorders that are characterized by a loss of neural connections. In laboratory studies, a single dose of these drugs can cause rapid growth of new dendrites \u2014 branches \u2014 from nerve cells, and formation of new spines on those dendrites. Olson calls this group of drugs \"psychoplastogens\" because of their ability to regrow and remodel connections in the brain. What allows brain connections to regrow?Earlier work from Olson's and other labs showed that psyche - delic drugs work by engaging the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR). But other drugs that engage the same receptor, including sero - tonin, do not have the same growth effects.Maxemiliano Vargas, a graduate student in Olson's lab, Olson and colleagues experimented with chemically tweaking drugs and using transporters to make it easier or harder for compounds to slip across cell membranes. Serotonin itself is polar, meaning it dissolves well in water but does not easily cross the lipid membranes that surround cells. The psychedelics, on the other hand, are much less polar and can easily enter the interior of a cell. They found that the growth- promoting ability of compounds was correlated with the ability to cross cell membranes. Drug receptors are usually thought of as being on the cell membrane, facing out. But the researchers found that in nerve cells, serotonin 2A receptors were concentrated inside cells, mostly around a structure called the Golgi body, with some receptors on the cell surface. Other types of sig-naling receptors in the same class were on the surface. The results show that there is a location bias in how these drugs work, Olson said. Engaging the serotonin 2A receptor when it is inside a cell produces a different effect from triggering it when it is on the outside. \"It gives us deeper mechanistic insight into how the receptor promotes plasticity, and allows us to design better drugs,\" Olson said. SNAPSHOTS: TWO EXAMPLES OF THE KIND OF RESEARCH AREAS BEING PURSUED BY INSTITUTE SCIENTISTS Additional authors include: from UC Davis, Lee Dunlap, Chunying Dong, Samuel Carter, Robert Tombari, Lin Tian, John Gray, Shekib Jami, Seona Patel, Lindsay Cameron and Hannah Saeger; Joseph Hennessey and John McCorvy from the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. The work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation, and by a sponsored research agreement with Delix Therapeutics. \"Psychedelics have a lot of thera - peutic potential, but we can do better,\" Olson said. In 2020, his group published a paper in Nature (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-3008-z) describing the first non-hallu - cinogenic analogue of a psychedelic compound capable of promoting neuroplasticity and producing antide - pressant and anti-addictive effects in preclinical models. Olson calls these molecules psychoplastogens because of their effect on neuron growth. Novel molecules tailored to specific disease indications could offer substantial benefits and open doors to partner - ships with industry by solving many issues currently faced by traditional psychedelics related to safety, scal - ability, and intellectual property.Bridging the gap between academia and industry Major challenges exist for translating academic discoveries and promising lead compounds into drug candidates for clin - ical use. To bridge this gap, the institute a ims to spin out companies and build strong collaborations with pharmaceu- tical partners through licensing and s ponsored research agreements. Delix Therapeutics, a company co- founded by Olson, has licensed UC Davis technology and supported several leading-edge basic research projects on campus related to psychoplastogens and neuroplasticity. Recently, Delix was n amed a top academic spinout company by Nature Biotechnology and C&E News , and in 2021, was named one of the Fierce 1 5 by Fierce Biotech. \"Our relationship with UC Davis has been very synergistic, and we are excited to continue that partnership,\" said Delix CEO Mark Rus, M.Sc. \"Getting the brightest and most creative minds from academia and industry to work together is our best chance to solve many of the grand challenges facing society today.\"In 2020, Olson's group published a paper in Nature describing the first non-hallucinogenic analogue of a psychedelic compound capable of promoting neuroplasticity and producing antidepressant and anti-addictive effects in preclinical models. \u00bb Learn more: neurotherapeutics.ucdavis.edu.

Tina Palmieri, chief of burn surgery, credits triage criteria for improving outcomes for burn survivors today. A fiery crash 50 years ago spurred today's world-class burn careSpring 202327 September 24, 2022 marked a dark day for Sacramento. It was on that day 50 years ago that 22 people died \u2014 12 of them children \u2014 when a Korean War-vintage Sabre fighter jet taking off from the Sacramento Executive Airport overran the runway and slammed into Farrell's Ice Cream Parlour. Witness accounts indicate about 100 people were inside the popular eatery when the crash involving an inexperienced pilot who had partic-ipated in the Golden West Sport Aviation Show changed their lives forever. Twenty-five people were injured, many with serious burns. Margie Smith, who lived nearby with her husband and three young children, remembers that Sunday like it was yesterday. \"Our neighbor's daughter told us about the crash. But that's all we knew,\" she recalled. \"It wasn't until the next morning that we learned how close to home it hit.\"a jet plane skidded off a runway and slammed into a Sacramento ice cream parlor full of families. The response to the tragedy led to the nationally recognized UC Davis Health burn center \u2014 and advances in burn care, survival, and support locally and beyond.IN 1972 Tina Palmieri, chief of burn surgery, credits triage criteria for improving outcomes for burn survivors today.UC Davis Health28 Smith's neighbors \u2014 Warren, Sandy, Jennifer and Brandon Krier \u2014 all died while celebrating Warren's birthday at Farrell's. Brandon was two years old, only a few weeks younger than Smith's son, Brian, at the time. \"I distinctly remember watching the news. They carried out a stretcher that was covered, but the outline of a very small child's body could be seen through that cover. I often wonder if it was Brandon,\" Smith tearfully recounted. Larry Hopkins, now 80 years old, was a Sacramento City firefighter with nine years under his belt. Though off To mark the Firefighters Burn Institute's 50th anniversary occasion, the organization unveiled a permanent memo - rial display at the Sacramento Regional Fire Museum. (Courtesy of FFBI)duty, he witnessed several emergency vehicles heading toward Freeport Boulevard. He followed, saw the flames and rushed to help. \"It was utter devastation. I wasn't a newbie. I was used to that kind of stuff. But this was pushing the envelope as far as a disaster at that time,\" he said. \"There's nothing good to be said about any of it.\" But something good ultimately resulted from that day. The crash altered the future of burn care for the Sacramento region and beyond. A fallen colleague helps spark a quest for better care Firefighter Gene Levine was off duty that day, dining inside Farrell's with his family. Levine perished along with eight relatives. Sacramento Fire Capt. Cliff Haskell was on duty downtown. It wasn't until later that he would learn his friend and colleague had died in the blaze. He was distraught by the tragedy. Once the ashes cooled, Haskell realized that specialized burn care was lacking in Sacramento.At the time, the only treatment center for burn patients was nearly 400 miles away at UCLA, with a smaller unit 90 miles away at UCSF. Fresh off a fire safety conference in Louisiana, Haskell returned to Sacramento with one goal: to establish a world-class burn unit in Sacramento. By December 1973, he helped create the Firefighters Pacific Burn Institute, now called the Firefighters Burn Institute. A month later the burn unit opened at Sacramento Medical Center, known today as UC Davis Medical Center. \"In the aftermath of the fire, people learned that survivors were backed up in the hallways of the medical center because there was no resource to handle an event like that,\" said Joe Pick, current executive director of the Firefighters Burn Institute. \"I don't think anyone realized our lack of good access to burn care until after that happened.\" \"We could do better\" A consultant hired by the Sacramento firefighters agreed. According to reports from May 1973, R.A. Kolvoord, director of the Southern Burn Institute in Louisiana, said there was \"no doubt about the need for a burn treatment center\" in the region. At the time, the only treatment center for burn patients was nearly 400 miles away at UCLA, with a smaller unit 90 miles away at UCSF. Sacramento-area media gathered to report on the opening of the new UC Davis burn center on Jan. 15, 1974. (Courtesy of the UC Davis Library Archives and Special Collections) Spring 202329\"Cliff knew we could do better. He wanted an organized structure. So, he went to the Firefighters Local 522 union to establish an organization to raise the money to create one,\" Pick said. \"Cliff had a passion that just wouldn't end,\" Hopkins added. Haskell and the team were so devoted to creating a place for specialized burn care that they set up a fund in memory of Levine. They worked with community leaders, physicians and leadership at UC Davis Health. More than $1 million was raised to open the Firefighters Burn Institute Regional Burn Center at UC Davis Medical Center. The center is located on the second floor of the hospital on the UC Davis Health campus. Specialists treat victims of highway crashes and wildland fires who sometimes arrive by helicopter. Children's specialized needs usher in pediatric burn programBut all burn patients are not alike. For children, multiple complica - tions can arise from the immune and metabolic changes that result from a severe burn. Young burn patients face more serious risks than adults, in part because toddlers explore with their hands and mouths and get burned. And small children with big burns can be very uncomfortable. For many of the 25 survivors of the Farrell's crash, especially the burn victims, the specialized care they so greatly needed did not exist. Back then, adults who suffered severe burns would rehabilitate in two to three years. But for children, it could take up to 20 years. Fortunately, specialized pediatric burn care became a reality in Sacra-mento, right across the street from UC Davis Medical Center.\"The collaborative commitment to a comprehensive burn program provided an ideal framework for leaders of Shriners Children's to estab - lish a multidisciplinary specialty pedi - atric health care facility that focused on burns as one of the main service lines,\" said Alan Anderson, director of development for Shriners Children's Northern California. \"When we opened our doors in 1997, we featured a first-of-its-kind pediatric burn program led by David Greenhalgh.\" Greenhalgh (M.D., F.A.C.S.), a renowned burn surgeon was recruited to lead the burn programs at both \"It was a lot more work than I thought it would be. We had to earn the respect of the community and the doctors and the families... Some people were concerned we'd take away from UC Davis by having Shriners Children's locally, but the opposite happened. We focused on providing the best care, and by doing so were able to grow both.\" -DAVID GREENHALGH Shriners Children's and UC Davis Health. \"It was a lot more work than I thought it would be. We had to earn the respect of the community and the doctors and the families,\" recalled Greenhalgh, who retired from UC Davis Health last year but con-tinues to oversee the program and his patients at Shriners Children's. \"Some people were concerned we'd take away from UC Davis by having Shriners Children's locally, but the opposite happened. We focused on providing the best care, and by doing so were able to grow both.\" David Greenhalgh, Shriners Children's and UC Davis Health (retired) burn surgeon. UC Davis Health30 From the ashes UC Davis Health Burn Center Manager Len Sterling, right, leads a team that is ready at a moment's notice for whatever natural or manmade disaster leads to burn patients.Since its launch in 1974, the UC Davis Burn Center has been one the nation's top programs for burn care, research and training. Its mission and reputation have greatly expanded over the past four decades. Advances lead to better survival rates, improved quality of life The institute was a silver lining that resulted from the crash and transformed the regional response to burn care. For more than 48 years, it has offered the highest-quality treatment and recovery for severely burned patients from throughout Northern California, and greater hope for their families. \"Those injured in 1972 were taken to local hospitals, where surgeons did their best to treat them, but unfortunately they had very limited knowledge of burn care,\" said Tina Palmieri, M.D., a surgeon and chief of the Firefighters Burn Insti - tute Regional Burn Center at UC Davis Medical Center. \"Their initial treatment would have been to assess them for trau - matic injuries and burns.\" Since its launch in 1974, the UC Davis Burn Center has been one of the nation's top programs for burn care, research and training. Its mission and reputation have greatly expanded over the past four decades. Burn treatment involves many components, from initial first aid and assessment of the degree of the burn to wound excision, grafting and infection control. According to a national study, \"the last 50 years has seen a tremendous improvement in the advancement of burn treatment with a significant reduc - tion in mortality which can be attributed to the developments in early burn exci - sion, early fluid resuscitation, infection control and nutrition.\" Palmieri credits mortality reduction to the advent of burn center triage criteria, including burn degree, percentage of body surface area, and patients who require special social, emotional or long-term rehabilitation intervention. \"We also use new methods for mech- anical ventilation and resuscitation for those critically injured,\" she explained. \"The burn field continues to expand its knowledge about burn injury, particularly with respect to artificial skin, stem cells and cultured skin.\" What has also helped is advances in physical facilities. In 2010, the UC Davis unit moved into its larger current loca -tion \u2014 triple the size of its former space \u2014 consolidating into a single location and accommodating more patients. The move created individual rooms for patients, which has improved the survival rate, since the leading cause of death among burn victims is infection. Since many survivors require months of care, the new rooms also included windows, which helps with emotional health. And because the improved capabilities were the direct result of an additional $1 million raised by area firefighters, the move ushered in a new name \u2014 the Firefighters Burn Institute Regional Burn Center. \"Merely surviving a burn is not good enough,\" Palmieri said. \"Our goal is to return our patients to a meaningful life.\" In 2021, the team received re-verifi - cation as an Adult Burn Center from the American Burn Association (ABA) for meeting the highest standards of care for burn-injured patients. And for children, whose burns present a unique challenge, the expert care at Shriners Children's is across the street.Spring 202331 Bracing for the next emergency The UC Davis Burn Center team can quickly leverage resources in burn management, surgery, trauma and intensive care to treat a range of burn-related injuries. And with increased expertise and need, patient volume has increased as well. In 1997 before Shriners Children's opened, the UC Davis Burn Center admitted 180 patients. In 2021, the number of patients admitted for treatment between the two centers quadrupled to approximately 750. Part of that growth is due to the increasing numbers and size of major wildfires in Northern California. As the only burn center in a vast region, UC Davis Health takes on a mission and responsibility to being prepared for and focused on the needs of burn patients. The next nearest centers are in the Bay Area, Fresno, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and Portland. Over the years, the center's surgeons, nurses and rehabilitation specialists have been on the front lines of treating patients injured by wildfires. They regu - larly practice their response plan for large-scale fires with multiple victims, and collaborate with other burn centers throughout the western U.S. UC Davis developed the burn disaster triage diagram that is now used in burn disasters across the nation. It has served as the primary center for triage and treatment of Northern California wild - fire patients. \"We've been affected by so many big fire events in recent years that we have to assume another one is coming,\" said Len Sterling, R.N., M.B.A., N.E.A.-B.C., the burn center's nurse manager. \"We want to be nimble, flexible and treat all patients who need us.\" Austin Palmiere knows the risks of the job. A fire captain with CAL FIRE, he's served on the front line for 14 years. But on Oct. 9, 2022, while at the Placerville Fire Center between calls, his shift was anything but routine. The company vehicle he was working on caught fire. He and a fellow firefighter rushed to put out the blaze, when an explosion knocked them to the ground. They were rushed to the Firefighters Burn Institute Regional Burn Center at UC Davis. UC Davis developed the burn disaster triage diagram that is now used in burn disasters across the nation. It has served as the primary center for triage and treatment of Northern California wildfire patients. Firefighter Austin Palmiere and his wife Lainey chose \"Davis\" for their baby Colt's middle name because of Palmiere's life-saving care from the UC Davis Health burn team.UC Davis Health32 \"Merely surviving a burn is not good enough. Our goal is to return our patients to a meaningful life.\" - TINA PALMIERI \"At the time I didn't feel a ton of pain because of the shock and adrenaline. I didn't think I was even burned that bad,\" Palmiere said. \"It was surreal arriving at the UC Davis ER, because I've dropped off patients in that room.\" Palmiere, 32, had second- and third- degree burns on 26% of his face, hands and upper body. He faced weeks of recovery. He says three things moti - vated him: support from his family, friends and firefighters; the expertise of the burn center team at UC Davis Health; and the expected arrival of his first son with his wife Lainey, roughly one month away. Palmiere had two surgeries. He began walking independently three weeks after his injury. Finally, he left the burn intensive care unit 35 days after his arrival \u2014 one week before baby Colt's arrival. \"Now, he's holding him, rocking him and doing a bunch of things that weren't imaginable the day Austin came home. I'm so grateful,\" Lainey Palmiere said. \"I took my time getting here, but I'm changing diapers now,\" Austin Palmiere added. Diapers that belong to Colt Davis Palmiere, whose middle name is a tribute to the team that brought his father through the worst trauma of his life. Remaining challenges, awaiting supportDespite the success of treating burn survivors, many challenges remain, especially as people live longer. The focus of burn care in the future includes treating the elderly, caring for those with extensive burns, increasing the quality of the lives saved by shortening healing times and hospital stays, and finding more ways to reduce scarring. \"It's hard to push the survival of the youngest burn victims any higher. But we've made great strides in the elderly,\" Greenhalgh said. \"When I first started in burns, we wouldn't bother to resuscitate 60-year-olds with 60% burns. But we've made the greatest improvements in this population because of better wound coverage and critical care.\" Palmieri added, \"Quality of life has become the priority for most people who are burned, as we can save most people. For the very young and the very old, however, improving survival is still a major priority.\" Beyond the expertise of the surgery team and UC Davis Health are experts who provide resources and peer support that bring hope and inspiration to burn patients and their families. The institute and its support resources have earned a national reputation for providing critical services to survivors and families, and is a Phoenix Society SOAR-designated facility, recognized for providing peer support and mentoring for burn survivors. Gabriel Gonzalez stayed positive after suffering third-degree burns over 46% of his body from a firepit accident.Spring 202333 Resources include weekly meetings ranging from half-hour lunch bunch gatherings to hour-long discussions with health professionals. There's even a session devoted to yoga and mindfulness. The institute also offers the weeklong Firefighters Kids Camp for young burn survivors; the Youth Firesetter Program for parents and troubled adolescents; the Liaison Response Team for injured fire - fighters; and scholarships that support survivors and the health professionals who care for them. \"From the ashes, we realized that, as firefighters, we do what we can while we're there and then figure out how can we do something better,\" Pick explained. \"That opened up all the doors for our programs for kids and other support groups so we could connect with this community.\" Coleen Gonzalez says when she learned that her 18-year-old son Gabriel was severely burned in a firepit accident last year, \"it's the worst call you get.\" While the care team at the Firefighters Burn Institute Regional Burn Center mapped out his six weeks of physical recovery, she turned to support groups that help survivors and their caregivers deal with emotional healing. \"This is like a marathon you're running. Even when he got home, we were still running that marathon,\" Gonzalez said. \"The group has taught me I'm not the only one. And that, yes, it's going to be different, but we don't have to stop living.\" Institute leaders hope to establish additional mental health resources in the future. Pick and his team have begun work with clinical psychologists and the social work department at Sacramento State University. They hope that their expertise, coupled with funds raised through donors and the popular Fill the Boot for Burns campaign, can create a mental health program with lasting benefits.Service and outreachNearly five decades after that tragic day at Farrell's, the UC Davis Burn Center and Firefighters Burn Institute have expanded their programs in burn research, public education, fire and burn prevention, and burn recovery for survivors and their families. Had a burn center like today's existed 50 years ago, the UC Davis BURN AWARENESSEvery year, Sacramento-area firefighters raise money through \"Fill the Boot for Burn Survivors.\" (Courtesy of Hansen Kwok, M.D.) The first full week of February is National Burn Awareness Week, a time for educators to share burn and prevention messages in their communities and highlight the most common injuries. This year's theme is \"Hot Liquids Burn Like Fire\" and the data of inju - ries each year in the U.S. backs that up: \u008241% are flame burns \u008231% are scalds and most burns in children less than 5 \u00826% are electrical burns \u00825% are chemical burns Resources: ameriburn.org, nfpa.org, phoenix-society.org. team agrees, the Farrell's victims would have had a greater chance of not only surviving, but living more functional lives. \"I'm grateful that the firefighters long ago had the foresight to support a burn program,\" Greenhalgh said. \"I'm proud to say we were able to work with them \u2014 and we have one of the best programs in the country.\"UC Davis study identifies evidence-backed strategies for graduate medical education How can medical residency training programs improve diversity and, consequently, the quality of health care? UC Davis Health researchers have some suggestions, backed by evidence. In a study published in January in JAMA Network Open (DOI: doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.55110), a team of researchers analyzed more than two \"This is intended for programs that are very early in their journey toward diversifying, to be able to apply founda - tional strategies we highlighted,\" Sanchez said. \"And it's also intended for programs that are much farther along in their path, so they can have a more aspirational list of strategies to consider.\" More diversity means better health outcomes for patientsUC Davis has long been a model for its commitment to diversity and inclusion. The School of Medicine ranked No. 3 in diversity for medical schools across the nation, according to the 2023 U.S. News & World Report list of \"Best Graduate Schools.\" dozen residency programs across the country. All employ strategies to boost diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). The team then compiled their findings to share widely with Graduate Medical Education (GME) programs seeking to diversify the physician workforce. The study is believed to be the first-of-its-kind to compile a compre - hensive list of data-driven approaches to increasing diversity, equity and inclusion in GME programs. \"We have created a guide to help GME programs move forward in improving their DEI efforts,\" said Stephany Sanchez, M.D., a co-author and an associate clinical professor of internal medicine at UC Davis Health. UC Davis Health 34 Alumni, students and friends How to increase diversity in medical residency programsGME, commonly referred to as resi - dency, is the training required for medical school graduates before they become eligible to take board exams for certifica - tion in their chosen specialty field. GME can last anywhere from three to seven years, most often at an academic medical center like UC Davis. Nationally, GME programs are striving to increase the number of physi - cians from backgrounds underrepre - sented in medicine. However, challenges exist. These trainees, from Latino, Black, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander popula - tions, are less likely to be offered place - ment in GME. \"Closing the diversity gap is critical to ensure equity in medical education and health care quality,\" the authors stated. \"Nevertheless, evidence-based strategies and best practices to improve DEI in the biomedical workforce remain poorly understood and underused.\" Studies show that patients have better health outcomes when they are cared for by doctors who understand their culture, who look like them, or speak their language. Authors of the study say that diversifying GME programs is critical to diversifying the physician workforce. Although some GME programs seek to diversify, their leaders aren't sure howImplementing DEI strategies is fairly new to GME, and a common challenge among program leaders is not knowing the steps to take at becoming more diverse. \"GME programs really want to be more inclusive,\" said co-author Tonya Fancher, M.D., M.P.H., the UC Davis asso - ciate dean for workforce innovation and education quality improvement. \"But I think programs don't always know how to do it, so this work offers a menu of successful strategies to choose from.\"There is a dearth of information about what most GME programs are doing to increase diversity and inclu - sion, but the authors found a creative way to tap into the information: They received permission to access the submission forms of GME programs that have vied for the annual Barbara Ross Lee, D.O. Award for Excellence in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, given out by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). The study was based on 29 award applications submitted between Aug. 2020 and Jan. 2022. Applicants described in detail what programs were doing to boost diversity, including efforts among trainees and faculty and staff as well as overall institutional culture. The institutions were not iden - tified in the paper, but a wide range of GME specialties were represented. Here is a sample of the themes, strategies and practices detailed in the study that some GME programs rely on to increase diversity and be more inclu - sive to current residents: \u0082Develop relationships with K-12 schools, community colleges, 4-year universities and medical schools to participate in outreach activities. \u0082Use holistic review for admissions, which emphasizes life experience over test scores and grade-point averages. \u0082Require an implicit bias mitigation course for those who interview prospective GME trainees. \u0082Include historically excluded and under - represented faculty, residents and other stakeholders on selection committees. \u0082Financially and logistically support DEI committees of residents, faculty and staff. \u0082Offer clinical experiences for residents in medically underserved communities. \u0082Support trainees through mentorship and research opportunities as a reten - tion tool for residents to stay on as faculty at the end of their training. \"We found there's a very large range of strategies \u2014 some are foundational, some are aspirational,\" said co-author Dowin Boatright, M.D., an assistant professor of emergency medicine at New York University Grossman School of Medicine (who was at Yale during the study). \"We really want to emphasize the impor - tance of foundational strategies \u2014 those that in many cases are considered high impact and can be achieved at probably low cost,\" Boatright said. \"I think we can make a lot of progress if all programs adopted even just the foundational strategies.\" The ACGME also plans to release the Equity Matters Resource Collection, which will provide even more detailed strategies for GME programs from a resource of 100 approaches identified from the Lee award. \"This is intended for programs that are very early in their journey toward diversifying, to be able to apply foundational strategies we highlighted. And it's also intended for programs that are much farther along in their path, so they can have a more aspirational list of strategies to consider.\" \u2014 STEPHANY SANCHEZ Additional co-authors from the UC Davis School of Medicine are: Arra Jane Soriano, workforce programs manager; Marjorie Westervelt, former director of assessment, evaluation, and scholarship; and Maya London, medical student.

Spring 2023 35UC Davis Health36 Alumni, students & friends Fresno native returns to Central Valley roots to conduct research, thanks to scholarship A fourth-year UC Davis medical student has been awarded a scholarship from National Medical Fellowships to conduct research on community mental health in the Central Valley. Jacqueline Le\u00f3n, who dreams of becoming a psychiatrist, will use the grant on a research project studying the mental health needs of Mexican-American fami - lies, especially immigrant parents whose children are raised in the U.S.\"This project will look at how this culture mitigates adverse mental health outcomes, or positive mental health outcomes, in Latinx, rural communities,\" she said. National Medical Fellowships is a nonprofit committed to \"disrupting racisms in medicine,\" in part by offering millions in scholarships to students underrepresented in medicine and boosting diversity in clinical research. Le\u00f3n is part of the inaugural group of scholars from across the U.S. to receive funding from the organization's Health Equity Leaders Program for exploring health equity service, scholarship, lead - ership and advocacy. Relating to immigrant families like her ownThe project is a perfect match for Le\u00f3n. The Fresno native wants to establish her career in the Central Valley and is part of the school's SJV-PRIME pathway (which has transitioned into a similar program called REACH), which provides students with extensive clinical experience in the San Joaquin Valley. She will conduct research to tackle health disparities in the Central Valley under principal investigator Rosa Manzo of UC Merced, a scientist with expertise in community engagement. \"I can relate to the experience of so many immigrant families, like mine, who are unable to access preventive medical care,\" Le\u00f3n said, \"either because they can't afford it, or due to their immigration status, or because they're working so hard that it doesn't cross their mind.\"Much of the research will be done through a federally qualified health center in Madera County, Camarena Health. Le\u00f3n will help organize focus groups to interview community health workers known as promotoras, who will tell her about specific community mental health needs. Le\u00f3n said the project speaks to the \"why\" she wants to be a physician. And it has a lot to do with her upbringing: She can relate to the experience of so many agricultural worker families, like hers, who face barriers to care. \"We didn't go to pediatric well-child visits,\" Le\u00f3n said. \"We came from a family that only went to the doctor when you're losing a limb, or you can't breathe \u2014 high acuity emergency situations.\" Successful journey to medical school Le\u00f3n studied public health at UC Berkeley and enrolled in the UC Davis School of Medicine Postbaccalaureate Program, which prepares recent grads to apply for medical school. But instead of setting her immediate sights on medical school, Le\u00f3n chose to attend UCLA for a master's degree in public health, which bolstered a health education career she started years earlier. \"This award is an accumulation of everything I've done, which has been centered around community and social justice,\" Le\u00f3n said. \"This is pretty much the start of becoming a community psychiatrist.\" Medical student to study mental health needs of Mexican-American parents Jacqueline Le\u00f3n, shown with her mother, at her UCLA master's degree in public health graduation in 2016.\"We didn't go to pediatric well-child visits.

School of Medicine contributions also helped raise $33,297 for the program.All 106 UC Davis students who entered the match got placed into programs during Match Day 2023 at the UC Davis School of Medicine. The vast majority \u2014 82% \u2014 will stay in California after graduating in May, and 23% of them will remain at UC Davis Health. Most students, 58%, will go into primary care programs; the large share is encouraging, as UC Davis and other UC medical schools fervently try to produce more internal and family medicine doctors, who are in especially short supply in underserved rural locations. Emergency medicine programs will receive 15 of the graduates, pediatrics 13, and anesthesia programs nine. Students who aren't staying in California matched into programs in 13 states. Innovative research on display at Poster Day A total of 114 posters \u2014 such as student Samantha Wong's study \"Views of Non-Physician Stakeholders on Barriers & Facilitators of AYA Cancer Care in Latin America\" \u2014 were on display in the Education Building at this year's Poster Day, as UC Davis School of Medicine continues its mission of improving health through innovative research. The school's research opportunities are particularly robust and include: \u0082M.D./Ph.D. Program: An integrated program that combines medical and graduate education, leading to both the M.D. and Ph.D. degrees. \u0082Academic Research Careers for Medical Doctors (ARC-MD)Program: A five-year program that provides medical students with skills that promote a successful physician-scientist career. Med students spend the fourth year conducting research. \u0082Medical Student Research Fellowship: Students spend four or eight weeks enhancing their medical training through basic science, clinical investigation, or health care delivery research. 106 students match, mostly in California1976 Rahnea Lee Sunseri Vaiarello After leaving the front lines practicing internal medicine, I spent the last 6 years as part of the team founding the University of the Pacific's Master of Physician Assistant Studies. I served as medical director and faculty, teach-ing pharmacology, medicine, and some behavioral medi - cine. In addition, I was the advisor for Capstone projects of 22 students each year. Being involved in every aspect of the program has been fun. I loved teaching eager students. The university has since created the School of Health Sciences, which incorporated the PA program as well as other established programs, and has added new graduate degrees in the health sciences. Because I wanted to spend more time with family and friends, I decided to retire, which I did this last April. Now I can get outdoors more. Teaching is an almost 24/7 job. We Zoomed thru COVID-19.

Malcolm MacKenzie, M.D., a former professor in the Division of Hematology/Oncology at the UC Davis School of Medicine, died at home in October 2022 at age 87. Malcolm studied medicine at UCSF and later completed post-doctoral fellowships in physiological chemistry and hematology. His goal of combining research and clinical work, seeking treatments for his patients, led to his career in academia. He served as an assistant professor at UCSF and an attending physician at San Francisco General Hospital, and similar roles at the University of Cincinnati and Cincinnati General. Returning to California, he joined the faculty at the nascent School of Medicine at UC Davis as a professor of medicine in the Division of Hematology/Oncology, where he spent the rest of his academic career, teaching, seeing patients and doing research. Malcolm retired from UC Davis at age 60. He then became director of the Center for Blood Research of the Sacramento Medical Foundation Blood Center for 10 years before he (once again) retired. Although most of his research involved cancer studies, Malcolm also published papers to help further understanding of AIDS treatment. As a pioneer in the study of multiple myeloma, he published many papers identifying markers on specific types of blood cells. Malcolm is survived by his wife, Natalie; daughter Leslie and son-in-law Jonathan Blackie; daughter Tracie and son-in-law Augusto Sarti; daughter-in-law Heather K. MacKenzie; grandchildren Lindsay and Stuart Blackie, and Alexander, Sean and Kevin Sarti; and brother Sherwin MacKenzie. He was preceded in death by his son, Kenneth MacKenzie. Excerpted from The Davis Enterprise Anne Kent, M.D. '84, passed away at her Newport Beach home in November 2022 surrounded by her beloved family. She was 64. During Anne's final years, she lived with ALS. Anne is survived by her husband of 38 years, Robert; children Tyler (Andrea), Ryan (Kristin), and Victoria (Joshua) Samuels; grand - children Hudson, Calvin, Lucas, and Iris Anne; and her seven siblings, numerous nieces and nephews and countless friends, dear colleagues, and patients. Her parents, James and Patricia Murphy, preceded her in death. Born in San Jose, Anne was the oldest daughter of eight siblings. She attended Presentation High School, but determined to be a doctor like her dad, took specialized science classes at the all-boys' high school across town. At UCLA, Anne met her love, and life partner, Rob. In 1980, she graduated magna cum laude and went on to medical school at UC Davis, where she was a member of Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society. Anne completed her ob/gyn residency at UC Irvine, and in her final year served as chief resident. Anne moved into private practice at Doctor's Office for Women, which grew into a prominent women's health practice in Orange County. She delivered over 10,000 babies at Hoag hospital and ended her career as president of Pacific Women's Healthcare Associates. Her passion lives on at Hoag with the \"Jeffrey M. Carlton Endowed Chair in Women's Health, in honor of Dr. Anne Kent.\" She received a Courage Award from Augie's Quest, a foundation seeking a cure for ALS. Excerpted from the Orange County Register In memoriam In memoriam UC Davis Health 40Partner Update SCHOOL OF NURSING Health care is a team sport that requires different perspectives Registered nurses (RNs) are the frontline of patient care and the backbone of our health care system. They deliver person- centered care and assist family caregivers in the transition from clinical settings to home. They offer the best hope for more equi - table health care by bringing more diversity to the workforce. I was reminded of these qualities and why nursing is the most trusted profession \u2014 for the 20 th straight year \u2014 at the Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing at UC Davis' December pinning ceremony for our Master's Entry Program in Nursing Class of 2022. While RNs are the largest segment of the health care workforce, they by no means can care for patients and families alone. Health care is a team sport that requires different perspec - tives from clinicians trained in different disciplines to collabo - rate on a common goal. In fact, several studies suggest that a team-based approach both improves patient outcomes and improves clinician well-being. For us at the School of Nursing, optimal health and health equity for all is the goal woven into each education and clinical experience for our students \u2014 future RNs, physician assistants (PAs), family nurse practitioners and nurse scientists. We are, by design, a team-based school that brings interprofessional education and exposure to every facet of our curriculum. Upon completion, our alumni bring with them the values, beliefs and skills of the Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing. The school was founded to create agents of change in an ever-evolving health care system. The past three-plus years illustrate that constant change and paint a challenging future: \u0082A predicted increase of up to 12% in inpatient hospitalizations in 2025 \u2014 due to those with long-COVID and those who delayed treatment during COVID. \u0082An aging population with more chronic conditions that will greatly expand visits to ambulatory and outpatient settings. \u0082Inequitable care for underserved populations and commu-nities of color due to systemic racism and years of biased research and practice.The demand for critical-thinking, problem-solving providers is evident now more than ever. To prepare them to be the change agents and leaders we know they can be, we expose them to those realities while still in school. Recently, future nurses in the School of Nursing partnered with future physicians in the UC Davis School of Medicine in an interprofessional poverty simulation. Students role-play the lives of families who are low-income to understand the realities of poverty. The simulation is designed to sensitize those who frequently deal with families that are disadvantaged. Later this year, future nurses and PAs will have the opportunity to work on a School of Nursing led mobile health clinic that serves people experiencing homelessness, refugees and unaccompanied minors. These experiences expose students to underrepresented populations \u2014 the very ones they will care for in the future \u2014 with the goal of seeing beyond the patient to understand the person and all the challenges they face in accessing and main - taining their health. We believe going beyond traditional education is how we achieve health and health care equity. The RN workforce is expected to grow by 6% over the next decade. More than 40,000 new PAs will join the health care ranks in the next 10 years. The Advanced Practice Registered Nurse workforce \u2014 including nurse practitioners, nurse anes - thetists and nurse midwives \u2014 is expected to grow much faster by 40%. Their contribution and leadership in health care have never been more needed. Today, more than 70 of our master's-prepared nurses now work in our health system. In addition, more than a dozen of our PAs and advanced practice nurse practitioners work throughout the UC Davis Health network to expand patient access and equip future students with the skills they need to go beyond traditional practice. At the School of Nursing, we're proud to contribute to the future of health care and to serve as an indispensable partner at UC Davis Health. I know our graduates will make a difference fo r years to come.Stephen Cavanagh, Ph.D., M.P.A., R.N., F.A.C.H.E., F.A.A.N.An update from Stephen Cavanagh, dean of the Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing at UC Davis Spring 2023 41At 29 years old and with six years as a nurse under her belt, Pat Foster wanted something more. Working on the border, south of San Diego with Chicana girls, she felt inadequately prepared to handle all the issues they were dealing with. So, she joined 16 other nurses in a pilot program at UC Davis to prepare family nurse practitioners. In September 1971, both the program and the profes - sion were unknowns. \"When we came into the program, we all may have had a different idea of what this was because it was so new,\" recalled Foster, a graduate from the first class. \"They recruited public health nurses and it sparked my interest,\" added her Class of 1973 classmate Vicki Houle, 24 at the time. \"We were the Wild West.\" Fighting against pushback After one year at UC Berkeley, the Family Nurse Practitioner Program (FNP) transitioned to the UC Davis School of Medicine, where the goals aligned. Both were focused on solving California's From 'experimental health manpower' to increased medical independence, much has changed since UC Davis' first class of Family Nurse Practitioners graduated in 1973. UC Davis Health 42 Betty Labastida at the Warm Spring Indian Reservation preceptorship in 1973. UC Davis Health nurse practitioner residents prac - tice GI tube management in a Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing simulation suite. UC Davis' first class of FNPs graduated five decades ago. Partner Update SCHOOL OF NURSING Pioneering a profession lack of primary care, especially in rural and underserved areas. Graduates earned a Master of Health Services Degree in Family Nurse Practice. Upon completion 50 years ago this year, they faced a harsh reality. \"There was pushback. We weren't taken very seriously,\" said classmate Betty Labastida. \"It was needing to wear a flak vest every day. We had pushback from the physicians and the nurses. We were fighting on a survival level,\" Houle said. \"It amazes me how the current NPs take for granted all the things we fought for.\" While everyone agreed on the need for more primary care providers in California, the nurse practitioner profession was both innovative and unorthodox, which led to many ques - tioning its legality. The leaders of the UC Davis program gained support from Sen. Alfred Song who ultimately passed the Experimental Health Manpower Act in 1972, allowing NPs and physician assistants to practice under medical supervision. \"No one had any idea what I was and what I could do,\" said Mary Garofalo, another member of the Class of 1973. \"I had a lot of testing from physicians who enjoyed seeing me squirm.\" Serving the underserved In addition to the hurdles of being accepted in practice, program leaders also faced a test in getting the students exposed to rural areas and the popula - tions of greatest need. After one year of didactic instruction and some clinical exposure, the students embarked on a 6-month-long preceptorship, or training, in rural locations. Those early experiences planted a seed in many in that very first class. Foster would go on to work several years in Colombia, to teach FNP skills to master's-level nursing students from four Latin American countries. Houle co-owned a practice in Tahoe City and helped launch a nursing program in Swaziland (now Eswatini) with the Peace Corps. And Labastida would spend the half of her 40-plus-year career in eight countries with the U.S. Department of State Foreign Service, and the other working in county medical services along the West Coast. \"It was my dream job,\" she said. \"I feel fortunate that the program prepared me to be part of the change.\" A profession and legislation evolve The Manpower Development and Train- ing Act was the first of several legislative acts that were completed to provide permanent support. In fact, not until 2020 did NPs gain the power to practice independently via Assembly Bill 890. The bill requires a phased-in approach making eligible nurse practitioners fully independent around 2026.\"We fought to change prescription privileges. It took us five times working with the legislature to get that passed,\" Houle recalled. \"When we went down in flames for independent practice, I realized what tough skin we had to have.\" As those early NPs pioneered their new roles and the profession itself, the UC Davis program, which also included a physician assistant program, evolved. In 1974, it earned accreditation by the American Medical Association and opened up to all nurses as a certificate program. After 40 years of successful contribution to the primary care workforce, both programs transitioned to the new Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing at UC Davis in 2013 and, just as that first class, at the master's-degree level. Now the 111 graduates from the School of Nursing's program join the 1,800 who graduated from the medical school. Celebrating a half century In May, those trailblazing alumni from the Class of 1973 reunite at Betty Irene Moore Hall to mark their 50 th year since graduation. \"What an incredible impact these providers have had on the foundation of the NP profession and the health and well-being in communities here and beyond,\" said Cat Adams, senior develop - ment director at the School of Nursing. \"We want to celebrate all they've accom - plished and let them know that even though they graduated from the School of Medicine, we consider them part of our School of Nursing family too.\" For some, it will be the first time in 50 years to see each other. \"I'm looking forward to reconnecting with old friends and hearing what everyone's done with this pilot project. We've all spread our wings and done a lot of interesting things,\" Foster said. \"I think we proved ourselves, therefore we proved it for UC Davis,\" Houle added. \"I think it was a win-win for both of us.\"The Family Nurse Practitioner program and the UC Davis School of Medicine both focused on solving California's lack of primary care, especially in rural and underserved areas. Spring 2023 43 Partner Update: School of Nursing Students learn about pathways to a future health care career What do you want to be when you grow up? For many students of color, the answer may not be a future in health care. They may not realize how the profession could be for them or understand the path to achieving that goal. But a two-week summer experience at the Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing at UC Davis seeks to change that. \"I have worked with enough pre-nursing students who didn't really know some of the important things that they needed to know about their freshman and sophomore years in college, to the extent that they were no longer able to get into a nursing school,\" said Piri Ackerman-Barger, Ph.D., R.N., C.N.E., F.A.A.N., the School of Nursing's associate dean for Health Equity, Diversity and Inclusion. \"We thought that by starting high school students off with some of the core pieces of information they needed to know, so that they were successful as soon as they walked in the door to community college or to a university, that would be really helpful.\" Levert Bryant, left, and a fellow SHINES participant get hands-on experience in a hospital manikin simu - lation.Driven by the desire to show students a possible future and the need to diversify the future health care workforce, Ackerman-Barger launched the Summer Health Institute for Nursing Exploration and Success (SHINES) program. Last summer, 38 students from eight high schools serving underrep - resented students in Sacramento began the inaugural program. Simulations for health care, workshops for life Coursework includes hands-on simulations, developing a deeper understanding of the nursing practice and the social determinants of health, plus resume writing and personal branding workshops. Current nursing students also share experiences. \"I believe deeply that education is a key piece in diversifying our nursing staff and the way to achieve that is through inspiring high school students,\" explained Patricia Fernandez, SHINES co-director and incoming Doctor of Philosophy student at the school. \"They are our future. This is just the perfect opportunity to bring students together and get them excited about becoming a nurse.\" The 16- and 17-year-olds learn whether nursing is the right fit for them. SHINES both paints a nursing pathway and fosters identity formation. It gives students confidence, self-efficacy and a sense of the value they bring. \"That just really inspired me and made me like feel more comfortable and confident in like my journey to becoming a nurse,\" said Anointed Amasowomwan, a student at Consumnes River College. \"We need more diversity in the medical field that I feel like I could bring in.\" Participant Levert Bryant also wants to go into health care. \"I thought this was a chance to get me introduced to it, to go through the different aspects of it,\" the Sacramento Charter High School student said. \"And it doesn't hurt to always try something new.\" Ackerman-Barger credits overwhelming volunteer support and donor investment for the inaugural launch. The year's partners included several School of Nursing alumni, Cristo Rey High School, Arthur A. Benjamin Health Professions High School, St. HOPE Academy and Improve your Tomorrow. Thanks to involvement and investments from UC Davis Medical Center nursing leadership and School of Nursing donors, students receive a $500 completion stipend and $200 wardrobe allowance.Levert Bryant, left, and a fellow SHINES participant get hands-on experience in a hospital manikin simulation. \"If we're going to change health outcomes we must invest in our future generation.\" -PIRI ACKERMAN-BARGER, ASSOCIATE DEAN FOR HEALTH EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION UC Davis Health 44High schoolers get hands-on lessons in nursingFPO printer, please replace this Lo-res with Hi-res UC Davis Health David Lubarsky, M.D., M.B.A., F.A.S.A.

After his success at Intel made him a billionaire, Moore and his wife of 72 years, Betty, focused on philanthropy, creating the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation which invests in environ - mental conservation, science and patient care. UC Davis received a $100 million commitment in 2007 to launch an innovative nursing school. Bearing Mrs. Moore's name and dedicated to transforming health systems and education, the Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing opened its doors to the first students in 2010. After the initial commitment, the foundation continued investing in the School of Nursing; in 2017, a $5 million grant founded the Family Caregiving Institute, dedicated to supporting the more than 40 million caregivers in the U.S. In 2019, a $37.5 million investment (and recently $7.4 million more) launched the Betty Irene Moore Fellowship for Nurse Leaders and Innovators. In the past 13 years, the school has launched six graduate-degree programs, graduated more than 1,000 alumni, and is ranked among the top 25 U.S. nursing schools by U.S. News & World Report . In 2017, Gordon and Betty Moore were recognized as California's most generous philanthropists. To date, their foundation has donated more than $5.1 billion to charitable causes since its founding in 2000. FELLOWSHIP FOR NURSE LEADERS EXPANDS A $7.4 million grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation announced in March will expand the Betty Irene Moore Fellowship for Nurse Leaders and Innovators at the School of Nursing. The new grant increases the number of future fellows and builds upon the momentum of the first three cohorts, who have had significant national impact. The fellowship itself is innovative in that it supports early-to-mid-career nurse scientists who bring diversity of perspectives and thought; the fellowship funds their prototype development and exploratory work not typically funded by the NIH, such as mobile applications for health intervention, artificial intelligence to iden - tify patients at risk of certain conditions, and new tools to help prevent readmissions. In the past three years of the program, 32 early-career nursing scholars have developed their potential to accelerate leadership in nursing-science research, practice, education, policy and entrepreneurship. NATIONAL BLACK NURSES ASSOCIATION AWARDEE The National Black Nurses Association (NBNA) has named Aron King, M.S., R.N., a 2022 Under 40 Awardee. King, an assis - tant nurse manager at UC Davis Medical Center and 2021 graduate from the School of Nursing, is one of only 16 nurses in the nation to receive the honor. After caring for patients as a bedside nurse for 8 years, King entered the master's-degree leader - ship program at the School of Nursing in 2019. He is currently a student of the school's Ph.D. program. Need a quick and easy way to feel great about yourself and know you're making a difference in the lives of UC Davis students?
