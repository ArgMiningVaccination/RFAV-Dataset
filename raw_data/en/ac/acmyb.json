Over 100 years later, Alberta is an established four-season destination with much to offer: the iconic Canadian Rocky Mountains, the alluring Canadian Badlands, peaceful prairies, placid lakes, a diverse cultural history and vibrant urban and rural centres. Alberta's tourism industry delivers the \"goosebump\" moments that bring visitors back again and again. Alberta is also part of an international tourism industry that is growing at rate of 4% annually, making it one of the fastest growing industries in the world. Tourism is an \"industry of industries,\" meaning tourism is a collection of activities, services and industries that deliver a travel experience, including transportation, accommodations, 1 Northern Arizona University.

Tourism is more than just a business sector; it is an economic driver that crosses multiple industries and supports growth in multiple ways. Here is an illustration: A family from California comes to the Canadian Rockies to ski. They take a flight, rent a car, stay in a lodge and rent snowboards. This is the \"direct\" impact of the visitor economy: local businesses receive money from tourism spending. As a result of this spending, the snowboard rental business is able to make a profit and hire more staff. This \"indirect\" impact of tourism spending produces a multiplying effect as an economic driver by increasing wages, salaries, profits and other business costs. Also, as more visitors come to the ski resort, more work is generated in the supply chain, as wholesalers, food and beverage suppliers, convention planners, retailers, manufacturers, etc., are called upon to meet customers' demands. The new employee hired by the snowboard rental company now has money to spend on clothes, food, transportation, etc., and to pay taxes. This is the \"induced\" impact of the visitor economy. The ripple or spillover effects of this induced impact is felt as income and taxes are spent throughout the province on housing, education, transportation, infrastructure, energy, communication, heath care and other personal costs. The end result is that tourism dollars circulate throughout the economy, amplifying their impact along the way, and resulting in support for community building and economic well-being. The whole province benefits. 3 Travel Alberta Website.

The business offers activities for visitors year-round, and specializes in hiking, snowshoeing, Canyon walks, Ice walks and Medicine walks. Mahikan Trails does both single and multi-day programs and has partnered with another Indigenous company called Painted Warriors and a caving company called Canmore Cave Tours to complement their programs. Brenda Holder has the following advice for aspiring entrepreneurs. Why did you go into business? I went into business because I came to a realization that I was never going to be happy working for someone else. I found that jobs I entered lost their charm very quickly for me and the challenges of the jobs were overcome quickly, and I grew bored and frustrated. So I made the decision to go into business for myself and I've never looked back! What inspired you to run a tourism business? Tourism was the only sensible thing for me to look at building as a business since that is where all my interests and skills were. I also realized that Aboriginal Tourism was one of the fastest growing segments in tourism. 5 Business Link: Indigenous Services. (2017). Is Running a Business For Me? TOURISM SUCCESS STORY What advice would you give to aspiring entrepreneurs? I would say that aspiring entrepreneurs should never be afraid to reach into the community or other similar businesses and seek out advice. And always be confident, even if you don't feel like it sometimes - you have decided on being an entrepreneur for a reason and you have a gift - go for it! What is the biggest lesson you've learned about being in business? My biggest lesson learned was to never give up. Even when things seem like they can't get any worse, suddenly the whole world opens up if you stay with it and don't give up. 12 Archived m ilestone Now that you have completed the Entr epreneur Self-Assessment Tool, write down your answers to why you are a fit with being an entrepreneur.

Regional V isitation: Strong local and regional markets (i.e. high incomes, young demographic). 4. s upport: Excellent support systems exist in Alberta including programs offered by Alberta Culture and Tourism, Travel Alberta, and local Destination Management Organizations. 5. Diversification: Alberta has realized that economic diversification is needed to maintain quality of life and grow the economy. Tourism is a bright spot in the economy and there is strong interest from the public and private sector to invest. To new businesses this means more engaged investors, increased clustering of activities and increased awareness of tourism as an opportunity. 6. c ollaborative: Opportunity to make an impact in your community and collaborate with local businesses. 7.

The opportunity to leverage personal interests and passion into self-employment. c hallenges Alberta's tourism industry is not without its challenges. Some of these are identified below: 1 . s easonality: Due to our cold climate and current visitation trends, many tourism businesses are over-reliant on visitation in July and August. For some businesses this may be acceptable, but others struggle to make ends meet. Seasonality must be strongly considered by every new tourism business owner. 2. Reliance on o il and g as s ector: Alberta's top industry is the Oil and Gas Sector. Although there are many positives to this, during periods where energy prices are high there can be high competition for business inputs including: High competition for labour High competition for available visitor accommodations Higher material and equipment costs High competition for suppliers and vendors 3. l ack of Understanding of the tourism Industry: Although there are excellent examples of Alberta communities who have embraced tourism, there still are many that do not fully understand the industry. This can affect a new business owner as supports and collaborative opportunities may not be as available in all locations. 4. f inancing: Some traditional lenders view tourism as high risk. 14 Archived Activity 2.

It's where Dion Red Gun and his wife Cherylene Bullbear created the business of their dreams, River Ranche Tourism. Here in the peaceful and serene territory, visitors can learn about the outdoors and the Blackfoot culture. Outdoor enthusiasts will enjoy the fly fishing, kayaking, birding and cross country skiing excursions. Those seeking cultural experiences will learn from Siksika Elders who share their knowledge of healing and wellness. Through the Majorville Medicine Wheel Journey through Siksika lands, Elders and members share the interpretationof the stones, dances, stories of the dancing regalia, and significant sites important to the Siksika. Sweat lodge experiences are also available upon request. Dion believes that meeting with visitors and proviing them with experiences is like a dream. His days are filled with \"floating along the Bow River valley where time stands as if it were yesterday, ancient buffalo jumps and untouched beautiful places with peoples who are a living history, or travelling with tourists on wagon trails etched in the prairie.\" This is Dion's dream: to educate Albertans and all visitors about the culture of his people. \"Indigenous peoples now have the opportunity to share our past and present through our stories and ways of discovering new beginnings through tourism,\" says Dion. \"We are very passionate about learning and sharing the great plains and outdoors with visitors from the global community.\" The road to his dream hasn't always been easy, but it's been worth it.

In this section, we will find out what you are selling. Tourism businesses primarily sell experiences. Even if you are sell- ing a tangible product or service, it is really the experience created by the product/service that is motivating customers to make purchases. The demand for experiences has given rise to experiential travel, which is the basis of the modern tourism economy. An experience is something that is personally encounter ed, lived through and affects the individual. It may involve observation or participation; be active or passive, planned or opportunistic, personal or shared.6 Experiential travel is travel that connects you with the essence of a place and its people by engaging visitors in a series of memorable travel activities r evealed over time that are inherently personal, engage the senses and make connections on an emotional, physical, spiritual or intellectual level. It responds to the desire to venture beyond the beaten tourist paths, dive deeper into authentic, local culture, connect with people and enriches their lives. 6 Difference Between Products/Services and Experiences Tourists purchase products (souvenirs, meals) and services (transportation) during their trips, but their major purchases are that of experiences. With some creativity, products and services can be transformed into experiences, which can then be sold at a higher price. For example, purchasing meals at a restaurant is a common product that tourists need. This product can be enhanced into a tourism experience by adding experiential opportunities for customers, such as joining restaurant staff as they collect the local ingredients needed to make their meals, or offering the chance to meet the chef who made their meals. Holistic e xperiences It is important to recognize that a visitor's experience begins from the moment they start researching their trip. The trip reviews they read, the ease of booking, arriving at your business, paying for the experience, and the actual ex-perience itself will all contribute to their overall experience. If any one of these components is negative, it can impact their whole experience. Imagine that a traveller is posting a favourable r eview of your experience on a travel site. What things would you want them to say? __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 6 Tourism Caf\u00e9.

The next step is to understand who will actually take advantage on your offering. This is known as identifying your target markets. T ravel Alberta has identified Free Spirit Millennials as Alberta's primary target market outside the province. Within the province, Cultural Explorers represent another strong market. There are a number of Explorer Quotient traveller types including Cultural Explorers, who are attracted to the types of experiences available in the province. It will be important for you to identify who your business identifies with. Free Spirits and Cultural Explorers may or may not be the right target market for your business. Take some time to become familiar with the various profiles, which are available at https://www.destinationcanada.com/en/tools#explorerquotient. c ultural e xplorers represent 12 percent of global markets. They are always planning for their next trip and are likely to travel with friends and family. They want to immerse themselves in the culture, people and settings of the places they visit. They enjoy the history, but also look to experience modern culture. Prior to every trip, they research their destination to better understand it, and once they are there, they prefer to let things unfold spontaneously. They want their trips to go beyond just seeing the tourist sites, so they strive to leave the beaten path and explore out-of-the-way places. As such, they are considered most likely to visit a rural location in Alberta. f ree s pirits represent 13 percent of global travel markets and come from all demographic groups (age, income education). They are youthful adventurers that come from all over the world, and they are also represented in Alberta's domestic and regional markets. They research their travel destinations, seek trustworthy marketing sources, and plan trip itineraries around Top 10 or \"best of\" lists. They are significantly more likely to visit many locations in a single trip, and share their travel experiences, both online and offline. 39 Archivedmarket characteristics of Alberta's tourism s ector Alberta's tourism industry has many unique market characteristics.

Demand for Tourism Experiences - Aspen Crossing Nestled in the small hamlet of Mossleigh, Alberta is a train-themed destination that is on track to become a true rural gem in the Canadian Badlands. \"We looked at the railway in Stettler that was seeing 20,000 riders a year from a population of 450,000 within 150 kilometres. But within 150 kilometres of our location in Mossleigh, there is a population of 1.8 million. Now, that's potential!\"- Jason Thornhill, Operator, Aspen Crossing Aspen Crossing started as a tree nursery and garden centre. While studying horticulture in University, owner Jason Thornhill realized the pivotal role the railways and horticulture played in drawing settlers to the western prairies. From there, it was an easy decision tying in the railway theme to the garden centre. Over the years, Aspen Crossing has continued to evolve. Visitors come from around the world to experience their offerings that change with each season. Aspen Crossing now includes dining, theatre, a gift shop and a touring railway with over 11 different themed excursions. They also expanded their campground to 120 sites and three unique caboose cabins.

ArchivedQuestion 6: who are your competitors? In this section, we will identify who your competitors are. The existence of competitors signals that there is existing demand for your experience. Having a sound understanding of your competition will help you make key business decisions, such as what your experience will offer and how much you should charge. You will need to consider direct and indirect competitors in order to identify who your competition is. d irect c ompetitors Direct competitors include businesses that offer experiences that are essentially the same as what your business offers. Indirect competitors Indir ect competitors include businesses that offer different experiences that could satisfy the same visitor needs as your experience (see tip below for an example). In tourism, your competitors ar e any business that attracts your primary and/or secondary target markets. This means that they may not even offer the same experiences that you do. For example, horse-drawn sleigh rides and dog sled tours both attract visitors who want to be transported around a destination in a unique way, so they can take in the sights and sounds. These are different experiences, but they both attract similar markets. Take this into consideration when identifying your competition.

ArchivedQuestion 8: How is your experience sold? In this section, we will figure out how your experience is sold. Every business must have a strong understanding of how their products are sold, but this is often overlooked by many new businesses. In general, tourism businesses have two ways to sell their experiences. 1. Sell experiences directly to visitors. 2. Sell experiences through third-party distributors (e.g. travel agencies, tour operators). If you are going to sell experiences directly to visitors, you will need to set up a system to receive payments. Travellers use all kinds of payment methods including cash, credit, debit, e-transfer, etc. The more payment methods you can accept, the more your business will appeal to visitors. Selling directly to visitors allows you to control the visitor interaction, and avoid sales commissions. However, directly selling to visitors increases operating responsibility and could limit your market reach in comparison to working with a third party distributor. Selling through third-party distributors is typically reserved for established businesses who have many years of experience offering high quality experiences and/or services. Third-party distributors can be a powerful method to grow your business because distributors can open up large new markets, increase awareness of your offering, and ultimately increase your sales. If your vision is to grow your tourism business and sell to international markets, building relationships with third-party distributors should be a priority. If you plan to market your experiences inter nationally, your business must be able to meet international travellers' diverse needs and expectations, in addition to being aware of subtle cultural nuances. Travel Alberta has developed an Export Ready Checklist to help tourism businesses determine if they are ready to take that step. The checklist can be found at https://industry.travelalberta.com/marketing/selling-internationally/export-ready-checklist. Dir ectly selling your experiences to visitors generates the maximum profit for your business because there are no commissions for third-party distributors. The simplest and most cost-ef fective way to take bookings on your website is to sell via an online booking engine. This keeps your business open 24/7 and allows you to generate sales while you sleep. 52 Archived Activity 10. How is your experience sold? Describe how your experience will be sold in the space below . Revenue s treams As a tourism business, your main revenue stream may be the sale of your experiences.

T ake some time to think about what your business' main sources of revenue will be. If you can think of other revenue streams your business could have, be sure to write your ideas in the space below.

Some visitors look at price as an important indicator of quality (i.e. \"you get what you pay for\"). Your offerings must be priced consistently, accurately and competitively to be successful in the marketplace. Here are some important considerations when setting your price points. Prices must be high enough to cover expenses and generate an adequate rate of return. Prices must align with what visitors are prepared to pay. Prices must be reassessed regularly, as the marketplace is continually changing. Generally , pricing strategies include the following:8 1. Cost-Plus Pricing - simply calculating your costs and adding a mark-up. 2. Competitive Pricing - setting a price based on what the competition char ges. 3. Price Skimming - setting a high price and lowering it as the market evolves. 4. Penetration Pricing - setting a price low to enter a competitive market and raising it later . 5.

Rat's Nest Cave is home to pictographs, copious mineral formations, and bones that are up to 7000 years old, representing 75 per cent of Alberta's mammals and birds, including the extinct passenger pigeon - leftovers from an ancient Alberta culture. The site comprised an amazing tourism opportunity, but one that faced two complications: improper use by random recreational visitors and the possibility of it being mined in the future. The site was on quarry land owned by Graymont, North America's second largest supplier of lime. The solution? Canmore Cave Tours successfully applied to the Alberta Historical Resources Foundation for protected status as a natural history site. They received the second protected status for natural history given by the Foundation. It turned out that Graymont was appreciative of the application for protected status because it controlled entry into the cave system, eliminating their risk of liability for random visitors. The site is now maintained as a three-way partnership between Canmore Cave Tours, Graymont and the Alberta Historical Resources Foundation. \"We've built good relationships and trust over the years. We've just renewed a five-year agreement.\" Canmore Cave Tours is one of the top-rated attractions in Alberta. It appeals to the FIT segment - Free Independent Travellers. About 6,000 people visit annually, 75 per cent from Alberta.

Canmore Cave Tours TOURISM SUCCESS STORY 66 ArchivedStaffing Plan Some tourism businesses can be successfully run with the only staff member being the owner. However, tourism businesses will often require additional staff to deliver their experiences (e.g. guides, customer service staff, labourers, managers, etc.). If your tourism business will need employees other than yourself, you will need to develop a plan to hire, train and retain employees. T ourism businesses can have seasonal workforces, meaning their employees are only hired for certain seasons throughout the year (e.g. fishing guides in the summer).

Having an understanding of the ongoing costs to operate your business, and how much money your business will need to make to cover these costs is crucial to success. When starting up a new tourism business you will need to have an understanding of the startup costs, operating costs, and how your business is going to pay for these costs. Developing financial pr ojections to estimate these will help give you confidence, and convince potential investors of the soundness of your business idea. o perating c osts Every business needs to have a solid understanding of their operating costs. These expenses are often categorized into fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs are expenses that will occur regardless of the amount of sales generat-ed (e.g. rent, debt servicing, property taxes). Variable costs are expenses that vary with the amount of sales generated (e.g. food and beverage, materials and supplies for the experience).

Activity 18. e stimating your operating revenue. Use the chart below to identify the sour ces of revenue for your business. Seasonality can have a significant impact on the cash flow of your business. For example, some summer businesses incur costs well in advance of the summer season, but will not generate r evenue until well into the summer season. A break-even point occurs when the total operating revenues are exactly equal to the total operating costs. Above this point a profit is generated, and below this point a loss is incurred.

Figuring out your startup costs will allow you to know how much funding you will need to set up your business. Startup costs for tourism businesses typically include one-time, major purchases such as construction, deposits, land improvements and more: registering the business; purchasing property or leasing space; purchasing computers, mobile phones, and business-related software; refining the product or service; paying suppliers; and paying staff salaries. Initial marketing costs related to items like signage and website development must also be considered. Activity 19. e stimating your startup costs.

Thinking back to your answers to Question 10 may help you identify other costs. working c apital: When starting a business, you will need funds to cover your day to day business expenses until you generate enough revenue to cover these costs. To estimate the cash you will need, you will first need to realistically gauge how long it will be to make your first sales. You will then need to determine how quickly you can turn sales into cash and how many days your vendors will give you to pay them. Working capital can be estimated using your answers to Activity 17 (operating costs) in the previous section. c ontingency: Startup costs have a tendency to be larger than initial estimates. That is why it is always a good idea to budget an extra 5-10% for contingency. If you don't end up spending this contingency, then you will have more money to invest back into your business!Startup Costs (pre-opening) Amount Land $ Building $ Equipment $ Renovations $ Furniture/Fixtures $ Vehicles $ Utility Hook-up $ Inventory $ Phone/Cell $ Marketing (exterior/road signs, website) $ o perating (insurance and utility deposits) $ Professional f ees (accountant/lawyer) $ working c apital (see tip below) $ o ther c osts: $ $$ $ c ontingency (see tip below) $ Total $ 76 ArchivedMILESTONE 14 m ilestone Now that you have identified your startup costs, identify them below The annual operating costs of my business are $_________. 77 ArchivedQUestIon 13: HOW WILL YOU FINANCE YOUR BUSINESS? ArchivedQuestion 13: How will you finance your business? In this section, we will look at how you will finance your business. Do you know how much money you will need to set up your business? Will you need extra money to begin operations? Where will you get it? What are pro forma statements and why do you need them? Finding out the answer to each of these questions prior to startup is essential. f inancing n ew tourism b usinesses Starting up a new tourism business requires investment in the form of financing. Depending on the scale and scope of your tourism business idea, you may need additional financing beyond the funding that you currently have on hand. There are many options for financing new tourism businesses, the most common of which are provided below: 1. Personal Sour ces - includes readily accessible financing that the entrepreneur can provide themselves (e.g. cash savings, credit). 2. Family and Friends - includes the personal sources of your family and friends. 3. Investors - includes private investment fr om business angels and venture capital seeking a return on their investment. 4. Bank Loans - includes money that banks lend to entr epreneurs with the requirement that the amount (plus interest) be paid back at some point in the future. 5. Opportunity Development Cooperatives - includes debt or equity financing fr om Opportunity Development Cooperatives. 6. Cr owdfunding - includes money that is raised by collecting small amounts of money from a large number of people. Typically, this is done through crowdfunding platforms on the Internet (e.g. ATB BoostR - see Appendix C). 7. Developmental Lenders - pr ovide loans to businesses who cannot get financing at a bank or credit union (e.g. Community Futures, Business Development Bank of Canada, Futurepreneur). Relying too heavily on personal sour ces, such as credit cards or lines of credit, to start a business can be risky. The interest on credit debt can accumulate quickly and hurt your credit rating - reducing your ability to secure bank financing in the future. Additionally, depleting your savings can leave you exposed. If you have an existing business and you ar e developing a new line of business, you may have retained earn- ings built up that can help finance the new venture. Alternatively, you may have assets that can be used as collateral to obtain new funding. The federal and pr ovincial governments also offer funding opportunities for tourism enterprises through grants, tax incentives, loans and other programs (see pg. 88 - 111 in the Tourism Business Planning Guide). 79 Archived Activity 20. f inancing your startup costs. Now that you have an estimate for how much it will cost to startup your business, you need to figur e out how you will pay for these costs. Use the chart below to help you understand how your startup costs will be paid for. Banks often expect owners to be investing in their businesses befor e they will approve financing, such as loans.

Defensible pr o forma statements are important to have when securing financing from lenders. Most businesses seek assistance from an accountant to complete these statements. Many new business owners feel overwhelmed with the idea of creating financial statements, but it really is as simple as tracking the money that comes in and out of your business to monitor performance. Creating financial statements for your company is a necessary task that will help you know if your company is growing, shrinking or staying flat. Examining the numbers can also help you grow your revenue by highlighting areas for improvement. There are three basic financial statements: Cashflow Statement, Income Statement, and Balance Sheet. Each will be explained in the sections below. Examples of completed financial statements ar e available at the Business Development Bank of Canada' s website: https://www .bdc.ca/en/articles-tools/entrepreneur-toolkit/templates-business-guides/pages/default.aspx If you think that you will need help with financial pr ojections, monitoring, analysis and management, then be sure to employ the services of a qualified accountant or other financial expert. They will be able to help you develop Cash Flow Statements, Income Statements, and Balance Sheets. cash flow statement The cash flow statement is the most important for ecast for a new business because it demonstrates whether or not you have the actual cash on hand needed to meet your financial obligations when they come due. A cash flow statement records the actual timing of cash receipts and cash disbursements: Cash Receipts are cash inflow from cash sales, collections of accounts r eceivable, loan advances, owner's contributions and sales of fixed assets. Cash Disbursements are cash outflows for operating expenses, payments to suppliers for inventory pur chases, repayment of loans and the acquisition of fixed assets. A cash flow statement is not based on accrual account-ing and does not include non-cash items (e.g. deprecia-tion, amortization). See the chart on the next page for a cash flow template that you can use. How to create your cash flow statement: - Select a time period for the cash flow statement. - In the first column (pr e-opening) list the value of things you put into your business and cash you spent on your business before you opened. - In the Cash Receipts section, list how much cash you will receive from revenue, rentals, loan proceeds and any other sources for each month. Note that if you are providing credit terms for your customers that a cash sale is when you collect from your customer. - In the Cash Disbursements section, list how much money you estimate you will be spending each month.(Some categories are given. Can you think of others?) - If your Ending Cash is less than $0 then you must have a plan to deal with it by either investing more, securing an operating loan, collecting receivables, etc. 83 Archivedcash flow statement Itempre- openingjan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec total Opening Cash Balance(a) Cash Receipts: $ $ Sales $ $ Rentals $ $ Loan Proceeds $ $ $ $ $ $ Total cash receipts (b) $ $ Cash Disbursements: Salaries & Benefits $ $ Owner's Salaries $ $ Marketing $ $ Office Supplies $ $ Insurance $ $ Bank Charges $ $ Utilities $ $ Property Taxes $ $ Professional Fees $ $ Repairs/ Maintenance$ $ Land Improvements $ $ Vehicles $ $ Inventory/Supplies $ $ Phone/Cell $ $ Loan Interest $ $ Loan Principal $ $ $ $ $ $ Total Cash Disbursements (c)$ $ Ending Cash (a + b - c) $ $ 84 ArchivedIncome statement An income statement shows the r evenues and expenses of a business given a certain time period. Income statements use accrual accounting to best represent the current state, which means: a) Revenues ar e recorded at the time that the sale is made, even though payment of cash for these sales may occur earlier or later. b) Expenses ar e recorded at the time that their corresponding revenue was recorded, regardless of when the actual outlay of cash was made. Revenues and expenses are projected based on data from your research and reasonable assumptions. Income, expenses and profits are categorized in the income statement as shown in the list below. See the Projected Income Statement on the next page for an income statement template that you can use. Operating Income - income generated from the sale of the company' s products or services. Other Income - income earned from other activities (e.g. inter est earned on bank deposits). Cost of Goods Sold - expenses directly related to the pr oduction of goods and services (e.g. pur chase of materials, freight and labour). Gross Profit - revenue (i.e. operating income + other income) minus cost of goods sold. Operating Expenses - all selling, administrative and depr eciation expenses. Operating Profit - gross profit minus operating expenses. Interest Expense - expenses resulting from debt financing. Net Profit Before Tax - operating profit minus inter est expense. How to create your income statement: - Select a time period for the income statement. - List how much you think you will sell each year . - List how much you think your expenses will be each year (some categories are given - can you think of others?) - Calculate the net pr ofit using the formula in the template. (Revenue minus expenses = pr ofit or loss) 85 ArchivedProjected Income statement Depr eciation: Depreciation recognizes that the value of most assets will decrease over time. It allows a business to r educe its taxable income by the amount of the depreciation of the asset. For example, if a business pur chases a tour bus for $100,000 and expects to use it for 5 years, the business might have a depr eciation expense of $20,000 in each of the five years.

It shows what the business owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and the owners' equity . Assets represent the total resources the business has, stated in dollar terms. Liabilities and equity are claims against these assets. The excess of assets over liabilities represents the net worth of the business. Assets are listed in order of liquidity, which is the ease of converting the asset into cash. This means that cash will be listed first because it is the most liquid. Fixed assets, such as land or buildings, can take a long time to be c onverted into cash so they are listed last. Liabilities are listed in a similar fashion. Current liabilities, such as accounts payable or wages, are listed first. Long term liabilities, such as debt, are listed last. See the chart on the next page for a balance sheet template that you can use. How to create your balance sheet: - Select a time period for the balance sheet. Because a balance sheet is a snapshot of your company at a given time, start the balance sheet at the end of your first year period. - Curr ent Assets o Include the value of any assets that you will likely sell in the next year (accounts r eceivable, inventory - can you think of others?) - Long T erm Assets o Include the value of any assets that you will not likely sell in the next year (pr operty, vehicles, equipment, deposits and pr epaid expenses - can you think of others?) - Curr ent Liabilities o Include the amount of your liabilities you anticipate paying out in the next year . - Long T erm Liabilities o Include the value of any liabilities you ar e not likely to pay of f in the next year. - Owner' s Equity o This is the owner' s value in the company (not the amount invested).
