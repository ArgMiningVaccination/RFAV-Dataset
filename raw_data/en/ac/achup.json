Grounded in the evolutionarily conserved systems of the brain and body, nature appears to function as the fundamental source of wellness along the two vectors of attention and relaxation. Yet, our species is moving away from nature at a time when humanity is just beginning to rediscover its benefits. Conclusions: Exposure to natural environments may provide a \"window\" of healing that can be extended through a continuum of intervention through the use of guided meditation and ultimately hypnotic suggestion. The result may be an improved ability to promote greater executive functioning and more robust immune regulation. The time has come for a more holistic medicine guided by the hand of nature.
