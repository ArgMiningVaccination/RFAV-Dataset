Here's how to obliterate them. For many of us, the pandemic brought a new awareness of how everyday habits like washing hands can mean the difference between getting sick and staying healthy. Cleaning and disinfecting household surfaces and high-touch objects can also protect your health. Doing this regularly will remove most viruses and bacteria from your environment and prevent the spread of disease and illness, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/hygiene/cleaning/index.html). It's important to realize that cleaning and disinfecting are not one and the same, says [Susan Donelan, MD](https://www.stonybrook.edu/experts/profile/susan-donelan), the medical director of healthcare epidemiology at Stony Brook Medicine in New York. \"Cleaning is removing as much visible dirt and material as possible. Cleaning gets rid of the debris and any impurities that are on the surface of whatever it is that you're looking to disinfect,\" she says. Disinfection usually is a chemical-based process intended to kill germs, says Dr. Donelan, adding, \"Cleaning makes the disinfection process more efficient and effective.\" You likely have questions about specifics, starting with the best way to clean your hands. You may also be wondering, how often do you need to clean your cellphone and what's the best way to do it? How should you disinfect the bedding of someone who is sick with COVID-19 or the flu? Experts offer the answers to these and other urgent questions here. How to Wash Your Hands Washing your hands is a crucial way to reduce the spread of a host of viral and bacterial infections. In fact, 4 out of 5 germs that cause illness are spread by hands, according to [Michigan Medicine](https://www.med.umich.edu/ice/info.html). But how often and in what situations is it most important to scrub up? Read on for some basic intel. How Many Germs Are on Your Hands? Your hands are covered with germs, but most don't cause illness. It's estimated that there are between 10,000 and 10 million bacteria on each of your hands, according to the [University of Louisville Health](https://uoflhealth.org/articles/hand-washing-101/). How Frequently Should You Wash Your Hands? How often you need to wash your hands depends on how much contact you have with other people and common high-touch surfaces, and also where you live, says [Anne Liu, MD](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/doctors/l/anne-liu.html), an immunologist and infectious disease doctor and a clinical associate professor at Stanford Medicine in Palo Alto, California. \"If you're home by yourself and you're not going in and out, or you're not around other people, then continue to wash your hands however you normally would. If you work at a hospital, supermarket, or a daycare, you would want to wash your hands very often,\" says Dr. Liu. No Excuses: Times You Should Always Wash Your Hands How Long Can Germs Live on Your Hands? The answer depends on the kind of germ. It's thought that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can last a few hours on your hands, according to [Houston Methodist Hospital](https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2020/mar/how-long-can-coronavirus-survive-on-surfaces/) in Texas. When Should You Wash Your Hands? Frequent hand-washing prevents the spread of germs and illnesses. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html) recommends hand-washing before or after the following activities: - Before, during, and after preparing food - Before eating - Before and after taking care of someone who is sick, especially if they're vomiting or have diarrhea - Before and after treating a wound or cut - After using the toilet - After changing diapers or cleaning up a child or person who has used the toilet - After blowing your nose, sneezing, or coughing - After touching a pet or other animal, or animal feces - After touching pet food or pet treats - After touching garbage During the pandemic, the CDC also recommends washing your hands: - After you've been in a public place and touched things that may be frequently used by other people, such as door handles, gas pumps, and shopping carts - Before touching your eyes, nose, or mouth, since this can be a way the coronavirus enters the body What Are the Best Products for Hand-Washing? A good old-fashioned soap-and-water wash is the best way to get rid of germs on your hands. Unless you work in a healthcare setting, there's no need to use antibacterial soap. Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap, and make sure to include the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails, and then scrub for at least 20 seconds, according to the CDC. Adds Liu, \"Hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol is often more convenient and is very effective for those situations where you don't have the time or access to a sink and soap and water.\" How to Clean and Sanitize Your Phone Most of us touch our phones dozens of times (or more) a day. But a lot of us may never have actually cleaned our phones \u2014 ever. That's unfortunate: According to research out of the [University of Arizona](https://cals.arizona.edu/news/why-your-cellphone-has-more-germs-toilet), cellphones can carry 10 times more bacteria than most toilet seats. How Many Germs Are on a Cellphone? The number of germs on any given phone can vary, but a [study published June 2017 in the journal Germs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5466825/) found more than 17,000 bacterial gene copies on the cellphones of high school students. How Frequently Should You Wipe Down Your Cellphone? The [American Cleaning Institute (ACI)](https://www.cleaninginstitute.org/cleaning-tips/work/cell-phone-cleaning), a trade group that represents product manufacturers, recommends wiping down your phone at least once a day. How Long Can Germs Live on Your Cellphone? Answers vary. [Influenza](https://www.everydayhealth.com/flu/guide/) A and B viruses survive 24 to 48 hours on hard, nonporous surfaces such as stainless steel or plastic, according to a [study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/146/1/47/992812). An [article published April 2020 in The New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMc2004973?articleTools=true) found that the coronavirus could remain active on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for two to three days. However, the risk of [COVID-19 infection](/infectious-diseases/covid-19/) through contact with contaminated surfaces is low, says the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/surface-transmission.html). What Are the Best Products for Cleaning Your Cellphone? When you buy a new device, including a cellphone, you'll usually find cleaning instructions in the pamphlet tucked inside the box. If you've thrown these materials out, look for info on the manufacturer's website. - If you can keep your phone in a wipeable cover, that's always a good choice and can make it easier to clean, says Donelan. - If you can't find the manufacturer's instructions, use an alcohol-based wipe or spray (spray onto a cloth rather than directly onto the phone) to disinfect touchscreens. Make sure the wipe or spray contains at least 70 percent alcohol. - The [Federal Communications Commission (FCC)](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/how-sanitize-your-phone-and-other-devices)advises against cleaning your phone with products that contain bleach or abrasives. How to Clean Your Clothing Clothing doesn't typically pose a high risk of transmitting germs, but in certain situations you will want to wash things with more urgency than you typically would. How Frequently Should You Wash Your Clothing? There's no hard-and-fast rule, but if you've been out and about, especially if you have been exposed to someone with a viral illness, it's a good idea to launder your clothes afterward, according to [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-often-should-you-wash-your-clothes-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/). A typical wash cycle is enough to kill most germs, according to the [University of Arizona](https://news.arizona.edu/story/dirt-laundry-and-how-reduce-your-risk-getting-sick). If someone in the household has a respiratory illness, including COVID-19, it's okay to wash their clothes along with everyone else's. Experts suggest washing the load in hot water (if possible) and using a deep cleaning detergent. Bleach or another sanitizing agent only needs to be used if someone in the household has confirmed infection like a stomach bug (norovirus), and should be used after washing with a deeper cleaning laundry detergent. How Long Can Germs Live on Your Clothing? The viruses that cause colds, flu, and COVID-19 can survive a few days at most on clothing, but germs that cause diarrhea can survive for weeks, per the University of Arizona. What Are the Best Products for Washing Your Clothes? - Standard laundry detergent will rid your clothes of any germs, according to Cleveland Clinic. - Bleach isn't necessary (unless clothes or sheets have been soiled with [vomit](/vomiting/guide/)or feces). - If you have sensitive skin or allergies, find a product that is hypoallergenic, suggests Donelan. How to Clean and Disinfect Your Shoes You may want to clean your shoes if they are dirty or smelly, or if you've stepped in something nasty, but you aren't going to catch COVID-19 from your shoes, says Donelan. How Frequently Should You Wash Your Shoes? You really only need to wash your shoes when they're soiled, says Donelan. When Should You Wash Your Shoes? You may want to wash shoes if they have a bad odor or have mud or debris on them, says Donelan. In that case, use a hose or cleaning tool to get any loose dirt off before you put shoes in the washing machine (once you check the cleaning information on the manufacturer's website \u2014 some footwear shouldn't go into the washing machine). Is It Unsanitary to Wear Shoes in the House? Research has shown that bacteria such as E. coli can be tracked into your home. A [study published in Anaerobe](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1075996414000213?via=ihub) found that shoe bottoms had a high concentration of germs. Taking your shoes off can reduce the likelihood of bringing bacteria indoors, and could be an especially good idea if you live with an infant or toddler, according to the [University of Utah Health](https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/2015/04/what-your-shoes-bring-home). What Are the Best Products for Cleaning Your Shoes? Many shoes that are made mostly of fabric can be put into the washing machine, says Donelan. Look at the shoe manufacturer's website for instructions on how to best clean your shoes. - Antibacterial wipes can be used to clean the bottoms of your shoes. - Antibacterial spray or solution can be used on the bottoms of your shoes. - Washing the soles and sides of your shoes with detergent eliminates bacteria by 90 percent, according to the University of Utah Health. Read the instructions on the bottle to find out how long to leave cleaning solution on any surface, including shoe bottoms, before wiping it off. \"You want to give the solution time to kill the virus or bacteria,\" says Donelan. How to Sanitize Your Doorknobs Experts agree it's important to clean and disinfect high-contact objects such as doorknobs in order to keep germs in check. But what does that mean in practice? How Frequently Should You Wipe Down Doorknobs? Surfaces such as doorknobs that are frequently touched by many people should be cleaned and disinfected at least daily, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html). How Long Can Germs Live on Doorknobs? Different germs last different lengths of time. The flu virus typically lasts on hard surfaces for 24 to 48 hours, according to a [study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6282993/). The coronavirus can last up to five days on a metal doorknob or handle, two to three days on plastic, and two to three days on stainless steel, according to The New England Journal of Medicine. Bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), can survive for weeks, per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mrsa/community/environment/index.html). What Are the Best Products for Disinfecting Your Doorknobs? - Antibacterial wipes or sprays are good for cleaning high-touch surfaces such as doorknobs, says Donelan. Read the label to know how long the product needs to \"dwell\" or remain on the doorknob before you wipe it off. - Alcohol solutions used to clean doorknobs should have at least 70 percent alcohol content. - Diluted household bleach solutions are an option. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/disinfecting-your-home.html)suggests a ratio of 1/3 cup of bleach (containing 5.25 to 8.25 percent sodium hypochlorite) per gallon of water. Don't use the solution after 24 hours because it becomes unstable and may not be effective. Again, make sure you let the solution remain on the doorknob for at least 1 minute. How to Deep Clean Your Bedsheets and Comforters If you share a household with someone who is ill, you may be worried about whether you might get sick, too, from handling their bedding. Here's some reassurance: You don't need to be as concerned about soft surfaces like fabrics as much as hard, high-touch surfaces, says Liu. To find out the best way to clean your bedsheets and comforters, follow the instructions on the tags. If those have been removed, go to the manufacturer's website, says Donelan. If sheets or blankets are heavily soiled (with vomit, for example), make sure you wear gloves when handling them, and scrape or rinse off any gunk before placing things in the wash. \"Don't shake the laundry of a sick person,\" Donelan adds. Sheets should be washed with detergent and hot water at the maximum available cycle, then machine dried at the highest heat setting, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/prevention.html#:~:text=Wash%20laundry%20thoroughly,without%20agitating%20(shaking)%20them.). How Frequently Should You Wash Your Bedding? [Bedsheets should be washed](https://www.everydayhealth.com/healthy-living/how-often-should-you-wash-your-sheets/) at least every two weeks, and more if you sweat a lot during the night, according to the [American Cleaning Institute (ACI)](https://www.cleaninginstitute.org/cleaning-tips/clothes/laundry-basics/do-i-need-wash). How Long Can Germs Live on Your Bedding? Most germs can live on fabric for only about 8 to 12 hours, according to a study published in [PLoS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0027932). The coronavirus is detectable on fabric from up to two days, although that doesn't mean it can infect someone, according to [Hackensack Meridian Health](https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/en/HealthU/2020/08/27/how-long-does-coronavirus-last-on-clothes). What Are the Best Products for Washing Your Bedding? - Standard laundry detergent is the best way to wash bedding that can go into the washing machine, says Donelan. - Unless the sheets have been soiled with vomit or feces (see above) follow the manufacturer's instructions on the best temperature to wash your sheets. - If bedding can't go in a dryer, hang it outside on a clothesline or drape it over chairs to dry, suggests Donelan. How to Clean and Disinfect Your Kitchen What's the best way to make your kitchen more hygienic? Begin with washing your hands: Doing so before cooking and after handling raw meat or poultry can help prevent foodborne illnesses, according to the [U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/handwashing).

How to Clean and Disinfect Your Bathroom It should come as no shock that keeping your bathroom clean and disinfected can help prevent the spread of disease. But you may be surprised to learn which spot in your bathroom has the most germs. How Often Should You Clean Your Bathroom? Disinfect bathroom floors and toilet flush handles three times a week, according to [North Dakota State University](https://www.ag.ndsu.edu/publications/food-nutrition/germ-defense-pyramid/fn-1349-germ-defense-pyramid.pdf). Deep clean and disinfect toilet bowls and bathroom countertops, showers, and tubs weekly. What Is the Dirtiest Part of Your Bathroom? A study conducted by the public health organization [NSF International](https://d2evkimvhatqav.cloudfront.net/documents/2011_NSF_Household_Germ_Study_exec-summary.pdf) tested six different bathroom surfaces, including toilet seats, and found that the spot with the most germs was the toothbrush holder.

An EPA-registered disinfectant will kill any flu-causing germs, per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/school/cleaning.htm). Look at the owner's manual of your car for instructions on the best method for applying the cleaner, and look at the product's label for recommended contact time before wiping off. How Often Should You Clean Your Car? If only you or members of your household use your car and no one is sick, then you can clean your car about as often as you would areas of your house \u2014 about once a week. If you use your car to transport people outside your home, or if you are a rideshare driver, you should clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces in the car at the beginning and end of each ride or shift. If you've given a ride to a person who appears ill, you should open all doors and windows after the ride and clean and disinfect the vehicle, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/tribal/non-ems-transportation.html).

How to Clean and Disinfect Your Baby's Nursery A good rule of thumb is to avoid putting things into a baby's room if you aren't sure how you would clean it if it got dirty, says Donelan. How Often Should You Clean Your Baby's Nursery? You may have to wash the bedding in a nursery more often because of mishaps such as spit-up or a leaky diaper. Make sure you rid the sheet of any bodily fluids before you put it in the washing machine, says Donelan. \"For the most part, you would wash the bedding the same way you would adult bedding. If your child has allergies or sensitive skin, you may want to use a product specifically made for babies,\" she says. Taking shoes off before entering the nursery (or most anywhere around your house where your baby might crawl) can help reduce the volume of germs on the floor, according to research published in the journal Anaerobe. Favorite toys that your child plays with every day should be cleaned once a week or more often if the item is visibly dirty, according to [UT Southwestern Medical Center](https://utswmed.org/medblog/disinfect-toys-during-covid-19/) in Dallas. If your child is ill or any child with an illness has been playing with the toys, they should be cleaned immediately afterward. High-touch areas such as light switches and doorknobs should be washed daily, just as in other areas of the house. What Are the Best Products for Cleaning the Nursery? - Most things that go into a baby's room come with cleaning instructions, whether it's a soft toy, a teething toy, or furniture and bedding, says Donelan. - Although household bleach solutions can be used for hard surfaces in the baby's nursery, note that bleach can irritate the lungs and damage skin, eyes, and clothing, according to the [California Environmental Protection Agency](https://cchp.ucsf.edu/sites/g/files/tkssra181/f/SanitizeSafely_En0909.pdf). Take care in mixing the solution \u2014 wear protective gloves and eyewear. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/disinfecting-your-home.html)suggests a ratio of 1/3 cup of bleach (containing 5.25 to 8.25 percent sodium hypochlorite) per gallon of water. Don't use the solution after 24 hours because it becomes unstable and may not be effective. - Diluted bleach is also a choice for disinfecting washable, nonporous toys (made of materials that don't stain), according to UT Southwestern Medical Center. After cleaning the toy of excess dirt, soak it in the bleach solution for five minutes. Rinse with water afterward and let dry fully before returning it to the nursery. - Board books and wooden blocks shouldn't be submerged in bleach solution or water, ever. Wipe these with an alcohol-based spray or wipe, UT Southwestern Medical Center says. How to Clean and Disinfect Your Remote Controls Remote controls can be germ havens, some of which can survive for hours or even days, according to [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/electronics-computers/remote-controls/how-to-sanitize-your-remote-controls-a1090810463/). Here's what you need to do to sanitize them. (Just remember to take out the batteries first!) How Often Should You Clean Your Remote Controls?

A can of compressed air or a toothpick can help remove debris from crevices, suggests Consumer Reports. How to Clean Your Backpack When not in use, backpacks often end up sitting on the floor or on a bench next to us \u2014 both areas that can harbor germs. Dedicating a space in your house or room for backpacks, coats, and purses can help reduce the risk of spreading infectious microbes to other areas of your home, according to [Carle Health System](https://carle.org/newsroom/staying-healthy/2020/03/keep-your-family-safe-amid-covid-19-concerns).

A study from [Emory University](https://emoryhealthdigest.emory.edu/issues/2018/spring/from_the_well/germs-on-a-plane/index.html) found that people sitting closest to the window had less contact with potentially sick people. How to Disinfect Your Airplane Seat Any nonporous (not fabric) surfaces such as the seat, armrests, seat belts, touchscreens, and light and air controls can be disinfected with any of the EPA's registered antimicrobial products for use against COVID-19, such as alcohol-based wipes or solutions that are at least 70 percent alcohol. Make sure you let the surface stay wet for as long as the labeling on the wipes recommends, otherwise they won't work. If the seat is fabric and visibly soiled or dirty, ask a flight attendant for assistance; they will have access to the appropriate cleaning solutions or may even place you in a different seat. Using wipes on a fabric seat not only makes the seat damp, it could actually help spread germs, according to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/travel/how-to-clean-your-airplane-seat-and-space.html). How to Disinfect Your Airplane Tray Airline trays are nonporous and can be disinfected with the appropriate EPA-recommended product.
