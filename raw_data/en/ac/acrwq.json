One of the most reward - ing experiences for me was the opportunity to present awards to so many deserving individuals, including the prestigious Carol DeMille Award to Stephen Streed. In this issue, you will read about a few of our heroes and their unique and valuable contributions. You'll also hear from Linda Dickey, APIC's Distinguished Service Award winner. Linda's work with several part - ner organizations to bring the perspective of infection prevention to those who design, build, and maintain healthcare facilities cannot be overstated or underestimated. I returned from the conference energized and motivated with a renewed sense of passion for the work I do, and a genuine respect for the incred - ible contributions of others. I also found myself reflecting on the message delivered by plenary speaker Celeste Headlee. There was one quote she offered from Steven Covey that has given me pause to reflect upon my own actions: \"Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.\" In our day-to-day work, all of us are faced with challenges, whether it be a patient issue, a care provider who is concerned over a recent guideline or policy change, or co-workers who may view an approach to an issue quite differently than we do. But, as I have tried to listen more and talk less, I believe that there is an opportunity to come to greater understanding of the needs and priorities of others. This is no easy task, but looking at issues through another's lens may help us develop a richer understanding of our environment and the factors that influence the success of our work. It is common to have a renewed sense of passion for our work after attending a conference, listening to an inspirational speaker, or learning something new. The question is\u2014how do we sustain the energy and enthu - siasm? Sometimes we do not realize what truly engages us until we reflect upon our own activities and what we are drawn to. As I reflect upon my own work, I know that certain interactions or activities are what keep me motivated and excited, particularly when they involve collaborating with colleagues, caregivers, and patients. Each one of us is instinctively drawn to aspects of our work that energize us and ignite our passion. The key is to use that energy to connect to purpose. I am reminded of a quote by Theodore Roosevelt: \" Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.\" Our profession affords us the opportunity to have a tremendous impact on the lives of others. I have interacted with so many \"difference makers\" over the past few months, many of whom you will read about in this issue. As we move forward in our professional lives, let us be inspired by them and use our energy and passion to connect back to purpose and our mission to create a safer world through infection prevention.

PUBLISHED VOLUME 10, ISSUE 3Prevention \"APIC's Program of Distinction is new territory for APIC directed at the facility versus the individual level.\"Building competency and improving standardsIT WAS A THRILL to highlight the new Industry Perspectives platform and a real honor to introduce the APIC\u00ae Program of Distinction during the opening plenary session at APIC 2017. This year's conference drew the largest attendance in the history of APIC with 2,637 clinical attendees and 4,934 total attendees. Industry Perspectives was created to provide a con - venient way to keep up with current and rele - vant information pub - lished and produced by industry for prevention of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). It is intended to build competency in evaluating products and services. I encourage you to visit this site weekly. Its value to you as a user, and to industry as a place to post content, will increase as its utilization increases. APIC's Program of Distinction is new territory for APIC directed at the facility versus the individ - ual level. It is intended to drive improved standards and criteria for infection prevention pro - grams as determined by infection preventionists (IPs), the only role specifically trained in facility-wide infection prevention and control (IPC). IPs are unique in that the primary focus for this role is HAI prevention. The APIC Program of Distinction is both developed and executed by IPs, making it unique in its ability to provide a peer review of your facility's IPC program. We encourage acute care facilities with excellent infection prevention programs to consider applying for the APIC Program of Distinction. We hope that this program will drive standards and performance improvement for all infection prevention programs similar to what Magnet Status has done for nursing. This is a voluntary program that offers a truly peer review opportunity to learn from, and to elevate the visibility of your IPC program and the IP's role within your facility. If your IPC program meets the APIC standards, your facility is eligible to be awarded the APIC Program of Distinction and recognized publicly in a number of ways.

That theme is collaboration. While the absolute core goal of the CBIC Board is to provide a high-quality, current, and secure certification exam process, our focus is also on how we can assist you, our customer. One of the goals determined in our new strategic plan involves exploring research to further the body of evidence that demonstrates the positive connections associated with certification. We understand that this information is valuable to you and your leadership in garnering support for certification. It's not enough that the infection preventionist community understands the importance of CIC\u00ae certification. The larger healthcare executive and consumer audience also needs to have a clear understanding of the benefits. We will be taking several actions in the next two years to move closer to that goal. These include demonstrating value of certification at the prac - tice level, influencing decision makers regarding the importance and value of certification, and defining research questions and pursuing projects to answer those questions related to certification value. If you attended the APIC Annual Conference in Portland this year, then you were able to experience the high level of collaboration with fellow infection preventionists (IPs) as les - sons were shared and knowledge gained from each other. The energy is always inspiring and motivating. So, how can you leverage and continue that collaboration in our shared goal of a skilled and competent IP workforce? By partnering with each other to encourage and foster an expectation of certification as a basic component of a successful infection prevention career. If you are certified, I challenge you to commit to taking an action that will encourage another IP to pursue his or her CIC. It could be as simple as providing a supportive and encouraging comment at your local APIC chapter meeting to a new IP, or as generous as agreeing to share your knowledge and experience in helping to lead a local study group. There is a great list of ideas and inspiration for how to support certification available at www. cbic.org/certification/cic-facilitator-resource-toolkit. If you are not yet certified, I challenge you to explore the support available from your peers and local APIC chapters. A list of resources is available at www.cbic.org/certification/how-to-prepare-for-the-initial-certification-examination . With your list of resources in hand, a written action plan can help ensure you stay the course to achieving your goal of becoming CIC certified. In the spirit of partnership and collaboration, we would love to hear from you. Let CBIC know what you are doing to support certification by emailing your story to info@cbic.org . We would love to highlight your efforts in future newsletters and articles, as well as on the CBIC website so we can keep the theme of collaboration going.

Visit the Heroes web page to read profiles of each Hero. The first three write-ups appear in this issue; the remaining Heroes will be profiled in the winter issue. www.apic.org/About-APIC/ Awards/Heroes . Establishing a sustainable, proactive approach to reduce sharps injuries MARY JO BELLUSH developed a comprehensive, proac - tive campaign that significantly reduced the num - ber of sharps injuries across her hospital system. In 2013, Lean methodology revealed that blood and body fluid (BBF) injuries were the number one OSHA preventable injury at Excela Health. Research showed that the hospital sys - tem had an entirely reactive approach to these injuries. \"There were no preventions in place, no standardization for safety-device use, and employees were unsure about how to report an injury,\" Bellush said. Leveraging Lean methodology again, she set out to identify root causes of the hospital's injuries. Mandatory roundtable reviews of every injury revealed that 95 percent were caused by employees rushing through tasks and not always following proper procedures. Misuse of safety devices was another issue. As one example, the infection prevention and control (IPC) team discovered that surgeons were breaking the safety covers off needles during surgery because they obstructed their view of the surgical site. \"Once we identified these injuries as preventable, we were able to make them a strategic priority for the organization,\" Bellush said. The IPC team created a proactive campaign that emphasized safety awareness, continuous improvement, and prevention. Safety is now a topic in daily Lean meetings. At quarterly breakfasts, senior leadership and safety advocates review injury statistics and causes, and identify steps to prevent them. A \"Safer Medical Device\" task force also meets quarterly. To standardize safety procedures and educate frontline staff, the IPC team made step-by-step instructional documents available online, and created a website page that allows employees to submit safety concerns and device suggestions. Surgeons participated in mandatory training to understand their safety-device options. When an injury does occur, the IPC team distributes a safety memo to ensure staff learn from it. Between 2014 and 2016, BBF injuries decreased by nearly 50 percent, even as the hospital's staff grew. \"Collaboration and stan - dardization at all levels really helped us be successful,\" Bellush said. MARY JO BELLUSH, MSN, RN, CIC EXCELA HEALTHGREENSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA Making patients safer through leadership and innovation KATIE CARY WORKED as a medical technologist in microbiology for six years before deciding she wanted to become more involved with the com - plete spectrum of patient care. Yet she had dif - ficulty transitioning into the IPC field until she met a nurse who recognized the value of her expertise and took a chance on hiring a medical technologist with no IPC experience. Since then, Cary's commitment to be at the forefront of IPC has reaped benefits for her hos - pital, her patients, and the Colorado infection prevention com - munity. Known for being an early adopter, Cary advocates for conducting thorough research, and then gathering the evidence and support necessary to try new IPC technologies and tech - niques. \"When you're not seeing improvement, you have to do things differently or you're not going to get better,\" she said. \"This approach has really paid off for our team at Presbyterian/St. Luke's, allowing us to be progressive while providing the safest patient care.\" One of Cary's early successes was the introduction of alcohol- impregnated caps for central lines, part of an effort to reduce CLABSI in bone marrow transplant patients. The evidence was strong, but the product was expensive and not yet widely utilized. Ultimately, the caps helped the hospital reduce CLABSI in this population by 65 percent. Cary advises other infection preventionists (IPs) who want to innovate to \"be brave and be visible.\" She also emphasizes building relationships to gain support: \"You need to bring people with you and inspire them to make patient safety a priority. If you grow programs from the ground up, and involve all key stakeholders, everybody has a piece in wanting initiatives to be successful.\" Cary also makes mentoring a priority: \"I love mentoring people coming into the field because I remember what it was like to be a new IP. The best resources can and should be our peers.\" KATIE CARY, MPH, MT(ASCP), CIC PRESBYTERIAN/ST. LUKE'S MEDICAL CENTERDENVER, COLORADOwww.apic.org | 15 Creating a foundation to support infection prevention excellence THE DIGNITY HEALTH infection prevention team has systematically built an IPC structure that supports infection prevention pro - grams and improved patient outcomes in 39 facilities across three states. Despite differences in geography, culture, and professional experience levels across their facilities, the team has successfully standardized critical infection prevention processes and systems, enabling Dignity Health to achieve key CMS goals and internal infection-reduction targets. The team started by providing policy templates to their local facilities, and progressed to evidence-based policies that each facility is mandated to adopt. \"We made a big push when we realized our facilities were asking for policy and procedure guidance,\" Marcy Maxwell said. The team also created an infection prevention coun - cil to develop outcomes-driven action plans that supported policy implementation. \"We tried to develop specific plans that everyone could implement at the same time and that could be measured continuously,\" said Julie Wardinsky. Participation in the CMS Partnership for Patients Hospital Engagement Networks (HEN) has given the Dignity Health team additional support, motivation, and resources. To audit and coordinate the HEN initiatives, the team successfully introduced \"MeasureVentionists\"\u2014specially trained nurses who provide peer- to-peer bedside coaching. Working together, MeasureVentionists and Dignity Health infection preventionists reduced the system's CAUTI and CLABSI rates by 40 percent. The HEN contract also gave the Dignity Health team time for facility visits to focus on implementation of current initiatives. \"You can't help change things if you don't understand the local culture and challenges,\" said Wendy Kaler. \"On-site visits also made our local IPC staff feel supported.\" While the system-wide foundation that the Dignity Health infec - tion prevention team created has many components, Roy Boukidjian can succinctly summarize the key to their success: \"Mutual respect is really how you make this happen.\" DIGNITY HEALTH SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA CMS mandates water management programs in all healthcare facilities ON JUNE 2, 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released a policy memorandum to mandate water management programs in all healthcare facilities to reduce Legionella risk. This memorandum is addressed to hospitals, critical access hospitals, and long-term care. However, it is also intended to raise awareness of the issue in all healthcare organizations. CMS expects Medicare-certified healthcare facilities to imple - ment water management programs, including policies and pro - cedures, to reduce the risk of growth and spread of Legionella and other opportunistic waterborne pathogens in building water systems. Healthcare facilities are expected to comply with the CMS requirements to protect their patients. Facilities failing to demonstrate measures to minimize the risk of Legionnaires' disease are at risk of citation for non-compliance with the CMS Conditions of Participation. The Winter 2017 issue of Prevention Strategist will publish an article including more detailed information about these CMS-mandated water management programs and highlight the role of infection control for this program.NHSN's upcoming re-consent AN UPDATED NATIONAL HEALTHCARE SAFETY NETWORK (NHSN) Agreement to Participate and Consent will be introduced with the December 2017 NHSN release. The Consent updates the purposes of NHSN to reflect an evolving and growing system; therefore, primary contacts at all participating facilities must review and agree to the stated purposes by re-consenting sepa - rately for each component. A facility executive's signature is no longer necessary, and the Consent includes an attestation that the primary contact is authorized to bind the facility to its terms. The updated purposes include provisions enabling the CDC to provide patient- and facility-level data to CMS as required for use in quality improvement programs and program administra - tion, health departments during an outbreak investigation, and facility-level data to local health departments for surveillance and prevention purposes. In December, all facility administrators and primary contacts will be notified that the Consent form is available. NHSN functionality will be disabled if the primary contact does not accept the Consent form by the Feb. 24, 2018, deadline. The CDC will communicate with users throughout this process to minimize any disruption to reporting. Please contact NHSN@ cdc.gov with any questions.16 | FALL 2017 | Prevention BRIEFS TO KEEP YOU IN-THE-KNOW GET THE LATEST data on IP practices and competencies, organizational structure, and compensation in reports from the APIC MegaSurvey , the largest survey of the IP workforce.

The Intensive model is designed to reach underserved areas across the U.S., with a compressed immersion course on infection prevention fun - damentals. The class size is kept small to provide an intimate setting that encourages dialogue and networking. Recently, Prevention Strategist had the opportunity to talk to Marcia Patrick, one of the faculty members who taught the first course in Milwaukee in August. Here's what she had to say: HOW IS THIS COURSE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER AMBULATORY CARE COURSES OFFERED BY APIC? The ASC Intensive combines the best of APIC's signature Infection Prevention for Ambulatory Surgery Centers courses\u2014ASC 101 and 102\u2014into a four-day format. One of the key sessions is the risk assessment\u2014participants work with others from similar facilities to develop their facility-specific risk assessment, goals, and objectives for their program. This becomes the basis of the infec - tion prevention and control program (IPC). WHO IS THE COURSE DESIGNED FOR? Anyone working in an ambulatory setting will benefit from this course. The course is designed for IPs at ASCs, but we get a wide range of participants, including nurs - ing managers, administrators, physicians, medical assistants, and surveyors. We have some facilities that send their IPs to the course every year. We do update the material on an ongoing basis to ensure it is current and pertinent. WHAT TYPES OF PRACTICE SETTINGS IS THE COURSE CONTENT APPLICABLE TO? While the title ASC refers to ambulatory surgery centers, the course is appropriate for most ambulatory settings\u2014gastroin - testinal centers, specialty surgical facili - ties like pain or ophthalmology, and even primary care, as the concepts and practices are similar. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CURRENT TRENDS AND CHALLENGES IN AMBULATORY CARE THAT THIS COURSE ADDRESSES? The faculty has seen tremendous growth in IPC knowledge since we started in 2009. In the beginning, some of the practices out there were extremely deficient and dangerous to patients. As the years have gone by, we're seeing fewer of the most egregious lapses, and it is becoming more \"fine tuning\" of programs, and understanding the nuances of a robust IPC program.While the principles of IPC remain the same regardless of setting, how we opera - tionalize these in the ambulatory setting can be different from hospitals. There are also issues that are uniquely ambulatory- focused. Probably one of the greatest chal - lenges is around cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of instruments and devices like endoscopes. Practice gaps can lead to bad outcomes. Understanding and following the basic principles around these are criti - cal. Likewise, surveyors are looking for the facility risk assessment as the basis of the IPC program. Another area we address is construction\u2014 so many facilities are undergoing construc - tion or significant renovation. The IP must be at the table from the start of the project for two main reasons: to ensure the construction or renovation plan takes into account infec - tion prevention issues with the design and furnishing of the new or renovated space, Marcia Patrick, MSN, RN, CIC, FAPIC, teaching at the ASC Intensive course in Milwaukee.

Elaine Larson honored as 'Living Legend' ELAINE LARSON, P hD, RN, CIC, FAAN, FAPIC, received the highly acclaimed designation of Living Legend from the American Academy of Nursing. One of five individuals deemed exceptionally accomplished in nursing and healthcare over the course of their careers, Dr. Larson will officially receive the Academy's high - est honor at a special ceremony during its policy conference in Washington, D.C. in October. Dr. Larson is an international expert in infec - tion prevention, antimicrobial resistance, and hand hygiene, and is the only infection pre - ventionist who received this honor. Her con - tributions have changed the way healthcare is delivered by emphasizing the importance of infection prevention and hand hygiene for all health professionals. The interdisciplinary nature of her work is evident in the breadth and wide dissemination of her 500 scholarly publi - cations. She has served on prestigious national advisory groups and grant review panels, and generously mentored countless clinical research nurses. Currently a professor and associate dean for research at Columbia University School of Nursing and Mailman School of Public Health, Dr. Larson has been the editor of the American Journal of Infection Control since 1995.and that proper barrier controls are used during the demolition and construction activities, especially if this is occurring in existing patient care spaces. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE WAYS TAKING THIS COURSE COULD DIRECTLY BENEFIT HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WORKING IN THE AMBULATORY CARE SETTING? Patient safety, patient safety, patient safety! And employee safety as well! Attendees leave with a set of tools to take home to use: the risk assessment as noted above, a checklist of items to look for when making rounds, lots of practical application examples, and the best practices to keep their patients and staff safe. They learn ways to identify and reduce risks, and to be ready for an accreditation visit or a CMS survey. Continuous readi - ness is emphasized, not the \"all hands drill\" because a survey is due. We provide our email addresses to participants so if they have questions when they get home, we're available as a resource. This course helps IPs identify substan - dard or dangerous practices that could put patients or staff at risk, and teaches best practices to ameliorate those risks. We pro - vide the references that best practices are based on, and enumerate the references the IP must have to be effective. Visit www.apic.org/ASC-Intensive for more information.

I was working as an epidemiologist at a health depart - ment when a position was announced. I was deeply interested in that position because it involved working with the healthcare facilities on healthcare associated infections. They wanted someone certified in infection control, so I decided to get my CIC. Q: HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN AN IP? I have been an epidemiologist since 2002 and received my CIC in 2016. Q: WHY IS MAINTAINING BOARD CERTIFICATION IN INFECTION CONTROL (CIC) IMPORTANT TO YOU? Because we deal with outbreaks of different diseases at various healthcare facilities, it's very important to understand infection prevention and control. Studying for, and obtaining, a CIC helps a lot for that. Q: HOW DID YOU PREPARE FOR THE CIC EXAM? I attended lectures hosted by Texas Department of State Health Services and used APIC's Certification Study Guide .Q: IN WHAT WAYS HAS YOUR CIC BENEFITED YOU? Now I am more confident in providing recom - mendations for infection prevention and control to our facility and our patients. Q: IN WHAT WAYS HAS YOUR CIC BENEFITED YOUR FACILITY? I work for a health department and frequently communicate with healthcare facilities on issues of infec - tion prevention and control. The employees I work with in epidemiology benefit from my collaborative perspective on infection prevention. Q: WHAT IS THE BEST ADVICE YOU HAVE EVER RECEIVED? WHAT IS THE BEST YOU HAVE EVER GIVEN? \"Wash your hands and kill the germs.\" Q: CAN YOU SHARE SOME STUDY TIPS FOR OTHERS WHO WISH TO MAINTAIN OR PURSUE THEIR CIC DESIGNATION? Getting the Certification Study Guide is a good start. Experience in healthcare will also prove useful. \"Wash your hands and kill the germs.\"CAPITOL COMMENTS Engaging chapters in advocacy BY RICH CAPPARELL, NANCY HAILPERN, AND LISA TOMLINSON APIC'S 113 DOMESTIC chapters are the back - bone of our advocacy efforts and the most important way for APIC to communicate with members. Through its chapters, APIC works to communicate with legislators and regulators to express the on-the-ground needs of infection preventionists (IPs) and the importance of government funding for infection prevention programs. Although outreach methods can vary, it is important to understand that every time members speak with policymakers, they are helping them form an understanding of healthcare and the role of IPs. This article is going to explore some ways chapters have engaged their poli - cymakers and introduce advocates who were fundamental to these outreach efforts. SEND LETTERS TO CONGRESS A major part of APIC advocacy efforts is focused on sending emails to members of Congress. The emails are pre-written mes - sages by APIC and are delivered using an online platform to members' congressional delegations. Messages can be sent in less than two minutes by simply filling out an online form with some simple biographical information (address, phone number, zip code, etc.). Using this system, APIC and its chapters have engaged thousands of advo - cates from across the country to contact their members of Congress in 2017.Each year, to promote letter-writing efforts, APIC launches its Voice for Infection Prevention (VIP) Advocacy Challenge. The VIP Challenge is a competition between states to see who can get the highest percent - age of members to contact their legislators. Chapter legislative representatives (CLRs) are a central part of this effort, as they promote the competition to their chapters and encour - age members to participate. The competi - tion is launched every spring and ends when Congress successfully passes appropriations for the Department for Health and Human Services. For more information on how to get your chapter involved in this competition, email legislation@apic.org . For the last two years, Troy Cutler, RN, CIC, of the Pine Tree Chapter in Maine, has successfully engaged more than 65 percent of his members to send letters to their members of Congress. When asked how he has consistently outperformed other states in the VIP Challenge, Troy responded, \"The VIP competition really speaks to my competitive side and motivates me to engage our members. My chapter hosts a meeting every month at my facility which is centrally located in the state. At every meeting, I bring my laptop and go person- to-person asking them to fill out the latest action alert. Many people have their own [laptops], but the contact encourages them to take action at the meeting. We also have a robust listserv of IPs in the state. I work with our chapter secretary to contact IPs with any new messages from APIC Headquarters and provide screenshots of step-by-step instructions of how to take action. Finally, I follow up with everyone at the next meeting asking them if they got the email and have taken action.\"\"Each year, to promote letter-writing efforts, APIC launches its Voice for Infection Prevention (VIP) Advocacy Challenge.

Chapters that are interested in becoming more engaged in advocacy should contact the APIC Government Affairs team at leg- islation@apic.org . HOST A POLICYMAKER AT YOUR CHAPTER MEETING APIC chapter meetings provide an oppor - tunity for members to network, learn about the latest regulations or legislation, receive CEUs, develop leadership skills, and get involved in volunteer opportunities. They are also a great way to hear different speakers present at your local chapter. Policymakers appreciate invitations to speak at chapter meetings because the dis - cussion has a predictable focus and allows them to interact with potential voters around that issue. While legislator-organized town hall meetings can be contentious, APIC chapters provide an audience where people want to discuss healthcare through the on- the-ground experiences of IPs and their patients. These speaking opportunities offer policymakers feedback on their healthcare proposals and are a great way to create rela - tionships with IPs in the district. HOST A LEGISLATIVE DAY AT YOUR STATE CAPITOL State legislation provides another impor - tant opportunity for advocacy. State legis - latures introduce thousands of bills a year and pass hundreds more bills than Congress in a session. With legislation moving at a faster pace, and without the help of subject matter experts, state legislation can often have unintended consequences to IPs and patients. This makes advocacy on a local level an important role for chapters. To help educate lawmakers, chapters can organize legislative days at their state capitols. During these visits to the Capitol, chapter members meet with legislators and their staff to discuss key issues or simply introduce the field of infection preven - tion. These events are a great way to get members engaged in the legislative pro - cess and to create relationships with state policymakers. Some states combine their chapter meetings with their legislative days to create more incentive for participation. These highlights are just a few of the ways chapters can engage their members in advo - cacy. APIC's Advocacy Toolkit is a great resource to help plan legislative days and request meetings with legislators. The toolkit can be found at https://apic.org/Advocacy/ advocacy-toolkit . We can help you develop a well-oiled \"machine\" like California or Mary Virgallito, RN, MSN, CIC, FAPIC, is the president of the Greater Los Angeles Chapter and a former member of the APIC Public Policy Committee. Mary has organized multiple legislative days as the former CLR for the California APIC Coordinating Council (CACC). CACC connects APIC chapters across the state of California. Mary shared a little about her first experience on a legislative day in Sacramento. \"I have always been interested in government affairs and the impact it has on healthcare. During my first trip to Sacramento with CACC in 2011, I was nervous like most first-time visitors. However, I quickly gained my confidence by watching the incredible efficiency of Cheryl Richardson, the CACC CLR [at that time]. She gathered everyone on the steps of the Capitol building, gave us our marching orders, provided talking points, and handed out kits to leave with legislators. I have helped put together many legislative days since 2011, but I still remember how great it felt to be a part of a well-oiled machine.\" Ann Marie Pettis, RN, BSN, CIC, FAPIC, is a member of the APIC Board of Directors and a past president of the Rochester Finger Lakes Chapter. Her chapter hosted U.S. Representative Louise Slaughter at their August meeting to discuss antimicrobial stewardship. Ann Marie shared some of her experience about the process of setting up the meeting. \"My chapter has been lucky to host a couple of policymakers at our meetings. This year, we reached out to Representative Slaughter's office because of her background as a microbiologist and her interest in antibiotic use in animals. Her staff responded quickly to our inquiry and requested about a week to confirm the congresswoman's availability. Representative Slaughter gra - ciously accepted our invitation and scheduled an hour to address the chapter and take questions from members. Using the APIC Advocacy Toolkit as a guide and the support of the congressional staff, we were able to confidently and efficiently prepare for this meeting. Overall, the process for scheduling this speaker was easy and something I encourage all chapters to do.\" Members of the Rochester Finger Lakes Chapter with U.S. Representative Louise Slaughter.\u00a92017 PDI PDI07179338 PATIENT CARE ENVIRONMENT OF CARE INTERVENTIONAL CAREIntegrated Solutions to Help Fight HAIs.

Q&A WITH LINDA DICKEY, RN, MPH, CIC, FAPIC LINDA DICKEY is the senior director of quality, patient safety, and infection prevention at the University of California Irvine Healthcare. She received the 2017 President's Distinguished Service Award at APIC's 44th Annual Conference. Linda has served as APIC faculty, an ambassador, and a contributor to the APIC Text Online. We asked Linda to share some insight into her role with APIC and her thoughts on being a leader. Q: How did you get involved in APIC? I joined APIC in 1994 after being hired as an infection control practitioner in the Orlando area. My supervisor and all of my peers were APIC members; it was a professional expecta - tion to belong to APIC and become certified after gaining experience in the field. Q: How has your experience within APIC translated to your work as an IP? APIC has directly affected my work in myr - iad ways. I learned the practice of infec - tion prevention from my peers in APIC and from APIC resources, such as the APIC Text and various practice guidance documents. Serving for APIC in national, state, and local roles has provided experience to serve in both leadership and participant roles, increas - ing skills such as evaluation of published literature, communication with other disci - plines, improved listening, and confidence in public speaking. APIC has provided insight and support on legislative issues that have directly affected my work. My affiliation with APIC has allowed me the opportunity to serve as a voice for infection prevention with other groups, such as ASHE and FGI, to help other disciplines understand a bit more about how we can best partner. Q: What does leadership mean to you? It means providing support and direction\u2014 setting priorities and having a vision.Q: What is your leadership style? Collaborative (at least I hope so). I try to vet things with the people who are a part of whatever team I'm working with. And, I try to address any concerns or be open if someone has a different opinion to see if we need to go in a different direction. However, there are definitely times when you have to move forward and without getting everyone's buy-in. Q: What are some challenges you faced as a leader? Conflicting opinions, having to lead people through change, all of us having to work differently, and having to let go of things that we feel we can't let go of or take on new things\u2014these include behavior changes and workflow changes. I've found that the hardest part is when people have to really let go of a place of comfort. It's hard for me too\u2014especially if it is hardwired. I'm always trying to improve my ability at seeing the bigger picture and someone else's point of view, and try to build a shared men - tal model of what it is we're trying to achieve. It's difficult at times to be able to articulate the bigger picture in a succinct way. Q: What are some leadership lessons or advice you can share from your work and management experiences in infection prevention? If there is any one skill that I (or anyone in a position of leadership) could improve upon it would be to learn how to listen. Also, to \"Serving for APIC in national, state, and local roles has provided experience to serve in both leadership and participant roles, increasing skills such as evaluation of published literature, communication with other disciplines, improved listening, and confidence in public speaking.\" 28 | FALL 2017 | Prevention learn how to build the soft skills\u2014emotional intelligence, manag - ing our own emotions, building a win-win\u2014in the environment that we work in, but they're critical skills to being successful in any capacity. Leadership is lateral; we're not just leading people who report to us, but even people that are above us and parallel to us in terms of hierarchy. Q: What have been some defining moments of your career? The first one was when the individual who encouraged me to con - sider a career in infection prevention handed me a copy of the APIC Text\u2014it used to be call the APIC Curriculum \u2014and said here, read this and see what you think. Even back then it was a five-inch thick binder! The material told me about the scope of the field, and it was fascinating to me. Another defining moment was getting involved with APIC. There are a lot of professional associations out there, but becoming involved in APIC is truly how I learned my job. APIC has resources (human and educational) that have helped me to do my job. Relocating from a community organization in central Florida to an academic medical center in California was another pivotal experience in my career because the challenges of each setting are so different. And, most recently, I have taken on quality and patient safety as well as infection prevention as part of my scope of work. Q: Who helped you along the leadership journey? Judene Bartley\u2014She saw things in me that I would never have seen, probably still don't see. Denise Murphy\u2014She helped me get my job in California and was always a resource. Hazel Ferwerda\u2014My first boss. She saw that infection preven - tion would be a fit even before I saw it was a fit! Susan Huang\u2014Current medical director for our infection prevention program; an outstanding model for emotional intelligence. Q: Do you have any advice for an IP looking to enhance their leadership skills or get more involved in APIC? Do whatever you can to advance your communications skills (public speaking, writing, etc.). Get involved in your local APIC chapter and grow your leader - ship skills. TalentSmart has great resources for emotional intelligence. Don't forget opportunities outside of work that could help you grow in leadership ways that you can translate to your work place.

She has presented on topics includ - ing infection control aspects of construction/renovation and ambulatory care, as well as MRSA, CRE, influenza, and regulatory issues. Mary Alice is currently working as an APIC consultant for CDC-funded projects with the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Chicago Department of Public Health. \"Audits are essential to identifying gaps in practice. The role of audits and feedback is to assist in sustaining competency, provide assurance of policy implementation, and use the data to inform performance improvement activities.\"1. Could you give us a short bio of yourself? I graduated from Marquette University with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Loyola University Chicago School of Law with a Master of Jurisprudence in Health Law. I became a member of APIC in 1983 and became a Fellow of APIC last year in 2016! I'm the vice-chair of the Public Policy Committee, and have served as the nominating chair, chapter legislative representative, and president of the Chicago Chapter of APIC. 2. Could you explain what ICAR visits are to our readers? Infection control assessment and response, or ICAR, assessments are funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Each state and several city health departments received funding to complete ICAR assessments. In Illinois, both the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Chicago Department of Public Health received grant funds. Each health department determined which facilities would be assessed. The goals of the assessments are to: Identify any gaps in the infection prevention and control programs and infrastructure; Provide education and training; and Assist facilities in detecting, preventing, and responding to healthcare-associated infec - tions and multidrug-resistant organisms across the continuum of care. 3. What are the benefits of performing an ICAR assessment? As a consultative service, it allows an outside look at the facility to help them identify their strengths and opportunities for improvement. Recommendations, suggested interven - tions, and resources are provided to the facility via just-in-time discussions and a formal follow-up summary report. Each assessment also allows the consultant to learn something new or hear a unique approach the facility has implemented. Those best practices can then be shared with other facilities. 4. What occurs before, during, and after an ICAR assessment? A pre-assessment call is held before all visits to learn more about the facility and the infection prevention and control program. Setting-specific tools were created to collect more detailed information on the infection prevention and control program infrastructure, and measures to control multidrug-resistant organisms. During the visit, the CDC setting-specific ICAR tool is completed. In Illinois, we have created supplemental tools that are completed in a tracer format to learn more about practices related to sterilization and disinfection, wound care, and ventilator-related care. Following the assessment, the facility receives the completed ICAR tool and a summary report. Occasionally, an additional visit to the facility follows if they would like support for 30 | FALL 2017 | Prevention time of the audit, audit feedback to frontline staff provides aware - ness for all staff of the gaps, interventions, and improvement efforts. 7. Why is it important that facilities take advantage of these ICAR assessments? Most importantly, the assessments are aimed at improving patient, resident, and healthcare provider safety. Additionally, the collective data will assist the CDC with developing guidelines and educational materials to address the identified gaps. 8. What is one area that most facilities could use training in? Training needs are specific to setting types. However, injectable medication diversion as an infection prevention and control concern has not been recognized by all setting types. Ensuring that infection preventionists are included in assessments of suspected injectable medication diversion is a key patient/resident safety measure. 9. Anything else that is important to add? In just over 12 months, 125 facilities have participated in the Illinois/Chicago ICAR process. While some facilities have been reluctant at first to sign up for an assessment, overall, they have found the experience beneficial. APIC CONSULTANT CORNER implementation of the suggested recommendations. Analysis of data from the CDC ICAR tools and the supplemental tools created by the team have helped to guide educational offerings at the state level. 5. Can you describe the structure of the APIC Consulting team for the state health department client? All the consultants performing ICAR assessments in Illinois/ Chicago are nurses. There are five full-time consultants and three consultants who perform assessments intermittently. The assessment team is supported by an advisor; two data managers; four subject matter experts providing Ebola, dialysis, data validation, and educa - tion related assistance; and the APIC Consulting staff. The team has an amazing 220 years of collective experience, with specialties in long-term care, ambulatory care, dialysis, and Ebola. 6. Can you discuss some of the trends that you and the team have identified? The trends in Illinois across all care settings have focused on audits and feedback. Audits are essential to identifying gaps in practice. The role of audits and feedback is to assist in sustaining competency, provide assurance of policy implementation, and use the data to inform performance improvement activities. Audit data must be collected on a routine basis and in a systematic way. While just-in-time feedback is beneficial to the individual observed at the AC18_CallforAbstracts_PS_Hpg_Fall'17_1.indd 1 8/11/2017 4:19:23 PM 880227_Editorial.indd 1 15/08/17 11:26 YOUR NEEDS Blood Collection SetVanishPoin t\u00ae Blood Collection Safe\u00ae Syring eEasyPoint\u00ae Retractable Needle Activated require disposal space than other safety syringes & prevent disposal-related injuries.

Unfortunately, the ability to treat gonococcal infections may soon become more challenging, as it is developing antimicrobial resistance. N. gonorrhoeae is a Gram-negative diplococcus named for Albert Neisser, who discovered the organism in 1879.1 The organism has a classic double-bean shape, as seen on the Gram stain. The major - ity of cases are transmitted during sexual intercourse. Fun factoid: Gonorrhea is also known as \"the clap\"; this term is from the French for \"clappoir,\" also known as a brothel. Who knew? SIGNIFICANCE AND RISK FACTORS This organism is found only in humans, and it can infect the cer - vix, uterus, fallopian tubes, urethra, mouth, throat, and anus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that N. gonorrhoeae is evolving into a \"superbug\" with resistance to antimicrobials that are commonly recommended for treatment. This a major public health concern of global proportions. 2 The WHO also predicts that due to an extraordinary inherent capacity of gonorrhea to develop and retain antimicrobial resistance, it is likely that increasing resistance will occur in the future and that severe complications will emerge in what they term a \"silent epidemic.\" 2 EPIDEMIOLOGY Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported notifiable disease in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and MY BUGABOO GREETINGS FELLOW INFECTION PREVENTIONISTS! THE SCIENCE OF infectious diseases involves hundreds of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. The amount of information available about microbial organisms poses a special problem to infection preventionists (IPs). Obviously, the impact of microbial disease cannot be overstated. Traditionally, the teaching of microbiology has been based mostly on memorization of facts (the \"bug parade\"). Too much information makes it difficult to tease out what is important and directly applicable to practice. This quarter's My Bugaboo column features information about the emergence of resistance in the human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae . The intention is to convey succinct information to busy IPs for common etiologic agents of healthcare-associated infections. Please feel free to contact me with questions, suggestions, and comments at irena@case.edu .Neisseria gonorrhoeae: BY IRENA KENNELEY, P hD, RN, CNE, CIC, FAPICEmerging resistance patterns pose a global threat www.apic.org | 33 Prevention (CDC) reported that in 2014 there were 350,062 cases reported. While the symptoms for men and women are dif - ferent, many never even develop symptoms. For men, the infection typically begins to show symptoms a week after its transmis - sion. The first noticeable symptom is often a burning or painful sensation during uri - nation. As it progresses, other symptoms may begin to appear. In women, gonor - rhea infections can appear much like com - mon vaginal yeast or bacterial infections. Unfortunately, infections with gonorrhea are a cause of pelvic inflammatory dis - ease in women, which can lead to serious reproductive complications. Tubal infertil - ity, ectopic pregnancy (a life-threatening condition), and chronic pain can result. In males, undetected and untreated gonor - rhea can infect the epididymis, which may lead to sterility. Treatment has become challenging due to the absence of routine antimicrobial testing for gonorrhea, the ongoing evolution of antimicrobial resis - tance, and prompt detection of the organ - ism with appropriate treatment.3 N. gonorrhoeae is an ancient human patho - gen. Over hundreds of years, the organism has evolved to evade the human immune system. It is also able to cause repeated infections, is considered to have the ability to evolve further, and even develop resistance to all antibiotics.4 THE IP'S ROLE IN PREVENTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF FURTHER RESISTANCE What can IPs do to reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance and prevent further development of drug-resistant infections? Here are some recommendations:34 | FALL 2017 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTION Be vigilant about how your facility uses antibiotics. Actively participate in the antibiotic stew - ardship committee meetings and learn what your facility is doing to address anti - biotic resistance. Educate staff about the importance of always giving antibiotics on time and avoiding skipping a dose. Develop an interdisciplinary process to check patient's culture and sensitivity reports, and act as a patient advocate by informing the physician if the bac - teria are sensitive to a narrow-spectrum antibiotic (for example, work with the pharmacy, nursing, and/or the infectious disease physician). Educate and communicate the need to always observe Standard and Contact pre - cautions when caring for patients with antibiotic-resistant infections (per your facility's guidelines). Disseminate (celebrate!) information regarding unit-based surveillance out - comes to communicate trends in local resistant infections. Read evidence-based and best practice recommendations. LABORATORY TESTING A definitive diagnosis is important because signs and symptoms of gonorrhea are similar to those of infections caused by chlamydia. Why? Because the two infec - tions require different antibiotic treatment. Because of similar symptoms, both Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis , the bacteria that causes chlamydia, are tested at the same time. Repeat testing is recom - mended to ensure that treatment has been effective. This is done about three months after a person has completed treatment. 1,5 Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is the recommended method of testing for gonorrhea. NAAT is a molecular test that detects the genetic material (DNA) of N. gonorrhoeae . It is generally more sensitive and specific than other gonorrhea tests, and can be performed on a vaginal swab on women, or urine from both men and women, which eliminates the need for a pelvic exam in women.5 Besides NAAT, another test to detect gon - orrhea is a gonorrhea culture, which grows the bacteria. In men, a quick method is the Gram-stain, from a sample from the ure - thra, a microscopic analysis can detect the presence of the typical intracellular Gram- negative diplococci. While this method can diagnose gonorrhea, it is not sufficient to rule out an infection in asymptomatic men. This method is not reliable for samples from women since other bacteria normally found in the female genital tract will look the same under the microscope, necessitat - ing the need for culture results, which can take up to 48 hours. 5 PREVENTION GUIDELINES Enhanced monitoring and rapid, appro - priate therapy is needed. Factors contribut - ing to increasing antimicrobial resistance of gonococci include the high rate of anti - microbial therapy, as well as suboptimal monitoring for antimicrobial resistance. This has resulted in treatment failures for gonorrheal infections worldwide. The WHO recommends the development of methods for genetic testing to better understand the strains that are appearing in different regions of the world.2 Standard precautions are implemented for this sexually transmitted disease. However, some facilities may begin considering resistant gonorrhea a multi-drug resistant organism and, where prevalent, may institute additional precautions.6 Recently, a scientific research study has appeared in the literature from New Zealand indicating that a new vaccine may be developed to prevent gonorrhea.7 Irena Kenneley, PhD, RN, CNE, CIC, FAPIC, is a professor at Case Western Reserve University, Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing in Cleveland, Ohio.

This is the first of a group of articles in this series that will dig into the concept of frequency measures and the many beneficial roles they play in infection prevention. BY DANIEL BRONSON-LOWE, PHD, CIC, FAPIC AND CHRISTINA BRONSON-LOWE, MS, CCC-SLP, CLDFROM DATA TO DECISIONS Ratios, proportions, and rates AN INFECTION PREVENTIONIST (IP) tasked with examining knee replacement surgical site infection (SSI) data for her two facilities discovers that over the last quarter, 20 of the knee replacement surgeries at Facility A and 5 of the knee replacement surgeries at Facility B have resulted in infection. Assuming that the severities of the infections for the two facilities are similar, which facility has the bigger problem? At first glance it may appear that that the answer is Facility A; 20 is certainly larger than 5. Unfortunately, we can't provide a good answer to that question because we haven't been given enough information. All we have are the counts: the numbers of SSIs. If we want to accurately compare data from different groups we have to take into account the sizes of those groups. To do this we need to incorporate denominators . The numerator in this example is the number of SSIs identified. An appropriate denominator for SSIs is the number of surgeries performed. Let's apply that to our data and multiply the results by 100 to convert our answers into percentages: Facility A is the IP's hospital, and it has performed 1,000 knee replacement surgeries. When we divide 20 SSIs by 1,000 surgeries, we learn that 2% of their surgeries resulted in infection. Facility B is the IP's ambulatory surgery center (ASC), and it has performed 10 knee replacement surgeries. When we divide 5 SSIs by 10 surgeries, we learn that 50% of their surgeries resulted in infection.We now have a more complete picture of what is occurring at these two facilities and can make an informed decision about which facility has the bigger problem. This concept of applying a denominator to make data comparable is what makes ratios possible. This is important because ratios play a critical role in surveillance. A ratio is a comparison of any two values and follows this formula: The value 10n refers to 10 raised to the power n , such that: 100 = 1 (because anything raised to the power of 0 equals 1) 10 1 = 10 (because any value raised to the power of 1 is that same value) 10 2 = 10 x 10 = 100 103 = 10 x 10 x 10 = 1,000 ...and so on. Even though all ratios are based on the same formula, they can take many forms. For instance, all of these are ratios: Example A: (420 inpatient beds \u00f7 3 IPs) x 1 = 140 inpatient beds per IP Example B: (18 patients with infections \u00f7 50 patients) x 100 = 36% of patients had infections Example C: (120 cases \u00f7 80,000 admissions per year) x 10,000 = 15 cases per 10,000 admissions per yearExample A is a classic ratio comparing two unrelated val - ues: beds and IPs. Ratios are sometimes expressed using the phrase \"to 1\" such that \"140 inpatient beds per IP\" would be reported out as \"the ratio of inpatient beds to IP is 140 to 1.\"20 knee replacement SSIs 1,000 knee replacement surgeries x 100 = 2% 5 knee replacement SSIs 10 knee replacement surgeries x 100 = 50%numerator denominator x 10nFROM DATA TO DECISIONS www.apic.org | 37 IMAGE CREDIT: ANDREW KRASOVITCKII/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM38 | FALL 2017 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTIONFigure 1: Relationships between Ratios, Proportions, and Rates Figure 1: Relationships between ratios, proportions, and ratesBy increasing the size of the denominator using surgeries that have nothing to do with the knee SSIs in our numerator, we cause the infection rate to drop. This results in an inaccurate view of the knee replacement-related infection risk at this facility. You may have noticed that in this example we appear to be looking at something that is both a rate (because it has units of time), and a proportion (because the patients with knee SSIs are a subset of the patients having knee surgeries). As it turns out, while proportions and rates are each specific types of ratios, they are not mutually exclusive (See Figure 1). And now, a brief word about terminology. All of these con - cepts\u2014counts, ratios, proportions, and rates\u2014get lumped together under the term frequency measures . There are frequency mea - sures out there with names that don't line up with the standard definitions covered in this article. For example, attack rate and prevalence rate have the word \"rate\" in their names but lack time units. (They are actually proportions.) We have mentioned in previous articles that when it comes to statistics, not everyone sticks to the same terminology. This is more of that same issue. The important thing is to not worry too much about the specific name used and instead focus on understanding what is being measured and calculated so that you can ensure it makes sense for what you are trying to assess.Example B is a proportion because it is comparing the number of patients with infections to the total number of patients. (Examples A and C are not proportions because their numerators and denomi - nators don't meet this requirement.) While proportions can be expressed as a decimal, a fraction, or a percentage, they are most often presented as percentages because many people find those easier to understand. A rate is another specific kind of ratio. The extra component that defines a rate is that it includes a unit of time so that it provides information about how fast events are occurring. Example C is a rate because it includes the concept of \"per year.\" The unit of time used isn't limited to blocks of calendar-defined time like days, months, and years, however. In infection prevention we also see rates that make use of time units like patient-days and central line-days. The formula for calculating a rate is: Note the phrase \"at risk\" in the denominator of the formula. When you are calculating a rate, the denominator does not have to be related to the numerator as it does for a proportion but it should ideally only include the population at risk for the event seen in the numerator. Let's revisit the knee replacement SSI calculation for the ASC mentioned at the beginning of this article as an example, this time emphasizing the time element in the calculation: We limited the denominator to only knee replacement surger - ies because those were the only surgeries that could result in the knee-related SSIs being investigated. If we'd instead included all surgeries for the quarter in the denominator, regardless of what type of surgery was performed, we would end up with something like this:number of events or persons of interest total number of events or persons (of which the numerator is a subset) x 10 n number of events during the time period number of events, persons, etc. at risk during the time period x 10n 5 knee replacement SSIs (during the quarter) 10 knee replacement surgeries (during the quarter) x 100 = 50% (for the quarter) 5 knee replacement SSIs (during the quarter) 500 surgeries (during the quarter) x 100 = 1% (for the quarter)A proportion is a specific kind of ratio that compares a part to the whole. This is done by only comparing a numerator and denominator if the numerator is included in the denominator, like so:www.apic.org | 39 CONCEPT QUIZ FOR EACH OF the following scenarios, identify which pieces of information (A-D) you need for the numerator and denominator to answer the question being posed. Scenario 1 Determine what percent of employees were exposed to scabies last year. A. Number of employees exposed to scabies last year B. Number of employees with scabies last year C. Number of patients with scabies last yearD. Number of employees in the facility last year Scenario 2 Determine how likely it is that a C-section performed by Dr. Z will result in an SSI. A. Number of C-sections performed last year B. Number of C-sections performed by Dr. Z last month C. Number of C-sections performed by Dr. Z that resulted in an SSI last month D. Number of C-sections performed by Dr. Z that resulted in an SSI last yearScenario 3 Determine the proportion of patients with Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) who died from those infections. A. Number of patients who received antibiotics for any reason B. Number of patients with CDIC. Total number of patient deaths D. Number of patient deaths attributable to CDI AnswersLet's wrap up things up by covering some rules of thumb for choosing which frequency measure to use. A key element of this decision is to think about the question you want answered and the information you want to examine or relay. Counts: Use counts if you want to discuss how many times something occurred or to indicate an amount of resources, such as how many patients were harmed, how many exposures took place, or how many doses of vaccine are needed. Remember: counts are an important frequency measure in their own right. They just don't work well when you want to make comparisons across differing groups. Ratios: When it comes to ratios that are not also proportions and/or rates, they are useful for comparing two unrelated values, like environmental services employees versus patient rooms or predicted versus observed numbers of infections. Proportions: Use proportions when you want results that can be reported using percentages or the phrase \"out of,\" such as \"25% of patients developed infections\" or \"10 out of 250 employees received influenza vaccination.\" Rates: Use rates when the period of time involved or the speed at which something is occurring is important. If you are dealing with concepts like patient-days or the frequency of infections before and after an intervention then you should be using rates.

By studying and learning from outbreaks in the LTC/behavioral health setting, the infection preventionist (IP) will glean additional knowledge and apply this information to hopefully prevent future infections and infection clusters in their facility. This quarterly column will help the IP to heighten awareness of appropri - ate interventions for preventing an outbreak.BY STEVEN SCHWEON, RN, MPH, MSN, HEM, CIC, HAUGEN, RASCH, Haugen, and Tageson,1 describe a Norwegian nursing home setting with 140 beds, housing seven wards with 19-22 beds each. The facility has both short-term and long-term patients, in addition to a day care center. The facility has 22 single bedrooms with sinks but no private toilet facilities. Two male patients, an 85-year-old and an 89-year-old, are both being treated for pro - longed eczema; the 85-year-old's clinical course is being managed at a dermatology clinic. Eczema, also known as dermatitis, is a long-lasting skin disorder characterized by dry, itchy skin, with rashes on the face, inside the elbows, behind the knees, and on the hands and feet .2 Eczema is not conta - gious, and its cause may have genetic and environmental factors. However, there is suspicion that the lack of clinical improve - ment may be due to a non-eczema factor. The infection control nurse who's responsi - ble for this facility, also helps to support 44 other nursing homes, with 4,000 residents. As the IP, predicated upon your education and clinical prowess, you suspect:1. Hepatitis E 2. Head lice 3. Scabies 4. Legionnaires' disease Both patients stayed at the same nurs - ing home but had no contact with each other. Neither shared the same caretakers. To assist with elucidating the diagnosis, a skin scraping with a needle was performed over a burrow, which is a track into the skin caused by the burrowing scabies mite, and examined with a microscope. The burrow itself appears as raised, crooked lines on the skin surface. Scabies is confirmed upon visu - ally identifying this infestation agent. It was soon determined that one patient, while at home, was cared for by a home care assistant who was treated for scabies. The patients with scabies were isolated until eight hours after finishing the treat - ment. The employee's personal protective equipment (PPE) included gloves, long- sleeved gowns, and shoe covers. Furniture, mattresses, pillows, and personal items that could not be laundered were placed in a large rented freezer or in a plastic bag for 10 days, at room temperature. A total of 13 patients and 6 healthcare workers became infested; 16 cases had con - firmed mites detected through microscopy. The number of individuals itching was much higher. Two other nursing homes also experienced scabies infestations. Permethrin was the initial drug of choice, but due to treatment failures, benzyl ben - zoate was used. Staff who were treated for scabies were allowed back at work after treatment but had to wear gloves and perform \"special hand-washing\" for the first three days.Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis , also known as the human itch mite, is a member of the arthropod family. 3 Other types of the sca - bies mite infest mammals, including dogs, cats, and horses, but they cannot reproduce on humans. Scabies is known as the \"great imitator\" due to the disease mimicking other conditions such as impetigo, syphilis, and dermatological conditions. 4 Transmission occurs person-to-person by \"...direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with a person who has scabies.\" 5 In insti - tutions such as nursing homes, prisons, and extended-care facilities, where there may be crowded conditions, scabies can be transmitted and outbreaks can occur due to the close body and skin contact that occurs.6 Additionally, avoiding an infested person's clothing and bedding will also pre - vent transmission. Symptoms of scabies appear up to two months after the individual becomes infested, but transmission to others can still occur despite the lack of symptoms. Symptoms can appear 1-4 days after expo - sure if a second episode should occur. Severe itching, especially at night, is the most com - mon symptom. Itching and a rash are due to the skin reacting to the mite's proteins and feces. The rash and itching may appear between the fingers, wrist, elbow, axilla, penis, nipple, waist, buttock, and shoulder blades. The intense scratching may lead to a secondary Staphylococcus or Streptococcus skin infection. Upon falling off the body, PHOTO CREDIT: CDC/SUSAN LINDSLEYwww.apic.org | 41 rash or itching may be due to medication resistance, improper medication applica - tion, and re-exposure to infested items or individuals. The CDC recommends retreatment 1-2 weeks after initial treat - ment for symptomatic patients or if live mites are present. An outbreak in a nursing home can be curtailed only by treating the entire popu - lation at risk. All individuals who had prolonged skin-to-skin contact with the infested person should be recommended for treatment. Bedding, clothing, and towels should be laundered in hot washer and dryer settings, dry-cleaning, or sealing in a plastic bag for at least 72 hours. Fumigation is not indicated. Patients with suspected or confirmed scabies are placed on contact isolation pre - cautions until 24 hours after initiation of effective therapy.9 The CDC does not list scabies on the 2017 \"Nationally Notifiable Conditions\" list - ing.10 Per Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services regulations and facility policy, con - sider notifying the Department of Health of any positive cases and your efforts to curtail additional transmission.

Crusted scabies (Norwegian scabies) is a severe form of scabies that affects the elderly, immunocompromised, and indi - viduals who lack the ability to scratch themselves due to a medical condition, e.g., spinal cord injury. This type of scabies is highly transmissible. The scabies diagnosis can be made based on the rash and the presence of burrows. The skin scraping is also helpful for con - firming infestation, but an individual can still be infested, despite the lack of a positive skin scraping. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the follow - ing guidance for treating scabies7: Scabicide lotion, containing permethrin, is available by prescription only, and should be applied to clean skin. The application instructions should be carefully followed. Side effects include mild burning, sting - ing, redness, and itching. Ivermectin is an alternative oral agent. The CDC notes one study demonstrated increased mortality among the elderly who received this medication, but this has not been confirmed in follow-up stud - ies. Side effects include allergic reactions, dizziness, loss of appetite, and gastroin - testinal disorders.

Keeping the infested individual's fingernails trimmed will assist with limiting trans - mission and secondary skin infections. The resident may feel miserable with the severe skin itching and lack of initial therapeutic response to the medication. There is also a psychological impact of having a skin condition, and emotional support will be needed. Residents may feel stigmatized, as caretakers may be reluctant to perform care, despite wearing PPE, due to their own personal fears. 3. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This year, IIPW takes place October 15-21; the theme is Antibiotic Resistance . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that annually, at least two million illnesses and 23,000 deaths are caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the United States alone.1 The rise in antibiotic resistance is one of the top public health threats facing the world today. Thus, it is critical for IPs to help healthcare profession - als across the continuum preserve antibiotics for the future, and highlight the importance of infection prevention. APIC has resources and tools to help maximize your impact during IIPW and all year long. Everything you need is on the Infection Prevention and You website: www.apic.org/InfectionPreventionandYou .

CHG BATHING Barbara DeBaun, MSN, RN, CIC, improvement advisor for Cynosure Health, Point/Counterpoint: The use of CHG for patient bathing and the discontinuation of contact precautions for patients with Clostridium difficile To use or not to use Research is designed to provide a road map for infection preventionists (IPs) to follow when it comes to applying science to treat - ment. But, when it comes to some of the most provocative issues, research can be ably wielded to make just about any case. The following pages will look at the two point/counterpoint discussions during APIC's 44th Annual Conference and the experience of two IPs in a Middle Eastern country, all focused on proper patient care and infection prevention. and Russell Olmsted, MPH, CIC, FAPIC, director of infection prevention and con - trol at Trinity Health, took on the issue of whether all patients should be bathed with CHG. Before beginning, a poll gauged partici - pants' thoughts before and after the debate. Prior to the discussion, 70 percent felt it did not need to be conducted house-wide. Olmsted argued for the wider bathing, calling CHG \"the Swiss Army knife, a utili - tarian tool that does it all.\" He pointed to a number of studies which showed cleansing patients reduced surgical site infections. New CDC guidance advised patients to bathe with soap or antiseptic the night before surgery while the World Health Organization deemed it a \"good practice.\" Olmsted had a number of research studies to support his point, claiming \"eight of nine stud - ies between 2012 and 2016 showed that CHG does lower the prevalence of HAIs caused by [multidrug-resistant organisms] MDROs.\" He also cited three studies from 2016 and 2017 that showed improvements with MRSA rates when CHG bathing was implemented. DeBaun immediately found her points of agreement. \"Bathing is a good thing and the Swiss Army knives do it all.

Things that we do to the skin impact it dramatically.\" She's not willing to totally throw CHG out with the bath water, but suggests \"we need to think sensibly about how we apply something that we know is a chemical, that we know is drying, and that we know it does impact the top layer of the skin.\" She notes that many studies often include CHG, along with other things. \"It's becoming increasingly difficult to figure out whether one portion of the indi - cation is making the difference. It's hard to know if CHG alone is having the impact.\" She added that antibiotics aren't the only things that need to be stewarded. \"Why would we want to use something for everybody? We did that for antibiotics and we're in a world of mess now.\" After that discussion, the number of those saying that house-wide bathing was not appropriate jumped to 93 percent. DISCONTINUATION OF CONTACT PRECAUTIONS Is the end of diarrhea the right place to stop contact precautions for patients with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) ? David Banach, MD, assistant professor and hospital epide - miologist at the University of Connecticut Medical School, and Phil Polgreen, MD, MPH, associate professor of internal medi - cine and epidemiology, University of Iowa, tackled that topic. As with the previous discussion, attendees were polled; 54 percent said that was the logical spot to stop precautions. Banach then argued that contact precau - tions should be prolonged. \"There's been data accumulating over the last decade,\" he said, citing studies that The panelists onstage at the APIC 44th Annual Conference. showed C. diff continued to be an issue for days and weeks after diarrhea ceased. One study cited showed prolonged C. diff shedding for up to a month after complet - ing treatment. Another showed the issue of \"healthcare worker hands as potential vectors,\" he said. That study showed that 12 percent of the healthcare workers caring for patients with C. diff were contaminated after coming into contact with the patient. In the post-diarrhea period, the contamination increased to 20 percent. \"That really highlights that this group may be of high importance,\" Banach said. \"Why should we continue contact precau - tions even after diarrhea resolves? We know that shedding of C. diff can be prolonged. We know that by enhancing our infection control measures among these asymptomatic patients, we can reduce our rates of hospital- onset infections.\" Polgreen served as the counterpoint, starting initially with agreement. \"I do not want to dispute the fact that asymptomatic 48 | FALL 2017 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTION colonization exists and shedding occurs. But we really don't know what that means.\" He noted that the most likely time to study C. diff rates was when an outbreak occurred. \"Many, many things go on in an outbreak,\" he said. \"It's hard to extrapolate.\" He pointed to one study that \"changed the way I think.\" It found that almost half of the cases of C. diff were not related. \"If almost half the cases are unrelated, there's not as much person-to-person spread as we thought,\" Polgreen said. He also said that antibiotic use cannot be ruled out in contributing to C. diff rates. But he was willing to compromise on one point. \"There are cases where you could argue that maybe it's worth doing. Those cases would be when there's an outbreak.\" Banach noted that there are upcom - ing C. diff guidelines and a new docu - ment from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America on the duration of contact precautions, both of which may provide more insight into the issue in the coming months. After the point/counterpoint, the poll was taken again; 62 percent said that the end of diarrhea was the logical place to stop contact precautions.

It involves culture change, champions for patient safety, evidence and science to support it, implemen - tation, monitoring and feeding back data to continue the journey. The U.S. is not the only country to struggle with culture change and improvement around preventing HAIs; other countries do as well. We have had the pleasure of visiting many countries, lecturing on infection prevention efforts and challenges within the U.S. On two occasions, once in 2015 and again in 2016, we visited a Middle Eastern country thanks to the generosity of their Ministry of Health (MOH). The purpose of these BY KIM DELAHANTY, MBA/HCM, PHN, BSN, CIC, FAPIC, AND FRANK MYERS, MA, CIC, FAPIC This obviously limited infection preven - tion strategies such as daily CHG bathing, vascular access site preparation, and the use of a CHG-impregnated vascular access site sponge patch. We proceeded to give our lec - tures and when these process measures were brought up, there were lengthy discussions on the use, or nonuse, of CHG and how to implement its usage in this Middle Eastern country to improve patient safety. The science-based evidence recommen - dations supported the pros: better patient satisfaction and safety outcomes, reducing HAIs, and reduced healthcare costs. This outweighed the cons: perceived higher costs of care with minimal gain.visits were to teach a four-day course address - ing infection prevention and control (IPC) training, IPC program development, and CIC\u00ae preparation for novice, proficient, and advanced infection preventionists (IPs), microbiologists, infectious disease physi - cians, and hospital epidemiologists, as well as the educational department at the MOH. The MOH oversees all public healthcare establishments and makes decisions about their product selection. Upon arrival in 2015 at the MOH training center, we interviewed the participants in the course and found out that they did not have access to chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) at the public hospital acute care facilities. Improving patient safety outcomes in a foreign country: The authors with their students.Introducing and implementing the use of CHG for patient bathing50 | FALL 2017 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTION The newly received education and access to the science gave the IPC directors and physician chairs of the infection preven - tion programs/committee leverage to make a claim for this comparatively low cost intervention with high-yield value that is documented in the literature. They were able to make a strong argument for CHG usage in a concise, collective manner based off the information we gave them and their own self-guided research. It also helped that key MOH employees were present during the lectures. We felt that the individuals at the MOH were very dedicated to patient safety. But, with any country, you never quite know how quickly or slowly a bureaucracy will move even on a patient safety issue. If they hadn't been dedicated to their patients, change may not have been possible. Because the main push back against the use of CHG to prevent infections was costs, we provided the cost benefit analysis. This included using their data on the number of infections that occurred in the previous year and comparing it to published data on HAI costs. We then compared those figures to the cost of CHG. Once the MOH saw the cost avoidance business case, and the science and evidence to support better patient safety out - comes, they approved access, and the use of CHG in clinical and operating room settings in the public hospitals began by the time we returned in 2016. Unfortunately, because they do not do house-wide surveillance, a report of decrease in infections wasn't available.This is an excellent example of collabora - tion across borders to reach optimal results in infection prevention and improving the safety of patients in healthcare settings around the globe. We arrived there simply to teach, but during the course of our inter - action, we were able to provide information on the benefit of CHG. When lecturing abroad, you get so much back from the students! Not only do you gain an admiration for their knowledge and dedi - cation to confronting problems, several that would cause many IPs in the U.S. to throw up their hands in frustration, but also their novel cost-effective answers to challenges. You also get, as in this case, the feeling of reward in helping make the IPC job easier and patients safer.

One of her partners in the hos - pital's sterile processing facility came in to discuss an impending change, in which one of UCSF's ambulatory surgery centers was no longer going to do cystoscope and ureteroscope sterilization for UCSF's adult urology clinic. Instead, the process would move to the hospital's sterilization department. It was a fairly routine conversation, but as it progressed, red flags started flying. Alvino learned that in January 2015, when UCSF's new pediatric urology clinic opened, the person tasked with cleaning and sending the rigid cystoscopes and ureteroscopes to the ambulatory center for sterilization moved to the pediatric clinic, and a new person took over the cleaning of the scopes at the adult clinic. \"We discovered they hadn't been doing the mechanical brushing in the inner lumens for about six months,\" Alvino said. \"They had passed the competency test, but we realized the test was unclear and didn't cover all of the necessary reprocessing steps.\" UCSF's infection prevention team sprang into action. Not only was the medical center about to have visits from state and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services regulators, but \"we were lucky or unlucky enough to be a University of California hospital when the UCLA endoscope issue developed several years before,\" said Amy Nichols, RN, MBA, CIC, director, Hospital Epidemiology and Infection Control. Identifying the \"scope\" of the issue and how to fix it was imperative. The UCSF Medical Center is a large facility, with three campuses, two hospitals, and 23 ambulatory clinic sites which use endoscopes that require some level of reprocessing. It's also a quaternary referral organization, with patients from all over the world. The infection prevention team discovered that between January and June 2015, the urology clinic cystoscopes and ureteroscopes had been reprocessed more than 1,200 times, affecting 471 patients. Here's how the team dealt with the fallout and improved the reprocessing, high-level disinfecting (HLD), and sterilizing procedures for every endoscope used throughout the facility. IDENTIFYING AND SOLVING THE PROBLEM The infection prevention team began by working with their partners in sterile processing and endoscopy to identify the extent of the endoscope reprocessing problem. \"We were given almost carte blanche to pull in whomever to our more than 20 meetings about this,\" Nichols said, noting that there was support from the frontline personnel all the way up to the executive level. In fact, the C-suite later authorized hiring a full-time person in the ambulatory depart - ment to see that scopes are handled correctly between patients. \"Our senior leaders are very, very patient-safety oriented,\" Nichols said. The infection prevention team also reached out to the clinics that use endoscopes. \"We knew which clinics were reprocessing scopes, probes, and instruments, but we didn't have any deep knowledge on how they were used and handled throughout their lifetime,\" said Carolyn Caughell, RN, MSN, CIC, infection control practitioner. This was made more difficult because \"not everyone speaks the same infection control language,\" she said. \"'Clean' to a clinic is not necessarily 'clean' to infection control.\" The infection prevention team discovered the medical center's inpatient facilities use SPM (sterile processing microsystem) device tracking, but there was no tracking system in the ambulatory clin - ics. So, with the help of a programmer from the infection control department, they built an institution-wide endoscope database to track inventory and list the most current manufacturers' instructions for use. Using a web-based platform, they first determined all of the locations that used critical or semi-critical reprocessable devices, and BY VICKY UHLANDEndoscope case study: University of California, San Francisco Medical Center PHOTO CREDIT: BELOBOROD/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM Nothing should touch a clean scope.54 | FALL 2017 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTIONasked for a list of their current inventory. \"We were not only looking for how many scopes they had, but every serial number and identifier each piece had,\" Alvino said. Then they contacted manufactur - ers to get the most up-to-date instruc - tions for use. Now, scopes are listed in the database by serial number and other information, along with the instructions. They also mapped out a plan to work with ambulatory services to develop very detailed scope reprocessing competencies and procedures that anyone can follow. And they worked to centralize both inpatient and ambulatory scope repro - cessing. Prior to this, all reprocessing was done locally, within the clinics. \"They were doing upwards of 50 a day,\" Alvino said. \"Through our risk assessment, we found a lot of opportunities for improve - ment.\" That included implementing a new endoscope sterile reprocessing location for the clinics and otolaryngology surgery. They also revitalized and took control of the Sterilization Subcommittee of the Infection Control Committee, which had been suspended in February 2015. This subcommittee, which includes peo - ple from the academic side of the UCSF, discusses cutting-edge issues like how to reprocess devices made by 3-D printers. LESSONS LEARNED As with most infection prevention measures, the UCSF IPs realized that a safe and effective endoscope handling and reprocessing strategy needed to be a team effort. \"We've been around this issue for 20 years, but the learning we've all under - gone has been tremendous,\" Nichols said. \"We discovered that IPs need to have a very comprehensive understanding of where these risky instruments are used, how they're handled, and how they're stored\u2014and that's a lot of information to collect and manage.\" Vicky Uhland is a health writer based in Colorado. 881034_Medline.indd 1 15/08/17 11:45 pmREAD MORE ABOUT ENDOSCOPES IN THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL Longitudinal assessment of reprocessing effec - tiveness for colonoscopes and gastroscopes: Results of visual and microbial cultures.

PREVENTION IN ACTIONwww.apic.org | 55 BY KELLY ROMANO, MPH, CIC; ANGELA KOPENEC, MT(ASCP); AND DANIELLE ZIELINSKI, BSN, RNHand in hand\u2014 Educational isolation rounds INFECTION PREVENTIONISTS (IP s) often have a grand idea of what their day might look like and then inevitably get sidetracked with phone calls during the course of the day. Calls may involve a construction breach, a water supply issue affecting sterility or humidity, a transmis - sion-based precaution question, or any number of events that may happen at any given point during the day. Our hospital is a suburban, community- based facility with 171 beds, including a neo - natal intensive care unit, a critical care unit that services cardiothoracic surgical patients, and several off-site locations that fall under our umbrella. We have one full, and two part- time IPs. In our facility, our primary questions come as a result of transmission-based precau - tions. The questions often originate from staff about whether precautions are needed and why they are needed. Questions also come from patients, or family members, who are upset or confused about the precautions that are in place. When that occurs, we go to the patient's room to discuss and answer any fur - ther questions with them. Over the period of a few months, we found that we spent a large amount of time responding to these phone calls about patients on transmission-based precautions. These calls were coming in often enough that the interruptions caused a real impact on the IP's daily activities. We wanted to find a way to alleviate staff and patient concerns, empower them with knowl - edge, and decrease the amount of routine calls that held us up from other priorities during the work day. How do we accomplish that, and still get the much needed information and education out to the staff, patients, and visitors? What we ultimately decided would benefit our department and patients was to provide educational infection prevention and control (IPC) rounds on all our newly admitted isola - tion patients. The IPs make rounds daily at our hospital, however, we're checking whether patients are in the appropriate precautions, that staff are following those precautions, and that staff are washing their hands. We also perform environment of care rounds once per week on different units to ensure our compliance with other IPC related safety concerns. We weren't necessarily focusing on direct, one- on-one patient or staff education. We wanted our educational IPC rounds to be concentrated on making sure the patients understand why precautions are necessary, what transmission- based precautions mean, and why the staff, \"We wanted to find a way to alleviate staff and patient concerns, empower them with knowledge, and decrease the amount of routine calls that held us up from other priorities during the work day.\" IMAGE CREDIT: FILE404/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM56 | FALL 2017 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTIONAt times, the isolation list generated by the computer system is not accurate. The IP will find patients who are in precautions, based on room signage, who are not on the isola - tion precautions list. When this occurs, the IP reviews records to find out if the precau - tions are to be continued or removed. This is when most of the questions from front-line staff occur, presenting the opportunity for staff education. We were unable to locate any articles in the literature that cite in-depth IPC round - ing. As part of this quality improvement initiative, we found that educational round - ing decreased the volume of questions from staff and patients, and that staff appreciate the additional support. We also found that it takes our IPs approximately 30 minutes to complete the rounds rather than having multiple hours of interruptions throughout the work day. Mondays are the exception and take a little bit longer, as we have to make up for the absence of weekend rounds. This pro - cess has enabled our IPC staff to increase the amount of time spent on the floors provid - ing education and support. Rounding also creates an opportunity for dialogue between IPs, and patients and family that was not routinely happening before. In addition, we are ensuring that patients are receiving education from specialists who understand their disease processes, multi- drug resistant organisms, and can answer questions at the bedside directly. We are cur - rently monitoring our progress and hoping to see an increase in patient satisfaction on the units, as well as decreasing the stigma associated with isolation practices.

At the beginning of 2017, we imple - mented an educational IPC rounding program. It sounds like something we all would like to do; however, as mentioned above, we become bombarded with dis - tractions throughout the day. Our staff round on each patient in transmission- based precautions only one time per hos - pitalization. We began using our isolation precautions list, which is generated via our electronic medical record, and providing education to each of those patients one time per hospitalization. During our \"round\" we go to the bed - side, educate the patient and family on the type of precaution and why they have been implemented. We also discuss what the staff and their visitors will need to do to protect themselves, field any questions they may have, and provide them with an easy to read educational pamphlet, created by our front-line nursing staff. While we are educating the patients, we are also able to field any staff questions about the pre - cautions, and place a note in the patient's electronic medical record to detail what was discussed. See the checklist in Figure 1 to help with implementation. PREVENTION IN ACTIONwww.apic.org | 57 BY IRENA KENNELEY, PHD, RN, AND ELIZABETH ZIMMERMANN, DNP, MSN, RN, CHSEOpportunities to educate student nurses on the importance of PPE: An Ebola simulation exercise THE NURSE PLAYS a critical role in preventing and controlling infectious disease. From day one, nursing students learn about, and are expected to participate in, the infection pre - vention process. An important component in preparing for clinical nursing practice is an understanding of the infection process and prevention techniques. Patients expect hospitals and other healthcare facilities to be more than clean, and nurses are directly involved in providing biologically safe envi - ronments for our patients. That includes everything from hand-washing to sterilizing our surgical instruments. SIGNIFICANCE In 2013, the American Journal of Infection Control (AJIC) published survey results from a British study of student nurses.1 An astounding 100 percent of student nurses surveyed observed lapses in infection pre - vention and control (IPC) practices during their clinical placements. As anecdotal evi - dence, in my 15 years of teaching microbiol - ogy to student nurses, 100 percent of them have observed lapses in IPC practices during their clinical rotations. THE USE OF SIMULATION Over a 16-week period, students are expected to attend weekly 110-minute labora - tory sessions. During the spring 2017 micro - biology course, we decided to do a simulation of caring for a patient with Ebola. Fortunately for simulation purposes, we were able to pur - chase reasonably priced kits containing all of the components of personal protective equipment (PPE) needed to safely care for such a patient. The advantages of simula - tion include: (1) replicate reality, (2) increase understanding of the clinical problem, (3) \"Many nursing schools are beginning to substitute some clinical time with simulated clinical experiences. Nursing educators and regulators need research data to understand if simulated clinical experiences are comparable to traditional, hands-on clinical experiences.\" consolidate learning, and (4) develop task competence.2 The purposes of the Ebola PPE simulation were to educate the student nurses about PPE through effective education, train - ing, hands-on work in a simulation, and to enhance knowledge and confidence to care for patients with highly contagious diseases. The objectives of the Ebola simulation were to: 1. Identify how to safely don, adjust, use, and doff the specific PPE that the healthcare worker will use. 2. Demonstrate how to safely conduct rou - tine clinical care for an Ebola patient. 3. Describe the limitations of the PPE (e.g., duration of use, degree of protection). 4. Enumerate what to do for equipment fail - ure or detection of a breach in PPE. 5. Apply appropriate methods to maintain PPE and appropriately dispose of it after use. The student simulation was designed after the Nursing Infection Control Education (NICE) Network program, which seeks to empower nurses to understand the proper and improper use of PPE for their own safety and for patient safety. This network includes the American Nurses Association (ANA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and 20 nursing specialty organiza - tions who partnered together to provide real- time, tailored infection control training to nurses, and to improve IPC practices known to be effective in preventing transmission and exposure to viruses and diseases such as Ebola and Zika, among other emerging infectious diseases. 4 SIMULATION EXERCISE Clinical experiences in nursing education involve hands-on learning experiences where PHOTO CREDIT: IRENA KENNELEY, PHD, RN, CNE, CIC, FAPIC58 | FALL 2017 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTIONstudents directly care for patients in various healthcare settings. This simulated clinical experience involves the use of a manikin baby to practice skills, such as conducting patient assessments, performing nursing interventions, communicating with other healthcare team members, and making clini - cal decisions while in an environment where a mistake will not harm an actual patient. Simulation scenarios are followed with a debriefing session. Many nursing schools are beginning to substitute some clinical time with simulated clinical experiences. Nursing educators and regulators need research data to understand if simulated clinical experiences are comparable to traditional, hands-on clinical experiences. The intention of this simulation was to learn if there are differences in educational outcomes of a post-simulation questionnaire. This simu - lation evaluated clinical competency, nursing knowledge, and how well student learning needs were met after completing this Ebola PPE simulation environment. After taking the pre-simulation question - naire, the University of Nebraska videos for donning and doffing PPE were observed prior to the simulation. The students worked in groups of three, each of them assigned to a specific role. One was the trained observer or \"buddy\" who helped the second student to don and doff their PPE. The third student had a checklist of all of the steps to ensure that all protective practices are strictly followed. We created a \"dirty\" side of an anteroom as well as a \"clean\" side. The \"patient\" was an infant manikin and the student nurses' jobs were to appropriately don PPE, safely change the diaper of the \"Ebola baby,\" and then go through the process of doffing and proper disposal of contaminated PPE while observing the \"dirty\" and \"clean\" sides of the anteroom. RESULTS The process of debriefing is considered a very important aspect of simulation learning. While there are multiple methods of debrief - ing, the plus/delta method was chosen for the Ebola simulation. This technique sim - ply asks \"what constituted positive aspects of the simulation and what needed to be changed?\"3 Table 1 outlines the positive aspects and opportunities for improvement identified by the students. The students displayed an enthusiastic response to this simulation. The course evaluations for this microbiology laboratory were overwhelmingly positive. Because an Institutional Review Board application was not completed, the results of the question - naires are not publishable. However, this simulation served as a pilot study of sorts for faculty's personal use. An application into the IRB has been submitted and will be ready for the next group of sophomores. CONCLUSION Adherence to IPC practices among stu - dent nurses must begin early and should be reinforced throughout their education. Ultimately, with training and education, enhanced patient safety, along with clini - cian safety, will improve adherence to IPC practices known to be effective in preventing exposure to Ebola virus disease and other emerging infectious diseases.

One IP's journey to understand causes for colored urine HAVING RECENTLY UNDERGONE surgical resec - tion of a tumor in my leg, I can tell you that panic came over me when I woke up and saw the contents in my urinary catheter (UC) bag for the first time after surgery. My urine was dark green! The nurse and I were shocked. She said she would send out a urine sample to identify the cause. During that period of panic, we discussed the possibilities and somewhat convinced ourselves that the cause was the dye used by o perating room staff to mark the area for incision with an \"x.\" It was important to both of us that we find the cause of this most peculiar manifestation! It seemed unfathomable that the development of such a large amount of discolored urine was possible considering the small \"x\" on the area of the leg incision and the actual time that had elapsed for absorption of the dye into the skin. I did not find out why my urine was green during that hospital visit, but eight months later, after viewing a Medscape slideshow, I found that the most likely answer was propofol (i.e., Diprivan), which is a short-acting agent that is commonly administered to maintain anesthesia dur - ing surgery and for patient sedation during ventilation. The development of green urine is a highly uncommon and unusual finding that is associated with receiving high doses of propofol.1 POTENTIAL CAUSES Although we all react differently to almost everything, including physiologic and other healthcare treatment modalities, I became interested in finding out more about why this unusual reaction developed in my case. Propofol is primarily metabolized in the liver, and subsequently oxidized to a quinol (i.e., a white crystalline substance), conjugated into glucocouric acid (referred to as glucuro - conjugation), and excreted in the urine. It is the process of glucuroconjugation that can BY PATRICIA LAWRENCE, MS, RN, CIC result in a changed color of urine, perhaps due to mixing blue with the yellow color of normal urine, which results in green. There is also data suggesting that there may be other routes of clearance, and that less than 0.3 percent of the parent compound is excreted without breaking down, indicating that it is unchanged during the metabolic process.2 What I found in the literature is that what actually causes the green color is unclear, except that it is rare and it happened to me. That figures because did I mention that the form of sarcoma I have is also very rare? So I see myself as a rare person in more ways than one! But I digress... During my investigation of the causes, I read about another cause of developing green urine. Uribel, which is similar to phenazopyridine and is used to relieve uri - nary discomfort, contains methylene blue. When mixed with the yellow color of nor - mal urine, Uribel turns urine green. 1 And Pyridium, which is another phenazopyri - dine, turns urine orange or red. Pyridium contains a dark red or dark purple coloring that can turn urine orange when mixed with the normal yellow color of urine.3,4Although not as rare, I had another shock - ing experience with urine color about 15 years ago after having dinner with friends at a restaurant. After dinner I went to the rest room and when I came out I said to my friends, \"Don't panic but I may be bleed - ing.\" As they burst out laughing, I started to ponder my choice in friends, but between their laughter they reminded me that I had eaten a beet salad as part of my dinner. So I guess I had never eaten that many beets in one sitting because making it to 40 years of age and having never experienced a change in urinary color after eating beets was a sur - prise to me. Later that night, I was especially amused when I Googled \"beets and urine color,\" and found that the condition is identi - fied by the name of \"beeturia.\" Beeturia is the passage of red or pink urine after eating beetroots, or foods that are colored with beetroot extract or beetroot pigments. The color is a result of betacyanin pigments, such as betanin, and the color varies among individuals and different occa - sions.5,6 I was also surprised to find that only 10-14 percent of the population a re capable of developing beeturia.5 By now you can probably see why I con - sider my case and experiences with urine color to be unusual if not just odd! There are many reasons why one would excrete this color of urine, and if you're interested in more detailed information, perform an Internet search for beeturia. WHY A NURSE NEEDS TO KNOW The reason for writing this article is that I thought a review and update on what causes urine to change color would be helpful. Now that many healthcare institutions implement a nurse-driven protocol that provides guid - ance on medical reasons for use of a urinary catheter (UC), maintaining knowledge of various reasons for change in urine color is important. As a result, nurses have become PHOTO CREDIT: PONGSAK A/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM62 | FALL 2017 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTIONTABLE 1.

As educated partners in the healthcare delivery system, it is important for nurses to be able to identify when and why a patient's urine may not look normal because this can support the need to maintain or remove a UC. Many nurses and other healthcare cli - nicians never see cases of all the possible different colors of urine, and some may mis - takenly identify urine as red when it should be more accurately identified as tea-colored or amber. 1 What follows is a review of the various colors that urine can change to and the reasons for changes in urine color (See Table 1). First, let's agree that normal urine is clear to yellow in color. Cloudy urine that is yellow may signify infection. Urine that is amber or a darker yellow color can be a result of dehydration. Cloudy and amber or dark yel - low urine are no doubt the most commonly observed urine color changes that healthcare clinicians identify in routine patient care and treatment. Other changes in urine color such as red urine, or hematuria, are commonly identi - fied by nurses and other healthcare clinicians who treat patients in acute care. Hematuria has many causes, including glomerular conditions (i.e., affecting the kidney), non- glomerular conditions (i.e., affecting the ureter, bladder, or urethra), a malpositioned UC (e.g., as a result of inserting a UC in a male patient who has a significantly enlarged prostate), urinary tract infection (UTI), cys - titis, malignancy in the urinary system (e.g., urothelial cancer of the bladder, renal cell carcinoma), nephrolithiasis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (e.g., in the vascular primary gland itself or a result of vascular prostatic regrowth after transurethral resection of the prostate [TURP]).1 Although patients with some of these conditions will require a UC as part of treatment (e.g., after undergoing TURP), other patients may not require a UC (e.g., patients who are diagnosed with a UTI, cystitis, or a kidney stone).Other causes of red or pink urine are benign, including hematuria that develops as a result of receiving certain medications (e.g., rifampin, although urine may be red - dish-orange in color instead of red; laxa - tives containing senna) or food (e.g., beets, blackberries, rhubarb). 6 Orange urine can result from receiving certain medication (e.g., Pyridium, certain laxatives, certain chemotherapy drugs) and from medical conditions involving the liver or bile duct. Amber-colored urine can appear orange and is related to concentrated urine.1,6 Purple urine is rare and can develop when certain bacteria (e.g., Providencia stuartii , P. PHOTO convert indoxyl sulphate to indigo and indirubin.7 Purple urine is usually only observed in patients with a long-term indwelling UC, since the polyvinylchloride lining of the UC absorbs the pigment made from these organisms, if present. Patients who develop purple urine are identified as having \"purple urine bag syndrome\"(PUBS).1 Nurses and other healthcare clinicians who observe purple urine in a patient should be aware of the possibility of an underlying and recurrent UTI, the possibility of improper care of the UC, and the frequency of incidence of lack of appropriate hygiene that is associated with the color conversion to purple urine. Brown-colored urine can be a sign of biliru - binemia (i.e., increased bilirubin in the blood stream), which can indicate hepatocellular or cholestatic liver disease (e.g., hepatitis, cirrhosis, or choledocholithiasis).1 The conju - gated form of bilirubin is found in the urine. Myoglobinuria (i.e., urine containing protein found in muscle tissue), which is usually a result of rhabdomyolysis (i.e., abnormal breakdown of muscle tissue), is another con - dition that can cause brown urine.1 Brown urine can be difficult to discern from red urine in some cases. Centrifuging the urine can usually differentiate myoblobuniuria from hemaglobinuria because the devel - opment of a clear center after centrifuge is indicative of myoglobinuria rather than hemaglobinuia, which results in reddish sediment in the center. Also, creatine kinase is elevated in myoglobinuria. Brown urine can also result from eating large amounts of fava beans or aloe. Certain medications can cause brown urine, includ - ing the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and primaquine, the metronidazole cascara or and methocarba - mol, which is a muscle relaxant. Extreme exercise that causes muscle injury can result in pink or cola-colored urine.6 Black urine can be caused from the highly toxic ingredient paraphenylenediamine, which is found in certain hair dye formula - tions. Paraphenylenediamine directly affects renal tubular cells and causes hypovolemia, hemolysis, and rhadomyolysis. The result is acute-kidney injury that causes black urine, and some patients require treatment with dialysis. 1 Other hemolytic conditions that can cause black urine include infection with Plasmodium falciparum (i.e., the para - site that infects red blood cells and causes malaria) with concurrent use of amino-alco - hol drugs (e.g., quinine, mefloquin), which were commonly prescribed to treat malaria. This condition is commonly referred to as blackwater fever (BWF). Although there are other causes of BWF (e.g., glucose-6-phos - phate dehydrogenase [G6PD) deficiency), it is commonly referred to as a malaria infec - tion with high parasitemia found in red blood cells. The massive amount of hemo - globin released from the infected red blood cell floats freely in the blood and is excreted in the urine, resulting in black or very dark red urine. 8 The use of propofol in development of green urine is detailed previously, and there are other reasons for urine to turn blue or green. Ingesting brightly colored food dyes, administration of dyes for diagnostic func - tion tests of the kidney and bladder, receiving the medication amitriptyline, and receiv - ing the medication Indocin can cause the development of green or blue urine.6 Benign hypercalcemia, which is a rare disorder that is also called \"blue diaper syndrome\" when observed in children, can cause blue urine. Green urine may develop in patients who are infected with Pseudomonas .6 The next time you evaluate a patient's urine in a UC bag, or another container, and identify a color that is not normally seen, remember the rare cases of abnormal urine color after receiving high doses of propofol, and the shock I experienced with excreting dark green urine for a day and not knowing why! Special thanks to my dear friend Darlene Strayer in Montana, who was the initial person to read about my strange occurrences, yet ended up discussing all sorts of colors!

PHOTO CREDIT: TYLER OLSON/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM64 | FALL 2017 | Prevention FEATURE BY LESLIE KRETZU, MA, MIPPLAUNCH OF THE APIC\u00ae PROGRAM OF DISTINCTION Developed by a team of subject matter experts, the intent behind the new effort is to assist facilities in maintaining an increased level of readiness with standards developed for infection preven - tion teams by infection preventionists (IPs) with 30-40+ years of experience in the field. Having an established set of criteria that defines the necessary components for an IPC program to achieve excellence offers a road map for facilities of all sizes. A contingent of APIC board members, other leaders, and APIC staff recognized that APIC was the organization to make this happen, and that the time was now. BACKGROUND In April 2014, the staff of APIC Consulting approached several leaders of APIC with a new concept: an APIC \"stamp of approval\" for IPC programs of excellence that meet certain criteria points. A voluntary program for interested facilities, the Program of Distinction would recognize leading facilities with this designa - tion and offer them targeted communications highlighting the success of the facility's IPC program. Terrie Lee, RN, MS, MPH, CIC, FAPIC, former president of APIC (1995) and the Certification Board of Infection Control and Epidemiology (CBIC) (2011), and current president of the International Federation of Infection Control (IFIC) (2015-pres - ent), agreed to lead the overall project. \"We work in a field where we are aware of the need to strive for excellence and continu - ously demonstrate improvements in outcomes and processes,\" she said. \"In our own individual efforts for accreditation and other types of surveys conducted in our facilities, infection control has always been a component, but rarely envelops the entire breadth of what an IPC program brings to the table. This looked like an opportunity to help develop that comprehensive look at those programs in healthcare facilities\u2014one that was developed by IPs.\" With 37 years of experience in infection prevention, Terrie assisted in assembling a team of fellow subject matter experts to develop the program. (See Team list) Over the course of three years, the team - in conjunction with APIC Consulting staff - developed the framework, processes, and standards for the new program. At intermittent points during those years, staff presented plans and data to the APIC Board of Directors. In September 2016, the APIC Board voted unanimously to move ahead with the Program of Distinction. t the 2017 APIC Annual Conference in Portland, Oregon, attendees at the opening plenary session learned about a new program, which has been in the making for several years. During her opening remarks, APIC CEO Katrina Crist discussed the new APIC \u00ae Program of Distinction and detailed how it was designed to benefit APIC members and, more broadly, the field of infection prevention and control (IPC). The Program of Distinction is a recognition program that awards a designation of excellence to acute care facilities for IPC programs that meet a set of high-level standards, developed by leaders of APIC. With this endeavor, APIC seeks to increase the inherent value of the IPC department with the C-suite, with the public, and within the larger healthcare arena. HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS Similar to the Magnet Recognition Program \u00ae and the Beacon Award for Excellence, the APIC Program of Distinction is posi - tioned to be the highest-level recognition for IPC programs, granted by the leading association for IPs in the country. The website, www.programofdistinction.org, features a self-assess - ment exercise as the starting point for interested facilities. Eligible facilities are general acute care facilities, including specialty facilities. Prior to completing the self-assessment, facilities should ensure that they meet the following eligibility requirements: In operation for at least five (5) years. In compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations that apply to acute care facilities. Licensed by their state and CMS-certified. Note: It is desirable to be accredited by bodies such as The Joint Commission, DNV GL, or other providers of deemed status. At least one (1) IP on staff who is board certified in infection control. An IPC department in which all IPs with five (5) or more years of experience are board certified in infection control. If a facility finds that it meets the eligibility requirements and identifies no major gaps via the self-assessment exercise, the facility team is encouraged to submit an application, available on the website. Completed applications include a written application form and a series of uploaded documents, primarily policies and procedures. If the application successfully meets the necessary criteria and reaches a score within the set threshold, the facility is invited to the next step: an onsite assessment with two or more appraisers. If the facil - ity scores within the acceptable range for the assessment, it will be granted the recognition credential, which will be current for a period of three years. If the facility does not pass the onsite evaluation, the team of appraisers will provide a list of identified deficiencies, a de facto action plan for the facility's IPC pro - gram to increase their ability to meet the program standards. All information col - lected is kept confidential between the facility point-of-contact and the facility's specific Program of Distinction team of appraisers. Michelle Farber, RN, CIC, past presi - dent of the APIC Board of Directors (2012), is pleased how the process includes various levels of review by dif - ferent teams of CIC\u00ae-certified appraisers. As an author of the APIC Competency Model and a contributor to the 2020 Strategic Plan, Michelle noted the inde - pendence of the Final Determination Team within the process as a critical step in ensuring inter-rater reliability. \"The third and final component involves an evaluation of the reports from the first two components (i.e., application and onsite assessment),\" she said. \"The final evaluation is conducted by a team of IPs who were not involved in any of the previous compo - nents, to control for bias, and to assure fairness and integrity of the Program of Distinction process.\" Facilities that earn the designation gain the ability to use the Program of Distinction logo in their marketing and communi - cations outreach. A hard copy award will be provided for the facility's recognition wall. In addition, APIC will recognize the facility's name in its own marketing to its 15,000 members via www.apic.org | 65 The APIC\u00ae Program of Distinction stan - dards focus on the following 9 compo - nents of an infection prevention and control program: Surveillance Hand hygiene Unusual occurrence and outbreak investigation Isolation practices Safe patient equipment Safe patient environment Emergency management Employee health Antibiotic stewardship PHOTO CREDIT: @ISTOCK.COM/PABLO_K66 | FALL 2017 | Prevention journals, the Compendium of Strategies to Prevent Healthcare- Associated Infections in Acute Care Hospitals, and more, the team developed the standards over several years. In addition to their research and review of the evidence, the content experts bring their vast knowledge of surveys and assessments over several decades of experience. Reviewing the evidence in each essential element to create standards of excellence, they reached consensus on the criteria, an important aspect of the standard development content expert review process. As a result, the final standards/essential elements are the requirements for demonstrating excellence in infection control practice. Jan Frain, RN, CIC, CPHRM, past president of the APIC Board of Directors (2008) noted that the standard selection process was rigorous and detailed. \"Each standard underwent meticulous review by the Development Team before being finalized. Based on our review at the pilot facilities, we are confident that the Program of Distinction process provides a valid analysis of the scope and services of a facility's infection prevention and control program.\" Last August, APIC Consulting piloted the Program of Distinction with two facilities. One achieved the recognition and will be announced in an upcoming Prevention Strategist issue. The other facility did not; however, their infection prevention team did receive a list of recommendations that could be used as an action plan to increase the overall level of effectiveness of the IPC program. APPLICATION PROCESS The APIC Program of Distinction is accepting applications begin - ning in the fall of 2017, and applications will be available on the website www.programofdistinction. org. There is no application submission deadline, as applications are accepted on a rolling basis. All organizations are urged to review the eligi - bility requirements and self-assessment checklist to see how their programs match up to the APIC standards. Facilities that meet the requirements are encouraged to apply. The response to date from the infection prevention community has been overwhelm - ing. Countless leaders of APIC have expressed enthusiasm about the program, and facilities have begun requesting applications. As one quality director acknowledged, \"Of course I want this recognition. We're competing with several other hospitals in our area and this would give us a huge edge. It would differen - tiate us from the competition.\" For more information about the APIC\u00ae Program of Distinction, contact Leslie Kretzu at lkretzu@ apic.org. Leslie Kretzu, MA, MIPP, is the executive director of APIC Consulting Services, LLC. She has worked with APIC since 2008, and became the executive director of APIC Consulting in 2012. the APIC website, eNewsletter, Prevention Strategist magazine, and APIC Annual Conference, as well as to government and accreditation organizations, such as The Joint Commission and DNV GL. Connie Steed, MSN, RN, CIC, FAPIC, was an APIC board member for six years, two of which were spent as secretary. As the director of infection prevention for the Greenville Health System, she spoke about one of the most compelling parts of the Program of Distinction for her. \"The Program of Distinction recognizes acute care hospitals that have excellent infection prevention and control programs, which is vital to patient safety and quality. Applying for, and receiving, this recognition is a means to communicate to consumers of healthcare that excellent infection prevention standards of care are provided at the organization.\" DEFINING ASPECT OF THE PROGRAM: STANDARDS Terrie Lee believes that one of the defining elements of the APIC Program of Distinction is the way the onsite assessment is structured to evaluate the effectiveness of the IPC program throughout the entire facility. \"It isn't enough to have a great infection prevention depart - ment,\" she said. \"It's the entire hospital's engagement in the process that matters. It's organization-wide excellence that is required.\" The standards upon which the Program of Distinction is based, were developed and vetted by leading IPs in the field, largely former APIC officers and past presidents.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a fre - quent complication of surgical care and are associated with significant morbidity, mor - tality and cost. There are approximately 80 million surgeries in the U.S. each year, and roughly one and a half million of these will be complicated by an SSI, a number which is believed to be greatly underestimated due to challenges in post-discharge case finding and reporting.1 In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) healthcare-associated infec - tion (HAI) prevalence survey found that there were an estimated 157,500 SSIs occur - ring following inpatient surgeries.2 In this study, SSIs were the most common of all HAIs comprising roughly 30 percent.2 The mortality associated with SSIs is substan - tial, with an estimated mortality rate of 3 percent.3 Further, it is estimated that 75 percent of SSI-associated deaths are directly attributable to the infection.3 SSIs are also extremely costly to the health system with the average cost per infection ranging from approximately $5,000-$13,000. 4 In the last decade, national efforts to reduce SSIs have been expanded. The lat - est 2016 HAI Progress Report from the CDC reports that U.S. hospitals noted an 2017 HICPAC-CDC GUIDELINE FOR PREVENTION OF SURGICAL SITE INFECTION: BY MICHAEL ANNE PREAS, RN, BSN, MPH; AND KERRI THOM, MD, MSWHAT THE IP NEEDS TO KNOW overall decrease in SSIs in 2014 compared to the national baseline set in 2008 among the 10 select procedures tracked in previ - ous reports.5 In spite of an increasing focus on SSI reduction efforts and overall lower infection rates, the stakes remain high for all patients having surgery. Approximately 55 percent of SSI cases may be preventable with appropriate implementation of evidence- based strategies.4 HOW WERE THE GUIDELINES DEVELOPED? The CDC recently published an update to their guidelines for prevention of SSIs in JAMA Surgery.6 The new guidelines update SSI prevention recommendations with new evidence since the prior publica - tion.7 It should be noted that the updated guidelines are not comprehensive and that prevention strategies from the prior guidelines still apply. The 1999 guidelines were mostly informed by expert opinion, while the updated 2017 guidelines are evidence-based and were developed based on a systematic review of over 5,000 stud - ies published between 1998 and 2014. To fully evaluate and interpret the new recom - mendations, it is critical to understand the evidence rating system used by the CDC's Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC). The committee utilized the GRADE Approach (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation), which is composed of the categories below.8 Category 1A : Strong recommendation sup - ported by high to moderate-quality evidence suggesting net clinical benefits or harms. Category 1B : Strong recommendation sup - ported by low-quality evidence suggesting net clinical benefits or harms or an accepted practice (e.g., aseptic technique) supported by low to very low-quality evidence. Category 1C : Strong recommendation required by state or federal regulation. Category II : Weak recommendation sup - ported by any quality evidence suggesting a trade-off between clinical benefits and harms. No recommendation/unresolved issue : An issue for which there is low to very low- quality evidence with uncertain trade-offs between the benefits and harms or no pub - lished evidence on outcomes deemed criti - cal to weighing the risks and benefits of a given intervention.FEATURE ChloraPrep patient preoperative skin preparation can help reduce microorganisms on the skin that may cause infection.

The guidelines cover 14 main domains, including a new section on prosthetic joint arthroplasty. An overview of new or changed recommendations and their corresponding levels of evidence is provided in Tables 1 and 2. Some of the key recommendations include the following: Preoperative Prevention Practices For caesarean sections, administer the appropriate antimicrobial agent prior to skin incision (versus at cord clamping). Intraoperative Prevention Practices Administer increased fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) for intubated patients undergoing general anesthesia with nor - mal pulmonary function. This is a new recommendation and is specific to this patient population. This does not apply to patients without endotracheal intubation or those with neuraxial anesthesia. Perform intraoperative skin preparation with an antiseptic agent containing alco - hol unless contraindicated. Perioperative Management Strategies Implement glycemic control (blood glu - cose levels 200mg/dL) for both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. This updated recommendation now includes both dia - betic and non-diabetic patients and pro - vides a specific blood glucose target level. Maintain normothermia. Other guide - lines recommend a minimum temperature of 95.9\u00b0F (35.5\u00b0C).9 While attaining nor - mothermia is a strong recommendation, there is no recommendation for the most effective strategies to reach this goal. Discontinue antimicrobial prophylaxis after the incision is closed in clean and clean-contaminated procedures. This also applies to patients undergoing prosthetic joint arthroplasty, even in the presence of a drain. This recommendation updates the 1999 guideline recommendation that allowed administration of antibiotics for up to 24 hours post-incision. It should also be noted that 25 of the 42 statements assessed were classified as \"No recommendation/unresolved issue,\" suggest - ing that more high quality research in this area is necessary. No recommendation/unre - solved issue does not necessarily mean that a recommendation from the prior guideline has no merit or should be discontinued.

SUMMARY OF UPDATED, KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION GUIDELINE FOR THE PREVENTION OF SURGICAL SITE INFECTION, 2017www.apic.org | 71 WHAT CAN YOU DO AS AN INFECTION PREVENTIONIST TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES AND PREVENT SSI? The infection preventionist (IP) has an important role in SSI prevention beyond SSI surveillance. First, the IP must have knowledge and understanding of the new CDC guidelines, along with other existing and future prevention guidelines, which help guide best practices. The IP must continue to stay up-to-date with new guidelines, including state-issued guide - lines, as they are available.10 It is impor - tant to also anticipate potential barriers and facilitators to implementation of new recommendations. Furthermore, the IP should be familiar with the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) standards and guidelines, as they serve as the backbone for perioperative prac - tices.11 IPs can and should evaluate practice within perioperative departments, assess - ing for both strengths in practice and gaps in infection prevention. Second, the IP should identify and make plans to collaborate with key stakeholders and partners in SSI prevention to ensure that their facility's policies, procedures, and practices are aligned with new rec - ommendations in the updated guidelines. Hospital and surgical leadership should play an integral role in setting goals for prevention. Key stakeholders may vary by institution and, at a minimum, should include surgical service team members such as perioperative and central sterile processing staff, anesthesiologists, and sur - geons. However, other stakeholders may be important in the implementation of best practices and should be included in prevention efforts (e.g., infectious disease, microbiology, endocrinology, pharmacy, information technology, environmental services, etc.). Collaborations with key stakeholders require regular and open communication, and are essential to mak - ing practice improvements, reducing SSI, and preventing patient harm. The IP, along with perioperative and sur - gical colleagues, should be a leader in pre - vention efforts. The leadership team, along with other stakeholders, should focus on identifying gaps in practice and potential for improvement. Among these, institutional priorities should be determined, followed by a full analysis of current practice includ - ing possible facilitators and barriers to best practice. Stakeholder teams should also set goals and benchmarks, as well as a timeline for reaching those goals. IPs can assist with the assessment and implementation of new prevention strategies aimed at closing identi - fied gaps. Furthermore, the IP can aide in the development and collection of process measures unique to their own institutional goals to ensure adequate improvement in pro - cesses. It is important that the IP continue to collect SSI outcome data to provide feedback to teams working on improvement strategies. Finally, the IP should be a well-informed and integral part of the surgical team. This requires knowledge and understanding of practice at their facility. Consider incorporat - ing the following into your regular practice: Round regularly in the operating room. Observation provides an excellent oppor - tunity for assessing staff adherence to best practice. Plan what you want to accomplish before you start; round with a purpose and define your goals in advance. Will you be looking at hand hygiene compliance or observing Strategy Strength of Evidence Antimicrobial prophylaxis after surgical closure (clean and clean-contaminated procedures)Category IA Topical antimicrobial agents applied to the surgical incision Category IB Autologous, platelet-rich plasma Category II Antimicrobial sealant following intraoperative skin preparation Category II Plastic adhesive drapes for antisepsis Category II Withholding transfusion of necessary blood products (question posed for patients undergoing prosthetic joint arthroplasty) Category IBTABLE 2. STRATEGIES DETERMINED TO BE UNNECESSARY IN THE PREVENTION OF SURGICAL SITE INFECTIONS skin preparation? Is skin preparation being applied according to the manufacturer's recommendations? Is there compliance with surgical attire? Provide regular and constructive feedback on your observations. Share this infor - mation with perioperative and surgical leaders and encourage them to join you in any future rounds. Use rounds as an opportunity to collabo - rate and educate. Reinforce best practices, whether these are the updated recommen - dations or those that have not changed. Where there are those who do not feel that the evidence is sufficient or where there are \"nonbelievers,\" arrange smaller meetings to review the evidence and attempt to find common ground. Be aware of guidelines from other societ - ies (e.g., surgical specialty guidelines) and how they may support or be different from infection prevention guidelines. Antimicrobial surgical prophylaxis will be used as an illustrative example. The cur - rent CDC guideline states that antimicrobial prophylaxis should not be continued after the incision is closed for clean and clean- contaminated procedures. This recom - mendation represents a deviation from past guidelines, which allowed continuation of surgical prophylaxis for up to 24 hours after the incision, and thus will be a change in practice. An important potential barrier to this change is that other surgical guidelines still allow for prolonged prophylaxis after the incision is closed. For example, the recom - mendation from the Society for Thoracic Surgeons allows for up to 48 hours of anti - microbial prophylaxis post-cardiothoracic procedures.12 To ensure implementation of 72 | FALL 2017 | Prevention best practices, the appropriate stakeholders need to be included in discussions. In this case, consider surgical leadership (including representation from cardiothoracic surgery), infectious diseases, antimicrobial steward - ship, anesthesiology, pharmacy, nursing, and information technology. If stakehold - ers determine this to be an institutional priority, consider possible facilitators and barriers to achieving best practice. Although specific goals will vary by facility, one goal may be to achieve 90 percent compliance with discontinuing antimicrobial prophy - laxis after incision or documenting the need to continue in the patient's chart. Possible strategies may include education, protocol development, or creation of clinical pathways and order sets to facilitate compliance. References 1.

When left behind on the patient, linens, or floor, hair clippings can contaminate the surgical environment. Many OR nurses agree that the current cleanup practice of using adhesive tape is time-consuming, 3 and the reuse of tape rolls represents a cross-contamination risk.4-6 Recently published data demonstrated that BD surgical clippers fitted with the exclusive ClipVac vacuum-assisted hair-collection device eliminates these issues. 3 In this study, ClipVac was compared with standard surgical clippers (SSC) and adhesive tape cleanup. 3 Significantly less total clipping and cleanup time with ClipVac3Significantly less microbial contamination from hair left behind with ClipVac 3 Use of ClipVac resulted in a significant ( P < .001) reduction in both residual hair and microbial contamination within the operative field compared with SSC. The microbial burden recovered from residual hair during cleanup in the SSC group was 3.9 log 10 CFU and 4.6 log10 CFU from the chest and groin areas, respectively.3 ClipVac, a small, portable vacuum with a single-use nozzle and filtered reservoir that attaches exclusively to the BD surgical clippers, uses innovative technology to create a complete hair-removal system. The filter captures an average of 99% of hair and airborne contaminants generated in the clipping process, down to 0.3 m,* and is disposed of after each use. This technology saves valuable time by eliminating the entire secondary step of cleanup and the need for adhesive-based cleanup products that can be bacteria-laden, damage skin layers, and potentially cause adverse reactions.
