He earned his medical degree from the University of Missouri-Kansas City and did his residency training in Family Medicine at Deaconess Hospital in St. Louis Missouri. Dr. Soerries served as the National Medical Director for the Walgreens Healthcare Clinics where he supervised the care of hundreds of thousands of patients across the country. On a Personal Note... From a young age, Dr. Soerries knew that he was meant to become a doctor. In the summer between his junior and senior year of high school, he worked with the local family physician in his small hometown, and that experience solidified his decision to go into medicine. After years of working with a wide-variety of patients, Dr. Soerries' approach strongly emphasizes helping patients achieve a healthy lifestyle that they can stick with long-term. To do that, he treats them like a partner in developing and implementing changes in their day-to-day. This approach has allowed him to help countless patients that suffered from diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, among other chronic conditions. Dr. Soerries is a firm believer that patients should be active participants in their care. This means giving them all the information they need, and helping them make an informed decision, instead of trying to make decisions for them.
