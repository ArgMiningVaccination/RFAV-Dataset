I have read a lot about the benefits of CBD oil to control them however at present to the best of my knowledge it is still illegal here. Is there something else l can try? She has had a detox, is mainly on raw food and takes an herbal supplement for her heart. Thank you Lillian Dr. Deva Khalsa: Try Nux vomica 30x three times a day for one month in addition to chlorophyll powder in her food every day. Dear Dr Khalsa, I have a 5-year-old male cat. About 2 months ago he developed a cherry eye on his left eye. Initially it was small, but it progressed such that it covered the whole eye. We took him to the vet and they injected him with painkillers and amoxicillin. In addition eye drops were prescribed (olopatadine hydrochloride and Probeta N) along with an oral tablet (I don't remember its name) for 4 days. The medicine reduced the swelling but it's not completely gone. After months it's still the same size and I don't see any reduction of the swelling. For the last 5 days I have been washing the affected area with Euphrasia 30C solution (1 pellet in \u00bc cup of water) twice a day, but I does not seem to help. The right eye is perfectly healthy. My cat is unvaccinated and eats lots of mice. Can you suggest anything? Kind Regards, Isum N. Dr. Deva Khalsa: Try Staphasagria 6c three times a day for one month and stop earlier if it goes away and is no longer there. Hi Dr Khalsa, I have a pet dog named Pluto age 1year, who is very aggressive towards people. He keeps barking at people and even bites if he gets a chance. We are already training him with the help of a professional dog trainer but we are unable to handle his behaviour. His behavior is very unpredictable. At times he is very calm and behaves as if he is the sweetest boy, but the moment somebody enters our house be becomes aggressive. Thank you Shalini Rao Dr. Deva Khalsa: Hi Shalini, He does not understand, perhaps, where he sits on the rungs of power, shall we say. He may believe that he is top dog and that he runs the house and that he also, as top dog, has to protect it. I would read \" [Bones Would Rain from the Sky: Deepening Our Relationships with Dogs](https://www.amazon.com/Bones-Would-Rain-Sky-Relationships/dp/044669634X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=27OYMHEPGHN39&keywords=bones+would+rain+from+the+sky+by+suzanne+clothier&qid=1665447051&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjM1IiwicXNhIjoiMS4yMyIsInFzcCI6IjEuNDEifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=If+Bones+Would+Rain+from+the+Sky+%2Caps%2C399&sr=8-1)\" by Suzanne Clothier . This book will help you understand how dogs think. It's actually a nice read. And then you will know the steps to take so that he looks to you for guidance. Training and him learning that you guys call the shots seems more important in this situation than a remedy. This would come first. At some time, you may need to use the Chinese Herb Shen Calmer for a few months to mellow him out. It is not a drug, it calms the Shen which means the spirit.

Also, my cat is 6 and is due for a rabies shot. I don't want to give it to her. She is an indoor/outdoor. She has had two vaccines in her life. Suggestions? Thank you! Lisa Young Dr. Deva Khalsa: Hi Lisa, The Rabies vaccine is a viral vaccine, and with this, one vaccine is, for most pets, good for life. Stopping these vaccines is not very hard, depending on the township and if your cat is registered. I don't believe in vaccines for pets at all. At the same time, medical practitioners worry pet owners - and while I can treat parvo disease easily most can't. It's a fact that one parvo vaccine and one distemper vaccine after 18 weeks of age is good for life. This is from research by the best veterinary immunologist at a veterinary school- Dr. Ronald Schultz. I certainly consider their size but most veterinarians do not. Hello Dr. Khalsa, My cat has very irritated raw skin. Scratching till it bleeds on left side causing a swollen eye which is half closed. He also has raw skin below his chin on his neck and licks it constantly if not wearing a surgical collar and also itchy and wanting to scratch it constantly. Very sweet and clingy (which is unusual). Enjoys massage. Wants to sit beside someone including the dogs which is unusual too. Usually very independent. Eating and drinking as normal. I've given Arnica for skin trauma and also Hepar Sulph for swelling at eye in case it's an abscess. This has been going on for one month. No changes to diet, no collar, nothing different. Photos below: Thank you Liz (and William the cat age 2) Dr. Deva Khalsa: Mange, ear mites and allergies can all cause something that looks like this. You can use the injectable (BUT YOU GIVE IT ORALLY) IVERMECTIN 1% for horses, cows and sheep and give the cat one drop in food (from the needle of the syringe which is a small drop) twice a week for two weeks or so. This will clear up mange and also ear mites. Check if there is any crusty 'stuff' in the ear also which is often ear mites. If this does not work you can give Calendula 30x orally three times a day for one week and if she is still itching a lot add in Mezerium 6x twice a day. Hi Dr. Khalsa, My kitten got a shot of antibiotics a few weeks back and this hard spot showed up at the injection site. It's clearly painful to her. It looks like the hair is coming off at that spot. Is there anything I can try? Thank you Brenda Dr. Deva Khalsa: A few doses of Ledum and Hypericum in any potency. Give them three times a day for three days. Also, Calendula ointment on the area topically twice a day. Dear Dr. Khalsa, We just adopted a kitten that is constantly congested. Vet is saying that it's most likely kitten herpes. Is there a remedy or anything you can recommend to help ease the amount of mucus she has? It sounds like she is so uncomfortable. Thank you Ginger Dr. Deva Khalsa: A plain nebulizer (unheated) with these remedies may help. Ant tart, Silicea and Gelsemium all in 6x potency or something close. I do not know if she has a temperature or not. Also, Sovereign brand Colloidal Silver at \u00bc teaspoon four times a day and 200 IU of Vitamin D once a day for two weeks.
