Commerical Peanut Butter - For convenience and creaminess, commercial peanut butters are normally blended or homogenized. - To stabilize their blends and eliminate the separation of natural peanut butter, some manufacturers may add a small amount (less than 1-2%) of stabilizer. Most major manufacturers do not use trans fats. - For added flavor, some commercial brands may also add a small amount of sugar or salt.

All variations are high in mono- and polyunsaturated fats, which can help improve cholesterol and reduce the risk of disease, as well as several other health benefits.
