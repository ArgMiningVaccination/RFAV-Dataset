For that reasons we repeatedly discussed appropriate primary endpoints with experts and regulators, and assessed scientifically and medically appropriate evaluation indicators and evaluation targets During the Omicron stage of the epidemic, 5 of the typically listed 12 symptoms of COVID -19 (these 5: stuffy or runny nose, sore throat, cough, feeling hot or feverish, and low energy or tiredness) were confirmed as the most common and characteristic symptoms When infected with the Omicron strain, and in a predominantly vaccinated population, the virus proliferates and disappears in the body faster than in the past epidemic stages, and the remission of symptoms is relatively rapid Primary endpoint The time to resolution of five key COVID -19 symptoms Main analysis population Limited to subjects enrolled less than 72 hours from onset of COVID -19 to randomization Confirmatory dose125 mg (Application dose )25Ensitrelvir : Phase 3 part -Summary patient background for registered cases - 125mg N=603250mg N=595Placebo N=600 SexMale 318 323 311 Female 285 272 289 Mean of age 35.9 35.9 35.3 Vaccination of SARS -Cov-2 562(93.2) 551 (92.6) 553(92.2) Time from onset to randomization< 72 hours 347 340 343 72hours 256 255 257 * Intention- to-treat (ITT) All subjects who were randomly assigned to the trial intervention and had a SARS- Cov-2 infection based on RT -PCR. 1,798 subjects excluding 23 subjects that were PCR negative at baseline from 1,821 subjectsBackground information in the ITT* population26Ensitrelvir : Phase 3 part -The time to resolution of all five key COVID- 19 symptoms (Primary endpoint) - Time to resolution of 5 symptoms (< 72 hours) Time from the start of treatment [days]Proportion of event [%] 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 220102030405060708090100 S-217622 250 mg 0.0407 0.0203 ---The time to resolution of all five key COVID -19 symptoms Patients randomized within 72 hours from the onset of symptoms 5symptomsstuffy or runny nose, sore throat, cough, feeling hot or feverish, and low energy or tiredness CI = Confidence Interval [a] Adjusted by the following stratum (SARS -CoV -2 vaccination history [Yes or No]) Significant reduction in the time to resolution of 5 symptoms of COVID -19 characteristic of Omicron strain compared to placebo 01030507090Proportion of event (%) 108 6 4 2 0 12 14 16 18 20 22 Time from the start of treatment (days)27Ensitrelvir : Phase 3 part -Change in viral RNA amount (Key secondary endpoint) - Changes in viral RNA levels on day 4 of administration (after 3 doses) UNIT: log10copies/mL ANCOVA = Analysis of Covariance; SD = Standard Deviation; SE = Standard Error; LS = Least Squares; CI = Confidence Interval Lower limit of quantification of viral RNA is 2.08 log10copies/mL.

Achieved the primary endpoint in the Phase 3 part The time to resolution of the 12 or 14 COVID -19 symptoms also showed a trend towards shortening for the 12 symptoms and a significant shortening for the 14 symptoms Ensitrelvir also showed a significant reduction in viral RNA on day 4 (following the third dose) relative to placebo (greater than 1.4 log10 copies/mL vs. placebo change from baseline on day 4) Population within 120 hours from the onset of symptoms Time to resolution of 5, 12 or 14 symptoms of COVID -19 showed a numerical reduction in the 125 mg group compared with placebo (all with p -values greater than 0.05) Safety There were no serious adverse events or deaths in this trial.
