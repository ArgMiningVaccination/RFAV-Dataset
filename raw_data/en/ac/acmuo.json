Download date: 18-09-2023 Dynamic Modalities and Teleological Agency Plato and Aristotle on Skill and Ability Tamer Nawar Three important claims are made in Republic I concerning the nature of skill or expertise ( techn\u00ea ) and certain kinds of ability or power ( dunamis ): (a) that skills or the abilities constitutive of skill have a certain 'two-way ' nature;(b) that the possessor of skill cannot fail to bring about what they intend or attempt; and (c) that skills or expertise are directed towards some good. These claims are discussed in some detail by Plato and seem to playan important role in Aristotle 's account of techn\u00ea , but it is not clear precisely what these claims amount to, why they might be deemedplausible, or to what degree Plato or Aristotle are in fact committed tothem. In this chapter, I aim to clarify these claims and the attitudes adopted towards them by Plato and Aristotle and thereby further our understanding of dynamic modalities and teleological agency in thethought of Plato and Aristotle. To this end, I rst (Section I ) clarify and explain the precise claims being made in Republic I, which arguably o ers the most detailed surviving treatment of these claims prior to Aristotle. I then ( Section II ) examine how Aristotle incorporates and adapts the relevant claims in developing his own account of skill and ability. I Plato 's Republic on Techn\u00ea What has come down to us as the rst book of the Republic centres on a discussion of the nature of justice. While the conversation focuses on justice, the interlocutors assume or make several claims about techn\u00ea that It is nowadays often claimed that abilities have a two-way nature such that x has the ability to ix has the ability to refrain from -ing. E.g., 'So, if \"p\"stands for \"read \",Cx~p means \"xcan omit reading \".... A fundamental law of ability-logic seems to be this Cxp$Cx~p . Ability to and to omit are reciprocal '(von Wright :). Such claims are often traced back to Aristotle. While there is something to this (see below), as we shall see in this chapter, Plato and Aristotle understand the two- way nature of abilities in ways that di er signi cantly from this modern understanding. of use, available at . https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108641579.003Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core .

I.A Two-Way Skills In examining Polemarchus' views concerning justice, Socrates claims that being skilful or clever ( deinos ) has a certain 'two-way 'nature. The person who is cleverest or most skilful at hitting is pro cient not only at hitting, but is also the cleverest or most skilful at guarding against being hit(Rep. e-). Equally, the person who is clever or skilful at guarding against illness is also pro cient at producing it ( e-), and the same applies to the person who is a good guard of a camp ( a-) in so far as the skilful guard is also a skilful thief ( a). It seems that the 'two-way ' nature of being skilful (deinos ) should be glossed as follows: (Two-Way at -ing, then procient -ing and x is procient at -ing (where -ing and -ing are opposites). It is not entirely clear what (Two-Way Skills) amounts to or why it should be deemed plausible because, although the examples in the Republic suggest that 'being pro cient at -ing 'amounts to being able to well, precisely how the relevant 'opposite 'activities should be understood is less clear. Moreover, it is not entirely clear whether Plato' s Socrates is putting forward this claim about the two-way nature of being skilful merely dialectically or not in Rep. I, whether this claim is meant to hold of technai quite generally or to what degree this claim is taken as true in other dialogues. However, given the importance Aristotle gives to similar claims (seeSection II.A ), the claim merits explication and there seem to be several ways of understanding what (Two-Way Skills) amounts to depending upon how one construes the nature of the relevant 'opposite 'activities. Isocrates closely associates being clever or skillful possessing a enantia in various In general, it seems that opposites may be: contradictories, which are such that everything must be one or the other but cannot be both (e.g., white and not-white) (cf. Rep. d-); polar contraries (e.g., enanti\u00f4tata ,Prt.d), which are exclusive and partially exhaustive in so far as although noteverything must be one or the other, everything that instantiates some more general quality must be one or the other or somehow in between ( Symp. e-b;Prt.d-); contraries, which are such that nothing can be more than one of them in the same respect at the same time, etc. but are not mutually exhaustive (e.g., white, red, green, blue, black) ( Rep. b-c). In the Protagoras , it is suggested that opposites in the relevant sense, seemingly (ii), come in pairs such that each only has one contrary. Thus, for instance, the beautiful only has one contrary: the of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms . https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108641579.003Downloaded from . Sep 2021 at 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termsOne way of attempting to elucidate the notion of opposite activities focuses upon the fact that each of the examples adduced in the Republic involves guarding (phulattein ). Accordingly, one might think that in (Two- Way Skills), -ing and -ing are such that if -ing and -ing are opposites, then one activity is (or involves) guarding against the other. On this understanding, if someone is skilful at hitting (or poisoning, in ltrating a camp), then that person is able to, for example, hit well andable to eectively guard (i.e., 'guard well ') against being hit. Thus understood, the possessor of skill is an e ective doer and an e ective guard against 'being done to '. In so far as there are and always have been bruisers as well as featherweights, the claim is not especially plausible and, at best, it seems to only apply to a fairly circumscribed set of activities (for instance, it is unclear how there could be relevant guarding activities in the case oftraining horses, doing sums, making shoes and many other cases). The degree to which (Two-Way Skills) is assumed elsewhere in Plato 's dialogues is not clear. However, we do seem to be presented with similarviews and other ways of understanding the two-way nature of skill else- where in Plato. For instance, the Hippias Minor seems to o ertwoother ways of elucidating the notion of 'opposite 'activities. On the one hand, in the course of discussing whether those who err intentionally are better than those who err unintentionally in the latter part of the Hippias Minor (c), it is suggested that -ing and -ing are opposites when there exists some one activity (e.g., running) such that -ing is doing that activity well (e.g., running well) and -ing is doing that activity badly (e.g., running badly) (or vice versa) ( Hp. Mi. d-). Thus, for instance, the wrestler who falls intentionally is more skilful than the one who falls unintentionally ( Hp. Mi. a-), the soul that misses the target intentionally is better at archery ( a -b), and the person who intentionally brings about bad results for the body is better at medicine (b-). On the other hand, earlier on in the dialogue, it is initially suggested that the person who is most able to tell the truth about certain things is also best placed to speak falsely about those things because both e ectively speaking the truth and e ectively speaking falsely require knowing the truth ( Hp. Mi. e-a). (The person who wishes to speak falsely but doesn 't know the truth is not able to e ectively speak falsely because they might unintentionally speak truly.) If one equates speaking truly with ugly. Equally, the good only has one contrary: the bad. The high has only one contrary: the low ( Prt. d-c,a-b).Dynamic Modalities from . Sep 2021 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termsspeaking welland speaking falsely with speaking badly, one may perhaps see this as o ering the same account of opposite activities as is o ered later on in the dialogue. However, it seems more natural to say that what is being assumed here is that -ing and -ing are opposites when they are activities that bring about contradictory or polar contrary products. According to this suggestion, the -ing and -ing constitutive of two- way skills are activities that bring about contradictory or polar contrary products. Such a suggestion nds support in the fact that sometimes technai are spoken of as being set over these kinds of 'opposites' or having these kinds of 'opposites 'as their objects.Thus, for instance, although the object of medical skill is sometimes said to be simply bodily health (e.g., Chrm. c; cf.Phdr. b-), other times it is claimed that medicine is set over ordirected at health and illness (e.g., Chrm. e-a) (with something similar applying to several other technai ). Taking skill to have a two-way nature in this manner seems most plausible if we focus on the close connection drawn between technai , measurement and attaining the right balance,and if we suppose that the relevant 'contrary 'states are polar contraries (see above) determinable (cf. Tht. a;Tim. c;Soph. d-e). Thus, for instance, suppose many of the ancients did -thathealth andillness are determinates of some determinable(s)and that health (one determi- nate) is determined by the body being at the right temperature (or having the right balance of cold and hot) while illness is determined by the body being at the wrong temperature.In order to be skilful or clever at healing, one needs to be pro cient at both cooling the body down (when it is too hot) and heating the body up (when it is too cold) (cf. Phdr. a-b). This line of thought is not explicitly developed in much detail, but it may explain the thought that skill has a two-way nature in the relevant sense. Simply put, skill would require both the ability to manipulate the Plato often has Socrates claim that technai areabout (peri) objects Chrm. b-; cf. Grg. cf. Rep. d), but the nature of this aboutness is somewhat fluid. Sometimes it seems like the object of an expertise is an activity that comes about through its exercise (e.g., Grg.d-), other times it is something more like the subject matter or set of facts in the world that the techn\u00ea is directed towards (e.g. Grg. ,;Vict. ;Nat. Hom. . Much the same story could be told if instead of the contraries coldandhot, there is simply heat,a s Philolaus apparently supposed ( Anon. Lond. .-). A similar story can presumably be told concerning the humours (cf. Hippocrates, Nat. Hom. ; Aristotle, Ph.b-). of use, available at . https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108641579.003Downloaded from Sep 2021 at 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termsdeterminable so as to produce one determinate (e.g., health) andalso the ability to manipulate the determinable so as to produce the contrary determinate (e.g., illness). An agent who could only cool bodies down or only heat them up would not be pro cient or skilful. I.B The Modal Pro le of Skill The second relevant claim in the Republic concerns the modal pro le of skills and abilities. After Thrasymachus enters into the conversation, heputs forward his account of justice, according to which 'justice is nothing other than the advantage of the stronger '(Rep. c-), and voices commitment to the following claims: (a) an action is just iit is advanta- geous to the ruler(s) of the polis in which the action was performed (Rep. e-a); (b) if an action is or involves obeying a ruler, then that action is just ( Rep. b-,c -,d -,e ); (c) that rulers are capable of making errors and thus may enact laws which do not bene t themselves ( Rep. c-,d-). On the basis of Thrasymachus 'agree- ment to these claims, Socrates points out that obedience to laws that wereerroneously established (i.e., erroneous because they do not bene t the rulers) will result in actions that are -per (a) -not just (because they are not bene cial to the rulers) and simultaneously -per (b) -just (because they are or involve obeying the rulers). To escape the contradiction,Thrasymachus amends (c) and claims that, speaking precisely, no ruler ever errs and 'no craftsman ever errs '(Rep. e-). Thrasymachus 'views concerning the of practitioners of atechn\u00ea have attracted signi cant opprobrium (e.g., Annas ), but relatively little in the way of detailed discussion or explanation. However, it is worth taking a closer look at what Thrasymachus actually says: [] When someone makes an error in the treatment of patients, do you call him a doctor in regard to that very error? Or when someone makes an error in calculation, do you call him a calculator in regard to that very error in calculation? I think that we express ourselves in words that, taken literally,do say that a doctor or a calculator, or a grammarian errs. However, I think that each of these, insofar as he is what we call him, never errs. Accordingly, according to the precise account -and you are a stickler for precise accounts -no craftsman ever errs. [ ] For it is when his knowledge abandons him that he who goes wrong goes wrong -when he is not a For discussion of what this claim amounts to, see Nawar : n. For a detailed discussion of the relevant scholarly literature, see Nawar .Dynamic Modalities and Teleological Agency of use, available from . Sep 2021 at 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termscraftsman. So that no craftsman, wise man, or ruler makes a mistake then when he is a ruler. ( Rep. d-e, trans. Reeve) In [], Thrasymachus suggests that when a practitioner of a techn\u00ea , for example, a doctor, makes a mistake, the practitioner is not a practitioner with respect to that mistake. This concerns what an ability ( dunamis ) (which is constitutive of the relevant techn\u00ea ) is responsible for and what is constitutive of the actions produced by a practitioner 's ability or capacity. The thought here seems to be that a techn\u00ea of-ing, or the ability ( dunamis ) techn\u00ea , manifests itself only in -ing. If one 's action does not amount to -ing, then that action does not count as a manifestation of one 'stechn\u00ea or ability (cf. Rep. c-d; Aristotle Metaph. b). However, in [ ], Thrasymachus makes clear that not only are errors notto be considered the manifestations of the relevant techn\u00ea (as was claimed in [ ]), but that a practitioner 's possession of the techn\u00ea is incompatible with error and that errors indicate that the relevant techn\u00ea hasabandoned the practitioner at the time of their error.That is to say, if a person errs (i.e., makes an attempt to that does not result in successfully -ing), then they did not possess the relevant techn\u00ea or the relevant ability (constitutive of a techn\u00ea ) at the time of (cf. Rep. c) their error. Thus, Thrasymachus holds or assumes: (Technical Ability) ifShas the ability (constitutive of a techn\u00ea )t oatt, then if Swere to attempt to att,t h e n Swould att. To see how infallibility of the relevant kind is a consequence of (Technical Ability) consider some relevant case, such as that of a gymnastand their relevant ability (e.g., to somersault). If one has the gymnasticability to somersault, then -according to (Technical Ability) -one would somersault if one were to attempt to. If a person were to attempt tosomersault and fail, then that person would nothave the gymnastic ability to somersault at that moment in time. Three points about Thrasymachus' views deserve particular attention. First, although Thrasymachus' claims about the infallibility of techn\u00ea have usually been rapidly dismissed by modern readers, claims like (Technical Ability) are not without some intuitive appeal (similar views were assumed and put forward in several twentieth-century discussions of ability, cf. Nawar :n). This reading of the passage is expanded and defended in greater detail in Nawar . of use, available at Sep 2021 at 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termsSecondly, (Technical Ability) is not idiosyncratically Thrasymachean. (Technical Ability) or views like (Technical Ability) found currency among other ancient theories of techn\u00ea, such as those defended by the Hippocratic authors of On the Art andOn Places in Man . Such authors assumed that technai , or at least certain technai such as medicine, were complete and perfected areas of rational expertise that guarantee success if they are appropriately practised (cf. Nawar ). Thus, for instance, in defending the e cacy of medicine against those who think its successes are due to luck, the author of On Places in Man claims that medical skill has been 'completely discovered 'and does not rely upon luck and that whereas 'luck rules itself and is ungovernable ...knowledge is governable and successful when the one with knowledge wishes to use it ' (Loc. Hom. ,t r a n s .C r a i k ) .T h a ti st os a y ,m e d i c a l techn\u00ea i sac o m p l e t ea n d perfect techn\u00ea (in much the same way that one might speak of an ideal physics ). The doctor 's knowledge is always successful ( eutuch\u00eas ),and whenever the possessor of the relevant kind of knowledge wishes or decides to act or put hisknowledge to e ect, it will indeed successfully come into e ect. Such a view seems to assume (Technical Ability) or some view very much like it. Equally, in arguing that no medical successes should be credited to luck (Art), the author of On the Art argues that medicine is such that its cure of diseases is infallible orfree from error (anamart\u00eatos ,Art,;c f .Rep. c, d-e). In elucidating what such a claim amounts to and attempting to explain away apparent medical failures, the author stresses that when attend-ing to the success guaranteed to genuine doctors one must give attention to the doctor 'sp r o p e rt a s k( ergasia ) and its perfection or end(Art). He claims that it is foolish to equate the patient not recovering with an error on behalf ofthe doctor because, even in the case of curable diseases, the doctor 's activity is not constituted by the patient recovering but by correctly diagnosing the illness and 'by giving proper orders ', that is, prescribing the correct regimen for the patient to follow ( Art;c f .Plt.a-). Notably, the author of On the Art supposes that success requires only ability and not also luck or favourable circumstance (and shapes his construal of 'success 'accordingly). Here eutuch\u00eas has the same meaning as 'successful 'andtuch\u00ea has the same meaning as 'luck '(i.e., it means a situation or outcome due to factors outside the agent's control). In what follows ( Loc. Hom. ), the author moves between this sense of 'luck ', and another sense wherein it means positive outcome or successful actions even if due to the agent. The same ambiguity occurs with 'eutuchia 'in theEuthydemus (cf. Nawar ). The true doctor will only care about the opinion of those who have rationally considered what the task of a craftsman is directed towards and relative to what it may have assessed as perfect (Art). We here nd important precedent for later thought about stochastic technai (cf. Alexander of Aphrodisias, Quaestio .). For discussion arts, and ) in this volume.Dynamic Modalities from . Sep 2021 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termsThirdly, Plato' s Socrates does notdismiss views like (Technical Ability) out of hand and in fact appeals to such views elsewhere. Thus, for instance, while moderation ( s\u00f4phrosun\u00ea) and techn\u00ea are assumed to have an nature in the Charmides (d-a), the Euthydemus oers perhaps the clearest example of Plato' s Socrates appealing to such views (e.g., Euthyd. a-b; cf. Nawar ). In his exhortation to wisdom ( sophia ), Socrates claims that so long as wisdom is present, it guarantees successful action in a manner that is completely free frommistakes (such claims had earlier been made with regard to various technai , Euthyd. d-e). Moreover, it is suggested that the agent who possesses wisdom requires only wisdom in order to be successful. Even if luck or good fortune is not present, the agent is nonetheless guaranteed to succeed. Socrates repeats this thought, adverting to various technai (such as carpentry, musicianship and so on) in order to claim 'knowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea ) seems to provide men not only with good fortune ( eutuchia ) but also with success ( eupragia ), in every case of possession or action ' (Euthydemus a-b). Plato 's Socrates is thus willing to appeal, at least dialectically, to claims like (Technical Ability). However, arguably the most explicit discussion ofthe modal pro le of abilities occurs in the Hippias Minor . There Plato' s Socrates articulates a view that seems similar to (Technical Ability) but issignicantly more modest. Thus, in pressing Hippias on the distinction between being truthful and deceitful (and whether these are two distinct capacities or abilities or not), Socrates discusses what it is to be capable (dunatos) of doing something and claims: But each person who can do what he wishes when he wishes is able. I mean someone who is not prevented by disease or other such things, just as I might say you are able to write my name whenever you wish. Or don 't you say that the person in such a condition is able? ( Hp. Mi. b-c) Some readers have suggested that to explain Socrates' views in the Euthydemus one should take him to have in mind so-called internal-successes: actions that meet certain success criteria purely in virtue of their internal features (rather than their results). Thus, for instance, while the expert strikerwill not always score when he shoots (this would be an example of external-success), he does -the thought goes -always hit the ball well (e.g., with good aim). The proponents of such views have not put forward any textual support for this suggestion, but it is attractive and -as we have seen above - something very much like this was suggested by the author of the On the Art in attempting to defend medicine from apparent failures ( Art-). However, even if we suppose that the agent' s actions are internal-successes, a problematic gap remains. Putting to one side whether, for example,the archer will hit her target or not, why suppose that she will always make a good shot? What lls this gap is (Technical Ability) or a view very much like it. For detailed discussion, see Nawar ; . of use, available at Sep 2021 at 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termsHere, Socrates suggests that the capable person is one who can do what they attempt to do unless they are prevented . That is to say: (Ability*) ifShas the ability to att, then if Swere to attempt to att, andSwere not prevented from -ing, then Swould . (Ability*) allows that preventative factors may mask one 's ability without eliminating one 's ability. (The precise scope of the claim is not clear; it may hold of abilities in general instead of merely the abilities constitutive of technai .) In explicitly making allowances for preventative factors and not clearly excluding luck, (Ability*) is more modest (and more plausible) than(Technical Ability). The person with gymnastic ability who fails in theirattempt to somersault need not lack ability at the time of their failure so long as their failure was due to their being prevented . Precisely how being prevented should be characterised is not entirely clear, but it seems notto be limited to factors extrinsic to the agent since illness is cited as a preventative factor. I.C Directed at the Good The third relevant claim about techn\u00ea in the Republic is that a techn\u00ea is not 'value-neutral 'but is instead directed at what is advantageous or good and, more precisely, what is advantageous or good for its object(s). Socrates puts forwardthis claim in rebutting Thrasymachus 'views concerning justice and ruling ( Rep. b -a;c f .X e n o p h o n ,Memorabilia ..). The claim is sometimes thought to be held by Plato 's Socrates or perhaps even Socrates himself in propria persona (and is sometimes even thought to be central to some of Plato 's thought about techn\u00ea ). However, although there is reason to think the argu- m e n t sS o c r a t e so ers on behalf of the altruistic nature of techn\u00ea are stronger than often supposed (cf. Barney ; Nawar ), one should remember that the relevant claims in the Republic are put forward in a highly dialectical context. Socrates aims to show that, due to Thrasymachus 'own claims about the perfect nature of techn\u00ea , Thrasymachus himself should be committed to the view that techn\u00ea aims at the good of its object (cf. Nawar ). It is unclear what one may surmise about the attitudes of Plato 's Socrates or Plato himself towards the claim. On the one hand, we do nd that Plato' s Socrates does sometimes assume that a techn\u00ea is directed towards the good of its object. On the other hand, it is sometimes That a techn\u00ea is directed towards the good of its object is seemingly assumed in the Gorgias (e.g., e-,d-e,c-b,e-,d-d) and sometimes suggested cf.Soph. from . Sep 2021 at 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termsassumed that a techn\u00ea will produce something that is good or bene cial partly or principally for the practitioner of the techn\u00ea (e.g., Chrm. a- b) and, as was obvious to Plato' s Socrates, many items that seem to be the objects of techn\u00ea -especially inanimate things -are such that it is not clear that they may be bene ted by the practice of the techn\u00ea . One might think that Plato' s Socrates is not committed to the view that each techn\u00ea is directed towards the good of its object, but simply that it is directed towards some good or other or that it is somehow bene cial. This would seem to be supported by the fact that in the Gorgias rhetoric and cookery seem notto be considered genuine technai because they are notappropriately directed towards some good ( a-b,a-,e-; cf.Rep. a-c),and that on several occasions it that the ergon ('task 'or'product ')o fa Chrm. c-e; cf.Ap.c-d;Euthyd. b-a). Some commentators treat the claim that a techn\u00ea must be directed towards some good (or even the good) as central to Plato 's thinking about techn\u00ea (e.g., Woodru ). However, there are several reasons why it is not even clear whether Plato' s Socrates should be taken to be strongly or consistently committed to the view that a techn\u00ea is directed towards the good (or even merely directed towards some good or other).First, one might worry that there is a puzzle in reconciling the good-directed nature oftechn\u00ea (regardless of precisely how we understand the good towards which the techn\u00ea is directed) with the two-way nature of techn\u00ea . Secondly, even if we allow that, for example, weaving produces items of value, theredo seem to be occasions on which various disciplines that do not obviously seem to be good-directed or bene cial seem to be viewed as being technai . Thus, for instance, in the Sophist it might seem that hunting by force (which includes piracy, enslavement and tyranny, Soph. c-)i s recognised as being part of some relevant techn\u00ea . There are various ways in which these diculties might be addressed by those who think that a techn\u00ea is indeed good-directed. For instance, one might respond to the rst diculty by suggesting that the two-way nature of a techn\u00ea is consistent with its being directed towards one of the two Cf.Euthphr. a;Plt.b-; a -. Cookery, rhetoric and the like only aim at what is pleasant and it is not clear, in the relevant works, that pleasure is a good (Grg. e-a,b-). Cookery also . Sep 2021 at 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termsrelevant things (cf. Rep. a-a), or that the two-way nature of a techn\u00ea is consistent with it being directed towards the good and emphasis- ing that, for example, good might be attained through harming as well as healing, or that it is not in any case clear that Plato consistently takes techn\u00ea to have a two-way nature in the relevant way. Equally, one might address the second diculty by allowing that, for example, hunting by force can be good-directed or, more promisingly, by adverting to the dialectical contextof the relevant passages in the Sophist (with attention to whois making the relevant claims). The issue of how techn\u00ea is oriented towards the good is important for understanding not only Plato 's general views about techn\u00ea , but also Plato' s views about virtue (notably with regard to the so-called techn\u00ea analogy), the guise of the good and moral psychology, sophistry and eristic and variousother matters. Such issues merit their own detailed discussion (see, for instance, Roochnik and Rachel Barney 's essay in this volume, Chapter ). Here it su ces to note that it seems that the textual evidence in favour of Plato being committed to each techn\u00ea being good-directed is not entirely clear and, for the reasons already noted (such as the dialectical nature of some of the relevant claims that are sometimes taken out ofcontext), more complex than might be immediately apparent. I have focused on clarifying three claims made in the rst book of the Republic about the nature of skill or expertise. First, Plato' s Socrates suggests that if xis skilful at -ing, then xis procient at -ing and xis procient at -ing (where -ing and -ing are opposites). The claim is treated as obvious, but precisely how that claim should be understood is not entirely clear. In the Republic, it seems the contrary activities are such that one is or involves guarding against the other. Elsewhere, notably in the Hippias Minor ,w end it suggested that the contrary activities are such that one is doing a certain activity well and the other is doing that same activity badly, and we also nd it suggested that the contrary activities are I should add (cf. Nawar ) that determining the degree to which Plato 's Socrates (or a speaker such as the Eleatic visitor in the Sophist and the Statesman ) is sympathetic to the view that each techn\u00ea is good-directed often requires clarifying the nature of politik\u00ea , its relation to knowing the good (which, in the Euthydemus is said to lead into a labyrinth, b) or knowing things just and unjust (cf.

Secondly, in Republic I we also nd that Thrasymachus claims that a techn\u00ea is infallible. This modal claim has usually been rapidly dismissed by modern readers, but the view had wider currency among ancient thinkersand its attractiveness may be better understood when we appreciate thatthe relevant thinkers took technai to be complete and perfected areas of rational expertise and that views like (Technical Ability) are not withoutsome intuitive appeal. Plato 's Socrates appeals to such views elsewhere and in the Hippias Minor he puts forward a similar but more modest and more plausible characterisation of the modal nature of abilities, that is,(Ability*). Thirdly, and nally, it is sometimes thought Plato 's Socrates takes a techn\u00ea to be directed towards the good in some substantive sense; however, I have suggested that the evidence on this matter is notentirely clear. II Aristotle 's Account of Techn\u00ea and Rational Capacities I now turn to Aristotle 's account of techn\u00ea and rational capacities or abilities .It seems that Aristotle regards claims (a)- (c) (see Sections I.A - I.C), of which Republic Ioers the most detailed and focused extant discussion, as being part of the received wisdom of ancient thought about techn\u00ea and several aspects of Aristotle 's thought about dynamic modalities and teleological agency are, I suggest, better understood when we examine how Aristotle attempts to incorporate, adapt, or explain claims (a)- (c) while developing his own account of techn\u00ea . II.A Two-Way Capacities For Aristotle, a techn\u00ea is dunamis ) of a particular kind ( Metaph. a-).Like other (active) capacities, it is 'a principle of move- ment or change in another thing or in a thing insofar as it is other ' (Metaph. a-; cf. a-,b -). However, a techn\u00ea is distinctive in being located in the part of the soul possessing logos (Metaph. b),and in being a two-way capacity: In the Nicomachean Ethics , it is characterised as a hexis (EN a-), that is, an acquired dunamis (cf.Metaph. b -). More concretely, it is in the calculating part of the rational soul ( ENa -). of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms . https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108641579.003Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core . Sep 2021 at 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termsAs regards those capacities which involve reason, the very same capacity is a capacity for contraries, but as regards the non-rational capacities a single capacity is for one thing: for example, heat only for heating, while the medical craft for both illness and health. The explanation of this is that theknowledge is an account, and the same account clari es both the thing and the privation, though not in the same way. ( Metaph. IX. b-, trans. Makin) Aristotle here develops and elucidates the view put forward only brie fly and somewhat obscurely by Plato' s Socrates (who seems to o er the clearest extant parallel to Aristotle 's views on this score). He takes a techn\u00ea to be a two-way capacity for contraries and explicitly states it to be such (and Aristotle explicitly recognises various senses of contraries , e.g., Metaph. a-; contrast, non-rational capacities are seemingly one-way or single-track capacities that manifest themselves only in one sort of activity; for instance, heat manifests itself only in heating.Aristotle does not here discuss why non-rational capacities have a single-track nature so as to manifest themselves only in one sort ofactivity, but his broader views concerning how agents and patients interactseem to explain it roughly as follows. Generally, if an agent (x ) brings about a change in a patient ( y), such that ybecomes (actually) F, then xis actually F. The agent 's form is the origin of change (cf. Ph.a) and, in change, the form of F-ness is somehow conveyed from the agent to the patient ( Ph..,a-)s o that, once the agent has acted upon the patient, the agent and patient havebecome alike with respect to F-ness ( DA II.,a-;GC. I., b-a). Crucially, Aristotle generally seems to think that if xis actually Fand yhas the capacity to become (actually) F, then contact between xandyis both necessary and su cient for the relevant change to occur ( Ph. III.,a-;.,a-b;.,a-b;GC b-).As he puts it in the Metaphysics ,'it is necessary, whenever agent and patient approach each other so as to be capable, the one act andthe other be a ected '(Metaph. IX. a -). Thus, for instance, suppose that something that is actually hot enters into contact with something that is actually cold (and potentially hot). In However, see Metaph. b -; a-. Cf.Metaph. a-; b-;GCb-. I hedge somewhat and say 'seems 'as it is not entirely clear that contact is necessary (perhaps proximity might do the trick; cf. Ph.b-), or that contact between xandyis su cient for xto aecty, as this is sometimes quali ed from . Sep 2021 at 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termssuch cases, the relevant individuals, or their relevant capacities, are con- traries ( enantia) (cf. GCI.,a-). The form of heat in the agent is the principle or origin of change and, necessarily, when the agent andpatient are suitably receptive to each other and brought into contact, thenthe agent heats and the patient is heated ( is only for heating' (Metaph. b; cf.Rep. d-e,c-d). When conditions are right, and two individuals with the relevant capacities standin a suitable relation (e.g., contact), then the relevant process (in this case heating) occurs. (To be clear, just because the patient is heated does not mean that it comes to be hot.) Rational capacities, such as technai ,d ier in several respects from non- rational capacities. First, in the case of non-rational capacities, it seems thatthe form isthe capacity and the relevant origin of change, and that it is straightforwardly present in the individual. With regard to rational capac- ities, Aristotle does take the form to be the origin of change ( Metaph. b-; a-) and supposes that this is somehow conveyed or transmitted to the patient ( GAb-), and he identi es the capacity in a way with the form (e.g., 'medicine is in a way health; house-building is the form of a house ',Metaph. b; cf. GA b-a). However, the form seems to be present in the agent in a somewhat di erent manner (much like redmight be present in a soul thinking of red). Thus the medical practitioner has the form of health intheir soul but presumably need not themselves be healthy. Secondly, rational capacities are under the control of the agent in some suitable sense. Non-rational capacities manifest themselves when external circumstances are right. In contrast, rational capacities manifest themselves when external circumstances andthe agent chooses. Thirdly, rational capacities are two-way capacities. Unlike heat, which can only bring about heating (and necessarily does so when the agent and asuitable recipient are in contact), medical skill can directly bring about not There are some caveats. First, I focus here on the relevant salient change brought about by the active capacity, but the interactions are more complicated. Secondly, as noted, there is sometimes a 'no prevention 'clause (e.g., nothing prevents them from interacting, Ph.b). Thirdly, this is sometimes spoken of as a 'transmission model of agency '(e.g., Makin : -)o ra s 'transference of form '(e.g. Beere ), but Aristotle rarely uses this vocabulary and it is not clear that the labels (which seems more tting to some later thinkers) are entirely apt. It seems that a number of identity claims are at issue: skills or crafts are identical with forms(Metaph. b); crafts are identical with accounts ( a -); and skills or forms are identical with accounts and knowledge (cf. Metaph. b-). Aristotle also claims that 'understanding isan account '( b-; cf. b-). In so far as skills both are and have orinvolve accounts, and we suppose that things may not have themselves, then such remarks present ad iculty when taken literally. of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms . https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108641579.003Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core . Sep 2021 at 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termsjust healing, but twothings: healing and harming or health and illness (cf.EN a-). Thus, we might say that if xhas a rational capacity of-ing, then xcan use the rational capacity to and to (where -ing and-ing are contraries).Crucially, Aristotle thinks b-, it seems to be in virtue of its logos-involving nature that, for Aristotle, a techn\u00ea is a two-way capacity. This requires some explanation. In Metaphysics IX., Aristotle claims that the logos involved in techn\u00ea is about contraries ( b-). More concretely, he claims that a logos is about a thing -presumably the relevant form or universal (e.g., health in the case of medicine) -and its privation ( b-). Furthermore, Aristotle goes on to claim: 'the account con- cerns one contrary per se , but concerns the other contrary in a way incidentally: for it is through denial and negation that it clari es the contrary '(Metaph. b-). Thus, the practitioner of medicine will have an account of health that positively characterises or de nes what health is, and thus concerns health per se. However, since illness is the negation, denial or privation (cf. ster\u00easis , b-) of health, the account of health will also thereby state what illness is per accidens . Thus, suppose that health is a certain balanced mixture of certain elements(cf. PAb-), illness will then be an unbalanced mixture of those elements. Furthermore, Aristotle claims not just that the relevant logos is of contraries, but that the logos 'is in the soul which has an origin of change, so that it will change them [the contraries] both from the sameorigin, having connected them with the same thing '( b-). This suggests that the logos will specify not just what health is, but how health and illness come about or are related to the same thing(cf.Metaph. b-). Aristotle takes the relevant logos to impart explanatory knowledge or understanding. The precise nature of the logos involved in techn\u00ea and how the cognitive aspects of techn\u00ea compare to the cognitive aspects of scienti c Makin o ers: 'A capacity to is a two-way capacity if there can be exercises of the capacity in normal circumstances which are not (even inter alia ) instances of -ing '(Makin : ). However, at best that seems to characterise multi-track capacities, rather than speci cally two-way capacities. Cf.kata ton logon , b-, a-. Aristotle also claims that knowledge or understanding (epist\u00eam\u00ea )isan account ( b-; cf.b -). For recent discussion of logos, see Moss . For Plato, a genuine techn\u00ea is also characterised by possessing a logos (e.g. Grg.a-,a-). However, Aristotle explicitly grounds the two-way nature of a techn\u00ea in its possession of a logos.Dynamic Modalities and Teleological Agency of use, available from . Sep 2021 the Cambridge Core termsunderstanding ( epist\u00eam\u00ea ) are not entirely clear,but the explanatory aspects of techn\u00ea seem divisible into at least two components. First, Aristotle says a techn\u00ea is or is constituted by cognition 'of universals ' (Metaph. a). This contrasts with the seemingly less general and more particularised cognition characteristic of empeiria (a-; cf.a-).At least part of what Aristotle seems to mean by such remarks is that techn\u00ea seems to grant more scienti cally precise cognition that tracks natural properties , that is, what captures facts of resemblance and the relevant causal power or di erence-makers (cf. Nawar ms). Thus one with techn\u00ea will cognise, for example, not merely that Socrates is red in the face, but that Socrates has the symptoms of high blood pressure ( a-). Secondly, the person with techn\u00ea , seemingly in virtue of having the relevant logos, has insight into the relevant causes and natures: 'For expe- rienced people know the that but do not know the why, whereas craftsmen know the why, that is, the cause' (Metaph. a-). The logos will thereby illuminate the nature of the relevant contrary states and their grounds and causes, thereby shedding light on what produces these states. It thus seems that in virtue of having an account of what health is and how it comes about, the practitioner of medicine will also, per accidens , have an account of the nature of illness -which is the contrary (a negation or privation) of health -and how it comes about. The account illuminates the nature of health and the activities that promote it, andthe nature of the contrary states and the contrary activities (i.e., activities that bring about or promote the contrary states). The practitioner is thereby able to impart health to a person (cause health to come about in them), and they are also able to remove health from (i.e., cause illness in) a person. Something similar holds for the other technai . Finally, what determines which of the relevant contrary actions (e.g., healing or harming) an agent with a rational capacity performs (or whetherthey will perform any action at all) is something within the agent thatcontrols the relevant capacity. More concretely: Then there must be something else which is decisive. I mean by this desire or choice. For whichever it desires decisively, in this way it will act when it is in the condition to be capable, and approaches the patient. And so it is necessary The issue merits detailed discussion. Here it su ces to note that the logos and productive reasoning associated with techn\u00ea can, in several important respects, be rather 'scienti c'. For discussion, see Makin :-; Moss ; Johansen ; Nawar ms; Ursula Coope ( Chapter ) in this volume. The relevant content associated with empeiria must, it has been argued, have some level of generality. See, for example, Bolton ( Chapter ). of use, available at Sep 2021 at 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termsthat everything which is capable in accordance with reason, whenever it desires that for which it has the capacity, and in the manner wherein it has the capacity, should act in this way. ( Metaph. IX. a-) Non-rational capacities automatically manifest themselves when they stand in a suitable extrinsic relation. In contrast, rational two-way capacities are such that a meeting of suitably receptive (prospective) agents and patients isnotsucient for the relevant capacities to manifest or be actualised. Instead, what determines whether an active rational capacity in the agent manifests itself, and which way (i.e., which of the two contrary activities) it manifests , is something within the agent: the agent 's overarching or domi- (rational) choice ( prohairesis ). This controls whether a rational capacity will manifest, and which way (i.e., which of two relevant contrary activities) it will manifest. Thus, Aristotle holds that necessarily, ifthe agent 's rational active capacity and the patient 's passive capacity are suitably receptive to each and the right conditions obtain and the agent desires to manifest their capacity, then the agent 's capacity is manifested. There are two worries worth raising concerning Aristotle 's conception of two-way capacities. The rst worry concerns whether onlycrafts and rational capacities have a two-way nature in the manner supposed. We have seen thatthe two-way nature of a techn\u00ea was grounded in its possession of a logos. However, if that is right, then it seems that Aristotle is committed to the view that empeiria , which lacks a logos, should nothave a two-way capacity (or at least, if it did have such a two-way capacity, then it should be grounded in something else). The problem is that, as far as I am aware, it is not clear whether Aristotle takes empeiria to lack a two-way nature. In fact, he says that empeiria and techn\u00ea are 'no dierent with regard to action ' (Metaph. a-) which might be taken to imply that they do not di er in this regard. The second worry, which is perhaps more pressing, concernswhether all rational capacities have a two-way nature in the manner sup- posed. Thus, for instance, we might suppose that the builder is adept at demolishing houses, and perhaps something similar can be said of someother cases (e.g., perhaps the flute-player or the painter may put disharmony in the souls of listeners), but what about, for instance, the cobbler? Neither worry is decisive, but they are worth signalling. II.B The Modal Pro le of Abilities I turn now to attempting to clarify Aristotle 's analysis of capacities and his claim that, when conditions are right, the rational capacity controlled by desire, necessarily results in e cacious action. In Metaphysics IX, AristotleDynamic Modalities and Teleological Agency use, available from . Sep 2021 at 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termsseems to think that that an appropriate speci cation of capacities needs to be more ne-grained than one might expect and that what is needed is either: (a) a more ne-grained speci cation of the circumstances in which a thing possesses a capacity (e.g., xdoes not simply have the capacity to heal, but has the capacity under certain conditions; for instance, when xis not under pressure, xhas the capacity to heal, etc.); or (b) a more ne-grained speci cation of what a capacity does (e.g. xdoes not have the capacity to simply heal, but a capacity-to-heal-when-not-under-pressure or a capacity-to-heal-when-the-equipment-is- handy, etc.). Aristotle initially remarks: 'since what is capable is capable of something at some time and in some way and with however many other factors it isnecessary to add to the speci cation '( b-a). However, while this calls for a more detailed speci cation of something, it does not make clear whether Aristotle prefers (a) or (b) or some other option(e.g., a speci cation of the conditions under which an ability can be exercised ) as a way of proceeding. His later, slightly more expansive remarks are as follows: [] And it has [the capacity] when the patient is present and has [its capacity] in this way; and if not, it will not be capable of acting. [ ] For it is not necessary to specify in addition that nothing prevent it; for it has the capacity in so far as it is a capacity for acting, and that is not in any and every condition, but just in some circumstances, in which external thingspreventing will be ruled out as well; for these are set aside by some of the things present in the speci cation of the capacity. ( Metaph. IX. a-) On a surface reading, [ ] seems to claim that an individual only has the relevant capacity when conditions are right for its exercise.That is to say, the doctor has a capacity to heal only when the patient is present and other conditions are right. In [ ], Aristotle seems to be saying that an accurate speci cation of what a capacity does makes a 'no-interference condition' in the antecedent superfl uous. As regards this latter, it is important to appreciate that Aristotle is almost certainly here engaging with Plato, particularly with the view articulated in the Hippias Minor , that is, with Beere : -seems to take the view expressed in [ ] to be that of the Megarics, but that doesn 't seem right. The Megaric view is that a thing has a capacity to act onlywhen it is acting. of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms . https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108641579.003Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core . Sep 2021 at 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms(Ability*).It seems then that he wishes to reject that view, but his reasons for wanting to do so are not entirely clear. In the most detailed treatment of this issue, Makin ( ) remarks that inMetaphysics IX there is no decisive textual evidence in favour of (a) or (b),but that (b) is a superior reading that better respects Aristotle 's broader commitments (e.g. R: Makin : -, -). In particu- lar, he suggests that (a) should be rejected because it is implausible to suppose, for example, that a person has a capacity to build only when there are bricks present, and that Aristotle seems to think that capacity loss and gain is xed solely by intrinsic features of the agent (such as their coming to have or to lose some knowledge) (Makin :, -). Instead, Makin proposes that Aristotle is nothere discussing the conditions under which an agent possesses a capacity, but rather the conditions under whichan agent is able to exercise their capacity (Makin : -). Thus, for instance, a builder might retain their capacity to build when there are nobricks present, but they would not be able to exercise their capacity. Makin takes Aristotle to hold the following view: 'As regards two-way capacities: necessarily (if agent and patient are in the right condition andrelated in the right way, and the agent chooses to act, then action results) ' (Makin :). The suggestion is charitable and attractive, but it faces various di culties. First, Makin' s'are in the right condition and related in the right way ' remark seems to be functionally equivalent to 'unless preventative condi- tions are present '. However, in [ ]( a-), it seems that Aristotle wishes to reject any speci cation of an ability that makes reference to the absence of preventative conditions and thus seems to wish to reject(Ability*) or views akin to it. Secondly, if Makin is correct, Aristotle 's aversion to talk of preventative conditions is not entirely consistent with his practice (Makin recognises this, :). Thirdly, if Makin is right, Aristotle 's aversion to talk of preventative conditions is somewhat mysterious (and it is not clear to me that Makin' s remarks render Aristotle explicitly engages with that work elsewhere in the Metaphysics (e.g., Metaph. a-). Makin 's two options are put slightly di erently: 'What is capable is capable of something [it is capable] at some time and in some way, etc. '(which he calls 'POSS 'and is seemingly similar to my [a]) and 'What is capable is capable of something-at-some-time-and-in-some-way-etc. '(which he calls 'CONT 'and is seemingly similar to my [b]). Makin adduces Ph.b-andb-, but neither is decisive. E.g., 'Each of these are not capable [of knowing] in the same way. One [is capable] because his genus and matter are of a certain kind; the other [is capable] because he has the capacity to contemplate whenever he wishes, so long as nothing external hinders him '(DAII.,a-; cf. Ph.b-).Dynamic Modalities and Teleological Agency from . Sep 2021 at 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termsAristotle 's aversion less so).Finally, it seems that on Makin's own view, Aristotle resists an analysis that appeals to preventative conditions (e.g., S has the ability to play the piano at ti,a tt,Swere to attempt to play the piano and Swere not prevented from playing the piano, then Swould play), and instead ends up proposing an analysis according to which: Shas the ability-to-play-the-piano-unless-people-are-watching.However, this makes what capacities doseemingly too ne-grained (they are multiplied beyond predictive or explanatory necessity) and if Aristotle does indeed wish to avoid talk of preventative conditions, then this doesn 't seem like a very satisfactory way of doing so. However, despite the objections just raised to Makin's interpretation, the other salient alternative, which makes capacities context and relation- ally dependent, seems damaging to Aristotle 's broader aims and inconsis- tent with his remarks about the acquisition and retention of capacities, which suggests that they are stable features (not easily lost) and contextu- ally robust (such that it is not the case that an agent has a capacity relativeto one situation or circumstance, but not according to another situation or circumstances). It does not seem that it will do to have someone who is a doctor at one moment but not the next, or to have someone who is a doctor when-the-case-is-an-easy-one but not a doctor when-there-are-complications. What is needed then is an analysis of rational capacities that avoids the problems so far raised. Ideally, it should also allow for: (a) occasional failure (e.g., Ph.II.,a-;Metaph. a-); (b) manifestation of the capacity where the typical result aimed at is not possible(Rhet. b-); and (c) some (but not total) adaptability to circum- stance or the manifestation-form of the capacity (e.g., Top. b-). Makin : -suggests that Aristotle resists any speci cation of preventative conditions 'because it is important for him to privilege the role of active and passive capacities (agent and patient); and it is important to do that because it is the active and passive capacities which stand to the change as something potential to something actual '(). However, that doesn 't seem to be suggested by the text and neither is it especially compelling. Specifying the conditions under whicha match acts (e.g., by saying 'if the match were struck and nothing interfered, then it would catch light ') does not, as far as I can see, rob the match of causal power. Cf. Makin : . To be clear, Makin allows that one may have a capacity at a time or in a situation where it is not possible that it be exercised, yet he maintains that some nessing of what capacities do is nonetheless necessary (Makin : -).

Sep 2021 at 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termsWhile matters are di cult, it seems that if one is to provide a uni ed account, then what is required is something (very roughly) along the following lines: (Ability**) ifShas a rational capacity of -ing, then if to attempt to or(where -ing and -ing are contraries) at t, then -most of the time -S would perform the activity they had attempted. (Ability**) might seem to run counter to some of Aristotle 's remarks in Metaphysics IX (e.g., Metaph. a-suggests infallibility and would seem to require success all of the time ). However, Aristotle 's remarks about how generalisations that hold only for the most part (i.e., claims of the form, for the most part ,holds of ) are characteristic of the logos constitutive of technai suggest that what Aristotle is committed to (or perhaps what he should say) is (Ability**) or something like it.(The thought being that the skilled practitioner will be limited in his e ectiveness by the limitations of the generalisations upon which he or she relies.) A full discussion of thisissue merits its own detailed treatment (cf. Nawar ms), but here it suces to note that (Ability**) seems to better re flect Aristotle 's thought in some works and also seems to be a rather good characterisation of abilities (or rational capacities) of the relevant kind. Moreover, in line with ( ), such an account could be supplemented by the speci cation that the activity in question would be strictly the doing of action, rather than the achievement of a speci c result (or perhaps the achievement of a modest result, cf. Rhet. b-). II.C Directed at the Good Finally, I turn to consider Aristotle 's conception of how technai are directed towards the good. The Nicomachean Ethics famously opens with a proclamation to that e ect, stating that every techn\u00ea seems to seek some good ( a-) in a manner that suggests that the claim has wider currency and that it is important. However, Aristotle is clear that a practitioner of techn\u00ea does not need to know the good ( EN a-) and it seems that, contra some readers (e.g., Beere :-), Aristotle 's understanding of the claim that technai are directed towards the good should ultimately be understood in a rather defl ationary manner. E.g. Metaph. b -a;EN b-; see also essays by Bolton ( Chapter ) and Coope ( Chapter ) in this volume. For recent discussion of generic and modal accounts of ability (and the virtues of hybrid accounts), see Maier .Dynamic Modalities and Teleological Agency of use, available at from . Sep 2021 at 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termsIn so far as every techn\u00ea has a logos of some universal and, per accidens ,o f its privation ( Metaph. b-), we may suppose that, for Aristotle, the universals that are the objects of technai are goods (cf. EN a-;EE b-). Thus, for instance, just as medicine takes as its object, health (which is a good), so too we might expect that something similar applies to other technai , and -as Aristotle notes -it is indeed a ne thing to have cognisance of ne things or goods ( EE b-). However, the problem with this line of thought is that even if allthe non-privational objects of technai were in fact goods, and even if Aristotle might say that technai are naturally directed towards the good (cf. EE a-), it is not easy to see in what manner a techn\u00ea can meaningfully be said to be aimed at the good rather than its privation. As we have seen, it is ultimately the agent 's desire that is in control, and it seems that the agent 's desire might be directed towards the good or not (e.g., the doctor 's desires may be directed towards healing orharming). Aristotle does not, as far as I am aware, explicitly speak of any dark arts in any detail and does not explicitly countenance a techn\u00ea or a pseudo- techn\u00ea that is directed towards evils or non-goods, but with regards to those technai that have been put to nefarious ends he claims: What makes a man a sophist is not his abilities but his choices. In rhetoric, however, the term 'rhetorician 'may describe either the speaker 's knowledge of the art, or his choices. In dialectic a man is a sophist because he makes a certain kind of choice, a dialectician in respect not of his choices but of hisabilities. ( Rhet. I. b-) On Aristotle 's view, the sophist and the dialectician di er only in their respective desires and the ends towards which they direct the techn\u00ea (cf.Top. a-b). If that is right, then although Aristotle might say that each techn\u00ea is directed towards the good, it is not clear what this being directed towards amounts to. Like Plato, Aristotle would probably rule out atechn\u00ea that manifests itself in reliably bringing about bad works ( erga), that is, erga that are not brought about adroitly orskilfully (e.g., badly executed paintings, lousy playing of music and the like). However, more explicitly than Plato (and, indeed, perhaps against Plato 's Socrates, depending upon how and whether Plato 's Socrates takes a techn\u00ea to be good-directed) Aristotle seems to allow that there are technai whose erga are or may be morally bad. Accordingly, it seems that the principal way inwhich a techn\u00ea can be said to be directed towards the good is that it is useful (cf. chr\u00easimos ,Rhet. a) and that, on the whole (or, for the most part), the practitioners of a techn\u00ea (and their desires) tend to be of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms . https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108641579.003Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core . Sep 2021 at 06:50:27 , subject to the Cambridge Core termsdirected towards the good. However, if that is right, then it doesn 't seem that a techn\u00ea can be said to be good-directed in any particularly strong sense and the claim is less important than is sometimes thought. III Conclusion In this chapter I have attempted to clarify three important but poorly understood claims in the thought of Plato and Aristotle: (a) that skills or the abilities constitutive of skill have a certain 'two-way 'nature; (b) that the possessor of skill cannot fail to bring about what they intend or attempt; and (c) that skills are good-directed. We have seen the precise form these claims take in Republic I, why they might be thought plausible, and how Plato 's Socrates and Aristotle engage with them. Each of the claims deserves further attention, but in the course of this chapter I hope tohave advanced our understanding of these claims and of Plato 's and Aristotle 's views on the modal and teleological aspects of techn\u00ea .
