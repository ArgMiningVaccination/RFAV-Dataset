He responded on August 22, 2019, but seeing little improvement in the licensing timelines, WSMA sent a letter to the Governor' s Office with their concerns on November 4, 2019. There are many moving parts to processing an initial application for a license to practice in Washington, requiring a lot of information to be reviewed by the staff or Commission before approving the application. In the past, the applicant was tasked with obtaining this information and providing it to the Commission. Over the passage of time, this information can be obtained from other reliable sources, thus negating the requirement for the applicant to provide it. Due to updated technology and access to information by other entities, we can now rely on getting and verifying much of the information required through the following pathways: AMA (American Medical Association) The profile information contained in the AMA Physician Masterfile meets selected primary source verification requirements of the Joint Commission, the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) AND THE American Accreditation Health Care Commission (AAHCC) AND THE American Accreditation Health Care Commission (AAHCC)/Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC). The AMA Physician Masterfile is also an NCQA-approved source for verification of medical school, post-graduate training, ABMS Board Certification, and federal DEA registration. (FSMB) Federation of State Medical Boards Practitioner Profile includes Board actions, NPI number, license history (out of state license) DEA, and ABMS certification if any. (NPDB) National Practitioner Data Bank The NPDB report provides information about medical malpractice payments, adverse licensure or privileges actions, or judgments and convictions , if any. (WATCH) Washington Access to Criminal History Report provided by the Washington State Patrol (WSP). All criminal history record information is provided to WSP by courts and criminal justice agencies. FBI Fingerprints The scanned fingerprints sent electronically to Washington State Patrol (WSP). If a nation al background check is required, WSP forward s the fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Memorandum WMC May 2020 Mtg Pkt Page 49 of 231Application Review Process followed: The Licensing staff reviewed the current initial application for physicians and physician assistants. They ar e virtually identical, with some differences in education, so the physician application will be used as the example with the caveat that all changes made to the physician application will also be made to the PA application. Licensing developed a matrix of where information currently required from the applicant could be obtained through another verifiable source as described above, thus negating the need for the applicant to provide it. Panel L met to review the current initial application and discuss each question asked and every piece of information requested from the applicant to determine if the question was still applicable and if the information requested could be lessened to remove some burden from the applicant and decrease processing timelines. Proposed Revisions: 1. Remove NPI number requirement - provided by AMA Physician Profile 2. Add gender \"X\" option - required by Department. 3. Remove fax number requirement - we don't use that technology anymore. 4. Personal data questions - retained, but reworded, and put in a slightly different chronology. 5. Education - Licensing will use the information contained in the AMA Physician Masterfile that meets selected primary source verification requirements of the Joint Commission, the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC), the American Accreditation Health Care Commission (AAHCC) and the American Accreditation Health Care Commission (AAHCC)/Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC). The AMA Physician Masterfile an NCQA-approved source for verification of medical school, post-graduate training, ABMS Board Certification, and federal DEA registration. 6. Professional Experience - revised to request information for the last 7 years, with a requirement to explain any gaps of 30 days or more. 7. Hospital privileges - Information provided in applicant's National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) and no longer needed to be supplied by applicant. 8. Licenses in other states - information provided by AMA Physical Profile, FSMB Practitioner Profile and NPDB report and no longer needed to be provided by applicant. 9. AIDS Education and Training Attestation - no longer needed. 10. Photograph - not required for licensing purposes. 11. Attestation - remains the same.

Such direction must be for acts which 16 are within the scope of registered nursing practice. 17 (3) A registered nurse may delegate tasks of nursing care to 18 other individuals where the registered nurse determines that it is in 19 the best interest of the patient. 20 (a) The delegating nurse shall: 21 (i) Determine the competency of the individual to perform the 22 tasks; 23 (ii) Evaluate the appropriateness of the delegation; 24 (iii) Supervise the actions of the person performing the 25 delegated task; and 26 (iv) Delegate only those tasks that are within the registered 27 nurse's scope of practice. 28 (b) A registered nurse, working for a home health or hospice 29 agency regulated under chapter 70.127 RCW , may delegate the 30 application, instillation, or insertion of medications to a 31 registered or certified nursing assistant under a plan of care. 32 (c) Except as authorized in (b) or (e) of this subsection, a 33 registered nurse may not delegate the administration of medications. 34 Except as authorized in (e) of this subsection, a registered nurse 35 may not delegate acts requiring substantial skill, and may not 36 delegate piercing or severing of tissues.

Nurses shall not be subject to any employer 3 reprisal or disciplinary action by the nursing care quality assurance 4 commission for refusing to delegate tasks or refusing to provide the 5 required training for delegation if the nurse determines delegation 6 may compromise patient safety. 7 (e) For delegation in community-based care settings or in-home 8 care settings, a registered nurse may delegate nursing care tasks 9 only to registered or certified nursing assistants or home care aides 10 certified under chapter 18.88B RCW. Simple care tasks such as blood 11 pressure monitoring, personal care service, diabetic insulin device 12 set up, verbal verification of insulin dosage for sight-impaired 13 individuals, or other tasks as defined by the nursing care quality 14 assurance commission are exempted from this requirement. 15 (i) \"Community-based care settings\" includes: Community 16 residential programs for people with developmental disabilities, 17 certified by the department of social and health services under 18 chapter 71A.12 RCW; adult family homes licensed under chapter 70.128 19 RCW; and assisted living facilities licensed under chapter 18.20 RCW. 20 Community-based care settings do not include acute care or skilled 21 nursing facilities. 22 (ii) \"In-home care settings\" include an individual's place of 23 temporary or permanent residence, but does not include acute care or 24 skilled nursing facilities, and does not include community-based care 25 settings as defined in (e)(i) of this subsection. 26 (iii) Delegation of nursing care tasks in community-based care 27 settings and in-home care settings is only allowed for individuals 28 who have a stable and predictable condition. \"Stable and predictable 29 condition\" means a situation in which the individual's clinical and 30 behavioral status is known and does not require the frequent presence 31 and evaluation of a registered nurse. 32 (iv) The determination of the appropriateness of delegation of a 33 nursing task is at the discretion of the registered nurse. Other than 34 delegation of the administration of insulin by injection for the 35 purpose of caring for individuals with diabetes, the administration 36 of medications by injection, sterile procedures, and central line 37 maintenance may never be delegated. 38 (v) When delegating insulin injections under this section, the 39 registered nurse delegator must instruct the individual regarding 40 p. 20 SHB 2378.PL WMC May 2020 Mtg Pkt Page 81 of 231proper injection procedures and the use of insulin, demonstrate 1 proper injection procedures, and must supervise and evaluate the 2 individual performing the delegated task weekly during the first four 3 weeks of delegation of insulin injections.

Nurses acting within the protocols 16 of their delegation authority are immune from liability for any 17 action performed in the course of their delegation duties. 18 (viii) Nursing task delegation protocols are not intended to 19 regulate the settings in which delegation may occur, but are intended 20 to ensure that nursing care services have a consistent standard of 21 practice upon which the public and the profession may rely, and to 22 safeguard the authority of the nurse to make independent professional 23 decisions regarding the delegation of a task. 24 (f) The nursing care quality assurance commission may adopt rules 25 to implement this section. 26 (4) Only a person licensed as a registered nurse may instruct 27 nurses in technical subjects pertaining to nursing. 28 (5) Only a person licensed as a registered nurse may hold herself 29 or himself out to the public or designate herself or himself as a 30 registered nurse. 31 Sec. 19.

Most of our processes are electronic enabling us to do this without too much disruption. For those processes requiring staff to go into the office, they do so sparingly, stay for a short time to pick up mail or hardcopy licensing applications and leave. During their time in the building, they are a dhering to the social distancing requirements. To stay connected to staff, virtual team meetings occur regularly, supervisors touch base with their staff and we meet virtually for socializing...we had a virtual lunch together last week. I have also had a vi rtual coffee break with the Pharmacy Commission's ED to touch base with what they are doing. The FSMB held its annual House of Delegates meeting - Dr. Roberts was our delegate and he attended virtually. In February, I was selected by FSMB to be a Staf f Fe llow on the FSMB Board of Directors for the next 2 years. I was also asked by the new Chair, Dr. Cheryl Walker - McGill to chair FSMB's Workgroup on Board Action Content Evaluation (BACE) for a one - year term from May 2020 -April 2021. The charge of the BACE workgroup is as follows: Identify recommended standards to ensure that board orders contain adequate information to identify the actions and reasons for discipline, including examples on how to write narratives of complaint and action that can be shared with state attorneys general, board attorneys, and related organizations; Support pilot projects to study best practices for collection and analysis of complaint data and relation to official board orders; and Provide recommendations to automate complaint collection and analysis process. I will keep you informed of what that workgroup is doing as I get more involved. We are hoping to start transitioning back to the office in June -July. That time is dependent on many factors to insure we all stay healthy. Again, you will be kept informed as we know more. Thank you for your patience and nimbleness throughout the se past months as we changed the way we live and work to stay healthy and safe. Micah Matthews, Deputy Executive Director Recurring : Please submit all Payroll and Travel Reimbursements within 30 days of the time worked or travelled to allow for processing. Per Agency policy, requests submitted after the cutoff cannot be paid out. Legislation There will likely be a special session called during 2020 to reduce/trim budget expenditures. There will likely be across the board cuts requested. So far, WMC does not appear to be directly implicated in those requests. WMC May 2020 Mtg Pkt Page 225 of 231Micah Matthews, Deputy Executive Director , con 't For the 2021 session, we are soliciting ideas for WMC requests. Items under cons ideration are some form of emergency powers for licensing and rule issues during states of emergency. If you have thoughts on request legislation, please email me: Micah.Matthews@wmc.wa.gov Budget The techn ical problem with our AGO budget request was resolved and we have had the $400,000 allotment added to our current budget. This is not new money, but new spending authority to cover the increased costs of prosecutions from that office. I do not anticipate a ny budget requests to the legislature for the 2021 session. Finance The new fees went into effect February 1 and collections were understandably up. However, the Secretary implemented a six month delay in paying for renewals for all health professions. The first month of this renewal fee waiver has resulted in a n approximate 30 percent reduction in paid renewals. While this will not permanently impact our budget as these renewal fees are due October 1, it has significantly blunted the impact of the fee incr ease. As a result, it may take slightly longer to reverse the downward trend in our fund balance than anticipated. We will know more specifics as we see additional months of renewal numbers pass and reach the October 1 deadline for payment of waived renewals. Despite the above renewals discussion, monthly finance reports remain encouraging from the standpoint of overall budget expenditures compared to projections , cost recovery through STIDS, and indirect charges from DOH. Due to reduced expenditures across DOH and COVID related impacts, which generates the formula percentage for indirect rate charges to us from the agency, the indirect rate charge from HSQA is anticipated to experience a reduction. We do not know at this time what the impact will be. Communications I am regularly engaging with stakeholders on various issues relating to COVID and policy issues. The most recent as of this writing is the extension of the health care practitioner waiver proclamation by the Governor and Legislature to May 3 1. Chair Request: Keeping in Contact During COVID During the quarantine I am using regularly scheduled video meetings with individual staff, instant messaging, and ad hoc phone meetings. On May the Fourth, I held my first in -person meeting in the office.

Several processes are \"going digital\" and staff members completed or are in the process of completing training . Two examples: 1) using digital signatures on specific contracts and 2) digital archiving. A few members also attended virtual training on the new DOH Public Disclosure Request System that is scheduled to launch soon. George Heye, MD, Medical Consultant Nothing to report. Morgan Barrett, MD, Medical Consultant As most of you know , the April and May Personal Appearances were cancelled in conformity with the Governor's Proclamation and prudent public health practices that have come to be known as \"Social Distancing \". With advice from the Legal Unit, and abundant support of the Administrative Staff, we are currently exploring the potential feasibility , safety and desirability of hosting interim \"Virtual Personal Appearances \" (VPA) using GoToMeeting . We envision adhering to the conventional format (after the Business Meeting, Panels A and B, etc.) except for a change regarding the executive session. The first VPA will likely occur at the July Commission meeting. Rick Glein, Director of Legal Services Legal Staff Updates: Richelle Little joined the Medical Commission on March 16 as our newest Staff Attorney. Richelle comes to us after working as a Staff Attorney in the HSQA/OILS division of DOH and is well -versed in the disciplinary process having worked on cases for the De ntal Commission, Osteopath Board, and the Chiropractic Commission. Previously, Richelle worked with Institutional Review Board (IRB) members and physicians for four years at Western IRB. She provided regulatory guidance on a variety of medical research, in cluding pharma and device studies.

Richelle graduated from the UW School of Law in 2007. Orders Resulting from SOCs: In re Dung X. Nguyen, MD , Case No. M2018 -716, Agreed Order. On February 20, 2019, the Commission filed a SOC against Dr. Nguyen. Dr. Nguyen operated a private practice clinic in Tacoma, Washington. During an investigation of a patient diagnos ed with hepatitis C virus (HCV), staff members from the Department of Health's Healthcare Associated Infection Program and the Tacoma -Pierce County Health Department visited Dr. Nguyen's clinic and concluded that three intravenous \"energy treatments\" recei ved at Dr. Nguyen's office were a likely source of the HCV infection. An Agreed Order was signed on February 27, 2020, wherein Dr. Nguyen agreed to permanently surrender his medical license. In re Jackie S. Shuey, PA -C, Case No. M2018 -589, Agreed Order. On August 26, 2019, the Commission filed a SOC against Ms. Shuey. The alleged incidents in the SOC all occurred during a time Ms. Shuey worked as a physician assistant -certified at a state Department of Corrections (DOC) facility. An Agreed Order was s igned on April 17, 2020, which found Ms. Shuey's treatment of two patients did not meet the standard of care and Ms. Shuey failed to adequately supervise staff by allowing registered nurses and a medical assistant work outside the scope of their practices at the DOC facility. The Agreed Order provides four years of oversight and requires Ms. Shuey to work with another clinician on -site or have another clinician easily accessible; complete a CME course in professional boundaries; maintain NCCPA certificati on; research and write a scholarly paper; ensure submission of performance reports by her supervising physician; attend personal appearances; and pay a $3,000 fine. Meeting Attendance: On Friday, May 1, the Legal Office held a case law roundtable with Rick, Kyle, Jen, all six of our staff attorneys, and both paralegals in attendance. Additionally, Mike Farrell and all eight staff attorneys, including Rick's counterpart, Karl Hoehn, from the Nursing Commission joined the ninety -minute call. Each of the Medical staff attorneys was given a case to present along with a series of questions that related to the practical application of the court's holding on disciplinary cases. (For example, applying Brown to a hypothetical question from licensing staff.) Presentations were limited to fifteen -minutes. The presentation also gave SAs a chance to work on their virtual presentation skills. The cases covered were: Dang /Ongom /Hardee . The response was positive and it was especially nice to have Mike and Karl there given their nearly sixty years of combined UDA experience. We may do something similar again later this summer with Nursing where we provide hypotheticals and the SAs prepare a proposed response. Engagement While Telecommuting : Kyle is meeting weekly in one -on-ones with all six staff attorneys. The calls vary from short check -in discussions to much longer focused discussions. The topics also range from relaying information from both WMC and DOH management to reviewing pending c ases to talking WMC May 2020 Mtg Pkt Page 228 of 231Rick Glein, Director of Legal Services, con 't about more big picture topics. Kyle and Rick also meet individually with each staff attorney on the Tuesday or Wednesday prior to case disposition call to discuss each case where the RCM is presenting, i.e. not using the consent agenda. Jen is holding weekly virtual team meetings with the Legal support staff. In addition, Jen is checking in weekly with individual support staff along with calling them for a one -on-one chat rather than using e -mail for random discussions to stay connected. The discussions range from big picture administrative topics, such as preparing for the Commission meeting, to specific discussions about case filings. Another component of the dialogue is the support staff's overall health during this time, reminding th em to effectively utilize the 30 -minute wellness break offered by DOH; take consistent breaks from the computer screen; and change positions, being cognizant of stress and strain from working at their makeshift home office set -up. Freda Pace, Director o f Investigations Good Morning, Commissioners! The Investigative Unit continues to work remotely during this time. We meet virtually via Skype on a weekly basis or as unique needs arise to tackle the various business needs within our unit. We are working well in finding unique ways in adhering the Governor's Proclamation by not only practicing social distancing, but being able to successfully fulfill our very important business needs.
