The revision also served to ramp up the World Bank's own engagement in the forest sector to reduce poverty without jeopardizing the environmental values intrinsic to sustainability. The strategy is founded on three equally important and interrelated pillars: \u007f harnessing the potential of forests to reduce poverty in a sustainable manner; \u007f integrating forests more effectively into sustainable development; and\u007f protecting vital local and global environmental services and values. Addressing these three pillars together makes the Forests Strategy complex and multifaceted. The Strategy is not just about growing or protecting trees, but involves a web of complex interactionsbetween policy, institutions, and incentives. The Forests Strategy embodies a multisector approach that takes into account activities, policies, and practices outside the forest sector that impact both forests and the people who depend on forests for their livelihoods. The Forests Sourcebook is a resource for World Bank clients, task managers, and other stakeholders to better design and implement projects in line with the Forests Strategy. It draws on the experiences of more than seventy experts, both within and outside the World Bank, who have applied innova-tive approaches to implementing the World Bank Forests Strategy. The Sourcebook is divided into two parts. The first part looks at issues that are priorities for the forest sector and addresses the operational aspects of those issues. It covers topics associated with using forests in ways that contribute to poverty reduction, improving forest governance, main- streaming forest considerations in macro policy dialogue, engaging the private sector, meeting thegrowing demand for wood, optimizing forest functions at the landscape level, and monitoring forest sector activities. The second part of the book offers guidance on implementing the WorldBank's Operational Policy on Forests (OP 4.36). Giving insight into the complex interplay between different realms of development work that effect or are affected by forests, the Forests Sourcebook is a valuable tool for any stakeholder involved in development or business projects that could have an impact on forests.

In the 21st century, agriculture remains fundamental to economic growth, poverty alleviation, and environmental sustainability.The World Bank's Agriculture and Rural Development publication series presents recent analyses of issues that affect agriculture's role as a source of economic development, rural livelihoods, and environmental services. The series is intended for practical application, and we ho pe that it will serve to inform public discussion, policy formulation, and development planning.

The Forests Sourcebook is divided into two parts. The first contains an introduction to the book plus seven chapterscovering topics associated with enhancing the contribution of forests to poverty reduction, engaging the private sector,meeting the growing demand for forest products, optimizingforest functions at the landscape level, improving forest gov-ernance, mainstreaming forest considerations into macro -policy dialogue, and monitoring forest sector activities. Each chapter provides relevant background and context with a general overview of the fundamental issues, con-straints, policies, and institutional requirements that needto be considered for specific topics. Each also provides therationale for engagement and a brief discussion of pastWorld Bank activities in the particular area. Most impor-tant, chapters specify future priorities and areas for scalingup activities. Each chapter also provides a list of key read-ings or sources of information. Often the topics presented ina chapter are closely related to issues presented in otherchapters and notes. Cross-references are provided. Associated with each chapter is a series of notes that dis- cuss various tools or approaches for tackling specific issues highlighted in the chapter. The notes provide an overviewand considerations of interest regarding a specific issue, dis-cuss operational aspects, have recommendations for practi-tioners that include lessons learned, and list selected read-ing. Some notes have boxes that contain innovative activityprofiles and good practices. Where relevant, a note hasannexes that contain checklists or content for terms of ref- erence for specific activities or relevant frameworks and def-initions. Like the chapter, information presented in notes is often closely related to issues presented in other chapters and notes. Again, cross-references are provided. The second part provides guidance for implementing the World Bank's safeguard on forests. This section of theForests Sourcebook has five chapters. Chapter 8 provides a brief introduction to the World Bank's Forests Policy (OP 4.36). Chapter 9 is on applying OP 4.36. This chapterincludes a discussion of the main requirements of OP 4.36,guidelines for implementation (including preparation,appraisal, and supervision requirements), definitions, and guidance on identifying critical forests and critical natural habitats through environmental assessment, which includesa discussion on protecting forests through conservation off-sets. Chapter 10 is on consultation and communication inforest projects. Chapters 11 and 12 discuss the Forest Certi-fication Assessment Guide and the World Bank's IndigenousPeoples policy, respectively. It should be noted that the guidance on applying the World Bank's OP 4.36 pertains only to World Bank invest-ment projects. Development Policy Loans must abide by therequirements of OP 8.60 (discussed in chapter 6, Main-streaming Forests into Development Policy and Planning: Assessing Cross-Sectoral Impacts). WHAT IS NOT COVERED BY THE FORESTS SOURCEBOOK The Forests Sourcebook draws on bodies of completed and ongoing work that provide innovative and operationally rel- xxvA USER'S GUIDE TO THE FORESTS SOURCEBOOKevant tools for implementing the World Bank's Forests Strat- egy. These tools often require an understanding of severalother key processes and programs, some of which are not covered by the Forests Sourcebook, including the following: Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and Country Assistance Strategy preparation processes. Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) (see http://go.world bank.org/FXXJK3VEW0) describe a country's macroeco-nomic, structural, and social policies and programs to pro-mote growth and reduce poverty, as well as associated exter-nal financing needs. PRSPs are prepared by governmentsthrough a participatory process involving civil society and development partners, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Country AssistanceStrategies (CAS) (see http://go.worldbank.org/4M75BI76J0) are business plans prepared by the World Bank foractive borrowers from the International Development Asso-ciation (IDA) and the International Bank for Reconstruc-tion and Development (IBRD). The CAS takes as its startingpoint the country's own vision for its development, asdefined in a PRSP or other country-owned process. Other World Bank Operational Policies. This book focuses on Operational Policies on Forests (OP 4.36) and Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10) and refers to others. All WorldBank investment operations are governed by the Bank'sOperational Policies, which are designed to ensure that allprojects and activities are ec onomically, financially, socially and environmentally sound. The World Bank's Operational Manual spells out the policies and provides procedures and other forms of guidance on how to comply with the policies. See http://go.worldbank.org/2G5SSZAET0. Detailed discussion on due diligence as per OP 8.60. The key issues surrounding forest due diligence as per OP8.60 are covered in chapter 6.

IFC Environmental and Social Standards. The Interna- tional Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, has its own set of environmental and socialstandards, including Performance Standards and Environ-mental, Health, and Safety Guidelines, that are applicable toall projects the IFC finances.

Forests and the forest products indus-try are a source of economic growth and employ- ment, with the value of global forest products traded inter- nationally reaching US$270 billion, of which developingcountries account for more than 20 percent. Worldwide,forest industries provide employment (both formal andinformal) for approximately 50 million people. Forests are home to at least 80 percent of the world's remaining terrestrial biodiversity and are a major carbon sink regulating global climate. Forests also help to maintainthe fertility of the soil, protect watersheds, and reduce therisk of natural disasters, such as floods and landslides. Global deforestation and degradation threaten biodiversity, forest-related ecological services, and rural livelihoods. Covering 26 percent of the Earth's land surface, forests play a significant role in realizing the Millennium Develop-ment Goal (MDG) of halving the number of people livingin absolute poverty by 2015. Unfortunately, rural develop-ment strategies often neglect forests because forests havebeen mistakenly viewed as being outside the mainstream ofagricultural development. In addition to the lumber andwood products industry, the gathering and marketing ofhundreds of forest products, such as forest fruits, fuelwood,and medicinal products, constitute an economic activity of enormous scale. As human populations grow and countries around the world become more affluent, the demand for wood prod-ucts, both solid wood and pulp and paper, will increase, too. 1OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE FOREST SECTORINTRODUCTION In 2005, removals of roundwood were valued at about US$64 billion, an increase of about 11 percent overremovals in 1990. The demand for nonwood forest products has also increased since 1990, with removals estimated at US$4.7 billion in 2005. The contribution of forests to the maintenance of vital ecosystem functions and societal well-being is increasingly amatter of public concern. People are realizing that water sup- ply and quality, flood protection, soil conservation, local cli-mate, and conservation of biodiversity all rely on the existenceof functioning forest ecosystems. Most developed-countrygovernments have now committed to increased funding forcarbon sequestration and effective protection of forest biodi- versity, and these commitments are likely to be extended to reducing emissions from forest land conversion. WHY THE POTENTIAL OF FORESTS HAS NOT BEEN FULLY HARNESSED Forests house global public goods, which, to be maintained, must be both protected and managed sustainably. At pres-ent, however, less than 5 percent of tropical forests are being managed sustainably. Despite their great economic value, forests are one of developing countries' most mismanagedresources. Many countries with substantial forest resourceshave been subject to corruption and serious inadequacies inforest allocation, administration, and monitoring. Illegal logging and associated trade and corruption at high levelsflourish because timber rights can be extremely valuable.Besides channeling potential timber revenue away from national development efforts\u2014particularly from the peopleliving in and near the forests\u2014the low prices at which these concessions are often granted encourage waste, unsustain- able management, plundering for short-term gain, andreplacement by less valuable and less sustainable activities.Strengthening of governance usually touches upon sensitivelocal and national interests, which are benefiting from the status quo. Furthermore, growing populations lead to an increase in the conversion of forests for other land uses (for example,clearing of forests for agriculture; see figure 1). The Foodand Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that each year 13 million hectares of forest are permanently converted to agriculture, mostly in the tropics. Spillovers from poorpolicies in other sectors can also contribute to rapid rates ofdeforestation. This has been particularly evident in recentdecades, for example, in the conversion of forest areas to oilpalm plantations in Indonesia. Although some forest products, primarily lumber and fuelwood, are delivered through markets, the economicvalue of many of the other forests goods and services (forexample, environmental services, biodiversity, and carbonsequestration) go unrecognized by the market. Creative newmechanisms are needed to compensate those preserving environmental services and to provide incentives throughmarket-based methods to reduce loss of forests' environ- mental services. Safeguarding global public goods is not a national prior- ity in countries struggling with problems of poverty reduc- tion. As a result, forests' potential is unexploited in develop-ing countries because the forest sector has to compete fordevelopment investment and governments have limitedinterest in investing in the sector through loans when the benefits are often global rather than national or local. Theseinvestments must compete for resources against such highpriority sectors as health, education, and infrastructure.Weak governance in the forest sector is pervasive and leadsto ineffective use of funds. Forest authorities often lack the capacity to implement policy reforms and programs effec- tively and have limited capacity to access, and make use of,extra-budgetary financing. Furthermore, incentives for theprivate sector to implement sustainable forest managementare either absent or limited. The forest sector represents one of the most challenging areas in the development of community and global publicpolicy. Despite significant resource flows, international con-cern, and political pressure, a combination of market andinstitutional failures has led to forests failing to realize theirpotential to reduce poverty, promote economic growth, andbe valued for their contributions to the local and global environment. UNLOCKING FORESTS' POTENTIAL The problem of sustainable forest management (SFM) is highly complex and can only be addressed by a range ofactions targeted at (i) the policy framework, (ii) strength- ening of governance, (iii) removal of market distortions and engaging market actors, (iv) full valuation and sharingof forest benefits through market and other mechanisms,(v) capacity building, and (vi) mobilization of adequatefinancial resources. Countering the drivers of deforestation and forest degra- dation to enable sustainable forest management will require, among other factors, greater innovation and better coordina-tion in global forestry dialogue, national sectoral planning,and technical analysis that addresses these forces and factors. Capturing the potential of forests to advance poverty reduc- tion, support economic growth, and deliver local and globalenvironmental services will require donors to work in closecoordination with governments, the private sector, and otherkey stakeholders in the forest sector, and to link forest sectoractivities with national strategies. This can involve workingwith emerging external constraints and opportunities. 2 INTRODUCTION: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE FOREST SECTOR10,00020,00030,00040,00050,00060,000 Africa Latin AmericaAsia Pan- TropicalConversion of forest area to small-scale shifting agriculture Conversion of forest area to small-scalepermanent agriculture and other land uses Conversion of forest area to large-scalepermanent agriculture or other land uses Conversion to agricultural and forest plantationsFigure 1 Main Causes of Deforestation, by World Region, 1990-2000Forest law enforcement and governance. Loss and degradation resulting from weak forest law enforcement and governance have occurred at the expense not only of national economies, but also of the rural people who depend on forest resources for their livelihoods. Thismismanagement translates into enormous national costs.For example, failure to collect appropriate royalties and taxesfrom legal forest operations has a global cost to governments of about US$5 billion annually. Illegal logging results inadditional losses of forest resources from public lands of atleast US$10 billion to US$15 billion a year. Improvements inforest law enforcement and governance are critical tocapturing the full economic potential of forests in a sustainable manner. In response, a stronger global focus has been placed on forest sector governance, accountability, andtransparency (see chapter 5, Improving Forest Governance). Private sector engagement. Because of forests' significant commercial value, the private sector is the principal source of finance in forest production in most countries. Indeed, thelevel of activity and influence of the private sector in forestsdwarfs that of the international community\u2014andsometimes of the national government. Private investmentin the forestry sector in developing countries and countriesin transition is close to US$15 billion per year, or up to nine times more than the current official development assistanceflows. 1Official development assistance accounted for only a fraction of the funds available for forestry in the mid-1990s, and has declined sharply since then. Private sector investment\u2014from both domestic and for- eign sources\u2014has been on the upswing. Given this trend of increased private engagement in forest production and pro-cessing, legal and regulatory frameworks that support sus-tainable forest practices must be developed to promote responsible private sector investment and corporate socialresponsibility as well as to eliminate corruption. T o enhancethe role of private sector investment in poverty alleviation,effective and efficient community-company partnershipsand greater support to small and medium forest enterprises will be critical. Increased community engagement in forest management. Local communities, including indigenous and traditional groups, play an increasingly important rolein forest management. Studies of the ownership andadministration of forests anticipate that forest areas underrecognized community ownership and reserved forcommunity administration will nearly double between 2001and 2015 (figure 2). Community participation in decisionmaking and implementation is considered essential forgood governance, equitable distribution of benefits, andsustainable resource management. Additionally, it isimportant for creating accountability and transparency. Using forests for poverty reduction requires a strong institutional framework and an effective legal and regula- tory environment, in which the rights of specific groupsamong the poor are recognized and protected (see note 1.3,Indigenous Peoples and Forests, and note 1.4, Property and Access Rights). Additionally, opportunities to develop sus-tainable forest businesses must be provided to the forest-dependent poor and other groups (see note 2.2, Small andMedium Enterprises). Therefore, development organiza- tions, in collaboration with government and other relevantstakeholders, need an approach that focuses on participa-tion and conflict resolution, and not just on the technicaland economic aspects of forestry. Coexistence of conservation and production. Conservation and production must coexist for the fullpotential of forests for poverty reduction to be realized.Although large areas of the world's forests must be preservedintact for their ecological and cultural values, much of what remains will inevitably be used for productive purposes. Consequently, a dual approach covering both protection andproductive use is needed. Greater investment in the development of plantations contributes to economic growth and poverty reductionwhile reducing pressure on natural forests and protectingsome ecosystem services. Integration of forest conservationinto productive landscapes can help achieve conservationobjectives, enhance the benefits of conservation, andbroaden the ownership of conservation initiatives (see note INTRODUCTION: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE FOREST SECTOR 30100200300400500600 1985 2001 Community owned Community administered2015 2015 2001 1985Million hectaresFigure 2 Community Ownership and Administration of Forests Source: White and Martin 2002.3.1, Mainstreaming Conservation Considerations into Pro- ductive Landscapes). Plantations, when coupled with pro-motion of environmentally and socially responsible trade in timber and forest products, have the potential to meet the rapidly growing demand of countries like China and Indiawithout sacrificing protected forest areas. Improved forest management practices. Although biodiversity and key environmental services have traditionally been sustained through the establishment ofprotected areas, the wide range of competing uses for forestsby diverse groups imposes constraints on how much can beachieved by protection alone. Improving forest management practices in production forests (forests where productive use is permitted) is an essential component of any strategy toprotect vital local environmental services, in addition toefforts aimed at bolstering the effectiveness of managementwithin protected areas. Innovative financing. It is highly unlikely that governments will be able to significantly scale down lumber extraction to preserve forests for their environmental services unless thecosts of forgone revenue can be offset in some way. Moreover,very few countries would be prepared to borrow funds\u2014fromthe World Bank or other sources\u2014to finance forest protection as a substitute for forest production. Innovative financingoptions and markets for forests' environmental services, suchas ecotourism, carbon offsets, reduced emissions fromdeforestation and degradation (REDD), and watershedmanagement, will all have important roles to play. As carboncredits grow in value under emerging global carbon tradingsystems, incentives to invest in the establishment of newforested areas for their carbon benefits, and in reduceddeforestation for reduced carbon emissions, will increase. Avoided deforestation. Though the Kyoto Protocol has no mechanism for providing compensation for reduced deforestation, the Stern Review highlights \"avoideddeforestation\" as a cost-effective mechanism to limitgreenhouse gas emissions (Stern 2007). Present concernsabout climate change have opened a window of opportunityfor the framework of avoided deforestation. The ForestCarbon Partnership Facility of the World Bank is developinga financing mechanism for avoided deforestation andpreparing countries to participate in this scheme.Preparations include, among other things, developingtechnical tools for monitoring and measuring avoideddeforestation, assessing opportunity costs, and making thenecessary financial transfers. Beyond the technical aspects ofoperationalizing this concept, an enabling environment must be created to facilitate this approach. Cross-sectoral impact. Deforestation is a complex phenomenon: While there is general agreement that it is strongly influenced by economic change arising fromoutside the forest sector itself, its specific causes (and,equally important, its economic and social effects) vary widely between\u2014and even within\u2014countries. Large-scaleeconomic change in any country, whether induced inspecific reform programs or inflicted through exogenousforces beyond the control of that country, has the potentialto bring about major changes in the condition of natural resources and the environment, especially in developing countries, where natural capital plays a significant role ineconomic growth and development and is crucial to thesustainability of these processes. Pressures on forests from poorly aligned strategies in agriculture, transportation, energy, and industry, as well asfrom unsound macroeconomic policies, are major causes offorest loss and degradation. Cross-sectoral cooperation tocoordinate policies is essential to avoid forest degradation,to ensure that forests are managed in a sustainable manner,and to harness opportunities created by ever-rising fossilfuel prices and improved biofuel technologies. THE WORLD BANK'S APPROACH TO THE FOREST SECTOR Forests are important to the World Bank's mission because of their contribution to the livelihoods of the poor, thepotential they offer for sustainable economic development, and the essential global environmental services they provide. The World Bank's 2002 Forests Strategy and Operational Policy In 2002 the World Bank adopted a revised Forests Strategy (World Bank 2004) and Operational Policy on Forests (OP4.36) that allow the World Bank to engage more proactively in the forest sector to help attain the goal of poverty reduc- tion without jeopardizing forests environmental and eco-nomic values intrinsic to sustainability. The strategy wasfounded on three equally important and interrelated pillars: Harnessing the potential of forests to reduce poverty in a sustainable manner Integrating forests more effectively into sustainabledevelopment 4 INTRODUCTION: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE FOREST SECTORProtecting vital local and global environmental services and values Addressing these three pillars together makes the Forests Strategy complex and multifaceted. It not only concerns growing or protecting trees but also involves a complexinteraction of policy, institutions, and incentives. The strat-egy embodies a multisectoral approach that addresses cross- sectoral issues and takes into account the impacts of activi-ties, policies, and practices outside the sector on forests andpeople who depend on forests for their livelihoods. The 2002 Forests Strategy and operational policy marked a shift from outright prohibition of World Bank financing of commercial logging operations in primary tropical moist forests to an approach of improved forest management withtargeted conservation of critical natural habitats in all typesof forests. The new approach embodies explicit safeguardsthat require World Bank-financed investment operations tocomply with independent certification standards acceptableto the World Bank. Harnessing the potential of forests to reduce poverty . Forest outcomes are crucial for poverty reduction in many of the World Bank's client countries. For bothcountries with large forest endowments, and for others with limited forests, if forest issues are not fully incorporated intobroad national government and assistance strategies, theoverarching goals of poverty reduction will not be met. T o harness the potential of forests to reduce poverty, con- ditions must be created to ensure that the rural poor areable to manage their natural resources, especially the forests,for their own benefit. Capacity must be built to support andregulate community use of forests and plantations. Forestassets under various forms of community management,possibly supported by the private sector, could becomemajor sources for global environmental services, such asbiodiversity and carbon sequestration. Integrating forests into sustainable economic development. Forests are one of the most mismanaged resources in many countries. Forests are seriouslyundervalued, many of their environmental benefits do notenter markets, and poor governance has fueled illegalactivities. The rapid rates of deforestation in the last decadesare largely a result of the spillover from poor policies in othersectors and lack of governance in the forest sector itself. A main task, therefore, is to help governments improve policy, economic management, and governance in the forestsector, including forest concessions policies and allocations.Efforts to bring about credible systems for socially, ecologi- cally, and economically sound management of productionforests should, however, also be coupled with systems for independent certification and monitoring. Identification and promotion of local, regional, and global markets forforest products is a matching priority. Protecting global forest values. More than 600 million hectares of protected areas have been established in developing countries. While many of these areas areeconomically inaccessible, other areas are under increasingpressure from development and illegal activities, includinglogging and poaching. Many governments do not have the resources to effectively administer and protect these areas. In addition, other forests, ecologically sensitive and rich inbiodiversity but outside protected areas, are underincreasing threat. Invasive pressures are likely to worsen unless significant additional funds can be made available from multiplesources, at highly concessional or grant terms, for protection,or unless effective markets for the ecosystem values of forestscan be developed. The creation of new markets for the envi-ronmental services of forests, such as biodiversity, carbonsequestration, and watershed protection, are essential. The Forests Strategy course for implementation The World Bank's Forests Strategy charts a course for imple- mentation based on engaging in key countries, creatingpartnerships, increasing analytical work, and improving coordination across the World Bank Group. 2In line with this, the World Bank is pursuing the following: Selectively engaging with forest priority countries. Developing partnerships, such as the Global Forest Part- nership, that bring together existing and emerging part-nership arrangements\u2014such as the World Bank-World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Alliance, the Program on Forests (PROFOR), and Forest Law Enforcement and Gover-nance (FLEG) initiatives\u2014and that enhance coordinationamong client countries, donors, international nongovern-mental organizations, research institutions, and civil soci- ety to achieve the goals of the Forests Strategy. In thefuture, the strategy will continue to rely on successfulefforts and enter into new partnerships as dictated by thestrategy and the changing development context.

Building a solid analytical foundation to support andfacilitate engagement in the forest sector. Coordinating across the World Bank Group, with a par-ticular emphasis on the International Finance Corpora-tion (IFC), whose operations in the sector are significant in many forest-important countries. Operational policies for World Bank-supported investment projects The World Bank's suite of operational policies ensures that Bank operations with potential impact on forests take forestoutcomes into consideration. In line with the current Forests Strategy, OP 4.36 is proactive both in identifying and pro- tecting critical forest conservation areas and in supportingimproved forest management in production forests outsidethese areas. OP 4.36 applies to all World Bank investmentoperations that potentially affect forests, regardless of whether they are specific forest sector investments. It alsoencourages the incorporation of forest issues in CountryAssistance Strategies (CAS) and addresses cross-sectoralimpacts on forests. OP 4.36 provides for conservation of crit-ical natural habitats and prohibits World Bank financing of any commercial harvesting or plantation development in critical natural habitats. It also allows for proactive invest-ment support to improve forest management outside criticalforest areas, with explicit safeguards to ensure that suchWorld Bank-financed operations comply with independentcertification standards acceptable to the World Bank, oroperations with an agreed upon, time-bound action plan toestablish compliance with these standards. Beyond OP 4.36, relevant operational policies comprise the provisions for environmental assessment embodied in OP4.01, which require that impacts of any proposed activity onthe natural environment, human health and safety, and social aspects be taken into account under OPs 4.10 (IndigenousPeoples), 4.11 (Physical Cultural Resources), 4.12 (Involun-tary Resettlement), and 4.04 (Natural Habitats). OP 4.04 inparticular requires that the World Bank not support projectsthat, in its opinion, involve the significant conversion ordegradation of critical natural habitats, and OP 4.10 requiresthat the World Bank only support projects in which affectedIndigenous Peoples provide broad community support to theproject based on prior, free, and informed consultations. Broadly based development policy lending, by its nature, is not dealt with under safeguard policies of the type the 6 INTRODUCTION: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE FOREST SECTORWorld Bank applies to its investment lending. Development policy loans (DPLs) were originally designed to provide sup-port for macroeconomic policy reforms, such as in trade pol- icy and agriculture. Over time, DPLs have evolved to focus more on structural, financial sector, and social policyreforms, and on improving public sector resource manage-ment. Development policy operations now generally aim topromote competitive market structures, correct distortions in incentive regimes, establish appropriate financial moni-toring and safeguards, create an environment conducive toprivate sector investment, encourage private sector activity,promote good governance, and mitigate short-term adverseeffects of development policy. While the sorts of activities, institutional changes, and policy developments that result can certainly have impacts on forests, it is no simple task toassess what these effects will be in any given situation, as theconnections with outcomes at the field level are diffuse andindirect\u2014and thus quite inaccessible to the precise and spe-cific requirements of the safeguard policies that apply toinvestment lending. The World Bank recognized this diffi-culty, and until recently did not subject its structural adjust-ment lending to compliance with the safeguard policies. Anoperational directive (OD 8.60) provided some guidance onenvironmental issues for this form of lending until it wasreplaced by a more detailed operational policy on DPLs (OP 8.60). 3This policy makes explicit mention of forests and is highly relevant to the forest sector because it guides the due diligence needed to ensure that the potential for this form of lending to cause damage to natural resources, forests, and the environment is minimized in the design and approach used.Such operations are of special concern where large numbersof poor people rely on forests to some extent for their liveli-hoods. Where rapid economic change is occurring, perverse incentives and misallocation of resources leading to forestremoval or changes in the status of use and ownership offorests will be risk factors to poverty alleviation. THE WORLD BANK'S LENDING TO THE SECTOR The portfolio of the World Bank's investments in forests indicates an upward trend, after having fallen in the early2000s to historically low levels. 4The total commitment in 2001 was US$141 million, reflecting lending from the WorldBank, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and the IFC (figure 3). Lending has remained relatively steady in fiscal 2007 (July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007). 5Between October 2002 and June 2007, the World Bank approved 12 stand-alone forestry projects, as well as 39 others that include forestry components. There are 13 more forestry-related projects inthe pipeline, four of which are stand-alone forestry projects. A more proactive approach to World Bank engagement inforests, which is embodied in the Forests Strategy, and strong support for this approach from the Board of Execu- tive Directors and senior management have been significantfactors in creating the increase in activities. Overall lending profile The volume of lending for the five years preceding the Forests Strategy is nearly equivalent to the five years afterintroduction of the Forests Strategy: US$568 million between fiscal 1997 and fiscal 2001, compared with US$517 million from fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2006. After adoptionof the Forests Strategy, lending slowed and has only recentlyregained the levels preceding the adoption. When forestryinvestments in projects associated with other sectors are included (that is, World Bank projects that do not have aforest sector coding), aggregate IBRD and IDA investmentin the forest sector is much larger (figure 4). By this mea-sure, total investment in forests by the World Bank wasUS$770 million after adoption (fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2006). Though lending in the forestry sector has not expanded since approval of the Forests Strategy in 2002, forest lendinghas been integrated into natural resource management,agriculture, environment, and rural development projects.Furthermore, World Bank lending has expanded to includeall types of forests, not just tropical forests: Nearly 40 per-cent of lending between fiscal 02 and fiscal 06 (US$204 mil-lion) has been in nontropical countries, predominantly in Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean. Regional lending profile The regional profile of lending has changed since 2001 (figure 5). The inclusion of temperate forests in the Forests Strategyhas increased lending in the Europe and Central Asia region. In the region, the World Bank has been concentrating on an increasing demand for policy dialogue and advisory technicalassistance. Projects in Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,Georgia, Kazakhstan, Romania, and the Russian Federationare working to strengthen fire management, reforestation, and development of protected areas. Focus within the proj-ects has been on training, institutional reforms, forest infor-mation, the role of the private sector, and devolution of man-agement to local and subnational levels. In the Sub-Saharan Africa region (AFR) since the new strategy there have been three active projects with a focus ongovernance in the Congo Basin (Cameroon, DemocraticRepublic of Congo, and Gabon). It is anticipated that overthe next few years, forest activities will focus on governance-related issues, sector reform, and institution strengthening. In general, the World Bank has had limited forestry engagement in the Middle East and North Africa region INTRODUCTION: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE FOREST SECTOR 72001 2002 2003 2004 Fiscal year200511254582128 35111274 166 645217 500400 300 200100 0World Bank Global Environment Facility International Finance Corporation Total US$ millionFigure 3 Commitment from the World Bank, GEF , and the IFC for Forests, FY01 to FY07 (MENA) because of its low forest cover. In Morocco, a nation with relatively extensive forests, the World Bank isinvolved in preparing an Integrated Forest Development Project. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, a land and water management project has a community-based forest man-agement component. In the East Asia and the Pacific region (EAP), the World Bank's lending has focused on plantation development in countries, such as China, that are major consumers of forestraw materials. 6Additional focus has been on policy dialogue for development of certification schemes. Also, successful projects in Vietnam and the Lao People's DemocraticRepublic are working to address governance and policy reforms. In the South Asia region (SAR), India accounts for the bulk of lending. Lending commitments have been declining since 2003 as one generation of projects has ended (figure 5). Sincethen, lending awaits the results of an Analytical and AdvisoryServices (AAA) initiative designed to guide future lending andto reengage dialogue with the government about policy. 7 In the Latin America and the Caribbean region (LAC), projects have concentrated on community forestry, refor- estation, forest land restoration, forest certification, forest concessions, policy, and legal reforms.8Additional projects 8 INTRODUCTION: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE FOREST SECTORFigure 4 IBRD/IDA and GEF Forestry-Related Lending, Including Forest Components in Nonforest Projects, 1997-2006 Figure 5 Amount of IBRD/IDA Forestry 2005 2006450 400350 and yearsSSA ECA LAC MENA SAR020406080100120 2001 2002 2003 2004 20052001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2001 2002 2003 20042005 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005US$ millionsin Belize, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Sal- vador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Peru concern the creationand management of protected areas with an emphasis on indigenous and local community participation and forest management. See figure 6 for a regional breakdown of lending over 2001-05. PROGRESS TO DATE In 2006 the World Bank commissioned an independent midterm review of the Forests Strategy implementation(Contreras-Hermosilla and Simula 2007). The review found that the World Bank has made substantial progress on all fronts outlined in the strategy. Y et the strategy has been onlypartially implemented in the four years since its adoption.Some of its main achievements follow. Mainstreaming of the strategy. The World Bank has sought to manage the effects of macroeconomic policy and sector programs on forest resources. Some countries haveincorporated forest sector reforms into their PovertyReduction Strategy Papers (PRSP). The Bank has supported these within the framework of CAS in countries like Cameroon, and through forest investment projects in suchcountries as Albania, Croatia, Romania, and Russia. TheWorld Bank has also supported policy changes through DPLs,again for example, in Cameroon. In many other countries,however, forests have not been properly considered in theCAS or DPL, even in cases where doing so was clearlywarranted by the size of the sector or its potential to alleviatepoverty, contribute to economic development, and preserve environmental values. Governments do not always makeforestry a policy priority or seek Bank support, and in someinstances analytical work that might have provided a framework for integrating forest issues into planning andpolicy making has been lacking or insufficient. The relatedanalytical work has been highly variable and offersopportunity for improvement. Successful extension to nontropical forests has extended its engagement to nontropical forests, including those in China, Georgia, Romania, the Russian Federation,and Turkey. It has also supported timber productionactivities in tropical moist forests in countries such asCambodia, Cameroon, and Mexico. The integration offorest components into natural-resource and ruraldevelopment programs has intensified in countries likeAlbania, Gabon, and Guatemala. The World Bank has alsobroadened its focus on forestry with new instruments, suchas independent certification. It has also expanded the scopeof its interventions to account for the impacts on forests ofpolicies in other sectors, such as trade. Despite these accomplishments, the World Bank's overall level of engagement has thus far remained insufficient for achieving the targets set in the Forests Strategy. IBRD andIDA lending volumes increased only slowly, regaining andthen stabilizing at levels comparable to volumes before the adoption of the strategy. Overall World Bank involvementin natural tropical forests operations remains modest and isoften surrounded by intense controversy. In many cases therelative dearth of self-standing forest projects reflects the lack of priority that clients assign to investing in forests orto introducing forest sector reforms. Poverty reduction. Poverty reduction objectives, a pillar of the strategy as well as fundamental to the World Bank's overall mission, have been appropriately included in forestinvestments in a number of countries, including Albania,Gabon, and Nicaragua. In many other countries, however,poverty and the effects of forest interventions on forest-dependent people have not received adequate attention, either in the World Bank's analytical work or in its lending program. Other key achievements include the following: Strengthening forest sector governance and transparency. World Bank activities have created a political climate forhigh-level regional discussions on improvement in gov- INTRODUCTION: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE 26% of IBRD/IDA Lending, 2001-05ernance and increased transparency and accountability in the sector. They have also made improving forest sec-tor governance and institutional reform a central focus in many countries, including Cambodia, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Honduras,Indonesia, and Russia, and initiated the process of sectorreform in some of these countries (Democratic Republicof Congo, Gabon, and Tanzania). Conserving local and global ecosystem services. The World Bank has supported and spearheaded the development of conservation through payments for environmental services schemes and improved management of pro- tected areas through Bank projects. The World Bank alsorecently launched the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility(FCPF) to enable payments for REDD. Facilitating responsible private investment. Most World Bank client country governments are working to attract responsible domestic and foreign private sector invest- ments to achieve effective conservation and sustainable management of forest resources. Building strategic partnerships. Through strategic part- nerships and programs, such as the World Bank-WWF Alliance, PROFOR, and FLEG initiatives, the World Bank has been leveraging resources, aligning stakeholder interests, enabling innovation, improving outreach, andscaling up impacts. The World Bank has been activelysupporting strategic partnerships at regional (for exam-ple, Congo Basin Forest Partnership) and national lev- els. The World Bank is currently facilitating the develop-ment of a Global Forest Partnership to galvanizesynergies among forest partnerships and programs andto scale up the availability of grants for the developmentof the sector. THE CHALLENGE AHEAD The 2002 Forests Strategy emphasized a path of \"cautious reengagement.\" Since fiscal 2002, this has included theWorld Bank selectively reengaging in key countries, building a solid analytical foundation for World Bank lending and grants, using partnerships to initiate and implementnational and international processes for strengthening gov-ernance, enhancing poverty considerations in forest activi-ties, and advancing forest conservation and sustainable for- est management. Progress made in these areas since the startof the new strategy is described above. Still, significant gapsand challenges remain, not only across countries andregions, but also in implementation of the World Bank'spriority areas. These challenges are as follows.Key global challenges Address poverty and forest governance by promoting forest ownership and access rights. Promote greater recognition of the rights of local and indigenous groups and give greater attention to land tenure, ownership, and rights- to-resource and access issues. Emphasize and enablestakeholder participation in the formulation andimplementation of policies, strategies, and programs to fosterownership and long-term sustainability of the resource. Enhance the role of forests as an engine of economic growth and development. Increase investments in plantations (especially in tropical countries),expand forest certification and overall forest management,and encourage responsible private sector investments,including for community-company partnerships for on-siteforest enterprise development, and for market access. Protect vital local and global environmental services and values. Create markets for local ecosystem services, such as water and soil erosion. Seize the potentiallyenormous financing opportunities emerging in the contextof global climate change to increase investments for carbonsequestration and avoided deforestation to reduceemissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Assist countries to integrate the global forest agenda into their own national strategies and policies and toharness the development opportunities available. Use the World Bank's leadership position in the global forestdialogue and take advantage of emerging economic andenvironmental opportunities (such as the attractiveness ofbiofuels, for example) to foster sustainable forest management.Integrate forest interdependencies into the design ofagriculture, rural development, and natural resourcemanagement projects to ensure sustainable economic growthand rural poverty alleviation. Key regional challenges Sub-Saharan Africa. Continue promoting fundamental sector reforms and capacity building around the challenges of governance, environmental protection, and forest livelihoods. Expand market mechanisms to secure environmental services, and improve dry forests management. East Asia and the Pacific. Invest in plantation area expansion, expand instruments for natural forest 10 INTRODUCTION: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE FOREST SECTORmanagement and biodiversity conservation, provide support to forest law enforcement and governanceinitiatives, and maintain well-managed environmental and social safeguard reviews. Europe and Central Asia. Support transformation of forest management organizations into efficient service delivery institutions capable of meeting the challenges of multifunctional, landscape-level forest management;support decentralization of management to subnationalentities through adequate public financing mechanisms andincreased responsibilities for the private sector and localcommunities. Latin America and the Caribbean. Support improved forest governance and institutions, sustainable harvesting and forest management, forest landscape restoration, anddevelopment of industrial plantations. Middle East and North Africa. Enhance policy and institutional reforms to position forests in a wider context of sustainable natural resource management. South Asia. Support the rural poor through greater access to forest resources and stronger property rights, and foster greater participation of the private sector in productiveenterprises in rural areas, for local value addition andemployment. Key challenges for the World Bank Mainstream forests. Strengthen forests' role in the World Bank's agenda through greater inclusion of forest sector issues in PRSPs and CASs and better alignment of Poverty Reduction Support Credits and GEF and IFC resources with the overall lending program to address poverty andlivelihood issues. Implement safeguards and due diligence. Ensure efficacious application of the World Bank's safeguards policies (especially on the social side) in traditional forestlending projects, and strengthening due diligence for forestconcerns in DPL, through increased participation, betterknowledge management and communication, and focused staff training. Strengthen forest governance. Integrate forest governance into World Bank policy dialogue and projects to achieve concrete outcomes in client countries. PURPOSE OF THE FORESTS SOURCEBOOK The purpose of the Forests Sourcebook is to be a resource for World Bank clients, task managers, and other stakeholders in the design and implementation of projects in line with the Forests Strategy as they tackle the challenges ahead. The sourcebook draws on experiences from within and outsidethe World Bank in implementing innovative approaches forintegrating the three pillars of the strategy. The sourcebookdistills key points from frontier guidance material sup- ported or published in specific subject areas, either by theWorld Bank or other partner organizations. The sourcebook offers guidance to program and project managers by (i) highlighting the key issues in each chapter,(ii) suggesting approaches for implementing projects and analytical work in line with the strategy, (iii) providing links to more in-depth sources of information, and, where possibleand relevant, (iv) describing tools for addressing these issues. NOTES 1. In 2002, the World Bank estimated that total forest sector private investment in developing countries and countries in transition was in the range of US$8 billion to US$10 billion per year. In the opinion of the review team for the World Bank's independent midterm review of the Forests Strategyimplementation, the 2007 figure is substantially higher(Contreras-Hermosilla and Simula (2007)). According to theFAO (2006), the plantation area in developing countries is increasing at about 1.8 million hectares per year. This repre-sents investments of US$3 billion to US$4 billion per year.Improvements in existing forest management should beadded to this, but reliable estimates do not exist. In planta-tion-based projects, industrial investments represent 80-90percent of the total. Applying this coefficient\u2014with planta- tion investments being 20 percent of the total\u2014total forest investment in developing countries should be at least US$15billion. 2. Successful implementation requires (i) being selective in World Bank activities in forests with country ownership andcommitment, as broad criteria for engagement; (ii) devel-oping partnerships (with other donors, nongovernmentalorganizations, and the private sector) to enable the WorldBank to address forest issues through a broad spectrum ofpolicies and in collaboration with national governments;(iii) financing the strategy by encouraging blended financ-ing arrangements through multiple sources, including thedevelopment of markets and financial payments for envi-ronmental services from forests; (iv) increasing economic and sector work to initiate the process of building analysis,awareness, and then demand for forest investments (and forincorporation of forestry issues) into CASs and PRSPs; and INTRODUCTION: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE FOREST SECTOR 11(v) coordinating across the Bank, including with Interna- tional Finance Corporation (IFC), Multilateral InvestmentGuarantee Agency (MIGA), and World Bank Institute (WBI) for better implementation of a unified strategy. 3.

The World Bank Group includes the International Development Association (IDA), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), InternationalCentre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), IFC,and MIGA. Aggregate investment in the forest sector tendsto fluctuate from year to year because it can be heavilyskewed by one or two large projects. Such fluctuationswould be less if aggregate disbursements were tracked. 5. This sourcebook does not go into details, but the Global Environment Facility (GEF) is an important partner in theimplementation of the Forests Strategy. In 2003-05, theGEF provided US$186.1 million for 38 forest-related proj-ects implemented by the World Bank. The total value ofthese projects was US$951.8 million. The number of WorldBank-implemented GEF projects has averaged 13 per yearsince 2000. The average size of these projects has doubledduring the same period, from US$16.1 million to US$34.4million. 6.

It includes a policy report, policy dia- logue, and comprehensive dissemination that will guidefuture World Bank lending in forestry. It is the basis for dis- cussions with the government of India on possible reformsat the national and state levels. Important outcomes have been the formation of a forestry donor's forum, and high- level policy meetings with the Prime Minister's Office andthe National Planning Commission. 8. These subjects have been the focus of Bank projects in Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Peru. REFERENCES CITED Contreras-Hermosilla, A., and M.

Adetailed overview of poverty concepts is provided in the World Bank's World Development Report on Attacking Poverty (World Bank 2001). This reportstates that poverty is not solely about material dep-rivation, but is also related to broader notions ofrisk, vulnerability, social inclusion, and opportuni- ties. Poverty encompasses all forms of deprivationthat prevent a person from achieving his or heraspirations. This broader definition of poverty has policy implications because it underscores the positiveinteractions of interventions in a broad set of wel- fare dimensions. In practice, it implies that the nature of the problem must influence selection ofthe appropriate welfare measure.Box 1.1 What Do We Mean by Poverty? Source: Authors' compilation from World Bank 2001. The majority of the world's poor are concentrated in rural areas and, consequently, depend on naturalresources, over which they exercise little control, for their livelihoods. It is estimated that 60 million Indige- nous Peoples are totally dependent on forests, 350 millionpeople are highly forest dependent, and 1.2 billion aredependent on agroforestry. The scale and significance ofpoverty issues on forest lands demand that poverty allevia- tion efforts give special attention to forest areas and the peo-ple living in them. Poor rural families depend heavily on \"wild\" resources; in both forest-poor and forest-rich contexts, forest productsare used for fuel, food, medicines, construction materials, fertilizers, and cash. Reliance on these resources often increases in times of personal, family, or social hardship,with these wild resources being especially important forwomen, children, and ethnic minorities. In many cases, aspeople get richer, they use and sell fewer of the forest prod-ucts that are considered inferior goods. However, most peo-ple in Sub-Saharan Africa have not gotten richer, resultingin growing markets for all forest products as populationsand urbanization increase. A similar situation is found inthe poorer regions of Asia. (See box 1.1.) Smallholders living in forest margins in diverse parts of the world earn 10-25 percent of their household incomes from nontimber forest products, many of which are eitherundervalued or omitted completely from conventional eco-nomic income statistics (see Note 1.1, Mainstreaming theRole of Forests in Poverty Alleviation; Ndoye, Ruiz P\u00e9rez, 15Forests for Poverty ReductionCHAPTER 1 and Eyebe 1999). Studies of income from indigenous natu- ral resource management and small-scale local forest enter-prises in a number of countries in Africa, and joint forest management in Madhya Pradesh state in India, are but a few of the studies showing the significant impacts of these activ-ities on the income of poor people (see Monela et al. 2004;Angelsen and Wunder 2003; and Mallik 2000 as cited in Scherr, White, and Kaimowitz 2004). A meta-review of 54case studies that examined income from forest products in rural areas of developing countries found that forest income (ranging from US$0 to US$3,458 and averaging US$678 peryear, once adjusted for purchasing power parity) made upone-fifth of household income of the population sampledfor the report (Vedeld and others 2004). Wild food, fodder for animals, and fuelwood were the most important prod-ucts and accounted for approximately 70 percent of forestincome. Household forest income increased with increaseddistance from markets, suggesting that forests are importantfor communities with limited alternative income opportu- nities. In some cases, forest environmental income had a strong and significant equalizing effect on local income dis-tribution (Vedeld and others 2004). It is also estimated that globally 17.4 million people (full- time equivalents) earn their livings from formal sector forest-based employment (that is, enterprises with more than 20employees) in forestry, wood industries, furniture, and pulpand paper (Poschen and Lougren 2001, as cited in Scherr,White, Kaimowitz 2004). Poschen Lougren estimatethat an additional 30-35 million are employed\u2014most ofthem in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia\u2014in theinformal and subsistence forest-based sectors. Types of reliance on forests. Forest uses by local populations change through the transition from hunting and gathering to sedentary agriculture, and vary withhouseholds' socioeconomic levels. Across this spectrum,forests tend to become less dense and forest cover decreasesin association with growing population densities and highermarket demands, and in association with changing types offorest use. There are, of course, exceptions to this trend. Often, the proportion of overall household income from certain forest products tends to decline as households movefrom hunting and gathering to sedentary cultivation. This isa reflection of more than just increased income opportuni-ties in agriculture and other domains; it is also indicative ofthe decreased availability of types of forest resources thatwere previously abundant. In other cases, the proportion ofa household's income from the forest can continue to besubstantial when combined with agricultural activities, evendespite a decrease in high-value timber stocks in the region:a seven-year study in the Brazilian state of Amap\u00e1 showedthat when sawtimber, poles, and firewood are produced in amanagement system that combines forestry and agriculture,they can provide significant additional income for Amazon-ian smallholders (Pinedo-Vasquez et al. 2001).The growing importance of nonfarm rural activities as a source of rural household income, and the significant share of the nonfarm total accounted for by forest product activi- ties, make this one of the most important vehicles through which the forest sector can contribute to poverty alleviation.As sources of income, commercial forest product activitieshave, in principle, the potential to help households move outof poverty. However, as labor costs increase, many of these low-value, labor-intensive activities are abandoned. Othercommercial products cease to be used as incomes increasebecause they are \"inferior goods\" for which there are readysubstitutes, lowering their overall marketability. This gener-ally shifts forest use to more valuable forest products and activities that gradually require more and more skill and cap- ital inputs. Thus, dependence on different forest productswill likely vary with socioeconomic levels: a dependence onlow-valued activities will decrease as poverty is lessened andhouseholds move out of poverty, in favor of higher-valuedactivities with greater returns. Forests in rural poor's asset portfolio. Natural assets, such as forests, are of particular importance to the poor, partly because of their lack of access to financial and physicalcapital and formal forms of human capital, such aseducation. As portfolio managers, the poor draw down some forms of capital to convert to other forms; commonly, forexample, the poor temporarily draw down stocks of naturalcapital (for example, harvesting fuelwood for sale) to investin their portfolio, recognizing the fungibility of assets.Insistence on an unchanging \"steady state\" forest reserveunderplays forest dynamics and can limit the options opento the poor. A flexible, comprehensive, and dynamic view ofnatural assets and the whole portfolio is needed. Forestproducts and outputs fulfill d ifferent functions for people at different socioeconomic levels, and multiple goals andstrategies may be needed to reach different groups, eventhose depending on the same forest. Linkages between forest-based poverty alleviation and rural livelihoods. Forest-based poverty alleviation cannot be isolated from other aspects of livelihoods. The majority of thosewho can benefit from forest products live outside forests; theylive in predominantly agricultural landscapes, and for many ofthem the forest products they use come as much from the farmas the forest. Reflecting this, forest-based poverty alleviation hasto be linked to other land uses, such as agriculture, grazing, andagroforestry systems. On-farm tree-growing schemes have hadlimited success so far; thus, new strategies of integratingmultiple land uses must be explored. 16 CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTIONA summary of the salient features of linkages between forests and livelihoods and how they have been changing are provided in table 1.1. Forests provide a tremendous source of natural capital that can be used to alleviate poverty in two ways. The first is poverty avoidance or mitigation, in which forest resourcesserve as a safety net or fill gaps by providing a source ofpetty cash. For example, the Tawahka of Krausirpi in Hon- duras cope with short-term and personal shocks (for exam-ple, a poor bean harvest or a sick child) through the sale offorest products. The same community uses forest productsales (for example, bushmeat) to cope with covariate shocks,such as the rapid decline in cocoa markets following a drop in cocoa prices. The use of forests as natural insurance is important for forest dwellers because their livelihoods arecharacterized by unusually high levels of environmental, agricultural, epidemiological, and market uncertainty.Moreover, the remote location of most forest dwellers implies limited access to more conventional forms of insur- ance, including formal credit and insurance programs. The second is poverty elimination, in which forest resources help to lift the household out of poverty by func-tioning as a source of savings, investment, accumulation, asset building, and permanent increases in income and wel-fare. As a source of income, forests can provide a decent liv-ing when markets are accessible, especially if a household isinvolved in the planting, harvesting, processing, transport-ing, and trading of forest products. These households are usually involved in varying degrees of forest management because such income from forests is seldom obtained by CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTION 17Table 1.1 Changing Linkages between Forests and Poverty Characteristics of livelihood inputs from forests Impacts of change on forest livelihood inputs Subsistence and cultural importance Forests form an integral part of the social and cultural Likely to weaken, but persists widely in some aspects (e.g., medicinal ). framework for forest dwellers.

Another rationale for prioritizing poverty reduction through forests is the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Countries that have adopted these goals have set atarget of halving global poverty by 2015, and for institutionssuch as the World Bank, reducing global poverty is the mainchallenge. While economic growth appears to be the means to lift the poor out of extreme poverty in the developingworld, the capacity of the poor to participate in economicgrowth must be enhanced if they are to share in its benefits. PAST ACTIVITIES Between 2002 and 2005, 28 World Bank forestry projects had components focused on poverty reduction. Povertyalleviation activities include d in the project portfolio varied from strengthening of land tenure rights, reform of policies and discrimination against the poor and Indigenous Peo-ples, development of community fuelwood plantations,increased productivity of pastures and forest lands, erosioncontrol, and training in ecotourism, to promotion of fuel- efficient technologies for households. Investments in theseprojects were approximately US$130 million. See boxes 1.2and 1.3 for successful examples. The design of poverty reduction activities in forest proj- ects tends to be difficult, and mixed results ensue because of the complexity of the issues involved. Of a set of 40 projectsthat were examined for the \"World Bank Forest Strategy: Review of Implementation\" (Contreras-Hermosilla andSimula 2007), it was found that 16 contained activities thatwere highly relevant to poverty alleviation, while 12 hadactivities that were substantially relevant. Eight other proj-ects were moderately relevant in their consideration offorests and poverty alleviation; in three projects the consid-eration was negligible. KEY ISSUES Donor engagement in forestry with a direct or indirect aim of alleviating poverty concentrates mainly in three areas: Increasing local users' participation in forest manage-ment to make management more responsive to theirneeds, and to increase benefits flowing to them Supporting management strategies that include growingtrees on farms Exploiting income-generating opportunities from pro-duction and trade in forest products in the nonfarmrural economy Activities in these areas have had mixed results. Much donor attention has been placed on local participation\u2014 often resulting in false perceptions of participation ratherthan true participation. Tree-growing schemes have resulted in little additional planting taking place, in some cases 18 CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTIONThis watershed rehabilitation project included activi- ties in the forest sector among its several project com-ponents. More than 1 million farmers in the project area directly benefited from the project, with annual grain output raised from 427,000 tons to 698,600 tonsand fruit production from 80,000 tons to 345,000tons. Farmers' annual incomes per capita alsoincreased from 360 Chinese yuan to 1,263 Chinese yuan (about US$43 to US$152). The various project components contributed to the significant reduction of poverty and tripling of netincomes by addressing a range of short-, medium-, andlong-term income-generating and income-stabilizingmeasures. The project supported diversification ofproduction to reduce variability in income. For exam- ple, trees were used to provide an income buffer duringdifficult times. Large tracts of land in the project area were severely degraded and past agricultural practices were clearly unsustainable as a result of uncontrolled grazing, fuel-wood gathering, and cropping on slopes that were toosteep for sustainable farming. The project succeeded in taking a large proportion of these areas entirely out ofproduction for natural regeneration and in plantingtrees and shrubs on unstable slopes to protect soils andprovide sustainable returns. This practice securedlong-term productivity of those areas and raisedincomes for the local people.Box 1.2 The Role of Forests in Benefiting the Rural Poor: An Example from the World Bank's China Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project Source: World Bank Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project (P003540).

Activities focused on processing andtrade often proved to be susceptible to changes in market requirements, to domination by intermediaries, and to shifts to domesticated or synthetic sources of supply, and fewproved to be sustainable. Considerable room remains forimproving the contribution of forests to poverty alleviation. Improved performance framework for forest interventions. An improved performance framework is necessary to enhance pro-poor benefits. A clear understandingof what forestry can and cannot do to alleviate poverty isessential to enhancing effectiveness of poverty-related interventions at all levels within the forest sector. T o give greater emphasis to poverty alleviation within forestry, it is necessaryto acknowledge that the greater part of the rural populationsthat benefit from forest products are located outside forests asnormally defined. Thus, forestry interventions need toencompass all tree stocks and activities based on them tocontribute significantly to poverty alleviation, rather than beconfined to forests and forest-dwelling households. Forestsector interventions also need to recognize the different wealthlevels among rural poor households and need to beappropriately structured to target the population of concern(see note 1.3, Indigenous Peoples and Forests). Harmonization of activities with other sectors. Harmonizing poverty alleviation activities in the forestsector with what is happening in other sectors is equallyimportant. This harmonization requires recognizing and considering the implications of broader changes, such asmarket liberalization and structural adjustment for rural development (additional discussion on this is found in chapter 6, Mainstreaming Forests into Development Policyand Planning: Assessing Cross-Sectoral Impacts). Transparency and accountability in governance. Transparent and accountable governance is critical tofostering pro-poor growth and essential to ensuring thatthis natural resource wealth is managed wisely (see chapter5, Improving Forest Governance). A pro-poor growthstrategy for rural areas must build on natural resources and facilitate management of these resources for the long term to provide the fuel for economic development to relievepoverty. It also must grant secure and equitable access toassets\u2014which requires developm ent of property rights (see note 1.4, Property and Access Rights) and efficient landadministration. Property rights and land administration. Allocation of property rights and efficient land administration are critical to pro-poor growth in rural areas. The process ofdeveloping statutory property rights influences the pro-poorpotential of forest activities (see note 1.4, Property and Access Rights, and note 1.3, Indigenous Peoples and Forests).Customary rights over forest resources often exist, and wherethese are codified and made statutory, they are seldom causesfor conflict. However, in areas where customary systems of CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTION 19Direct short-term poverty alleviation impacts were substantial in this project, which financed approxi-mately 5,000 person-years of local villager employ- ment to implement many field interventions. The budgets of households participating in project activi-ties increased by an estimated 30 percent annually. The quality and productivity of forest and pasture land managed under the new plans by the newly cre- ated resource user associations improved to such anextent that commune families quickly began derivingincome from forest and pastures (including fuelwood,fodder, nontimber forest products, some grazing, andthe like) that had been seriously degraded bush beforeproject-supported investments. Of significance is evidence that some communeand family investments in resource management (for example, active protection of areas from grazing, fenc-ing, tree planting, and erosion control intervention) continued even after project support ceased, indicat- ing that the shift to improved land-use practicebrought about by the project is likely to be sustainable.This unexpected level of success led to identificationof the need for the Albanian government to further develop its skills and capacity to provide communeswith silvicultural and other technical guidance thatwill be necessary as their forests mature, and toapproach the World Bank with a request for a follow-up project that would scale up and expand the cover-age of communal forest and pasture management throughout the country.Box 1.3 Forests for Poverty Alleviation: World Bank Albania Forestry Project Source: World Bank Albania Forestry Project (P008271). Board approval: April 16, 1996; closed: June 30, 2004.forest management and ownership have been disregarded or overruled, many local communities, poor households, andwomen have lost access to forest resources. In these cases, government policies have awarded favored groups concessions, licenses, and permits, limiting (or in some casesdenying) the rights of poor local inhabitants. This is evidentin places where creation of government forest reserves andprotected areas have reduced households' access to common property resources. The need of the poor for continuedaccess to a common pool biomass resource to sustainpredominantly subsistence-based coping strategies can alsoincreasingly conflict with the interests of better-offhouseholds and outsiders (Arnold 2001). The transition to pro-poor forest tenure and property rights occurs through a combination of strategies\u2014bothreforms fostered by political elites and reforms demandedby civil society and community organizations. These effortsshould, to the extent possible, move beyond transferringlimited rights to forest resources to communities. For exam-ple, in India participatory forestry is restricted to degradedor poorer areas of forests, and there are widespread restric-tions regarding rights over timber and other commerciallyvaluable forest products. Potential of community-based forest management. Community-Based Forest Management (CBFM) offers avehicle for reducing poverty among forest-dependenthouseholds (see note 1.2, Community-Based ForestManagement, and note 1.3, Indigenous Peoples and Forests).Commonly, forest-dependent people who live in or nearforests tend to be politically weak or powerless. Formallyrecognized forms of CBFM can empower these householdsand individuals through recognition of their rights tosustainably manage, control, use, and benefit from forestresources. CBFM can also offer a competitive advantage forunorganized producers through economies of scale.Community engagement in forest management has beenincreasing as forest sector policy reforms give greater weightto participation of communities in forest management.Examples of CBFM are found in joint forest management,participatory forest management, community forestry, andother similar schemes in numerous Bank client countries.The performance of CBFM initiatives has been mixed,revealing the importance of the political, institutional,governance, and capacity elements in such initiatives. Thereare, however, several successful examples of communitiesthat organized and thus gained financially and politically(for example, Mexico and Nepal; see boxes 1.11 and 1.13 innote 1.2, Community-Based Forest Management).Engagement of the private sector. Private sector engagement in forest activities is increasing (see chapter 2, Engaging the Private Sector in Forest Sector Development). Communities need to link with the private sector in forest activities to further enhance forests' contribution to povertyreduction. The growing demand for timber for processinginto pulp and paper as well as for fuelwood (for example,from tea companies in Kenya) creates opportunities for communities to benefit from these private investments.Community-company partnerships can take various forms,including outgrower schemes or arrangements forcommunity provision of management services (such asthinning, pruning, fire maintenance, and the like). Community-company partnerships are distinct from arrangements in which private entities (normallyconcessionaires) compensate communities for the use offorests. In partnerships, communities enter into legalcontracts with companies and provide specific services. Potential for forest-based small and medium enterprises. Small and medium forest enterprises (SMFEs) make up a large percentage of forest enterprises, with far-reaching poverty-alleviation potential. In many forestcountries, forest-based SMFEs account for 80-90 percent ofall national forest enterprises. Approximately 20 million people worldwide are employed in SMFEs. These enterprisesgenerate a gross value added of about US$130 peryear (Macqueen, Armitage and Jaecky, 2006). In countrieswith SMFEs, often more than 50 percent of total forest-related employment is in these enterprises. Numerousfactors influence the feasibility, appropriate structure, andsuitable direction of an SMFE program (see note 2.2, Smalland Medium Forest Enterprises). Moreover, in manycountries policies need to be developed to create an enablingframework for SMFEs. Nevertheless, where there is demandand potential, these enterprises offer room for managingforests and alleviating poverty. Access to microfinance schemes. Access to microfinance schemes can help small-scale forest enterprises build material goods, increase income, and reduce vulnerability toeconomic stresses and external shocks. Microfinance canassist in covering capital costs to improve productivity andquality as well as working capital to purchase equipmentand materials. Access to credit and other microenterprisesupporting services are often limited for poor, forest-dependent households. Commercial financiers seldom lendmoney to the rural poor because of the associatedtransaction costs, and the limited collateral, especially when 20 CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTIONrural poor households do not have secure tenure and access rights. Often poor households borrow from private lendersat unreasonably high interest rates to obtain money they urgently need. This often results in households having to exploit resources unsustainably to pay interest charges. Thehigh interest rates often result in households either neverrepaying or slowly paying back the capital. Access to technical and marketing services. Small-scale enterprises also need access to technical and marketing services. Given the low incomes of households involved andthe low unit value of fuelwood and nontimber products,provision of conventional technical services may not be feasible. In such cases, facilitating the exchange of information among villagers through various channels can be beneficial. Greater market access for forest products. Increasing market access for forest products can enhanceforests' contribution to alleviating poverty. Small timberproducers need to be more competitive with large timbercompanies, both in niche and domestic markets. Thisrequires small timber producers to address challenges, suchas lack of economies of scale. Creating arrangements thatwould facilitate smallholder marketing of timber wouldenhance that sector's contribution to income generation. Some simple changes include reversing the existing forestryregulations that tend to discriminate against small farmersand microenterprises by having fewer and simplerregulations and less paper work (see note 1.5, MakingMarkets Work for the Forest-Dependent Poor). In some countries and regions, aggregate demand for fuelwood, wood for charcoal, and for commercially valu-able nontimber forest products (for example, bushmeat) isgrowing. These are often peri-urban markets that can beprofitable, making it economically attractive for farmers toplant trees and produce or harvest the needed commodi-ties. There are also growing markets for furniture andhousing materials, including construction timber andpoles. Support for producing and marketing better qualityproducts as well as improved infrastructure for accessingthese markets could provide more employment and betterremuneration, particularly if domestic per capita incomegrows. Such support can be provided through microenter-prise development activities that provide attention to theassociated natural resource issues and ensure a sustainablesupply of raw material. Another rapidly expanding market is that of environ- mental services provided by forests (see note 2.3, InnovativeMarketing Arrangements for Environmental Services),including carbon sequestration (see the World Bank's Car- bon Finance Unit Operations Handbook at http://carbonfinance.org/Router.cfm?Page=DocLib&ht=34&dl=1). These markets need to be accessible to forest-dependent households if they are to serve the purpose of engenderingsustainable resource use and land-use practices. Creatingthe enabling conditions will require, among other things,clear and secure rights over forests and woodlands. Importance of forest and tree components in agroforestry. Forest and tree components will often become more important where there is greater reliance onagroforestry. This can happen in the following instances: where changes in the availability of land, labor, and cap- ital favor tree crops as low-input land uses where labor isthe limiting factor (for example, in multistory \"home gardens\" that increase land productivity), or as low-cost inputs into farm systems (for example, in place of pur-chased fertilizer) where growth in agricultural incomes can lead to increasing local commercialization of subsistence goods,such as fuelwood and other forest products where improved rural infrastructure gives farmersgreater access to markets for forest fruits and other prod-ucts of trees that can be grown as part of farm systems Reversing existing top-down approaches. The contribution forests could make to rural development, forest conservation, and economic growth has beenundermined by conventional top-down approaches to forestry. Transparent and accountable governance is criticalto fostering pro-poor growth and essential to ensuring thatthis natural resource wealth is managed wisely. There is alsoa need to remove or relax regulatory provisions thatreinforce the structural and scale advantages that the state possesses as producer of many forest products. The relationship between the forest department and small localproducers would also benefit from separation of theregulatory function of the former from involvement inforest management and delivery of support services (seenote 5.2, Reforming Forest Institutions). Importance of local leadership, institutional capacity, and human resources. Activities oriented toward poverty reduction call for exceptional local leadership, institutionalcapacity, and adequate human resources in implementingagencies. These are not always available on the sustained basis required for operations that typically span several years. CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTION 21Institutional development of capacity takes time. Thus, long- term technical assistance appears to be an indispensable part offuture poverty-oriented interventions. Experiences in Brazil and Mexico suggest that options for the delivery of technical assistance should include consideration of training of ruralproducers and careful exploration of the tradeoffs involved inprivatizing technical assistance because the latter can reducethe possibility of building up institutional capacity of government agencies. Often, investments by national governments in rural areas are low. This is partly due to an inadequate under-standing of poverty rates and poverty density in forest areas.Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) have become the main mechanism for governments in developing coun- tries and some middle-income countries to define theirbudget and policy priorities and discuss those prioritieswith the international community. Unfortunately, however,in the initial PRSPs, interim PRSPs, and National ForestPrograms (NFPs), the pivotal role of forests in sustainingrural livelihoods, especially those of the poor and marginal-ized, has been neglected. There has been relatively littleanalysis of the contribution of forests to rural livelihoods,nor of the measures required to capture or expand thepotential. Forest and tree products, particularly nontimberforest products, often fall between sectors with neither forestry nor agricultural agencies collecting data on house-hold collection, use, and sales (see note 1.1, Mainstreamingthe Role of Forests in Poverty Alleviation: MeasuringPoverty-Forest Linkages). FUTURE PRIORITIES AND SCALING-UP ACTIVITIES In many regions the issues of natural resource management, poverty reduction, and local empowerment are looselyintertwined and cannot be tackled in isolation. Most of the linkages between forestry and rural poverty are also closely associated with what is happening in agriculture and therural economy. For example, conversion of forests to eithertemporary or permanent agriculture can contribute topoverty alleviation. Forestry and agriculture activities need to be closely aligned with components of rural developmentstrategies and programs. This could be done through the following: Adapting forestry and agriculture interventions to changes being introduced in forestry, agriculture, and ruraleconomies. For example, agroforestry, tree crop planta- tions, and scattered trees on farmland can potentiallyassist with poverty alleviation while conserving forests. Forest and tree components will be more important wherechanges in agriculture result in greater reliance on agro-forestry; this could occur as a result of the availability ofland, labor, or capital favoring tree crops; agriculturalincome increasing local commercialization of subsistencegoods such as fuelwood; or improved rural infrastructureproviding farmers with greater access to markets. Exploiting opportunities that rural development inter- ventions create for forest-based activities. The growingimportance of nonfarm rural activities as a source of rural household income and the share of nonfarm total income accounted for by forest product activities makethis an important avenue by which forests can contributeto poverty alleviation. Understanding and taking into account information on cross-sectoral impacts of forest-based poverty situations. For forest activities to have pro-poor impacts and reduce poverty, future activities must focus on better distribution of resource rights, both property and procedural. Controlover and access to resources critical to growth and liveli-hoods is the main governance issue for rural people, includ- ing Indigenous Peoples and other communities with cus-tomary rights. There is a need for greater commitment toensure that the rights of communities and forest-dependenthouseholds are entrenched in appropriate legislation andregulations, that mechanisms exist to implement them, and that these mechanisms are functioning properly. This includes establishing ownership and precisely definingrights, which will provide incentives for the poor to invest inforest management. Equally important is the need for formsof governance for common pool resources that can addressthe weaknesses in many existing comanagement systems(see note 1.3, Indigenous Peoples and Forests, and note 1.4,Property and Access Rights). Timber harvesting must become more pro-poor. Local access to and management of natural forests, smallholdertree growing, and small-scale enterprise development asstrategies to avoid capture by local elites in CBFM are cen- tral to a more pro-poor use of timber (see note 1.2, Com-munity-Based Forest Management). There is a need toremove regulatory barriers and excessive state regulation tofacilitate CBFM in areas other than degraded forests andenable management of forests for multiple purposes. Froman analytical standpoint, there is a need for more researchinto pluralistic systems of comanagement that really dofunction effectively and equitably and for pilot testing ofthose models that show promise. 22 CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTIONFrameworks, regulations, and encouragement are needed to make natural resource markets work for the poor. This requires responding to market failures and imperfect competition and identifying new opportunities that allow the poor to take advantage of their available assets. The col- lection and sale of timber and nontimber forest productsare important for the poor. There is a need to look into theirvalue-added potential and improved marketing strategies. Additionally, strategies need to ensure that the poor are notnegatively affected by increasing commercialization (seenote 1.5, Making Forests Work for the Forest-DependentPoor). Studies should also be undertaken to determinewhether growing urban domestic markets for forest prod- ucts have significantly benefited the poor. Similarly, payment for environmental services, such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, hydrologi- cal benefits, and forest-based tourism, is a potentially impor-tant source of revenue. It is important for the structure ofsuch payments to allow for benefits to flow to the poor aswell as for maintenance of services (see note 2.3, InnovativeMarketing Arrangements for Environmental Services). There is a need to create and enhance the role of forest- dependent communities and households in SMFEs and tofoster forest partnerships between communities and the pri-vate sector. This will require incentives, regulations, and actions at the national level that facilitate these arrange-ments. T echnical support must be provided to communi-ties, and private entities must be required to look beyondlogging and the timber processing industry to the long-termsustainability of forest resources (see chapter 2, Engagingthe Private Sector in Forest Sector Development). T o promote forest uses for poverty alleviation, forest activities that primarily address biodiversity conservationneed to be refocused to take a balanced approach thatincludes poverty alleviation. Conservation objectives forforests of value to local people will need to be revised frombeing predominantly protection oriented to encouragingsustainable systems that produce livelihood benefits. Theincreased recognition of Indigenous Peoples rights to theirland and natural resources should also be further enhancedin biodiversity conservation activities (see note 1.3, Indige-nous Peoples and Forests). National forest programs can provide a broad platform with which to engage in a poverty reduction agenda byworking toward coherent sector policies\u2014and forests needto be integrated into a comprehensive rural developmentstrategy (see note 6.4, Assessing Cross-Sectoral Impacts: Useof CEAs and SEAs). Such integration will be facilitated byimproved knowledge and understanding of the extent towhich the very large numbers of poor people living in or near forests depend upon those forests for their liveli-hood\u2014a matter of significance to poverty alleviation out- comes in general in some countries (see note 1.1, Main- streaming the Role of Forests in Poverty Alleviation:Measuring Poverty-Forest Linkages). It is important togather information on whether the depletion of forestresources has had a negative impact on poor people, and whether the poor have been able to find alternatives to for-est safety nets and gap fillers (see also note 1.3 on the par-ticular risks and impacts to Indigenous Peoples). Equallyimportant is a comprehensive examination of how existingWorld Bank data systems and records could be used to improve knowledge about the forest dependency of people dwelling in or near large natural forest resources in WorldBank client countries. This needs to be developed throughthe appropriate networks of the World Bank in collabora-tion with Country Departments. SELECTED READINGS Angelsen, A., and S.

Y et the contribution of forests to income and the level of forest dependence are seldom systematically documented. Income streams from forests and the role offorests as safety nets are underestimated and the potential offorests to alleviate poverty is often unexploited. The lack ofquantitative and readily available information on the role of forests in contributing to poverty reduction is a major con-straint to mainstreaming the use of forests in poverty allevi-ation. A consequence is that the role of forests in povertyreduction is not reflected in any significant way in national-level strategies, such as the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) process. In the same way, those countries that have been developing NFPs (NFPs; see note 6.1, Using NationalForest Programs to Mainstream Forest Issues) have nottended to explicitly link forest issues to poverty reduction orto the achievement of the MDGs. If PRSPs fail to incorpo-rate forestry, national efforts to reduce poverty and vulner-ability will undercount the critical role that forest resourcescurrently play\u2014and the potentially greater role they couldplay\u2014in the livelihoods of the poor. There are two constraints to improving measurement and mainstreaming of linkages between forests and poverty.First, most countries have little data available to illustrate how forests contribute to the livelihoods of poor house-holds. The Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS;www.worldbank.org/lsms) have a variable on fuelwoodconsumption, but owing to the logistical and cultural chal-lenges of surveying forest-dwelling and forest-reliant house-holds in remote areas, the data associated with this variableare limited. It also is difficult to accurately measure andattribute the cash value of extracted forest products tohouseholds residing in high-population-density areas andforest-agriculture mosaics (Chomitz et al. 2006). The second challenge is that the data that do exist arerarely presented in ways that are meaningful to those designing PRSPs and NFPs. Forest specialists are morefamiliar with reporting forest information about physical resources (trees planted, forest cover improved, or timber sold) than livelihoods, with the exception of quantifying thenumber of people employed in the forest sector. Povertyexperts and macroeconomists are unfamiliar with the use offorests and NFPs and tend to underestimate the contribu- tion of forests and off-farm natural resources to livelihoods. OPERATIONAL ASPECTS There is little knowledge about how rural households depend on forest and tree resources to meet their dailyneeds\u2014and even less about the potential of these resources to reduce poverty. This failure stems in part from the fact that forest products, especially nontimber forest products,fall through the cracks of sector-specific data collection,with neither forestry nor agricultural agencies collectingdata on household collection, use, and sale of forest prod- ucts. A simple methodology is needed to capture this con-tribution and to demonstrate its ultimate relevance to manyof the MDGs. This is what the Poverty-Forest LinkagesT oolkit offers (box 1.4). This section provides a summary ofkey steps for measuring poverty-forest linkages and main- streaming this information, based on the approach detailed in the toolkit. Only at the national level can current country processes for poverty data gathering be identified and understood andeffort invested in enabling these to take forest data intoaccount. And only through local enquiry can a picture bedeveloped of the two key ways in which forests have animpact on the lives of the poor\u2014positively through liveli-hood support, and negatively if use of forests is formallyillegal. T o this end, the toolkit lays out a step-by-step processto gather and analyze the necessary information, detailing 25Mainstreaming the Role of Forests in Poverty Alleviation: Measuring Poverty-Forest LinkagesNOTE 1.1activities to be undertaken at the national, district, and local levels. Undertaking a national-level analysis. The purpose of a national-level analysis is to find out whether the contribution of forests to poverty reduction is already beingmainstreamed into current national policies, programs, andlaws, and whether poverty issues are being taken intoaccount in forest sector processes. If they are, the aim is to understand how, and if not, to identify country-specificpathways by which they could be. The toolkit explains how the relevant natural resources ministries need to be involved and how to find out what the relevant entry points might be for more focus on the con-tribution of forests to the livelihoods of the poor (box 1.5).Tasks include identifying the main ministry hosting the PRS 26 CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTIONThe Poverty-Forest Linkages T oolkitais designed to meet two objectives. First, it aims to increase knowl- edge about how rural households depend on forest and tree resources to meet their daily need, and the poten- tial of this resource to reduce poverty. Second, theT oolkit assists in engaging in a process of mainstream-ing this information into national planning processes,including PRSPs. The T oolkit provides a framework for gathering and analyzing information to provide a clearunderstanding of the current and potential role of for-est and tree products for poverty reduction. It includessocial, institutional, and environmental concerns, inthe context of local and national planning processes.An integral part is the identification of the most forest- dependent communities, and the impact of current and potential policies and programs. The Poverty-Forest Linkages T oolkit may be used by forestry departments, local governments, and non-governmental organization (NGO) facilitators todeliver the following: Local-level \"snapshot data\" on forest reliance and the livelihood and poverty reduction contributionof forests A documented case for the contribution of foreststo the livelihoods of the poor Analyses of how forestry regulations promote orhinder the livelihoods of the rural poor Strengthened agency and institutional capacity toidentify opportunities and constraints An assessment of issues (for example, inappropriateregulations) that need to be resolved if povertyreduction is to be effectively addressed by forestry officials The toolkit provides a complete set of tools, meth- ods, examples, and case studies for the task, including the following: An explanation of the PRSP process and identifica- tion of the strategies needed for influencing it(including potential entry points for forestry) A set of rapid appraisal methods to gather informa-tion on cash and subsistence contributions fromforests to households, particularly the poor Methods for analyzing field data for the potentialrole of forests in reducing poverty and vulnerability,and policy options for improving the contribution of forests to rural livelihoods Suggestions for how to frame the results, so as to be relevant to the planners, government agencies, andother institutions and organizations at both local and national levels A series of case studies that illustrate the contribu- tion of forest resources to households and an analy-sis of the impact of forestry policies and programs Included are annexes on the tools, with instruction for their use; a series of examples of all the tools, illus- trating the data they generate; an explanation of how toanalyze documents collected; and an example of a short document that might be written for distributionto government officials when explaining the purpose ofthe toolkit.Box 1.4 Poverty-Forest Linkages T oolkit Source: Authors' compilation using PROFOR forthcoming a. a. In May 2004, with PROFOR support, the World Conservation Union (IUCN), Overseas Development Institute, Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), PROFOR, and Winrock International formed a working group partnership with theintent of consolidating and building upon the growing knowledg e base from fieldwork and research efforts on the different ways in which forests can benefit the poor. The result was the draft Poverty-Forest Linkages T oolkit, which was piloted in four countries prior to finalization. process, the main donors to the process, other important players (civil society groups, NGOs, and so forth), and thekey documents that have been produced. These might include household, rural, or living standard surveys; a national census; or the drafting of an NFP . National-levelanalysis makes it clear whether the efforts to measurepoverty-forest linkages can proceed with the support of theforest ministry or those responsible for the PRS. Gathering information at the village or community level. After the national-level analysis has been completed, the next step is to collect data to identify forest-householduse linkages at the local level. The results generated will beused at both the district and field levels and at higher(provincial and national) levels to underline thecontribution of forests and trees to the livelihoods of thepoor, and sometimes to highlight ways in which thepresence of anachronistic, anti-poor forest policies or lawsare an impediment to poverty reduction. The toolkit detailsseveral tools for identifying users (and nonusers) of forestresources, the level of dependency on and contribution offorest and tree products, existing resources and products,and key constraints of the existing system (see boxes 1.6and 1.7). Preparing and presenting data for different audiences. Data gathered need to be analyzed and prepared in different formats for presentation to districtand higher levels. Information should be presented in user-friendly forms (for example, diagrams and charts) thataccurately represent what is occurring at the local level, highlight essential livelihood information and criticalfactors (such as access and tenure, markets, and status ofresources), and satisfy the needs of users of the data. Theinformation should be debated at the district level andreframed, with the assistance of local officials, to fit withdistrict-to-national reporting requirements. Districtofficials' views on the incorporation of forest contributionsto incomes into data-gathering systems should be writtenup and submitted to the national-level body responsible forcollecting poverty data or to the forest ministry, or to both.At the national level, this information is further streamlinedto fit with the formats needed for the PRSP process, the NFPprocess, and others as relevant (see box 1.8). Furthermore, many countries have found that disseminating a simpleguide to the results of the assessment makes a largedifference to the extent to which ideas are understood andacted upon. The progress a country has already made in drafting its PRS and developing data-gathering and monitoring instru- ments should inform the planning of analysis and datagathering of poverty-forest linkages. If a country already has data-gathering systems in place at the local level and collatesthe data at the national level, the focus of the exercise will beon linking forest and poverty data by, among otherprocesses, learning whether forest product contribution isrecorded and integrated into income and livelihood assess- ments and, subsequently, discussing with the appropriatebodies ways of inserting forest data into national povertydata collection systems and poverty data into national forestdata collection systems. If, however, no such national data-gathering systems exist, the T oolkit outlines forest-focusedparticipatory poverty assessments to generate a national-level picture of the contribution of forests to povertythrough \"snapshots\" from different forest contexts aroundthe country. The T oolkit further describes how to collatecollected data for discussion and planning purposes withinthe PRS process. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS A participatory approach to measuring poverty could pro- vide more detailed information on the informal and formaluses of forest resources. Informal uses are often overlooked because they are not easily valued\u2014but these uses reflect the important role of forests as safety nets. Without a comprehensive understanding of forest dependency, policies and investments may discriminate NOTE 1.1: MAINSTREAMING THE ROLE OF FORESTS IN POVERTY ALLEVIATION: MEASURING POVERTY -FOREST LINKAGES 27In testing the toolkit in Indonesia, key informant interviews conducted in the capital revealed thatthe entry points offered by the Ministry of Forests and other national-level institutions were limited for reassessing the relationship between forestsand the poor. Instead, other pathways were found.Work was undertaken in one province at the dis-trict and provincial levels, and a series of mini for- est-focused participatory poverty assessmentsmade their mark at lower levels. Commitment andenthusiasm were generated, and, in due course,provincial-level actors began to be able to drivenational-level change from below.

Note: People from whom information is sought are listed in parentheses. Livelihood analysis can be used to discover the extent of reliance on forest resources and the proportion oftheir contribution to annual cash and noncash incomes. In groups selected by gender and wealth cat- egory, participants are asked to distribute beans orstones across a list of forest products (for example,gum, charcoal, timber), allocating more where cashincome sources are more important. The exercise is repeated for farm produce (crops and livestock), othersources, such as petty trade, and for noncash incomesources. Participants are then asked to list sources of cash for different kinds of expenditures and identifywhether the forest is used for investment. This exercise can show forest contributions to the achievement of the MDGs. For example, in eradicating extremepoverty and hunger (goal 1), villagers in Busongo cite20-29 percent of livelihoods comes from forest contri-butions and that charcoal, fuelwood, ghee and milk, livestock, gum, thatch, and fodder grass contributedirectly and indirectly to the meeting of these goals.Box 1.7 Livelihood Analysis in Busongo, Tanzania Source: PROFOR forthcoming b.against the forest-dependent rural poor. A lack of under- standing of the scale and scope of forest dependence canresult in governments giving private companies and large farmers preferential access to publicly owned forest resources, conservation policies that deprive poor familiesaccess to forest resources, or governments expropriatingvillagers' rights over local forests. Communities often invest the income generated from formal and informal uses of forest resources. Detailed information on forest resource use and how it is investedcan provide insight into community priorities (for exam-ple, in Busongo, Tanzania, communities used cash revenuefrom forest resources, including gum and charcoal, to help primary-age children access schools, and village forests were used to construct staff housing and extra classroomsfor primary schools). When proposing a forest-related action in a PRSP , it is important to have a clear rationale for selecting the actionas a priority. Integration of forest issues into PRSPs willrequire a quantitative causal link between forests andpoverty. It is therefore crucial to include important forestenvironmental income sources in poverty assessments andPRSPs. T o effectively integrate forest-poverty information into PRSPs, it is useful to be familiar with the poverty analysisprocess used in PRSPs (available in the Poverty ReductionStrategies Sourcebook).

Source: PROFOR forthcoming b.Box 1.8 Ident ifying Opportunities Getting Poverty-Forest Linkages into Data-Collection Systems: Example from TanzaniaAn often overlooked trend in the world is a dou- bling of community tenure in the past 15 years.During this time, the area under private but col- lective ownership has increased from 143.3 million to 246.3 million hectares of forests. Similarly, the estimated areaunder public but collective administration has increasedfrom 18.5 million to 131.4 million hectares. In sum, community- owned and administered forest totals at least 377 million hectares, or at least 22 percent of all forests indeveloping countries and three times as much forest as isowned by industry or individuals (White and Martin 2002).Poverty alleviation strategies in the forestry sector haveemphasized local participation to make forest management more responsive to local needs and to increase benefits flowing to forest users. As more of the world's forests comeunder community tenure, community- based forest man-agement (CBFM) practices are continually being promotedas playing an important role in poverty alleviation, goodgovernance, and sustainable use of the environment. Involving communities in sustainable forest resource use is not a new concept. In 1977, the World Bank Forestry Sec-tor Review (World Bank 1977) noted that many forestryprojects failed without the collaboration of local residentsand that their collaboration improved environmental out-comes. It stressed the need to learn more about how to sup- port policies that successfully give management and bene-fits to smallholders and the need to better understand localuse, forestry- related practices, and traditional institutions.Learning from these lessons and the growing evidence ofpositive outcomes of CBFM, the current World Bank strat-egy focuses on, among other goals, using forests for povertyalleviation and strengthening local governance and trans-parency to address corruption. CBFM can be an importantentry point for achieving these goals. It can also be an out-come of good policy related to poverty, governance, and the environment. CBFM includes the empowerment of, or in some cases, the recognition of the rights of, local communities to sus- tainably manage, control, use, and benefit from local forest resources (see boxes 1.9 and 1.10). It implies a legal, politi- cal, and economic framework that puts local people at thecenter of forestry. Community objectives for managing for-est land can include conservation, sustainable use, localcontrol, economic development, and mixes of these objec- tives. While the state and large private operators have a roleto play in the management of forests, in many instances,improved effectiveness, equity, and efficiency are outcomesof community- based approaches. Community management of forests and other lands is larger in scale and more intensely linked to other sectorsthan is commonly acknowledged. From a management anduse perspective, essentially all forests, however remote andseemingly physically unoccupied, have traditional ownersand users. The assumption should not be a need to imposeoutside management over \"unmanaged\" or vacant lands buta need to carefully assess traditional systems, owners, andusers of forests. Recent work in Gabon, a highly forestedand lightly populated country, shows that even there tradi-tional use zones abut one another and there is no\"unclaimed\" forest land. Frequently, the issue is recognitionof existing or traditional local rights rather than transfer of new rights to the local level, as is illustrated in the India casestudy (see box 1.12; also note 1.3, Indigenous Peoples andForests). A variety of outside interventions can be used to support CBFM, including grants and loans, policy support pro-grams and projects, global environment funds, and biodi-versity conservation activities. However, CBFM is notthe use of communities to achieve the objectives of outsiders,no matter how laudable these objectives may be. CBFM isthe empowerment of communities to use and manageforests to achieve their own objectives. Community- Based Forest ManagementNOTE 1.2 30OPERATIONAL ASPECTS The role of natural resources in economic growth and good governance. Natural resources play a fundamental role in the economic growth of poor countries and poor populations and in the development of democracies and good governance. Some specific steps forconsideration include the following: Understand the different perspectives that government, communities, private operators, and other stakeholdershave of devolution and its mode of implementation. A shared framework, more accountable to local livelihood needs and peoples' rights to self- determination, isrequired. Redefining issues of wider \"public interest\"forms part of this process, as does a careful analysis of themotivations and the negative incentives. Consider and support, if appropriate, the shift of priori- ties in programs, budgets, and plans toward greaterinvestment and integration of natural resources across the board in agricultural and poverty reduction pro-grams, in national and donor budgets, in decentraliza-tion programs, and in other initiatives, at the policy,national planning, and forestry project levels. Develop pathways for more transparent information and communication that are locally accepted and that areadaptable for community through national political and donor levels. Create a baseline of biophysical and socioeconomic fac- tors. There are several methodologies, including thosedetailed in the Poverty- Forest Linkages T oolkit (see note 1.1, Mainstreaming the Role of Forests in Poverty Allevi- ation: Measuring Poverty- Forest Linkages) and throughCIFOR's Poverty Environment Network (http://www.cifor.cgiar.org/pen/). In addition, the International For-est Resources and Institutions (IFRI) Research Program describes a comprehensive methodology for measuring NOTE 1.2: COMMUNITY - BASED FOREST MANAGEMENT 31Many types of community forestry have been imple- mented in different parts of the world. In Latin Amer-ica, there have been three main types: Communities with clear rights given by theirnational governments to participate in commercialtimber harvesting, such as in Bolivia, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico. Communities that manage extractive reserves, such as in Brazil, where the government gives them clearrights over the land and forests, while limiting the amount of forest to be cleared for agriculture and prohibiting commercial logging. Communities earnmoney by selling nontimber forest products. Countries where the territorial rights of Indigenous Peoples over the areas that they have traditionallymanaged have been recognized. In China, villagers are being given more control over heavily degraded lands if they agree with local forestry officials on how to rehabilitate the forestswhile also using them for their own subsistence. In India and Nepal, limited rights to what are still offi-cially considered public lands have been devolved tolocal communities to manage and benefit from forests.Revenues from commercial forestry activities areshared with the government. In Southeast Asia and the Pacific, partnerships are developed between communities and logging compa-nies to ensure that the communities share in the bene-fits and that logging companies do not damage theresources the communities would like to protect. Several models exist in Africa: Community forest programs that protect wildlife for tourism and sport hunting in return for a share of thefees paid by the tourists and hunters. Examples of this model can be found in Zimbabwe and Botswana. Projects focused on increasing villagers' incomes through sale of their fuelwood and charcoal, as inMali and Niger. Programs designed to recognize the rights of com-munities over their forests, as in Tanzania and Mozambique. Programs designed to allow communities to sell tim-ber commercially, if supported by a logging com-pany or donor project. In Cameroon, this has greatly limited the number of communities involved.Box 1.9 Community Forestry Models around the World Source: Kaimowitz 2005. the biophysical resource through forest plots and overall forest condition, as well as for developing data on localuse, economic and market value, rules of use, and all lev- els of relevant institutional arrangements (for more information, see Clay, Alcorn, and Butler 2000). Distribution of resource rights. Better distribution of resource rights, both property and procedural, is needed. Common attempts at decentralization of forest resources(see note 5.1, Decentralized Forest Management) are oftencompromised; they often do not go far enough in therecognition of the rights of, or transfer of rights to, localpeople, or if appropriate policy exists, it often is notimplemented or implementation is skewed toward specificgroups (see boxes 1.10 and 1.14). Furthermore, in manycases, effective handover has been either limited to badlydegraded forests or under institutional arrangements thatare impractical or conflict with local organization.Organizational models that devolve authority directly todisadvantaged resource users are more embracing of localinterests and priorities than those that allocate control tohigher levels of political or social organization. An equallyimportant outcome is the decreased inequality andimproved political and social articulation of local people. Potential specific steps to enhance devolution of resource rights include the following: Understand motives for participation by identifying incentives and constraints in CBFM at community andnational levels. Many more forestry projects fail as a result of negative incentives for community members than as a result of lack of education on how to manageforest resources (see box 1.12). It is important to under-stand who will foster and who will block an initiative andhow to create a supportive environment for the required changes. Support strong local organizational capacity and enhance political capital outcomes for local people byenabling them to mobilize resources and negotiate for better benefits. NGOs, donors, federations, and other external actors have a key role in moving devolution pol-icy and practice toward local interests. Identify traditional institutions and rules influencing property and use of resources and endogenous pathwaysfor resolving conflicts and their effects on formal land rights. Allow communities to handle these issues and to propose mechanisms accepted by all key stakeholdersthat foster sustainable management and conflict resolution. Consider the need for a special good governance pro- gram at the community level to address such issues aselite capture and increased transparency (see box 1.11). Framework and regulation for natural resource markets to benefit the poor. Natural resource markets will work for the poor only with the development offrameworks, regulations, and enforcement. If commodity chains are biased against the poor (and remain so), increasing 32 CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTIONSome countries, including India and Nepal, have devolved limited rights to local communities tomanage and benefit from forests that are still offi- cially considered public land. This process is also under way in most of the African continent, withmore complete transfer of rights present inCameroon, The Gambia, and Tanzania. Thesearrangements, known by such terms as \"joint for- est management\" and \"comanagement\" do notalter state ownership and can be revoked by thestate at any time, making them a much weakerform of property rights than the rights providedby private community- based ownership. In Brazil,for example, where some 75 million hectares of state- owned lands have been set aside for indige- nous communities, the communities have no rightto harvest their timber, even under sustainablemanagement regimes. Some other countries arebeginning to adjust traditional industrial loggingconcession arrangements to include indigenousand other local communities. In British Columbia,Canada, the provincial government recentlyagreed to allow Weyerhaeuser Limited to transferits concession rights to a new business venturewith a coalition of indigenous groups as the leadpartner. The coalition now has majority owner-ship of use rights to a portion of its ancestral homelands\u2014 but not to the land itself. TheGuatemalan government has granted timber con-cessions to local communities rather than to largeindustries, and the early experience is positive. Inthe Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR),the government has launched a similar participa-tory management pilot program involving 60 vil-lages under 50-year management contracts. Source : IUCN and World Wildlife Fund 2004.Box 1.10 Different Degrees of Devolution of Forest Management to Communitiesthe poor's market integration may increase poverty, not reduce it (see box 1.13). This issue is further discussed in note1.5, Making Markets Work for the Forest- Dependent Poor. Some specific steps for consideration include the following: Facilitate the organization and legal recognition of localgroups for collecting, processing, transporting, and mar-keting natural resources. Analyze commodity chains and market weakness anddevelop strategies that benefit the poor. Support market studies and locally managed marketinformation systems so that the full range of forest prod-ucts and outputs are considered. Create simple management plans in which local usersmake at least some of their own rules related to use offorest products. Support systems of regular user monitoring, and sanc-tion rule conformance of other users backed by the government. Use of science and technology to support and empower local forest management initiatives andobjectives. T oo often, an unintended consequence of using complex scientific and technical plans and institutions hasbeen the exclusion of local people from planning andmanaging, or marginalization of local technical, social, andinstitutional knowledge. This is evident in the commonpractice of demanding complex, costly, and sophisticatedforest management plans from local communities. Suchmisuse of science and technology should be reversed. Some specific steps that can be taken include the following: Develop minimum management standards directly related to forest and poverty outcomes rather thanabstract management procedures. Develop locally adapted tools that are understood andmanageable by local actors themselves regarding evalua-tion and quantification of natural resources and shared use by communities. NOTE 1.2: COMMUNITY - BASED FOREST MANAGEMENT 33Nepal has a great deal of experience to offer in under- standing the benefits and concerns of locally managedforests. It was the first country to have a national forestry policy allowing communities to form forest user groups (FUGs) that, after they elect leaders anddevelop a constitution and management plan, can beassigned control of and benefits from specific forestplots. T o strengthen their groups against potential challenges as forest productivity and value increasethrough management, the groups have formed a federation. Elite capture is a key issue to be addressed during decentralization, as was the case in some situations inNepal. How local control impacts equity in asset distri- bution, and whether local groups can develop the transparency and other mechanisms necessary to avoidcorruption, are important considerations. An NGO, Women Acting T ogether for Change, worked closely with the FUGs on equity, democracy,and transparency through a process that includedhousehold visits to FUG members to discuss good gov-ernance of forest resources. The community then car-ried out community resource, social, and economicassessments, and workshops in which the leaders and members identified what good governance wouldmean in their group and identified very specific goals with clear indicators that they designed into posters to monitor progress. An evaluation of this project foundthat many groups rewrote their constitutions and man-agement plans giving special advantages to poorermembers, and established open group audits. They elected lower caste and women members to some ofthe leadership positions, often for the first time, andidentified totally new goals. At the Fourth National Community Forestry Work- shop in Nepal (2004), regional directors andresearchers noted that at that time leadership in the FUGs and their federation were the only democrati- cally elected bodies in the country, forming a basis forfuture democracy. Lessons from this example include that in a country with very stratified social traditions, even when there ispositive legal support, it takes skilled facilitators andgroup analysis with democratic approaches to mitigateelite capture and lack of transparency and to createpositive outcomes for the poor.Box 1.11 Improving Equity and Governance and Addressing Elite Capture in Nepal Source: Women Acting T ogether for Change 2004.Elaborate appropriate tools for continual follow- up on how the management system works and the effects ofmanagement by communities. Identify different user groups in each area and theirinteractions under the participatory development framework. Use simpler management plans in which local usersmake at least some of their own rules related to use offorest products and control over encroachment. CBFM is complex, can be costly, and involves many stakeholders and vested interests that may support or oppose CBFM activities. (See, for example, Clay, Alcorn, andButler 2000; Borrini- and should be noted: Successful CBFM is a slow process and needs to be based on informed participation, capacity building, and trust. Enhancement of land and resource tenure of IndigenousPeoples tends to improve CBFM and sustainable man-agement of forests (see note 1.4, Property and Access Rights). Without addressing overt as well as hidden power rela- tions and vested interests through clear roles and respon-sibilities, availability of information, transparent and equitable decision- making processes, and monitoring, Indigenous Peoples and other forest- dependent commu-nities may be worse off as a result of project activities (forexample, access to natural resources in their areas mayhave been opened up to other stakeholders, but they do not share in the benefits). 34 CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTIONIndia is a leader in involving communities in tree planting and forest improvement on state- owned for-est land through a strategy called Joint Forest Manage- ment (JFM), with a portion of the benefits from com- munity collaboration going back to participatingcommunities. JFM has taken different forms and hashad contrasting outcomes in the 27 states of Indiawhere it has been applied. Its methods and biophysical and social impacts have interested policy makers fromaround the world. The World Bank has encouragedexpanding JFM and moving it toward community forestry. In 2001, the World Bank supported taking a step fur- ther toward community forestry to better address the Bank's antipoverty, anticorruption, and improved gov- ernance goals. The ManagementProject in Andhra Pradesh stressed that the primaryfocus would be on improving the livelihoods and thephysical, social, and financial assets of rural communi-ties through sustainable tree and forest management.Increased benefits from the improved resource were togo to strengthening communities in a pro- poor strat-egy. Local community groups were to be legally sup-ported to take over control, their institutions were to bestrengthened, and the processes made more transpar-ent. It was recognized that success could be reachedonly with changes in forestry institutions, laws, and reg- ulations and the recognition of tribal land rights. Inearly discussions, the government and other partnersindicated their willingness to support such changes.The project has made good progress on technical matters and needs to further advance institutional improvements. Additional training is needed for ser- vice providers, including NGOs, support agencies, and front- line staff to enhance their ability to work effec-tively with local groups in a participatory manner.Community user groups need to strengthen and formfederations and partnerships to gain power. A number of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) provided small increases in incomes to some commu- nities, and where past plantings were ready for harvest-ing, some communities reinvested in the resource.However, the government has yet to make the requiredlegal amendments to the Forest Code; liberalize trade regulations for NTFP harvesting, processing, and mar- keting; simplify procedures; require more transparentaudits; or make conflict resolution procedures morebalanced. The government of Andhra Pradesh with-drew resources previously allocated to the project. TheWorld Bank reviews stressed the need to address theabove issues and to continue to focus on livelihoodsand pro- poor approaches. The World Bank Report on India (World Bank 2005) noted the handicap to improving local incomeswhen forest resource rights are held by the governmentin spite of proposed legislation to return land that hadbeen taken from tribal groups. The legislation has since been approved in Parliament, opening opportunitiesfor increasing the contribution of forests to local incomes. Box 1.12 Andhra Pradesh Community Forestry Management Project Source: Authors' compilation from World Bank 2002a.Methods to enhance communities' ownership and active collaboration should be assessed for the given projectcontext. Participatory mapping exercises, using mapping tools appropriate for the local communities, should be included. Capacity building is needed for local communities, gov- ernment staff, and other involved stakeholders. Efforts to combine local practices (bottom- up) and gov-ernment or private approaches (top- down) are essential. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS Task managers need to keep in mind not only the technical aspects of forest management but the dangers and limita-tions of a top- down technical approach, the complexity of forest dynamics, as well as local use and rights (both formal and informal). In all cases, an understanding of the motiva-tions of the different actors to support or block the desiredchanges is helpful in knowing if the donor- facilitatedchanges will actually take place. Control over and access to forests not only facilitate eco- nomic growth and poverty reduction but also empower local people to articulate themselves socially and politically.The spillover effects of local control over forests, as in India,Mexico, and Nepal, can be quite large and impact a range ofsectors and decision- making arenas. Because forests can besuch an important share of a poor community's asset port- folio, control over and access to forests is not a trivial gover-nance concern. At the same time, it should be noted that not all com- munity management results in positive outcomes. There areareas with strong migration where transfer of rights to com- munities has not resulted in sustainable management of for-est resources (for example, Ghana and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). Inother countries there is a need to revisit the definition ofcommunity and distinguish between traditional communi- ties managing forests and management of forests by morerecently formed communities. In many developing countries, significant attempts at decentralization have taken place, which, in theory, could greatly facilitate CBFM, local benefits, and empowerment NOTE 1.2: COMMUNITY - BASED FOREST MANAGEMENT 35The World Bank has been involved in the forest sector in Cameroon since 1982, and has helped put forest sec-tor issues at the center of policy debates and encour- aged a multisectoral approach. A review of the World Bank's engagement between 1982 and 1999 found thatinterventions have appropriately focused on policy andinstitutional issues, and some forest product marketinghas been liberalized. However, overall the results of the interventions have not been up to expectations. At thetime, the establishment of a transparent, efficient, andequitable forest management system was compromisedby lack of government commitment and capacity, theresistance of key actors in the sector (including loggingcompanies and parliament), implementation strategies that were not compatible with the underlying political and socioeconomic dynamics, and lack of policyimplementation. In addition, forestry interventionswere isolated from broader rural development con-cerns (agriculture, for example), and permanent mech-anisms for local participation in decision making werenot developed. In Cameroon, tropical timber wealth is concen- trated in a small group of economic agents. The sus-tainability and equity of the sector is largely deter-mined by the structure of the industry, ownership pat- terns, industry investment, employment, and linkageswith the rest of the economy. The structural underpin- nings of the sector have been little affected and local communities have been left out of the reform processdespite a declared objective to include them. TheWorld Bank recommended that communities beactively involved in forest management and in 1994 a law was passed to this effect. However, because rightsand responsibilities have not been specified, there areno clear mechanisms for limiting elite capture and thesharing of taxes has not been fully implemented.Results, therefore, have been mixed. Some lessons learned include (i) the need for broadly based government support and avoiding rely-ing solely on the executive branch to deliver on reformsbecause other powerful individuals or institutions mayhave motivation to block changes; (ii) knowledge andinformation are essential for policy making and imple-mentation, as are clarity and specificity of terms andmechanisms for implementing laws and regulations;(iii) local institutions are needed for success and sus-tainability; and (iv) overdependence on technical assis-tance does not always overcome institutional weakness. Box 1.13 The Forest Sector in Cameroon Source : World Bank OED 2000. (see note 1.4, Property and Access Rights). However, the ways in which local people realize the benefits of devolutiondiffer widely, and the negative tradeoffs are most commonly borne by the poor. Community control and management over natural resources is often limited by continual govern-ment intervention and the government's insistence on com-plex management plans. It is extremely important to facilitate a change in para- digm among forest officials and extension service providers. This can help in transforming the forest department cultureand can be brought about by providing capacity building inparticipatory and community forest management and forprovision of formal services. Such paradigm changes shouldbe accompanied by appropriate incentives to forest staff and adequate budget. In many cases, CBFM can be a lever for wider pro- poor change and reform; in others, basic conditions must be present for it to flourish. The following elements should beconsidered in community forestry programs: Bureaucracy and paper work necessary for communities to have the right to manage their forests should be lim-ited. Communities often do not have the money or the skills required to produce professional management plans, resulting in overdependence on donors and log-ging companies. 36 CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTIONMexican community forestry has perhaps reached a scale and level of maturity unmatched anywhere else inthe world. It has demonstrated that where there has been greater community power over forest manage- ment there has been greater transparency and less cor-ruption, better forest use and protection, andimproved livelihoods for local people. Regions ofgreatest deforestation are where traditional social structures have been seriously weakened (Bray, Merino- Perez, and Barry 2005). An estimated three- fourths of Mexican forests are communally owned either by ejidos (agrarian reform communities) or indigenous communities. Mexicanforest management is rich in indigenous forms of com- mon property management overlaid by massive agri- cultural reforms from the violent Mexican revolutionin the second decade of the 20th century. However,across the country there is great contrast in resourcequality; indigenous groups and their approaches toorganization, equity, and resource use; as well as instate and local leadership. Efforts to support local man-agement have met with mixed results. The World Bankhas worked to improve forest management for envi-ronmental protection and quality of life for local peo-ple, starting with pilot activities in 1990 and thenredesigning a project expanding to other regions, manyof which have needed specially crafted approaches. The Project for Conservation and Sustainable Man- agement of Forest Resources (PROCYMAF) aimed to support community forest development, with a pri-mary focus on Oaxaca but with some program work inGuerrero and Michoacan. PROCYMAF was a community- driven development project. PROCYMAF II retained the environmental and economic aims butfocused on (i) strengthening local capacity and man- agement; (ii) strengthening capacity of the local pri- vate sector to provide forestry services; (iii) promotingtimber, nontimber, and nontraditional products; and(iv) strengthening federal and state institutions work-ing in forestry conservation and development. A more diverse and multisectoral staff supported existing or new community management groups to expand social capital and helped form federations to beable to carry more weight in addressing local issues,including increased transparency and fair returns. Com-munity members as well as professional foresters were trained so that technical issues could become under- stood locally, putting communities in a better positionto negotiate and understand what to require of special-ists and, in some cases, become specialists themselves.The project initiated community- to- community exten-sion and, because there are areas in which there areeither inter- or intra- community conflicts, promoterswere trained in conflict management. The projects didstudies on expanding the options and markets for eco-nomic use of forest products, including such items asmushrooms, bottled water, and resin as well as timber.Communities selected activities they found promising. Devolution of public and private forestlands to local communities with common pool resource regimes and clear tenure status can create economic equality, socialpeace, and democratization of power, addressing cor-ruption and at the same time improving the forestecosystem (Bray, Merino- Perez, and Barry 2005). Box 1.14 Community Forestry in Mexico Source : Authors' compilation using World Bank 2003.Community forestry programs should make rich forest resources available to communities for their use, not justheavily degraded forests (see box 1.14). Transparency in payments to communities is critical.Governments or companies should make sure that vil-lagers are informed of payments made to traditional vil- lage leaders, of amounts paid, and of the intended use for the payments, to limit corruption. Both communities and government should benefit from community forestry projects. Community benefits aremore likely to accrue in situations where commercially viable forest resources, including NTFPs, are available. Governments benefit from expanded collection of taxesand forest fees and from cost savings resulting from areduction in enforcement. Solid feasibility studies and business plans need to be in place, and communities should be familiar with marketconditions. While financial returns should be quick to materialize, this should be balanced with longer- term needs of investing in infrastructure, natural resourceconservation, and at times primary and secondary pro-cessing of wood and marketing of end products. Localknowledge, science, and institutions are often ignored or treated with derision by outsiders, making it difficult toincorporate local knowledge into activity design. It is essential that markets be made to work for the poor and that market failures, such as monopolies, collusion,segmentation, asymmetrical information, and power, are overcome. This means responding to market failures and imperfect competition and identifying new opportuni- ties that take advantage of the assets of the poor, such aslabor and natural resources. Project support should include management capacity building for the community administration. In additionto technical skills, training should cover participatory planning, monitoring, and periodic updating of commu- nity development plans. Individual families should be supported. Collective activities are not always the best approach for commu-nity forestry, especially tree planting activities\u2014 smallholder farmers should be supported in this process. In addition to traditional management of highly stocked forests, secondary forests and low- density woodlandsoffer good opportunities for community management, because they offer multiple agroforestry services and higher flexibility for forest management. Customary claims and particular rights of Indigenous Peoples and other forest- dependent communities shouldbe addressed.SELECTED READINGS Agrawal, A., and C. Gibson, eds. 2001.

Forests and other natural resources are the foundation for most Indigenous Peoples' livelihoods, social organization, identities, and cultural survival, whichare based on a strong and deeply rooted historic relation-ship with their ancestral lands and natural resources. Thisrelationship has cultural, socioeconomic, and spiritual dimensions and has influenced customary institutions andpractices for managing land and resources. The identities and cultures of Indigenous Peoples are inextricably linked to the lands on which they live and thenatural resources on which they depend. This deeply rooted link informs their livelihoods, social organization, identi- ties, and cultural survival. It also informs their perceptionsof poverty, well- being, and \"the good life,\" which often dif-fer from those of mainstream society as well as of otherrural communities. Their patterns of land use and relation-ship with land and resources may also translate into differ-ent goals and models for development\u2014 for example, devel-opers may want to extract natural resources for economicgain, while indigenous communities may want to leave theenvironment and resources intact, providing them withtheir livelihoods and spiritual links to their ancestors. Indigenous Peoples have specific rights relevant for forest- based projects. The rights and concerns of Indige- nous Peoples have been internationally recognized, fore-most through International Labour Organization (ILO)Convention 169. The convention affirms the way of life ofindigenous and tribal peoples, recognizes the need to safe-guard their customary rights to land and natural resources,and stresses that they should benefit equally from economicand social development and that they and their traditionalorganizations should be closely involved in the planningand implementation of development projects that affect them. Specifically concerning biodiversity and sustainable nat- ural resource management, Agenda 21, adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Develop- ment (UNCED) in 1992, as well as the Rio Declaration, rec- ognize the actual and potential contributions of indigenousand tribal peoples to sustainable development. The 1992Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) calls on con-tracting parties to respect tr aditional indigenous knowledge with regard to the preservation of biodiversity and its sus- tainable use. The CBD has been a key vehicle for enhancingIndigenous Peoples' rights to their resources and their par-ticipation in biodiversity conservation and management.Indigenous Peoples are represented in the Conference of Parties of the CBD, which recognizes traditional knowledge and cultural heritage as conservation values. In October 2007, the United Nations' General Assembly adopted the UN Declaration on the Rights of IndigenousPeoples. The declaration, while nonbinding, sets interna-tional standards for the protection and promotion of theindividual and collective rights of Indigenous Peoples,including their rights to land and natural resources, andadvocates a human rights-based approach to developmentas it applies to Indigenous Peoples. These and other international conventions and agree- ments, along with the World Bank's Indigenous Peoples pol- icy (OP 4.10), provide an important context for WorldBank-assisted, forest- related projects affecting IndigenousPeoples. Through OP 4.10, the World Bank recognizes therights of Indigenous Peoples as addressed in internationaland national law and agreements. The policy acknowledgesthe vital role that Indigenous Peoples play in sustainabledevelopment, and calls for special considerations whenprojects affect the close ties that they have to land, forests,water, wildlife, and other natural resources. Specifically forprojects supporting parks and protected areas, the policystates that the World Bank \"recognizes the significance of 39Indigenous Peoples and ForestsNOTE 1.3[Indigenous Peoples'] rights of ownership, occupation, or usage, as well as the need for long- term sustainable man-agement of critical ecosystems\" (OP 4.10 paragraph 21). OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement also includes provisions for participatory natural resource management as well asmitigation measures for impacts from involuntary restric-tions of access to legally designated parks and protectedareas. (See section II of this sourcebook for more guidance on application of the World Bank's safeguard policies.) Forestry projects, including policy- based lending, invest- ment projects, and other types of projects affecting forestareas where Indigenous Peoples live, are particularly sensi-tive given the special relationship between Indigenous Peo- ples and their lands and natural resources. Forests can play a vital role in relation to livelihoods, sustainability of cul-tures, and development of Indigenous Peoples. In turn,Indigenous Peoples represent important stakeholders in thesustainable management of forest areas, and their involve-ment entails a range of challenges and opportunities thatneed careful assessment, often in a site- specific context.Finally, forest projects, if not properly designed and imple-mented, can have a variety of adverse impacts on the liveli-hoods and cultures of Indigenous Peoples. It is thus essen-tial that any forest- related project in areas with IndigenousPeoples thoroughly assess and address any issues pertaining to them and involve consultation with these communities. OPERATIONAL ASPECTS A key aspect of forest activities involving Indigenous Peo- ples is to acknowledge that development practitionersshould not assume that indigenous world views about land and natural resources, as well as development priorities, are the same as those that may be commonly held by govern-ment and development agencies. The analysis of andapproach to development in indigenous contexts must,therefore, take into consideration the specific understand- ing of the natural world among Indigenous Peoples and bebased on meaningful consultation with, and participationof, local communities. Indigenous Peoples' Relationship to Land and Natural Resources. Indigenous Peoples' special relationship with their lands and natural resources oftenmakes them vulnerable to development efforts. The specialrelationship that Indigenous Peoples have with their landand natural resources, along with their historicalmarginalization, may also result in significant impacts fromdevelopment activities, which, again, may vary substantiallyfrom those on other rural communities. Indigenous Peoples historically have experienced unequal and inequitabledevelopment and have frequently been economically,politically, and socially marginalized. They often lackentitlements in national legislation and development processes as well as respect for their cultures, lifestyles,livelihood models, and natural resource management practices. Moreover, Indigenous Peoples are often present in, and claim ownership of, areas with rich forest and other naturalresources, leading to potential conflicts over such resources.They may endure proportionally high impacts fromincreased pressures on the land and resources as a result ofdevelopment interventions as well as from general trends ofagricultural expansion and resource extraction. In additionto the risk of losing land and access to natural resources, thelanguages, world views, social organization, cultures, andvalues of Indigenous Peoples are in danger of further ero-sion or disappearance when development interventions failto recognize the close link between Indigenous Peoples andtheir lands and natural resources. Forest- based projects and programs should be planned with these opportunities, differences, and risks in mind. They require special attention and measures to ensure thatthe unique ties between Indigenous Peoples and their landsare given full weight in the design of projects and programs.This may result in specific activities to support and protectIndigenous Peoples' rights and well- being, developed in consultation with the affected communities. Use of policy analysis in investment and policy lending. World Bank operations, both investment and policy lending, involving forests and Indigenous Peoples require careful policy analysis. This analysis frequently identifiesreform initiatives that would improve the overall policyframework. Key policy issues for Indigenous Peoples include tenure, harvest and marketing policies, governance issues,fiscal policies, decentralization, attitudes of the dominantculture toward forest uses, environmental and social policies,and technical guidelines. Some of these are discussed below(see also chapter 6, Mainstreaming Forests into DevelopmentPolicy and Planning: Assessing Cross- Sectoral Impacts). Tenure not only of forest land but also of rights to the use of forest products . Indigenous Peoples' cultural attitudes toward claims of natural resource ownership and associ- ated stewardship responsibilities are important, as are considerations involving individual versus communityforms of tenure, and existence of and requirements for 40 CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTIONtenure adjudication and documentation. Policy analysis of tenure issues also needs to take into consideration thebroader political economy and phasing of policies or institutions affecting the sector (see further discussion on tenure below). Harvesting and marketing of forest products . Where com- munities in forest areas are interested in economic use of forest products, the objective of harvest and marketing policies should be to maximize returns from forest prod- ucts to Indigenous Peoples and other forest- dependentcommunities on an environmentally and fiscally sustain-able basis (see note 1.5, Making Markets Work for the Forest- Dependent Poor, for points on what policy reform should address). Governance . Governance policies on transparency, accountability, grievance mechanisms, and independent review modalities are important to forest operations involving Indigenous Peoples. Forest- rich countries, where forest resources are being \"mined\" or exploitedextensively and exported, often involve significant rent- seeking and revenue leakage. Efforts to address thesechallenging governance issues and associated vested interests can be especially beneficial to most IndigenousPeoples in forest areas, and inattention to these issues canbe especially harmful (see chapter 5, Improving ForestGovernance). Fiscal policies . Government services and programs target- ing Indigenous Peoples in remote forest areas are often poorly funded. In addition, the unit cost of service pro- vision is frequently higher, and there is limited availabil- ity of expertise tailored for Indigenous Peoples contexts.Public expenditure review and reform should addressthese problems caused by market and policy distortions,streamlining fund flow mechanisms, adjusting budget parameters, providing incentive payments, and correct-ing incentive distortions where necessary (see note 5.4,Strengthening Fiscal Systems in the Forest Sector). Community institutions and decentralization . Policies on indigenous community institutions are important to CBFM. Where indigenous communities are culturally homogeneous with strong social cohesion, key issues usually involve the extent to which the official structurereflects and acknowledges traditional decision- makingsystems and the extent of delegated authority and auton-omy. Where they involve heterogeneous groups and interests, institutional systems and decentralizationefforts also need to include effective modalities to nego-tiate the differing perspectives and relative levels of empowerment.Values and attitudes of mainstream culture . Some coun- tries regulate forest use based on the attitudes and values of the mainstream culture in ways that do not accom- modate traditional uses by Indigenous Peoples. Typical issues of contention include communal ownership,recognition or nonrecognition of sacred sites in forestareas, regulation or prohibition of hunting, and prohibi-tion of shifting cultivation. Policy reforms may be needed to recognize, and improve the level of under-standing by the majority culture of, Indigenous Peoples'resource use and management practices. Improvementsin traditional practices that enhance sustainability andnatural resources while still recognizing Indigenous Peo- ples' rights and cultures may be contemplated. Use of sector analysis in investment and policy lending. Sector analysis on Indigenous Peoples and forests may provide useful information and dialogue opportunitiesto inform investment and policy lending. The interactions ofIndigenous Peoples and forests have been increasingly takeninto consideration as part of broader country economic andsector analysis and the development of country assistancestrategies. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG,formerly the Operations Evaluation Department) hasincluded Indigenous Peoples issues in forest sector country case studies for Brazil (Uma and others 2000), India (Kumarand others 2000), and Indonesia (Gautam and others 2000),all noting the importance of access to land and naturalresources for Indigenous Peoples. More recently, analyticalefforts have also been associated with poverty reductionstrategies, as well as World Bank-wide reviews andformulations of strategies on forests, rural development,environment, and Indigenous Peoples. The degree of focuson forests and Indigenous Peoples has varied considerablyacross countries, depending on their relative extent andimportance, the receptivity of governments to policydialogue on these issues, World Bank staff expertise andcapacity, and the concern and commitment of regional Bankmanagement relative to other development issues. However,given the important role that Indigenous Peoples can play inthe forest sector, and the risks to which they may be exposed,it is essential that forest sector analysis include analysis ofIndigenous Peoples for countries where they are present. Informed participation of Indigenous Peoples. Informed consultation with and participation of Indigenous Peoples are essential for successful forest- based activities. Their particularrights, circumstances, and needs often render standarddevelopment approaches and assumptions inadequate or NOTE 1.3: INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND FORESTS 41inappropriate. Thus, development projects affecting Indigenous Peoples need to be prepared in full consultationwith affected communities and their informed participation should be ensured during project implementation (see OP 4.10, paragraph 1, and chapter 12, Applying OP 4.10 onIndigenous Peoples, in section II of this sourcebook). IEG evaluations of community participation in World Bank-assisted projects have found that when primary stakeholders\u2014 individuals and community- based organizations\u2014 participate in World Bank activities, devel-opment relevance and outcomes improve. Project- supported activities tend to be more sustainable, and thereis less corruption because processes are more transparent and government officials are held accountable to the people they serve (World Bank OED 2001, 2005). Specific benefitsconcerning Indigenous Peoples include the following: Project development recognizes Indigenous Peoples' rights to be consulted on, and participate in, develop-ment efforts that affect them, whether positively or adversely. Participation increases the likelihood of active engage- ment by affected communities and community owner-ship of project activities. Indigenous Peoples are enabled to make informed deci-sions on projects that will affect them. Project design and implementation are based on the real-ities of particular communities and their involvementwith forest- related project activities, and the project is more likely to provide culturally appropriate benefits. Consulting with Indigenous Peoples can be demanding and time consuming. The consultation process should include participatory methodologies to ensure participation and voice of marginalized social groups within affected communities, tobuild community consensus, to enhance transparency, and toensure local ownership of the process (see box 1.15). Use oftraditional decision- making processes that are familiar to localcommunities, along with skilled facilitation and capacity- building activities, will usually enhance the process and out- come (see chapter 10, Consultation and Communications inForest Activities, in section II of this sourcebook). Mechanisms for ongoing participation of Indigenous Peoples. Detailed arrangements for ongoing participation of Indigenous Peoples and OP 4.10 complaint mechanismsshould be included in project design. Local communities'participation must be clearly spelled out in projectpreparation and implementation plans, describing the rolesand responsibilities of various stakeholders (see chapter 12,Applying OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples, in section II of thissourcebook). Activities to build the capacity of localcommunities to participate may be necessary. In projectsinvolving Indigenous Peoples and forests, communication andconflict management measures help to build understanding, 42 CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTIONThis project, aiming to empower local communi- ties to better manage their natural resources, usedinnovative methods to consult with affected Indigenous Peoples during project preparation. Initially, an interinstitutional committee, includ-ing representatives from government, NGOs, andacademia began working on project design withIndigenous Peoples. A two- phased approach was developed to carry out consultations in a way thatfacilitated the communities' informed participa-tion in designing the project. For the first phase,expert facilitators already familiar with the specificindigenous groups were contracted to develop dis-semination materials together with indigenous students and to visit villages to present the project and the ideas for working with Indigenous Peo-ples. This laid a solid foundation for understand-ing the proposed project and activities specifically for Indigenous Peoples. The second phase of the consultations was a series of larger formal meetings between representa-tives selected by the Indigenous Peoples, in the loca-tion of their choice, with representatives of the proj-ect staff. Thanks to the initial field work thatdisseminated project information using culturallyappropriate methods, including indigenous lan-guages and specially designed graphics, the formal meetings were very productive. The Indigenous Peo-ples' representatives had had information and timeneeded to better understand the project, to formtheir opinions, and to make suggestions and recom-mendations for project design. As a result, theIndigenous Peoples felt their voices had been heard,and project staff received detailed feedback on howbest to reflect Indigenous Peoples' concerns in theproject design and Indigenous Peoples DevelopmentPlan (the project was prepared under OD 4.20). Source: Authors' compilation using World Bank 2002a.Box 1.15 Brazil Santa Catarina Natural Resource Management and Rural Poverty Reduction Projectmanage expectations, and address grievances. Given the range and variation of stakeholders, this frequently involves thedevelopment and implementation of a communication strategy that takes into account various audiences, culturally appropriate forms of communication, and provisions for two- way communication flows. Conflict management involvescapacity and skill development. Grievance proceduresfrequently build on existing mechanisms and consideration of informal customary mechanisms is particularly important. Indigenous Peoples' organizations, NGOs, academics, and others with appropriate experience and skills may play animportant facilitation role in developing participatoryprocesses and addressing social and environmental concerns related to Indigenous Peoples. If appropriate Indigenous Peo- ples' organizations or local NGOs cannot be identified, it maybe necessary to consider arranging for services from nationalor international Indigenous Peoples' organizations or NGOs,building the capacity of existing local Indigenous Peoples'organizations and NGOs, or hiring consultants with compa-rable skills. It is important to be aware of external organiza-tions that may claim to represent Indigenous Peoples and toconfirm their legitimacy and acceptance by the affected com-munities. Irrespective of the entity contracted, it is importantthat it is acceptable to the affected communities, and is able tofacilitate trust and cooperation. Good communication, coor- dination arrangements, and strategies that encourage ongo-ing learning and evolution in relationships will be key to suc-cessful partnerships with Indigenous Peoples' organizations,NGOs, and other civil society institutions. Social assessments in project design for Indigenous Peoples and forests. Detailed social assessment of issues pertaining to Indigenous Peoples and forests is needed toinform project design. Forest projects provide opportunitiesas well as risks for Indigenous Peoples. These should beassessed thoroughly during project preparation, as part of thesocial assessment and as part of free, prior, and informedconsultation processes, and addressed in project design andthe design and implementation instruments used to addressIndigenous Peoples' concerns. The specific relationshipbetween Indigenous Peoples and the environment in theproject area should be investigated, including aspects ofnatural resource use practices that may enhance or diminishbiodiversity and natural resources, keeping in mind thatsometimes assumptions about such practices can bemisguided, politically motivated, or based on values of thedominant cultural model rather than the reality in specificsituations. It is important that interventions be based onreliable facts obtained with the participation of localcommunities and through field- based biological and social assessments. The social issues concerning Indigenous Peoples and forests are extensive and complex. Key issues include rights to, and conflicts over, forest resources, local livelihoods and nat-ural resource management practices, social organization andsociocultural diversity, indigenous knowledge, gender andintergenerational issues, social and political risks, and vulner- abilities of local communities. (See World Bank 1997, WorldBank 2005, and section II of this Sourcebook for more detailson social analysis in natural resource management projects.) Institutional and stakeholder analysis. Institutional and stakeholder analysis helps identify opponents and proponents of project activi ties. It also identifies norms, rules, and behavior that may enhance or hinder successfulproject implementation. Forest management involvesmultiple stakeholder interests. In most countries, balancingcompeting interests and objectives is and will remain aconstant challenge in forest management. While often onecan find \"win- win\" solutions, at other times addressingthese various interests involves inherent tradeoffs andsignificant risks to project outcomes. The interests, values, capacities, and dependency on for- est resources of Indigenous Peoples' communities vary. There can be a variety of indigenous groups or subgroupsthat have different experiences and capabilities in forestmanagement. Levels of cultural homogeneity, social cohe-sion, social inclusion, familiarity with and managementskills in a cash economy, ability to defend interests in forests,and forest management practices may vary. All these differ-ences lead to different priorities regarding forest manage-ment that have to be negotiated and addressed in projectdesign and implementation. Adding to this complexity,many Indigenous Peoples today live in mixed communitiestogether with, or in close proximity to, other social groups. Recognizing customary tenure systems. Community resource management mechanisms under customary tenure systems are recognized as having great potential in helpingmitigate negative social and environmental impacts ofdevelopment. Customary tenure is supported throughgrowing recognition of legitimate rights to land and naturalresources of Indigenous Peoples and other forest- dependentcommunities (see also note 1.4, Property and Access Rights). Indigenous customary tenure structures are generally communal, indigenous rights are usually collective rights,and Indigenous Peoples more often than not claim someform of collective tenure. Separating indigenous commu- NOTE 1.3: INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND FORESTS 43nity territory into individual plots, which may be attempted through forest and land use planning exercises, runs the riskof adversely affecting the livelihoods and social cohesion of indigenous communities. (See, for example, the Asian Development Bank- financed poverty assessment for LaoPDR [State Planning Committee 2000].) Individual tenurearrangements should be developed with care and only withthe informed participation of the local communities. Importance of land and long- term resource use rights. Most Indigenous Peoples see resource use tenure as essential for their livelihoods and cultural survival. Landtenure and long- term access to natural resources areessential for forest- related projects that affect IndigenousPeoples. Lack of, or insecure, tenure or short- term tenure oruse rights arrangements are likely to prevent positive projectoutcomes and intensify degradation of forests. In contrast,secure land tenure and long- term tenure arrangements arelikely to empower local communities to manage forests insustainable ways. While international law recognizes Indigenous Peoples' rights to ancestral land and natural resources, and somecountries have begun to recognize these rights in nationallaw, the situation is far from uniform. Many countries inLatin America (for example, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Mex- ico, and Nicaragua) and the Philippines have assignedIndigenous Peoples large territories or enacted legislationrecognizing their rights. Most other countries do not legallyrecognize indigenous land and resource use rights, and thosethat do, do not always protect such rights in practice. The sit-uation is compounded by the fact that most indigenous areashave never been demarcated or titled, or lack documentationof such official conventions. Accordingly, ancestral lands aswell as areas of current occupation and resource use (if thesediffer) are often without legal recognition or protection. Forest- based projects should support land and long- term resource use rights of Indigenous Peoples where relevant. Incountries with legislation supporting Indigenous Peoples' landand resource use rights, projects should incorporate activitiesthat formalize and regularize them. Where the customarylands of Indigenous Peoples are legally under the domain ofthe state, or where it is otherwise inappropriate to convert tra-ditional rights into those of legal ownership, alternativearrangements should be implemented to grant long- term,renewable rights of custodianship and use of forest areas toIndigenous Peoples (see OP 4.10 for more details). WhereIndigenous Peoples are weak relative to private commercialinterests, it may be useful to combine government ownershipof forests with use rights to forest products for IndigenousPeoples. Such a combination could help to protect Indigenous Peoples' interests as well as prevent conversion of forest land tononforest uses in the short term. As needed, legal reforms should also be supported to enhance the recognition of land and resource use rights of Indigenous Peoples. Historical and political context to addressing rights. T o address the land and resource use rights of IndigenousPeoples, it is important to understand the historical andpolitical context in the country and local area. IndigenousPeoples have varying cultural values regarding tenure overforest land and forest products that need to be understood andaddressed in project design. The belief system of someIndigenous Peoples does not encompass the concept of naturalresource \"ownership\" at all, which can affect the way theyaddress customary tenure claims and rights as well as dailymanagement of resources. Views on individual and collectivetenure also vary. The extent to which tenure rights are linked tostewardship responsibilities also varies from group to group. Historical, cultural, and socioeconomic studies combined with participatory methods and community mapping exer-cises can help build a good understanding of local communi-ties, their cultures, resource use, and customary land andresource tenure arrangements. They may also help to buildtrust and avoid conflicts over land and resource use, providedthat findings are incorporated into project design, including measures that recognize Indigenous Peoples' customaryrights and continued access to sustainable resource use. Use of partnerships for enhancing protection and sustainability. In the context of CBFM, work with Indigenous Peoples to enhance efforts to manage forestresources. Building efforts on current relationships betweenthe environment and Indigenous Peoples can lead to win- win situations that enhance the protection of biodiversityand natural resources and at the same time support thecultures and sustainable livelihoods of local communities(see chapter 9, Applying Forests Policy OP 4.36, and chapter12, Applying OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples, in section II ofthis sourcebook, and note 1.2, Community- Based ForestManagement). Experience has shown that true partnerships are difficult to attain for various reasons, such as continued focus on top- down approaches, conflicting interests, corruption, andlimited capacity. Despite such difficulties, however, collabo-rative arrangements are gaining ground quickly becausethey can help resolve conflicts, foster learning during imple-mentation, enhance management of forest resources andbiodiversity, and support the livelihoods and cultures of 44 CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTIONlocal communities. They require time, resources, and a flex- ible approach that recognizes that while consensus is a use-ful goal, conflicts are likely to occur and management arrangements and grievance procedures should be enabled to address such conflicts. Collaborative arrangements andenhanced participation of local communities require capac-ity building as well as arrangements that institutionalizeparticipation and representation of local communities in decision- making processes and bodies. Indigenous knowledge as a basis for CBFM. Indigenous knowledge and management practices shouldbe the starting point for CBFM where appropriate.Indigenous Peoples' forest and natural resourcemanagement approaches vary in methods, complexity, andquality. Most often, though, Indigenous Peoples havemanaged natural resources soundly, providing theircommunities with food and other products withoutdepleting the resource base. Their knowledge and practicesshould be the starting point for project activities, incombination with modern approaches appropriate for thelocal context. (See box 1.16.) Human rights in forest certification. Certification schemes should include, in addition to sustainability principles, the rights of Indigenous Peoples. The voluntaryforest certification system should cover human rights,including rights of Indigenous Peoples to land, resources,and cultural sites as well as their free, prior, and informedconsent. This often goes beyond national forest regulations.(See chapter 11, Forest Certification Assessment Guide:Summary on Use, in section II of this sourcebook.) Importance of short- term and equitable benefits. Indigenous Peoples and other forest- dependent communitiesare likely to benefit from forest- related projects that addressthe issues discussed in this note. However, these benefits maymaterialize only in the long term if forestry production orimproved natural resource management practices areimplemented. In many cases, activities are needed to improvethe livelihoods of local communities and ensure equitablebenefits in the short term. These activities commonly consist of culturally appro- priate assistance in improving agricultural production, sus-tainable harvesting and processing (including organizationand legal recognition), market access, and the value of for-est products (for example, market studies, strategy develop-ment, and organization); and support to small businessesand to joint ventures selling cultural products or forest- based products, through employment in conservation activ-ities and through ecotourism. Improving forest- based livelihoods through better multi cropping in swidden cultivation fields and sustainableuse of nontimber forest products are useful approaches toproviding benefits to Indigenous Peoples. Experiments inmarkets for environmental services are under way andshould be extended to include Indigenous Peoples. TheWorld Bank's BioCarbon Fund (BiCF) may support forest- dependent communities in earning revenues through car-bon credits for planting and managing forests. Work is ongoing to extend the benefits to Indigenous Peo- ples of the newly established Forest Carbon Partnership Facil-ity (FCPF), which will support policy approaches and pro-grams with positive incentives for reducing emissions fromdeforestation and degradation. The facility will also developconcrete activities to reach out to poor people who depend onforests to improve their livelihoods. Ongoing efforts and con-sultations with Indigenous Peoples and forest- dependentcommunities are developing appropriate mechanisms toensure that these communities benefit from the FCPF. NOTE 1.3: INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND FORESTS 45This project aims to reduce rural poverty through improved forest management, with specific commu-nity participation by tribal forest- dependent com- munities to assume full responsibility for the devel- opment of forest areas. One of the three maincomponents is community development to improvevillage infrastructure and livelihoods, through for-est- and nonforest- based income- generation activi- ties. A tribal development plan is an integral sub-component in preparing investment proposals. Thetribal development plan includes activities to narrowthe gap in the levels of tribal and nontribal develop-ment through deliberate actions for tribal socioeco-nomic development. This includes community investments (for example, community halls, wells) and creation of wage labor, both for work within theprotected area (fire management, habitat restora-tion) and other conservation activities. At severalother protected areas in the country, specific pro-grams target tribal and special- needs groups: a tribaltrekkers program at Periyar, ropemaking skills atPench, and community agriculture at Gir.

Box 1.16 India Andhra Pradesh Community Forestry Management Project LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS The following summarizes lessons learned to date:1 T enure over land and resources is the most important element of Indigenous Peoples' survival and needs to beassessed and addressed in forest projects. Indigenous Peoples' rights to land and resources should be recog- nized and, if needed, appropriate legal frameworksshould be developed to guarantee such rights. Effective management of forest resources is best accom- plished through local participation. It should be built onfinding common ground, allowing sufficient time for mutual understanding and acceptance of goals and strategies, creating and maintaining transparencythroughout the process, and recognizing that goals willchange and that collaboration does not mean consensus. For Indigenous Peoples, survival is cultural survival. Forestry activities are a means toward that end, not anend in themselves. For example, the survival of local lan- guages is key to the maintenance of local ecological knowledge and values. Indigenous Peoples should partic-ipate in activities supporting their intellectual property rights and bioprospecting. T oo often, Indigenous Peoples have been seen only as laborers, park guards, or gatherers or producers of rawmaterials. Small businesses and joint ventures in which Indigenous Peoples retain an equity share in products as they move through the market chain should be supported. Efforts should be focused on sustainable timber manage- ment because ecotourism, nontimber forest products,bioprospecting, the sale of int ellectual property, or even the sale of carbon rights will not generate the same levels of income for Indigenous Peoples in the short tomedium term as logging. Alternative development efforts need to be designed to match or complement local skills. These efforts need toplace equal emphasis on income generation and sustain- able resource use in addition to addressing the steep learning curves of groups that are often only now enter-ing the market economy. Lessons have also been learned from Inspection Panel cases involving forest activities affecting Indigenous Peoples in Cambodia and Democratic Republic of Congo. These includethe need to (i) analyze the current situation of IndigenousPeoples, not only in project areas, but in the country as awhole, to assess ongoing support and outreach efforts, as well as to undertake dialogue on any policy or legal reforms thataffect them; (ii) identify early on any potential impacts on, and benefits to, Indigenous Peoples, including any special needsand targeted poverty reduction activities; (iii) ensure a well- developed plan for consultation and participation of affectedIndigenous Peoples and other forest- dependent communities;(iv) address adverse impacts from forest activities (for exam-ple, restrictions of access to, or logging in, areas of indigenousresource use and cultural sites), which may result equally frominvestment and policy lending activities; (v) undertake capacity- building activities in traditional and other sectorsthat are relevant to and that engage Indigenous Peoples. A number of Bank- assisted projects have supported forest- based activities with Indigenous Peoples' communities. The Brazil Indigenous Lands Project supported the conservationof natural resources in indigenous areas and the well- being ofIndigenous Peoples through regularization of indigenouslands in the Legal Amazon, and improved protection ofIndigenous Peoples and their land. It has been innovative inimproving technical quality and Indigenous Peoples' partici-pation in and control of the processes of regularizing, protect-ing, and managing their lands. A methodology for ethno- ecological assessments of indigenous lands was developed tocombine traditional knowledge with scientific informationand provide a practical and flexible tool for investigating human- environment interactions. Some of the challenges theproject confronted included securing involvement of the rightexperts; difficulties of organizing work in remote locationsand timing it with seasonal conditions; and institutional weak-nesses of Brazil's National Indian Foundation (FUNAI), theagency responsible for Indigenous Peoples. Involvement of multiple agencies, uncertainties concerning the legal aspects ofnatural resource use in Indigenous Peoples' areas, and conflictsbetween Indigenous Peoples and local and national stakehold-ers (for example, neighboring ranchers and conservation organizations) hampered progress on protecting IndigenousPeoples' lands and limited sustainable development efforts toenhance Indigenous Peoples' well- being (see World Bank 2007and Lisansky 2004). Lessons from the Colombia Natural Resource Management (NRM) Program, supporting improved natural resource man- agement through CBFM and land titling activities, includelocal participation in NRM activities takes time, often requir-ing changes in the overall climate between different groups; Indigenous Peoples' organizations can play a significant role inmonitoring the actions of government agencies; and collectiveland titling often faces resistance from government and otherstakeholders (see Clay, Alcorn, and Butler 2000). The Mexico Community Forestry Projects are excellent examples of the benefits that supporting CBFM activities 46 CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTIONwith Indigenous Peoples can offer. Sophisticated forest management, product processing, and marketing haveenhanced participating communities' livelihoods and improved natural resource management (box 1.17). Recommendations for future activities. This note has discussed some of the operational aspects and lessons learned concerning forest- based projects affecting Indigenous Peoples. These can be summarized into the following keyrecommendations for future forestry activities involvingIndigenous Peoples: Recognize Indigenous Peoples' rights to their land and natural resources, and to benefits from developmentactivities, as well as the need for consultation and partic- ipation throughout the planning, implementation, mon- itoring, and evaluation processes. Base project preparation and implementation on well- prepared and well- executed consultations with Indige-nous Peoples and sound social and institutional analysis providing a thorough understanding of the local context and affected communities. Ensure that project activities affecting Indigenous Peo- ples are based on a sound process of free, prior, andinformed consultations with affected communities lead- ing to broad community support.Support CBFM, emphasizing community ownership and collaborative arrangements (see note 1.2, Community- Based Forest Management). Support livelihood activities and ensure equitable bene-fits to affected Indigenous Peoples. Pay attention to the requirements of the Bank's IndigenousPeoples policy (OP 4.10) early on in project preparation,and make clear agreements with the borrower well before project appraisal. NOTE 1. T o inform the World Bank's Forest Policy Implementa- tion Review and Strategy Development Framework, an inde- pendent study was undertaken to assess how the Bank has addressed the issue of Indigenous Peoples in selected World Bank and GEF-funded forestry and biodiversity conservationprojects in Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, Papua New Guinea,and Siberia (Clay, Alcorn, and Butler 2000). The lessonslearned and recommendations are drawn from that study.

NOTE 1.3: INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND FORESTS 47The objectives of these two Community Forestry Projects(also titled PROCYMAF I and II) are to assist IndigenousPeoples' communities and ejidos (communal land own- ing units) in different priority regions of Mexico to improve the management and conservation of their for-est resources and to generate alternative sources ofincome in a sustainable manner. Lessons from these proj-ects suggest that community forestry is an effective instrument for sustainable rural development, buildingon existing local economic, social, and biophysical condi-tions and encompassing the development of social capi-tal (based on traditional forms of governance), a mini-mum base of natural capital (forest resources withcommercial value), and the development of technical and administrative capacity (human capital) at the com- munity level to enhance decision- making powers. The first project focused its community forestry activ-ities on diagnostics and participatory planning aimed at self- management, including the financing of Participa-tory Rural Appraisals, enabling indigenous communities to take a more active role in natural resource manage- ment decisions based on an improved understanding oftheir needs, capabilities, and interests. In this way theproject was successful in empowering local communitiesto improve management of their forest resources and expanding their options for income generation. While the first project helped increase the competi- tiveness of community forest enterprises and openedup new markets for certified forest products from Mex-ico, a key lesson learned was the need to include signif-icant funding for productive activities, particularly for processes that add market value to forest products and achieve economies of scale through community associ-ations and strategic partnerships with the private sector.Box 1.17 Mexico First and Second Community Forestry Projects Source: World Bank 2004.

Legal frameworks and rural land-usepolicies often discourage or deny local people's rights toown, use, and trade their forest products and services. Acurrent dilemma is the complementarity between these frameworks and policies and environmental laws and regu-lations, which may evolve with limited attention to tenureand rights implications. Development projects promoting agriculture expansion, large- scale irrigation, and industrial (and mining) develop- ment have often impinged on forest areas and forest inhab- itants. Often, indigenous and forest- dependent communi-ties do not directly benefit from these activities. Similarly,forestry projects that deal with industrial and logging con-cessions, government- controlled logging quotas, protectedarea enlargements, and plantation developments can, if notappropriately designed and planned, affect tenure and cus-tomary rights of indigenous and other forest communities.Most of these forestry projects affect traditional forest users,those with ancestral forest rights, shifting cultivators, andNTFP gatherers (such as in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet-nam). Operationally, it is difficult to avoid these undesirable impacts in absence of clarity on tenure and property rights(see note 1.3, Indigenous Peoples and Forests). Emerging payment schemes and markets for ecosystem services, such as water flow and biodiversity conservation,present both similar and special sets of issues for foresttenure and property rights. Unless done properly, poor peo-ple are less likely to participate in these markets because oftheir inability to assume risk, the lack of organization to cre-ate economies of scale, limited land and investment capital,and often unclear property and use rights. These emergingmarkets can be a means for government and local commu-nities to enhance forest rights in a pilot watershed credits or a carbon credits scheme and provide complementary tech-nical support, as well as providing additional returns to poor producers managing forests on the margin. If not done sensitively, they can, however, also set dangerous precedentsby introducing new uncertainties\u2014 deeming shifting culti-vation or other traditional practices unacceptable, establish-ing long- term contracts in regions where forest tenure is contested, extinguishing traditional use and access, and rais-ing the price of forests beyond the reach of local people. Clearly defined rights are essential if the forest- dependent poor are to improve their income and well- being. If individuals, communities, and businesses are to invest in forest resources, take responsibility for their con- servation, and participate regularly and openly in the mar-ketplace, they need to be confident of their property rights.Growing evidence from around the world demonstratesthat recognizing local rights and improving local gover-nance is politically feasible. It is also a cost- effective strategyfor rural poverty alleviation. Emerging trends show that more countries are now actively engaged in reforming their forest land and manage-ment practices. Many communities and Indigenous Peoplesare asserting their rights to manage their forests, and somegovernments are introducing substantive changes to forest tenure and to policies and rules governing markets, and link-ing these to agrarian and related sector policies. The forestsector is now undergoing important reforms, arguably themost important set of policy and market shifts since the endof the colonial era, and these present historic opportunitiesfor, and sometimes threats to, the well- being\u2014 livelihoods,rights, freedom and choices, and culture\u2014 of the 1.6 billionpoor people who live in and around forests. These reformsaffect the way in which forest people manage and conserveforests and affect the provisioning of forest environmentalgoods and services that benefit society as a whole. 49Property and Access RightsNOTE 1.4In what are considered public forest lands, there has been recognition of community or collective and individual property rights in some forests, including special rights of Indigenous Peoples, and elaboration of comanagement arrangements for other public forests. Complementary tointroducing reforms in forest and land tenure, governmentsacross the world are now beginning to reassess legal and reg-ulatory frameworks and the way in which they allocate sub- sidies, provide privileged access to publicly owned forests,and monitor the resulting impacts. Many countries are alsoengaged in a process of decentralization. In Canada, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nicaragua, and the Philippines, recognition of indigenous and community rights has at times been the subject of major national debate and conflict, though each country has also had examples ofnotable progress in dealing with these issues. Similar issueshave occurred in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala,Honduras, and Peru. In many of these countries significantforest areas have been recognized as indigenous territoriesor reserves, and increasing areas of public forest are consid-ered for community concessions. One of the most recentnotable advances can be found in Guatemala. Designation of public forests as community forest is expanding in Africa\u2014 as in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, TheGambia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe\u2014 but effective handover has beenextremely limited, either by severely degraded forests orunder institutional arrangements that are impractical orconflict with local organization. Even in countries with themost extensive forest areas in public concessions\u2014 Canada,Cambodia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic ofCongo, Lao PDR, and the Russian Federation\u2014 tenureshifts are under discussion. China's allocation of more than100 million hectares of collective forests, and plantationsuccess in these forests, supports deepening of collectiverights and extending favorable policies to local communities. OPERATIONAL ASPECTS There are multiple dimensions to tenure security, which go beyond the simple recognition of property rights. Policieshave failed to differentiate between tenure to recognize the nuances of private, public, collective, and common prop- erty, and open access (see box 1.18). Often, government sta-tistics on land ownership mask or distort reality, leading todisregard for important property and use rights and tenurepatterns, or poorly designed regulatory frameworks and permit controls.Devolution of rights. Devolution of rights to forest land and resources is severely impeded in many places by the remnants of colonial legal frameworks and by a systemof subsidies and incentives; these need serious reform iftenure rights are to become meaningful to poor forestcommunities. Some operational steps to consider incooperation with client governments include the following: reforming models of forest conservation to genuinely include populations living in and around protected areas considering and recognizing grazing rights and otheragropastoral systems in forested landscapes reforming adverse systems of direct and indirect subsi-dies to plantations, industry, and intermediate marketingagents, which have adversely affected local producers and community enterprises reconsidering regulations that impede forest smallhold- ers' entry into markets and that impose costly procedures(see note 1.5, Making Markets Work for the Forest- Dependent Poor) Multiple Characteristics of Tenure Security. Te nu re security has multiple characteristics, especially in the case of common property (see box 1.19). Institutional gaps can undo otherwise positive tenure reform (as was seen inCameroon and Ghana) if permitted legal forms ofcommunity forests are complex, and customary or informalarrangements are seldom recognized, resulting in fewcommunities effectively taking over management. Analysis of tenure status, access rights, and use rights. T enure is in transition in many developing countries. Particularly where land administration reformand land reform are ongoing, a gap can develop betweenthe forest tenure dialogue and the overall landadministration dialogue. Effective projects in suchsituations must be based on analysis of tenure status, accessrights, and use rights. Such an analysis must be sensitive tothe variety of tenure arrangements that exist between thetwo extremes of pure public property and pure privateproperty. For example, a number of indigenous use arrangements and rights regimes coexist with the total stateownership of forest resources on paper. In a number ofplaces the state has devolved partial to substantial use rightsto communities without changing the status of propertyownership, while in others communities exercisesubstantial control of the resource without staterecognition. Each of these variations in tenure offers a 50 CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTIONdifferent set of opportunities for communities to use and protect their resources with varying outcomes (figure 1.1). While government statistics and information available from land administrations are usually a good starting point, greater insights concerning evidence of historical use anddependence, as well as customary laws and rights, are oftengathered through participatory mapping.Importance of pilots. Pilot activities can be important to expanding the range of possibilities, demonstrating the viability of rights- based forestry approaches to improve livelihoods, generate income, or advance conservation. The objective is to build on a multisectoral analysis of foresttenure and access without limiting the recognition ordevolution of rights where reform is ongoing. NOTE 1.4: PROPERTY AND ACCESS RIGHTS 51Property rights can be viewed as reflective of social rela- tions. Property rights are rules that govern relationsbetween individuals with respect to property and they should therefore be defined by the community or the state to which such individuals belong. Property rightsneed to be clearly defined, well understood, andaccepted by those who have to abide by them\u2014 andstrictly enforced. Property rights need not always confer full \"ownership\" and be individual; depending on thecircumstances it may be best if they are bestowed on theindividual, in common, or to the general public. Mostimportant for sustainable development is that propertyrights are deemed secure (van den Brink et al. 2006). No single typology of tenure or property rights is universally accepted. Some typologies distinguishbetween legal tenure and customary tenure, othersbetween de facto and de jure rights, while others distin- guish among property regimes. Property rights are alsooften seen as a bundle of rights that include the right toaccess and withdraw, manage, exclude, and alienate(Schlager and Ostrom 1992). Legal tenure is recognized as legitimate under the policies and laws of the state, while customary tenure isrecognized as legitimate by the traditions and customsof a society but has not been formally codified in thelaw. Customary tenure systems exist in many countrieswith significant populations of rural poor, where land allocation and use are determined through long- standing \"customary\" methods that, in many coun-tries, operate outside the formal legal system. Such cus-tomary tenure systems are dominant in manyindigenous areas where traditional social structures arelargely intact. Customary systems are associated withtraditional land administration institutions and cus-tomary laws that define how rights are governed, allo-cated, and preserved. The systems are effective becausethey respond to a community's social, cultural, andeconomic needs and because they are enforced by localleadership. Customary tenure systems typically possess both collective and individual dimensions. In part, thecollective aspect relates to the community as compared with outsiders. Internally, the collective element relates to community land and resources, while the individualdimension concerns transactions, successions, andexchanges of family plots between community mem-bers. While it is reasonable to consider that both col- lective and individual tenure have their place in forestactivities, introducing individual tenure from outsideincludes risks. There are cases where customary rights have been legitimized but are still identified as customary rights.In such cases, the term \"customary\" helps identify the origin of the right. De jure rights are given lawful recognition by formal, legal instrumentalities, while de facto rights are rights that resource users continuously work cooperatively to design and enforce. A common typology of property rights distin- guishes among private, common, and public or state property rights: Private property rights - individual or \"legal individual\" holds most if not all the rights - property can be leased under a contract to a third party Common property rights- group (for example, community) holds rights- group can manage property and exclude others - rules are important to manage and distribute resource Public property or state property rights State holds the bundle of rights Open access results from the ineffective exclusion of nonowners by the entity assigned formal rights of ownership.Box 1.18 Typology of Property Rights Source: Authors' compilation using Molnar and Khare (2006) and Jensby (2007).Participation in commercial markets. The ability of forest rights holders to manage and make use of their resources is linked to their level of, and opportunities for, participation in commercial markets (see note 1.5, Making Markets Work for the Forest- Dependent Poor). Forest tenurecannot be analyzed in isolation from world market trends,which both drive demand and create pressures on existingforest regimes. Newly created market opportunities for poor forest producers and forest owners can only be realized if theblend of tenure and other policies and regulations create theenabling environment. Changing long- established patternsof governance and industrial behavior inevitably entails adegree of political, economic, and environmental risk and adjustments in forest product supply and demand. Clear and secure tenure rights are necessary but not sufficient toengender these changes. Experience in Papua New Guineashows that local landowners failed to manage enterprises forthe long term when short- term returns were not highenough to encourage a change in behavior. Furthermore,technical and organizational support in early stages isessential. Mexican ejidos and communities have faced strong market competition from imports and subsidies to private plantations, requiring stronger enterprises and more flexible forest regulations to survive. Assistance in meeting these challenges will determine whether development and forestinvestments have pro- poor outcomes (box 1.20). LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS The transition to greater forest tenure and property rights occurs through a varied combination of strategies\u2014 bothreforms fostered by political elites and bottom- up reforms demanded by civil society and community organizations. Development organizations have enabled reform processesthrough PRSP dialogue, but unless well linked to organicprocesses of civil society and empowered decentralization,these usually fail to make timely changes. Lessons from a variety of countries on successful strategies for change arelisted in box 1.21. 52 CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTIONCommunity development and training organizations Organizational skills Conflict resolution Business managementGovernment agencies Legal framework Implementing Dispute resolutionPolicy groups Inform decision making Public education LobbyingResearcher Mapping Information disseminationPublic law groups Legal cases Training locals Dispute resolutionActivists and NGOs Mobilizing Demarcating Planning Tenure security Judiciary or arbitrator Legal recognitionRegulatory mechanisms Property rights Internal institutionsPolitical constituencyFigure 1.1 T oward T enure Security: Ellsworth and 2004, Ellsworth 2004.NOTE 1.4: PROPERTY AND ACCESS RIGHTS 53Security of community tenure encompasses a number of characteristics: 1.Requires that there is clarity as to what the rights are . Confusion about one's rights can significantly undermine the effectiveness and enthusiasm withwhich rights are exercised. 2.Requires certainty that rights cannot be taken away or changed unilaterally and unfairly . In almost any sit- uation, of course, there are circumstances where itmay be appropriate for rights to be taken away ordiminished, but conditions for doing so need to befair and clearly spelled out, the procedures fair andtransparent, and compensation addressed. 3.Is enhanced if the duration of rights is either in perpe-tuity or for a clearly spelled- out period that is longenough for the benefits of participation to be fullyrealized . If rights are to be in force only temporarily\u2014 as in some comanagement arrange-ments or community forestry leases\u2014 care shouldbe taken to ensure that agreements are at least aslong as is realistically required to reap the appropri-ate degree of benefits. 4.Means that rights need to be enforceable against thestate (including local government institutions)\u2014 that is, the legal system has to recognize an obliga- tion of the state to respect those rights. 5.Requires that the rights be exclusive . The holders of rights need to be able to exclude outsiders or control the access of outsiders to the resource over whichthey have \"rights.\" A corollary to exclusivity is thatthere must be certainty both about the boundaries of the resources to which rights apply and aboutwho is entitled to claim group membership. A sec-ond corollary to exclusivity where comanagementconcerns government land is that the governmententity entering into the agreement must have clearauthority to do so, authority that the responsible entity is empowered to fulfill. 6.Requires that the law recognizes the holder of the rights . The law should provide a way for the holder of the rights to acquire a legal personality, with thecapacity to apply for credits and subsidies, enterinto contracts with outsiders, collect fees, and so forth. 7.Requires accessible, affordable, and fair avenues forseeking protection of the rights, for solving disputes, and for appealing decisions of government officials.Box 1.19 Characteristics of Secure Community Te n u re Source : Lindsay 1998.

The following topics should be considered in PRSPs and in project identification and design: Overall land tenure, zoning, and land use arrangements have an impact on sound forest management and forest access for the poor. Particular attention should be paid tooverlapping areas for private land adjudication and publicor communal forests in frontier regions, and overlappingrights to Indigenous Peoples' lands and territories for above- soil and subsoil resources. Patterns of ownershipshould be mapped before project implementation, andinstruments for resolving conflicts extra- legally or legallyshould be considered. T enure and policy frameworks create incentives or disin- centives for forestry management, and control forest andforest market access for low- income producers. T o mini-mize the harmful consequences of these frameworks on the forest- dependent poor, interventions should avoid regula-tory frameworks that inadvertently place high burdens onthe poor; tax and tariff polices that distort market partici-pation; environmental regulations that low- income produc-ers cannot afford to comply with, and therefore become\"criminals\" by ignoring; and barriers to low- income pro-ducers from outside the sector, such as small business regu-lations and lack of access to technical training or financialsupport. Existing and proposed protected- area regimes can support local rights and livelihoods by zoning for co -management and protecting local residents from incursionsby outsiders or extractive activities. They can hamper rights if overly restrictive or if they cause overlapping claims. Industrial and infrastructure subsidies, and indirect sub- sidies, to processing industries, plantations, and transport create an unequal playing field for small and medium enter-prises that do not qualify for such subsidies. Tax and tariffpolicies that affect domestic industry, imports, and exportscan also be key drivers of distortions. These and other mar- ket and trade trends should be analyzed, with special con-sideration for the overlap of informal markets and trade andconflicted forest resources claims, as well as the impacts of commercial- scale plantations on land ownership patterns. Ecosystem service payments or market schemes can offer opportunities to secure tenure for low- income producers as areward for sustainable resource management. However, pay-ment schemes must be carefully reviewed to ensure that exist-ing local tenure and resource use rights are not threatened. There are multiple mechanisms to monitor progress and influence the pace and quality of implementation of tenurereforms. These range from participatory monitoring toindependent outside review, and should assist in adjustingprocesses (through changes either in projects or in projectdesigns) to changing conditions over time. With devolution of responsibility to communities and low- income producers, dependency on outside profession- als must be reduced and local institutions and capacity forforest management must be strengthened. 54 CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTIONSupport anticorruption and justice reform activities at national levels, through local and national legal groups. Nurture local organizations to help them act moreeffectively as advocates, while helping them todevelop legal and mapping tools to better stake their claims. Support workshops on tenure where ideas are exchanged, and where lessons learned from the fieldcan be translated into ministerial priorities. Strengthen emerging leaders and organizations whorepresent communities or indigenous peoples byfostering learning and opportunities to discuss their issues directly with the government. Build successful field models, recognizing these require time and patience. Avoid promoting pilotmodels that represent the lowest common denomi- nator acceptable to government and undermine efforts at more meaningful reform. Mobilize civil society through effective activist and grassroots organizations with the capacity and willto champion a cause. Create linkages between local leaders at the globallevel, helping to sharpen their advocacy strategies. Support federations and associations in communi-ties that are attempting to exercise their tenurerights, and support NGOs to build informed grass- roots organizations.Box 1.21 Opportunities to Advance Community T enure Security: A Summary Source : Ellsworth and White 2004.

CROSS- REFERENCED CHAPTERS AND NOTES Note 1.3: Indigenous Peoples and Forests Note 1.5: Making Markets Work for the Forest- Dependent Poor NOTE 1.4: PROPERTY AND ACCESS RIGHTS 55Improving market access of forest- dependent commu- nities could enhance the contribution of forests to rurallivelihoods. With 25 percent of the world's forests cur- rently under community control, the expansion of agro- forestry, and the development of community forest planta-tions, indigenous and other small communities own morethan three times as much forest in developing countries asdo private firms and individuals (see chapter 3, Meeting the Growing Demand for Forest Products). This creates newopportunities in commercial forestry that could serve abroader vision of meeting demand for forest products andforest conservation in ways that also address the livelihoodneeds of rural poor low- income producers (see note 1.2, Community- Based Forest Management, and note 1.3, Indigenous Peoples and Forests). Furthermore, changes inmarket structure, new market instruments, and forest com-panies' new interests in business partnerships with localpeople are opening market niches for which local producershave or could develop a competitive advantage. Environ-mental sustainability concerns are also creating new mar-kets for certified forest products and environmental services. Low- income forest producers 1have potential competi- tive advantages for important segments of commercial for- est markets. Forest dwellers located near population centers have lower transport costs, are more familiar with local preferences, and have the flexibility to supply small quanti-ties of forest products as needed by local traders. Further-more, they have an advantage in branding for specialtymarkets, enabling them to target socially responsible mar- ket niches. For example, the Rainforest Alliance supportsBrazil nut- product organizations to enable them to accesssuch market niches. Community forest owners, comanagers of public forests, and farmers in forest- scarce locations near rapidly growing inland population centers can be competitive suppliers of commodity wood for construction and fuelwood. Further-more, community forest owners with high- quality, accessi-ble timber, strong community organization, and good mar-keting and management skills can profitably sell tropicalhardwoods as well, such as that sold from communityforests in certain regions of Mexico. High- value timber canalso be profitably sold by farmers from agroforestry sys-tems. Benefits can also be gained from certified wood mar-kets if there are established contracts or agreements withcertified wood users or market intermediaries. For example,in Brazil a pulp and paper company assists small- scalefarmer producer groups to obtain certification and to sup-ply the local furniture company demand (Scherr, White,and Kaimowitz 2003, 2004). Many local producers will benefit from preprocessing of forest products to reduce waste, increase quality, or reducetransportation costs, as well as from production of furni- ture and commodities for poor consumers in growing ruralor urban markets. Small- scale sawmilling will also be viablein markets where there is no competition with high- efficiency, industrial mills. Additionally, in densely settled, forest- scarce countries with large markets for pulp, farmers or communities near mills could supply industrial pulp-wood, especially on lower quality lands. Mondi Ltd. pulpand paper company in South Africa's Eastern Cape providestechnical assistance and start- up capital to communities organized in common property associations. NTFPs represent economic potential for those low- income producers or collectors of products with inelasticdemand. In Cameroon, the demand for some NTFPs has grown dramatically in the past two decades as a result ofincreasing urbanization and a growing international mar-ket. Innovative marketing arrangements for environmentalservices also offer a market niche for those forest dwellers inareas with high levels of biodiversity or other values such aswatershed protection or carbon sequestration (Scherr,White, and Kaimowitz 2003, 2004; also see note 2.3, Inno-Making Markets Work for the Forest- Dependent PoorNOTE 1.5 56vative Marketing Arrangements for Environmental Ser- vices). Historically, low- income producers have been at a disad- vantage in accessing markets, leading to a need to address this issue by jointly building on local human and naturalcapital assets, and building the institutional framework forgood governance and distributive aspects of growth overtime (see figure and Puntodewo2006). OPERATIONAL ASPECTS There are many opportunities for forest management mod- els to scale up the benefits they deliver for forest conserva-tion and the rural poor or low- income producers. However, large gaps exist in information and experience and there are major challenges in finding the right market niches, sup-porting local forest businesses, and reforming policies toenable profitable market participation by local people.Addressing these challenges will require coordinated action by governments, international institutions, conservationand development organizations, and community producerorganizations. Such action is necessary to level the playingfield for low- income producers and give them a real chanceto succeed. Two areas that would benefit from interventions in col- laboration with client governments are removal of policybarriers and development of forest businesses.Potential measures for removing policy barriers include the following (based on Scherr, White, and Kaimowitz 2003,2004; Sunderlin, Dewi, and Puntodewo 2006): Secure forest access and tenure rights of local people (see note 1.4, Property and Access Rights). Remove state monopolies and other controls on harvestand marketing that are common in several Bank clientcountries. However, decisions on the extent and phasing of deregulation need to carefully consider potential impacts on Indigenous Peoples and other forest- dependent communities and provide for capacity- building initiatives to avoid adverse effects and enhancetheir benefits from deregulation. Remove or revise regulatory barriers and excessive regu- lation that limits local forest producers from using theirown or public forests. For example, in some regions of India, 10 separate permits are required for community forest producers to complete a timber sale. In othercountries, indigenous communities have long- termrights to extensive tracts of natural forest, but they do nothave the right to commercially exploit them. Revoke policies that discriminate against small produc- ers (see box 1.22). For example, in Bolivia forest policyreforms have included formal recognition of indigenous groups' forest rights, lowered concession fees for small- scale forest producers, and simplified the process foraccessing municipal forests. Facilitate the creation of forest user associations or pro- ducer groups to create economies of scale and to increase NOTE 1.5: MAKING MARKETS WORK FOR THE FOREST - DEPENDENT POOR 57Outcomes Conserve, restore forest resourcesIncrease market supplyReduce povertyLocal people ecosystem servicesLocal \u007f Control of forest resources\u007f Lower costs structure \u007f Forest management capacity\u007f Lower supply risks\u007f Attractive to socially responsible marketsDevelop forest business \u007f Improve market position \u007f Strengthen producers\u007f Forge business partnerships \u007f Pursue new financing \u007f Encourage business service providers\u007f Establish enterprise development programs \u007f Target education and research Remove policy barriers \u007f Secure local rights \u007f Reduce regulatory burden\u007f \"Level playing field\" \u007f Involve producers in policy negotiations\u007f Protect the poorestFigure 1.2 Forest Market Development Strategy for Low- Income Producers Source : Scherr, White, and Kaimowitz 2004.bargaining power (see note 2.2, Small and Medium Enterprises). Actively involve local producers in forest policy negotia-tions with private industry, government agencies, andenvironmental groups to produce more practical, realis- tic, and lower cost laws, market regulations, and develop- ment plans. Create mechanisms that protect the poorest by, for example, ensuring that local forests retain their diversecultural roles and their safety net functions without sac- rificing others' potential income gains from commercial- ization of public forests. Potential measures for developing forest enterprises include the following (based on Scherr, White, and Kaimowitz 2003, 2004; Sunderlin, Dewi, and Puntodewo2006; USAID 2004): Improve the market position of small producers by enabling them to respond to consumer preferences andto develop market strategies. This may mean improving production and marketing technology, product quality. or reliability of supply. Examples include drying forestfruits to improve product quality or chemically treating rattan to prevent fungal damage and staining. Strengthen producer organizations through technical support and capacity building so that they can make cap-ital investments, pursue new sources of financing, engage in value- added processing, negotiate deals, and establish product- quality or conservation controls. Increase the contribution of commercially valuable NTFPs by enhancing community organization toincrease the market power of NTFP producers and processors and decrease their vulnerability to external shocks (see box 1.23); build capacity in the areas of tech-nical knowledge and organizational skills to ensureresource management and harvesting, domesticationwhere appropriate, and improved product processing; and build business capacity of potential entrepreneursand develop links between producer communities andfair trade organizations to improve marketing and addvalue to the products. Promote strategic partnerships between communities and businesses (see box 1.24 and note 2.1, Community- Private Partnerships). 58 CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTIONIn Honduras, a number of factors, including excessive regulation, disadvantage small- scale forest producers,forcing many into illegality. An estimated 80 percent of the timber trade in Honduras is illicit. Securing man- agement plans, harvesting permits, and commerciallicenses is costly. In addition to formal charges, appli-cants may need to make informal payments for offi-cials to facilitate the process. These, plus the costs of production and transportation, mean that local pro-ducers might make a profit of only 15 percent on thefactory gate price for raw mahogany. Some of thisprofit may go toward debt repayments to local inter-mediaries, given the lack of liquidity to meet up- frontproduction costs. But even discounting the costs of compliance, the returns to small- scale forest producers are limited by the small volumes they are permitted toharvest. And, because of insufficient capacity to pro-duce high- quality timber and the lack of alternativemarketing channels, many are locked into the domes-tic market\u2014 already saturated with cheap, illegal timber.There is, however, growing political recognition of the role of forests in rural poverty alleviation and of the need to provide equal opportunities for community- based forest producers. In 2000, Honduras launched a review of its forest sector through the Hon-duran Forest Agenda (AFH). The AFH is a forumestablished by the government and NGOs in 1996 fordialogue and coordination among a broad range of stakeholders, including producer groups, industry rep-resentatives, and indigenous peoples. The AFH reviewprocess secured a new national forest policy and law. Atthe time of drafting this note, the law was still beingfinalized for submission to Congress, but one of itsmain objectives was to secure a more equitable basis for community participation in forest management, including support for small enterprise development. Inaddition, the AFH is framing a new National ForestPlan, which will include a Community DevelopmentProgram. The PRSP , which was jointly formulated withcivil society, also makes provisions for participatoryforest management. Box 1.22 Overcoming Barriers to Pro- Poor Forestry in Honduras Source : Brown and others 2002.Adapt certification of forest products for small- scale and indigenous forestry (see note 1.3, Indigenous Peoplesand Forests, and note 3.2, Forest Certification Systems). Establish business services through NGOs or govern-ment extension for low- income producers that includemanagement services, organizational support, and tech- nical assistance, to link conservation of forest resources with processing of forest products (see box 1.23), marketinformation, insurance, and marketing and financialassistance (see box 1.25). NOTE 1.5: MAKING MARKETS WORK FOR THE FOREST - DEPENDENT POOR 59The Gambia has 264 Community Forest Committees (CFCs), 22 of which are developing their marketsand managing their forests using the Market Analysis and Development (MA&D) methodology through a joint project of the Gambian government and theFood and Agriculture Organization. The MA&D pro-gram is a three- phase program that trains andempowers community members to identify and develop successful forest enterprises and learn tomanage them independently. MA&D enables com-munities to link forest management and conserva-tion activities directly to income- generating oppor-tunities, and in the Gambian case it has alsoencouraged substantial diversification of marketable forest products. The program emphasizes sustainable institutional development for the community enter-prises and extensive networking between businessesand local organizations. In The Gambia, 22 CFCshave used MA&D methodology to develop 72 com- munity enterprises. Some of the communities now involved in success- ful enterprises have been entitled to commercialize community forest products since 1992 but, before theMA&D training, were hesitant to do anything otherthan protect their forests, or were repeatedly cheated bymiddlemen or Forestry Department staff. The communities produce 11 different products from their forests, including fuelwood, logs and timber, honey, palm handicrafts, Netto fruits, oil palm fruits,and tree nurseries. Through program- sponsored arti-san workshops, community members have learnedskills to craft new products from their forests, espe- cially beds, sofas, and chairs that are then sold to local ecotourism lodges and hotels in the coastal tourismarea. Profits from beekeeping are expected to accountfor 15 percent of their total yearly profits.Box 1.23 Market Analysis and Development in Community Forests of The Gambia Source : Molnar and others 2006. In the remote district of Rushinga in northeastern Zim- babwe, an individual runs a company called CreativeOils that produces oil from the seeds of the baobab. Creative Oils currently purchases six tons of seed per month from 60 rural producers. Rural producers canearn as much as $180 in a season, which is double theirincome from cotton, the staple cash crop. The owner ofCreative Oils earns nearly $9,000 a season from the 360 liters of oil the company produces a month. This success is due largely to an involvement with PhytoTrade Africa, the Southern African Natural Prod-ucts Trade Association. In 2003, PhytoTrade Africasigned a joint venture agreement with a French com-pany specializing in the production of derivatives fromnatural plant oils for sale as cosmetic ingredients. The French company purchases baobab oil from CreativeOils, which it then processes and sells to the multina- tional company Bergasol, for incorporation into a new sunscreen for sale in Europe. There are many products like baobab oil, derived from indigenous plant species in rural Africa and hav-ing significant commercial potential. For small- scale producers, however, the barriers to developing marketsfor these products are formidable. The owner of Cre-ative Oils has successfully overcome these barriers bypooling resources with producers from across southernAfrica and helping create a powerful trade associationto represent their interests.

Improve government support and extension services forforest smallholders. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS Potential actions that can be taken by international institu- tions, such as the World Bank, in partnership with govern-ment and other stakeholders, include the following: Organize global and national initiatives to promote mar-ket and institutional reforms to enable greater participa-tion of low- income producers in international trade andto protect their interests against trade rules and initia- tives that would create unfair competition against them. Develop new financial mechanisms to promote forestry investment for low- income producers, using domesticinvestment protocols and export guarantee systems to favor forest businesses that adopt business models sup- portive of low- income producers. Develop global normsof behavior for international companies who partnerwith local communities. Generate the research and information needed to under- stand present levels of market participation by differentgroups of low- income producers, incomes generated, business profitability, and actual competitive advantages. Also develop partnerships with others who will enablethe development of institutions to achieve these goals(Scherr, White, and Kaimowitz 2004). Improved commercial markets may not improve the liveli- hoods of rural communities and farmers with low- quality forest resources and poorly developed market infrastructure.In these situations it remains important to focus on the sub-sistence and environmental values of forestry development. Small- scale producers must be able to compete with low- cost industrial producers, as well as with producers who clearland or illegally extract forest products. The marketing strat-egy should complement the comparative advantages of thedifferent forest \"zones.\" (For example, people in remote areasmay be able to make money from harvesting high- value tim-ber. which compensates for high transportation costs. Closerto urban areas where forests are scarce, low- income produc-ers who plant trees in agroforestry systems can benefit fromthe proximity to urban markets when selling their timber.) Many attempts at NTFP commercialization from natural forests and agroforestry systems have failed to deliver the expected benefits because marketing and trading strategiesfor NTFPs have been neglected. It is essential that opportunities are provided for women to be more involved in strategies to improve the successfulcommercialization of NTFPs because women often dependon NTFP sales as a source of household income. A study inWest Bengal, India, reported that three times as manywomen as men were involved in gathering NTFPs, whichaccounted for 20 percent of household income (Scherr,White, and Kaimowitz 2004). NOTE 60 CHAPTER 1: FORESTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTIONThe Pangi Valley is a remote, high- altitude area in the Chamba district, in northwest HimachalPradesh. Most of the residents in the region subsist on single- season cash cropping, animal herding, road building, and most recently, collection andsale of medicinal plants and herbs from theregion's forests. More than 86 percent of residents surveyed in the Pangi Valley collected some medicinal plants and herbs from the forest during the collecting sea-son of mid- June to mid- October. In most villages,income from medicinal herbs is between 10 and 20percent of total cash income per household. Gener-ally, those who engage in the most medicinal herb collection are individuals with fewer opportunities for income, less land available for cultivation, andfewer local labor opportunities. This case contrasts with the situation in far western Nepal, also in the Himalayas, where mul-tidonor support to a market and technical networkorganization, Asia Network for Sustainable Agri-culture and Bioresources, and Nepali forest usergroups led to better markets for essential oils andmedicinals, investment in a NTFP paper- processing enterprise, and better resource extrac-tion and management.

Low-income forest producers include indigenous and other community groups who manage collectively owned forest resources; local individuals or groups who comanage or harvest products from the forest; smallholder farmers who manage remnant natural forests or plant trees in oraround their crop fields and pastures; individuals or groupswho engage in small-scale forest product processing; andemployees of forest production and processing enterprises (Scherr, White, and Kaimowitz 2003).

Developing countriesneed to explore and encourage all sources and mech- anisms of funding for the forest sector to achieve SFM. The private sector is expected to play the lead role in global eco-nomic and production activities. Private investment in theforestry sector in developing countries and countries intransition is estimated at US$15 billion per year, or up to nine times more than current official development assis-tance flows. 1 T o date, private investment in SFM has been concen- trated in developed countries. Although this trend is chang- ing, the need remains to motivate similar investment in developing countries to maximize the full potential of SFM, because investments required for harvesting and processingcan be large (for example, establishing a modern pulp millcan cost the better part of US$1 billion). Investments on thisscale can only come from global corporations or joint ven- tures involving local partners and development banks will-ing to cover the risk. Furthermore, ensuring that these largeinvestments are made in a socially and environmentallyresponsible manner is essential to preventing destructiveuse of forest resources. When discussing the need to attract investment to the forest sector in developing countries, many organizationsand governments tend to focus on large- scale internationalinvestors. However, the majority of the markets are domes-tic: For example, as much as 86 percent of the wood har-vested in the Brazilian Amazon is consumed within Brazil,and log exports from West and Central Africa account foronly 20 percent of the 25 million cubic meters harvested peryear. Although developed countries now consume approxi-mately 70 percent of industrial roundwood, consumption growth in developing countries is narrowing the gap: Theconsumption of industrial roundwood in developing coun-tries grew by 3.2 percent per year in 1996-97, in contrast todeveloped countries, where it grew by only 0.6 percent peryear (Victor and Ausubel 2000). In the forest sector, it would be logical for much of the new global private investment totry to capture the financial gains from these rising domesticmarkets in developing countries, where the majority of theworld's natural tropical forests are located. This aligns with global trends that show that while foreign direct investmentremains important in developing countries for foreignexchange earnings and skills and technology transfer, thebulk of private investment remains domestic across all sec- tors (ITTO 2006). The forest products industry supplies a wide range of essential products\u2014 from construction materials, paper,sanitary products, and specialty chemicals to watershed andsoil conservation\u2014 from a renewable resource. It providesmillions of jobs and supports thousands of local communi-ties with an annual production of about US$750 billion(WBCSD 2006). Considerable potential exists in these investments to deliver benefits to farmers, small forest owners, local com-munities, and Indigenous Peoples. Forest investment caninvolve small- and large- scale investments and can bring 63Engaging the Private Sector in Forest Sector DevelopmentCHAPTER 2together communities and companies through partnership arrangements, build small and medium enterprises (SMEs),or enable socially responsible corporate investments. SMEs are a major potential source for off- farm employment in rural areas (Molnar et al. 2006). PAST ACTIVITIES The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank Group, promotes sustainableprivate sector investment to foster economic development and reduce poverty. The IFC finances investments with its own resources and by mobilizing capital in the internationalfinancial markets. In addition to equity and loan financing,IFC also provides technical assistance to its clients, eitherfunded by grants or by the clients themselves. Between fiscal 22003 and fiscal 2006, the IFC invested more than US$1 billion to help finance 25 forestry sector projects with a total cost of about US$4 billion (figure 2.1). The size of projects fluctuated between US$3 million (a packaging project in the Kyrgyz Republic) and US$500 million (a paper millproject in China). The pulp and paper industry accounted for56 percent of the total, while 33 percent was directed at the wood- based panel and engineered- wood products industries, with some small investments made in sawmilling and furni-ture production. The share of forestry projects in private sec-tor financing was 11 percent and on the increase. The IFC hasnot invested in projects requiring raw material from naturaltropical moist forests. During this period, about half of IFCprojects included an integrated forestry component. IFC tech- nical assistance was mostly targeted at specific projects butsome sector work was also carried out. 3 Geographically, Europe and Central Asia (ECA) attracted most IFC financing during the 2003-06 period followed by East Asia and the Pacific (EAP), Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), South Asia (SAR), and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) (figure 2.2). Only one Africancountry appears in the IFC portfolio during the period. 4 IFC projects concentrated in 16 countries, and the Bank had forestry lending activities in 10 of them, indicating a con-siderable geographic overlap. 5 The relatively high proportion of IFC investment chan- neled to the ECA region reflects the importance of the Russ-ian Federation's forest industries and the emerging forest industrial investment opportunities in Eastern European transition countries. In both EAP and LAC, the IFC's maininvestments have been in rapidly expanding pulp and paperindustries in China, India, and Brazil. Although the link to poverty alleviation may not be direct in most IFC investments, the project companies often generate significant employment, ranging from a few hun- 64 CHAPTER 2: ENGAGING THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT The IFC has a Global Manufacturing and Services Department, within which there is a Forest Prod-ucts Sector. The portfolio of projects from this sec- tor spans a diverse group of pulp, paper, and con- verted products, ranging from linter and strawpulp to tissue, sacks, and various kinds of packag-ing. The sector involves dealing with sensitivepolitical, social, and environmental issues. Among the greatest risks are severe environmental andhuman health impacts associated with antiquatedtechnology and poor forest practices. Subsector categories in this sector include plan- tations, wood fiber, and woodworking. Source : http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/gms.nsf/Content/Forest _ Products_Overview.

Indirect employment impacts can be many times higher than direct employment,in particular when considering the forestry component. While almost all the investments to date relate to large industrial projects, the IFC has a particular interest in sup- porting the expansion and sustainable management ofupstream fiber sources. Greater IFC involvement in forestrycan enhance the positive impacts of industrial development in environmental conservation, economic development,and poverty alleviation while possible negative impacts canbe better mitigated. 6 The International Development Association and Inter- national Bank for Reconstruction and Development arms of the World Bank Group have invested in enabling private sector engagement in the forest sector in different ways. In FY05, the Bank financed the Cameroon Forest and Environ-ment development policy loan to help consolidate and scaleup recent successful forest sector policy reforms, supportcapacity building, and strengthen forest and environment institutions. In this loan, a prior action for release of the sec-ond tranche included signed contracts with companiesmeeting requirements and implementation of appropriatemeasures, including the withdrawal of concession, if appro-priate, for companies failing to meet requirements. Simi- larly, in the Lao People's Democratic Republic poverty sup- port reduction credit, there were prior actions that includedcompleting requirements for independent certification ofsustainable forest management and establishing a forest sec-tor monitoring system. The World Bank has also beeninvesting in activities enabling payments for environmentservices (see details in note 2.3, Innovative MarketingArrangements for Environmental Services). In addition to lending, since 2004, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Global Forest and Trade Network (GFTN)has been involved in World Bank- WWF Global ForestAlliance activities by building up enterprise- level capacity for certification and linking responsible suppliers with buy-ers (for example in Ghana, Indonesia, Nicaragua, Peru, Rus-sia, and Vietnam). In Nicaragua, the cooperation of theGFTN resulted in IFC support for local companies toachieve certification. A financing mechanism for forest con-cessionaires was developed in Peru. Development of timbertracking systems has been supported in Cambodia,Nicaragua, Peru, and in the Congo Basin countries. T o pro-mote responsible investment in forest management, PRO-FOR (Program on Forests) and the World Bank-WWFAlliance for Forest Conservation and Sustainable Use haveorganized three investment forums (a global forum in 2004,and regional forums in East Africa in 2004 and in SouthAfrica in 2006) that have focused on the development of the SME sector in forest- based activities within the frameworkof poverty reduction. KEY ISSUES Numerous private sector actors. A variety of private sector actors, all with different interests, capabilities, and constraints, influence the forest sector, including large multinational companies, local companies of varying sizes, individual private investors (for example, conservationinvestments by philanthropists), community or cooperative enterprises applying SFM, and small- scale forest owners. Primary manufacturers might include chainsaw opera- tors or small sawmills, in addition to large corporations whose annual sales might be larger than the gross domesticproduct (GDP) of many developing countries. All have thepotential to invest productively, create jobs, and expand\u2014 thereby contributing to economic growth and poverty reduction. Each type of business (or investment opportu-nity) can be affected differently by changes in internationaland domestic markets, as well as by changes in governmen-tal policies and the general in- country business and invest-ment environments (ITTO 2006). Factors influencing private sector investment. Factors that influence private sector decisions about forest- related investments include the following: Returns . Sufficient returns are a prerequisite; therefore, any factors that reduce the returns or profits from the investment can act as a deterrent. Risks . Weighing returns against risks, private investors generally demand much higher returns (typically 15 per-cent to 30 percent) from developing countries where risks are (or can be perceived as being) high. Transaction costs . High transaction costs can make investments less attractive. For example, evidence indi- cates that small investors in particular find it difficult to meet the additional costs associated with SFM (see note 3.2, Forest Certification Systems). Elements of an enabling environment. T o encourage the private sector to invest in SFM with full confidence and CHAPTER 2: ENGAGING THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT 65commitment, an enabling environment has several dimensions, both national and international. Some of thefactors may be outside the forest sector's control, yet they need to be addressed to promote investment in SFM. Key enabling actions include the following: Reducing domestic policy and institutional problems that restrain or discourage private sector engagement in SFM\u2014 for example, avoiding excessive and inappropriate regulations and bureaucracy that contribute to unduly high costs of registering companies and undertaking management. Seeking ministerial commitment for legislative and other policy reforms that will help to contain illegal loggingand create a level playing field for responsible companies that are willing to invest in SFM (see chapter 5, Improv- ing Forest Governance, and associated notes). The will-ingness of high- level political leaders and more responsi-ble companies to engage in supporting such initiatives asthe European Union- and World Bank- supported Forest Law Enforcement and Governance Program has been encouraging. Facilitating political stability necessary to assure in - vestors. Assisting governments to engage private sector compa-nies and local communities in dialogue regardingreforming timber allocation processes, achieving equi- table revenue sharing, taxation and revenue collection systems, encouraging value added processing, and ensur-ing a secure supply of raw material. Assisting governments to develop transparent timber allocation procedures and concession policies that willhelp to ensure a secure supply of raw material for poten- tial client companies, thus reducing the perception of risk for investors. Lack of security threatens the continu-ity of manufacturing operations. Ensuring stable and clear policies, institutions, and oper- ating environments, including those related to tenureand concessions. Developing instruments or drawing upon existinginstruments to hedge against excessive market fluctua-tions and seek mechanisms for better prices in interna- tional markets, and seeking ways to deter major markets from buying low- priced supplies from unsustainablesources that unfairly undermine responsible suppliersseeking to achieve SFM (see note 3.2, Forest CertificationSystems). Ensuring relevant training and skills development and research for the forestry sector.Helping to expand the profit base of SFM investmentsthrough environmental services (see note 2.3, Small andMedium Enterprises). Potential for relationships between companies and communities in the forest sector. With time and effort, some of the existing relationships between companies andcommunities could mature from superficial deals into real partnerships (Mayers and Vermeulen 2002; Howard Vermeulen and Walubengo 2006).These cover the full range of forest goods and services and awide variety of partnership models, including the following: In outgrower schemes and sales or purchase contracts, small- scale farmers grow trees or NTFPs on their ownplots with support from the company (such as technical advice, seed stock, fertilizers, pesticides, tools, harvest- ing) and with guaranteed purchase, sometimes at guar-anteed prices. In joint ventures, companies and communities make capital coinvestments in goods or service projects, possi-bly sharing management. Often the community's capital investment is land or labor. In simpler lease models, the company pays a fee for use rights on community landover a fixed period and the community plays no part in management. In multiple land-use arrangements on land under com- pany freehold or leasehold, communities are grantedaccess rights and management rights to noncore goods and services, typically NTFPs in forest areas managed primarily for timber production. In social responsibility contracts, the forestry company negotiates a social license to operate within environmen-tal and cultural limits set by the community; in return, the company receives the benefit of local investments, usually infrastructural. Globally, SMEs represent one ofthe faster growing industrial sectors in the world. Forest- based SMEs (SMFEs) account for 80-90 percent of all theforest enterprises in many countries (box 2.2). For many countries, more than 50 percent of total forest- relatedemployment is in SMFEs, with approximately 20 millionpeople employed worldwide. SMFEs generate a grossvalue added of about US$130 billion per year (Macqueenand others 2006). Greater awareness of the potential of SMFEs to contribute to essential subsistence needs and to poverty alleviation and economic growth is needed (seenote 2.2, Small and Medium Enterprises). Such awarenessshould inform both forest policies and policies regardingmarket access, credit, and other relevant macro policies. 66 CHAPTER 2: ENGAGING THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT MARKETS FOR FOREST ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES .Markets for environmental services need further development and may require the creation of an enabling environment for private sector investment in this area. This could be facilitated by providing greater clarity on the potential financial benefitsof environmental services and greater certainty regarding theassociated markets (see note 2.3, Innovative MarketingArrangements for Environmental Services). Consensus is growing that investment in the sector has to occur within a credible framework of safeguards and envi- ronmental assessment procedures. These have to motivateresponsible investment and deter unsustainable anddestructive activities. There is a need to address such issues as the identification and protection of forests that are a high priority for biodiversity conservation, protection of rightsand resource interests of Indigenous Peoples and other forest- dependent people, certification and other systems ofindependent verification of forest management perfor-mance, and establishment and management of forest andagricultural tree- crop plantations (see note 1.3, IndigenousPeoples and Forests, and section II, Guide to Implementing,Forests Policy OP 4.36). The various safeguard initiativesalso need to be harmonized and extended to a broader rangeof investing groups. FUTURE PRIORITIES FOR ACTIVITIES Increasing demand for forest products, especially in devel- oping countries, indicates that investment in the forest sec-tor will likely expand. Major prospects are in Brazil, China,India, and Russia. T o ensure that the growing private invest- ment generates benefits for a wide range of forest users and forest- dependent households, some priority actions mustbe taken: Increase availability of and access to financing for small- scale forestry and wood processing.Opportunities that would provide funding for small- scaleenterprises and mechanisms that would strengthen thesupply chain for SMEs should be explored. Provide incentives for the private sector to manage (rather than solely log) natural forests, to adopt a longer- term and broader view of forests (even for plantationforestry and the timber processing industry), take onemerging opportunities, and reduce perceptions of risk. Remove constraints related to investments in sustainable management of natural tropicalforests. This should be done by the international community (the Bank and the IFC in cooperation withother donors and intergovernmental organizations [such as ITTO], nongovernmental organizations [NGOs], and theprivate sector) in collaboration with governments. Theobjective should be to enable policy reform to improve theinvestment environment and strengthen the policy andregulatory frameworks for responsible investment. Continue providing support to the establishment, and on- the- ground implementation, of environmentallysound legal and regulatory standards and capacity,which are essential to creating the necessary preconditions forthe sustainable operation of the predominantly downstreamprivate operators. Because forest- based investments areusually made with a long- term time horizon, all means tomitigate risks are particularly important for private investors.Risk mitigation through enabling conditions is key in thedecision making of responsible private investors. Build capacity at all levels to address the lack of capacity in many developing countries to adequately implement environmental assessment procedures andsafeguards. This increased capacity would developmultistakeholder institutional mechanisms for monitoringforest harvesting and management, especially where these are weak. The presence of visible and strong institutionalmechanisms to implement monitoring of environmentalprocedures and safeguards can substantially contribute toproject risk mitigation and would both encourage and CHAPTER 2: ENGAGING THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT 67Since 1995, Brazilian small and medium enter- prises have grown annually by 2.8 percent and 4.7percent, respectively\u2014 much faster than larger enterprises\u2014 despite having a higher failure rate than larger companies, with 39 percent failing inBrazil within the first year (a reasonably averagefailure rate globally for small and medium enter-prises (May, Da Vinha, and Macqueen 2003)). Log- ging by SMFEs in Guyana contributes almost asmuch to the revenue of the Guyana Forestry Com-mission as do large enterprises (Thomas et al.2003). In China, more than 90 percent of the totalvalue of wood products is generated by SMFEs(Sun and Chen 2003). Source : ITTO 2006.Box 2.2 The Prevalence of SMFEs support socially and envi ronmentally responsible companies. Continue further collaboration between the Bank and the IFC. IFC investments in an environmentally sustainable private company can demonstrate profitabilitywithin the framework of a Bank- supported regulatorystructure (supply response), and it is at this intersection that the benefits of collaboration are strongest. Areas where theBank and the IFC should increase collaboration include the following: promotion of investment in forest- based, small- scale enterprises; increased exchange of information at the country,regional, global, and research levels; further cooperation in areas where engagement hasalready been demonstrated to be beneficial (for example,the IFC could enhance the use of the GFTN of the World Bank- WWF Alliance in linking its investments with responsible buyers); and additional Bank economic and sector work and analyti- cal and advisory activities, especially those related to gov-ernance reform, that can help create enabling conditions for IFC investment projects. 7 NOTES 1. In 2002 the World Bank estimated that total forest sector private investment in developing countries and countries in transition was about US$8 billion to US$10 billion per year. This may underestimate actual private sector investment. According to the FAO (2005), the plantation area in develop-ing countries is increasing at about 1.8 million hectares peryear. This represents investments of US$3 billion to US$4 bil-lion per year. Improvements in existing forest management should be added to this, but reliable estimates do not exist. Inplantation-based projects, industrial investments represent80-90 percent of the total. Applying this coefficient\u2014withplantation investments being 20 percent of the total\u2014totalforest investment in developing countries should be at leastUS$15 billion. 2. The World Bank operates according to a fiscal year that begins July 1 and ends June 30. 3. As an example, there is ongoing work to prepare a strategic plan for the pulp and paper industry in Ukraine. 4. This appears to be due to the scarcity of companies that can meet IFC criteria for support. 5. The regional analysis is based on the projects with a total value of US$800 million. In two countries without theBank's forest lending, there are practically no production forests. 6. The upstream forestry activities have significant poten- tial for rural poverty reduction. As an example, IFC projects in India have engaged 135,000 farmers or families in coop-erative arrangements with pulp and paper companies, cov-ering a total area of 128,000 hectares. Each family typicallyallocates 1 to 2 hectares to forest plantation to increase theirincome, demonstrating that primarily poor households areinvolved in these schemes. Similar arrangements are alsobeing supported by IFC-financed projects in Brazil. IFC hasalso provided technical assistance to small-scale, forest-based operations in Central America through the LAC Proj-ect Development Facility in collaboration with the GFTN.The future impact of these investments can be significantfor employment and local income, if such efforts movebeyond technical assistance. 7.

Companies are formal entities organ-ized for making a profit, and range from large multinationalcorporations to small- scale local businesses. Communitiesinclude local farmers, households, and community- level units of social organization, such as producer groups or vil-lage councils. Most partnerships to date have formed around produc- tion of industrial pulpwood (outgrower, joint venture, andlease schemes) and high- quality timber (mainly lease schemes). NTFP- based partnerships are most important in the case of high- value NTFPs (such as certain resins andmedicinal plants). A niche is now growing for partnershipsaround forest ecosystem services, including carbon seques-tration, watershed management, biodiversity, and eco-tourism (see note 2.3, Innovative Marketing Arrangementsfor Environmental Services). The variety of partnershipmodels are covered in table 2.1. Both company and community partners have a variety of motives for entering into agreements. Immediate eco-nomic motives include access to niche markets, access to Table 2.1 Company- Community Partnership Models for Different Forest Goods and Services Partnership model Joint venture Multiple land Outgrower or or lease on use on Social responsibility Forest good or service sales contract community land company land contract Timber and wood fiber (see box 2.3) \u2014 (see box 2.4) Nontimber forest products (see box 2.5) \u2014 (see box 2.6) Ecosystem services \u2014 (see box 2.7) Source: Vermeulen 2006.

Grower contracts over 11 years are based on a 50:50 profit- sharing ratio, with the company providing most inputs, but land- owning farmers free to sell to other buyers ifthe company is unable to absorb the harvest atcurrent market prices. Farmers have benefitedfrom early revenues through trimming, and at fullharvest (from 2005 onward) returns are about US$450 per hectare to both company and community.

Hence, the company, in partnership with a forestry NGO, has developed purchase agreements with wattle farmers. Vegext agrees tocollect bark from any farm within 70 km of its col-lection yard at Eldoret and to pay a higher price than competitors; indeed, one of the company'sobjectives is to raise wattle prices so that farmersconsider wattle an attractive alternative to othertree crops and seasonal crops.

The company agreed tohand over all assets to the community at the end ofthe joint venture. The agreement came to an earlyclose, satisfactory to both sides, when the commu-nity bought out the company's share using aninternational grant. The community has since built on its strengths, opening a research center at the site and winning the Conservation Interna-tional ecotourism award in 2000.

Company- community forestry partnerships have the potential to contribute to Bank objectives of SFM and rural development. A recent international review (Vermeulen andWalubengo, 2006) concluded that these partnerships canhelp communities reduce risk, achieve better returns on land use, diversify income sources, access paid employment,develop new skills, upgrade infrastructure, and enhanceecosystem management. They are also a mechanism forcompanies to practice SFM on their own land (Brody et al.2006). However, company- community partnerships have not yet proved sufficient to lift people out of poverty and remain supplementary rather than central to income generation. OPERATIONAL ASPECTS Context and conditions for partnerships. Experience shows that company- community forestry partnerships can emerge under a wide range of political and economic conditions. In considering whether partnerships may be appropriate\u2014 and what kinds of partnerships are likely to work\u2014 some important conditions to consider include the following: Production and markets -Sound business . Artificial promotion of partnerships for social gains will not work\u2014 an internationally competitive ratio of benefits to costs and risks must be demonstrated for specific forest products at the site level. -Integrated land use . Trees for fiber and fuel compete with food crops and grazing land and may or may not provide differential environmental services\u2014 partnerships will only work where a locally appropri-ate balance is achieved. -Multiple use . Opportunities for multiple land use at one site favor the use of partnerships (such as com- bining timber production, NTFP production, and ecosystem functions). -Market maturity . New production systems and new markets favor tight contractual partnerships whiledeveloped, open markets favor looser arrangements. -Access to technology and information . Insufficient tech- nical and market knowledge among communities is amajor disincentive to formation of partnerships.Policy and governance -Land tenure . Changes in land and resource tenure (such as the privatization of state forests or securing of collective land title) often precipitate partnerships because partners need new deals to access forest production. -Forest sector incentives . In some countries, specific pol- icy statements encourage partnerships (such as the comanagement requirements for state forest land). -Extra- sectoral incentives . Some policies are generally pro- partnership, such as those that encourage decentraliza-tion (see note 5.1, Decentralized Forest Management) orprovide incentives to indigenous or small- scale business, while particular policies encourage different types of partnership (for example, environmental tax breaksfavoring ecosystem service partnerships). -Governance . Implementation and survival of partner- ships require considerable backstopping, includingfunctional courts and efficient systems for legal recog-nition of representative bodies (see note 5.4, Strength-ening Fiscal Systems in the Forest Sector). 1 -Private- sector policy . Multinational corporate policies can precipitate transfer of partnership models internationally. Contractual arrangements. Partnership models may be based on successful arrangements elsewhere\u2014 and initial negotiations often depend on an external moderator. Typicalagreements, verbal or written, include terms for financial and technical inputs, loan repayments, and benefit- sharing.Partners involved can benefit from advice and oversight oncontractual terms (see Mayers and Vermeulen [2002] forguidance), and options for making the most of externalincentive schemes should be explored, including carbon credits, certification, or business compacts. Time requirement for forming partnerships. It takes continual investment over long periods to build partnerships. Experience to date reveals three broadscenarios for the development of company- communityforestry relationships: (i) little constitutive change over longperiods, with the company partner taking the lead indirecting the partnership; (ii) strengthening of thecommunity partner's position, such as renegotiation ofbenefit sharing or the community forming a company; and(iii) dissolution of the partnership (see \"Ending a Partnership\" below). A move toward tighter partnerships isnot always desirable\u2014 in buoyant, competitive forestproduct markets, looser arrangements that are sensitive to demand and price trends will be much more sustainable. Importance of Risk and operational flexibility. Partnerships are a means to share risks, particularly thoseassociated with production and markets. Adaptability hasproved to be key to the success of company- communitypartnerships. Best practices include allowance in contracts for flexible technical features (for example, partial earlyharvesting of timber, annual reassessments of NTFP offtake,variable levies for tourism or other ecosystem services),flexible loan repayment terms, provisions for alternativeavenues for marketing in the event of over- or under- harvest, well- defined terms for managing any disputes, and renegotiating the contract on a regular basis. Transaction costs and power sharing. Dealing with a large number of scattered farmers or groups is a major challenge, not only for technical reasons (extension,harvesting, transport) but also for collective decision making.Power sharing is critical for both equity and resilience ofpartnerships (Ashman 2001). For communities, the solutionis to create economies of scale and raise bargaining power byjoining or forming farmers' groups, cooperatives, and othercoalitions. Even small associations have been successful in saving costs and improving marketing\u2014 but so far there arefew examples of communities improving partnership termsthrough collective bargaining. Ending a partnership. Some partnerships have disintegrated amid bad faith and litigation. However, termination does not necessarily mean failure, andconversely, close partnerships may outlive their utility. Aspriorities and market opportunities shift, partners maymake strategic choices away from formal collaborationtoward looser working relations. For the community, thepartnership may be a steppingstone to developing viableindependent enterprises, while for the company, theincreased business acumen within the community providesreliable new opportunities (to develop and supply high- quality products and services, for instance). LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS Company- community partnerships take a long time to establish\u2014 they are built on trust gained through experi-ence. The World Bank and other third parties can play acrucial role in enabling and supporting company- community partnerships for the benefit of local livelihoodsand SFM. Existing local organizations are an important route to building deal- brokering capacity in communities. Theselocal organizations often have the institutional flexibility to service community needs independent of external influences and the potential to provide equitable repre-sentation and a forum for equitable negotiation. Empowerment must be an explicit objective of partner- ship schemes. Often the poorest people are only partici-pants as contractors to those with land. T o enable com- munity empowerment, arrangements for revenue sharing, sharing ownership in downstream processing,and other broader joint ventures are important. Empow-erment must be an objective if partnerships are to sub-stantively raise people out of poverty. Greater attention must be given to forming enterprise partnerships with entities other than limited liabilitycompanies. Partnership structures, such as cooperatives, should also be explored. The details of benefit sharing and cost and risk sharing should be examined closely to ensure that the term \"part-nership\" describes arrangements that are equitable for all parties. Local communities may often need legal assistance to clarify their land ownership rights and in negotiatingsuch rights. There is a risk that benefits may only accrue to a smallsection of the community (for example, outgrowerhouseholds) while the community at large may suffer loss of land rights and resource access (livestock house- holds, for instance), leading to a need to examine bothbusiness projection and local tenure arrangements (legaland customary) to ensure such outcomes are avoided. Explore current options and future scenarios for partnerships. This includes supporting work toward increasing understanding of practical arrangements forefficient and equitable community- company partnerships.It is important to build understanding in the community of practice of the impacts of corporate social responsibility and the cooperative movement. Equally important is toexploit the willingness of companies to network on company- community partnerships (for example, inIndonesia and South Africa). Leading companies cancontinue to exchange experiences and to experiment with 74 CHAPTER 2: ENGAGING THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT NOTE 2.1: COMPANY - COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS 75innovative tools that promote equitable company- community arrangements, such as ethical supply chainmanagement and transparent corporate reporting. These companies lead the way by going beyond legislative requirements to explore pioneering partnership models. Promote access to insurance, credit, and legal and business services. Community partners would gain much from mechanisms to mitigate risk independently, outsidethe partnership. Such mechanisms can be developed byinvesting in insurance schemes that explore alternativepolicies for small- scale producers and strengthening safetynets for community members who may lose if a partnershipends. Communities involved in partnerships would alsobenefit from independent arbitration and assistance withlegal aid in the event of legal actions. There have beenadvancements in small- scale finance schemes, yet moresupport is needed. Business information and advisoryservices for partners also still need support. Support capacity building for business skill development. The performance of community partners would improve further through support to capacity- building in business (for example, understandingorganizational and contractual models, market niches andmarket standing, technology and innovation, management of costs, and future trends). The capacity of communityinstitutions and individuals needs to be strengthened innegotiation skills, negotiation of contractual terms, andbusiness development. Greater support for development ofcommunity entrepreneurship is also important. Ensure policy coherence and accessibility. Partnerships are influenced by government policy and service provision across several sectors (for example, land, tax, trade,agriculture, forestry). Companies, communities, and theirsupporters repeatedly raise the need for national and localgovernments to coordinate and clarify relevant incentives,regulations, and agencies (Howard et al. 2005; Vidal 2005a,2005b). While industry standards can help, governments andinternational bodies need to guard against stringency thatfavors the largest players in the industry at the expense ofsmaller, locally owned companies. T o ensure this, members ofrepresentative community bodies should be included inpolicy dialogue at the national level. Governments would gainfrom support in development of complementary oralternative partnership facilitation services. Support the development of value added productsand services. Few company- community partnerships go beyond production or site management. Community partners can reap far greater benefits if they are able to capture a share of value added operations, such as timber sawmills, downstream processing of NTFPs, or add- ons toecosystem management (tailored tourism facilities, forinstance; see box 2.5 and box 2.7 for examples). Supporterscould also facilitate new business links that help communities secure a larger share of the value chain (forexample, Fair Trade). New initiatives that include multipleroles for the community can help to bring benefits to thepoorest members of the community who are otherwiseexcluded (by providing employment to landless people, for instance). Support community networks and their representation. Associations and coalitions continue to be the most effective routes for communities to raisebargaining power. Support to networks and associations ofcommunity interests and emerging small businesses willhelp, as will efforts to increase meaningful representation by small- scale providers of forest goods and services in existingplatforms for the forestry industry. Existing bodies thatrepresent community interests are both legitimate anddynamic and may be forest specific or formed around agriculture. NOTE 1.

CROSS- REFERENCED CHAPTERS AND NOTES Note 2.3: Innovative Marketing Arrangements for Environ- mental Services Note 5.1: Decentralized Forest Management Note 5.4: Strengthening Fiscal Systems in the Forest Sector 76 CHAPTER 2: ENGAGING THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT 77SMFEs are business operations aimed at making profit from forest-based activity. They are commonlydefined by employment (between 10 and 99 full-time employees), by annual turnover (US$10,000-US$30,000,000), or by annual roundwood consumption (3,000-20,000 cubicmeters) (Macqueen and Mayers 2006). SMFEs can offer a trajectory out of poverty. SMFEs play a critical role in securing poor people's basic needs, spread- ing wealth locally, enabling local innovation, and preservingcultural identity and practices (Macqueen 2005; Macqueenand Mayers 2006). SMFEs grouped together in clusters orassociations can reduce transaction costs for the poor,develop strategic alliances, and shape the policy environ- ment through lobbying on behalf of the poor (Macqueen, Figueiredo et al. 2005; Macqueen, Vermeulen et al. 2005). SMFEs are diverse and complicated to deal with. SMFE diversity is linked to a number of factors, including thatthey span both timber and NTFPs, and include rural pro-ducers, suppliers to large firms, primary and secondaryprocessors, and forest service providers. It is difficult tomake generalizations regarding SMFEs; thus, it is importantto consider the following: how supportive the policy and institutional environ- ments are toward SMFEs (Macqueen 2005) whether the market structure offers real opportunity ormerely options of last resort whether the business structures adopted by SMFEs arethose of profit-driven companies, democraticallyaccountable social cooperatives, or something in between (Macqueen 2006) whether SMFEs are isolated entities or an integral part of a broader network SMFEs tend to be underrepresented in policy initiatives and development programs. This could be on account of the following:the complexity of linking with diverse SMFEs in multi- ple locations\u2014even when they are grouped into associa-tions (there are 2,000-3,000 forest-based associations in Uganda; Kazoora et al. 2006) the constitutional diversity of these enterprises, which diminishes the likelihood of common agendas, lessonlearning, and diffusion of relevant solutions (Saigal et al. 2006) the small individual scale of each enterprise, which reduces both per unit impact (that is, the perceived ben-efit to the development agency) and comparative human and financial costs of compliance (that is, the perceived benefits to the enterprise) The lack of formal incorporation and collateral through which SMFEs become visible to public bodies and privatesector investors. For example, the informal economy makes up 41 percent of gross national income in developing coun- tries (Schneider 2002) and is highest where incomes andassets are not evenly distributed (Becker 2004) Despite their potential, it can be challenging to make SMFEs sustainable. Exploitative SMFEs can easily go unchecked. Informality, insecure tenure, low investment,and low profitability may reduce scope for social or envi-ronmental benefits. Lack of management capacity inSMFEs may lead to resource depletion. Risks are highest in \"distress diversification,\" where SMFEs seek refuge in low-skill activities and seasonal migration for productswithout long-term prospects. High risks often lead policymakers and decision makers to marginalize SMFEs, butperhaps because of this, many self-help solutions haveevolved around local enterprise associations and net-works. Responsive support to these local institutions inareas such as market information, secure resource access,sustainable management, design and technology, andfinancial and business administration can make all thedifference.Small and Medium EnterprisesNOTE 2.278 CHAPTER 2: ENGAGING THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT Due consideration should be given to the different values recognized by different types of SMFEs. The diversity of SMFEs is paralleled by a diversity of values. For example, profit-driven SMFEs may place economic values above social or environmental concerns (Macqueen 2006), whilelocal or indigenous forest groups attribute up to 13 differentvalues to forests (Brown and Reed 2000), of which \"com-mercial values\" used by economists in cost-benefit analysis or internal rate of return calculations represent only 6 per-cent of the sum of scaled forest values (Rowcroft, Studley,and Ward 2006). SMFEs have variable social impacts. Depending on enterprise type, management disposition, and circum- stances, SMFEs may differ in their social impact. Distress diversification or \"SMFEs of last resort\" often fail to deliverincreasing social welfare. Particular care is required whereoutsourcing to SMFEs is prevalent (Clarke and Isaacs 2005),and greater benefits are evident in T ownson 1998; Belcher, Ruiz-Perez,and Achdiawan 2005). For some products and services,market opportunities expand with the SMFE's increasingincome, and the economic distance between SMFEs andlarge enterprise technologies, and employment standards,start to fall. Identifying which is which\u2014whether the SMFEis of last resort or upwardly mobile\u2014is a critical first step for appropriate intervention. SMFEs have variable environmental impacts; enterprise type, management disposition, and the policy environmentlargely determine environmental impacts. SMFEs may cutenvironmental corners in the search for economic competi-tiveness, especially if the underlying legal and regulatoryframework and government capacity for implementationare weak. Informality of operations, insecure tenure, inade-quate investment, and low profitability may reduce environ-mental benefits. For example, SMFEs face great difficultywith third-party certification (Higmann and Nussbaum2002) despite group schemes designed to accommodatethem (Forest Stewardship Council 2004). For many SMFEs,local accountability for environmental impacts can enhanceenvironmental quality, especially at the landscape level(Clay, Alcorn, and Butler 2000; Scherr, White, andKaimowitz 2004; Durst and others 2005). OPERATIONAL ASPECTS Annex 2.2A to this note provides a checklist of key issues to consider to determine SMFE program direction and feasi-bility. This section discusses some of these issues in more detail. Strengthen transparent access to land and resources for SMFEs. There are no cure-alls that will ensure transparent access to land and resources, andneither individual title, nor, conversely, community forestmanagement, strengthens SMFEs in all cases. In somecases, clear land titling helps. In others, it is the democraticinvolvement of marginalized groups in decisions overcommon land that is critical. A priority is to identify andaddress, jointly with SMFEs, ill-developed or poorlyunderstood codes and institutions that govern these rights(see note 1.4, Property and Access Rights). Many forestproducts or services with SMFE potential come fromcommon property resources, which cannot be privatized,thus collective rather than individual decisions arerequired. Support local sovereignty and orient SMFEs primarily to local product or service markets.SMFEs can flourish in situations where they respond to civilsociety concerns about where products are originating, howthey are produced, and who is profiting. 1With regard to wider applicability, it is worthwhile to support SMFEs in identifying demand in local markets that are not yet highly competitive, local skills that can be used, options for specialization over time, and nonperishable products,unless excellent infrastructure exists. See box 2.8 forexamples from India and Guyana. Identify \"superior\" products or services for which demand rises with increasing income. Products that are only useful as subsistence safe ty nets or seasonal gap fillers In India, the Madhya Pradesh Minor Forest Pro- duce Cooperative has successfully developed a taskforce on ayurvedic herbal medicines with a retail outlet and consultations to support primary NTFP medicinal plant collection and processing societies(Saigal and others 2006). In Guyana, the SuramaEco-tourism Enterprise has developed a tourismpackage to showcase Makushi cultural identity and natural resources\u2014a win-win combination forculturally sensitive development and the environ-ment (Ousman and others 2006). An importantlesson is that, unless ethical market niches or aunique world-class resource exists, it can beunwise to target export markets.Box 2.8 Local Sovereignty, Markets, and SMFEs in India and GuyanaNOTE 2.2: SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES 79must be distinguished from products and services that can be critical steppingstones out of poverty. Improve information flows. SMFEs generally suffer from poor market information, and global communication technology and market access favor large multinationals,often to the detriment of SMFEs. Timely marketinformation, through local radio networks or electronic media, can shift the balance back in their favor. For someproducts, local cultural tastes and the origin of productionstill count, which gives SMFEs local competitiveadvantages. Help break up market monopolies. Market monopolies tend to exclude SMFEs\u2014especially where large enterprises and government officials collude. In India, for example, thenegative impact on small-scale producers of governmentmarketing corporations has been well documented.Systematic attempts to break up monopolies (andassociated collusion and corruption) require action at manylevels. Mobilizing local legal support groups or independentforest monitoring can be useful tactics. Support appropriate economic incentives or campaigns against unreasonable subsidies and trade barriers\u2014depending on circumstances. Free trade can be biased toward larger enterprises because of inequities inpower and scale efficiencies. Depending on the context, itmay be necessary to ensure that trade reforms andeconomic incentives do not result in accumulation ofpower in the hands of a few, marginalizing small-scaleproducers. Strengthen the capacity of SMFEs to attract investment. Building capacity for accurate risk assessments, installing policy interventions to underwritecollateral, and developing financial administration all canserve to attract investment. Transaction costs hamper theattempts of financial institutions to reach SMFEs\u2014whooften rely on their own savings (Spantigati and Springfors2005). In some cases, group forest certification has been auseful tool for unlocking credit (see note 3.2, ForestCertification Systems). Strengthen the capacity to negotiate financial deals with investment agencies and big business. The potential often exists to combine financial capacitydevelopment, group lending schemes, and marketdevelopment (see box 2.9 for an example from Guatemala).Seeking support through local institutions deserves wider application. Also, risk assessments should better reflectforest timeframes, seasonality, returns, and constraints so that banks are better able to do business with SMFEs. Build capacity in product or service design. Specialization is often critical to ongoing success.Information about what customers want can be obtained through training courses in design, trade fairs, pooled marketresearch within an association, benign middlemen, orspecialized information services, such as market chainworkshops. Consumer concerns for fairer trade and moresustainable forest management drive networks that specifically target SMFEs and build their entrepreneurial capacity\u2014even if all of the final product or service is notdistributed through such channels. Develop economic incentives or grants to support the needs of forest enterprise associations. Forest enterprise associations can help shape the policyenvironment, reduce transaction costs, and invest inadaptive strategies to take advantage of new opportunities.Specific administrative, financial, and technical trainingcan be extremely useful if properly targeted throughexisting associations (see box 2.10 for an example from Brazil). Devolve control over forest management to local SMFEs to reduce the risk of forest conflicts, which are endemic to many forested areas. 2Insecure rights and inequitable resource use in remote forest areas breed In Guatemala, community forest enterprises in the heavily forested Pet\u00e9n region managed to obtaincredit from two banks, Banrural and Bancaf\u00e9. This achievement was based heavily on (i) support for clear tenure rights, such as the legal establishmentof a community concession system; (ii) technicalsupport from business development providers;(iii) strong partnerships (including advance pay- ments) with the timber industry and a dedicatedjoint marketing company (Forescom); and (iv) anassociation, Forest Communities of thatprovided Source: Macqueen 2006.Box 2.9 Building SMFE Negotiating Capacitygrievances\u2014in more extreme cases providing the motive and means for financing conflict (Kaimowitz 2005). Incertain circumstances, putting local resources into local hands may be most appropriate. Local SMFEs generally have a greater understanding of local social and politicalcontexts, stronger links with local civil society, and a greatercommitment to operating in a specific area than do large-scale enterprises. Inappropriate forest land allocation to large players (even if justified by more sustainable forestmanagement) may undermine local control and its \"silentsocial responsibility\" and generate conflict (Ozinga 2004). LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS Invest in understanding SMFEs and, if appropriate, initially work with pilots. Information on SMFEs in developing countries is often inadequate, especially for NTFPs (Thomas and others 2003), and it takes time to collect information and assess the impact of policies on SMFEs inthe field (Johnstone, Cau, and Norfolk 2004; Johnstone andothers 2004). SMFE staff are also usually heavily time-constrained and risk averse. Hidden constraints can prevent expansion of forest product activities. Available time, culturalroles, social priorities, and misconceptions or mistrust of the language of economic development can affect outcomes.T ools to get to know entrepreneurs are essential (Mangal andForte 2005). Smaller trial interventions with a long timeframe may be necessary for initial implementation. Ensure that interventions are based on demand-driven approaches rather than approaches to supplyingcapacity. Trying to make what sells is invariably better than trying to sell what can be made. T oo often the focus of SMFEprograms is supply driven\u2014for example, trying to createemployment or raise income levels (Artur and Kanji 2005). Partnerships between large firms and SMFEs can help to overcome some of the capacity deficits that constrain vertical adaptation and specialization. Fair deals that balance resource supply with technological exchange from the largefirm is a model that has worked in instances where it is in theinterest of both sides. However, it must be assumed thatnegotiations are stacked in favor of large firms; thus, specifictools and processes should be used to equip SMFEs fornegotiating (Joaquim, Norfolk, and Macqueen 2005). Work with existing enterprise associations. The vast majority of SMFEs link themselves in some way to associations that help to shape the policy environment,reduce transaction costs, and invest in adaptive strategies totake advantage of new opportunities. Good information canbe found about what makes associations work well (forexample, Agrawal 2001). Working with trusted intermediariesto support the specific training needs identified byassociations is fundamental to SMFE support (Macqueen,Figueiredo et al. 2006; Macqueen, Vermeulen et al. 2005). Give preferential support to forms of enterprise that are designed to achieve progressive social andenvironmental objectives. For some enterprises, such as associations, cooperatives, and nonprofit companies linked tomarginalized groups, these objectives are as important as profit, and it is worth providing preferential support to orprocurement policies for such aims (Macqueen 2006). T oolssuch as Fair Trade already exist that favor cooperative formsof enterprise or particular marginalized groups (for example, black economic empowerment procurement policies inSouth Africa or equivalents for First Nations in Canada). Establish cross-agency coordination to simplify, stabilize, and implement pro-SMFE policies andsupport programs. In many countries, the burden of 80 CHAPTER 2: ENGAGING THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT In Brazil, the National Institute for Colonisation and Land Reform requires settlers to register anassociation to access government titles to land, housing, and infrastructure. Many of these associ- ations became dormant after this obligationpassed, but some, such as the Association of theSettlement Project California, have gone on toconsolidate their associations and pursue mem- bers' interests, and having a representative bodyhas allowed potential partners to engage. For example, the NGO GTA (Amazon Working Group) has built milk and pork agro-industry facil-ities and fruit and honey processing units. Electric-ity was supplied through a government program called \"Light in the Countryside.\" Adult education was supplied through a government education pro-gram. Association members experimented withoutgrowing soybeans, but are now looking for gov-ernment support for biofuel production. Source: Figueiredo and others 2006.Box 2.10 Supporting Forest Enterprise Associations in BrazilNOTE 2.2: SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES 81overregulation falls most heavily on smaller enterprises (see box 2.11 on South Africa). Experience has shown that SMFEsrequire a range of policy and support services and that external intervention can help to ensure that there is some degree of dialogue between such services, both to optimizewhat exists and to identify gaps. Institutionalize mechanisms to coordinate SMFE activities across multiple government authorities.Multiple overlapping authorities with varying responsibilitiescan often tie up the SMFE sector in red tape. Developing strongand clear advocacy messages within broad coalitions can shiftpolicies and institutions. For example, depending on the context, it may be useful to establish a cross-ministerial SME development council or administrative body to coordinatepolicies. This might be linked with sector-specific SME centers,including forestry. In turn, these might interact with SMEinvestment companies and banks or technical and businesssupport companies, including cooperatives and credit unions. Support for SMFEs can be channeled through leaders of local enterprise associations and cooperatives.Dynamic individuals (often necessary to the establishment ofan enterprise association) can serve as useful contact pointsabout how to channel support to SMFEs. Associations workbest when they arise independently without political patronage; this should be supported rather than creating newinstitutions (Agrawal 2001). Track and support extension networks of local activists who support SMFEs. Experience has shown that SMFE support programs run by local groups andactivists with long track records of community engagement can be successful and overcome the problems of centralizedextension and support services that often bypass SMFEs(see box 2.12). Local networks can build administrative andtechnical capacity. It is vital that such local institutions, andthe SMFEs they support, are known and understood; thus, data on SMFEs and their supporting institutions need to be collected. Such data could inform the option of catalyzingand rolling out programs area by area. NOTES 1. While this is the starting point for most communities and for many this is the market focus that remains, some communities and some products could have export oppor- tunities, especially for some commercially valuable NTFPs. 2.

The main categories of such benefitsare as follows: Watershed protection . Forests play an important role in reg- ulating hydrological flows and reducing sedimentation.Changes in forest cover can affect the quantity and quality of water flows downstream, as well as their timing, in both positive and negative ways. A clear understanding of theseimpacts is crucial for ecologically sound forest land use planning. Biodiversity conservation . Forests harbor an important part of the world's biodiversity. Loss of habitat (such as forests) is a leading cause of species loss. Carbon sequestration . Forests and forest soils contain large stocks of carbon, sequestering it from the atmo-sphere and playing a vital role in climate regulation. Because these are benefits enjoyed by people outside theforests, forest managers\u2014 whether local communities or logging companies\u2014 have no external financial incentive totake them into account in forest management decisions. Forest loss or degradation can cause adverse impacts on those who benefit from these forest services\u2014 creatingscope for arrangements in which the users of the servicescompensate forest managers for managing forests in waysthat generate the desired services. This is the basis of the Payments for Environmental Services (PES) approach. The PES approach is a market- based approach to conser- vation financing based on the twin principles that those whobenefit from environmental services (such as users of cleanwater) should pay for them, and that those who contribute to generating these services should be compensated for pro-viding them. The approach thus seeks to create mechanismsto arrange for transactions between service users and serviceproviders that are in both parties' interests, thus internaliz- ing what would otherwise be an externality. The basic logicof the approach is illustrated in figure 2.3.Innovative Marketing Arrangements: Payments for Environmental ServicesNOTE 2.3 Conversion to pasture Conservation Payment for service$/ha Benefits to forest managers Costs to downstream populationsConservation with service payment Source: Pagiola and Platais (2007).Figure 2.3 The Simple Economics of Payments for Environmental Service86 CHAPTER 2: ENGAGING THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT The PES approach is attractive in that it generates new financing, which would not otherwise be available for conservation; it is likely to be sustainable because it depends on themutual self- interest of service users and providers andnot on government or donor funding; and it is likely to be efficient, in that it conserves serviceswhose benefits exceed the cost of providing them anddoes not conserve services when the opposite is true. PES programs are not limited to forests and can be used, in principle, to help induce the adoption of any land use that generates external benefits. The majority of PES pro-grams to date have focused on forests or agroforestry, however. There has been considerable experimentation with PES and other market- based approaches in recent years. LatinAmerica has been a particularly fertile ground for suchexperimentation. Costa Rica established an elaborate, nationwide PES program, the Pago por Servicios Ambientales (PSA) Program, in 1997. Mexico created a similar program, the Pago por Servicios Ambientales Hidrol\u00f3gicos (PSAH) Pro- gram, in 2003. Both of these programs focus on forests.There have also been a wide range of subnational initiatives,with municipal water supply systems, hydropower produc-ers, irrigation water user associations, bottlers, and otherwater users paying for the services they receive, eitherthrough national programs, such as Costa Rica's PSA orthrough self- standing PES mechanisms. Pilot efforts are alsoemerging in other regions. The World Bank has been active in supporting PES pro- grams. In fiscal 2007, several projects had explicit PES com- ponents under implementation or preparation (table 2.2). The prospect for implementation of PES projects varies across the main services generated by forests: Hydrological services. Water services are often the most promising for actually generating payment streams. The users of water services are typically easy to identify, receive well- defined benefits, and stand to suffer substantially ifwater services were to be curtailed. However, water servicesare very site specific, meaning that some areas will havesubstantial potential for payments, and others almost none.Water users do not use generic \"water services\"; they areinterested in very specific ones. Depending on the nature ofthe user, some will be primarily concerned about waterquality, others about dry- season flow, and others aboutflood risk or sediment loads. This often eases the task ofunderstanding service provision in individual cases because efforts can focus on the specific dimensions of interest. Biodiversity conservation. The potential for PES for biodiversity conservation is limited because of the difficulty of identifying service users and of charging them. Nevertheless, biodiversity conservation has been a major theme of many PESprojects, usually with support from the Global EnvironmentFacility (GEF). This has usually taken the form of helpingfinance the up- front costs of establishing PES mechanisms that will then depend on payments by water users, as suchmechanisms are also likely to generate biodiversity benefits.Although GEF cannot provide the long- term funding streamthat is necessary for PES, in some cases it has supported theestablishment of trust funds that can generate such funding. Carbon sequestration. Carbon sequestration has limited potential, because of the restrictions imposed on land- use and land- use change (LULUCF) projects under the currentrules of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The Bank's BioCarbon Fund has been working to develop CDM- compliant LULUCF projects, as well as emerging and newapproaches. Carbon sequestration projects will not bediscussed further in this note, but are addressed thoroughlyin a separate sourcebook on the topic (World Bank CarbonFinance Unit, n.d.). Scenic beauty. Payments for scenic beauty may potentially be generated from \"users,\" such as the tourism industry, but this has not been done to date. This potential is beingexplored in the Mexico PES project. OPERATIONAL ASPECTS The process of designing a PES mechanism for forests can be broken into several steps: identifying and quantifying environmental services charging service users paying service providers creating an appropriate organizational and institutional structure Identifying and quantifying environmental services Implementing PES approaches requires that the servicesthat are desired are clearly identified and that the effect ofdifferent land uses on these services be understood and quantified to the extent possible. NOTE 2.3: INNOVATIVE MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS: PAYMENTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES 87Hydrological services. While forests are widely believed to provide a variety of hydrological services, the evidence is often far from clear (see box 2.13). This partly reflects the diversity of conditions encountered: hydrological services, for example, depend on the rainfall regime, on the type of soil, and ontopography. Deforestation and afforestation can havemultiple, often contradictory impacts, making the net impacton water services hard to determine. For example, infiltration can be reduced, but water use can also be reduced throughevapotranspiration. The net impact of these changes (both intotal and within a year) depends on the balance between theseeffects. Moreover, much depends on post- logging land use.The objectives also influence the analysis: Efforts to regulate waterflows to avoid flooding and dry season deficits may require different interventions than efforts to maximize totalwater volume, and the measures required to conservebiodiversity may be different from either. Moreover, even if the kind of benefit that a forest generates is known, one must alsoknow how much of that benefit is being generated. Maintaining or regenerating forest cover imposes opportunity costs from the forgone land use and may also impose directcosts (for example, for reforestation). Without estimates of theamounts of benefits that would be generated, determiningwhether these costs are worth bearing is difficult. Biodiversity conservation. Although in some ways biodiversity is much harder to measure than water services, adequate indicators can be developed relatively easily inpractice. These can include, for example, counts of thenumber of species of conservation interest, or of speciesthat are particularly sensitive to ecosystem conditions, andof the number of individuals within these species.Table 2.2 World Bank Projects with Explicit PES Components T otal cost World Bank loan GEF grant Country, project (US$ million) Main features Completed projects Costa Rica: Ecomarkets 49.2 32.6 8.0 Effective 2001-05.

Amounts shown for projects under preparation are preliminary and subject to change; for projects with PES components, amounts r eflect overall project costs, not PES- specific costs.Charging service users It is sometimes asserted that water users will never pay for services. This assertion is manifestly false. In Costa Rica, avariety of water users (hydroelectric producers, bottlers, municipal water supply systems, agribusinesses, hotels) are paying to conserve the watersheds from which theydraw their water, generating about US$500,000 annuallyin payments. Other examples exist throughout Centraland South America, and in South Africa. In Kenya, the Nairobi Water Company has indicated its willingness inprinciple to pay for watershed protection. The principalchallenge is to demonstrate to users that they will, in fact,benefit from making such payments, by reducing oravoiding costs from reduced water services. Nairobi Water, for example, is currently spending about US$150,000 a year in additional water treatment anddesilting costs at its Sasumua treatment plant as a result ofupstream degradation. In general, the primary interlocutors in such discus- sions are not the ultimate consumers of the water servicesbut the companies and public agencies that generatehydropower, provide domestic water services, or distributeirrigation water. In many cases, funding for paymentscomes from the existing budgets of these agencies. Thus,Nairobi Water would finance payments for upstream con-servation from the savings resulting from reduced costs at its treatment plant. Only in rare instances is it necessary toincrease fees to consumers to pay for PES. In thoseinstances, experience has shown that this can be achievedwith public support if the need for and use of the revenueare clearly explained. As noted above, charging biodiversity users is difficult if not impossible. Most available funding from biodiversityusers (for example, from the GEF) is short term, limiting its use to paying for the up- front costs of PES mechanismestablishment or to capitalization of a trust fund. Paying service providers For PES to have the desired effect, the payments must reachthe land users and do so in a way that motivates them tochange their land use decisions. This is not easy. The histor- ical record is replete with examples of efforts to induce land users to adopt particular land use practices, for a variety ofreasons and using a variety of payment mechanisms. Mosthave very little to show for their efforts. In general, several principles are clear: P ayments need to be ongoing. The benefits being sought are generally ongoing benefits, which will be enjoyed year after year as long as appropriate land uses are maintained.For this to occur, land users must receive payments as longas they maintain the land use. All too often, payments havebeen frontloaded into a few years. Predictably, however,when payments cease, any leverage over land users' behavioralso ceases. Payments need to be targeted. Environmental services depend on both the kind of land use and its location. An undifferentiated payment system that pays everyone thesame will be much more expensive than a targeted scheme.It will also make it difficult to tailor interventions to theparticular requirements of given situations. Perverse incentives need to be avoided. Particular care needs to be taken to avoid perverse incentives.

Creating the institutional framework Scale of project. A critical initial question concerns the scale of the PES mechanism. There are, in principle, threebroad scales at which PES could be implemented: (1) nationwide, (2) at the scale of a river basin, and (3) locally, usually at the scale of a microwatershed. In practice,although there are some high- profile national systems (inCosta Rica and Mexico), almost all existing mechanisms areat the local scale. There are no river basin-scale programs. Nationwide systems may appear attractive because they cancover large areas quickly and can have relatively low costsbecause of economies of scale. Experience has shown thatsuch systems tend to be very inefficient, however. They areeasily distorted by political considerations and exhibit low transaction costs mainly because they sidestep the difficult questions. Local initiatives are more likely to be efficientbecause they tend to be closely tailored to local needs andconditions. However, they often are constrained by limitedlocal capacity. The El Salvador Environmental ServicesProject is exploring an intermediate approach, in whichlocal mechanisms are being developed under a nationwide umbrella. Legal framework. PES programs are often thought to require a specific legal framework. They only do so if they are to be based on public financing, in which case a legal framework is desirable so that the payment program is notwholly at the mercy of annual budgetary decisions. Relyingon public financing is, however, generally an undesirableapproach to PES. PES programs that are based on paymentsfrom service users do not require any specific law, otherthan general contract law. There may be a need for legalreform to remove obstacles, however. For example, publicutilities may be restricted in their ability to chargeconsumers for the costs of conservation, or in their ability touse available funding in PES mechanisms. Functions to be accomplished. Systems of payments for environmental services require a supporting institutional infrastructure. This can take many forms, but several commonfunctions must be accomplished (see figure 2.4).Organizationally, the most complex task to be undertaken ispaying service providers because agents must be sent into thefield, with all the logistical issues that entails. This task canoften be subcontracted to NGOs or other agencies that alreadyhave a field presence, but sometimes it may be necessary to establish new organizations to undertake this task. Ensuring the poor benefit PES programs are not poverty- reduction instruments, but given the often high spatial correlation between areas thatprovide environmental services and areas of high poverty, PES programs may contribute to poverty reduction, at least locally. Guidelines are available on how to design PES pro-grams to maximize their positive impact on the poor andminimize any potential negative impacts. For example, insome countries, even within a community, benefits may be captured by local elites at the expense of the poor. T oaddress this issue, capacity needs to be built to empower thepoor and vulnerable groups in the community. Because some participants may be indigenous groups, it may be necessary to prepare an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) or an Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPFP). However, because PES programs are largely volun-tary, these safeguards are triggered mainly in cases with col-lective decision making on land use and the use of PES rev-enues (see chapter 12, Applying OP 4.10 on IndigenousPeoples, in section II of this sourcebook). Other operational considerations Project type. PES projects can generally take two forms: Projects entirely dedicated to PES, which typically work on a nationwide basis (as in Costa Rica and Mexico). PES components within a broader project. Such PEScomponents could be part of a variety of projects. Obvi-ous examples include watershed management and sus- tainable land management projects (as in the Kenya KAPSLM (Kenya Agricultural Productivity and Sustain-able Land Management), but there is also significantpotential to undertake PES as part of institutional reformprojects or water infrastructure projects (the Brazil Espirito Santo Project is partially blended with a domes-tic water supply project in the town of Vitoria). Avoiding perverse incentives. PES projects do not support any clearing or degradation of forests or othernatural habitats. On the contrary, they are intended topromote the conservation and restoration of forests andother natural habitats. PES projects, therefore, are usuallyfully compatible with both the World Bank's NaturalHabitats OP/BP 4.04 and the Forests OP/BP 4.36. The main risk is of unintended, perverse consequences, such as land users clearing forest to qualify for reforestation payments or moving into previously intact ecosystems to claim payments for managing them correctly. These prob- lems can generally be avoided by instituting appropriate eli-gibility criteria for participation, setting appropriate condi-tions for payments, and instituting effective monitoringsystems (see box 2.14). LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS PES programs are not a universal answer to all forest con- servation problems. Even when PES approaches are war-ranted, the details of their application will differ substan-tially from case to case, in light of local technical, economic, and institutional conditions. Identifying the services sought is critical, and most effectively done by focusing on the demand for servicesand asking how best to meet it, rather than on the supply.Beginning from the supply side carries the risk of devel- oping mechanisms that supply the wrong services, in thewrong places, or at prices that buyers are unwilling to pay. The land uses that can generate the services sought must then be identified and their impact quantified to the extent possible. Monitoring effectiveness is essential to documenting to buyers that they are getting what they are paying for and toadjusting the functioning of the mechanism should prob- lems arise. At the same time, excessively burdensome moni-toring requirements can discourage potential supplierswithout necessarily further reassuring buyers. Finding theright balance between information and compliance costs is an ongoing concern, as seen in the case of markets for certi-fied timber and agricultural products. PES mechanisms must also be sufficiently flexible to respond to changing demand and supply conditions andimprovements in knowledge about how forests generate services.

World Bank, Washington, DC.As a result of significant increases in demand for wood, the global wood market is undergoingrapid changes, putting considerable and increas- ing pressure on the world's remaining natural forests. Without significant investment in promoting sustainableforest management (SFM) efforts and in plantation man-agement, it must be expected that, especially in manyWorld Bank client countries, increasing demand for wood will lead to further degradation and fragmentation offorests and permanent deforestation. T o successfullychange this situation, international wood demand must bemet through sustainable wood production from naturalforests and plantation management. T o facilitate such a process, markets must increasingly adopt mechanisms that not only ensure sustainable forestry and conservation, butalso provide satisfactory livelihood opportunities for for-est-dependent communities, and promote sustainable eco-nomic development for all nations, including countrieswith low forest cover. Therefore, the sustainable productionof wood to meet increasing demand will continue to play apredominant role in the discussion of how to achieveglobal targets for forest management. Economic processes have always relied on wood, and access to and exploitation of it have shaped economic struc-tures. The exploitation of wood for subsistence uses for energy or construction material, or for commercial use inlocal, regional, and global markets, were among the firstobjectives of managing forest resources through humanintervention. See box 3.1 for definitions of several commer- cial wood products. Even though managing forests has become more com- plex over the past decades because of a wider range of man- agement objectives than just wood production (for exam-ple, biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration,recreation, and tourism), the core problems and challengesoften remain similar. The exploitation of wood for subsis- tence use and commercialization at nonsustainable levelsleads to forest degradation and destruction, which fre-quently constitutes the first step toward conversion offorests to other land uses and, thus, permanent deforesta-tion dynamics (see figure 3.1). This sequence of events has become a major concern to resource managers in recent years because the constantlygrowing demand for wood, particularly by emergingeconomies like Brazil, China, India, and South Africa, isstrongly affecting forests and forest-dependent people inproducer countries. For example, in China total forest-product imports rose from 40 million cubic meters (m 3) to almost 150 million m3between 1997 and 2005. It is expected that demand, both domestic and from outside the country, will continue to rise, and forest-product imports to China are likely to double within the next 10 years.1This development has strong impacts on markets in other coun- tries in which forest management standards often are not yet as stringent as generally required by consumer coun- tries.2Many of these countries are World Bank client coun- 93Meeting the Growing Demand for Forest Products: Plantation Forestry andHarvesting Operations in Natural ForestsCHAPTER 3tries, and supporting these countries in meeting interna- tional standards for responsible forest management andgood governance constitutes one of the biggest challenges for World Bank operations in the forestry sector. For exam- ple, forests in eastern Siberia in the Russian Federation arethe primary suppliers of wood to meet China's rapidlygrowing demand. Because many of the traditional supplymarkets are starting to experience resource shortages, the growing demand for wood currently focuses on theexploitation of the last remaining natural reserves, forexample, in the Congo Basin and the Amazon. It is thereforevery likely that roundwood production in tropical countrieswill still increase in regions with natural forests. If demand for wood cannot be met through sustainable supplies, forest degradation and deforestation will continueor even accelerate; thus, other management objectives, suchas biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, and poverty alleviation are equally threatened. The increase indemand for wood and the resulting policy uncertainties and other sensitivities, paired with an increase in market prices, triggers another important factor contributing to these neg-ative trends: illegal logging (see note 5.5, Addressing IllegalLogging, for further discussion), which is a serious threat tosustainable management of forest resources and, hence, to sustainable development in general. Between 1997 and2002, estimates of illegally harvested timber in SoutheastAsia alone amounted to more than 80 million m 3. Based on the factors presented in box 3.2, the global demand for wood is expected to continue to grow in the years to come. While there has been little or no recent change in Europe and North America, deforestation is of great concern in many other parts of the world, especially in many Africancountries. According to the Food and Agriculture Organiza-tion (FAO) of the United Nations, the annual global defor- estation rate is presently estimated to be about 0.2 percent(FAO 2006). In the period 1990-2000, this translated into anet loss of 95 million hectares (ha) of forests\u2014an area largerthan the Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela. The loss of161 million ha of natural forests to deforestation was some- what offset by 15 million ha of afforestation (the deliberate creation of forests where none existed), 36 million ha of nat-ural expansion of forests, and 15 million ha of reforestation.These trends are critical because they lead to a decreasingsupply of wood from natural forests, especially consideringthat productivity rates of natural forests are declining, too,because of overexploitation and insufficient management 94 CHAPTER 3: MEETING THE GROWING DEMAND FOR FOREST PRODUCTSWood includes roundwood, wood fuel, industrial roundwood, sawnwood, veneer sheets, and plywood. Roundwood is wood obtained from removal, har- vesting, and felling from forests and trees outside for- est. It includes roundwood generally classified as woodfuel (fuelwood and charcoal) (sawlogs pulpwood, round andsplit; and other industrial roundwood). Wood fuel is roundwood used for fuel consumption such as cooking, heating, or power production. Industrial roundwood is roundwood used for indus- trial production of other goods and services except as a source of energy. It includes several products: sawlogsand veneer logs (production of sawnwood or railway sleepers and veneer sheets, respectively); pulpwood,round and split (pulp, particleboard, or fiberboard); and other industrial roundwood (for tanning, distilla- tion, poles, and so forth). Sawnwood is wood that has been produced from domestic and imported roundwood, either by sawinglengthways or by a profile-chipping process. Veneer sheets are thin sheets of wood of uniform thickness, peeled, sliced, or sawn. Plywood is a panel consisting of an assembly of veneer sheets bonded together with the direction of the grain in alternate plies, generally at right angles.Box 3.1 T echnical Definitions Source: FAO 2005b. Figure 3.1 Pathways of Land Cover Conversion Primary forestSecondary forestAgricultural landDegraded landinterventions. Without further investments in improving the productivity of natural forests and establishing planta-tion forestry to meet future demands, it can be expected that supplies are only available for a limited number of years. Table 3.1 presents such estimations for selected countries. The projected impact of the increase in the global demand for wood\u2014especially from emerging economies 3 as major new processing and consumption markets\u2014is, however, only one factor causing forest degradation anddeforestation. At present, the conversion of forest land to other land uses, such as agriculture and urbanization, is by far the biggest factor for the continued degradation, frag-mentation, and destruction of natural forest area in WorldBank client countries and has a strong impact on the reduc-tion in wood supply (illustrated in figure 3.1). While such dynamics are generally discussed with regard to theirimpacts on global forest market developments, theirimpacts on local and regional markets are equally impor-tant, with strong negative effects on local livelihoods andprovision of local and global environmental services. The global demand for wood fibers has complemented the increase in the demand for roundwood and timberproducts, with industry alone expected to need 1.9 billionm 3per year by 2015. Fast-growing plantations will be relied upon as a key element in meeting future demand for fiber. This shift of focus from natural forests to plantations forpulpwood production is partly due both to their greater economic competitiveness and to environmental concernover declining natural forest cover. Another significant contributor to the increase in round- wood consumption emerges from local and regional use ofwood fuels, that is, fuelwood and charcoal. This aspectdeserves particular attention because of its strong povertylink in many World Bank client countries (see table 3.2). At the global level, the number of people living on less than $1/day is about the same as the number of those lack-ing access to commercial energy: 2 billion people (FAOCOFO 2005). According to the World Bank (2004), about575 million people depend on wood fuels as a source ofenergy in Sub-Saharan Africa. The use of wood fuels is pre- CHAPTER 3: MEETING THE GROWING DEMAND FOR FOREST PRODUCTS 95Subsistence use of wood (wood fuel, construction material) population increase increase of absolute number of people living inpoverty, especially in rural areas increased role of forests as safety nets in emergencysituations (for example, harvest failures caused byeffects related to climate change dynamics) Domestic wood use (charcoal, especially in Africa, but also South Asia and Eastern Europe) population increase continued urbanization macroeconomic reforms, for example, tariff increases in the electricity sectorPulp and paper and industrial wood products population increase economic development in emerging-market anddeveloping economies High-value timber products increasing economic development, particularly inemerging-market economies (for example, Brazil,China, India, and South Africa) decrease of production forest area (natural forests),resulting in traditional net exporters turning intonet importers of timber and timber products (for example, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand) population increase Niche products (for example, nontimber forest prod-ucts [NTFPs], such as medicinal plants) population increase Box 3.2 Factors Influencing Future Demand for Wood Source: Sander 2007. Table 3.1 Estimated Number of Years Left of Economically Accessible Timber, by Country Country of origin Years Russia (far eastern region) > 20 Papua New Guinea 13-16 Myanmar 10-15Indonesia 10Cambodia 4-9 Source : Forest Trends 2006.dominant in both rural and urban locations, accounting for approximately 70 percent of total and 90 percent of house-hold energy use. On average, women carry 20 kilograms of fuelwood five kilometers every day. Commonly, a large number of traders are involved in buying, transporting, andreselling wood fuels; this is often where most of the valueadded is obtained in this mainly informal sector. As a consequence, with one of the primary causes of deforestation being exploitation of forests for wood fuels, the use of wood fuels constitutes one of the most pressing chal-lenges for achieving SFM in almost all Sub-Saharan Africanand other World Bank client countries (including in SouthAsia, East Asia, and Central America). The most important factor that will cause this challenge to persist for years to come is the considerable population growth in these coun-tries (see box 3.2 for other factors). For example, Sub-Saha-ran Africa has one of the world's fastest growing populations(increasing by about 2.2 percent a year) and is expected to behome to more than a billion people by 2025 (compare withnumbers in table 3.2). It is estimated that if current trendscontinue, many areas, especially the Sudano-Sahelian belt,will experience a severe shortage of fuelwood by 2025. Again,it must be emphasized that while the wood fuel challenge ismost apparent and urgent in Sub-Saharan Africa, it appliesequally to other regions where forest resource management is an important component in the World Bank's investmentportfolio for achieving rural development and poverty allevi-ation. Even though some of these trends may be compensatedfor through the adoption of alternative energy sources, suchas natural gas and biofuels, it is expected that the overall trendwill lead to increases in wood fuel consumption over the next15 to 20 years. It is also important to acknowledge that the wood fuel challenge generally exists in countries that arecommonly not regarded as important forest countries forWorld Bank operations, but countries with low forest coveror low forest resource stocks and productivity rates (forexample, savannah woodlands, Miombo forest ecosystems). As a result of the increase in demand for wood, market pressure has been increasingly directed toward plantationforestry. Countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China,Indonesia, and South Africa are expected to becomeincreasingly important world producers of pulpwood andindustrial softwood for mass consumption through planta- tion forestry with exotic, fast-growing tree species. In addition, wood fuel production in particular, but also larger-scale industrial production of wood, can be achievedthrough bottom-up approaches such as community wood-lots, agroforestry, outgrower schemes, and company- community partnerships instigating economic opportunitiesat the household level (see notes 2.1, Community- PrivatePartnerships, and 2.2, Small and Medium Enterprises). Manyof these interventions can also help regain degraded lands for economic productivity with positive effects reaching beyondsustainable wood production, for example, provision of envi-ronmental services. However, at this moment, certain wood,especially high-value timber species, can only be produced from natural forests; plantation forestry cannot yet be substi-tuted for these sources of supply. Given the long productionprocess wood requires, it is obvious that the stage has to beprepared right now for addressing\u2014and meeting\u2014futuresupply shortages from natural forests through plantationforestry. Another management intervention for increasingthe wood supply in the future is to increase the productionlevel of secondary and primary forests, providing the possi-bility for secondary forests to redevelop into primary for-est-like ecosystems (see figure 3.1). Last, a newly emerging factor is anticipated to have an impact on wood supply in the future: climate change.Changing climate regimes are expected to shift the currentallocation of forest areas, leading not only to changes to andpotential decline of natural forest areas, but also changingregimes for plantation establishment. Under climatechange, production from plantations that have been estab-lished to date could decrease significantly, for example,through increasing climate variability and a higher proba- bility of extreme climate events, such as droughts, initiatingforest fires and increasing the vulnerability of trees toinsects and disease. These effects are largely theoretical, butneed to be explored and closely monitored in coming yearsto develop appropriate adaptation strategies. 96 CHAPTER 3: MEETING THE GROWING DEMAND FOR FOREST PRODUCTSTable 3.2 Wood Fuel Data for Selected World Bank Client Countries, 2005 T otal Wood fuel forest area Population consumption (thousand ha) (thousand) (thousand m3) Chad 11,921 : FAO 2006; FAO 2007. In summary, the global market for wood is characterized by considerable and increasing pressure on the world's remaining natural forests. Without significant investment in promoting sustainable management of natural forests and in plantation management, especially in many World Bankclient countries, further degradation, fragmentation, anddestruction of natural forests can be expected. T o success-fully change this situation, the wood market must be trans- formed into one that ensures sustainable forestry and con-servation, provides satisfactory livelihood opportunities forforest-dependent communities, and promotes sustainableeconomic development. The Global Vision for Forest 2050 Project, which brought together leading experts, nongovernmental organizations(NGOs), industry representatives, and donor institutions,yielded the scenario depicted in figure 3.2 for a globalclosed-forest area of 3 billion ha in 2050. This would resultin an increase in community-owned and -managed forestsand a significant increase in protected areas as defined bythe World Conservation Union (more formally known asthe International Union for the Conservation of Nature andNatural Resources, or IUCN). The area of state and privateproduction forests under intensive management wouldremain roughly the same as at present, and industrial plan-tation forests would increase slightly, from 95 million to 100 million hectares. These developments will have a significant impact on how the World Bank\u2014together with its development part- ners\u2014can engage in forest management to develop feasible solutions to address these challenges. In a broad sense, this engagement can be put into practice in two ways: (i)through operational work directly supporting governmentsand industry in their efforts to use the potential of sustain-able wood production from natural forests and plantations to foster economic development and achieve poverty allevi-ation, and (ii) through analytical work, ensuring up-to-dateknowledge management and dissemination. PAST ACTIVITIES The initial rationale for the World Bank to engage in the forestry sector in the 1970s was based on addressing world-wide declining wood supplies and the dependence of the rural poor on wood energy. T o meet these objectives, early projects promoted industrial-scale forest plantations withan emphasis on forest engineering components (plantbreeding, fast-growing species, plantation establishment,and the like). One common feature during this period was that the forest service was assigned a policing and control-ling role, enforcing forest laws with the main objective ofkeeping people out of state-owned forest reserves and plan-tations. The involvement of rural people in forestry waslimited to being a source of labor. The early 1980s began with a shift toward greater partic- ipation by stakeholders and community involvement. TheWorld Bank started to promote the importance of commu-nity mobilization in stabilizing forest resources and improv-ing the incomes of forest-dependent communities. Themain objective of this change was to link investment inforestry with poverty alleviation and environmental protec-tion efforts. Following a period of strong criticism from civil society organizations, especially environmental NGOs, whoregarded World Bank investments as strong contributors toglobal deforestation dynamics, the Bank's engagement in productive forest management decreased significantly. As aconsequence, in the 1990s the World Bank's forest policyand Bank operational activit ies focused mainly on projects aimed at the conservation of biodiversity. In 2002 the World Bank adopted its current forest policy, which provides the opportunity to reengage in industrial-scale forest management when such investments are certi-fied under an independent forest certification system that isacceptable to the World Bank. 4This development resulted from the intervention of environmental NGOs that consid- CHAPTER 3: MEETING THE GROWING DEMAND FOR FOREST PRODUCTS 97Protected areas (IUCN categories I-IV) Multiple use forests under community-based forest management State forests and private woodlands managed primarily for timber production Plantation forest management primarily for fiber and timber production100 million hectares 1,200 million hectares 1,200 million hectares500 million hectaresFigure 3.2 A Possible Global Forest Scenario for 2050ered it important to have the World Bank as an active stake- holder and partner promoting responsible forest manage-ment, especially given the scale of World Bank investments and the potential for addressing cross-sectoral issues of for- est management and sustainable wood production. Between 2002 and 2005, the World Bank ran approxi- mately 29 projects with components that focused on meet-ing the growing demand for wood. 5T otal lending associated with these projects was approximately US$282 million, which constituted about 40 percent of the lending on forests during this period. Of this amount, a large portion was invested in projects involving community participation inplantation and commercial harvesting, approximatelyUS$55 million was invested in projects involving main-streaming biodiversity considerations, and approximately US$10 million was allocated to forest certification systems. KEY ISSUES Meet the increasing demand for wood. Plantation forestry will become more important in meeting the grow- ing demand for wood (see note 3.3). From 1995 to 2000, global forest plantation area increased from 120 million ha to about 170 million ha (116 million of which are located inAsia). 6In Brazil alone, forest plantation area increased from 500,000 ha in 1966 to 3.7 million ha in 1979, to 10.5 million ha in 2005 (Del Lungo, Ball, and Carle 2006). Over the past 15 years, the share of industrial fiber from plantations has grown from 5 percent to 30 percent compared to nativeforests, but in some countries the share is much higher(FAO 1995a). T oday, plantation forestry plays a significant role for wood production, especially in tropical countries, because of several important characteristics including high yield,short rotations, and accessibility. Although some planta-tions are for protection purposes, most are for production(FAO 2006), and plantations' share in providing roundwood to industry is growing. Plantation forestry is also increas- ingly changing from large-scale investments in monocul-tures to small-scale investments in which local householdsand communities are the principle owners of the means ofproduction, not just employed as laborers (see chapter 2,Engaging the Private Sector in Forest Development, and itsassociated notes, and note 3.3, Forest Plantations). Avoid cross-sector policy impacts on sustainable management of forests. Threats to the long-term sus- tainable management of natural forests have generally comefrom decisions regarding alternative land uses, not from alack of technical knowledge about SFM (for example, in theagricultural sector and in infrastructure, such as building ofroads and dams). Such cross-sectoral policy impacts mustbe further analyzed and increasingly brought to the atten-tion of policy makers and relevant stakeholders so they candesign and strengthen policy interventions at the macrolevel that address these issues (for example, agriculturalpolicies, road building, and the like). In this context, proj-ects primarily designed for improving forest managementin World Bank client countries must increasingly have theircross-sectoral effects taken into consideration (see detaileddiscussion in chapter 6, Mainstreaming Forests into Devel-opment Policy and Planning: Assessing Cross-SectoralImpacts), thus making cooperation with other sectors nec-essary. The World Bank concurrently should furtherimprove the way in which forest considerations are inte-grated into projects developed in nonforest sectors (forexample, the infrastructure and energy sectors). Last, the World Bank could enhance its engagement in internationalpolicy efforts that address these cross-sectoral impacts, per-haps by engaging proactively in international initiatives,such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and others. Another example in which policies have negatively affected forest management in World Bank client countries is the tropical timber import ban executed by several West-ern countries in the 1980s and 1990s. The import ban exac-erbated the problem it was trying to address by shifting the terms of trade away from products derived from naturalforests, thus further reducing the incentive to avoid conver-sion to other land uses. Since then, innovative tools, such asindependent forest certification, have been developed to permit access of wood and timber products to high-priceconsumer markets in Western Europe and North America ifthey are proven to be in compliance with internationallyaccepted management standards. The high prices gainedfrom these markets make management interventions in nat-ural and plantation forests requiring additional invest-ments\u2014such as reduced-impact logging or the rehabilita-tion of degraded forests\u2014economically feasible andcontribute to achieving sustainable wood production in thefuture. In light of these developments, future activities needto focus on reducing transaction costs for forest certifica-tion, especially for smallholder producers, and to support-ing their efforts to increase the marketing potential for theirproducts and their access to high-price markets. Independ-ent certification may also lead, in some cases, to a reevalua-tion of export ban policies in producer countries for high-value certified roundwood if domestic prices cannot 98 CHAPTER 3: MEETING THE GROWING DEMAND FOR FOREST PRODUCTScompete with prices that could be obtained in international markets. In this context, innovative marketing systems, auc-tioning of logs, for instance, need to be further developed and should include improvements in transparency and accountability. Develop incentives for sustainable management of natural forests and forest plantations. In contrast to policies negatively affecting sustainable management of nat-ural forests, policies can also be designed to provide eco-nomic incentives to invest in responsible forest manage-ment. For example, land tenure reform can play a significantrole in improving the security of returns on investment inSFM, thus augmenting incentives to participate. This isespecially important for motivating small-scale farmers andcommunities to make investments in forestry (see note 1.4,Property and Access Rights). Another example of such pos-itive policy interventions are tax incentives for forestryoperators that undergo independent forest certification,which may cause higher transaction costs for forest man-agement. Providing a framework that facilitates secure con-tractual arrangements between various stakeholders in for-est management can equally encourage investments inresponsible forest management. Complementary invest-ments in research and development also often provide theplatform upon which improvements in the field can be real- ized (for example, silvicultural techniques, nurseryimprovements, species variations, knowledge generation onlesser-known species, and the like). Often, these costs arenot taken over by private investors, but have to be taken upthrough public expenditures instigating improved andincreased investments in forestry. Balance wood production with demands for biodi- versity conservation. Various benefits can be realized from integrating conservation and production (see note 3.1,Mainstreaming Biodiversity Considerations into ProductiveLandscapes). Three key benefits are (i) improving the feasi-bility of achieving conservation goals by using productionand protected areas, (ii) increasing the benefits from con-servation by conserving parts of forests adjacent to pro-tected areas, and (iii) improving the overall ownership andunderstanding of conservation. Reduce wood processing overcapacity. In some areas, processing capacity has been created that exceeds the sus- tainable wood production of the region. This problemoccurs mainly in southern countries, where raw material isoften provided at subsidized, below-market prices to furtherpromote investment in forest industries to create employ- ment. This overcapacity has resulted in pressure to keepfeeding the mills to make back the capital investment. Many of these facilities, however, are now being closed down. Use secondary forests for increasing wood produc- tion. The management of secondary forests presents both a challenge and an opportunity. Tropical countries have seen an increase in wood production from secondary forestsbecause these areas are increasing dramatically, and in somecountries now exceed the area covered by primary forests.Reliance on secondary forests is expected to increase aslarger primary forest areas are designated as protected forests. Secondary forests are a good source of wood fibers, NTFPs, social and environmental services, and other goods.The potential of lesser-known species has to be furtherexplored, 7and forest management should start to focus on these forests, steering wood production to shift gradually from primary to secondary forests. Secondary forests, there- fore, have great potential to contribute to global wood demand (see figure 3.2). Independent certification of forest management. Independent certification provides proof that forest man-agers are using good management practices, adhering tointernationally agreed principles and criteria (see note, 3.2,Forest Certification Systems). The development of forestcertification systems and schemes emerged from stridentattempts to ban imports of tropical timber, brought forwardin the 1980s and 1990s by advocacy groups in North Amer-ica and Western Europe. Certification was conceived as amarket-based instrument, aimed at rewarding good forestmanagement by improving or maintaining access to high-price consumption markets. 8The final destinations for these products have, in the past, mainly been Western Europe, Japan, and North America, but increasingly, the emerging economies of Brazil, China, India, and Russia serve as destinations. Many of the emerging economiesoften only harbor the main processing and transformationfacilities and export the final consumer products to high-value markets that increasingly demand certification as proof of good management practices. This is made possibleby chain-of-custody certification, which, in most systems,complements forest management certification and providesa tool for tracking certified timber throughout the supplychain. One of the key issues to address is the development of mechanisms to make certification economically attractivefor small-scale forest management and timber processing CHAPTER 3: MEETING THE GROWING DEMAND FOR FOREST PRODUCTS 99operations (such as community-based forest management) that mainly produce for local and regional markets and donot necessarily have the ability to capture the benefits of high-value markets. Larger scale forest operations that do not produce for high-value market segments are anothertarget. Ensure that production forests provide environmen- tal services while supporting local livelihoods. With the amendment of the Kyoto Protocol in 2005, plantationsare expected to increasingly act as carbon sinks in many car-bon credit projects, so that in addition to improving marketsfor forest products, developing countries will benefit from the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change(see note 2.3, Innovative Marketing Arrangements for Envi-ronmental Services, and note 3.1, Mainstreaming Conserva-tion Considerations into Productive Landscapes). Brazilianeucalypts plantations provide a good example of an attemptto maintain biodiversity: High-yielding cloned stands areseparated by strips and blocks of protected conservationareas along sensitive regions, such as creeks and rivers.NTFPs, of great importance to local people, also may be inte-grated into plantation forestry operations. NTFPs includingmedicinal plants, rattan and bamboo production, rubber tapping, resins, and beekeeping are often a significant com-ponent of the forestry operation. Again, facilitating inde-pendent forest certification, especially for smallholderforestry, for natural forest and plantation management willcontribute to achievement of this goal, ensuring that multi-dimensional management objectives are simultaneouslyachieved (see note 3.2, Forest Certification Systems). Embed Forest Law Enforcement and Governance ini- tiatives into productive forest management and tim-ber and wood product trade. Illegal activities, enabled and fueled by the absence of effective legislation and man-agement or their enforcement, are a leading factor in theloss of forests and the degradation of the resources and thusseriously endanger sustainable development. (See chapter 5,Improving Forest Governance, and note 5.5, AddressingIllegal Logging.) Design appropriate contractual arrangements to facilitate partnerships between different stake-holders. Reallocation of land ownership to smaller owners is expected to prevent large-scale wood clearing. However,in some countries, such as New Zealand and South Africa,planted forests have been privatized; several other countriesin Africa have also taken steps toward private and commu- nity engagement. Company-community partnerships are apromising approach and are expanding in the forest sector. Such partnerships can help to reduce risk, achieve better returns to land, diversify income sources, and much more\u2014and therefore have the potential to contribute to the objec-tives of SFM and to economic development in rural areas(see note 2.1, Community-Private Partnerships). Channeling economic potential to the local level can contribute significantly to poverty alleviation, especially when these benefits emerge not only as labor opportunities,but also as access to all means of production. Economicincentives should be created for smallholders to engage in forest management and make investments in sustainable forestry. Both traditional and innovative 9economic mecha- nisms should be applied to capture the financial benefits and make them available at the local level. The growing worldwide demand for timber also presents an opportunity for the establishment of sustainably managed plantationswith the participation of smallholders, taking environmen-tal, ecological, and social requirements into consideration.Lessons learned from plantation forestry indicate that access to such land for poor rural households must be managed ina socially acceptable way to prevent the risk that the ruralpoor will not benefit. The same holds true for natural forestmanagement. Approaches must be designed that make eco-nomic sense to the rural poor, given their constraints and preferences. In this context, future engagement by the World Bank is needed to establish participatory land use and landtenure systems as a precondition for sustainable plantationforestry (see boxes 3.3 and 3.4). FUTURE PRIORITIES AND SCALING-UP ACTIVITIES Continue support for community-based forest man- agement systems. Pilot projects supported by others are important for the World Bank's operations, and demon- strate feasible approaches that can be scaled up to make a significant contribution to social, environmental, and eco-nomic objectives. The World Bank's support to community-based forest management systems is promising, with theaim of enabling local communities to manage their own resources, rehabilitate and protect forests, market forestproducts, and benefit from security of tenure. One of thepositive projects in line with this strategy is the Forestry Sec-tor Development Project for Vietnam, which involves small-scale farmers (see box 3.4). 100 CHAPTER 3: MEETING THE GROWING DEMAND FOR FOREST PRODUCTSEncourage expansion of wood supply by private and community forest owners. Global fiber supply is shifting toward the southern hemisphere and China. Possibilities need to be explored for World Bank forestry projects and investment policies to support International Finance Cor-poration (IFC) private sector forest plantation investmentin Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Ecuador, India, Indone-sia, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uruguay, and Vietnam (see also chapter 2, Engaging the Pri-vate Sector in Forest Sector Development). Developinginnovative approaches that facilitate certification of small-holder forest management, and improving access to high-price markets for certified small-scale producers, are regarded as important components. Facilitating sustainable management of natural forests. Improving and extending responsible forest man- agement according to the principles and criteria demandedby the World Bank's Operational Policy on Forests (OP4.36) is the principal entry point and vehicle by which theWorld Bank can improve forestry outcomes.T o meet futurewood demand, the productivity of natural forests that serveproduction purposes must be improved. Securing appropri-ate structure, balance, and composition of the flows ofresources into and out of the forestry sector is the most dif-ficult challenge to forestry in most World Bank client coun-tries. Achieving sustainable management of natural forestsrequires significant reinvestment of revenues received fromthe extraction of wood. Meaningful stakeholder consulta-tions also need to be maintained to ensure that sociallyendorsed goals and objectives are achieved (see also chapter10, Consultation and Communications in Forest Activities,and chapter 12, Applying OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples). Enhance technical capacity for natural forest man- agement and plantation development. The technical capacity in many World Bank client countries is not suffi-cient to meet internationally acceptable standards for SFM.This is often evident even in the lack of timely collectionand management of relevant and accurate data needed forforest management, such as forest area, forest types,resource stock inventories, growth and yield tables, biodi-versity mapping, and so forth. Research on lesser-knownspecies to increase management efficiency and productivity CHAPTER 3: MEETING THE GROWING DEMAND FOR FOREST PRODUCTS 101The Global Forest and Trade Network (GFTN), an initiative of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), hassupported the development of community-based forest management in Latin America (see also note 1.2, Community-Based Forest Management). Ini-tiatives have included capacity building for chain-of-custody tracking in the lowland tropical hard-wood forests of Peru, and the Nicaraguan Forest Finance Fund, a novel financial mechanism aimedat creating incentives for producers and processorsdedicated to responsible forest management andtrade. In Bolivia, the GFTN has been involved indeveloping a strategy for increasing the demandfor responsibly produced wood products, primar- ily from indigenous communities, via responsible purchase policies and related market links to man-ufacturers and other members of the GFTN (forexample, retailers in consumer countries).

T o this end, theproject's scope includes the following aspects: (i)improvement of the environment for sustainableforestry development and biodiversity conserva-tion; (ii) provision of attractive incentive packagesto mainly poor farming households to plant trees on a sustainable basis to generate additional income and employment; (iii) making small, com-petitive grants available for effectively managingpriority special-use forests of international impor-tance; (iv) establishment of a credit line for partic-ipating farmers; (v) enhancement of capacity andcapability at regional, provincial, and district lev-els; and (vi) establishment of support services tomonitor and evaluate impact and outcomes.Implementation of the project started in 2005. Source: World Bank 2004b.Box 3.4 The Forestry Sector Development Project for Vietnamalso needs to be extended in many countries. In addition, silvicultural knowledge as the basis for improving produc-tivity of natural forest management is weak in many World Bank client countries and constitutes a key area for future intervention. Effective dissemination mechanisms need tobe established, particularly when wood production is sup-posed to be increasingly channeled to smallholders. Improve cooperation with the conservation commu- nity. Given the trend toward greater reliance on forest plan- tations, an agreement is needed between the conservationcommunity and industry as to where and how plantationforests can be developed such that potentially negative social and environmental impacts are minimized. One way to achieve this cooperation may be by promoting the mappingof critical forest areas (for example, high conservation valueforest [see note 3.1, Mainstreaming Conservation Consider-ations into Productive Landscapes] and related approaches)and independent forest certification of plantation manage-ment (see note 3.2, Forest Certification Systems). Design plantations to provide multiple functions. Plantations will need to be designed so that they are able toprovide the multiple functions expected of SFM, in additionto supplying raw material to pulp and paper mills and other industrial processing. T o achieve this objective, furtherresearch will be needed to improve knowledge on silvicul-tural techniques, especially on growth performance ofindigenous tree species and approaches for creating mixed-species or uneven-aged plantation forestry that resemblesnear-natural forest ecosystems and, hence, has a higherdegree of provision of environmental service functions,such as biodiversity conservation. Improve procurement policies of World Bank client country governments. Governments should be encour- aged to increase the proportion of their forest product pur-chases that come from sources certified by systems andschemes that comply with internationally accepted criteriaand indicators for SFM (see note 3.2, Forest CertificationSystems). Support up-to-date systems for independent forest certi fi cation, including chain-of-custody certifica-tion. Producers of tropical timber are under increasing pressure to be able to document the origin of their products,whether to demonstrate legality or achieve sustainability offorest management. Without this ability, producers may be excluded from key segments of the market. Related to this isthe need to address \"leakages\" within the wood trade, such as through customs and other controls (see note 3.2, Forest Certification Systems, note 5.5, Addressing Illegal Logging,and chapter 2, Engaging the Private Sector in Forest SectorDevelopment, and its associated notes). NOTES 1. Different scenarios estimate that China's forest product imports will reach far higher levels, up to 600 million m3, should imports continue to rise as they did from 1997 through 2005. Eventually the point may be reached when limited supply, coupled with rising prices for raw materials, will stem further increases in wood imports. 2. An increasing number of consumer countries\u2014espe- cially in Europe\u2014are currently developing procurementstandards for the import of wood and forest products that often demand independent management and chain-of-custody certification according to internationally recog-nized principles and criteria (see also note 3.2, Forest Certi-fication Systems). 3. Emerging economies of particular interest in the con- text of this chapter include Brazil, China, India, Indonesia,Malaysia, South Africa, Thailand, and Vietnam. 4. For further information, please refer to the World Bank Forests Strategy (World Bank 2004a) and World Bank'sOperational Policy on Forests (OP 4.36). 5. This included projects emphasizing biodiversity consid- erations in forest plantations and productive landscapes,project components that develop forest certification sys-tems, and certification to prevent illegal trade of timber andforest products, arrangements for plantations, and so forth. 6. Successful (net) plantation area must be distinguished from total planted area. The failure rate is often in the rangeof 20-30 percent, or even higher; plantations in the Philip- pines have had a success rate of only 26 percent (FAO 2003). 7. Especially in Latin America and Southeast Asia, the knowledge about lesser-known species has improved signif-icantly. In Africa, research and knowledge disseminationregarding these species needs to be further supported. 8. Many consumer countries have developed, or are cur- rently developing, procurement guidelines that require cer-tification of wood products. 9.

First, conservation goals cannot always be fully achieved by using only protected areas. Critical biodiversity values and ecosystem services are also supported by many produc-tion forests. Many forests also have social and cultural val-ues that may not be appropriately dealt with through exclu- sionary protection but can often be taken into account inproduction forest management. Forest-dependent commu-nities are likely to have links to nearby forest areas so thatthe creation of a conservation area in another locationbrings few or no benefits. Second, promoting conservation friendly practices in production forests surrounding protected areas can greatlyenhance the benefits to conservation through a combinationof reducing the threats to the protected areas and increasingthe effective area covered. For example, threatened specieswithin protected areas may be able to use adjacent land tosupply some of their needs (such as food or shelter), thusincreasing the overall population the area can sustain. Third, addressing conservation within production areas makes conservation much more widely owned and under-stood. People involved in productive land uses begin tounderstand conservation and develop their own approaches to implementing it. In mainstreaming conservation, theseparation between conservation and production isremoved. Land users are mandated to consider how theiractions can benefit conservation, both in their own landand in the broader context\u2014a crucial extension. Although there are major differences among countries in percentage of forests declared protected, existing cover-age of protected areas globally 2is widely regarded as inad-equate to safeguard biodiversity for two reasons. First, thearea assigned to protection is small. The total area set asidefor conservation purposes is less than 12 percent of theearth's land surface (Brooks and others 2004). Second, pro-tected areas are often created in areas where no other pro-ductive land uses are possible, meaning that protectedareas tend to over-represent infertile, inaccessible, andoften low-biodiversity areas, and under-represent highlydiverse, productive ecosystems. They also often fail to takeaccount of areas that provide irreplaceable livelihoods toforest-dependent peoples and are critical to the identity ofunique human cultures. Although these problems are recognized, pressures on land are already high, and in many places there are few opportunities to expand protected areas or increase the rep-resentation of protected habitats. 3 Recently, the focus has shifted to improving the conser- vation of biological, social, and cultural values within a combination of protected and productive landscapes. The addition of production areas dramatically increases the area of land and the range of habitats in which some form ofconservation can be practiced, providing more opportuni-ties to address conservation priorities that are poorly repre-sented in protected areas. THE HCV CONCEPT\u2014WHY IT IS USEFUL FOR INTEGRATING CONSERVATION ANDPRODUCTION The High Conservation Value (HCV) concept provides a framework for identifying forest areas with special attrib-utes that make them particularly valuable for biodiversity or to local people (that is, High Conservation Value Forests, HCVF). The main objective of applying this framework isto design and implement appropriate management optionsfor the area of concern. Strengths of the concept include thefollowing:Mainstreaming Conservation Considerations into Productive Landscapes: Applying High-Conservation-Value T oolsNOTE 3.1 104The concept is designed to integrate production and pro- tection. Therefore, it does not preclude productive use of some or even all of the HCVF identified. Management prescriptions are developed based on the best way to pro- tect the values identified. The methodology is not prescriptive, but provides a framework for systematic identification of values andplanning for their protection. The HCV approach uses and builds on the findings of whatever conservation or land-use planning activities are already in place ratherthan replacing them. This makes it both more cost effi-cient and less threatening. The HCV framework places equal emphasis on environ- mental and social values and requires a consultativeapproach to identify critical values and areas and to reach management decisions. The concept is widely accepted and already integrated into the land-use planning frameworks of several nationsor regions and within sustainable natural resource man- agement standards and certification schemes. The HCVF concept was initially developed for use in for- est certification by the FSC in 1999. 4Six generic HCVs thata forest may contain or maintain were identified (see box 3.5) and the identification and protection of HCVFsbecame a requirement for FSC certification. It quicklybecame apparent that the concept could be useful not onlywithin forest certification, but also in a wider land-use con-text and it is now used for a range of situations. The HCV approach is applicable to a wide range of nat- ural resource management scenarios. It is used both withinthe certification context and more widely, to guide bothSFM within production forests, and land-use planning forresponsible production of natural resources. HCV is rou-tinely applied for developing management prescriptions tosupport conservation goals in production forests under theFSC and Malaysian Timber Certification Council certifica-tion schemes. Outside of certification, it is mainly beingused for land-use planning purposes, including identifica- tion of set-aside areas for total protection and plantationdesign. For SFM in natural forests, the HCV approach has proved to be a robust tool for undertaking forest land-useplanning that integrates conservation and production requirements. The output generally indicates areas needingtotal protection, areas needing specific management, and NOTE 3.1: MAINSTREAMING CONSERVATION CONSIDERATIONS INTO PRODUCTIVE LANDSCAPES 105High Conservation Value areas are critical areas in a landscape that need to be appropriately managed to maintain or enhance HCVs. There are six main types of HCV areas: HCV1: \" Areas containing globally, regionally, or nationally significant concentrations of biodiversityvalues (e.g., endemism, endangered species, refu- gia). \" For example, the presence of several globally threatened bird species within a Kenyan montane for-est. HCV2: \"Globally, regionally, or nationally significant large landscape-level areas where viable populationsof most if not all naturally occurring species exist innatural patterns of distribution and abundance. \" For example, a large tract of Mesoamerican flooded grass-lands and gallery forests with healthy populations ofHyacinth Macaw, Jaguar, Maned Wolf, and Giant Otter,as well as most smaller species.HCV3: \" Areas that are in or contain rare, threatened, or endangered ecosystems. \" For example, patches of a regionally rare type of freshwater swamp in an Aus- tralian coastal district. HCV4: \" Areas that provide basic ecosystem services in critical situations (for example, watershed protection,erosion control). \" For example, forest on steep slopes with avalanche risk above a town in the European Alps. HCV5: \" Areas fundamental to meeting basic needs of local communities (for example, subsistence,health). \" For example, key hunting or foraging areas for communities living at subsistence level in a Cam-bodian lowland forest mosaic. HCV6: \" Areas critical to local communities' tradi- tional cultural identity (areas of cultural, ecological,economic, or religious significance identified incooperation with such local communities). \" For example, sacred burial grounds within a forest man-Box 3.5 The Six Types of High Conservation Value Areas HCV Resource Network Charter (2006, pp. 2-3), adapted from the FSC.areas that can be used more intensively without threatening maintenance of conservation values. For example, in theRussian Komi Republic, the HCV approach has been used to guide forest land planning exercises at the regional level, including rezoning concession areas based on public con-sultation and identification of social and biological HCVs.At the management unit level, the HCV approach can beused to guide ongoing management of natural forests. The presence or absence of each HCV is determined based on ananalysis of existing information and the collection of addi-tional information where necessary to fill gaps. The existingprotection of, and threats to, the values, and the potentialfuture threats (including those arising from the proposed activities) need to be identified to determine management prescriptions. In areas zoned for conversion to agricultural or industrial forest plantations (for example, palm oil and pulp), HCV isalso being widely used to identify areas that are low risk forconversion and those that must be maintained and managedas natural vegetation to preserve critical conservation values.It can also provide guidance on plantation planning andmanagement to optimize conservation goals (see note 3.3,Forest Plantations). For example, the main industry standardfor palm oil (the RSPO [Roundtable on Sustainable PalmOil] Principles and Criteria) 5includes a prohibition on con- version of HCV areas to oil palm plantations and a require- ment to maintain HCVs within areas affected by oil palm plantations and mills. Also, outside of forest certification, at least one pulp company in Indonesia has made public com-mitments not to convert HCV forests to pulp plantations. Ina conversion scenario, the HCV approach needs to be incor-porated into an adequate safeguards framework, notably to ensure legal compliance, protect land use and tenure rights,address consent procedures, and ensure that the concept isnot inappropriately used to justify conversion based onincomplete information. Where the HCV approach is used for forest land-use planning involving conversion, identifying which areas offorest cannot be converted to plantations is a core part ofthis process, but management recommendations for otherareas of forest are also extremely important. Finally, the HCV concept has been invoked in the for- mulation of procurement and investment policies. A grow-ing number of companies and governments are introducingpurchasing policies that preclude the purchase of wood orwood products from forest areas where HCVF are not man-aged for their values. For example, members of the WWF'sGFTN are committed to excluding material from HCVF,unless certified by the FSC. A number of investment organ-izations, particularly banks and screened pension funds, aremaking commitments to avoid investing in poorly managedHCVF. OPERATIONAL ASPECTS The HCV approach provides a systematic process for iden- tifying critical conservation values\u2014both environmentaland social\u2014within a forest tract or production unit, and for planning forest or land-use management to ensure that these values are maintained or enhanced (see examples inboxes 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8). 6HCV forest is the area of forest that needs to be managed to protect its conservation values. The HCV approach is based on a three-step process: 1. Identify the critical conservation values that are present (the HCVs), and the areas where they occur. 2. Manage the HCVs by addressing the threats to the values, both now and in the future (including the threats posed by any planned activities). 3. Monitor the HCVs to ensure that management prescrip- tions are effective in maintaining or enhancing the val-ues, and adapt the management regime to take accountof any changes. An ideal HCV process would follow the sequence illus- trated in figure 3.3. The strength of the HCV approach is that it recognizes variations in countries and situationswhere it is applied (see box 3.9). Where existing protectionis good and threats limited, the requirements will differfrom those in a similar area where existing protection ispoor and threats extensive. Although the HCV approachwas originally developed for use at the scale of forest man-agement units, it has increasingly been applied at variousscales up to the landscape level. HCV process: Implementing HCV assessment and defining management prescriptions Identification of the presence and location of HCVs. For each of the six HCVs, a systematic process is required to establish whether it is present in the area of interest and, if present, the approximate extent. A national interpretation of the HCVF toolkit, if it exists, is the first point of reference as the HCVs are defined for the national context and relevant data resources are listed. Inthe absence of a national interpretation, relevant informa- tion can be obtained from other regional interpretations.The HCVF toolkit provides generic guidance.

Global toolkit National interpretation RevisionIdentify Manage MonitorFigure 3.3 HCVF Identification and Follow-up: The Ideal Picture The WWF and IKEA Co-operation on Forest Projects selected two local forestry bureaus in northeast Chinaas pilot sites for implementing SFM techniques. HCVFs were identified and assessed in the 420,000 hectares of forests managed by these two bureaus. Thedetailed work mapped out HCVFs as areas that shouldbe set aside as nature reserves, areas where loggingshould be banned, and areas with important stands of Korean pine. It also led to these two forestry bureausachieving the first FSC certification of state-ownedforests in China. After their participation in this work,the two involved provincial governments firmlyembraced the HCVF concept. The Jilin ForestryDepartment introduced HCVF identification into itsfive-year provincial forestry development plan, and in Heilongjiang province, the HCVF concept will be inte-grated into the provincial standard for identifying forests that provide key ecological benefits. Alongside this HCVF work, the projects also led to the identifica-tion of potential HCVFs at the landscape and regionallevels within northeast China and Inner Mongolia. In2006, China's State Forestry Administration incorpo- rated the HCVF concept into the national guidelineson SFM planning. Thus, areas identified as HCVFs willbe designated priority areas for sustainable manage-ment or protection. These guidelines are to be distrib-uted to all provinces in China for implementation bylocal government or forest management units. Box 3.6 Identifying HCVFs in State Forests and Taking It to Scale: The Case of China Source: WWF 2007.process draws on sources of data that are already available (box 3.10), which may take many forms. Obtaining reliable maps is an important component of the process. The maps may include data on recent for- est cover, hydrology, elevation, and slope, but manynational mapping processes give further useful details on habitats, soil type, and current or planned land use.Existing data and maps can be combined with specifically commissioned surveys to build a picture of the location of the values.Managing the HCVs. The aim of HCV management is to ensure that the HCVFs identified are maintained or enhanced. The activities to achieve this aim can start with delineating areas that need total protection, areas requiring special management (for example, production activities thatare consistent with conservation aims, managed to anagreed standard and monitored for any negative effects), and areas that do not require specific precautions. This begins with knowing the area of forest that is required to maintain each relevant value. For example, to maintain or enhance an HCV1 area (containing a specifiedset of rare, threatened, or endemic species; see box 3.5), thearea of forest required to support viable populations of thosespecies needs to be defined. Thus, some knowledge of the biology of the species in question is required to define areasthat are critical habitats or resources for breeding and forag-ing, areas that permit movement of individuals between theseresources, or areas that protect these resources. A similarprocess needs to be applied to each HCV in turn, with equal consideration given to social, cultural, and ecological values. In addition, management of HCVs requires understand- ing the present and future threats to the values, including those posed by any planned activities. Threats may be fromproposed management activities, such as logging operationsor plantation establishment, or from external activities, suchas hunting of wildlife, encroachment for agriculture,planned conversion of land, or illegal logging. Examples ofthe type of methodologies for threat assessment that can beused in HCV management include the 5-S Framework forConservation Project Management and the ParticipatoryConservation Planning tools developed by The Nature Con-servancy. 108 CHAPTER 3: MEETING THE GROWING DEMAND FOR FOREST PRODUCTSIn support of meeting the Global Forest Target of improving the management of 300 million hectares ofproduction forests through forest certification by 2010 [http://www.worldwildlife.org/alliance/targets.cfm], WWF has developed a first draft of an HCVF toolkitfor Papua New Guinea (PNG). By facilitating the iden-tification of HCVFs, companies will be able to managethese according to FSC principles while maintaining their high conservation attributes, and pursue certifi-cation under this system. The process of developing the HCVF national toolkit brought together government, NGOs, privateindustry, and land owners to develop consensus on themeaning of HCVF in PNG. After a first draft was cir- culated to stakeholders, comments were incorporated and a final version was made available online in Febru-ary 2006 (see http://www.wwfpacific.org.fj/publications/png/HCVF_T oolkit_First_Ed.pdf).PNG's ecological diversity posed a challenge to cre- ating a national-level HCVF interpretation. At the time of preparing the technical progress report, large- scale industrial field testing had yet to be conducted, but testing had been conducted in smaller operations,and additional field trials were to be used to testwhether monsoon forests, considered \"fragile forests,\"should be excluded from logging and conversion activities altogether. Other outputs of the project included the creation of coarse-scale HCVF maps and an effort to lobby thegovernment to recognize HCVFs in provincial andnational forest plans. At the time of drafting the tech-nical progress report, it was indicated that the com- pleted PNG HCVF national toolkit was to be adopted by the PNG FSC National Standards for compliancewith the FSC's Principle 9.Box 3.7 Applying HCVF in Papua New Guinea Source: PNG FSC 2006. The government of Bulgaria formally endorsed the national HCVF toolkit and adopted it as amethodology for biodiversity inventories. The toolkit will be included in the national standards for forest management planning in Bulgaria. Thiswill ensure that more valuable forests will benefitfrom its stipulations and will be managed recog-nizing the HCVs. The toolkit is also being used by the United Nations Development Fund and anumber of NGOs in Bulgaria for their biodiver-sity-related work and by the 10 nature parks in thecountry. Source: WWF 2007.Box 3.8 Mainstreaming HCVF Work MAINSTREAMING CONSERVATION CONSIDERATIONS INTO PRODUCTIVE LANDSCAPES 109An important element of the HCV process is the national-level interpretation. Although it is possible touse the generic guidelines of the Global HCVF T oolkit, it is much more convenient for forest managers if the global HCV definitions are adapted for use in theirparticular country, region, or forest type. This step canbe done by a specific HCV working group, drawing onexisting groups working on related issues or groups working on defining or mapping forest values. Thisworking group can interpret the HCV definitions todevelop a national standard. Two types of processescan be used for creating national or regional standards: A multi-stakeholder process that is consensus based. Though more time intensive, this provides a defini-tive interpretation with wide-ranging support as the national or regional standard for HCV . A technical adaptation process involving a technical working group or team. This is often a practical way forward for projects in countries with no national standard. However, it must be made explicit that the objective is not national standard setting and thatthe outcome is not a definitive one. The objective of national interpretation is to define HCVs and establish guidelines on management for specific cases. This includes deciding the relevant forestvalues, such as forest types, species assemblages, andthe like, and specifying parameters to measure them. Italso involves, for each forest value and parameter,defining thresholds for deciding when to designate aHCV (that is, a value that is significant at the global,regional, or national level). Thresholds can includeactual locations, levels, numbers, or types. A national interpretation serves two purposes: It facilitates on-the-ground application of the HCV concept by producing HCVs that are clearlydefined, detailed, and straightforward in a manner that can be understood by nonspecialists and unambiguously assessed at forest levels. Thisensures greater consistency in the way it is used. The process itself is useful because it brings together a range of interests and stakeholders and con-tributes to the development of a shared understand- ing of the best way to protect environmental and social values.Box 3.9 National Interpretation of HCV Guidelines Source: ProForest 2003.

The outcome of this process should be a documented plan, integrated into the operational management plan, that sets out management prescriptions, taking into accounteach HCV and the relevant threat assessments. Plans devel-oped in this way for the protection of the same value in twodifferent locations may be very different depending on the levels of threat and existing protections. Monitoring the HCVs. After management plans have been defined, a monitoring program needs to be in place to provide managers with up-to-date information on theHCVs for which they bear responsibility, as a basis for man-agement intervention or ongoing adjustment of operational plans. Monitoring plans should be derived from manage-ment objectives and written into the management plan.Data gathered during the HCV assessment should be usedto determine the generic and specific objectives of the mon-itoring program. The aim should be to develop a set of sim-ple, measurable indicators for each key value. Monitoringactivities can include social and biological surveys anddirect and indirect observation of indicators, and are likelyto involve detailed data collection over the long term. There are a number of tools available to support the use of the HCV approach, all of which are available at the HCV Resource Network Web site (http://www.hcvnetwork.org): The HCV Resource Network. The network was formed by key organizations with an interest in the HCV concept to support and promote the consistent use of this concept across its range of uses.7The network's Web site provides a range of services, including general information on the HCV concept, information on HCVF projects and case studies, country-specific briefings, guidance and support material, contact details for HCV practitioners, details ofconferences and training events, and links to relevantresources. The Global HCVF Toolkit. The toolkit (ProForest 2003) provides globally applicable information, but also con- tains sections that describe the process of defining HCVs at the national level and guidance for forest managers on how to identify and manage HCVs. The toolkit has beeninterpreted for several national contexts; it is availablefrom the Web site. Good practice guidelines for HCV identification manage- ment and monitoring. Two documents (ProForest 2008a and ProForest 2008b) set out the process steps that are important to a credible HCV assessment process. TheAssessment, Management & Monitoring of High Con- servation Values: A practical guide for forest managers(ProForest 2008a) is available from www.ProForest.netand www.hcvnetwork.org. Good Practice Guidelines for High Conservation Value Assessments: A MethodologicalApproach for Practitioners and Auditors (ProForest 2008b) is available from Proforest and www.hcvnetwork.org. Good practice in HCV assessment and management T o ensure that an HCVF assessment is useful, some impor- tant elements should be considered.8 Data requirements. Appropriate use of data is at the heart of the HCV assessment process. Identifying HCVs and plan-ning appropriate management requires data to allow the assessor to know the values that are likely to be present and the potential impacts of different management scenarios.Preparation is therefore critical to ensure that the full rangeof applicable information is available. The impact and scaleof planned operations, and the likely conservation impor- tance of the assessed area, can only be properly understoodwith a solid knowledge base. These also help determine theteam and stakeholder consultation requirements. Team requirements. HCV assessments are typically car- ried out by small teams with practical conservation experi- ence. T echnical expertise (ideally, local expertise) in a rele-vant topic such as ecology, social issues, or environmentalmanagement is very important, but an HCVF assessment isalso much more likely to be carried out successfully if it isundertaken by a team with a thorough understanding of thewhole HCV process and experience in implementing it. Consultation requirements. Consultation is an essen- tial part of the HCV process. Appropriate stakeholders, including industry representatives, conservation NGOs,local government, and local community representatives, have an important role to play in ensuring a successfuloutcome, both in identifying values and determining man-agement options. Consultation serves a number of impor-tant purposes: T o gather information on the social and environmental situation in the assessment area, to contribute to theHCV identification and decision making process T o provide information on potential negative impacts ofoperations on HCVs 110 CHAPTER 3: MEETING THE GROWING DEMAND FOR FOREST PRODUCTST o identify possible approaches for avoiding, mitigating, or compensating for negati ve impacts of operations T o eliminate gaps in data, where information is held bystakeholders T o avoid or significantly reduce conflicts arising fromoperations T o ensure the transparency of the assessment process andthe credibility of the decisions made Use of the precautionary principle. Where data are lacking, it can be difficult to make management decisions. In the case of low- or medium-impact operations, if there isinsufficient information for specific management of a givenHCV , managers should aim to implement best operational practice and develop a monitoring plan that will detectchanges in the status of an HCV and allow prompt action.The higher the potential concentration of values and theimpact of the operation, the further the management planshould go toward protection and restoration. In the context of conversion, the land manager must try to reduce uncer- tainty, if necessary by commissioning surveys and field workto determine the limits and thresholds of HCVs, and securethese areas before any conversion. Stakeholder engagementis critical to a credible outcome; for example, the full rangeof stakeholders should be involved in defining what a suffi-cient area represents. Reporting and transparency. The end product of an HCVF assessment should be management recommenda- tions about forest that must be protected and forest thatmust be managed in a specific way. HCVF assessment reports should contain sufficient information for an expertthird party to be able to judge whether the identificationprocess and consultation were adequate to justify manage-ment decisions. This assessment should be done in a clearand consistent way, and include a final peer review and con-sultation process to guarantee quality control. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS Although the HCVF concept was only developed in 1999, it has already been widely used and some key issues haveemerged: Good understanding of the concept and technical competence are important for proper application.The framework is relatively sophisticated and has multipleelements, as discussed earlier in this note. It requires a goodunderstanding of the concept itself, as well as technical competence from practitioners, to be useful and to ensurethat all the different interests and values are balanced. Prediction of costs. The cost of an HCVF assessment is closely related to the number of people involved and the time required, which, in turn, depend on the size and complexityof the forest area, the number of HCVs potentially present,the types of land use proposed for the area, the availability ofdata, and the complexity of the local situation. There areexcellent examples of HCVF assessments carried out in a fewdays with a small team, or even internally by a company, andcosting relatively little. At the other end of the scale, largeassessments in complex situations, particularly involvingforest conversion, can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Sim-ilarly, national interpretation processes can be relativelystraightforward and cost only a few thousand dollars or be complex and involve significant costs. Follow-up of HCVF implementation. Active stewardship of HCVFs is necessary for implementation. In Indonesia, in response to external pressure to protect the HCVFs in itsconcessions, the pulp and paper company APP committedto protecting the HCVF found in one of its concessions. In2005, APP commissioned Smartwood to map HCVFs inthree of its other forest management units in the area. Onthe basis of this mapping, APP announced that it wouldprotect the HCVFs identified and signed an agreement withSmartwood to track how well it is managing its HCVFs overthe next five years. However, recent monitoring reportsshowed that APP failed to protect these areas from fires andillegal logging, despite its earlier pledges. This case high-lights the need for active stewardship of HCVFs if companycommitments are to make a real difference in practice(WWF 2007). A systematic framework for analysis. HCVF is not a panacea and cannot resolve every intractable land-use debate involving forests. However, it provides a systematicframework for analysis, gives consideration to a wide range of conservation values in an integrated process, and incor-porates consultation and involvement of stakeholders infinding an appropriate solution, all of which combine tomake it a very useful tool. NOTES 1. It should be noted that in most countries regulations and silvicultural guidelines include conservation aspects. NOTE 3.1: MAINSTREAMING CONSERVATION CONSIDERATIONS INTO PRODUCTIVE LANDSCAPES 111However, these general rules are seldom sufficient to guide actions in particular sites. 2. IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas, http://iucn.org/themes/wcpa/. 3. The need to increase area under protection should be defined by each country and its particular conditions because in some World Bank client countries large shares of forests are already protected while in most others more isneeded. 4.

CROSS-REFERENCED CHAPTERS AND NOTES Note 3.3: Forest Plantations 112 CHAPTER 3: MEETING THE GROWING DEMAND FOR FOREST PRODUCTSForest certification has become of increasing conse- quence to forest management and policy in recentyears, as consumers have become increasingly scrupulous about the source of their forest products. This note discusses the potential for certification not only to act asan investment safeguard and supplement traditional WorldBank project monitoring, but also to provide a range ofother benefits, such as market access and improved gover- nance and stakeholder relations. The overarching goal ofsupporting the development an d adoption of forest certifi- cation is to harness its potential while avoiding associatedrisks. This note describes how, in addition to providing aninvestment safeguard, certification can achieve less tangible benefits, such as resolving stakeholder conflict, providing forest surveillance where government capacity is inadequate,and enabling market access. This subject is interconnectedwith many of the notes within this sourcebook, includingthose on forest governance (chapter 5), illegal logging (note5.5), and small and medium enterprises (note 2.2). OVERVIEW AND CONSIDERATIONS OF INTEREST FOR WORLD BANK ACTIVITIES Reliable information on social and environmental impacts of production processes becomes increasingly important fordeveloping and maintaining business relations as markets become increasingly integrated at the global scale. Demand for such information originates from consumers, includinggovernments, who are concerned about the negative conse-quences of their purchasing decisions as well as from agrowing number of businesses that are interested in avoid- ing damage to their images, potentially triggered whenengaging in socially and environmentally harmful activities. Against this background, forest certification emerged as an instrument to provide information on forest managementperformance and thus assist consumers and businesses, pre- dominantly in the timber products sector, with their pur-chasing decisions. Certification was conceived in the early 1990s as a market-based mechanism aimed at rewardinggood management of forests with better market access andpossibly price premiums\u2014particularly to high-priced andenvironmentally sensitive markets in developed countries\u2014for products from certified forests. Since then, the area undercertified forest management increased considerably, from 30million hectares in 2002 to approximately 250 millionhectares worldwide today. The number of products bearingcertification labels and the number of different certificationsystems in the marketplace have also proliferated. OPERATIONAL ASPECTS Generally, the first step of the certification process consists of a conformity assessment in which the quality of a pro-duction process (for example, its environmental impacts, social performance, technical aspects, efficiency) or special features of products or services are assessed against require-ments specified in a standard. In the case of forest manage-ment certification, independent assessment provides ananalysis of the applied management practices in relation to the standard requirements. If successful, a certificate isissued that can be used as assurance that the operation is incompliance with the provisions set forth in the applied stan-dard. Continual conformance monitoring of the certifiedoperation is carried out through repeated surveillance visits during the validity period of the certificate. In general, cer- tificate holders are allowed to use a label and to make claimsabout their adherence to the standard requirements. In addition, most certification systems developed rules for the handling of certified timber in downstream process-ing facilities, such as saw mills, paper mills, or furniture pro-duction, that allow certified timber to be traced throughoutthe supply chain to the end consumer. Application of theserules and the subsequent certification of the implementedprocesses in the timber industry are the basis for claims on 113Forest Certification SystemsNOTE 3.2the origin of products from a certified forest. This chain-of- custody certification is therefore an indispensable tool tolink supplies from certified forests to consumer demand for certified products. It should be noted, however, that the scope of chain-of-custody certification is limited to theprocesses for control of certified and uncertified materialflows and does not include the social or environmentalquality of timber processing. 1 The World Bank introduced certification as an important element of its safeguard policy on forests (World Bank 2004), making use of the control and surveillance mecha- nisms provided by certification systems to supplement the World Bank's own monitoring efforts. Certification under asystem acceptable to the World Bank is required for enablinginvestments into commercial forest harvesting operations atan industrial scale. Alternatively, operations can adhere to a time-bound action plan accepted by the World Bank that isadequate to achieve certification under such a system withina defined time frame. The World Bank's policy more clearlydefines the forest management standards a certification sys-tem should require (paragraph 10, OP 4.36) and the neces- sary minimum thresholds for the rules governing the opera- tions of certification systems (paragraph 11, OP 4.36) forthem to be acceptable to the World Bank. Beyond this more narrowly focused perspective of certi- fication as a safeguard tool are a number of reasons to usethis instrument and related processes and institutions moreproactively, including the following: Conflict mitigation and stakeholder dialogue. Given the great potential of forests to deliver multiple products and services, interests diverge widely and conflicts over theuse of forest resources are extensive in many forest regions. If properly designed, certification systems provide mecha-nisms for the involvement of stakeholders at the nationallevel in the process of setting standards for forest manage-ment. In addition, local communities and other stakehold-ers are normally consulted during the certification auditand their concerns and opinions are considered in the certi-fication decision. In the course of such processes, the avail-able information is improved not only about forest man-agement practices but also about the varying and conflictinginterests of stakeholders. This increases transparency con-siderably and may contribute to better understandingbetween the different actors in the sector, and thus bears thepotential to mitigate conflicts. Supplementing government forest surveillance. The certification process consists of an assessment of operationsaccording to a standard that at a minimum meets, and fre- quently exceeds, a country's legal requirements for forest management. Certification could therefore be used to sup-plement or in some instances even replace governmentalsurveillance mechanisms in the sector and thus contributeto more efficient use of scarce public resources. Providing a role model. T o achieve certification under internationally acceptable standards, companies must have adequate management systems in place. In comparison with competing businesses, these companies often demonstratebetter economic performance and can serve as a benchmarkfor SFM. Market access. Maintaining or expanding access to export markets is critical to the economic viability of the forest sec- tor in many countries. Particularly for timber from devel-oping countries, market access can be hampered by con-sumer concerns about the negative impacts of forestharvesting. It is increasingly important for companies to beable to demonstrate the sustainability of their products andto be able to trace the source materials through the supplychain (chain of custody). Many certification systems canhelp provide this assurance. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS Barriers to certification In the past, a number of barriers particularly prevalent in developing countries became apparent, considerably ham-pering the development of certification schemes and their widespread application. The gap between then-current for- est management practices and the performance levelrequired by many standards resulted in high compliancecosts and deterred many companies from pursuing certifi-cation. Furthermore, the kinds of institutions required for developing and conducting the processes for reliable certifi-cation are often not available or lack the capacity to performthe complex tasks involved. Experience has also shown thatit is considerably more difficult for small-scale operations toachieve certification and access markets for certified prod- ucts because of economies of scale that substantially decrease per-unit costs of certification for bigger enter-prises. So far, only a limited number of timber processingcompanies in many developing countries have chain-of-custody certification, a situation that adds to the difficultiesfor primary producers to access certified supply chains. 114 CHAPTER 3: MEETING THE GROWING DEMAND FOR FOREST PRODUCTSThe development of acceptable certification systems should form a key element of the World Bank's forest sector projects to overcome these barriers. This activity should receive increased support, for several reasons: In the absence of acceptable certification systems, the World Bank is not in a position to support a wide rangeof commercial activities involving key players and deci- sion makers in the forest sector. This situation may con- tribute to unduly limiting the World Bank's influence tomarginal fields and negatively impact the World Bank'spotential role in improving performance in the sector.Integrating forests into sustainable economic develop- ment is an overarching goal for World Bank interven-tions and is greatly facilitated by the existence of appro-priate forest certification systems. Small-scale operations potentially risk becoming further marginalized through certification activities becauseachieving certified status has proved to be particularly difficult for landholders with small areas and for com- munity forest enterprises. Certification could thereforenegatively affect the World Bank's overall goal of povertyreduction and the declared strategy to make use of forestbenefits for the poor. More proactive World Bank sup- port to the development of appropriate systems couldhelp avoid these potentially adverse impacts of certifica-tion on the World Bank's overall goals (see also note 1.3,Indigenous Peoples and Forests, for particular issuesconcerning Indigenous Peoples). Harnessing the potential of certification for improving for-est sector performance and avoiding the risks to World Bankactivities from a lack of adequate systems requires targetedactivities to overcome the bottlenecks that are still wide-spread in many World Bank client countries. Support to certification system development The activities outlined below should be considered when providing support to the development of certification sys-tems through World Bank-financed projects. Assist standards development processes. Currently, the lack of appropriate standards presents one of the most important formal obstacles for the widespread application of forest certification. While international and nationalorganizations may be available to implement other elementsof certification (such as certification assessments), stan-dards development has to be carried out by local initiativesthat, in many countries, lack the funding, capacity, and staffto conduct the tasks involved in managing participatory processes. The World Bank's provisions for standard setting,which clearly require locally adapted forest managementstandards developed with the participation of a wide rangeof stakeholders, provides further justification for support-ing these processes. Consensus-based decision making regarding contentious issues is often a lengthy process with a number of uncer-tainties. Progress may therefore not follow strict WorldBank project deadlines or adhere to narrowly defined proj-ect targets. Furthermore, care should be taken to not undulyinfluence the process so that results not accepted by a num-ber of the involved and affected stakeholders can be avoided. Eligibility of standard-setting initiatives for poten-tial World Bank funding may best be based on the criteriadefined in OP 4.36 and on the interpretation of these provi-sions outlined in chapter 9, Applying Forest Policy OP 4.36,and chapter 11, Forest Certification Assessment Guide:Summary on Use, in section II of this sourcebook. T oday, two certification systems are operating at the international level\u2014FSC (http://www.fsc.org) and thePEFC (http://www.pefc.org). These umbrella organizationsprovide international framework standards for further elab-oration through standard-setting initiatives at the nationallevel. T o maintain flexibility and to provide a basis for certi-fication that can later be used by companies interested ineither of the international systems, standard-settingprocesses should strive to adhere to the rules and regula-tions of both the FSC and PEFC. This approach couldreduce conflicts that may arise from an early and potentiallycontentious selection of the system to which a national cer-tification system may want to adhere to. Build local certification capacity. The skills to imple- ment and manage certification systems, particularly in the field of forest management, are underdeveloped in many World Bank client countries. Although international certifi-cation systems and certifying bodies provide services inthese countries, the employment of expatriate personneladds to the high costs for certification in developing coun- tries. Establishment of local expertise for the tasks of certi-fication assessment and possibly accreditation of certifyingbodies would often reduce costs and, most of all, add to themaintenance of national ownership over certification andthus contribute to more widespread acceptance of the tool. Assist small, individual operations in pursuing cer- tification. Within its projects, the World Bank may finance investments directed at the improvement of forest NOTE 3.2: FOREST CERTIFICATION SYSTEMS 115management practices in selected enterprises. Given the decreased competitiveness that results from their structuraldisadvantages, small operations and community forestry are in special need of adequate funding. In this context, the time-bound action plan for certification foreseen in OP 4.36and further outlined as a safeguard instrument in chapter11, Forest Certification Assessment Guide: Summary onUse, can provide the conceptual basis for planning and monitoring assistance to individual companies. Capacity-building efforts should be extended to down- stream processing facilities to improve technical knowledgerelated to development and implementation of appropriatechain-of-custody systems. Again, these activities should focus on small and medium enterprises, which are impor- tant partners for smaller forest operations but in many caseslack the capacity to achieve certification of their processesfor the control of material flows. NOTE 1. The widely applied quality and environmental manage- ment systems set forth in ISO 9002 or ISO 14001 standards can provide the basis for chain-of-custody systems but, in general, require adaptation to the specific requirements of certification systems before products can be labeled as com-pliant with those systems.SELECTED READINGS Burger, D., J.

Managed properly, they may also be effective in the protection and conservation of soil andwater resources, revegetation of degraded landscapes, reha-bilitation of habitats, and for carbon sequestration. How-ever, they have also been associated with conversion of nat- ural forests, the destruction of habitat, and themarginalization of local and Indigenous Peoples. This noteexamines the potential for plantations to deliver a variety ofgoods and services and identifies the precautions necessaryto avoid causing negative environmental and social impacts. OVERVIEW AND CONSIDERATIONS OF INTEREST FOR WORLD BANK ACTIVITIES Because of their efficiency in wood production, along with increasing restrictions on the use of native forests, woodsupply from plantations has grown from 5 percent to 30 percent of the total share of industrial fiber over the past 15 years, and projections are that this will increase to 50 per-cent by 2040 (World Bank 2005). T oday, most of the world's140 million ha of plantations are established for productivepurposes, with another 31 million ha established for protec- tion (FAO 2006). Trees have an excellent capacity to capture and hold, or \"fix,\" atmospheric carbon and are now being employed forcarbon sequestration to mitigate greenhouse gas effects andclimate change. Carbon content in trees is a function of their density and volume. The faster the trees are able to grow, the more rapidly they fix carbon. The paradox is thatmany of the same exotic trees that grow rapidly and aremost useful for sequestering carbon also pose increasedrisks for local environmental impacts because of theiraggressive characteristics.OPERATIONAL ASPECTS In general, most productive plantations are characterized by uniform species composition and age-class distributionwithin stands, regular spacing between tree stems, and sim- ple geometric configurations (blocks)\u2014characteristics that enhance their utility and cost effectiveness. However, thesesame qualities, along with the use of mechanical and chem-ical treatments and occasional replacement of native vegeta-tion, have led to concerns about plantations' impacts on the environment and biodiversity. Social issues can also emergewhen large operations fail to address impacts on local pop-ulations or fail to include landowners' and other stakehold-ers' concerns in their operations. For these reasons, WorldBank-financed operations need to ensure that both envi- ronmental and social concerns are considered early in the project design. In the end, productive plantations do nothave to compromise the environment or biodiversity, orlead to social exclusion\u2014in fact, they can favorably affecteach of them, or at a minimum their impacts can be miti-gated, and it is the World Bank's job to ensure that this hap-pens within its investments. Scale of activity. World Bank operations involving plan- tations may be carried out at both national and local levels. Striking the balance between these very differentapproaches, or choosing one over the other, during projectdesign requires a solid understanding of the country's needs and goals for the sector, as well as of local conditions inareas targeted for interventions. Conversely, most countrieslack a strategic vision for forestry, and World Bank projectsmust frequently incorporate elements of strategic planningwith more tangible activities that promote sustainabledevelopment, such as research, extension, and the promo-tion of best management practices. Stakeholder processessuch as National Forestry Programs (see note 6.3, Identify-ing the Need for Analysis on Forests in Development Policy 117Forest Plantations in World Bank OperationsNOTE 3.3Reforms) provide the framework for participatory develop- ment of national strategies and, where available, projectpreparation should draw on their work. Because forestry is a long-term endeavor, a correct focus and vision for the intervention is critical at the onset\u2014it is a template for thefuture. Species selection. Productive plantations are usually established for one of two purposes, sawtimber or pulp, and to a lesser extent for NTFPs, such as rubber, or in multiple-use agroforesty and silvopastoral systems. Plantations estab-lished for pulp usually emphasize high volumes of fast-growing trees with good pulping characteristics, particularly high specific gravity and long fibers (hardwoods) or tra- cheid (softwoods). Such plantations in developing countriesare frequently established using exotic pines from the Amer-icas, eucalypts from Australia, or acacias. Trees selected forsawtimber plantations must produce wood appropriate forthe intended end use, which can be highly variable andincludes wood for structural framing and construction, fur-niture, veneers, or crates and pallets, among others. In all cases, species needs to be carefully selected to ensure that the desired end products (or services) are even-tually obtained. At the same time, market demands andtrends should be taken into account to ensure that the trees will be marketable at maturity. Planting programs that failto take market factors into account can, and have, resultedin large areas of plantations with limited or negligible finan-cial viability and consequent loss of investors in the sector.For many countries, this poses a paradox because they areunable to attract or develop wood industries until an ade-quate resource base is developed or assured. In such cases,planting programs with productive aims should carefullyanalyze projections of needs at local, national, and interna-tional levels during formulation to ensure their programgets off to the right start. Management practice. Plantation productivity is nor- mally much greater than that of natural forests. Well- managed plantations in some developing countries haveannual growth rates in excess of 40 m 3/ha. The most pro- ductive native forests (those of the southeastern United States) show internal rates of return (IRRs) of around 4-8 percent, whereas, P. taeda plantations in Brazil have achieved IRRs of 17 percent, and plantations of Eucalyptus grandis in Brazil have recorded IRRs of 24 percent (Cubbage et al., 2007). The large differences in returns between plantationsand natural forests are attributable to the application of management practices, the selection of the best species forproduction, optimal stocking, and lower land and labor val- ues in developing countries. Industrial plantations also ben-efit from site preparation techniques, the use of improvedseeds, pest management, and higher levels of stocking overnatural forests. Natural forests may not need these initialinvestments. If natural forests are managed as going con-cerns, they can be and often are economically viable. Use of native species. Because many species of trees grow much faster outside their native ranges, they provide improved opportunities for increased financial returns. Thishas given rise to an extensive use of eucalypts (from Aus-tralia) and southern yellow pines and Monterrey pine (fromthe United States) in industrial plantations and develop-ment programs. In the developing world, about 44 millionha of plantations are found in Asia, the bulk of which are located in China; 11 million in South America, mostly inArgentina, Brazil, and Chile; and another 10 million inAfrica, in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Rwanda, and others.Smaller areas of exotic plantations are common throughoutthe rest of the developing world. While the use of exotics ispopular from an economic perspective, concerns abouttheir environmental impacts have been growing. A recentCIFOR study concluded that there are situations whereplantations have affected critical habitats, but it also con-cluded that such claims may be exaggerated (World Bank2003; Cossalter and Pye-Smith 2003). Still, the widespreaduse of exotics has led to an increasingly polarized debateconcerning their use and potential impact on the environ-ment. For World Bank projects, this means potential repu-tational risks, and the need for good public outreach andconsensus building during project preparation and imple-mentation, as well as safeguards monitoring. While World Bank-financed projects should endeavor to use native species whenever possible, in reality, client coun- tries and producers are more likely to favor the use ofexotics over native species because financial returns oninvestments are frequently much higher. In such cases, find-ing a middle ground and ensuring that any impacts from the use of exotics is mitigated or avoided is essential. T oachieve this, specific measures must usually be employed tointegrate biodiversity conservation into exotic plantations.Examples of such techniques include maintaining biological corridors and integrating native species into plantations;establishing set asides for wildlife and biodiversity conserva-tion; favoring smaller patches of plantations rather thanlarge contiguous blocks of monocultures; avoiding invasive exotics; and generally following standard best managementpractices, which emphasize the control of nonpoint pollu- 118 CHAPTER 3: MEETING THE GROWING DEMAND FOR FOREST PRODUCTStion from silvicultural activities, including site preparation, road building, and harvesting (Davis 2005). Research pro-grams to promote knowledge building for the use and man- agement of native species can also be helpful. With these tools at the disposal of the project team, World Bank opera-tions stand to do a much better job of guaranteeing envi-ronmental sustainability than could be done under currentindustry standards, thereby ensuring that new programs get off to the right start. Community involvement in plantations. Planting trees to establish woodlots and agroforestry or other multiple-use systems can be important elements of community and localdevelopment. So can plantations for wood production, par-ticularly those using short rotation systems. Such effortsgenerally focus on overcoming local population needs forbuilding materials and fuelwood, increasing incomes (forexample, through the sale of timber), and encouraging envi-ronmental sustainability of land holdings. The principles ofworking at the local level are similar to those outlined forlarger-scale operations in technical terms\u2014species and siteselection; market, cost, and needs analyses; capacity build-ing; and management practices. At the same time, becausethe rural poor are often challenged with day-to-day sur-vival, it is critical that risks to their livelihoods are mitigated. Programs should be designed from the bottom up, andimplemented in full cooperation and consensus with partic-ipants, in consideration of their particular situations. Fre-quently this means employing social foresters or otherdevelopment specialists who work closely with the commu-nities involved in a project (see also note 1.3, IndigenousPeoples and Forests, and chapter 12, Applying OP 4.10 onIndigenous Peoples, for particular risks and issues concern-ing Indigenous Peoples). Pests and fires pose common threats to plantations; pro- visions for fire breaks and training and equipping fire crewsin fire suppression can be important elements of WorldBank-financed projects. Monoculture plantations, whethernative or exotic, pose increased risks to investments becausethey may be more susceptible to pests and disease. Massiveloss and near eradication of some tree species has occurredin the last 100 years. For example, one of the most impor-tant production trees in North America, the AmericanChestnut ( Castanea dentata ), was virtually eliminated in a matter of a few years by an introduced fungus, Cryphonec- tria parasitica. Thousands of hectares of exotic P. radiata plantations were infected and succumbed to infections ofDothystroma pini in the 1980s and Cedrela odorata, even in its native range, suffers from infections from Hypsiphylagrandella when planted in monocultures. Despite the les- sons learned from such experiences, monocultures are eas- ier and more cost effective than mixed plantations\u2014that is, until problems occur, causing devastating loss. Establishment costs and technical capacity. Two essential factors must be taken into consideration in the development of a plantation project\u2014establishment costs, and the technical capacity required for planting and standmanagement. Initial investment capital for plantation estab-lishment generally comes from three sources\u2014land owners,loans, and government subsidies. With average establish-ment costs ranging from US$500 to US$2,000 per hectare, most small- and medium-scale producers are not able to finance their own plantations, nor do they have sufficientaccess to credit to guarantee loans. Large areas of plantations may be required to guarantee sufficient raw material for major forest industries. Forexample, a large pulp mill with a capacity of 1 million tonsper year will typically require a resource base of100,000-200,000 ha of plantations to sustain its productionover time (depending on growth rates and pulping charac-teristics of trees). In contrast, the resource base for sawtim-ber plantations rarely exceeds 20,000 ha, and could be sub-stantially less for smaller operations. Subsidies can play an important role in stimulating planting to encourage the development of an adequate resource base for industry (see note 5.4, Strengthening Fis-cal Systems in the Forest Sector). T o foster social inclusionwithin the sector, some World Bank projects either directlysubsidize plantations through grants (usually for smallfarmers) or work with the government in the design andexecution of subsidy programs for a wider range of produc-ers. In theory, once the cycle of planting and harvesting hasbeen completed, subsidies should be reduced or removedbecause producers will have the means to reforest withincome derived from timber sales\u2014and the economicincentive to do so. While subsidies can sometimes be useful to mainstream small producers into the sector, and help to expand theresource base necessary to promote economic growth forother producers, they have to be approached with caution.Poorly designed or implemented subsidy programs canresult in unintended environmental impacts when produc-ers plant trees in environmentally sensitive areas, or causehabitat destruction and deforestation, as can happen whenfarmers convert native forests to plantations. They may alsoencourage planting without sufficient attention to end usesand markets. The management of subsidies also poses chal- NOTE 3.3: FOREST PLANTATIONS IN WORLD BANK OPERATIONS 119lenges to weak institutions, which may provide opportuni- ties for corruption\u2014for example, when planting subsidiesare paid without sufficient field verification. Each case and country situation has to be reviewed carefully when enter- ing into discussions on subsidies and considering theirinclusion in the project design. Outgrower schemes can also encourage plantation devel- opment. This approach involves mill owners providing sub- sidies and technical assistance to local land owners to ensurethe availability of growing stock for the mill owners' pro-duction lines. In general, the World Bank would have a lim-ited role in such cases because of the private-sector natureof these schemes, except in cases of IFC involvement. Still, Bank staff should be aware of the option and possibilities to interact with such schemes within the context of their proj-ect planning and implementation. Carbon financing can provide about US$4 per ton of carbon sequestered. This is generally paid out in incrementsover an extended period, such as 20 years. However, fundingavailable from carbon, may in some cases only be sufficientto pay a portion of the plantation establishment costs and,over the lifetime of the project, usually comprises onlyabout 15-25 percent of the total costs of management. Con-sequently, carbon finance projects are building productiveactivities, including timber sales, into their projects. Thus, carbon financing can provide important subsidies for stim-ulating plantation development and carbon sequestration,but they are not viable economic endeavors in themselves.Despite these drawbacks, World Bank carbon projects areproducing valuable lessons for future efforts, which maybecome vital as the climate continues to change and globalwarming continues. Technical know-how. T echnical know-how is essential in plantation development\u2014for site and species selection, plantation establishment, and carrying out managementand harvesting activities. T echnology transfer frequentlyinvolves the need for extension programs and training ofagents to ensure that the required knowledge is transferredto producers and land owners. Existing extension programsmay be strengthened through a World Bank intervention.However, client governments have been increasingly reluc-tant to finance the start up of new forestry extension pro-grams through loan financing, World Bank projects mayencounter problems with sustainability of such programs atclosure, and government extension services can easilybecome encumbered by weak institutions. One alternative to government-funded extension pro- grams is to help countries establish private-sector extensionservices (see chapter 2, Engaging the Private Sector in For- est Sector Development, and associated notes). For example,Chile, which lacks a government extension service, has a booming forest industry, and exports US$2.3 billion in for- est products annually. Here, a strong private sector devel-oped, encouraged by a hands-off approach from the gov-ernment and a supportive institutional system that enabledit to react quickly to market demand and to access the latest technologies. Numerous independent organizations alsoprovide well-targeted advice and support to the sector. Theresult of this combination is an efficient, modern forestrysector that produces low-cost, high-quality timber productsand is competitive in world markets. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS Planted forests allow intensive production of industrial wood at a reasonable cost, which is important in countrieswith high population densities. Planted forests also offer economic opportunities for countries with natural compet- itive advantages and lands available for planting, such asArgentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Indonesia, Mexico, SouthAfrica, Uruguay, and Vietnam. In countries and zones where public land ownership is dominant, it is important to place plantation development within the framework of a transparent, accountable, andconsultative land-use plan that specifies the extent of thepermanent forest estate and locates land available forplanted forests. Good governance and an enabling policy environment are necessary to ensure private investment in plantation development, which can be initially motivated bythe World Bank's initial support. T o make plantation forestry economically viable, techni- cal management standards frequently need to be raised. Ashappened in Chile and Brazil, the adoption of new innova-tive technologies relying on high-performance species,high-quality seedlings, and efficient planting practices cansubstantially improve productivity and economic prof-itability. Also, production technologies that depend on nat-ural regeneration can offer cost-effective ways to conductproduction forestry or to rehabilitate degraded lands. Fur- thermore, it has been observed (for example, in India andVietnam) that plantations linked to industry tend to havehigher levels of productivity. Site and species matching must receive due attention to avoid adverse environmental and social impacts. In addi-tion, because policy and market failures can create moreformidable obstacles to viability than technical considera- 120 CHAPTER 3: MEETING THE GROWING DEMAND FOR FOREST PRODUCTStions, projects must be solidly based on sound policy and market organizational analyses. In particular, security ofland tenure is key in fostering investments in plantation forestry. In smallholder forestry, extension programs need to introduce improved technologies compatible with the maintenance of environmental and social values in planta-tion areas. These programs should be considered long-term undertakings and should not be limited to the plantationestablishment phase. Effective linkages between silviculturalresearch and extension institutions are critical to successfultechnology transfer. RECOMMENDED READING Planted Forest Code. http://www.fao.org/forestry.

A landscape is often defined as a geographical construct that includes not only biophysical features of an area but also its cultural and institutionalattributes (adapted from Farina [2006]). A landscape is notnecessarily defined by its size; rather, it is defined by aninteracting mosaic of land cover and land-use types relevant to the processes or services being considered or managed.Examples of forest landscapes can range from large tracts offorests used for multiple purposes (production; cultural,recreational, or environmental services; and the like) tomosaics of forests, home gardens, rice terraces, and villages that enable people to exploit mountain slopes in several countries in southeast Asia in ways that yield a diversity ofcrops, maintain soil fertility and watershed functions, andretain indigenous biodiversity. Another definition of landscape is a dynamic, complex patchwork of overlapping political, economic, social, andecological systems (Scoones 1999; Zimmerer 2000). Thelandscape is a heterogeneous area within which there canbe a mosaic of land uses that are individually relativelyhomogeneous. Recently the \"landscape approach\" has been incorpo- rated in the conceptualization of geographical spaces of interest when defining a landscape. 1A landscape approach is applied to a geographical space of interest. A landscape approach is a conceptual framework that allows for a struc- tured way of viewing the broader impacts and implicationsof any major investment or intervention in the rural sector2 (see box 4.1). It describes interventions at spatial scales that attempt to optimize the spatial relations and interactionsamong a range of land cover types, institutions, and human activities in an area of interest. Forest landscape restoration, landscape planning, and ecoagriculture all build on landscape approaches and prin- ciples. Common among these landscape approaches is thatthey aim to restore a balance of environmental, social, and economic benefits from forests and trees within abroader pattern of land use; use a landscape-level view, whether for site restoration orfor activities involving a mosaic of land uses (accord-ingly, site-level activities accommodate, or are nested in, landscape-level objectives); consider people as central elements of the landscape; and recognize that the dynamic nature of ecosystems and socioeconomic systems makes gathering completeinformation regarding any system unachievable (accordingly, explicit efforts are made to integrate and adapt plans, programs, and projects that are active in alandscape, including the sharing of new knowledge andinformation). The World Bank's Forests Strategy aims to make the most of the multiple uses and values of forests. Forests are part of a diverse livelihood portfolio for a large number of rural 123Optimizing Forest Functions in a LandscapeCHAPTER 4poor. In addition, the productive use of forests can signifi- cantly contribute to economic development, while the man-agement of biological and ecological services from forests can provide numerous local as well as global environmental benefits. As noted in the strategy, forests (and their usersand beneficiaries) both have an impact on and are affectedby policies and actions in other sectors, as well as by bio-physical changes in adjoining or biologically linked areas (as examples, forest fires can result from land-use practices inagricultural lands, or macroeconomic reforms can affect theopportunity cost of land) (see chapter 6: MainstreamingForests into Development Policy and Planning). In this con-text, optimizing forest functions 3in a landscape can unlock the full potential of forests. A landscape-focused program can facilitate the assess- ment of broader, wide-ranging trends, influences, and man- agement impacts to more adequately assess economic andecological sustainability and identify the appropriate man-agement strategies to maintain these resources for the ben-efit of all. In certain World Bank client countries where land conversion is a major threat to forests, a landscape approachcan minimize site-specific activities negatively affecting orconflicting with each other. It can also enhance any syner-gies that otherwise may be overlooked. Similarly, in clientcountries where landscapes are a mosaic of land uses, an approach that takes the landscape into account can assist ininternalizing positive externalities and minimizing negative externalities from individual land uses. While the global rate of deforestation has fallen from 0.22 percent in the 1990s to 0.18 percent in the 2000s, thedevelopment and conservation communities continue tobemoan the imminent loss of forests, biodiversity, and asso- ciated economic and environmental services. However, notall deforestation is inevitable and not all deforestation isnecessarily bad because many countries are replanting nativeand/or exotic forests on former forest lands and in naturalgrasslands. These new forests are having landscape-, regional-, and global-level impacts although they do notprovide significant biodiversity conservation and are not asubstitute for natural forests. The landscape approach canaid in better understanding the tradeoffs and potential syn- ergies among competing land claims and uses in forestzones. Thus, a balance would be attempted among pressuresto increase protected areas; expand the area of independ-ently certified and sustainably managed natural forest; and convert forests to sustainable agroforestry-based farmingsystems, timber plantations, commercial-scale agribusinessestates (such as soybean farming or cattle ranching), orcrop-based biofuels manufactured from sugar or oil palm. All of the multilateral environmental agreements now seek to achieve their objectives through the integrated man-agement of natural resource systems at large spatial scales. 124 CHAPTER 4: OPTIMIZING FOREST FUNCTIONS IN A LANDSCAPEThe landscape approach should incorporate the fol- lowing elements: Builds understanding and a shared vision of desir-able future landscapes Determines the factors that will shape the landscape inthe future so that they can be mitigated or influenced Builds multidisciplinary teams to tackle these com-plex, intersectoral landscape-scale problems Explores possible future scenarios for the geograph-ical areas in question and their peoples Provides a framework for negotiations betweenstakeholders who have different views of desirablelandscape-scale outcomes Makes the knowledge, assumptions, and desires ofdifferent stakeholders more apparent and easilyunderstood by other stakeholdersIdentifies key leverage points that can be used to getthe ecosystem or landscape to change in desirableways Establishes a flexible monitoring and evaluation sys-tem to monitor and measure impacts on the landscapeto allow for changes to be made in implementation Several approaches exist for implementing strate- gies that integrate management of land, water, and liv- ing resources and promote conservation and sustain-able use in an equitable manner (for example, an ecosystem approach). The elements listed above aregeneric to several of these approaches and providepractical operational entry points.Box 4.1 What Is a Landscape Approach? Source: Authors' compilation using Sayers 2006.People and human societies are seen as being part of these systems. The words \"landscape\" and \"ecosystem\" are widelyused in these agreements and in the general environmental policy discourse to convey the concept of integrated man- agement of resources and human activities at the landscapescale. The World Bank's clients will or should be movingtoward landscape and ecosystem approaches, and Banklending should be designed in ways that encourage and nur- ture this process and facilitate the move in this direction. This chapter (and associated notes) presents some of the key issues underlying implementation of the landscapeapproach and tools to assist with its application. PAST ACTIVITIES The study by Sayer and Maginnis (2005) showed that much contemporary forest management already uses many ele-ments of the landscape or ecosystem approaches even though it may not be using those terms. 4The World Bank has been involved in a number of watershed management projects, as well as sector projects with watershed manage- ment components. Boerma (2000) provides a review of the Bank's portfolio in this field between 1990 and 1999. According to a review of the World Bank's activities based on project appraisal documents, 24 watershed managementprojects and 29 projects with watershed management com- ponents were reported on in the period 1990-2004. Theproject rationale and objectives for more than 80 percent ofthe watershed management projects were based on sustain-able management of natural resources as a basis for agricul-tural production increase, which would lead to poverty reduction by increasing incomes. Simultaneously, institu- tional development and capacity building were addressed bymore than 90 percent of the projects. In many projects, for-est management was part of the spatial watershed manage-ment approach, with the twin objectives of maintaining orincreasing forest cover and creating incentives for sustainablemanagement by local people. 5Investments were in both nat- ural forest management and reforestation and afforestation. KEY ISSUES There is no single \"landscape approach.\" There are, however, a number of underlying concepts that deserve to be morewidely known and a number of useful techniques for devel- oping a shared understanding of landscape-scale functions, for exploring landscape-scale scenarios, and for measuringlandscape-scale outcomes (see note 4.2, Assessing Outcomesof Landscape Interventions). Thus, within the same geo-graphical area, the landscape approach would be applied differently for interventions concerned with the preserva-tion of rare plants and animals, the management of hydro-logical functions, the optimization of infrastructure invest-ments, or the maintenance of scenic beauty. Not only wouldthe area of interest be different for these different interven-tions, the methods used to address landscape issues wouldalso be different. Define the landscape. The essential first step for most natural resource managers is to define the landscape so that (i) landscape patterns and management responses can beassessed and management adjusted according to anticipatedtradeoffs and synergies, (ii) relevant institutional playerscan be identified and involved, and (iii) the approach can besuitably adapted. Linked to defining the landscape is explic-itly delineating the boundaries of the landscape beforeundertaking activities at the landscape level. Boundaries need to be established through a clear definition of the pur-pose of operating at the landscape level, and should beagreed on by all main actors. T o implement the landscapeapproach, it is useful to also spatially demarcate micro areas,or specific areas within the larger landscape. These unitsshould be tractable, improve the understanding of interac-tions among different land uses, and assist in optimizingforest functions in the landscape. The objectives for thesemacro and micro areas should be harmonized and nested tothe extent possible. Move beyond spatial planning and establishing cor- ridors. The rhetoric supporting large-scale approaches to forest conservation and management (including planta-tions) is ubiquitous in project and program descriptions.However, most systematic conservation planningapproaches appear to be based mainly on spatial planningtechniques. These approaches range from those that attempt to maximize the extent and connectivity of naturalhabitat and confine measures to improve local livelihoods tothe residual land, to those that are highly technical andframed by mathematical optimization modeling that findsthe landscape configuration that achieves specific environ- mental goals at minimum cost (see box 4.2). The premiseunderlying this chapter is that the planning associated withlandscape approaches must incorporate the management oflandscapes to provide flows of conservation and develop- ment benefits to stakeholders (see note 4.1, Integrated For-est Landscape Land-Use Planning). There can be a need tostimulate demand for such planning and to ensure that theplanning process responds to community needs. CHAPTER 4: OPTIMIZING FOREST FUNCTIONS IN A LANDSCAPE 125Take into consideration the dynamic nature of eco- logical processes and livelihood strategies. The time lag between when an action is undertaken and when its impact on the forest resource and its users is manifested must be recognized. A temporally explicit framework is required toaccommodate these important considerations. Recognize that economic forces are not set up for landscape considerations. Economic forces have a pro- found impact on both the long-term and short-term behaviorof forest stakeholders and ultimately determine the balancebetween competing management objectives (see box 4.3). Suchfactors as location, accessibility, vegetation type, and manage- ment determine the value of forests for timber production ver- sus environmental services. The adoption of ecosystemapproaches currently provides limited financial rewards. Innovative payments for environmental services (see note 2.3, Innovative Marketing Arrangements: Payments for Environmental Services) and other compensation arrange-ments can provide economic incentives for a more land-scape-based approach to optimizing forest functions. Work across political and agency boundaries. A landscape of interest often crosses multiple political (local or national) and agency boundaries, with government andcommunity capacity and presence varying widely. Becauselegal governance authority is seldom available at the land-scape level, consensus must be achieved among all relevantstakeholders and government agencies for implementationof natural resource and forest management plans on thelandscape. Collaboration among these entities may be weakand might need to be strengthened to cost effectively sup-plement and complement landscape efforts. This canrequire convening and facilitating interaction among rele-vant stakeholder groups, working closely with these groupsover time, and clarifying, or in some cases providing, theincentives for each of them to accept restrictions on the useof resources that would otherwise be unregulated. 126 CHAPTER 4: OPTIMIZING FOREST FUNCTIONS IN A LANDSCAPEIn the Tri National de la Sangha area of the Congo Basin, a World Wildlife Fund (WWF) initiativefocused on determining the sort of landscape con- figuration that would be optimal for achieving two contrasting objectives\u2014improving livelihoodsand conserving biodiversity. The project used sim-ulation models to determine the relative utility ofdifferent mixes of protected areas, logging conces- sions, and community lands. Models were devel-oped in a participatory manner so that the modelprovided a framework for discussion and negotia-tion. Economic benefits to different stakeholdergroups and employment created by different typesof land management were quantified. Similarly, the costs of protection and the benefits from hunt- ing safaris, bushmeat harvesters, and taxes paid tothe government and local communities from thesedifferent activities were calculated. Modeling exercises can result in counterintu- itive conclusions. In this case, modeling showedthat if the proportion of land under well-managedconcessions increased, the funds allocated to con-servation could be used to increase the intensity ofconservation efforts in national parks. Overall bio-diversity outcome in landscapes with high propor-tions of well-managed concessions might there-fore be better than in landscapes with a high proportion of totally protected area. Source: Sayer and others 2005.Box 4.2 Moving Beyond Optimization Models in Tri National de la SanghaThe conservation project for sustainable develop- ment in Central America, implemented during the1990s by CATIE (Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center, Costa Rica) and sev- eral local partners, demonstrated the feasibility ofapplying sustainable forest management to forestareas under 50 ha as an integrated component ofdiversified farming systems based on agriculture or livestock production. Communities in the MayaBiosphere Reserve in El Pet\u00e9n, Guatemala, couldact as forest conservation agents but for them to doso required more sustainable and profitable agri-cultural systems and guaranteed legal access to for-est resources. The project pioneered community forest concessions and was reinforced by subse- quent initiatives. The community groups obtainedlegal access to forests by means of concessions thatallowed them to protect and use the resource. Inthe process, the communities improved their orga-nizational and management capacities, their silvi-cultural ability, and their environmental awareness. Source: Campos Arce, Villalobos, and Louman 2005.Box 4.3 Incentives for Sustainable Forest Management in Fragmented Forest LandscapeEncourage stakeholder participation. By transcending political boundaries, landscapes encompass diverse users, managers, and decision makers. Stakeholder participation in the landscape approach is important to plan effectively across the landscape; understand landscape trends; integratenational, regional, and local perspectives in zoning deci-sions; promote the implementation of landscape activities;seek adoption of plans; and, finally, lay the groundwork for building in-country resource-management capacity. Ensure research and management work in concert. Not all the desired data on the landscape and its resourceswill be available in sufficient detail. This is the case aroundthe world, independent of financial and human resourcesavailable to the management authority. Managementactions for landscape activities should be designed usingexisting data but within a learning context such that futuremanagement direction can be improved over time andupdated as new information becomes available. It is benefi-cial to invest in prioritizing information and tracking thesevariables. Building an information base of these criticalvariables over time will facilitate addressing specific issuesand questions that arise. Use an iterative approach to monitor impacts and update the process. The approach adopted at the land- scape level needs to be flexible and able to accommodatenew information and changing contexts. This can requirethe use of approaches, such as adaptive management (seenote 4.3, Using Adaptive Management to Improve ProjectImplementation), that link research and management.Management plans should be considered living documents,able to evolve with changing information, environmentalconditions, and monitoring results. Conventionally system-atic plan revisions happen on a periodic basis, usually afterthe current plan has been in effect for 5-10 years. During aplan revision, the entire plan is revisited, allowing for majorrevisions and changes to its content and objectives. Adaptivemanagement, conversely, allows individual components ofthe plan to be amended or altered at any time because ofchanging resource conditions, social values, improved data,or in response to monitoring. As part of the overall process, identifying suitable indica- tors and monitoring these interactions (using technologicaladvances that facilitate continuous and periodic data collec-tion) will help to fill data gaps during the course of the ini-tiative. These data will need to be processed and presentedin a manner accessible to stakeholders for updating theplanning and implementation processes and for providing abetter understanding of interactions among the various land uses and their impacts (see note 4.2, Assessing Out-comes of Landscape Interventions). Devolve management to the appropriate levels. A key principle of the landscape approach for forests is that man- agement must be devolved to the appropriate level. Decen-tralization of decision making and support from national agencies and institutions is also important for a landscapeapproach. Devolution of management and decentralizationof decision making, however, require ensuring accountabil-ity is built into the system and that the system complementsthe local context and, where possible, is based on existing and effective institutional arrangements and structures. In landscapes where local institutions are characterized by elite capture, discrimination, or marginalization of vul- nerable groups, the institutional arrangement adopted inthe landscape approach must challenge these constraintsand create a more equitable and participatory system, asdescribed in box 4.4. New institutional arrangements,however, can also create new societal problems that mayactually lead to further degradation of natural resources.Social cohesiveness and cultural norms are critical to fos-tering participatory approaches and must be understoodbefore making assumptions about existing institutional arrangements. Strengthen local and government capacity to oper- ate at a landscape level. Working within a landscape approach requires skills in facilitation, conflict managementand mediation, consensus development, linking qualitativeand quantitative information, listening, synthesizing, andadapting ideas. This skill set is neither readily available noreasily acquired at conventional technical training programs.These skills also are not readily found in communities thatare hierarchical or have traditionally suppressed the voice ofminorities. Building government and community capacity to engage in a landscape approach will be important to make theprocess effective, with long-term impacts. Developing thenecessary capacity requires both broadening the skill set anddeveloping an innovative and feasible method for imple-menting the landscape-scale approach. Develop necessary methods and management sys- tems. Adaptive and flexible management systems are cru- cial to the effective implementation of the landscapeapproach. Existing methods must be adapted, or new onesdeveloped, to, among other things CHAPTER 4: OPTIMIZING FOREST FUNCTIONS IN A LANDSCAPE 127incorporate spatial analysis to link objectives at differing scales into planning and decision making; integrate planning and management across site, land-scape, region, and (perhaps) continental levels; predict responses of ecosystems to management activities; examine relationships and interdependencies of manage-ment actions taken on one spatial, temporal, and biolog-ical scale upon actions at another scale; and assess tradeoffs among multiple objectives and goals forthe landscape (see box 4.5). Sustainability of landscape approaches. Projects building on a landscape approach can draw significant les- sons from several generations of watershed projects. Animportant issue is that high subsidies and other induce-ments should not be used to lower the real costs of partici- pation for communities, distorting the true nature ofdemand. In many instances, this is a result of a mistakenassumption that what might be socially optimal for overallenvironmental improvements to a community will be pri-vately optimal to the resource user. Such subsidization masks the sustainability of these initiatives (Boerma 2000). FUTURE PRIORITIES AND SCALING-UP ACTIVITIES Several successful projects in watershed management encompass the basics of a landscape approach. Successes ina few pilot microcatchment areas can generate demand forappropriately scaling up the model. Incentives, constraints, and lessons learned will have to be documented, and processes streamlined, to facilitate such scaling up. 6 Facilitate the application of landscape approaches in different contexts. Landscape approaches to optimiz- ing forest functions have boundless potential. Identifying effective applications of a landscape approach can benefit from a typology that distinguishes three forest landscapes:(i) forests beyond the forest-agriculture frontier, 7(ii) fron- tier and disputed forest areas,8and (iii) forest-agriculture mosaics. In forests beyond the frontier, a landscape focus can help maintain large-scale environmental processes. For forests at the frontier, it is important to maintain landscape connectivity and to avoid irreversible degradation and neg-ative externalities. In mosaic landscapes, a landscape focuscan facilitate managing the forest for production, environ-mental services, and biodiversity. Analyze the policy context and enabling condi- tions. It is often stated that lack of ideal political and pol- icy contexts should not constrain the use of a landscapeapproach. At the same time, improved government andcommunity capacity and willingness to engage in a land-scape approach and an enabling context would facilitateimplementation of such approaches. Currently, additionalanalytical work would help to enable the policy context andinstitutional conditions necessary for implementing land-scape approaches. 128 CHAPTER 4: OPTIMIZING FOREST FUNCTIONS IN A LANDSCAPEThe Turkey Eastern Anatolia Watershed Rehabilitation Project aimed to \"help to restore sustainable range, for-est and farming activities in the upper watersheds of the three project provinces, reducing soil degradation, erosion and sedimentation in reservoirs as well asincreasing productivity and incomes in this impover-ished region of Turkey\" (World Bank 2004: 1). Theproject exceeded its target on forestlands and the insti- tutional sustainability of the project was substantial;however, the extent to which local institutions reallychanged is less evident. A review of the project stated that the project could have \"challenged the system\" more in the areas ofwomen's and poorer households' involvement. As partof the effort to improve community involvement, the project used the existing system with the village muktar as the leader. While elected by the village and supported by elected (unpaid) elders, the muktar is paid a salary as a government servant. There are, therefore, inevitable loyalty tensions. He (it is invariably a man, althoughthere have been a few women muktars ) is very much a local politician. Many vote for him because he seems the most likely to pull in public funds. Indeed, in severalcommunity meetings with the mission, it was clear thatgovernment funding support, whether through a WorldBank project or from other sources, was seen by ruralhouseholds as a right and the muktar was expected to deliver on such entitled central support.Box 4.4 Importance of Challenging Existing Institutional Arrangements that Discriminate Against Vulnerable Groups Source: World Bank 2004.CHAPTER 4: OPTIMIZING FOREST FUNCTIONS IN A LANDSCAPE 129Successful employment of initiatives at the landscape level requires a clear understanding and identificationof potential tradeoffs and opportunities for synergies. An improved understanding should lead to reduced power differentials among stakeholders, increasedequity in outcomes, and minimization of losses sufferedby specific stakeholder groups. Developing and adopt-ing a suitable framework for identifying and assessing the various ecological, economic, and social tradeoffswould facilitate such understanding and decision mak-ing regarding which tradeoffs are acceptable. ASB-Partnership for the Tropical Forest Margins (ASB) is a global partnership of research institutes,nongovernmental organizations, universities, commu- nity organizations, farmers' groups, and other local, national, and international organizations. ASB worksat the nexus of two important problems: tropicaldeforestation and human poverty. ASB focuses onlandscape mosaics (comprising both forests and agri-culture) where global environmental problems andpoverty coincide at the margins of remaining tropicalforests. ASB applies an integrated natural resourcemanagement approach to analysis and action throughlong-term engagement with local communities andpolicy makers at various levels. In the ASB matrix, natural forest and the land-use systems that replace it are scored against different cri- teria reflecting the objectives of different interestgroups. T o enable results to be compared across loca- tions, the systems specific to each are grouped accord-ing to broad categories, ranging from agroforests to grasslands and pastures. The criteria may be fine-tuned for specific locations, but the matrix always comprisesindicators for the following: two major global environmental concerns: carbon storage and biodiversity agronomic sustainability, assessed according to arange of soil characteristics, including trends innutrients and organic matter over time policy objectives: economic growth and employ-ment opportunities smallholders' concerns: their workloads, returns totheir labor, food security for their families, andstart-up costs of new systems or techniques policy and institutional barriers to adoption bysmallholders, including the availability of credit,markets, and improved technology Below is an illustrative example of an ASB Summary Matrix for the Forest Margins of Sumatra. This matrix provides information on benefits at different scales(based on rigorous analytical work). The matrix allows researchers, policy makers, environmentalists, and oth-ers to identify and discuss tradeoffs among the variousobjectives of different interest groups.Box 4.5 Tradeoffs Framework Used in the Alternatives to Slash-and-Burn Initiative Source: Alternatives to Slash-and-Burn, Policy Brief 05, http://www.asb.cgiar.org/PDFwebdocs/PolicyBrief5.pdf.ASB Summary Matrix: Forest Margins of Sumatra Adoptability Global Agronomic National policymakers' by Land-use environment sustainability concerns smallholders Production Plot-level Potential incentives Carbon production profitability (at (at private sequestration Biodiversity sustainability social prices) Employment prices) Aboveground, Aboveground, Overall Returns Average Returns time-averaged plant species/ rating to land labor input to labor Description (tons/ha) standard plot (US$/ha) (days/ha/yr) (US$/day) Natural forest 306 120 1 0 0 0 Community-based forest management 136 100 1 11 0.2 4.77 Commercial logging 93 90 0.5 1080 31 0.78Rubber agroforest 89 90 0.5 506 111 2.86Oil palm monoculture 54 25 0.5 1653 108 4.74Upland rice/bush tallow rotation 7 45 0.5 (117) 25 1.23Continuous cassava degrading to imperata 2 15 0 28 98 1.78Build government and community capacity to adopt a landscape approach and implement adaptive man-agement.

The principles underlying a landscape approach are similar to those associated with an ecosystem approach. It recognizes that humans, with their cultural diversity, are an integral component of ecosystems. It is based on 12 princi- ples endorsed by the Parties to the Convention on Biologi-cal Diversity (UNEP/CBD/COP/5/23 (see http://www.iucn.org/themes/CEM/documents/ecosapproach/cbd_ecosystem_approach_engl.pdf). 2. Many \"production landscapes\" link rural, urban, and coastal domains. 3. Forest functions are processes performed by a forest ecosystem, including photosynthesis, nutrient cycling, pro- viding animal habitat, and so forth. 4. A landscape commonly refers to a heterogeneous land area composed of a cluster of interacting ecosystems.Understanding, quantifying, and managing the interactionsamong the component ecosystems is key in landscape-levelapproaches. 5. Although the watershed approach has elements of a landscape approach, inadequate attention to landscape-level tradeoffs can result in negative hydrological implica-tions for downstream stakeholders outside the watershedbut within the landscape. In addition, a long-term approachis needed to determine the system's sustainability. 6. The landscape approach seeks to assess optimal paths for achieving objectives and the limits that exist in scalingup as not all advantages can be derived through scaling up across ecosystems. 7. Forest areas beyond the frontier are those that have most of the world's forest area, few inhabitants, and no landscarcity. 8. Frontier and disputed forest areas are where agriculture is expanding and there are conflicts over forest use in \"openaccess\" areas. SELECTED READINGS Bonell, M., and L. A. Bruijnzeel. 2004.

The purpose ofplanning is to develop management and governance strate-gies that respond to scientific understanding of natural and social systems as well as changing societal conditions andvalues. The simple objective of any planning process is topromote decisions that are informed, understood, accepted,and able to be implemented. Planning can be complex depending upon the number of issues internal and external to the planning area. Plan-ning requires risk assessments and forecasts about antici-pated and uncertain future events and conditions. Conse-quently, even the best plan will need to be altered to adjustto improving data and information; changing social, eco-nomic, or other conditions; evolving threats; or feedbackfrom monitoring efforts (see note 4.3, Using Adaptive Man-agement to Improve Project Implementation). Therefore,plans are adaptive in nature, and amendments or entirerevisions will be an outcome of monitoring and other fac-tors discussed in the plan. Two predominant approaches to planning are the \"threat- based\" approach, and the \"desired condition and zoning\" model. The threat-based model addresses only current threatsor those future threats that can be predicted by managers indesigning management direction. It is limited in its ability toreact to and consider unforeseen future threats that mayevolve and does not account for nonthreat-based targets andobjectives. The desired condition and zoning model, which isused by the U.S. Forestry Service (USFS) for its multiple-useplanning for National Forest lands, outlines overall goals and objectives for the landscape, as well as more specific objectiveswithin each macro-zone, to guide all future management decisions. Through the setting of objectives, the desired condition planning model describes the compositional and structuralcharacteristics of the biological and physical features desired across the landscape. It also accounts for the socialand economic needs of stakeholders that depend on land-scape resources and the social and economic elementsneeded to achieve the plan's long-term vision. In the desiredcondition approach, barriers or threats that may limit resource management ability to achieve or move toward thedesired condition are specifically addressed in guidelines,regulations, and zoning concepts. Such an approach is flex-ible and adaptable and thus able to address not only exist-ing threats, but also unforeseen future ones and nonthreat management targets. The following section outlines important operational components of the landscape planning process and the land- scape plan itself. These steps draw heavily from guidelinesprepared by the USFS as part of the U.S. Agency for Interna-tional Development (USAID) Central African Regional Pro-gram for the Environment (CARPE) initiative for guidanceto implementing nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).These guidelines offer some key steps to be undertaken toeffectively implement a landscape plan. OPERATIONAL ASPECTS Sometimes simpler plans are more effective, especially plans based on a participatory process. The likelihood that theplan will be more widely read and understood by local stakeholders, as well as the likelihood of their engagement in the process, will increase if the plan is relatively concise,focuses on what is important for the resource condition,and is light on scientific and legal jargon. Integrated Forest Landscape Land-Use PlanningNOTE 4.1 132Identify planning team members and define individu- als' specific roles. The composition (see box 4.6) and size of the team should be based on a rapid needs assessment for successful landscape plan development. The roles and responsibilities of the planning team must be defined early toreduce confusion, focus staff time, avoid duplication of effort,and ensure that all aspects of the planning process areaddressed. If any necessary skills are missing, it will be impor- tant to mention how these gaps will be filled and when. The team may be distinct from or overlap with the team working on macro-zone plans. Any alteration in roles whenworking on the various plans should be expressed. Develop a public participation strategy. The planning team needs to develop a strategy for effective stakeholder participation for the plan and the landscape concept to besuccessful (box 4.7). Sound strategies for landscape plan-ning will incorporate multiple opportunities for involve-ment and concurrence by local communities, government,relevant industry, and other stakeholders. Creating a senseof ownership among local community members and awider audience of stakeholders by involving them in plan-ning discussions and decision making improves the likeli-hood that the plan will be supported and its implementa-tion will be successful (box 4.8). An important part of the strategy is stakeholder identification. NOTE 4.1: INTEGRATED FOREST LANDSCAPE LAND-USE PLANNING 133team or program manager biologist(s) hydrologist(s) social mineral or mining specialist(s) (if mining activ- ities impact the landscape) It may not be necessary to have all of these spe- cialists on the planning team throughout the entire process; rather, some could be brought in asneeded to advise on certain issues. Responsibilities and tasks must be assigned to each planning team member and new staff or con- sultants hired to fill voids. Source: USFS 2006.Box 4.6 Commonly Required Skills in a Planning T eamThe T ongass National Forest, covering most of southeast Alaska in the United States, is managedunder the guidance of the T ongass Land and Resource Management Plan, first completed in 1979, revised in 1997, and clarified and amendedsince then. Projects are planned with help frominterested citizens: Proposed projects are listedquarterly in the district in which they will take place; contact people are provided to help citizensparticipate; and in some districts, draft documentsare posted for review. All decisions are later postedfor public viewing. All projects aim to foster thecontinued health of the forest and to provide com-modities and experiences to people who depend on or visit the forest. T ongass employees work to balance multiple uses of the forest resources: fishand wildlife populations, clean water, trees to sup-port local industry, and recreation opportunities. Source: USFS 2007.Box 4.8 Participating in the Management of the T ongass National ForestLandscape planning is broader in scope than site- specific planning and therefore requires a wide rangeof stakeholder perspectives to assess and develop pri- ority strategies. Stakeholders can include: government representatives at the national, regional, and local levels government ministry representatives that haveauthority over lands in the landscape traditional leaders extractive industry representatives operating inor near the landscape local and international NGO representativesoperating on the landscape marginalized groups that may not have a voiceas part of the above groups military leaders individuals claiming ancestral rights to lands community members that are able to representresource users local hunters and fishermen others to be determined Source: USFS 2006.Box 4.7 Who Are the Landscape Stakeholders?Identify existing and needed information about the landscape. Information should enable analysis of the demographic, political, and governance situation of the landscape, as well as its physical, biological, and ecological conditions, to determine the current condition and futuretrends. However, a lack of perfect information should notindefinitely delay progress with planning processes. Datagathering should be viewed as an ongoing process and new information should feed back into the adaptive manage-ment aspect of the landscape plan. Processes for data gathering should include asking stake- holders to identify their existing resource use and interests onthe landscape; threats, opportunities, or conflicts related to the landscape; and why and how the landscape is important to them. In addition to information within the landscape,planning teams should look at influences outside the land-scape. Examine what is occurring outside the landscape thatcould affect the important values of the landscape. For exam-ple, are there plans to develop any infrastructure (roads,dams, and the like) that could affect values within the land-scape? Is there potential for immigrants settling in the land-scape because of displacement from another area? An important step in the landscape planning process is identifying and evaluating existing applicable laws or anyexisting management plans associated with the landscape. Understanding legislation applied to any land unit in thelandscape will help guide management decisions. It is impor-tant to monitor legislative changes throughout the landscapeplanning process so that adjustments to the planning processcan be made if necessary. For example in the DemocraticRepublic of Congo, landscape planning teams need to moni-tor the forest concession conversion process because it canaffect both the landscape land-use plan and the subsequentmacro-zone management plans. Define why the particular landscape was delineated, and what features make it a priority. The objective of this description is to provide a focus for the planningprocess. This description should remain brief and focus onthe key features that contributed to its designation as a pri-ority landscape. Characterize the landscape, including the existing uses of the landscape and the different groups involved in those uses; the legal boundaries delineated within the landscape;and a general inventory of the resources and any informa-tion regarding their condition. This characterization shoulddescribe the physical, ecological, and socioeconomic condi-tions in a simple manner and identify influences outside thelandscape that could affect the important values of the land- scape, identify and evaluate applicable laws within the land-scape, and identify key information gaps. This information will assist the planning team to define landscape vision and objectives, help inform zoning decisions and managementstrategies, and identify any knowledge gaps (see box 4.9). 134 CHAPTER 4: OPTIMIZING FOREST FUNCTIONS IN A LANDSCAPEThe following information is helpful in character- izing landscapes:a.

Map locations of economically desirable timber species or mineral deposits not cur-rently in any concessions d. Assess government management authority presence on the landscape and capacity to playa role in the planning process e. Outline budget and timeline Source: USFS 2006.Box 4.9 Baseline Data Needed on Aspects of the Forest LandscapeInvolve relevant stakeholders in defining desired conditions for the landscape. The desired conditions will help provide context and direction for the rest of the planning process and should aim to maintain the land- scape's unique features and significance, improve resourceconditions on the landscape, and promote livelihoodopportunities for those dependent on landscape resources(see box 4.10). The desired condition sets an idealized goal of what the landscape should be, what it should protect, and whom it should benefit. Develop landscape objectives that describe the focus of management activities on the landscapeover an extended period. Objectives are important because they support and describe the desired conditions for a given element or attribute of the landscape. The objec- tives should be unambiguous, measurable, and have a time line. It is essential to involve stakeholders in the develop-ment of objectives because different stakeholders may dis-agree about which objectives are or are not compatible withthe shared view of the desired conditions. Objectives should be listed in order of priority, where possible. Landscape objectives can be explored through simple discussions, but the process is much more instructive iftools are used to enhance understanding (see box 4.11).Visualization can be very valuable, with participants beingencouraged to draw desirable and undesirable outcomes. Ifthe resources are available, simple simulation models can bedeveloped; these can be instructive in helping participantsunderstand the full ramifications of landscape change (Eco-agriculture Partners and International Union for Conserva-tion of Nature 2007). Implement an iterative zoning process. Zoning decisions are often considered the heart of a land-use plan and can be contentious. Zoning decisions should be based on all quanti-tative and qualitative information gathered. The planningprocess should include a validation step to confirm that theproposed location for each macro-zone reflects on-the- ground reality. The zoning process often has to follow an iter-ative approach because as data are gathered and stakeholderinterests identified, the planning team refines zone bound-aries to come up with a configuration that best responds tothe vision, objectives, and priorities of the landscape. 3 Develop guidelines (similar to a set of rules or regu- lations) that describe permissible or prohibited activ-ities across a landscape or zones within a landscape. Guidelines ensure that certain aspects of a landscape maintain their integrity and that various activities occur, or are prohib-ited, so as not to harm valued attributes. Guidelines shouldprohibit or permit specific activities or actions. If any excep-tions to a guideline are to be granted, the guideline should explicitly describe the circumstances under which such anexemption would be granted and who has the authority togrant it. Existing laws in the country where the landscape islocated may address issues or activities outlined in a guideline.Where appropriate, these laws should be referenced in the guidelines; however, the guidelines may be more stringent than the existing regulations. Guidelines are more often usedat the macro- and microzone levels, but in some situations, itmay make sense to establish landscape-wide guidelines. NOTE 4.1: INTEGRATED FOREST LANDSCAPE LAND-USE PLANNING 135Different people have very different understand- ings of the concept of a landscape and often havetrouble articulating their differences. Getting stakeholders to draw the landscape on a large sheet of paper or white board as a facilitated group exer-cise helps to generate a valuable discussion of whatpeople value in the landscape. This enables every-one to participate in planning and assessing con- servation and development and is a valuable wayof tapping into local knowledge. This approachcan be valuable at the initiation of a project or dur-ing implementation. It is especially valuable in sit-uations where there are upstream and downstreamlinks that need to be made explicit or where con- nectivity of habitats is an issue. T o enable this process, a facilitator with artistic skills can encourage stakeholders to represent their perspectives of the landscape onto a map or sketchof the visible landscape. People will rapidly beginto argue and discuss the significance of differentlandscape features. The picture can then beimproved by the facilitator, and eventually itshould be possible to work toward a graphic repre-sentation of a desirable future landscape. Theprocess is more effective if the images are editeddigitally, which requires that the facilitator be ableto use appropriate graphic software, such as Pho- toshop, Illustrator, or Paintbrush. Useful progresscan be made in less than a day with a small groupof stakeholders. Associated costs include the timeof the participants and a facilitator. Source: Sayer 2006.Box 4.10 Participatory Mapping for Identifying the Landscape ValueDevelop a work plan reflecting the implementation schedule. This work plan will provide prioritized action items with a timeline and a budget to accomplish the work. It is appropriate to include a description of how stakehold- ers will be involved. Most actions will be concentratedwithin the macro-zone management plans; however, impor-tant cross-zone issues and current conditions and futuretrends are better identified at the landscape scale. All imple- mentation activities should be linked back to one or more ofthe landscape objectives. The schedule should specify whataction items will be accomplished, by whom, and when, andthe associated cost. Develop a monitoring protocol. This protocol will help determine if the landscape plan and associated plans underit are effectively contributing to the achievement of the land- scape's desired condition and objectives. Monitoring willprovide the feedback loop for evaluating and updating the plan (see note 4.2, Assessing Outcomes of Landscape Inter- ventions). Landscape-wide monitoring is typically con-ducted to evaluate conditions and trends of specificresources on the landscape. The monitoring protocol shouldindicate the type and frequency of monitoring, as well as who is responsible for carrying it out and reporting on it. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS This note's guidance on planning needs to be tailored to the specific context of the region in question and to the 136 CHAPTER 4: OPTIMIZING FOREST FUNCTIONS IN A LANDSCAPEThe Bank's project in Natural Resource Management in Albania used a Participatory Microcatchment (MC)Planning Approach to collect information and data to fully understand the physical and socioeconomic con- ditions of the MC. This included collection of existinginformation (data and maps), data verification andupdating, and supplementation of available informa-tion with further simple surveys. MC plans build on forest and pasture management plans for communalforestry and pasture activities and refer to the keyactions they identify (if these plans have already beenprepared). T o integrate various viewpoints in each village, the project conducted an exercise called Beneficiary- Centered Problem Census Problem Solving (BCPCPS). BCPCPS is a nonthreatening, focused discussion thatuses small group dynamics to elicit (i) a complete andranked census of the real and perceived problems ofindividual households, villages, and the commune as awhole; and (ii) the commune's proposed solutions tothese problems. This approach provides a setting inwhich all members of the commune can contribute.No problem is rejected and all solutions are consid-ered. The final ranking of problems and preferred solu-tions is performed by the villagers. The contribution ofthe team is limited to facilitating the creation of thesetting in which the BCPCPS approach can be con- ducted. The team does not take part in the discussionnor make promises. Project staff has to ensure that women and children are not marginalized in the BCPCPS process. A \"priority list of village problems\" is developed by the team and the problems that are outside the man-date of the project are eliminated as the list is finalized. This list is used as the basis of a joint discussion of thesolutions to the problems identified by the villagers.During this discussion, a suggested \"menu of activities\"prepared in advance by the team, is shared with the vil-lage community to contribute to solving the problemsidentified. The menu of activities often consists of rehabilitation activities and income-generation activi- ties (or income-supporting activities). Based on discussions, the villagers choose activities that meet their priorities. Often farmers make addi-tional demands, particularly for income-generatingactivities. However, it was made clear to the villagersthat the resources (money and time) available underthe project were limited and that the project wouldsupport those activities and measures that focus mostof the benefits at the level of the MC, that are costeffective, and that can be replicated in other parts ofAlbania. Box 4.11 T ools for Integrating Various Viewpoints Source: Cestti 2005. a. This menu of activities is a basic tool in the planning process. The team determines on technical, economic, and institution al grounds which treatments are applicable in a particular MC and prepares the menu. The menu may vary in accordance with the agroecological and socioeconomic conditions of each village as well as the villagers' resources and needs. During the life of the project, it would be revised based on the experience with project implementation.needs of implementing partners and involved government agencies. Overall, the planning approach adopted at the landscape level needs to be flexible and able to accommodate new information, monitoring results, changing contexts, andresource conditions. An adaptive management approachmay be adopted to allow for individual components of theplan to be amended or altered (see note 4.3, Using Adaptive Management to Improve Project Implementation). While it is ideal to put a great deal of effort into each step of the planning process, implementation and monitoringactivities and limited financial and human resources willprevent planning teams and authorities from meeting ideal levels of action. Therefore, it is important that the planning team prioritize. Honest assessments of available funds andcosts of specific activities must be carried out by the plan-ning team, in conjunction with stakeholders, to determinewhat can truly be accomplished with limited resources andwhich activities should be prioritized. The planners mustalso evaluate what other stakeholders are, or could be, doingto complement actions taken by the team and implement-ing partners. Participatory processes succeed where there are common purposes that could interest all or most of the population,where the participatory process is flexible and provides for capacity building and genuine empowerment, and wherethere are income and livelihood incentives. The planningprocess has to allow for the inclusion of both communityinterests at the micro-zone level and the larger-scale objec-tives. Furthermore, while adopting a genuinely bottom-upapproach to institutional development is essential, govern-ment commitment to landscape planning is critical to itssuccess. NOTES 1. This note was adapted from a guide developed by the USFS for the Congo Basin Forests of Central Africa as part of USAID's CARPE initiative. CARPE is a 20-year initiative with the objective of reducing the rate of deforestation and the loss of biodiversity in the Congo Basin Region of Cen-tral Africa. While the approach used in the USAID CARPEinitiative is still under development, and thus cannot bepointed to as a success story just yet, it is hoped that the experience there can guide future successful planningefforts. The first phase of CARPE (1995-2002) focused on research and capacity building in the region. CARPE's sec-ond phase introduced a more focused approach to programimplementation, concentrating CARPE activities in 12 landscapes across the region. These landscapes were chosenfor their biodiversity and conservation importance andestablished as foundations of regional conservation and sus-tainable natural resource use. CARPE focuses on the larger landscape unit to maximize impact, to promote improved natural resource managementover larger areas, and to broaden stakeholder involvement inland management activities. In light of this need for multiple-use management expertise of large landscapes, CARPE lead-ership has requested that the USFS take on a more strategicapproach within the program to better benefit from USFS land management expertise gained from 100 years of experi-ence in the United States. T o that end, the USFS has beenasked to develop planning guidelines for comprehensivelandscape-level planning and the different use zones (asdefined by CARPE) within those landscapes: protected areas,community use, and extractive use. The objectives of thislandscape planning process are to (i) provide planning toolsand standards to support the promotion of sustainable natu-ral resource management in the landscapes by CARPE part-ners, host-country governments, and other stakeholders; (ii)highlight processes to encourage stakeholder involvement inland-use planning; and (iii) provide useful standards forCARPE management to monitor program progress. CARPE landscape land-use planning prioritizes three types of zones to be delineated within the landscapes: Pro-tected Area (PA), Community Based Natural ResourceManagement (CBNRM), and Extractive Resource (ERZ)use zones. These are referred to as macrozones. Each ofthese macro-zones will, in turn, also be zoned for differinguses and levels of resource protection. Additional USFS planning guides are available to assist in the development ofmanagement plans for these macrozones. 2. In the context of CARPE, landscape planning will define the CARPE implementing partner activities on each indi-vidual landscape that are needed to improve land manage- ment conditions across the landscape. The activities out-lined in the landscape plans and the subsequent macro-zoneplans will contribute to the long-term management andsustainability of forest resources in the region and thereby contribute to the development of livelihood strategies andeconomic development activities for those dependent uponthese resources. 3. The advantage of this focused approach is that it invests the limited planning time and money on the areas consid- ered critical within the landscape. As information is gath-ered and new trends or needs emerge, additional zones canbe designated. T o add a new zone, an abbreviated approachto the landscape planning process, focusing on stakeholderinvolvement, should be used.

Forforest interventions, this can mean assessing externali-ties and measuring delayed impacts of the intervention.Monitoring and evaluation methods typically emphasize either the state of species (or ecosystems) or simply theeffectiveness of providing project deliverables and out-puts (Stem and others 2005). The approaches used oftenhave limited ability to address where the balancebetween the different objectives from the forest land- scape should lie. The real challenge for landscape approaches is to assess the multiple functions of forests at the local and land- scape levels. These are the levels at which managementdecisions are made and for which information on statusand trends is required. The problems of assessment arefurther complicated where management is seeking toachieve multiple functions across a mosaic of forest andnonforest lands (Sayer and Maginnis 2005). Assessmentand monitoring schemes in which tradeoffs are inherentin management require multidimensional tools, andprogress must be measured across multiple axes (Sayer and Maginnis 2005). The methods should also provideplatforms for negotiating tradeoffs. T ough questions needto be tackled, including the following: In areas of landshortage, how much natural forest might be sacrificed toprovide additional agricultural options for local people;and, in areas with global environmental values, is placingrestrictions on the development options of the poor justi-fied? Forest agencies have often made unwarrantedassumptions about what is desired by, or good for, localpeople. It is clear that more objective and equitableprocesses are needed.OPERATIONAL ASPECTS The development of a monitoring framework ideally should be initiated at the beginning of the landscape trackingprocess. The framework should be closely linked to the forest landscape land-use plan and should clearly identify how the monitoring information will be used to inform the decision-making process and implementation of the intervention. Use a hierarchical framework for monitoring. In the context of landscape activities, a hierarchical framework is often needed for relevance at different spatial scales and tobe able to capture the impact of the activity, as well as toidentify changes occurring over time. Clearly articulate goals and desired outcomes. Well- defined objectives for the forest landscape are important for monitoring performance (see note 4.1, Integrated ForestLandscape Land-Use Planning). Define criteria. In the hierarchical monitoring frame- work, the broad goals are considered to be universally appli- cable. It is useful, then, to have subsidiary goals from the planthat serve as landscape performance criteria and that identifythe desirable outcomes for the landscape (Buck and others2006). There can be several performance criteria (subsidiarygoals) associated with each goal. These specify the direction in which a healthy forest landscape ideally should be moving. Use the landscape objectives. The landscape objectives agreed on among stakeholders as part of the planning process should indicate the desirable future state of a landscape. Thisinformation is key to tracking changes in a landscape. Identify appropriate indicators. Indicators are often landscape specific. A participatory process of indicator 139Assessing Outcomes of Landscape InterventionsNOTE 4.2identification can be useful for strategically selecting cost- effective indicators that can provide accurate information.Indicators can range from very broad to very specific. Fur- thermore, indicators may be layered such that an analysis begins with broad indicators and then adds increasinglyspecific indicators until the information needs are met(Buck and others 2006). The selected indicators should be relevant, precise, sensi- tive, easy to understand, and measurable. Measurement indi- cators must be able to recognize tradeoffs (short-term versuslong-term, at different scales, for different stakeholders) thatneed to be addressed in the landscape for the indicators to becredible. When employing a landscape approach, more thanjust the physical indicators should be measured; local liveli- hood outcomes also should be assessed (see box 4.12). There may be multiple indicators associated with a spe- cific criterion\u2014some amenable to measurement at the landscape scale and others suitable for the site level. Simi-larly, indicators may vary by whether they are used to mea-sure the state of a landscape or the impact of particularinterventions on landscape performance (see box 4.13). At the landscape level it is realistic for performance to be measured not by whether a desirable end condition has been achieved, but by assessing whether the combination ofinfluences affecting change is moving the landscape in theright direction relative to stated performance criteria. 140 CHAPTER 4: OPTIMIZING FOREST FUNCTIONS IN A LANDSCAPEBiophysical indicators. Specific indicators will depend on the objectives that have been identified for the land- scape, and may include, but are not limited to: species of concern human disturbances wildlife corridors infrastructure impacts external threats to the landscape ecological function and conditionThese measures should give a sense of deforestation, drivers for change in the landscape, level of fragmenta- tion, the condition of the forests, and the population of species of concern. Livelihood indicators. Livelihood indicators can be based on the capital assets framework. These indicators can be applied to a sample of communities and thenaggregated to a landscape scale. The capital assetsframework has five types of capital: (i) financial, (ii)social, (iii) natural, (iv) human, and (v) physical. Financial capital can include measures of: formal sector employment household income price changes in basic products number of local credit associations Social capital can include measures of: community-based initiatives traditional governance effectiveness perceptions of levels of corruption state agency effectivenessNatural capital can include measures of: deforestation rates frequency and size of fires extent of certified forests quality of land available for agricultural production Human capital can include measures of: quality of clinics and health care quality of education number of qualified people infant mortality level and use of traditional knowledge Physical capital can include measures of: household quality number of kiosks selling basic products sources of drinking water village accessibility Specific monitoring activities will depend on the objectives that have been identified for the landscape, and may include, but are not limited to: development of local communities species of concern human disturbances wildlife corridors infrastructure impacts external threats to the landscape ecological function and conditionBox 4.12 Potential Indicators to Monitor Source: Authors' compilation using USFS 2006 and Buck and others 2006.NOTE 4.2: ASSESSING OUTCOMES OF LANDSCAPE INTERVENTIONS 141\u007f Land cover: portion of landscape in natural habitat, moderate use, and intense use.

Note: Geographic Information System. Means of measure (MM) are given in italics. Identify approach for monitoring. Multiple approaches are available for monitoring and evaluating interventions, and data can come from various sources (primary data; data from local laypersons, local experts, or outside technical experts using advanced technological tools and analyticalmethods). Identifying the most appropriate approach willrequire a clear understanding of the context, working withinparameters such as available resources, and identifying approaches that will draw on readily available qualitative andquantitative information. (See box 4.14 for one approach.) Use technological tools to enrich the debate about future landscape scenarios. These same tools can also be used by special interest groups to excessively influenceactivities or processes. It is therefore important that tech-nology not dominate or drive the process but be put at theservice of stakeholders in an equitable and transparent fash-ion (Ecoagriculture Partners and IUCN 2007). Specify who is responsible for monitoring and the appropriate frequency and format. The monitoring protocol should indicate the type and frequency of moni-toring, as well as who is responsible for carrying it out and reporting on the monitoring. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS Monitoring and assessment systems must be flexible to be able to function in a highly dynamic social and economicenvironment (see note 4.3, Using Adaptive Management to Improve Project Implementation). Consistent monitoring over time allows for changes to be tracked continuously. Theindicators and means of measurement to be used must bechosen and used consistently over time; data sets are oftenrendered useless if they are too flexible. Stakeholder perceptions of desirable outcomes will change with time, and the need for interventions to achieve desirable landscape conditions may also change. While flex-ibility is important, consistency over time is critical to track-ing change meaningfully\u2014the indicators and means of measurement must be enduring. Monitoring should be continual and not simply consist of an update to the baseline information at the very end ofthe intervention. It should be an ongoing process through which periodic monitoring is used to modify, as necessary,the implementation of the project (see chapter 7, Monitor- ing and Information Systems for Forest Management).

Theoutcome assessment approach is based upon negotia- tions among all stakeholders on what they want the landscape to look like and what it is to deliver, that is,how they want the landscape to perform. Indicatorsthen have to be selected that will measure change in thelandscape and how that will correspond to the desired performance criteria. Indicators of changes in differentcategories of landscape values (natural, built, human,and social value categories) provide a basis for assessingthe impact of interventions from a holistic perspective. This approach is particularly useful in situations where an intervention is anticipated to impact a land- scape mosaic, for instance, in determining and then assessing an appropriate balance between the amountof forest needed for conservation and the amount thatmight be converted to agriculture or other uses. Out-come assessment methodologies are consistent withcommonly employed participatory techniques forplanning and evaluating interventions; the techniquesshould thus be used early in project formulation to ensure clarity of desired project effects on landscapeoutcomes and establish the basis for measuring them. The indicator sets can be developed in a few days during a multistakeholder meeting. A technical person, or small team, will then need to conduct the first, base-line assessment. This may require extensive field sur-veys and, depending upon the complexity of the situa- tion and the availability of data, may take severalmonths. The process will have to be repeated every yearto track progress, so an annual meeting will be neededto review progress and adapt management as needed. The costs associated with this approach include those of the facilitator for the first meeting and techni- cal staff hired for several months to assemble data. Landscape-scale outcome assessment approaches capture the broader impacts of any intervention\u2014a policy change, financial incentive, new projects, and soforth\u2014on the landscape. They could complementrates of return studies in negotiating possible external-ities of an intervention and then measuring them.Box 4.14 Outcome Assessment Tracking Source: Sayer 2006.Conservation and development interventions take place in complex systems influenced by biological,political, social, economic, and cultural factors. 1 Project managers and practitioners operating within thesecomplex systems must make important decisions, yet theyoften have limited information and are operating in the face of uncertainty. This complexity is compounded at the land- scape scale, where a larger geographical space, including allfunctions and processes and additional institutionsinvolved, needs to be considered. The approach adopted atthe landscape level needs to be flexible and able to accom- modate new information and changing contexts (see chap-ter 4, Optimizing Forest Functions in a Landscape). Thisnote addresses the use of an adaptive managementapproach to project implementation, a method for makingmore informed decisions about strategies, testing the effec- tiveness of strategies used, and learning and adapting to improve the strategies (Lee 1993; Gunderson, Holling, andLight 1995). OVERVIEW AND CONSIDERATIONS OF INTEREST FOR WORLD BANK ACTIVITIES Adaptive management stands in contrast to traditional project and program management by requiring an explicitlyexperimental\u2014or scientific\u2014approach. Specifically, adap- tive management is the integration of design, management, and monitoring to systematically test assumptions to adaptand learn (Salafsky, Margoluis, and Redford 2001). Thereare three main components to adaptive management: Testing assumptions. Assumption testing involves system- atically trying different activities to achieve a desired out- come and is distinct from a random trial-and-error process. It requires clearly and explicitly articulating assumptions underlying the way in which proposed activ-ities will help achieve project goals and objectives to strate-gically select project actions. The outcomes of the activities are monitored to compare the actual to the predicted out-come. This enables the project team to understand whatworked, but more important, why it was effective. Adaptation. Several reasons may underlie the unexpected outcome of a project activity (for example, the project assumptions were wrong, the actions were poorly exe- cuted, the conditions at the project site changed, the monitoring was faulty\u2014or some combination of theseproblems). Adaptation involves reviewing and, whererelevant, changing assumptions and interventions torespond to the new information obtained through mon- itoring efforts. Learning. Learning involves systematically documenting a project team's process and results. The aim is to avoid making similar mistakes in the future and to share les- sons learned with the broader community of practice. The explicit and systematic testing of assumptions is the key facet of adaptive management that helps project teams uncover why a project was successful or faced setbacks and whether it was due to poor theory and underlying assump- tions, poor implementation, or a combination of the two(see figure 4.1). There are at least two levels at which program managers could apply adaptive management: (i) at a high programmatic level, to help them determine the strategies and types of proj- ects they should support and how well their portfolio of proj-ects is doing; and (ii) at the project level, to help the initiativesthey support go through an adaptive management process.This note focuses on the second of these levels, although theadaptive management process is important for both. OPERATIONAL ASPECTS For the purposes of explaining the adaptive management process, we use a cycle adapted from the Conservation Mea- 143Using Adaptive Management to Improve Project ImplementationNOTE 4.3sures Partnership (CMP) (2004) that has several of the same elements of other project management cycles. Adaptivemanagement is an integral part of each step in a project cycle. The main steps in adaptive management in a project management cycle are outlined in figure 4.2.There are six major steps in the adaptive management process before the process may be repeated: Clarify group's mission. Design a conceptual model based on local site conditions. 144 CHAPTER 4: OPTIMIZING FOREST FUNCTIONS IN A LANDSCAPEFigure 4.1 Necessary Ingredients for Project Success Success!

Develop a monitoring plan. Implement project and monitoring plans. Analyze data and communicate results. Project teams that want to use adaptive management need to be explicit about who is on their team, where or on what they intend to work, and what is happening at their projectsite (see box 4.15). This information lays the groundwork fordeveloping good goals and objectives, choosing the rightstrategies, and developing a sound monitoring and evalua- tion plan. Adaptive management requires that teams imple-ment their action plans and monitoring plans, analyze theextent to which they are achieving their goals and objectives,and adapt based on what they learn. Thus, adaptive manage- ment is a continuous process that involves going through theproject management cycle (or parts of it) multiple times. NOTE 4.3: USING ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT TO IMPROVE PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 145A conceptual model is a visual tool for depicting the con- text within which a project is operating and, in particu- lar, the major forces that are influencing what the proj- ect is trying to achieve. A conceptual model is a diagram that uses a series of boxes and arrows to succinctly rep-resent a set of causal relationships among factors thatare believed to impact one or more targets (what one isultimately trying to affect). Conceptual models are use- ful planning tools for project teams because they canhelp the teams determine what actions are needed to influence the factors at their site and what factors theyshould be monitoring to determine if those factors are changing with project implementation [Margoluis and Salafsky 1998; Morgan and Foundations of Success2005 (see note in reference section)]. The following conceptual model schematic is adapted from a real-world conservation project at a watershed site: In this example, the team chose the strategy of \"Improve land-use planning\" because it would influ- ence multiple factors at their site. The conceptualmodel helped the team be strategic about the activitiesthey chose and those they omitted.Box 4.15 Conceptual Models: A T ool for Portraying a Site's Context and Determining Strategies Source: Foundations of Success 2005.Forest corridors StrategyIndirect threat or opportunityDirect threat TargetReforestation with native species Cheap land Key:Failure of rural economyLobby gov't on development policiesGov't policies favorable to urban development Population growthClearing for new home constructionGlobal warming Limited gov't capacity for land use planning DamsNeed for electricity Rapid urbanizationImprove land-use planningInadequate zoning incomeMedia for caviar Pollution from domestic sewageHigh price for caviarTraditions and consumer preferences Demand for second homesGoalGoalObjective Objective ObjectiveObjective Objective ObjectiveGoalScope: Blue River watershed Sturgeon Riparian forestBlue River and tributariesUse tools to test assumptions underlying projects. T ools can include the conceptual model (see box 4.15),threat rating, and results chains (see box 4.16). 2Often proj- ect teams will develop a project without fully understandingor describing the context within which they are trying to work. The selection of the project approach may be driven by factors other than ground realities, and may not be theoptimal approach from a strategic point of view. Further-more, when assumptions are not explicit, the project teamcannot test them and learn over time whether the assump- tions are valid.The tools used to test assumptions should provide a suc- cinct and powerful representation of what is happening at the project site. Thus, they can serve as excellent communi-cations tools and important planning tools for the projectteam. Through the process of building the model together, the team should come to consensus on key forces influenc-ing the objectives of the project and identify some highleverage points for intervention. The modeling process andmodel should also help teams determine where to set goalsand objectives and what causal links they need to be testing (see Box. 4.17). 146 CHAPTER 4: OPTIMIZING FOREST FUNCTIONS IN A LANDSCAPEThe results chain is a tool that clarifies assumptions about the way in which specific strategies are believedto lead to achieving a desired impact. In the conser- vation context, results chains show how strategies contribute to reducing threats and achieving the con-servation of biodiversity or thematic targets. They arediagrams that map out a series of causal statementsthat link factors in an \"if...then\" fashion (Founda- tions of Success 2005). The basis for a results chaincomes from a conceptual model, but, as illustrated in the example below, results chains build on that model to make the logic more specific and to change theboxes from neutral factors to results the team wantsto see. Results chains are important tools for making assumptions explicit and facilitating their testing. In this example, one of the strategies this project team is undertaking is lobbying government to discouragepolicies favorable to urban development that have ledto clearing of forest corridors for new home construc-tion. The results chain shows the team's assumptions:\"If we lobby government officials on development poli-cies, then government officials will be more knowledge-able of the problems associated with urban develop-ment. If they are more knowledgeable, they will develop policies that discourage rapid urban development. If they develop these policies, the pace of urbanizationwill slow....\" The results chain lays out the logic step-by-step and provides a basis for developing indicatorsthat will help the project team determine if the logicholds. If it does not, they will be able to quickly deter-mine where in the chain their logic is faulty. Or, as illus-trated in figure 4.1, they should investigate whether theproject failure was due to poor implementation.Box 4.16 T ools for Clarifying and T esting Assumptions: Results Chains Source: Foundations of Success 2005.Extracted from the conceptual modelLobby government on development policies Lobby government on development policies Number of government officials reachedNumber of government officials able to cite at least three negative side effects of rapid urban developmentPresence of new policies discouraging rapid urban development Presence of new policies encouraging \"smart\" growthNumber of forest patches connected by corridors Average width of corridors Number of key species using corridorsAnnual rate of urbanizationNumber of sq km cleared for new homesGov't officials knowledgeable of problems with urban developmentPace of urbanization slowedGov't policies discourage rapid urban developmentDecrease in clearing for new home constructionRapid urbanizationForest corridorsGov't policies favorable to urban developmentClearing for new home construction Converted to a results chain Potential indicatorsForest corridors maintainedAnother important and useful process for determining where to intervene and what action to take is a threat rating process (examples of threat rating processes are available in Conservation Measures Partnership 2007; Margoluis and Salafsky 1998; The Nature Conservancy 2006). This processinvolves rating the direct threats identified in a model tohelp teams determine which threats are the most importantto address. This prioritization is particularly important in light of the fact that project resources are often limited andteams must make strategic choices. Derive monitoring indicators from models that make project assumptions explicit. By explicitly specify- ing the most important factors affecting project sites andlaying out the logic behind project activities, it is possible tonarrow down a vast universe of data to the most importantfactors. In box 4.16, the example indicates that the main fac-tor affecting forest corridors is clearing for new home con-struction. If this is the case, the project team should not becollecting data related to clearing for other purposes, suchas agriculture or timber harvesting\u2014unless, in goingthrough the adaptive management process, the team learnsthat these are important threats. Likewise, the diagram inbox 4.16 provides a concrete example of how a results chainwould help a team identify indicators to test whether the strategies they chose are having an impact. Explicitly define the time frame and chronology of events necessary for achieving desired impacts.Results chains and other tools can help teams specify thechronology of changes that must occur to achieve theirdesired effect. As figure 4.3 illustrates, results take longer tomaterialize as one goes further down the chain. A resultschain can help the team be very clear about when it is real-istic to see changes as a result of their intervention and helpthem communicate this information to key stakeholders.For example, the project team for the watershed site shouldnot commit that stakeholders will see any changes in clear-ing for new home construction as a result of their lobbyingefforts until 2013. Program managers often have their own project cycles for identifying, assisting, supervising, and evaluating proj-ects. T o encourage these projects to follow an adaptive man- agement approach, program managers must be engaged asearly as possible. Operationally, adaptive management sup- port to projects might involve any of the following: Help partners and stakeholders understand the value of the adaptive management process, which might require that managers engage in awareness-raising about adaptive management. Help project teams do adaptive management. Specifically, help them use a systematic process to develop sound strategic plans that will allow them to monitor their pro- ject's progress and make adjustments during the course of the project. This might be done through- one-on-one technical assistance from the program man- ager, another staff person, or a contracted consultant; - facilitated planning workshops in which one or mul- tiple project teams participate; or - a formal training course in strategic planning (in a classroom setting or online). 3 View failures and challenges as learning opportunities. This requires not penalizing project teams for poor per-formance, especially when they have been reflective and identified important lessons for current and future actions. Allow projects to change as they proceed. Adaptive man- agement involves constant adjustments as teams expand their understanding of their sites and test their assump- tions. Managers need to recognize the need for change and even encourage projects to change, as needed, whenproject teams make a good case for changing course. Require that impact evaluations be based on the planning work project teams have done through the adaptive man-agement process. If an external consultant undertakes an evaluation of a project that has gone through a good adaptive management process, the consultant should usethe assumptions teams originally documented (throughtools such as conceptual models and results chains) andthe goals and objectives they developed as the primary framework for the evaluation. However, there should beflexibility for situations in which project teams have notdone a thorough job formulating their plans.

Encouraging an adaptive management approach will help program managers overseeing multiple projects. If the projects they are supervising have followed good adaptivemanagement practices, managers should be able to readilyassess if a project is on track and, ultimately, how well theproject performed. Obviously, there is an upfront invest- ment in helping teams do adaptive management, but thatinvestment can make overall portfolio management easierand more reliable for program managers. Ideally, teams should integrate adaptive management into their projects from the beginning\u2014as soon as they begin to conceptualize their project and think about whowill be involved and where or on what they want to work.This helps them be explicit and systematic early on. Never- 148 CHAPTER 4: OPTIMIZING FOREST FUNCTIONS IN A LANDSCAPEIn the 1990s two organizations, Defensores de la Natu- raleza in Guatemala and L\u00ednea Bi\u00f3sfera in Mexico,wanted to understand how effectively sustainable agri- culture was reducing deforestation and the conditions under which it was effective. Like many conservationor development organizations, these two groups hadbeen using sustainable agriculture under the assump-tion that it would reduce forest clearing for agriculture, yet they had no concrete evidence that the use of sus-tainable agriculture actually led to reduced deforesta-tion. T o explore this question, Defensores de la Natu- raleza and L\u00ednea Bi\u00f3sfera partnered with the Biodiver-sity Support Program to implement a learning process to determine the utility of sustainable agriculture as a conservation tool. As a first step, the organizations had to make explicit the assumptions they were using in promotingsustainable agriculture techniques. One of the main assumptions is articulated in the results chain in thefigure: The groups in both countries collected data related to each of the factors in the results chain and came upwith some surprising conclusions. The assumptions inthe first two rectangular boxes in the chain held, butthere were differences regarding the third rectangularbox, \"Farmers reduce area planted.\" In Guatemala,farmers who used the sustainable agriculture tech-niques promoted by the project planted more area to maize than farmers who did not use sustainable agri-culture. In Mexico, farmers who used the same sus-tainable agriculture techniques planted less area (thus,the assumptions in the results chain held true in Mex- ico). Through more analysis, the groups were able todetermine that, in Guatemala, sustainable agricultureled to decreased investments in labor per hectare, andthe farmers used the saved labor to increase theamount of area planted or to establish cash crops inforested areas. In addition, access to land was an important factor affecting area planted and, thus, deforestation. In Guatemala, where land is relatively available, farmerslacked incentives to be efficient in their land use, soincreased their maize production by increasing areaplanted. In Mexico, where land access is restricted,farmers were much more efficient in their use of landand increased maize production by increasing yield. As a result of this work, the organizations concluded that sustainable agriculture programs that promote thesame techniques used in these sites are unlikely to con-tribute to decreased rates of deforestation if access toland is not restricted. This is an important lesson\u2014not just for the organizations carrying out this research,but for any organization working under similar condi-tions and using the same sustainable agriculture tech-niques to discourage deforestation. Adaptive manage-ment is about testing assumptions, learning, andadapting. When project teams can identify these typesBox 4.17 Adaptive Management Applied: Sustainable Agriculture in Guatemala and Mexico Source: Margoluis and others 2001. Promotion of sustainable agriculture techniquesFarmers adopt techniquesIncrease in yield/unit laborFarmers reduce area plantedReduction in clearing for agricultureForest habitat maintainedtheless, it is never too late to start doing adaptive manage- ment. Because of its iterative nature, adaptive managementmeans teams are constantly revisiting steps in the project cycle. If a team decides to take an adaptive management approach midway through a project, the team should revisiteach step and modify its action and monitoring plans, ifnecessary. Typically, teams find it enlightening to use toolslike threat ratings to determine if they are addressing prior- ity threats, conceptual models to determine what theyshould be doing, and results chains to determine if the logicfor what they are currently doing makes sense. T ogether,these tools help teams evaluate whether they are currentlytaking the \"right\" actions or if they need to change course and undertake other, more strategic actions. Although it may seem time-consuming, the process of identifying, agreeing upon, testing, and revisiting project assumptions is extremely important. Sometimes, membersfrom the same project team will hold different assumptionsabout their project site and why they are doing a particulara c t i v i t y . I t i s o n l y w h e n t h e y s i t d o w n t o g e t h e r t o s p e c i f ytheir assumptions that the differences emerge. T o truly practice adaptive management, an open learning culture needs to be in place to encourage project teams toquestion their actions, share both successes and failures, andlearn from their actions. T eams should not be afraid to admit mistakes, but at the same time, they should seek waysto remedy them and improve the project. It is important to share lessons with the team and beyond. Lessons learned through adaptive management canimprove not only the project under consideration but otherprojects operating under similar conditions and with simi-lar goals. Finally, adaptive management is not a trial-and-error process or a license to try whatever the team wants. Adaptivemanagement requires a systematic and explicitly experi-mental\u2014or scientific\u2014approach to project management. NOTES 1.

Good forest governance is characterized by predictable, open, and informed policy making based on transparentprocesses, a bureaucracy imbued with a professional ethos, an executive arm of government accountable for its actions, anda strong civil society participating in decisions related to sec-tor management and in other public affairs\u2014and all behav-ing under the rule of law. Thus, key features of good gover-nance include adherence to the rule of law, transparency and low levels of corruption, inputs of all stakeholders in decision making, accountability of all officials, low regulatory burden,and political stability (see also World Bank 2000). The rationale for the World Bank to engage in improving forest governance in client countries is twofold. On onehand, broader governance reform processes, such as decen-tralization and devolution, and public sector reforms pres-ent direct opportunities to which the forest sector needs torespond. On the other hand, illegal logging, corruption, andother forest sector crimes, such as arson, poaching, landencroachment, trade in endangered fauna and flora, andevasion of legal taxes and royalties, indicate weaknesses in forest sector governance that need to be addressed. In devel-oping countries, illegal logging in public lands alone causesestimated losses in assets and revenue in excess of US$10 billion annually, more than six times the total official devel-opment assistance dedicated to the sustainable managementof forests. In addition, about US$5 billion per year is esti-mated to be lost to uncollected taxes and royalties on legally sanctioned timber harvests, as a result of corruption (WorldBank 2004). The global magnitude of the problem as esti-mated by its direct monetary impacts is staggering. 2 The associated physical, environmental, and social impacts resulting from poor governance are even more exten- sive and serious. They are characterized by the following: Violation of protected area boundaries threatens theconservation of forest resources and biodiversity. More than 350 million rural poor rely heavily on forestsfor their livelihoods, while more than 60 million dependalmost exclusively on them for subsistence. Strong forest governance (including vesting tenurial rights with such communities) is essential for protecting their livelihoodsand improving their well-being, and for protecting themfrom the consequences of illegal logging and unautho-rized removals from the forest (World Bank 2006). Legitimate forest enterprises are subjected to unfair com- petition through price undercutting and discouragedfrom making socially and environmentally responsible investments in the sector. 151IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE CHAPTER 5Forests are a global public good, and their degradation imposes global costs, such as climate change, environ-mental degradation, and species loss. Improving gover- nance will help contain the negative environmental, eco- nomic, and social consequences at the global level. There are less visible\u2014though highly insidious\u2014costs resulting from the erosion of institutions, the spread ofcorruption across the economy, and lower growth. These spillover effects are the most far-reaching and significant aspects of the problem of poor sectoral governance. Theproblem originates in the forest sector but the impactsare transmitted through the economy, weakening gover-nance and the rule of law, impeding investments in legit- imate commerce, and undermining the overall gover-nance structure.Some of the complexities of these relationships and the magnitude of the task to improve forest governance are cap- tured in figure 5.1. The box in the center of the figure lists \"entry points,\" or opportunities within the forest sector itself, directed toward reducing the means, motives, and opportunities for crimesand misdemeanors in the forest sector (see note 5.5, Address-ing Illegal Logging and Forest Crime). The surrounding boxes indicate the \"embedded\" nature of the problem in the econ-omy and of the need for other sectors, institutions, and actorsto support and complement the within-sector efforts atimproving governance and law enforcement. They elaborate on the roles of the overall political structure; of national andinternational checks and balances; and the contributions ofcivil society, media, the private sector, and local communities. 152 CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE Figure 5.1 Identifying \"Entry Points\" and a Sustainable Reform Process to Improve Forest Governance Political accountability \u007fPolitical competition, broad-based political parties \u007fTransparency and regulation of party financing \u007fAsset declaration by legislators and parliamentarians \u007fDisclosure of parliamentary votes Checks and balances \u007fIndependent, effective judiciary \u007fIndependent oversight institutions \u007fGlobal initiatives: UN, OECD Convention, anti-money laundering and asset forfeiture Ownership and decentralization \u007fProperty and access rights \u007fDecentralization with accountability \u007fCommunity driven development \u007fOversight by user groups and citizens organizations \u007fBeneficiary participation in projectsCivil society and media \u007fFreedom of press and information \u007fCivil society watchdogs \u007fParticipatory country diagnostic surveys \u007fReport cards, client surveys Private sector interface \u007fStreamlined regulation \u007fPublic-private partnerships \u007fCorporate social responsibility Building blocks for effective forest sector management \u007fAdequate legislative frameworks and law enforcement capacity \u007fRobust institutions with a service- delivery orientation \u007fCompetent leadership based on meritocracy and technical skills \u007fInstitutional oversight including an independent forests monitor \u007fTransparent forest fiscal systems based on easy-to-track revenue flows \u007fSound sector policy conducive to competitive domestic markets and international trade Improving forest governance and legislative compliance has been the focus of international attention for a number of years. For maximum effectiveness, the World Bank's efforts in this area need to be closely aligned with those of other partners, both in client countries and at the regional andinternational levels. This is especially important becauseeffective action in this area requires collaboration amonggovernments in producer and consumer countries, private sector operators, and civil society. Since 2001, regional ForestLaw Enforcement and Governance (FLEG) ministerial con-ferences have been conducted in East Asia (2001), Africa(2003), and Europe and Northern Asia (2005). The resultingministerial declarations are important tools that can be used in the dialogue with client governments, as well as in build- ing alliances with the private sector and civil society actors.The World Bank has had a key role in facilitating these con-ferences and supporting their follow-up. Several multilateral,bilateral, civil society, and private sector initiatives have alsooriginated from these efforts, which can provide traction forthe World Bank's work in this area. An independent and especially relevant initiative is the European Union (EU) Regulation and Action Plan on ForestLaw Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT). An essen-tial part of the EU FLEGT is the negotiation of Voluntary Part-nership Agreements (VPAs) between the EU and interested timber-producing countries. VPAs aim to develop an agree-ment between producing and importing EU countries thatonly timber originating legally will be exported and allowed tobe imported. If successful, the implementation of the VPAswill result in increasing demand for country-level financing insuch areas as strengthening and reforming laws, regulations,and institutions in the forest sector; strengthening the capac-ity of indigenous and rural communities to manage forestssustainably; independent certification of sustainable forestmanagement; implementation of timber tracking systems;forest products and trade-related information and statistics;and monitoring of forest cover changes to detect illegal activi-ties. This will provide both the need and opportunities forimproved collaboration between bilateral and multilateralfinancing institutions, including the World Bank. The FLEG initiative enables the World Bank's project managers and task team leaders to incorporate FLEG intotheir projects using the political momentum and stake-holder coalitions it creates. PAST ACTIVITIES A review by the World Bank's Operations Evaluation Depart- ment of the performance of the World Bank's 1991 ForestsStrategy (Lele et al. 2000) pointed to the failure to address governance issues as a serious gap in the World Bank's workin forestry and recommended that the World Bank helpreduce illegal logging by actively promoting improved gover-nance and enforcement of laws and regulations because poorlaws and legislation and poor enforcement are fundamentalfailings in the sector. As a result, the World Bank placed for-est governance and illegal logging high on the agenda in its2002 Forests Strategy. Indeed, the World Bank committeditself to collaborate with borrower countries and partners toreduce by half the estimated annual financial losses from ille-gal logging by 2013. Likewise, the World Bank's 2001 envi-ronment strategy emphasizes the comparative advantage ofthe World Bank in supporting better governance, increasedtransparency, access to environmental information, andpublic participation in client countries (World Bank 2001). The earliest explicit attention to forest crimes in Bank project design was in the Philippines in 1983 in the contextof the Multisectoral Forest Protection Committees. Theseissues started to appear in a more systematic way in projectdesign in the 1990s. Adjustment operations in Papua NewGuinea in the 1990s supported the introduction of privatesector administration of log export taxation. Work in Cam- bodia in the late 1990s involved the first use by the WorldBank of forest law enforcement professionals in policyanalysis and project design. Experiments in third-partyindependent monitoring of forest crime reporting, supportfor case tracking systems, and recommendations for timbertheft prevention planning were among the innovations. InAfrica, similar work, including independent forest moni-tors, was developed in Cameroon, and timber and postcon-flict issues are now being addressed in Liberia (see box 5.7). Country Assistance Strategies. T o examine the extent to which FLEG and related issues are taken into account in Bank Country Assistance Strategies (CASs) today, a reviewof the most recent CASs for 18 forest-rich countries was car-ried out in 2006 (World Bank 2006). These 18 countriesrepresent 75 percent of all forests in developing countries.Of these 18 CASs, 17 mention forestry, with 11 containingexplicit forestry components. Nine CASs mention FLEG issues specifically, with at least seven outlining FLEG activi-ties (both lending and nonlending) to be undertaken. FiveCASs link deforestation to governance issues, and sixdescribe links between poverty and deforestation. Lending operations. A review in 2006 (World Bank 2006) found there are currently more than 50 active forestry proj- ects in the World Bank's lending portfolio, with a total cost of CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE 153US$2.7 billion and total Bank commitment of US$1.6 billion. A recent assessment of these projects showed that some 35projects have clearly identified FLEG components, totaling an estimated US$310.8 million. Thus, FLEG activities account for 11 percent of total project costs across all 51 forestry proj-ects and 22 percent of total project costs for the 35 projectswith forest governance components (also see table 5.1). With regard to specific FLEG activities, some of the areas of forest governance addressed in World Bank projects include the following (see box 5.1 for country-specific examples): development of national-level forestry policies and man- agement plans; capacity development for public agencies to betteraddress forest crimes; support for public awareness activities; support for natural resource inventories, transparency inconcession allocation, forest certification, and chain-of-custody verification; and development of forest law enforcement reporting andmonitoring systems and provision of equipment andcapacity development for staff responsible for manage- ment of protected areas. Analytical and advisory activities and other non- lending activities.

These activities provide a foundation for definingstrategic priorities and informing policy dialogue and deci- sions on projects and programs and comprise economic and sector work, nonlending technical assistance, and knowledgemanagement, as well as training and research services. The World Bank also has prepared country-level forest sector reviews in several countries with a focus on FLEG. Furthermore, as part of its analytical and advisory work andas an integral part of its strategic approach to forest gover-nance, the World Bank has actively supported internationaland regional initiatives on forest governance (see box 5.2),including the three regional ministerial FLEG conferences. At the country level, the World Bank has supported the development of national-level action plans related to con-trolling illegal logging and improving forest sector trans-parency for Albania, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,Indonesia, and Russia. In some cases, World Bank workrelated to investments in other sectors also involves issues of illegal logging and forest governance. KEY ISSUES Finding ways to improve forest governance is a challengingtask. In addition, poor governance in the sector is often symp-tomatic of poor governance in the overall economy, com- pounding the problem. For example, illegal money generated from forest crimes often fuels \"slush funds\" for corruption inother sectors, including campaign financing, speculation,gambling, and human and drug trafficking, all of which havedeep negative impacts on the economy at large. This access to illegal money also creates powerful vested interests, bothwithin and outside the sector, which tend to benefit from thestatus quo and therefore strongly oppose any reforms. Approaches to addressing forest governance and law enforcement must deal with, among other things, issues con- nected to land tenure arrangements, access rights (see note 1.4, CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE 155The forestry portfolio is nested within the World Bank's overall approach to governance and anticorrup-tion and is consistent with a wide range of governance work being led by other sectors in the World Bank. Some of the more relevant work of other parts of the World Bank Group on governance includes sup- port to Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper processesand the alignment of the World Bank's CAS with these processes, work on governance diagnostics and inte-gration of governance and anticorruption elements inthe CASs, and the design of specific capacity-buildingprograms based on the diagnostic surveys (PovertyReduction and Economic Management Network andthe World Bank Institute). Other relevant areas of the World Bank's work focus on anti-money laundering and financial investigation, the Extractive IndustriesTransparency Initiative, Justice for the Poor, and cus-toms modernization. The World Bank's legal depart-ment has carried out important work in developing abenchmark study for assessing the quality of legal andregulatory frameworks. The Department of Institu-tional Integrity's investigative approaches to allega-tions of corruption in Bank-funded projects providepotentially powerful instruments to combat illegal log-ging and forest crimes. Similarly, some of the workwith corporate social responsibility and social and environmental issues in the operations of the Interna-tional Finance Corporation (IFC) (for example, invest- ment safeguard policies) is extremely relevant to FLEG issues (see note 3.2, Forest Certification Systems). The forestry work of the World Bank Group needs to be more consciously informed by and aligned withthese initiatives. The expertise accumulated in these specialized fields is only now being brought to bear onthe problems of forestry. Where it has been applied, forexample, in anti-money laundering, it is clear thatthere is enormous potential to address problems in thesector. There are also potential advantages for thesespecialized initiatives to work with forestry because this can provide an important sectoral entry point on which to ground the specialized efforts. Joint analytic work needs to be strengthened across the World Bank's organizational boundaries, specialistsfrom other areas need to be familiarized with the spe-cial circumstances of forestry, and understandingamong external stakeholders of the relevance of thesetools needs to be improved. Transaction costs involvedin working across sectoral lines can be significant andinternal incentives need to be aligned to encouragecross-sectoral collaboration.Box 5.2 Finding Synergies Between the World Bank Group's Efforts in FLEG and Its Broader Governance Reforms for Greater Impact Source: World Bank 2006. Property and Access Rights), overly complex laws and regula- tions biased against the poor (see note 5.3, \"StrengtheningLegal Frameworks in the Forest Sector), and transparency and stakeholder participation in decisions directly affecting their livelihoods. However, an increasing trend toward decentraliza-tion (both administrative and fiscal), coupled with increasedwillingness of governments to allow operation of multistake- holder processes, has created unique demands as well as opportunities for better and different forms of governance(see note 5.1, Decentralized Forest Management, and 5.2,Reforming Forest Institutions). These considerations havebeen complemented by the universal commitment to the Mil-lennium Development Goals dealing especially with issues of equity and the rights of poor and indigenous forest commu- nities. Thus, decentralization and participation are crucialissues that are extensively discussed in this sourcebook (seenote 5.1, Decentralized Forest Management). A forest fiscal system is needed that, in its broadest terms, influences revenue flows in and out of the sector as well asincome distribution across various stakeholder groupswithin the sector. A well-designed and well-functioning fis-cal system is an important instrument with which to addresssustainable resource utilization and equity and rural devel-opment issues, and to minimize the risks of corruption (seenote 5.4, Strengthening Fiscal Systems in the Forest Sector). In addition, combating large-scale criminal activities requires targeted action to directly improve forest law enforcement so that criminals are apprehended and pun- ished. Combating large-scale criminal activities would alsoinclude more fundamental changes to improve the broadergovernance environment in the forest sector and in societyat large to help strengthen law enforcement efforts (see note5.5, Addressing Illegal Logging and Other Forest Crimes). In many countries, law enforcement capacity and expert- ise exists in other sectors and needs to be marshaled in newways to support forest development. In others, specializedcapacity needs to be developed within forestry agencies.Exploitation of new enforcement innovations and opportu-nities, made possible, for example, by the introduction ofanti-money-laundering legislation, the adoption of the UNConventions against Transnational Organized Crime andCorruption, and by other new legal and judicial innova-tions, will require new skills and capacity. FUTURE PRIORITIES AND SCALING-UP ACTIVITIES Support decentralization and devolution of forest management responsibilities. Decentralization anddevolution based on the principle of subsidiarity, are means to promote more democratic and equitable management offorest resources and increase the contribution of the sectorto poverty reduction. Decentralization and devolutionprocesses can create imbalances and unforeseen negativeconsequences if they are not carefully managed and accom-panied by sufficient capacity building, allocation of finan-cial resources, and creation of mechanisms for downwardaccountability at the decentralized levels. Bureaucratic resis-tance to change at the central level, as well as powerfulvested interests, can often swing the policy pendulum fromdecentralization and devolution back to re-centralization,reversing progress and resulting in incoherent policies andregulations. Protect the rights of and empower indigenous and local communities through governance reformprocesses. Specific attention should be given to using governance reform processes to protect the rights of andempower indigenous and local communities. This can pre-vent unintended and potentially adverse impacts on forest-dependent livelihoods and traditional rights (see also note1.3, Indigenous Peoples and Forests, and chapter 12, Apply- ing OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples). Continue to engage in institutional and legal sys- tem reforms in the forest sector. The World Bank, with its engagement in diverse sectors, helps governments tailorforest sector reform processes to the country context andeffectively implement them. A model that works for a post-conflict country (for example, Liberia or the DemocraticRepublic of Congo) may be very different from what is pos-sible in a country in transition from a centralized, one-partygovernance structure to a democratic model (for example,the experience of the former communist countries of East-ern Europe). (See note 5.2, Reforming Forest Institutions,for discussion on key principles and structures.) Assist in enabling and designing fiscal system reforms that are economically and administrativelyefficient. Fiscal system reforms that are economically and administratively efficient allow for appropriate rent capture. As part of this process, the World Bank should assist gov-ernments in assessing the appropriateness of structuringforest fiscal systems to achieve secondary objectives, such asequity and sustainable rural development. Center FLEG activities at the country level around more effective integration of the work in the forest 156 CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE sector with broader governance and anticorrup- tion efforts. Such instruments as anti-money-laundering and asset forfeiture laws, crime monitoring techniques, cus- toms modernization, and governance diagnostics need to be brought into the picture to combat illegal logging and otherforest crime. This will require both helping client countriesto establish effective mechanisms for intersectoral coordina-tion and collaboration and joint action (such as dedicated forest crime task forces) and joint work by the respectiveBank departments and units. Work to move actions against forest crime forward. Given the importance of international demand as a driver ofillegal logging and other forest crime, the regional FLEGprocesses should continue to play an important role in cre-ating political commitment and joint action by producerand consumer countries to address these issues. This workincreasingly needs to become part of the agenda of existinginternational, regional, and subregional organizations andagreements to increase both its sustainability and impact.Significant work needs to be done to deepen the technicalcontent of these processes and help them move from politi-cal declarations, to effective support, to action at the coun-try level. Explore and enhance the use of policy lending to enable forest sector governance reforms as discussed in this chapter and associated notes. (For more informationon the application of development policy lending for forestsector reform, see note 6.2, Prospects for Using Policy Lend- ing to Proactively Enable Forest Sector Reforms.) Identify necessary FLEG measures for enabling reduced emissions from avoided deforestation and degra- dation (REDD) while also exploring opportunities to main-stream FLEG considerations into country dialogue onREDD (see box 5.3). NOTES 1. Officials and institutions may be either public or pri- vate, the first of which may be termed public sector forest governance and the latter corporate forest governance. This distinction is useful in developing a typology of reform measures. 2. How might a policy maker assess the state of forest gov- ernance in his or her own country? Systematic and objectivequantitative and qualitative estimates of such activities can help benchmark the state of governance in the sector andidentify critical areas for reform and can contribute to mon-itoring the progress of efforts to improve governance. 3. Analytical and advisory activities refer to activities that involve analytical effort with the intent of influencing clientcountries' policies and programs and comprise formal andinformal studies of critical issues, either at the country levelor for specific sectors (for example, economic and sectorwork, policy notes, and the like). This work has traditionallyunderpinned lending and investment operations. Nonlend-ing technical assistance is the transfer of skills and knowl- CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE 157In response to growing awareness that deforestation and forest degradation are major sources of green-house gas emissions, many countries have expressed an interest in implementing payments for forest protec- tion that achieves carbon storage. A UN FrameworkConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) mecha-nism to establish this is under discussion. The initiativeis known as REDD, for Reduced Emissions from Avoided Deforestation and Degradation. Proponents of REDD see it as a low-cost option for reducing global emissions that could also alleviatepoverty and protect biodiversity. However, while muchdeforestation is a rational response to global and localeconomics and is the result of government planning, a significant proportion has been, and remains, illegaland uncontrolled. Tackling this latter element of defor- estation and establishing basic rule of law in the sectorwill be a critical prerequisite for governments hoping to achieve reduced deforestation or attract private sec- tor investment in REDD projects, particularly in theearly stages of the market. Previous to the REDD concept, establishing legality in the sector has long been a priority for those working in forests, and it is important that synergies are recog-nized, continuity is emphasized, and political processesand tools designed to support improved legality in pro-duction forests are also used in support of REDDstrategies where relevant. Beyond the need to establishlegal control of the forest resource, it will also be nec- essary to tackle systemic issues.Box 5.3 REDD and Forest Governance Source: Saunders and Nussbaum 2008.edge for development purposes and a key instrument for improving policies and project design, enhancing skills, andstrengthening implementation capacity.

Given the right conditions, decentralization of forest man- agement can lead to superior outcomes, improving the effec- tiveness of public forest institutions by matching the demandfor public forest services with their supply by local govern-ments. Decentralized local institutions of the public forestadministration can be closer to local people, their demands, and priorities, and thereby offer opportunities for govern- ment to become more relevant to local conditions. By empha-sizing subnational governmental autonomy, forest decentral-ization can promote democratic decision-making processesand free top executives of the public forest administrationfrom many routine decisions. If decentralization leads togreater local voice and participation, it can contribute togreater accountability and to reducing forest-related corrup-tion and government misuse of forest resources. Local partic-ipation can also induce design of and experimentation withcreative and innovative programs that make use of localknowledge and that are tailored to local settings, moving away from the application of standardized actions designedby the central government. Furthermore, forest decentraliza-tion can help improve equity through greater capture andlocal retention, as well as democratic distribution, of forestmanagement benefits. Because of this, decentralization can beinstrumental in reducing local conflicts over the use of forestresources and the allocation of resulting benefits and costsamong institutions and local people. Thus, decentralizationcan lead to better governance and improved efficiency, equity,and environmental management outcomes. However, there are potential risks associated with decentralization. It is an extremely complex undertakinginvolving multiple levels of government, agencies with different functions, and stakeholders with diverse, some-times incompatible, interests. Authority, responsibility, and financial and human resources as well as a variety of administrative functions can be decentralized to differentdegrees, thus creating countless possible pathways todecentralized forest administration. Decentralized forestinstitutions often cannot function adequately if they are not endowed with sufficient resources and authority.Imbalances in the allocation of authority and responsi-bility to the various levels of government, possiblybecause the process is still incomplete, also make efficientpublic forest service delivery difficult. Regardless of the path to decentralization, inadequate subnational capacity is almost always a limiting factor. Some obstacles to effective forest decentralization have their origins in the drastic changes in power structureswithin the government apparatus that are associated with,and required for, effective decentralization, and that occurduring the redistribution of authority and resources fromthe central government to subnational governments. Gov-ernment officials at the center often resist these realloca-tions of power. Furthermore, when powers are redistrib-uted to subnational levels, decentralization often alsoincreases the possibility of regulatory capture by local interests. Local government officers and politicians can beeven more subject to corruption than those of the centralgovernment. In addition, unless some key functions of government remain at the center, such as defining national forest pol-icy parameters, overall policy coherence in the sector maybe lost. The challenge for forest sector planners is to shapeand manage decentralization processes in a way thatsecures its potential benefits while avoiding associatedpitfalls. Some of the main promises of decentralizationand the corresponding limitations it faces are listed intable 5.2. 159Decentralized Forest ManagementNOTE 5.1OPERATIONAL ASPECTS With decentralization being such a multifaceted process, there is no single \"model\" for forest decentralization. Differ-ent degrees of responsibility and authority can be trans- ferred to one or more subnational units of government, andthe central government may choose to retain a large or lim- ited share of responsibility and authority. The potentialbenefits and disadvantages mentioned above will emerge depending on the functions being decentralized and on the local governance and institutional context. 160 CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE Table 5.2 Forest Decentralization: Potential Advantages and Dangers Potential advantages Potential dangers There may be reduced bureaucracy and decision- making congestion Coordination, implementation, and monitoring of national policies may at the center. be more difficult. Central government may be excessively weakened by the transfer of resources to subnational governments. Unclear division of powers may lead to increased conflicts between tiers of government.

Decision making may be less transparent and less responsive. If local governments do not produce a substantial economic surplus, net transfers from the central government may be lost. There may be a greater sense of local ownership. Local ownership may be lost if benefit sharing becomes less equitable. Decentralized forestry offices may be controlled by special interests.

Political meddling by central powers may be more difficult. Local government officials with greater responsibility and power may use decentralized institutions for their own political and personal purposes. Political meddling by the central government may simply be replaced by local political interference and government capture by organized elites. Decentralization may be a vehicle for central political parties to penetrate the rural and forest economy. Corruption may decrease if the discretionary power of central If centralized monitoring and control are loosened, particularly if government officials is reduced.

Source: Contreras-Hermosilla. 2006.Assess the overall decentralization context. Forest decentralization will generally be part of broader decentral- ization initiatives involving the whole government, which will largely shape what can be done in the forest sector. Government-wide characteristics may impose limits as wellas offer opportunities to decentralization in the forest sec-tor. For example, some decentralized governments, such asthat of Switzerland, have strong locally elected bodies that make local participation and downward accountability oflocal public forest administration to local populations andelectorates easier to achieve. Other governments are notinclined to go this far and their levels of local participationand accountability may be lower. Project designers must evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of public and private sector organizations and their capacity to performthe forest management functions before drawing plans forforest decentralization interventions (see chapter 2, Engag-ing the Private Sector in Forest Sector Development, andnote 2.1, Community-Private Partnerships). Forest decentralization must be adequately linked to overall decentralization processes because of the multidisci-plinary characteristics of forest administration and thenumerous cross-sectoral influences that shape forest gover-nance (see chapter 6, Mainstreaming Forests into Develop-ment Policy and Planning: Assessing Cross-Sectoral Impacts, and associated notes). For example, in Albania, aBank intervention observed that the Forest Administration was unable to control illegal logging except in selected areaswhere it was able to establish operational links with other decentralized agencies. In this case, an interministerial task force of various stakeholders at the national level was com-plemented by the creation at the prefecture and district lev-els of intersectoral task forces to organize collaboration(World Bank 2004). Get the legal framework right. A critical operational consideration to making forest decentralization work is the existence of a clear and consistent legal framework guidingthe distribution of responsibilities, resources, and authorityat the different levels of government and the relationshipsbetween government and local communities and the privatesector (see note 5.3, Strengthening Legal Frameworks in theForest Sector). While this appears to be a self-evident aspectof good governance, experience shows that, in practice, for-est decentralization often takes place in an environment ofconsiderable legal uncertainty (see box 5.3). This legaluncertainty is a sure recipe for conflicts between tiers ofgovernment and government institutions as well as betweenpublic and private entities that defeat the potential gover-nance benefits of decentralization. Legal regimes shouldprovide local people and the private sector with enforceable rights to resources and enable them to play a meaningful NOTE 5.1: DECENTRALIZED FOREST MANAGEMENT 161In 1999 the Indonesian government approved legislation to decentralize government authority, resources, andresponsibilities to provinces (second tier government) and districts (third tier). Districts, considered closer to the people and therefore more apt to promote democra-tization, were assigned primary responsibility for admin-istrative and regulatory functions. However, drafted inhaste, the decentralization laws were inconsistent or even contradictory with other laws. And in the midst of theinstability that dominated the political scene after the fallof Suharto, corresponding operational regulations to thedecentralization laws were slow to come, leaving much tointerpretation and to the discretion of local public offi-cials who were often inadequately prepared. In the same year, the Basic Forestry Law was enacted. This law and its regulations contradicted sig-nificant parts of the decentralization legislation. Adecree issued a year later sought to clarify matters, lim- iting forest sector decentralization to marginal func-tions, and was resisted by some districts. Legal uncer- tainty surrounding the division of powers and responsibilities created a de facto movement towardforest decentralization and intense conflicts betweenthe district governments and the center. In these circumstances, and fearing appropriation or interference by other levels of government, forest resource-rich districts had a powerful incentive toaccelerate resource exploitation, giving only secondaryconsideration to the long-term consequences of unsus-tainable practices. In some cases, legal uncertaintyfavored the creation of local alliances between power- ful groups and government officials. T o a great extent, the poor have yet to reap the benefits expected fromforest decentralization.Box 5.4 Legal Uncertainty in Indonesia Source: Contreras-Hermosilla and Fay 2005; Boccucci and Jurgens 2006.role in decision making related to the management of forest resources. In most countries, the strength of legal frame-works is becoming more important as forest resources become increasingly scarce and thus the focus of conflicts between different stakeholders (Lindsay 2000). General decentralization laws will provide most of the legal framework for the forest institutions of government,which must become aligned with those broader laws. An assessment of the legal frame of reference needed to makeforest decentralization effective may be required. In mostcases, the forest administration alone may be able to handlemany of the desired regulatory changes without resorting toparliamentary sanctioning. Participation, empowerment, and poverty allevia- tion. An important requirement for decentralization processes to succeed and ensure transparency is the abilityof local governments to work with local communities andother private sector and civil society stakeholders. The gov-ernment's underlying political philosophy must allow localparticipation in the formulation of local plans and policiesand the local forest administration must have capacity tomanage these interactions. Government should be fullycommitted to involving local communities and other stake-holders in decisions related to implementation of forest programs. Adequate management of the interactionsbetween local governments, communities, and private sec-tor entities that may participate in joint schemes for themanagement of forest resources requires, in addition tocapacity to handle technical matters, substantial changes toattitudes and institutional incentives. When these capabili-ties are not available, technical assistance to support inten-sive training of government officers, communities, andenterprises will be needed. Participation mechanisms are likely to work better when government institutions and bureaucracy are exposed toincentives that reward participation; this often meansaccountability to local institutions and populations ratherthan exclusively to higher levels of government. In thosecases where decentralization is based on local governmentsrun by officials democratically elected by local constituen-cies, participation and bottom-up approaches to forestmanagement are easier to integrate. But there are othercomplementary mechanisms as well, including joint proj-ects (for example, comanagement schemes), planning advi-sory groups, monitored self-regulation of forest-relatedactivities (particularly relevant for the private commercialsector), citizen appeals processes for government decisions,forest forums involving government and civil society, andmandatory disclosure of forest administration records. Local citizen group participation, as observed in Bolivia,India, and Nepal, has contributed to ensuring that measures imposed by higher levels of government take local condi- tions and traditions into consideration. Participation by communities and local populations in local government decisions and implementation of forestprograms works better when there are clear and tangible benefits associated with such participation for all stakehold-ers. The flow of information between local governmentsand local groups must therefore be adequate to enable par-ticipatory decision making. Adequate balance of responsibilities, powers, and resources at each level of government. T o function effectively and efficiently, each level of government and cor-responding agencies must possess sufficient authority tofulfill the responsibilities allocated to them. While this bal-ance is hard to determine with precision in practice, author-ity without a corresponding measure of responsibility fos-ters mismanagement and creates opportunities forcorruption. In the same vein, responsibility without a mea-sure of power to command resources and implementactions cannot be adequately discharged. At the same time, power and responsibility are meaning- less unless each level of government and each agency can count on adequate financial and human resources. There isno real local autonomy if higher levels of government haveexclusive control over what programs and projects willreceive financial support (see box 5.5). Transfers of financialresources to lower levels of government are normallyneeded to empower local levels of the public forest admin-istration to carry out management activities. In some cases,local autonomy may require retention of forest revenuescaptured by local governments. Apply the principle of subsidiarity. Although there is no formula for deciding what degree of decentralization is opti- mal to ensure good forest governance, certain functions arebest left at the central level and others can best be carried outlocally. Subsidiarity, a fundamental concept behind decen-tralization, establishes that government functions should becarried out at the lowest possible level of government wherecapacity exists or can be readily created. The proper applica-tion of this principle requires an assessment of capacities atdifferent levels of government and of institutions of civilsociety and the private sector that could assume responsibil-ity for various forest management-related functions. Suchassessment is a useful tool for judging the relative desirabil- 162 CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE ity of decentralization options and for helping determine the responsibilities and powers of the various levels of govern-ment, including the central government (Anderson 1999). Ensure transparency and accountability, particularly downward accountability. Closely linked to effective local participation in decision making and implementation of for-est programs is the need to ensure that the actions of local government officers are transparent and that the officersthemselves remain accountable to local populations for theiractions (see box 5.6). The transfer of powers to local institu-tions may have worse outcomes than centralized manage-ment if accountability mechanisms to local populations are weak. When accountability has been mainly or exclusively to higher levels of government, local groups have no avenue tohave their views heard and no power to influence policydesign and program implementation. Local forest institu-tions are at risk of becoming simple extensions of the centralgovernment, which naturally tends to use them for promot-ing central agendas, thus defeating many of the opportunitiesof decentralization (Ribot 1998). Inadequate or nonexistentdownward accountability facilitates control by local elites,often operating in association with local government institu-tions. This is a real danger, particularly when electoral account-ability is weak and where there is a lack of nongovernmental watchdog organizations that can mobilize public opinion. Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Forest decentralization should include adequate measures to improve community participation and to respect indige-nous and traditional rights. In certain circumstances, trans- ferring additional powers to local governments enhancesthe reach of government in areas where government pres- ence was previously absent or weak. If government policy ignores ancestral rights, local community institutions, andcommunity property, enhanced local government power islikely to lead to or exacerbate social inequality. Forest decen-tralization projects should therefore contain adequate mea- sures to avoid potentially adverse effects on Indigenous Peo-ples and other vulnerable communities (see also note 1.3,Indigenous Peoples and Forests, and chapter 12, ApplyingOP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples). Forest and environmental values. Forest decentraliza- tion may generate incentives for accelerated depletion of forest resources and loss of environmental values. Theseincentives are particularly intense if local governments areasked to raise a large proportion of their own financialresources to fund their operations and if rights of access toand control over forest resources by local governments, civilsociety, or the private sector are uncertain (see note 5.4,Strengthening Fiscal Systems in the Forest Sector). LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS Clarity of division of responsibilities and author- ity. Experience acquired in supporting forest decentraliza- tion programs indicates that clarity in the distribution of NOTE 5.1: DECENTRALIZED FOREST MANAGEMENT 163The 1997 Law of Municipalities assigned considerably expanded responsibilities to municipalities, togetherwith greater administrative and political autonomy. However, municipal governments' capacity to dis- charge responsibilities was limited by an imbalancebetween the new obligations and the financialresources allocated to them by the central government. Municipalities were entrusted with developing, con- serving, and controlling the \"rational use of the envi- ronment and natural resources...promoting local ini-tiatives in these areas and contributing to theirmonitoring, vigilance and control...\" (Larson 2001:20). In addition, municipalities were to be consultedbefore central government approval of resource exploitation authorizations in both national and pri-vate lands. Also, municipal governments were to cap- ture at least 25 percent of the revenues originating in these contracts. Despite these formidable responsibilities, munici- palities complained that they did not receive the taxrevenues to which they were entitled. The central gov- ernment on many occasions failed to consult withmunicipalities in awarding exploitation contracts orsimply ignored them. In any case, the central govern-ment kept exclusive power to make key decisions overall natural resources.Box 5.5 Nicaragua: Asymmetries Between Responsibilit ies and Resources and Resistance to Relinquishing Power Source: Larson 2001.responsibilities and commensurate resources and authority are essential for quality decentralized governance. The prob-lems faced by the rapid forest decentralization processes in Indonesia illustrate the importance of achieving a clear dis- tribution of authority and responsibilities for various forestmanagement functions (licensing, forest concessions, classi-fication of forests) between the levels of government andbetween governments and civil society and private sector institutions (Boccucci and Jurgens 2006. Bureaucratic resistance to change. Decentralization in India (Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh), Guatemala (Elias and Wittman 2004), Nicaragua (Larson 2001), andother countries shows that government executives are gen-erally opposed to sharing power and resources with lowerlevels of government. Even when transfer of certain powersis mandated by law, in practice this has meant grantingautonomy to manage only the least significant resources,keeping decisions about the use of the most valuable ones athigher levels. Furthermore, higher levels of governmentcommonly have a tendency to maintain control over finan-cial resources, thus effectively shaping the actions of lowerlevels of government or of local communities and otherinterest groups that require financial backing. This resis- tance to sharing power is one of the most critical threats to effective forest decentralization. In most cases, tackling thisobstacle entails twin efforts aimed at (i) raising awareness ofgovernment officials based on clear and sound intellectualdiscourse and (ii) identification and support of key agentsof change, as in Indonesia. Systems of institutional incen-tives must be geared toward rewarding progress in decen-tralization processes. This can be facilitated by democraticdecision making schemes that enhance downward account-ability of local government officials to local populations.(Resistance to change is also addressed in note 5.2, Reform-ing Forest Institutions). Capacity building. Another lesson of experience is that lack of local capacity is often used as an excuse for reducing the pace of forest decentralization or for recentralizing. However, localcapacity is unlikely to ever be created unless decentralizationtakes place. Thus, implementation of forest decentralizationprograms may require education and training programs forlocal governments and civil society institutions expected to play a role in the decentralized management of forest resources(World Bank 2004). If significant responsibility for forestresource management is transferred to local institutions, as inIndonesia, technical assistance will be required. Planning such assistance will require an institutional analysis of demands andcapacities of the various levels of government and a coherentplan to fill in gaps. Improving the knowledge base and mana-gerial capacity are long-term undertakings that may require sustained support for extended periods. As emphasized by aproject in Nicaragua, World Bank interventions should pilotdecentralization initiatives and be designed as a series of se-quential building blocks as institutional and managerial capac-ity gradually develops over long periods (World Bank 1998).

With respect to forest man- agement, institutional reforms supported by the Bank have sought to take a broad view of the value of forestsfor the production of timber and nontimber products,as well as for biological diversity conservation and water -shed management. Every country has a different scope, pace, and outcome associated with its reform. Reform takes time and is often implemented in a step-wise manner to minimize risks andfrictions among parties. In most cases, reforms are intro-duced within the context of revisions of forest policy, strategies, and legislation. The latter may be catalyzed byfactors outside the sector, including macroeconomic and structural reforms, and should occur in a transparent and participatory manner. The second phase of reform focuseson institutional issues. Considerations in the second phaseinclude the capacity and functions of forest institutions. Atthis stage, as was done in many countries in western Europe, the roles of forest administration and managementmay be separated. Reform processes have covered all the key functions in the forest sector (see box 5.7), including the following:Reforming Forest InstitutionsNOTE 5.2 166When policy makers mandate that forest organizations are to deliver on certain tasks, and when multifunctionalforest management is an explicit objective of policy, for- est organizations (broadly defined) can be expected to have clear functions specific to the following areas: Policy and legislation policy setting legislation and regulation enforcement of the legal framework Forest management services forest management and planning fire and pest management forest inventory forest regeneration management for recreational uses management for conservation management for the provision of environmental services, such as watershed protectionOther services sale of timber and timber products sale of nontimber products marketing services (both timber and nontimberforest products) socioeconomic services to local communities,derived from state-owned forests (fuelwood, non-timber forest products, grazing resources, and so forth) forest extension services to private owners and users These functions can be provided by multiple organizations, both within the public sector (forest departments, commissions, agencies, and state forestenterprises) as well as outside it, by the private sectorand by civil society organizations. In most countries, harvesting, transport, and processing services are pro-vided by the private sector, though often with mixedresults.Box 5.7 Functions of Forest Organizations Source: World Bank 2005.Management of forests (state and nonstate forests) - Forest management operations (silviculture, regener- ation, harvesting, planning, and control) - Sales of timber and nonwood forest products Processing and marketing of timber and nonwood products Public forest administration- Formulation of policy and legislation- Control and enforcement - Development of forest information systems - Education and research- Extension OPERATIONAL ASPECTS Reform processes vary. Specific steps in a reform process will vary, depending on initial conditions. T o initiate reform, all actors need to cooperatively create a basic under- standing of targets and strategy for forest sector manage- ment. This policy should focus on equity, sustainability, bio-diversity, and economics, and should include strategicguidance for the main actors to determine their objectives and operational methods for using the resource in a sus-tainable and cooperative way. The main actors are national and local governments; commercial private sector; communities (including Indigenous Peoples) and small- holders, including cottage industries; civil society; and technical and financial assistance institutions, includingresearch facilities. Post conflict contexts require attention to capac- ity issues. In postconflict countries, the capacity of differ- ent groups to engage in dialogue may need to be strength-ened. This dialogue may need to be facilitated to ensure thatall stakeholders start on a level playing field; thus, the process may need to be adapted accordingly (see box 5.8). The major implementation challenges in reforming for- est institutions include organizing a temporary minimalauthority structure to deal with short-term necessities, NOTE 5.2: REFORMING FOREST INSTITUTIONS 167In April 2004, the U.S. government sent a team to Liberia to initiate discussions with the provisional gov-ernment and civil society representatives, and came to the conclusion that Liberia's forest sector was \"utterly dysfunctional\" (McAlpine, O'Donohue, and Pierson2006) and that the Forest Development Authority(FDA) required a complete overhaul and adequatecapacity and resources. The unique feature of the mul- tidonor effort that followed was that although donorroles were coordinated to avoid duplication and ensurea strategic approach, each donor maintained a highdegree of sovereignty over the allocation of its funds. The Liberia Forest Initiative (LFI) was designed to promote and assist reforms in Liberia's forestry sector to create management transparency and ensure that forest resources are managed in an economically, envi-ronmentally, and socially sustainable way, to the maxi-mum benefit of all Liberians, in accordance withLiberia's national policies and laws, and consistent withits international legal commitments. Although it wasinitiated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2004in response to concerns that proceeds from unsustain-able logging were fueling the ongoing civil war, the LFIquickly came to involve a wide range of governmentaland nongovernmental organizations, aand has come to encapsulate a broad mandate. From the outset, the LFI recognized that thorough and effective reforms would require cross-cutting attention to the \"3 C's\" of forestry in Liberia: the commercial sector, conservation, andcommunity forestry. As a priority focus, however, theLFI identified a few major components as critical tobringing the commercial sector back on line and addressing essential concerns of the UN SecurityCouncil: Financial management and accountability. There was a critical need to restore transparent financial man- agement policies and practices as well as accounta- bility in the forest sector (in particular, to timber products) and to implement transparent and equi-table allocation of resources generated by the forestsector. Institution building. An FDA with the staff, skills, and means (financial and physical) to carry out its mandate needed to be established. Forest allocation policy and practice. There was a need to plan and initiate formal forest use in a balanced,Box 5.8 The Liberia Forest Initiative: Institutional Reform in a Postconflict Country (Box continues on the following page ) 168 CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE transparent manner consistent with official Liberian policy and laws as well as with international obliga-tions, including conservation and extractive uses, that is, sustainable forest management. Legitimacy. Legitimate Liberian authorities needed to be helped to establish control over forest resources. The institutional reforms were part of a broader for- est sector reform process under way in Liberia. Recent achievements of this process include the cancellation ofall concessions, preparation of a Forest Policy, prepara- tion and ratification of a completely revised Forest Law,a vision for a long-term governance structure, and thecreation of the Forest Reform Monitoring Committee. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) took the lead in consulting civil society organizations in develop-ing a public communications strategy, involving work- shops and various media, which proved effective in con- veying the importance of the work of the LFI andgarnering support for measures taken. Meanwhile, theUN Security Council renewed sanctions and passed aresolution that the LFI reform recommendations beadopted. This gave impetus to reform of the concessionsystem, and triggered a multistakeholder review com-mittee involving civil society. Similarly, a Forest ReformMonitoring Committee was also established, with a widespectrum of stakeholders. However, this progress wasstymied by the unwillingness of the provisional govern-ment to implement the committee's recommendations,and in response the donor community developed a Gov- ernance and Economic Management Assistance Plan forstate-owned enterprises, including the FDA, that wouldimpose outside controls and transparency. The election of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as president was a pivotal event. On February 6, 2006, soon after herinauguration, she adopted the recommendations andreforms proposed by the LFI, including the cancella-tion of existing concession permits. With support from the LFI, the FDA started to reduce staff and select key personnel for carrying out high pri-ority tasks, such as organizing and implementing a newconcession and forest management system with the helpof foreign expertise; designing the structure of commu- nity forests; implementing conservation activities; andsetting up the long-term reform process for the FDA, beginning with providing crucial analytical and organi-zational know-how for strategic planning. In addition,financial and technical services required as supportingelements for the reform needed to be identified and quantified. T o initiate these activities and raise knowl-edge and consciousness, three workshops were held oncommunity forestry, forest policy, and institutionalreform. The activities in Liberia are a work in progress faced with enormous political and human resource obsta-cles. The future concept and structure of the FDA, pro-posed in October 2006 (see figure in this box) is gener-ally accepted, but has yet to be finalized. There are many aspects of the LFI model that could be used to create similar change in other countries,including the integration of forest sector reforms intobroader governance and cross-sectoral reforms, the useof a diverse but coordinated partnership of donors,and provision for a strong role for civil society.

Separating administrative and management func- tions. Efforts should be made to eliminate potential con- flicts of interest and to ensure independence, transparency,and neutrality of the public forest administration. This canbe done by removing direct administrative and financiallinks between entities responsible for public functions and state forest management (see box 5.9). Accountability of forest institutions. A mechanism for ensuring accountability of forest institutions should be created, perhaps through the creation of a managementboard that supervises the activities of the entity managingstate forests. The board should include representatives fromdifferent relevant government agencies or ministries, as wellas professionals with qualifications in forestry, environmen- tal conservation, and corporate management. Accountability also requires transparent budget proce- dures and accounting systems that match corporate stan- dards (see box 5.10). These procedures, however, should beachievable and realistic. Change management. A good strategy and structure are not sufficient to guarantee successful reform; it also requires peo- ple to align with the new direction, to bring life into the newstructures, and to commit to strive for new goals. A strategicchange-management approach can be a valuable investmentfor the future of an organization. Change management is a systematic approach to dealing with change from the very beginning of a change program and during all planning andimplementation stages. Change management links the per-spective of the organization with the perspective of the indi-vidual employee. Change management can increase the speedof implementation of a change project and decrease the costs.Effective change management requires that NOTE 5.2: REFORMING FOREST INSTITUTIONS 169In several countries in transition in Europe and Cen- tral Asia, earlier institutional arrangements in theforests sector suffered from conflicts of interest because the same body was both supervising and con- trolling its own operations. T o remove this conflict,the proposed institutional structure separated thesetwo functions. With this arrangement, forest adminis-tration, as part of its enforcement function, supervisesand controls how forests are managed, whether owned by the state (and managed by the state forest enter-prise) or by private forest owners (see box figure). A separate control activity for financial flows should also be maintained or set up, either through an independ-ent government body or accredited private auditors,which typically are used in many Western Europeancountries.Box 5.9 Reducing Conflict of Interest in Forest Management: An Example from Countries in Transition Source: World Bank 2005.Ministry of Agriculture, Environment, or Natural Resources Forest AdministrationAuditorState Forest EnterpriseFinancial controlControl of forest managementBoardSeparation of Supervision and Controlthe transformation process has leadership, top-level management commitment, and broadly based stake-holder participation; implementation is carried out through an independentand influential change team or steering committee; structure follows strategy: careful planning should set thefoundation, but determination and speed are necessaryfor success during implementation; \"quick win\" achievable subtargets are set to help createand maintain momentum; people are actively engaged to build ownership from thevery beginning of the change journey; second- and third-level management, key to success, ade-quately buy in; and communication and information, essential for both inter-nal and external audiences, are professionally prepared. Capacity considerations. Reforms of forest institutions must be linked to building necessary capacity. The manage- ment objectives for service delivery organizations are toprovide forest goods and services for forest industries andfor households while maintaining the forest's ability to pro- vide public goods (such as watershed protection and biodi-versity conservation). Implicit in the idea of forest organi-zations as service delivery institutions is that their servicesare provided to meet the demands of both private and com-munity forest users. Some forest institutions may have thenecessary capacity and simply require redeployment ofthese capacities. In most cases, however, the requisite capac-ity is not available, underscoring the importance of appro-priate training. Assessing success. Measures should be in place to assess the success of institutional reforms. Measurement of success could be based on overall sectoral performance, includingimproved forest management, greater investment and job creation in the industry, stronger financial performance ofboth private and public institutions, better environmentalprotection, improved protected area management, andgreater benefit for civil society. However, even in the best- run forest management organizations, these parameters areseldom assessed in any systematic way. Thus, innovativeapproaches to assessing performance must be introducedthat enable policy makers to determine whether public expenditures are achieving desired outcomes (see box 5.11). 170 CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE Measures proposed for countries in transition in Europe and Central Asia to increase transparentbudget procedures and enhance accounting systems include the following: T o assign the responsibility for controlling forest harvesting and management to state forest adminis-tration. T o determine appropriate funding for state forestmanagement, physical targets for forest manage-ment and environmental conservation should be defined, and necessary investment requirements and operational costs assessed. Funding requirementsmay include ensuring cost efficiency of forest oper-ations by using subcontractors from the private sec-tor when possible; carrying out independent research on efficiency factors; establishing the trans-fer to the state budget based on a residual amountdetermined by deducting estimated costs from totalrevenue (allowing efficiency gains to remain in theorganization as an incentive for improved perfor- mance). Financial auditing through accredited third-party auditors should be arranged. An independent budget for the entity managingstate forests should be established (to assist inincreasing productivity and efficiency in state forest management). The budget should be associated with well-defined obligations toward the statebudget, and development of salary schemes shouldbe based on staff performance to reduce incentivesfor corruption. Marketing of timber and nonwood forest products based on competitive bidding should be arranged toestablish fair, market-based prices; ensure open and equal access to timber and nonwood resources for potential beneficiaries at equitable conditions; andlimit monopolistic features in resource supply.Box 5.10 Measures for Transparent Budget Procedures Source: PROFOR 2003.LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS There are a number of lessons learned that merit attention in the implementation of institutional reforms: The context should define the process of reform. Accord-ingly, it is important to distinguish between situations incountries in economic transition (for example, the Europe and Central Asia region, and China and other parts of Asia); countries recovering from crises (theDemocratic Republic of Congo, Liberia), and countriesresponding to recent developments and having forestsserve multiple functions (Kenya, Tanzania). National forest policy and strategy should be the basis of institutional reforms\u2014not vice versa. Markets can be the best drivers toward sustainable forestmanagement, but reliance on markets can be devastatingif not coupled with necessary safeguards.Sustainable forest management provides an appropriateframework for the assessment of policy options. Impactsshould be quantified and properly evaluated before selecting the most desirable option. Stakeholder participation and transparency are essential in assessing policy options and implementing institu-tional reforms. Experience in large countries like the United States andCanada shows that decentralization in forest administra-tion is an appropriate strategy within an adequate national legal and institutional framework, and that forestry development is best addressed at the local level(see note 5.1, Decentralized Forest Management).Decentralization reforms have to be coupled with strongorganizations at the regional level and effective monitor- ing and control systems to prevent short-term politicaland economic interests from making uncontrolled use offorests and to reduce the potential for elite capture. NOTE 5.2: REFORMING FOREST INSTITUTIONS 171The Citizen Report Card (CRC) is a simple but power- ful tool used to provide public agencies with systematicfeedback from users of public services through sample surveys on service quality to enable public agencies to identify strengths and weaknesses in their work. CRCs provide an empirical, bottom-up assessment of the reach and benefit of specific reform measures.CRCs identify the key constraints that citizens (espe- cially the poor and the underserved) face in accessingpublic services and benchmark the quality and ade-quacy of those services as well as the effectiveness ofthe staff. CRCs aid in generating recommendations onsector policies, program strategy, and management ofservice delivery. Citizen report cards can accomplish the following: Help to convert individual problems facing the var- ious programs into common sector issues. Facilitate prioritization of reforms and correctiveactions by drawing attention to the worst problems,and facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas and approaches by identifying good practices. Provide a benchmark on quality of public services as experienced by the users of those services. Hence,CRCs go beyond the specific problems that individ- ual citizens may face and view each issue from theperspective of other elements of service design and delivery, as well as in comparison with other services,so that a strategic set of actions can be initiated. Suggest that dissatisfaction has causes that may be related to the quality of service (such as reliability ofwater supply), the type of difficulty encountered while dealing with the agency to solve service prob- lems (such as complaints of water supply break-down), and hidden costs in making use of the pub-lic service (such as investments in filters to purifydrinking water). Therefore, CRCs delve into differ- ent aspects of performance to provide indicators ofproblem areas in public services. T est out different options that citizens wish to exer- cise, individually or collectively, to tackle currentproblems (for example, whether citizens are willing to pay more, or be part of a group that has the responsibility for managing public water sources).Hence, CRCs are also a means for exploring alterna-tives for improvements in public services. CRCs have gained credibility because the methodol- ogy involves systematic sampling across all subsections or segments\u2014including those who are satisfied as wellas the aggrieved\u2014and presents a picture that includesall opinions.Box 5.11 Citizen Report Cards: Benchmarking Public Service Delivery Source: Public Affairs Foundation 2004.Where forests are large and diverse, a combination of institutional arrangements for forest management maybe required, including, among others, lease rights, con- cessions, and privatization of forest land. Transaction costs tend to be high in countries where mar- kets do not yet work effectively, corruption is common,risks and business protection costs are high, and other structural issues (uncertainties and frequent changes in taxation and other rules) increase costs to economic oper-ators. High transaction costs significantly reduce the inter-national competitiveness of the forestry sector and impedeprivate investment. Institutional reforms should pay atten- tion to the potential for reducing transaction costs. REFERENCES CITED McAlpine, J. L., P . A. O'Donohue, and O.

CROSS-REFERENCED CHAPTERS AND NOTES Note 5.1: Decentralized Forest Management 172 CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE The law is a powerful tool for shaping forest sector governance. Laws can create institutions anddefine institutional powers and responsibilities. Laws can set the bounds of acceptable behavior and set the punishment for crossing those bounds. Laws can changethe allocation of money among government programs,and shift control over forest resources between central andlocal government and between government and other actors. Laws can define and strengthen property interests.Law can be part of the healing process that follows years ofconflict (see box 5.12). In short, law plays a role in everyforest governance issue (see chapter 5 for a definition ofgovernance). The legal framework applicable to forests has at least two areas that the World Bank may help to strengthen. The first,and most obvious, is the law itself\u2014usually statutes and reg-ulations\u2014and the instruments created to operate under thelaw, for example, contracts. The second is the technicalcapacity to work within the legal system. This includes thelegal knowledge of forest officers and the forest-relatedknowledge of legislators, prosecutors, judges, and otherswho help shape and implement forest laws. It also includesthe capacity of citizens to understand and work under thelaw. Making communities, enterprises, and civil societyeffective users of law and active participants in its develop- ment boosts the rule of law and amplifies the benefits ofimproving the laws. The usual focus of World Bank and donor legal frame- work projects is on the first of these areas, aiming to reformand strengthen the law. In the process, however, the projectsalso can strengthen capacity. For example, compiling anaccurate set of the existing forest law is a first step towardwriting new law, but the compilation process itself can alsostrengthen implementation of the present law. Public vet-ting of drafts of new laws is a way to improve the substanceof reforms. It also gives officials hands-on training in deal-ing with the public, and gives stakeholders practical experi- ence in policy making. Strengthening forest legal frameworks typically requires legal advisers, but the task calls for skills that go beyond knowledge of the law. Lawyers working in concert withforesters, economists, policy experts, government officials,and stakeholders can build frameworks that promote bothsustainable development and the rule of law. OPERATIONAL ASPECTS The ultimate goal of designing legal frameworks is to ensure the creation of responsive structures that arecapable of adapting to changing needs and conditions. Writing a law that works is no easy task, and the stakes are high. A really bad effort can leave the country with alaw that looks impressive but is of little practical use andmay promote cynicism about government and dampencommitment to the rule of law. A really good effort can set the stage for more effective forest administration.More important, it can improve the transparency of for-est governance, motivate under-represented stakeholdersto get involved in forest policy, and encourage respect forthe law. Working with the law Writing forest laws. A good way to start is to consult two recent references on writing forest law. One, from the World Bank in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Orga- nization (FAO), is Forest Law and Sustainable Development: Addressing Contemporary Challenges Through Legal Reform (Christy, Di Leva, and Lindsay 2007). It is a comprehensivemonograph on drafting forest law, with practical knowledgefrom experienced forest law drafters. Annex 5.3A to this note contains an outline of the monograph's contents that 173Strengthening Legal Frameworks in the Forest SectorNOTE 5.3can serve as a checklist of topics for the drafter to consider. The other reference, from the Development Law Office ofFAO, is a paper listing six basic principles for forest law assistance projects (Lindsay, Mekouar, and Christy 2002). Annex 5.3B to this note contains a list from that paper of sixprinciples for effective forest law. The ideas offered herelargely come from those two sources. Another important first step is to consider the dynamics of working with the lawyers and within a legal paradigm (see box 5.13). Another challenge is to eliminate unnecessary regulation and circumscribe the discretion of forest officials. The motivegoes both to improving governance and to reducing con- straints on forest use. Layers of regulation and large amounts of official discretion create opportunities for waste and corrup-tion. The ideal level of regulation conserves the resource whileallowing people broad opportunities to enjoy resource benefits. Limiting power exertions. A further step toward good governance is to create checks on power exertion. These may include increased transparency, so that the press and public opin- ion can have a stronger influence on forest management; watchdog institutional structures, such as advisoryboards, ombudsmen, or inspectors general; allowing citizen or community access to the courts toenforce rules or collect payments due the government; procedural steps, such as environmental impact assess-ments, that require the government to make a reasonedreview of alternatives before taking action; and substantive standards in the laws to limit agency discretion. Practical reforms. Finally, the legal adviser routinely faces the problem of making reforms practical. A system that is too elaborate risks overtaxing the technical capacityof a country and tying the forests down in lengthy proce-dures. The results may be frequent government shortcuttingof the laws and resulting loss of the rule of law. Alternatively, the government could try to live by the letter of the law andend up mired in process, leading people to seek access to theforest through illegal means (see note 5.5, Addressing IllegalLogging). Practicality may demand simpler requirements or 174 CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE The World Bank has supported modernization of for- est law frameworks in several postconflict countries,including Cambodia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The task is sensitive because armed factions can, and do, divert forest income to support conflict. For example, in Cambodia during the early 1990s, theKhmer Rouge financed themselves through timber exports. In Liberia, the sale of timber and diamonds tofuel war was so notorious that the United Nations Gen-eral Assembly placed sanctions on exports until thegovernment could put appropriate financial controlsin place (see box 5.8 in particular). The task is challenging because it involves social as well as legal change. People who have known war andauthoritarianism must embrace new ways to settleconflicts over resource use. There are three broad avenues for settling conflicts: resort to power, as is typified in war; resort to rights, asis typified in litigation; and resort to interests, as is typ-ified in voluntary negotiation. In most conflicts, power,rights, and interests all play some role. But in war-torncountries, rights and interests have taken a backseat topower.Part of the healing process involves reviving the roles of rights and interests. This means promoting the rule of law, to allow people to appeal to the govern- ment to defend their rights, and it means promoting transparent and participatory government, to allowpeople to freely and fairly advocate their interests. In Liberia, for example, the World Bank continues to be part of the LFI, which is assisting the government in forest sector reform. LFI supported the government'sopen review and resulting cancellation of existing forestconcessions. Now the LFI is supporting governmentefforts to establish a chain-of-custody system for forestproducts. The system will track timber from harvest toexport dock, to ensure the government collects all appropriate revenues. The LFI is also supporting devel- opment of a transparent planning system to allocatepublic forests among conservation, commercial, andcommunity uses. A multistakeholder Forest ReformMonitoring Committee is vetting all reforms. The legalwork includes drafting an amendment to the nationalforest law and regulations to support the chain-of-cus-tody and land-use allocation systems, a new model for-est concessions contract, and a model contract for com-munity benefit sharing.Box 5.12 Reforming Forest Law in Postconflict Countries Source: Rosenbaum 2006.NOTE 5.3: STRENGTHENING LEGAL FRAMEWORKS IN THE FOREST SECTOR 175T eam leaders unaccustomed to working on laws with lawyers may wonder what to expect. Here are a few notesbased on project experience. Legal projects often require more than one lawyer because projects cross legal disciplines. A national consult-ant typically supplies essential knowledge of the existingnational legal framework, while an international consult- ant brings knowledge of other areas, such as international standards, approaches to forest law reform, or legislative drafting. Plan to give the lawyers some time to build working rela- tionships with each other and with the team. The interna-tional consultant will need to learn about the existingnational legal framework. The national consultant may need to learn about forest law. Both will need to gain a full grasp of the local forest context and the policy that the team isadvocating that the government adopt. Some team leaders worry whether lawyers will work well with technical advisers. Usually this is not a problem.The lawyer's role in society is to bridge people and the law,and to do that, the lawyer must be able to work with oth-ers on their own terms. Still, technical advisers may find the process of legal reform to be novel and challenging. Just as writing a tech-nical paper requires the writer to come to terms with theexact ideas that the writer wants to convey, writing a lawrequires the policy maker to come to terms with exactly what the policy means. Writing a law demands detailed consideration of practicalities and processes that might beglossed over in discussing the broader outlines of a policy. Also, the law may require technical advisers to learn new terms and use old terms in new ways. A commonexample is the word \"forest.\" T o the forester, this maymean land bearing or capable of bearing tree cover.Strangely, the scientific definition may have little utility inthe law, which might define forests in terms of land thatthe government has reserved or has placed in a particularclass in a cadastral survey. In the end, these definitions arejust tools for the accomplishment of particular tasks, andeach task calls for the appropriate tool. The task of scien-tific forest management calls for the science-based defini-tion, whereas efficient governance calls for the adminis-tratively derived definition. T echnical advisers may find legal language complex or awkward. At times, a legal drafter will sacrifice clarity inpursuit of precision. A good lawyer, with enough time, canbe simple, clear, and precise. A lawyer faced with deadlines,or one who needs to follow old, complex phrasing to ensure that the local courts will interpret the new wordslike the old, may fall short of the ideal. Lawyers can be par- ticular about language\u2014words are their stock and trade. During training and practice, a lawyer encounters dozens or even hundreds of examples of inadvisably chosen wordsleading to legal disputes. Do not be surprised if a lawyer heavily edits any nonlawyer's attempts at legal drafting or if the lawyer suggests to others that they simply explain the policy more fully and leave the legal drafting to thelawyers. Finally, some scientifically trained advisers are taken aback by the way lawyers think: A scientist is trained to look for truth, derived from objective facts. A lawyer is trained to advocate for whatis good, often influenced by subjective values. Any practical adviser knows that good policy requires con- sideration of both facts and values. But the lawyer's focus on what is good can sometimes make the lawyerseem callous to the facts, just as a scientist's focus on what is true can sometimes make the scientist seem callous to human values. A scientist is taught to see the world through a lens of logic: induction and deduction. A lawyer is taughtlogic but also learns that law grows out of history: from precedent, politics, and practical experience. In fact, to the law, sometimes \"a page of history is worth a volume of logic.\" a A scientist is taught to look for the mean: the averageor expected. A lawyer is taught to think about the out-liers: the criminal in society, the loophole in the law, the rare contingency that the law must anticipate, a precedent that might be set. A scientist sees proof as a matter of statistics. That which, 19 times out of 20, cannot be the result ofchance alone is considered a significant event. A lawyer sees proof as a function of legal context. Some things may be presumed true before knowing any facts; some may be taken as true if they are more likely than not;some may only be considered true if they cannot rea- sonably be considered false. These disciplinary differences are usually not as daunting as the cultural differences that project teams must bridge. As with cultural differences, the key is to be aware of your ownpractices and to be open to the practices of others.Box 5.13 Working on the Law with Lawyers Source: Rosenbaum 2006. a.

Eisner , 256 U.S. 345, 345 (1921).requirements that phase in over time, so that the govern- ment and forest users have the opportunity to adapt to thenew regulatory system. Improving capacity and law through good process The process of reforming the law often gives the World Bankopportunities to address the other avenue of strengtheninglegal frameworks: increasing the legal capacity of govern- ment and stakeholders. These activities can be synergistic. Compiling existing forest laws. A first step in legal reform is to compile the texts of the existing forest laws and, often, also property, administrative, criminal, and other general laws that affect forest management. In some coun-tries, no one will have seen such a collection before. The for-est laws may have been amended many times over the years,but no one may have published a version with all theamendments. The government may have produced many forest regulations but never have organized them into a sin- gle collection. The officials in the field charged with imple-menting and enforcing the law may have little idea what itlooks like, and the forest-dependent people affected by thelaw may have no easy way to know what the law is. Understand legal context and legal practice linked to forests. A second step is to investigate the legal context of the country and the legal practices associated with theforests. This may expose any number of legal capacityissues, directly or indirectly linked to reform of the law. Forexample, forest officers may lack an understanding of basic policing skills and may not be properly preserving evidenceof unlawful activities. Prosecutors and judges may lack abasic understanding of forest issues and may not be givingproper weight to the suppression of forest crimes. Landrecords may be incomplete or nonexistent, making it diffi-cult to determine tenure rights. A law reform project is sel-dom tasked with addressing problems like these, but it canflag them for other projects and donors to address. The most important capacity-building effort of a law reform project is typically also the most important step inimproving the substance of the law: vetting proposals for thenew law with government officials and local stakeholders. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS The forest legal framework must be responsive to change. History teaches that the social demands on the for-est are slowly but constantly changing, and no one can pos- sibly anticipate all the situations that will come before thelaw. It follows that for the legal framework to function, itmust have flexibility. Incentives and feedback mechanisms. Experience has demonstrated that the best legal systems achieve their goals through structures that contain incentive and feedbackmechanisms. The hallmarks of those systems are trans-parency, accountability, and public participation. The trueart of legal reform is to create a framework that is consistentwith social change but that also drives institutions tochange, striving for better governance of the forest. Reflecting current values is important. Forest law reform efforts typically share some common challenges. One is incorporating modern values into forest laws.Forestry as a profession has long embraced sustainability,but notions of what resources the forester must conservehave changed as society's knowledge and interests havechanged. Now society may be as interested in biodiversityconservation and carbon sequestration as in fuel and fiberproduction, and ideally governments want their laws to reflect current values. Values determine not only what resources the forester should conserve but who should have access to thoseresources. The present trend is greater recognition ofindigenous, aboriginal, traditional, and community uses,which centralized forest management agencies have oftenmarginalized. Writing modern standards that can coexistwith uncodified traditional rights and expectations can bedifficult. The drafter is often tempted to focus on commer-cial, large-scale forest use, but slighting traditional uses canpromote conflict and disrupt forest-dependent communi-ties. A project that hopes to combat poverty and promotethe welfare of rural forest communities must consider theirexpectations and rights, including the particular rights ofIndigenous Peoples (see note 1.3, Indigenous Peoples andForests). Involve stakeholders. Involving the public almost always strengthens the legal framework. Reviewers with multiple interests and perspectives shed new light on problems,exposing issues that a drafter listening only to governmentforesters might miss. Involvement also gives the public asense of ownership of the law. A group that participates in the democratic process of lawmaking is more likely torespect the law than a group that has the law imposed uponthem without consultation. 176 CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE In addition, the process of public vetting builds capac- ity, both in the government and among stakeholders. Leg- islators and other elected officials bolster their knowledge of forest policy. Forest administrators, who often carry responsibility within the government for producing thefirst formal drafts of the law, learn how to tap stakeholderinput. Being able to conduct a meeting where citizens feelrespected and heard is a surprisingly rare skill. The techni- cal skills of foresters often outweigh their social skills, butforest administrators have to master the social and politi-cal demands of public outreach. For their part, citizens,businesses, and civil society organizations must learn howto be effective participants, and like the government offi- cials, they must learn to listen and not just make speeches. In the best of circumstances, all sides build trust, forgelines of communication, and learn patterns of dispute res-olution that will continue to serve them for years after thenew law is enacted, while the government implements thelaw (see box 5.12 for more about conflict and legalreform).

Principle 2: Avoid unnecessary, superfluous, or cumbersome licensing and approval requirements These can stifle private sector forest use. Do not create these without good cause. Principle 3: Include provisions that enhance the transparency and accountability of forest decision-making processes A broad range of mechanisms are available to accomplish transparency and accountability, including specific limitson the exercise of government discretion, requirements to seek public comment on plans and decisions, access to information rules, oversight bodies, and citizen access tothe courts. Principle 4: Enhance the stake of local nongovernment actors in the sustainablemanagement of forests The trend around the world is toward more local control of forest resources. The law can guarantee local actors securerights while also granting them some flexibility in how they exercise those rights. Principle 5: The drafting of law needs to be a broadly participatory process Public participation improves the substance of law, and the process helps build support for law. Principle 6: Increase the effectiveness of direct law enforcement mechanisms set forth in forestrylegislation Reformers should pay attention to both the penalties and the processes of law enforcement. NOTE 5.3: STRENGTHENING LEGAL FRAMEWORKS IN THE FOREST SECTOR 179ANNEX 5.3B SIX DRAFTING PRINCIPLES FOR CREATING BETTER FOREST LAWS From Lindsay, Mekouar, and Christy (2002). Fiscal instruments encompass a wide range of mech- anisms by which money flows between public andprivate sector institutions involved in the forestry sector. Flows from the private sector to the public sector (forest charges) can be broadly categorized as taxes, royal-ties, fees, and fines. Financial flows in the other direction(incentives) include tax incentives, grants, subsidies, andsubsidized loans. Other fiscal instruments include tempo- rary measures (such as performance bonds) and directintervention by the state (for example, joint ventures, pub-lic shareholding, state marketing boards, and price restric-tions). All of these instruments have different strengths andweaknesses (see box 5.14) and deciding on the right mix of instruments depends on the objectives that the forestry pol-icy maker wishes to achieve. The main objectives of fiscal instruments in the forestry sector are the same as in other parts of government. The two most important are to raise money for the state and tocover the costs of forest administration. In addition, a dis-tinction should be made between raising revenue from the use of the forest resource (royalties) and general revenuecollection (taxes). Fiscal instruments (charges and incentives) can also be used as tools for policy implementation, either to promoteStrengthening Fiscal Systems in the Forestry SectorNOTE 5.4 180Fiscal systems in the forestry sector generally suffer from three similar problems: Inadequate rent capture. Charges for the harvesting of publicly owned forest resources often do not capture the full commercial value of the harvested products.Charges are often set administratively and are notupdated frequently, so they rarely reflect true marketvalues. The main consequence is that these artificially low prices distort markets, discourage efficient use ofthe resource, and result in lost revenues to the state.Inadequate charges may also encourage corruption, ifgovernment officials can capture some of the uncol-lected rent for themselves during the process of moni-toring, controlling, and approving forestry activities. Complexity. Fiscal systems in the forestry sector are often complicated, as a result of administrativeprocesses (setting and collecting forest charges, forinstance) that attempt to replicate market forces by theuse of detailed schedules of charges according to prod- uct type, tree species, forest location, and total area ofproduction. The main consequence is that such sys- tems are often expensive to administer and administra- tion costs can account for a high proportion of totalrevenue collected. Complexity may also present moreopportunities for corruption. Perverse or unintended effects. Fiscal systems also often have unintended effects, particularly with respect to environmental and social aspects of forestmanagement. Incorrect pricing often leads to poorharvesting practices (for example, selective harvestingrather than harvesting of all commercial trees, thusleaving large amounts of roundwood as waste in the forest). Fiscal systems are also sometimes inequitable, especially where harvesting activities impose costs onpeople living in and around forests but provide themfew benefits.Box 5.14 Common Problems with Fiscal Systems in the Forestry Sector Source: Whiteman 2006.forestry policy or to promote other government policies. Forestry policy objectives largely center on sustainable for-est management (that is, the promotion of good forest prac- tices and deterrence of bad practices). Broader policy objec- tives can include income redistribution, correction ofexternalities (nonmarket costs and benefits), strengtheningof legal compliance, and encouragement of economic devel-opment (for example, through the creation of income, employment, and value added). Three other issues should also be considered in the design of any system of fiscal instruments: Economic efficiency. Fiscal instruments often result in market distortions (they alter the costs and prices of inputs and outputs in the sector). These should be mini- mized wherever possible, unless introduction of such distortions is a specific policy objective. Administrative efficiency. The public costs of enforcement and the private costs of compliance with the fiscal policy should be appraised and minimized wherever possible. Equity. The impact of fiscal instruments on different income groups should be considered. All groups shouldface the same set of charges and incentives, unless income redistribution is an objective of the fiscal policy (to assist with poverty reduction, for instance) (see box 5.15).OPERATIONAL ASPECTS Technical and policy considerations can shape fis- cal instruments. Fiscal instruments employed in the forestry sector encompass a wide range of different types of forest charges (see annex 5.4A to this note) and incentives. Operational aspects of the design of fiscal systems in theforestry sector fall into two broad categories. The firstincludes technical considerations, such as setting the correctlevel of charges and incentives and designing a system that is efficient and equitable. The second includes policy-relatedconsiderations: Does the system promote good forest man-agement, good governance, and poverty alleviation? Box5.16 presents a brief summary of some of these issues,which are further elaborated upon in this note. Setting forest charges correctly. T o ensure that forest charges are economically efficient and do not introduce unin- tended distortions in the markets for forest products, the cor-rect levels of forest charges must be established. Becausecharges for services and materials (fees) should reflect theircosts, and general taxes are largely outside the control offorestry administrations, the main concern of forestryadministrations is usually to establish the correct level of roy-alty payments (that is, payments for the use of the resource). NOTE 5.4: STRENGTHENING FISCAL SYSTEMS IN THE FORESTRY SECTOR 181Most natural forest resources in Fiji are owned by local communities (native landowners), but monitoring andcontrol of forest harvesting is performed by the Forestry Department. The Forestry Department, along with the Native Land Trust Board, assesses and collectsa variety of royalties and fees. Some of this revenue isretained by the two organizations to cover their admin-istrative costs, but the majority of the revenue collected is distributed to individuals in local communitieswhere harvesting has occurred. T o gain access to forest resources, forest operators have to obtain a license from the Forestry Departmentand (at least informal) approval from local communi-ties where they wish to harvest. As part of the negotia- tions with local communities, it has become common practice for potential license holders to offer additionalbenefits (monetary or in kind, known as \"commis-sions\" or \"goodwill\") to communities where the har-vesting will occur. Because of the infrequent revision ofroyalty rates, these additional payments can be almost as much as the revenue collected through the royaltysystem. Analysis of the total amount of revenue collection has shown that almost all the rent from forest opera- tions is collected and that about 85 percent of this ispaid to local communities (with the remainderretained equally between the Forestry Department, the Native Land Trust Board, and the forest operator). Thishigh level of rent collection is no doubt due to the pres-ence of the informal market mechanism on top of theofficial forest revenue system. The success of this system is due to the following factors: a high level of competition for the resource; well-informed communities with a long tradition of community rights; a strong legal framework and insti-tutions to support local communities; and the creationof an established norm to make informal payments ontop of official royalties and fees.Box 5.15 Informal Competition for Harvesting Rights in Fiji Source: Whiteman 2005.In theory, the royalty payment for roundwood harvested from the forest should equal the price that would be paid for standing trees (stumpage value) if they were sold in a com- petitive market. This price can be calculated as the value of the roundwood at the port or processing plant (determinedby species, quality, product prices, and the efficiency of pro-cessing plants), less the costs of harvesting, extraction, andtransport (determined by the efficiency of the producer and location-specific factors, such as terrain, forest stocking, andtransport distance). Royalty payments can be established through competi- tive means, such as competitive bidding in auctions or ten-ders, or they can be set by the forestry administration. In the latter case, consultation, negotiation, or calculation of the stumpage value (as described above), can be used to set thepayment. Because of the effort involved, infrequent revaluation of royalties is a major problem in many countries, althoughsome countries regularly alter royalties according to prede-termined formulae (for example, taking into account priceindexes for the main operational costs and forest productprices). Another difficulty with setting royalties administra-tively is obtaining reliable information about costs andprices for the calculation of stumpage values. In addition,information about forest stocking is sometimes needed to calculate appropriate royalties (especially where royaltieswill be collected using area-based charges).Traditionally, competitive mechanisms have mostly been used to establish royalties for relatively small, short-term sales of standing trees (especially from forest plantations). Royalties on production from longer, large-scale forest con- cessions have more commonly been established usingadministrative means. However, it is possible to combineboth methods for forest concessions by, for example, settingvolume- and area-based charges according to a predeter- mined formula and using a bidding process to set a licensecharge (World Bank 2003). Fiscal incentives. Fiscal incentives are a subset of a broad range of measures that encourage others to act (FAO 2004). Incentives are most commonly used to promote activitiesthat result in net nonmarket benefits (that is, production ofgoods and services, usually social and environmental, thathave no value in the marketplace and are not, therefore, asource of revenue for the forest owner). In many countries,incentives are used to promote tree planting and afforesta-tion in general, with a broad assumption that these actionswill usually lead to net nonmarket benefits. However, withthe development of payments for environmental services(PES) and funding mechanisms to support internationalconventions, incentives are gradually becoming more accu-rately targeted toward specific activities that result in specific nonmarket benefits (for further details, see note 2.3, Innova-tive Marketing Arrangements for Environmental Services). 182 CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE A brief, simple summary of some remedies to the problems raised in box 5.14 include the following: Market mechanisms. Greater use of market mecha- nisms (competitive tendering and bidding) can reduce some of the problems of complexity and inadequaterent capture in fiscal systems by using the market toestablish the true value of the resource. Improved data and information. Increasing the relia- bility of and access to information about the forest resource and markets supports the greater use of mar-ket mechanisms. Public reporting of production, rev-enue collection, and the results of monitoring and con-trol activities can also reduce the scope for corruption. Greater consultation. Providing opportunities for all stakeholders to comment on fiscal policies should leadto better outcomes. Public input can include discussionof both technical and policy-related issues and should examine who gains and who loses from existing andproposed arrangements. Reforms of fiscal systems in the forestry sector are frequently opposed by vested interests and their influence may be reduced withgreater consultation and open discussion and debateabout who will lose and who will benefit from reform. Decentralization. Forestry activities are often criti- cized for imposing costs on local people without pro- viding them any benefits. If carefully designed\u2014takinginto account the capacity of local institutions\u2014fiscalsystems can share the benefits of forestry with localpeople, compensating them for any costs they mayincur and encouraging them to participate in the man- agement and protection of forests (see note 5.1, Decen- tralized Forest Management).Box 5.16 Solutions to Problems with Fiscal Systems in the Forestry Sector Source: Whiteman 2006.The most common fiscal incentives in the forestry sector are reductions in forest charges (for example, provision of materials or services by the forestry administration at low cost or reductions in taxes and forest charges if operators build processing facilities). Other incentives include directtransfers from the public to the private sector if operatorsundertake certain activities (grants or subsidized loans forafforestation, training, or forest industry development, for instance). As with forest charges, effectiveness, efficiency,and equity are important issues that should be addressed aspart of the design of any forestry incentive scheme. Targeting incentive schemes. With respect to effective- ness, incentive schemes should be properly targeted toward both the objectives that it sets out to achieve and the indi-viduals or institutions that it aims to influence. In thisrespect, it is generally better to offer direct transfers to sup-port specific activities in the forestry sector rather than toreduce forest charges as an incentive. Targeting and establishing the correct level of incentives are also important to achieving economic efficiency. Incen-tives should only be offered to support activities that resultin net nonmarket benefits and the efficient level of incen-tives will be that which reflects the level of those benefits (asopposed to the cost of the relevant activities). Common problems in this area include the following: Overpayment of incentives. Overpayment occurs where a flat-rate subsidy or grant payment is used to encourage an activity. Inevitably, some recipients of such payments will receive more than would be necessary to make them undertake these activities. The difference between what ispaid and what would be required is sometimes referredto as the deadweight of the incentive. This can be mini-mized by using competitive tendering for specific activi- ties rather than flat-rate grant schemes. Non-additionality. This is an extreme form of dead- weight, where recipients are paid to do something that they would have done anyway (without any incentive). This often occurs where an incentive is given to do some- thing that is already required by law (for example, fiscalincentives to promote industry development where con-cessionaires are already required to build processingfacilities as part of their concession agreements). Displacement. Displacement occurs when an incentive results in a change in behavior but little or no increase in the total amount of the desired activity. It is often associated with location-specific incentives, such as grants for tree planting that result in changes in thelocation of tree planting but little increase in total tree planting. The issues just mentioned are starting to gain the atten- tion of policy makers (for example, in the rules and proce- dures for investments for credits under the Kyoto Protocol)and again, direct transfers (as opposed to forest chargereductions) are likely to offer a better opportunity toimprove targeting and efficiency. Political considerations. Fiscal policies in the forestry sector have a huge impact on the success of forestry policy. In addition, the administration of fiscal instruments oftenaccounts for a significant proportion of the forestry admin-istration's functions. Consequently, it is essential that fiscalpolicies support policy objectives and are administrativelyfeasible. Political consensus and broad stakeholder support must be built for fiscal policies in the forestry sector to be suc-cessfully reformed. An approach to revenue collection based on a social contract between government and the public,rather than coercion, is likely to be more sustainable in thelong run. Consultation, transparency, and public disclosureof information during the establishment and collection offorest charges is likely to build support for the process andreduce the possibility for vested interests to block reforms.Coordination with policy makers in other parts of govern-ment should also assist in this respect. Administrative considerations. Administration of fiscal instruments should be based on a stable framework, sup- ported by legislation, that establishes the basic principlesand procedures for forest charges and incentives but, at thesame time, allows the forestry administration the flexibilityto revise the instruments when required (in response tochanging market conditions, for instance). The infrequencyof revisions to forest charges is often a result of the require-ment that the changes only happen through legislation. Thus, it is better to use primary legislation to establish themechanisms and procedures that will be used to set forestcharges, with appropriate mechanisms for regular reviews,oversight, and consultation. In practical terms, fiscal instruments should be simple to administer and easy to enforce, and should minimize the need for discretion or judgment by forestry administrationstaff. A simple forest revenue system that can be easilyenforced will be better than a more complicated system that is easy to evade. Where evasion is high, the partial enforce-ment of revenue collection can have a significantly detri- NOTE 5.4: STRENGTHENING FISCAL SYSTEMS IN THE FORESTRY SECTOR 183mental impact on the equity of the forest revenue system and is likely to result in little public support for the forestryadministration. Poverty alleviation considerations. Because poverty alleviation is a major national priority in most developing countries, forestry policy (including fiscal systems in theforestry sector) should be designed with this in mind (see chapter 1, Forests for Poverty Reduction, and associatednotes). Subsidies and other fiscal policies for nonforestactivities can distort the incentive structure for community-based forest management. Government policies regardingrevenue from taxes and fees on forest products and conces- sions can also undermine indigenous communities' inter- ests in and claims on forest resources. T o make fiscal systems more advantageous to poor peo- ple, decision makers should gather and analyze informationon the impacts of various policy and management optionson the livelihoods of people living in and around the forest,for example, the ways in which commercial forest harvesting affects the availability of wildlife, nonwood forest products, andother forest services used by local people; the effect of protected areas or bans on hunting and col-lection of nonwood forest products on local livelihoods; the value of fuelwood and nonwood forest products lostif a degraded forest area were to be converted to plantedforest; or the beneficiaries of financial incentives with regard toplanted forest development. Nonfinancial considerations: In addition to the finan- cial costs and benefits to forest owners and other stakehold- ers, nonfinancial aspects must also be considered. Many ofthese are local and can be detrimental to poor people,including degradation of soil and water resources, loss of access, and degradation or loss of forests that have culturalor spiritual value. Fiscal systems that appear to be fair to stakeholders at the national level may have negative effects on poor com-munities if those communities bear the burden of some costs, but do not share the benefits of forest management. Thus, fiscal systems can attempt to compensate for some ofthese effects through revenue- or benefit-sharing arrange-ments (see below) or can be combined with incentives tosupport local participation in forest management or regu-lations to minimize the negative impacts of forest manage-ment on communities.Revenue sharing. A recent trend in many countries is the development of revenue sharing or revenue retention mech- anisms, or both. Revenue sharing occurs when part or all ofthe public revenue from forest operations is shared withindividuals or local levels of government (usually in loca- tions where production occurs). Revenue retention occurswhere the forestry administration keeps some or all of therevenue collected and uses it to fund their operations. The earmarking or hypothecation of government rev- enue is generally not recommended because it goes againstthe principle of good public financing that public revenueshould be collected according to ability to pay and disbursedaccording to need. However, revenue sharing is often pro-posed as a mechanism to generate local support for forestprotection and use. Revenue sharing and revenue retentionare also suggested in situations where disbursement of pub-lic funds is slow and unpredictable. Although the use of revenue sharing should generally be minimized, the above arguments may sometimes be valid. Ifso, the following should be considered: Governance and administrative capability. Any decision to automatically share revenue with lower levels of govern- ment (or communities) should consider whether the scheme will result in the desired effect. Lower levels of government are likely to have less capability to managefunds and, in particular, may be less qualified to properlyassess and collect forest charges. In addition, it shouldnot be automatically assumed that lower levels of gov- ernment are more responsive to local people's needs (seenote 5.1, Decentralized Forest Management). Property rights. In some countries, forest resources are managed by the government on behalf of local people (for example, where local communities own the land under forests or own the forests entirely). In such cases, revenue sharing is appropriate and the amount of rev-enue shared with local people should be determined onthe basis of the value of their property rights. Community forest management. In some countries, com- plete (or nearly complete) control over forest manage- ment has been delegated to local communities. In such circumstances, the role of the forestry administration should be as a facilitator, to ensure that best practices inrevenue collection are followed and to build capacity inlocal governance and administrative capability (see note1.2, Community-Based Forest Management). Forest administrations as service providers. If the forestry administration is providing a good or service, it is per- forming the function of a state-owned enterprise and it 184 CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE is reasonable to allow the administration to retain the revenue from charges it collects from such activities.Similarly, it is acceptable for forestry administrations to retain some revenue to cover the costs of administering the forest revenue system, when the costs of doing so canbe clearly identified and quantified. Revenue sharing is not a panacea for problems of weak governance and administration in the forestry sector at the national level. As with other aspects of fiscal policy in theforestry sector, any decision to implement revenue sharingshould be based on a robust appraisal of what the problemsare and how revenue sharing might address these problems. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS Based on the lessons learned from countries' experiences with fiscal instruments, the following are recommendationsfor best practice in this area. Policy and administration Fiscal policies in the forestry sector should supportforestry policy objectives and the broader objectives ofgovernment. Negative impacts on efficiency and equity should be minimized. Fiscal policy reform requires political support and some degree of consensus and should not be viewed as a purelytechnical issue. Open debate and transparency in the procedures for revising and implementing fiscal policy are necessary to build this support. Administration of fiscal instruments should be as simple as possible and calculation of forest charges should bebased on objective criteria. The need for discretion or judgment by field staff responsible for assessing and col- lecting charges should be minimized. The general framework for fiscal policies should be estab- lished in primary legislation, but forestry administrationsshould be empowered to revise the details of implementa- tion. Automatic and regular reviews of fiscal instruments should be implemented according to clearly defined, rig-orous, and objective processes and procedures. Defining the mixture and level of fiscal instruments Wherever possible, market mechanisms should be used to establish the levels of charges and incentives ratherthan administrative means.When charges and incentives are set administratively, theyshould be based on a rigorous and objective calculation ofcosts and benefits. In particular, forest charges should be based on independent or aggregate information about forest product prices, and charges levied on individualoperators should not be based on stated prices. Incentivesshould be based on the benefits of activities that are beingencouraged rather than their cost. Incentives should be used to achieve clearly defined policy objectives; they should be properly targeted andregularly evaluated. Incentives in the form of direct transfers will generally be more successful than reduc- tions in forest charges. Incentives should also be struc-tured to maximize net benefit and minimize deadweight,nonadditionality, and displacement. There is a tradeoff between administrative efficiency and economic efficiency in fiscal instruments. More compli-cated instruments tend to be more economically efficient but more expensive to administer. Numerous charges should be avoided (especially where they are levied onthe same item). However, in general, a mixture of differ-ent types of charges may be optimal. Thus, countriesshould not rely on volume-based charges alone, but should consider greater use of area-based charges andlicense charges. Revenue sharing In general, hypothecation of forest revenue is not good practice in public finance and should be avoided. How-ever, under some specific circumstances it can be justi- fied. The first is where local people or communities have clearly defined property rights over some or part of theforest resource. The second is where the forestry admin-istration is collecting charges to recoup costs for the pro-vision of a good or service (which can include the cost of administering the forest revenue system). In such cases,revenue sharing should be based on an objectiveappraisal of the amount of revenue that should be sharedor retained. Little evidence supports the hypothesis that revenue sharing alone will result in improved forest protection bylocal communities. In situations where conflict with local communities is an issue, it may be preferable to devolve complete responsibility for forest management (includ-ing revenue collection) to local communities. In suchcases, the forestry administration's role becomes that of aservice provider, to ensure that best practices in revenue collection and administration are followed. NOTE 5.4: STRENGTHENING FISCAL SYSTEMS IN THE FORESTRY SECTOR 185Any proposal to implement revenue sharing should con- sider local governance and the administrative capabilityof local communities or lower levels of government to implement such systems. Where governance and admin- istration at the national level are weak, the situation islikely to be even worse at lower levels of government. SELECTED READINGS Gray, J. A. 1983.

In addition to these, fines canalso be considered a type of forest charge. A summary of the main features of 12 different types of forest charges is given below: License charges. License charges are a type of royalty or fee to cover the administrative cost of issuing licenses. They are usually lump-sum payments that may vary by the license area or duration and can be collected at the start of a license or annually. T o be economically effi-cient, license charges should reflect the value of the secu-rity of wood supply conferred to the license holder orshould cover the cost of administering the license (or a combination of the two). They may also be used to cap-ture some of the value of production (that is, they may bepart of the royalty on production) if this is not fullyreflected in other charges. The costs of collection andadministration are low and these charges are difficult to evade, so they are administratively efficient. License charges tend to have little impact on equity, but they canbe used to redistribute income (by setting lower licensecharges for smaller operators, for instance). Licensecharges are quite common in the forestry sector. Annual area charges. These charges are usually a type of royalty and are calculated as a fixed amount multiplied by the whole license area. Annual area charges are gener- ally easy to administer and have little impact on equity. They can be economically efficient (that is, they canreflect the value of wood production), but it is often dif-ficult to assess the correct level of charges because of theneed for detailed information about forest stocking. Consequently, area charges are often used in combina-tion with volume-based charges to collect royalties. Charges based on standing volume, allowable cut, or prop- erty values. These charges can be a type of royalty or can be used for general tax collection, or both. They are usu- ally calculated as a fixed amount multiplied by standing volume or allowable cut or are related to property values.They are generally administratively efficient and have lit-tle impact on equity, but economic efficiency suffersfrom the same problems noted with annual area charges. The use of such charges as a component of royalty col-lection is not common, but these charges are sometimesused as a form of income tax on forest owners (mostly indeveloped countries).Charges based on the area logged. These charges are very similar to annual area charges, but are based on the area logged rather than the total license area. The main dif- ference is that it is sometimes difficult to determine the area that has been logged. These charges are not com-monly used. Volume-based charges. Volume-based charges are the most common type of royalty and are calculated by mul- tiplying the volume harvested by a price. The prices used in this calculation can be derived in a variety of ways. A simpler version of this is per tree charges (where thenumber of trees is multiplied by a price). These chargescan be economically efficient if the price reflects the truevalue of the wood produced, which is often not the case. The administrative efficiency of volume-based charges isoften low because considerable effort (and cost) isrequired to monitor the level of production and to estab-lish the correct price levels to use. Volume-based chargescan be inequitable because they are often the same for all producers and do not account for location-specific dif- ferences in production costs (such as terrain or distanceto market). However, they can be used as a policy tool, byadjusting charges to reflect policy objectives (for exam-ple, by deliberately lowering charges on lesser knownspecies to encourage their use). Charges on production of forest products. These charges are similar to volume-based charges but are charged on the output of processed forest products and nonwood forest products. They are common and can be collected in addi- tion to or in place of volume-based charges on round-wood. They can be used to support policy objectives (bydeliberately setting low charges for nonwood forest prod-ucts to promote rural income generation, for instance). Charges on exports. Charges on exports can be collected from exports of roundwood or processed forest products and are used in many countries. They have similar strengths and weaknesses to the charges on production of forest products but are generally more administra-tively efficient (because monitoring is usually easier andcosts less). The purpose of such charges can be to collectadditional royalties or general tax collection. A combina- tion of low volume-based charges and export charges onroundwood is frequently used to promote domestic pro-cessing of roundwood by deliberately distorting the mar-ket (that is, reducing the domestic roundwood price toless than the international trade price). NOTE 5.4: STRENGTHENING FISCAL SYSTEMS IN THE FORESTRY SECTOR 187ANNEX 5.4A A SUMMARY OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHARGES USED IN FISCAL SYSTEMS IN THE FORESTRY SECTORFees for services or materials provided. These charges are common and are payments for services or materials pro- vided by the forestry administration. They may or may not be voluntary, depending on whether the operator has a choice to request the service or materials. Theirpurpose should be to cover the costs of providing theseservices or materials, but they are sometimes used tocollect additional revenue. They are generally adminis- tratively efficient and have little impact on equity(unless a significant proportion of these charges are paidby small, low-income producers). They can be econom-ically efficient if they reflect the true value or cost of theservices or materials provided, which is often not the case. They can also be used to promote other policy objectives. Charges on equipment or workers. Specific charges on equipment or workers are uncommon, but a number of countries collect charges for registration or permits to trade in forest products or to operate processing plants. General taxes. Companies operating in the forestry sector are also usually required to pay the same taxes as other industries (corporate taxes, income taxes, sales taxes,value-added taxes, and so forth). Their purpose is to col- lect government revenue, and responsibility for suchtaxes is usually outside the control of the forestry admin-istration. However, in some countries, tax incentives areused to encourage certain forestry activities (afforesta-tion, for example). Profit-based royalties. These types of charges (sometimes called \"resource rents\") are usually calculated as a pro- portion of the profits earned by companies working in the sector. They are common in other extractive indus- tries (mining, for instance) but have rarely been used inthe forestry sector. Fines. The main purpose of fines is to deter illegal activ- ities in the forestry sector. Fines are usually fixed in legis- lation or regulations and are usually not based on any economic criteria, although they are sometimes based on a multiple of the value of illegal products seized or iden-tified by the forest administration (called \"compound-ing\"). The administrative and economic efficiency offines is generally low and could be improved in many countries. Similarly, if law enforcement is weak, theimposition of fines can be inequitable. 188 CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE Forest crime\u2014including illegal logging\u2014and cor- ruption are present throughout the world.1It is particularly troubling in developing countries, where illegal logging in public lands alone causes esti- mated losses in assets and revenue in excess of US$10 bil- lion annually, more than six times the total official devel-opment assistance dedicated to the sustainablemanagement of forests (World Bank 2004). Governmentslose as much as US$5 billion annually from evaded taxes and royalties on legally sanctioned logging. 1.6 billion peo-ple depend upon forests for part of their livelihoods, andas many as 350 million people living in and around forestsare heavily dependent on forests for their livelihoods andsecurity (see chapter 1, Forests and Poverty Reduction, and associated notes). These vulnerable groups are at risk from illegal logging and removal of timber and nontimberproducts from the forests. Moreover, violations of pro-tected area boundaries threaten the conservation of forestresources and biodiversity. Illegal logging also subjects legitimate forest enterprises to unfair competition through price undercutting and dis-courages them from making socially and environmentallyresponsible investments in the sector. There are less visi-ble\u2014though highly insidious\u2014costs resulting from the ero-sion of institutions, the spread of corruption across theeconomy, and reduced growth. Finally, forest crime creates negative environmental, economic, and social consequencesat the global level as well. Forests are a global public good,and their degradation imposes global costs, such as climatechange and species loss. While illegal logging and other forest crime can, from a national point of view, be important in both small and largeand high-forest and low-forest countries, from a global per-spective it is possible to indicate where these impacts arelikely to be most harmful. It is also possible to establish thatthe problems in the forest sector are closely linked tobroader issues of governance (figure 5.2).Trade has been identified as an important driver of ille- gal logging and other forest crime. The value of suspicious wood products worldwide may be as high as US$23 billion. Out of the total of illegal timber, it is estimated that about US$5 billion enters world trade, representing as much as 10percent of the value of global trade in primary wood prod-ucts. Trade in timber products is often routed through thirdcountries, adding another trade-related dimension to the problem (China, for example, reexports about 70 percent ofits timber imports). An economic analysis based on simula-tions from the Global Forest Products Model suggests thatthis illegal material depresses world prices by 7-16 percenton average (Seneca Creek Associates and Wood ResourcesInternational 2004). Forest crime ultimately results from a failure of the rule of law. Two types of failure in the legal system lead tocriminal behavior: failures of law and failures of imple- mentation (see note 5.3, Strengthening Legal Frameworks in the Forest Sector). When laws themselves are flawed orcontradictory, the focus of combating illegal logging andother forest crime should be on legal reform, whereaswhen the \"right\" laws are in place the focus should be onenforcement. Fuelwood accounts for the largest single use of wood (by volume) around the world. In developing countries, mostfuelwood is consumed for domestic and small-scale indus-trial uses and comes from family labor or informal supply systems that are often based on sources of supply outsideofficially recognized forest areas, such as farmland, brushand scrubland, and other scattered trees. A substantial por-tion of fuelwood collection takes place outside formal forestmanagement and in some, perhaps in many, circumstances,is in violation of the law. Other illicit activities are also associated with timber harvesting and trade, beyond cutting trees where andwhen it is proscribed. Such activities include irregulartimber sales; corruption in the award of concessions and 189ADDRESSING ILLEGAL LOGGING AND OTHER FOREST CRIMENOTE 5.5service contracting; evasion of taxes, royalties, and other fees by enterprises or by communities or private forestowners; circumvention of labor laws; and unauthorized wood processing. Although no reliable estimates are avail- able, anecdotal evidence and stakeholder interviews sug-gest that in state-owned forests, financial losses from cor-ruption can be as high as or even higher than those fromstolen timber (Savcor Indufor Oy 2005). In practice, the distinctions between illegal logging and other timber-related crime become blurred. The same perpetrators maybe responsible for outright theft or corruption-relatedillegal logging. Corruption and other financial crimes often involve money laundering, adding another dimension to theconstellation of what should be considered forest crime.In addition to the timber-related crimes, forest crimealso includes such illegal acti vities as wildlife poaching, arson, and unlawful conversion of forest lands for otheruses. Despite the magnitude of the problem and existing mea- sures to combat corruption (see box 5.17), there are fewinstances of prosecution and punishment. In fact, if thereare prosecutions, it is the poor, looking to supplement theirmeager livelihoods, who are victimized and sent to jail,while large-scale operators continue with impunity. Arguably, this is the worst form of violation of equity andjustice, arising from a clear failure of governance, and itneeds to be addressed.OPERATIONAL ASPECTS Understanding causes of illegal logging and other forest crime Reducing illegal logging and other forest crimes through Bank operations requires understanding the underlyingcauses and implementing actions that address these causes and complement national and local contexts. The ways that drivers behind illegal logging and forest crime operate arehighly country and location specific, and depend on eco-nomic, social, and cultural factors as well as the type of for-est resource and its ownership or tenure arrangements. An appropriate set of responses can only be defined at thecountry level in processes involving the key stakeholderswho interact with the forest resources. Means, motive, and opportunity construct. The \"means, motive, and opportunity construct\" (see annex 5.5A to this note) is useful to analyze the causes of crime. In thisframework, persons motivated by greed, need, or otherdesires employ the tools (means) available to them to exploitthe existing vulnerabilities (opportunities). Illegal loggingand other types of forest crime take place when these threefactors are in place simultaneously (that is, when there is amotive to act illegally, the pote ntial illegal operators have the means to do so, and the context in which they operate pro-vides an opportunity for illegal action) (figure 5.3). Theresponses to illegal logging and other forest crime then need 190 CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE Figure 5.2 Illegal Forest Activity and Its Link with Corruption 0 5 10Russia High % suspicious log supplyHigh corruption (TI)Brazil Acceding EU Japan USA CanadaEU-15MalaysiaOth L AmChinaOth Asia W/C Africa IndonesiaMore than 50% More than 20% -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80to focus on reducing the motivation for unlawful action, fore- closing the opportunities, and eliminating the means avail-able to those operating outside the boundaries of the law. The means, motive, and opportunity construct is of par- ticular value in suggesting areas of comparative advantageacross potential partners in improving forest law enforce-ment and governance. For example, consumer countriesand industry occupy particular niches in helping to reduce the motive for illegal logging by reforming markets and public procurement policies that discriminate against stolen NOTE 5.5: ADDRESSING ILLEGAL LOGGING AND OTHER FOREST CRIME 191Several types of tools can be used to combat forest sec- tor corruption in addition to the more standard insti-tutional and administrative safeguards (for example, those related to procurement and institutional struc- tures). Some of the more promising of these follow: Diagnostics, such as (i) creating a forest sector cor- ruption perception index; (ii) creating a forest corrup-tion risk map; (iii) producing a forest sector citizens' report card; (iv) documenting government perfor-mance on forest-related tasks; and (v) creating a score-card on forest law enforcement including arrests, pros-ecutions, convictions, and sentencing. Awareness raising and access to information, such as (i) developing an internet-based clearinghouse for information on forest sector corruption; (ii) briefing and educating journalists on forest-related corruption;(iii) anti-forest-corruption advertisements and othermedia campaigns; (iv) creating a site on forestconcessions and related information; (v) compiling aforest law and regulation reference book and making itavailable on paper and on the internet; and (vi) train-ing law enforcers and judges on technical issues related to forest corruption. Public institutional and business ethics, such as (i) establishment and implementation of model forest integrity pacts related to public contracting; (ii) defin-ing and agreeing to codes of conduct through businessassociations; (iii) promoting forest certification; (iv)implementing whistleblower encouragement and pro- tection programs; (v) establishing a safe channel forcitizens' complaints and producing a public report oncomplaints received; (vi) developing a professionalethics pledge and encouraging public officials to signit; and (vii) rewarding outstanding public service, per-haps through an awards program. Structures and events for stakeholder participation and dialogue, such as (i) representative local and national stakeholder committees; (ii) specific confer-ences and workshops on professional responsibilityand ethics; and (iii) best practices to combat forest sec-tor corruption or any other key issues emerging fromthe above.Box 5.17 Measures Specific to Combating Corruption in the Forest Sector Source: Adapted from Rosenbaum (2005).

Governments and financial institutions can help limit the development of excess wood-processing plants andequipment by requiring and exercising due diligence in assessing wood supply and land availability in consideration of wood-based and agro-industrial investments. Producercountries have obvious priority with respect to improvingforest management and control as an approach to reducingthe opportunities available for illegal activities. Need-based versus greed-based causes. Differentiating between illegal activities motivated by poverty (such as fuel- wood and fodder collection needs, for example) and thoseresulting from outright greed and that often involve organ-ized criminal activity (such as commercial logging in pro-tected areas) is also helpful in formulating effective andequitable responses to address these complex problems. Framework to combat illegal logging and other forest crime An effective strategy to combat illegal logging and other for- est crime combines elements of prevention, detection, andsuppression in a way that helps to achieve both short-term gains (such as increases in forest revenue, or the apprehen- sion and conviction of the most flagrant violators of laws)to maintain the momentum of the process, and longer-termsystemic changes (legal and institutional reforms and reduc-tion of possibilities for corrupt behavior). Prevention. Prevention combines the promotion of good governance in and outside the forest sector in general with more specific actions focused directly on forest crime. Linksto broader development (poverty reduction, land use, indus-trial development, rural development, institutional reform,and the like) and forest sector policies, strategies, and pro-grams (such as national forest programs) are evident, as arelinks to legislation in other sectors. These links require coor-dination to avoid overlaps and missed opportunities. Effective prevention of forest crime may need to address the following issues: Supply-demand imbalances Improving the availability of legal wood (fuelwood, char- coal, and building materials) or substitutes (kerosene,solar energy, gas) to meet basic needs of rural and urban populations Improving the availability and reducing the cost of legal industrial roundwood (for instance, through industrialplantations; see note 3.3, Forest Plantations)Ensuring that proper due diligence on the availability oflegal timber is carried out before authorizing or financ-ing forest industry capacity expansion (see note 5.4, Strengthening Fiscal Systems in the Forest Sector) Restructuring industry and downscaling excess capacity Quality of legal and regulatory frameworks within and out-side the forest sector Securing forest land tenure and access rights of the local or indigenous communities to timber and wildlife (seenote 1.4, Property and Access Rights) Ensuring recognition of the legitimate needs of differentstakeholders in forest concession agreements Simplifying overly complex laws and regulations that are not in line with the capacity of the different groups of forest users to comply with the legal requirements (especially for community and small-scale private forest owners) Identifying and resolving conflicting legislation and reg- ulations (central vs. decentralized levels, different sec-tors) (see note 5.1, Decentralized Forest Management) Reducing unreasonably high costs of compliance for legaloperators (by streamlining administrative procedures andreducing processing time of contracts and permits) Increasing costs of illegal operators through adjustmentsin penal codes to ensure that these constitute effectivedeterrents to forest crime Including appropriate means to prevent crime in forestmanagement plans in commercial concessions (forexample, by closing roads after harvesting, employing routine patrols, and determining what sort of tree mark- ing and log labeling systems are used) Institutional structures and incentives Addressing broader governance failures, such as lack of transparency and accountability, and corruption (forexample, by reorganization of the public forest adminis- tration, improvements in procedures for concession award and timber sales, improvements to financial auditsystems and staff incentive systems) Promoting independent forest certification schemes and other demand-side measures related to corporate socialresponsibility (for example, third-party audited systems for verification of legal wood origin), especially in cases where demand for timber and other forest products isdriven by export markets (see note 3.2, Forest Certifica-tion Systems) Creating positive incentives for those complying with legal requirements, especially in situations where they 192 CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE initially have to compete wi th illegal operators (for example, reduced concession fees for producers certified by an independent third-party) Promoting partnerships with civil society, such as con-sultative groups and joint government-civil societystructures for monitoring forest activities Creating and strengthening high-level, intersectoralcoordination mechanisms to harmonize policies, mini-mize negative cross-sectoral impacts (for example, with agricultural policies), and ensure that broader reforms have important and positive law enforcement benefits inthe forest sector Collaborating with financial institutions to establish means to foreclose opportunities to launder profits fromillegal forest operations Forest monitoring and information Improving information on forest resources and legalharvest at the forest management unit level (for example,forest inventories and management plans that are of appropriate technical quality and detail, and log-tracking and chain-of-custody systems) (see note 7.2, EstablishingForest Information Management Systems) Publicly disclosing information on forest cover change, forest concessions, management plans and harvestingquotas, logging and timber transport, and forest rev- enues; and making such information accessible (for example, by posting it on the internet) to minimizemanipulation, self-censorship, and physical risk to thoseinvolved in law enforcement Capacity building and awareness Improving capacity of both forest and judicial authori- ties to enforce forest legislation from detection to con-viction, thus establishing an effective deterrent Conducting campaigns that inform the public about theprovisions of forest law in local languages, thereby ensur-ing that users are at least aware of rights, restrictions, and prohibitions Indicating actions that the public can take to support law enforcement efforts (for example, ways to report illegalactivity) Because preventive measures target the fundamental problems underlying illegal logging, many of them can be expected to take effect only in the medium and long term. Detection. Detection refers to various methods of collect- ing and processing information on forest crime and relatedtrade with the objective of iden tifying illegal activities and facilitating the design of improved policies. Detection can entail the following: Monitoring and surveillance to determine if and where crime is occurring, to set priorities, and to evaluate otherelements of the enforcement program. The kinds of infor- mation that are needed include the geographic incidence of different crimes, the types of crimes that are occurring,the types of perpetrators, and the apparent levels of crime. Using systems that include satellites, aircraft, and ground monitoring and surveillance personnel to document thelocation, type, volume, and if possible, the identity of violators involved in illegal logging activities. The proce- dures used to draw inferences for use with the rest of thelaw enforcement program are just as important as thesophistication of the data collection processes. Employing indirect methods to assess the prevalence of illegal activity (for example, comparisons of data on pro-duction, consumption, and trade in forest products often show significant disparities between trading partners' recorded exports and imports. These differences canindicate the potential magnitude of timber theft, smug-gling, and transfer pricing). Establishing a process to determine if any institutional weaknesses exist that can create opportunities for timbertheft (such as opportunities created by inadequate boundary marking, product marking, product measur- ing, product tracking, or an inadequate process of check-ing for revenue payments). Collecting evidence and documentation on a specific incident as the basis for arrests, judicial proceedings,fines, or other action. Specialized expertise is needed to employ techniques that are appropriate to the suspected crime and the national legal system. Establishing crime monitoring systems that collect data for evaluating the enforcement program's impact and effi-ciency, and for providing feedback to program planners. Increasing forest transparency and crime detectionthrough independent forest monitoring, especially incountries with weak government systems prone to cor- ruption. Suppression. Suppression of illegal activity should be the last recourse in a forest law enforcement program, because it almost inevitably involves the use of force. Suppression measures pose risks to agency personnel, the public, and thelawbreaker. The indiscriminate use of force also poses risksto the public at large. Because the people involved in crimi- NOTE 5.5: ADDRESSING ILLEGAL LOGGING AND OTHER FOREST CRIME 193nal activity at the field level are often simply laborers (and usually poor people with few alternatives) working at thedirection of others, genuine ethical reasons exist to question the use of force. In any responsible suppression program, these risks need to be systematically considered in light ofthe probability of success, the accountability and trans-parency of the suppression effort, and the skills and trainingavailable to law enforcers. In addition, suppression is an area for which the World Bank has strict guidelines based on itsmandate that define its level of involvement. Effective suppression may require the following: Developing risk-success matrices to make appropriate preparations for safe conduc t of suppression operations, or to determine when safe operations are a practical impossibility. Such matrices should be developed by law enforcement practitioners. Tailoring institutional arrangements for major suppres- sion efforts or crackdowns to local circumstances (seenote 5.2, Reforming Forest Institutions). However, these arrangements also clearly need to incorporate adequate provisions for accountability and transparency commen-surate with the likely use of force and the need for secu-rity and confidentiality. Developing interagency arrangements in which the police, military, customs, and other law enforcementagencies frequently and effectively work together with natural resource agencies. These arrangements require resources, budgets, planning, and reporting provisions tobe in place. Training staff members at all levels where extraordinary suppression efforts are needed, for example, in special-ized skills such as investigating criminal activities, docu- menting crimes, handling evidence, and preparing judi- cial proceedings. In highly dangerous or specializedinvestigations, training approp riate for undercover oper- ations, firearms safety, and other special expertise may beneeded. The complexity and risk of suppression efforts under- score the value of measures to avoid the emergence of a seri- ous law enforcement problem through sound preventionand detection efforts. Where such efforts fail, or are notmade, the problems of suppression can rapidly becomenearly insurmountable. Many of the specific interventions and tools discussed above can simultaneously contribute to more than one ofthe enforcement functions of prevention, detection, or sup-pression. Issues of cost, risk, capacity, and commitment need to be addressed in the design of these programs. Annex 5.5B to this note brings the drivers of forest crime (motive, means, and opportunity) together with the preven-tion-detection-suppression framework in several typicaltypologies of forest crime, and can be used as a tool to facil- itate discussion in country contexts (for example, in thecontext of national-level action plans as discussed below). National-level processes to combat illegal logging and other forest crime National and local level forest law enforcement program. Forest law enforcement programs need to be for- mulated at the national and local levels, building on estab- lished laws, institutional arrangements, and the interests and capabilities of different stakeholders, and need toaddress the specific crime problems being encountered. As a consequence of the FLEG processes (see chapter 5), some countries are beginning to address forest crime through concerted, coordinated, multistakeholder, national-level FLEG processes, resulting in national-level FLEGaction plans. Experience with these processes has demon-strated that combating illegal logging and other forest crimeis as much a political process as it is technical, and involves reconciliation of the various stakeholder interests in a man- ner that enables change. Where the economic stakes in ille-gal activities are high, powerful interest groups can force-fully protect the status quo even if the outcome is clearlynegative from society's point of view. Stakeholder coalitions. Rarely is one stakeholder group able to push through a major change in the established power balance. Instead, successful change processes rely oncoalitions of several interest groups with different capaci-ties. Local and international NGOs have often managed tobring the problem of illegal logging out in the open and raise awareness among politicians and the general public ofthe need to act. Representatives from interest groupsdirectly involved in timber production can wield consider-able influence among their peers and colleagues. High-levelpolitical champions are also required who are able to fendoff efforts to slow down the implementation of the pro-posed measures through behind-the-scenes maneuvering. Partners willing to support FLEG can be found among many stakeholder groups. Ministries of finance and localmunicipalities are interested in the increased tax revenuethat reduction of illegal activi ties could bring about. Forest 194 CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE enterprises may be motivated to join the effort because of market pressure or ethical reasons. Local people whoserights are trampled by illegal loggers are potential partners, as are NGOs concerned about protection of the environ- ment, human rights, and democracy. In addition, there arealways individuals in all stakeholder groups and institu-tions, including public forest administration, who need noother motivation than pursuit of fairness and justice. Exter- nal partners can reinforce and support these progressivegroups and, within the boundaries of their mandates, facil-itate their work at the political and technical levels. FLEG processes should bring partners together. The aim of a national FLEG process should be to bring all these partners together to enable them to reinforce each other.Although it is evident that there will not and should not beany standard model for such processes, some common ele-ments seem to characterize the more promising initiativescurrently under way: Establishment of a mechanism for interministerial coor- dination, and a forum for stakeholder participation Use of an analytical process for assessing the magnitude,scope, and dimension of the problems related to lawenforcement and governance Creation of awareness, information sharing, and if nec-essary, whistle blowing, to \"name and shame\" the worstperpetrators of forest crimes Use of a consultative and consensus-building process todefine the scope of actions and priorities Detailed definitions of the actions, responsible stake-holders, mechanisms of implementation, and financing(both internal and possible external sources) Obtaining political endorsement and support for theFLEG actions LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS General lessons Successful change processes rely on coalitions of several interest groups with different capacities.Partners willing to support FLEG can be found among many stakeholder groups, such as ministries of finance and local municipalities, forest enterprises, local people, and NGOs. Inaddition, all stakeholder groups and institutions, includingpublic forest administrations, house individuals who needno other motivation than the pursuit of fairness and justice. External partners can reinforce and support these progres-sive groups and, within the boundaries of their mandates,facilitate their work at political and technical levels. Where the economic stakes in illegal activities are high, powerful interest groups can fo rcefully protect the status quoeven if the outcome is clearly negative from society's point of view. Country-level lessons Address key drivers both within and outside theforest sector. Some governance issues relating to forest crime lie entirely within the forest sector while others affect- ing forests and forest-dependent people extend beyond this sector. Some of the governance work of other parts of theWorld Bank Group may help address these nonforest-sectorissues, including support to Poverty Reduction StrategyPaper processes and the alignment of the World Bank's CASs with these processes, work on governance diagnosticsand integration of governance and anticorruption elementsin the CASs, and the design of specific capacity-buildingprograms based on the diagnostic surveys (Poverty Reduc-tion and Economic Management Network and the World Bank Institute). Other relevant areas of the World Bank focus on anti-money laundering and financial investigation(Financial Market Integrity group, Extractive IndustriesTransparency Initiative, Justice for the Poor, and customsmodernization). The World Bank's legal department is car-rying out important work in assessing the quality of legaland regulatory frameworks. Similarly, some of the work oncorporate social responsibility and social and environmen-tal issues in the operations of the International Finance Cor-poration (for example, investment safeguard policies) isextremely relevant to FLEG issues. Combine actions with both short- and long-term implications in a realistic, step-wise plan. Visible short- term impacts are often needed to create and maintain momen-tum, whereas long-term work on the structural drivers is nec-essary to ensure that these efforts are sustainable over time.Early \"wins\" (for example, significant increases in forest rev-enue) are important to motivating continued efforts. Address both failures of law and failures of imple- mentation. First, ensure that the correct laws and policies are in place. Second, work to enforce the law. This two- NOTE 5.5: ADDRESSING ILLEGAL LOGGING AND OTHER FOREST CRIME 195pronged approach to legal compliance is the only way to ensure that the full range of motivations, opportunities, andmeans for illegal behavior are addressed. Strengthen supply-side measures with measures to control imports of illegal timber and wood prod-ucts. This is especially important in countries where export demand is a significant driver of illegal activities in the for- est sector. It should be noted that\u2014at least in principle\u2014these measures could also be extended to other products(for example, wildlife or products derived from illegal con-version of forest lands). Integrate anti-money-laundering and asset forfei- ture laws into the fight against forest crime andrelated corruption. These tools, along with the UN Con- ventions Against Corruption and Transnational OrganizedCrime, provide strong and effective regimes that govern-ments can use to fight forest crime and related corruption. Risks Focusing more directly on illegal logging and other forest crimes will not always be a natural or comfortable role fordevelopment agencies, including the World Bank. Inevitably, development agencies will become involved in complex and controversial issues regarding the quality oflaws, and at times these institutions will be put at odds withpowerful interest groups, including high-level governmentofficials, defending the status quo for personal gain. Conse- quently, there are two potential areas of risk for the devel-opment community: As with any complex and controversial issue involving different interests and actors, there are reputational risks related to work with FLEG. The World Bank and its part- ners need to be especially sensitive to issues related to human rights and equity in their work. Transparency andadvocacy and support for participatory approaches areimportant means to avoid these types of risks. A more vigorous engagement with FLEG will also inevitably involve difficult issues related to national sov-ereignty in the management of natural resources. This political risk needs to be carefully managed. Opportunities Specific opportunities for action by the international com- munity include the following:Address critical gaps in the understanding of the natureof the governance challenge. An illustrative list of impor-tant areas for focus follows: - Development of diagnostics to benchmark forest crime and the state of forest governance in high-priority countries, and identification of indicators to monitorthe progress of proposed interventions - Advancements in the role of independent monitors in making forest operations more transparent and in providing legal operators with positive incentives - Institutional (and incentive-compatible) reforms of forestry agencies in Bank client countries that includegaining a better understanding of the role of incen- tives (including salary structure and so on) for civil servants - Development approaches to forest industry restruc- turing and retrenchment that will efficiently andeffectively help address imbalances in wood supplyand demand - Establishment of information management systems and use of geographic information systems for overallmonitoring of the forest resource Deepen the technical content of FLEG processes at the international and national levels, mobilize opportunitiesfor multilateral enforcement action, and integrate the regional FLEG processes into existing structures for regional cooperation Promote collaboration between the progressive elements of the industry, international financing institutions, andinternational NGOs involved in the FLEG process to develop, improve, and harmonize safeguards and due diligence on forest investments (see note 5.4, Strengthen-ing Fiscal Systems in the Forest Sector). The aim shouldbe both to ensure the legality of the timber used and tomitigate the risk for other forest crimes, such as poach- ing, arson, and encroachment of forest areas, resultingfrom forest industry investments. Ensure effective coordination between the implementa- tion of the FLEGT Regulation and Action Plan and otherFLEG efforts. The aim should be to strengthen the links between the voluntary partnership agreements envi- sioned in the FLEGT action plan and the lending andadvisory operations of the international financing insti-tutions, especially the World Bank. Explore the potential for initiatives similar to the Extrac- tive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)2to increase transparency of forest sector financial flows in some keyforest countries, especially where a relatively small num- ber of companies operate large forest concessions. 196 CHAPTER 5: IMPROVING FOREST GOVERNANCE NOTES 1.

people to resources they need for subsistence or livelihoods Indiscriminate (regarding legality of origin) demand fortimber in neighboring countries Indiscriminate international demand for timber Economic factors and policies favoring forest conversion Low cost of illegal timber (t hat is, ineffective sanctions) and rent-seeking business culture in the forest sectorcompanies Overcapacity in the wood processing industry Difficulty complying with legal regulations (especially bysmall-scale producers, concession holders, communities,and private forest owners) Bureaucratic laws related to forest management (cost ofcomplying with laws is too high) Means Roads, navigable rivers, harbors, and other transportinfrastructure Labor in forest areas (often without alternative sources oflivelihoods) Capital to finance illegal logging and other forest crimeEquipment for logging and transport of timber andwood products Opportunities for money laundering to hide financialproceeds Opportunity Weak governance in parts or all of the country (includ-ing areas affected by conflict and war) Breakdown of institutional controls and lack of account-ability of public officials Rapid and

Note: P = prevention; D = detection; S = suppression.One of the targets under the Millennium Develop- ment Goals for ensuring environmental sustain-ability requires that countries integrate the prin- ciples of sustainable development into country policies and programs and reverse the loss of environmental resources.In line with this, macro policy reforms should give foremostconsideration to ensuring enabling conditions for sustain-able development, enhancing synergies and minimizing negative impacts on natural resources. For forests, the com-bined impacts of economic activities outside the forest sec-tor are often significantly greater than those produced byeconomic activity within the sector itself. Several policy areas can impact forests and forest devel- opment, including macroeconomic policies (fiscal, mone-tary, trade, privatization, and public expenditure policies);population and social affairs; agriculture, fisheries, gamemanagement, livestock; rural and development,land use planning, land tenure; infrastructure; industry;energy; environment 1; and tourism. Macro policy reforms are central to strengthening an economy. Governments reform fiscal, exchange rate, and monetary policies, and make changes in trade policies, land reform, and privatiza- tion policies as part of adjustment packages to address eco-nomic imbalances, balance of payments, and structuralweaknesses in their economy. Measures such as these\u2014regardless of origin\u2014can and do have significant impacts on natural resources in general. For example, real exchangerate depreciation (currency devaluation) favors the expan-sion of tradables (many agricultural, forest, and mineralproducts) over nontradables (services, construction, andsubsistence production). That generally encourages expan-sion of agriculture, logging, and mining. In addition, it canalso boost sectors that use more land and labor and lessimported capital and might, therefore, encourage moreextensive agriculture. Conversely, exchange rate deprecia-tion sometimes induces farmers to shift to export crops orproduction systems that require less land. Fiscal policy directed at short-run stabilization, the implementation of growth and other long-term objectives,and decentralization policy (see note 5.1, Decentralized For-est Management) as a major instrument of national eco- nomic reform in many developing countries and countriesin transition, all can affect forests and other naturalresources. Such broadly based adjustments, which wereoften part of stabilization and structural adjustment policiesrecommended by the World Bank and, more often, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have in the past beencriticized for their negative impacts on the poor, on naturalresources, and on the environment (see box 6.1). In therecent past, development policy decreased emphasis on restoring balance of payment and exchange rates, andfocused on budget support geared toward domestic financ-ing needs. The World Bank's development policy lending(DPL) portfolio has included promoting competitive mar- ket structures, correcting distortions in incentive regimes,establishing appropriate monitoring and safeguards in thefinancial sector, judicial reform, and adopting moderninvestment codes to create an environment conducive to 203Mainstreaming Forests into Development Policy and PlanningCHAPTER 6private sector investment, thus promoting good gover- nance, encouraging private sector activity, and mitigatingshort-term adverse effects of adjustment. Independent of this evolution in DPL, some of the pol- icy reforms can have unintended negative effects on forests or create opportunities for enhancing the forest sector.Where forests are a significant part of the economic andsocial resource base of a country, therefore, it will be neces- sary to mainstream forest considerations into developmentpolicies and planning processes, and to consider exogenousimpacts. Forests are part of the national capital base in most developing countries, and have important links to other natural resources, especially water, soil, and, in some cases, coastal marine assets. In developing countries, natural capi-tal generally has a larger role to play in overall economicdevelopment than in wealthier countries. Therefore, alter-native sources of capital for investment are scarcer, and thefocus tends to be more heavily oriented toward naturalresource utilization, through mining, forestry, agriculture,rural industries, and so on. The condition and sustainabilityof those resources is therefore of critical importance to theprospects for development and maintenance of economic growth at the national scale. PAST ACTIVITIES The World Bank's main engagement in macroeconomicreforms is through DPL. DPL is rapidly disbursing, policy-based financing that the Bank provides in the form of loans or grants to help a borrower address actual or anticipated development financing requirements that have domestic orexternal origins. These operations are large in scope and intheir objectives. They support the policy and institutionalchanges needed to create an environment conducive to sus- tained and equitable growth. Typically, they will includeimproving the investment climate, diversification of theeconomy, employment creation, and support for meetinginternational commitments. DPL was originally designed to provide support for macroeconomic policy reforms, such as in trade policy andagriculture. Over time it has evolved to focus more on struc-tural, financial sector, and social policy reform and onimproving public sector resource management. Develop- 204 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGIn 1997 the IMF and the World Bank provided an adjustment loan to Indonesia following the financialsector crisis in that country. The IMF began its negoti- ations with the government of Indonesia on an assis- tance package in October 1997. The original letter ofintent focused on banking sector reform and otherfinancial sector issues, and initially did not includeenvironmental provisions. Information that forestry was the second largest contributor to Indonesian exportincome and was probably a sector that may survive theeconomic crisis better than others resulted in the IMFand the Bank incorporating specific forest sector condi-tions into the frameworks of these instruments. By January 1998, the loan had become a US$43 bil- lion assistance package, which included a set of envi-ronmental and forest sector reforms aimed at disman-tling the forest product marketing monopolies thathad dominated the sector and committed the govern-ment to implementation of a series of forest concessionmanagement reforms that the World Bank and otherdevelopment agencies had been promoting in Indone-sia for a considerable time.In April 1998, the World Bank followed up on the IMF package with the first of two Policy Reform Sup- port Loans (PRSLs), with a loan value of US$1 billion, which was followed by a second PRSL in the following year. The PRSL loans added detailed provisions callingfor reform of regulations and legislation governing theaward and management of concessions; an interimmoratorium on any further conversion of forested lands to other uses; and moves toward stronger partic-ipation of local communities in the management andprotection of forests, and ultimately recognition of tra-ditional title to forest. Lessons drawn from the Indonesian experiences are that (i) good, up-to-date analysis will allow for effective links between reforms introduced and outcomes for forests and forest-dependent people to be assessed, and(ii) careful monitoring of actual outcomes and follow-up with more focused and longer term operations (aswas proposed but not pursued in the Indonesia case)are essential to good results.Box 6.1 Indonesian Structural Adjustment and Forests Source: Douglas and Chandrasekharan Bher 2006.ment policy operations now generally aim to promote com- petitive market structures (legal and regulatory reform),correct distortions in incentive regimes (taxation and trade reform), establish appropriate monitoring and safeguards (financial sector reform), create an environment conduciveto private sector investment (judicial reform, adoption of amodern investment code), encourage private sector activity(privatization and public-private partnerships), promote good governance (civil service reform), and mitigate short-term adverse effects of development policy (establishmentof social protection funds). Between fiscal years 2004 and 2006, the World Bank approved 258 development policy loans. Of those, 11 had forestry components with IBRD/IDA commitments totaling some US$94 million or 9 percent of the total IBRD/IDAcommitment for those 11 projects. DPL has been most fre-quently employed in Africa. There were 50 additional DPLswith activities not formally classified as forest componentsbut that included forest-related actions under a broaderagriculture-forestry-fisheries classification. The other DPLsmight have had effects on forests, but this information wasnot available in the program documents. Efforts are beingmade to use the policy lending instrument to generate pos-itive outcomes for the forest sector. Examples include Brazil,Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Ghana and the Lao People's Democratic Republic (see boxes6.12 through 6.14 in note 6.2). The World Bank's experience in analyzing cross-sectoral outcomes in forests (or natural resources more generally)from lending activities, including the newer programmaticapproach of DPL, is growing. Upstream analytical work,including country environmental analyses (CEAs) andstrategic environmental assessments (SEAs) conductedbefore DPLs has increased. The Bank has also institutional-ized a system whereby policy loans are reviewed by environ-mental, natural resource, and forest specialists at the conceptstage to ensure that likely significant effects of the loan onthe environment, forests, and natural resources are identifiedand measures are taken to enhance positive outcomes andminimize unintended negative impacts. KEY ISSUES Distinguishing between cross-sectoral and macro- economic impacts.2Cross-sectoral impacts on forests can emerge from specific activities and investments in relatedsectors: rural development, infrastructure and transport, specific resource extraction projects, and so on. By and large, these are straightforward situations, and approachesfor identifying impacts and developing methods to amelio- rate or eliminate them are available (see annexes to note 6.3and suggested readings). A potential exception is the ques-tion of impacts on the forest-dependent poor because of thelack of knowledge on the numbers of poor in forests and thenature and extent of their dependence on forests. Macro-economic policy changes can create shifts in the nationalexchange rate, in trade outcomes (and policies), and othermajor economic areas. The impacts on forests and othernatural resources of large-scale economic changes andreforms will manifest themselves through a complex web ofsecond- and third-round activities and associatedresponses. Identifying the nature of their eventual impactson forests\u2014or even whether there will be significantimpacts\u2014in specific cases is not straightforward. Understanding what impacts forest sustainability. The definition of forest sustainability and how best toachieve it have been widely debated in the forest communityfor more than two decades. The issue of the importance of exogenous influences on forests is critical to determininghow to achieve forest sustainability. Practitioners concernedwith mainstreaming forest considerations into policy dia-logue, cross-sectoral impacts, and assessing impact ofmacro policy reform on forests will need to be keptinformed of the status of this debate because the view takenon cause-and-effect in this area has direct relevance to therole that large-scale economic reform will have and, accord-ingly, potential entry points for introducing forest issues. There are two distinct interpretations for the failure of sustainable forest management (SFM). The first interpreta-tion focuses on problems of unbalanced vested interests andrelated inadequacies of sector governance, including thepoor performance of public forest agencies and the privatesector in many countries, and the lack of adequate title andaccess rights to forests by local communities. This interpre-tation assumes that if the highlighted problems are ade-quately addressed, the agencies and groups in society responsible for managing forests will have an appropriatepolicy basis, and adequate capacity, to address problems thatmay develop under broader economic change. The second interpretation holds that many of the eco- nomic and social forces influencing forests and forest- dependent people are initiated a long way from the forestsector itself and can only effectively be manipulated byagents that operate well outside the sector; thus, attemptingto deal with the resulting problems in forests through incen- tives and institutional issues within the sector may be nec-essary but will be insufficient to address the problems. In CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNING 205line with this thinking, many of the decisions on large-scale economic and social changes that are having an impact onforests are made by people with little or no involvement in the forest sector, and seldom contacted by forest sector spe- cialists. Under this interpretation, the options for sustain-ability available to forest stakeholders are constrained. Anavenue is for the donor agencies, in their dialogue with eco-nomic and social policy ministries on policy loans, to agree on supportive measures for the forest sector, such as train-ing and education programs and consultative activities. Creating entry points for introducing forest issues and timing. Raising the profile and relevance of forest issues among ministers of finance and social programs willrequire rigorous analytical work to translate forest issuesinto economic issues. Analysis of the economic contributionof forests (or the impact of forest conversion or degradationon the national economy) and forest-poverty links (see note 1.1, Mainstreaming the Role of Forests in Poverty Allevia-tion and note 1.4, Property and Access Rights) could create entry points for incorporating forest considerations in macroeconomic and sectoral policy dialogues. The processfor informing relevant sector and finance ministries shouldbe tailored to the country context to ensure credibility. Rel-evant analytical findings should be available at key inter- vention points in national policy processes. Indirect effects. Changes in tree cover or access to forest resources are often the result of direct causes, such as log- ging and pressures to increase agricultural and pastureareas. Logging and forest conversion themselves, however,are the result of various economic factors. Angelsen andKaimowitz (1999) provide a framework for understandingthe indirect causes of deforestation. One step examines the 206 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGSince fiscal 2002, several lending operations in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region have focusedon energy sector reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery in the region. In 2004 the World Bank reviewed the fiscal, efficiency,social, and environmental dimensions of reforms inthe energy sector in seven countries in the ECAregion (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Moldova, and Poland) (Lampietti 2004).This study provided food for thought regardingpotential environmental impacts, including thoseassociated with human health benefits resulting fromreduced pollution from the electricity sector. Thestudy also discussed the possibility that reforms have damaged health because households switched to dirty fuels (such as wood, coal, or kerosene). Because ofinadequate data, the study could not evaluate theimpact of reforms on fuel switching, energy use, sub-stitution effects, and health and social impacts. Nev-ertheless, such facts as \"in Armenia 80 percent ofhouseholds and 95 percent of poor householdsreported using alternative fuel sources to reducereliance on electricity (primarily wood (60 percent)and/or gas (24 percent))\" (Lampietti 2004:44) and thepossibility that fuelwood use may cause deforestationraised concern.This analytical work justified the poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) undertaken prior to an energy reform operation in Azerbaijan (World Bank 2004). The PSIA used spatial information to assess the envi- ronmental impact of energy reform. The methodologyenabled the identification of areas where households(because of poverty) might switch to dirty fuels. Over-laying this information with data on forest cover revealed where the risk of increased residential wooduse is greatest. With this information it was possible toconsider promoting access to alternative energysources and more efficient wood stoves in high-riskareas, and preparing and implementing spatiallyexplicit forest management plans and encouraging participatory forest management to reduce this risk. The data for this study were collected with extensive in-country collaboration. Local stakeholders partici- pated in two consultative workshops and various dis-cussions to help guide the research and included repre-sentatives from the Ministry of EconomicDevelopment, the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, theMinistry of Labor and Social Assistance, and the Par-liamentary Committee on Energy. There was also closecollaboration and support from the Ministry of Agri-culture, the State Statistical Committee, and the StateAmelioration and Water Management Committee.

The next level addresses the underlying causes of deforestation. These are the broader forces thatdetermine the decision parameters and include the macro-economic variables and policy instruments. The temporal factor. In the case of large-scale policy lending, the temporal factor also comes into play: The impact of large economic and other changes that affectforests may take a considerable number of years to becomeevident at the field level in forests\u2014long after disburse- ments under a policy loan or policy intervention that may have been a factor in the changes have been completed.Annex 6A to this chapter illustrates the temporal dimensionof the potential impact of energy sector reform on forests. Country context. Recent efforts to assess cross-sectoral impacts have not been able to demonstrate an empirical connection between macroeconomic structural adjustmentprograms and deforestation (Pandey and Wheeler 2001).Because of the complexity of the issues, the indirect natureof many of the causal relations, and the wide diversity of sit-uations, any attempt to generalize is inherently difficult. The study by Pandey and Wheeler (2001) suggests that theimpacts of structural adjustment on forests could vary bycountry and may be related to the nature of their forestresource. Sedjo (2005) suggests that a country with a com-parative advantage in forestry (usually a forest-rich coun-try) that is already exporting forest products could seeincreased forest products exports in response to structuraladjustment. In contrast, the forest sector in a country with-out a comparative advantage in timber production may facelimited changes in response to structural adjustment. TheWorld Bank publication on DPL and Forest Outcomes(2005) suggests that other country characteristics may alsoshape how macroeconomic reforms influence forestresource use and management. Importance of poverty . Poverty issues must also be directly considered when assessing cross-sectoral impacts (see also chapter 1, Forests for Poverty Reduction, and asso-ciated notes). In addition to their role in underpinning envi-ronmental stability, forests play a direct role in povertyalleviation\u2014the primary objective of World Bank involve-ment. It is evident from the World Bank's own assessment ofthis situation, as laid out in the revised Forests Strategy(World Bank 2004a), and from anecdotal evidence, fieldexperience, and other studies and articles, that forests are extremely valuable to the livelihoods of large numbers ofpoor people. The forests most subject to competition for the various forms of use and conversion that can arise from macroeco- nomic and other exogenous developments are often those ofimportance to significant numbers of rural poor. These willbe forests located at the margins of current agricultural and other land-using developments, where the poor have tendedto congregate because they have reduced access to otherrural areas and production assets. More systematic analysis and knowledge on the nature and level of dependence of these people on the forests for subsistence and income generation needs to be developed. Positive impacts on forests from macroeconomic reforms. Discussions of cross-sectoral impacts tend to focus, as this one has, on the avoidance of inadvertent harmbecause of the reputational risks and transaction costsinvolved. However, the literature is inconclusive regardingthe directionality of the relationship. Some studies havefound that structural adjustment can have negative out-comes and create pressure on the environment and forests(Angelsen and Kaimowitz, 1999; Sunderlin et al. 2000).Other studies have found ambiguous results, or in some cases, positive outcomes for income and environmentalbenefits (Gueorgieva and Bolt 2003; Munasinghe 2001). Elements could potentially be identified to be included in policy lending and large cross-sectoral programs that couldbring about positive outcomes for forests and forest-dependent people (Wunder 2003; box 6.3). For example,macro policy changes can be oriented toward creating anenvironment conducive to private sector engagement. Iflinked with community initiatives, such changes couldenable community-company partnerships and createemployment for forest-dependent households. Irreversibility. The well-known asymmetry in the forest- loss dynamic adds urgency to the need to address cross- sectoral impacts. In agriculture, or more generally, for eco-nomic development and social programs, poor outcomesfrom a given set of policy changes can be identified throughmonitoring and, in most cases, corrected within a reason-able time. In forests, however, impacts causing loss of forestsor woodlands, and watersheds that depend on this form ofvegetation, usually cannot be ameliorated so easily. Evolving policy instruments. Policy instruments are beginning to change, putting more emphasis on financial CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNING 207incentives, persuasion, and procedures than on regulation. Timber labeling, for example, aims to influence the behav-ior of timber customers by making the external costs of products more transparent (see note 3.2, Forest Certifica- tion Systems). Another trend is to seek the voluntary agree-ment of forest owners for the establishment of nature pro-tection zones by compensating them contractually forincome losses. As measures become more effective because they are implemented by stakeholders that understand andagree on them, procedural and persuasive instruments aremore widely used. Regional planning, Local Agenda 21 3, and other participatory and coordination mechanisms are important policy steering instruments in this context. National forest programs (NFPs), promoted as planning instruments at the national and subnational levels to reach the goal of sustainable forest development, use a holisticapproach that is much different from previous sector plan-ning procedures. Within NFPs, intersectoral approaches are seen as a necessary core element (UN-CSD 1997). Thisreflects lessons learned from previous policy and planninginstruments, in particular the Tropical Forestry Action Plan(TFAP). Experience with the preparation and implementa-tion of the TFAP at the country level showed that many actions failed to halt deforestation because the objectivesand instruments concentrated too narrowly on the forestry sector (Humphreys 1996). Need for additional data. Data on the degree and nature of forest dependency of large numbers of people (many of whom will be among the poorest in a given country) arelimited, imprecise, and often unclear in their implicationsfor national policy. Moreover, the physical impacts onforests that most impinge upon the livelihoods of peopleliving in or near them are not particularly well-identified bythe broad and presently available parameters such as changes in forest cover and forest trade and market data. As a result, the poverty implications of impacts upon forests are likely to be undervalued in broad national pro-grams and objectives. Perverse incentives and misallocationof resources leading to forest removal or changes in the sta-tus of use and ownership of forests will be a risk factor fromthe poverty-alleviation viewpoint, and could be exacerbatedby broader policy measures in a development policy loandesigned without the necessary knowledge in this area. Monitoring cross-sectoral impacts. The temporal dimension and indirect nature of cross-sectoral impacts underscores the importance of effective systems for moni-toring forest cover and changes in forests' contribution toforest-dependent households and the national economy.Macro policy reforms can change access to and use of for-est resources, affecting their economic contribution andthe quality and quantity of forests. A cost-effective moni- toring system may have to combine spatial monitoring ofthe biophysical resource with periodic reviews of statisticalinformation. FUTURE PRIORITIES AND SCALING-UP ACTIVITIES Developing good practice for identifying cross-sectoral impacts will revolve primarily around two subjects: (i) rec-ognizing that many situations involving macroeconomic reform are not win-win and that there is a need to analyze tradeoffs and engage in a process that involves all stakehold-ers in determining the appropriate balance between con-flicting objectives; and (ii) determining what might be doneto improve knowledge about interactions between specific types of macroeconomic and cross-sectoral activities.Important to both is the need to further strengthen collab-oration among sectors and between forest sector specialistsand macroeconomists, both within countries and in devel-opment institutions. 208 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGCommunity Forest Enterprises (CFE) in Mexico are widely known to be a product of institutionalarrangements that decentralized forest manage- ment to ejidos (agrarian reform communities) and indigenous communities and enabled these groups to improve economic well-being throughsustainable commercial use of forests. Recent worksuggests that the transfer of natural assets to com- munities through an agrarian reform process laidthe territorial and governance foundation for theestablishment of a large community forest sector(Bray et al. 2005). It is argued that in Mexico theagrarian reform laws have been crucial in creatinga larger number of CFEs than did specific forest legislation. Agrarian reform distributed forest lands to communities and provided a template forcommunity governance that could later serve as aninstitutional platform for the development ofCFEs (Bray et al. 2005). Source: Authors' compilation.Box 6.3 Positive Impact of Agrarian Reform on Community Forestry in MexicoImmediate measures Identify priority countries based on anticipated policy interventions. Donor agencies and concerned stakeholders should identify countries, lending situations, and prior conditions that suggest forests may be vulnerable to policy reforms and related activities. For institutions suchas the World Bank, the results of this analysis can be helpfulduring preparation of country assistance strategies, forestsector investments, and specific policy loans, to prioritize the specific programs and country situations where eco-nomic and sector work on potential impacts will be neededmost. For example, if there are regional trends in macro pol-icy reform (such as the trade agreement in Central Amer-ica), it would be important to focus the analytical work on this change. An indexing system based on relevant data and the DPL pipeline can be used to identify the countries andsituations where more needs to be known about prior con-ditions surrounding forests and forest people (see note 6.3,Identifying the Need for Analysis on Forests in Develop-ment Policy Reforms). This information would then be con-veyed to appropriate departments and other networks indevelopment organization involved in preparing the policyintervention, and further activities planned accordingly. Medium-term measures Conduct necessary analytical work on cross-sectoral and macroeconomic impacts. Analytical work should focus on identifying opportu nities for policy loans to bring about significant improvements in the benefits flowing from forests for poverty alleviation, sustainable economicgrowth, and the global public goods aspects of forests, andminimize unintended negative consequences. The World Bank's DPL policy paper (World Bank 2005) outlines a five-year program of implementation of environ- mental analytical work to support DPL operations. Thisincludes CEAs and SEAs or other appropriate analyticalwork in countries where (i) DPL volume is large, (ii) adjust-ment lending makes up a large share of country GDP , or (iii) reforms are proposed in environmentally sensitive sectors such as forests, agriculture, natural resources, energy, min-ing, transport, and water supply and sanitation (OPCS2004; Mani 2004). Adapt analytical tools for due diligence for forests. CEAs and SEAs are seen as appropriate instru- ments for assessing the effects of development policy oper-ations on the environment. However, some variations intheir design and resource allocation may be required forthem to effectively identify situations where policy interven- tions have significant potential to have an impact on forests and forest people and then for implementation of the nec-essary upstream analyses (see note 6.4, Assessing Cross-Sec-toral Impacts). \"Rapid CEAs\" are already evolving in some areas of oper- ations in the World Bank, and have value as a means for duediligence for forests, natural resources, and the environ-ment. The Rapid CEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina (see box6.4) proposes to use both historical data on the performanceof previous structural adjustment operations in the area ofenvironmental impacts, and recent environmental plans, toquickly identify which policies and sectors supported by thedevelopment policy credits pose significant risks to theenvironment, forests, and natural resources. This wouldappear to be precisely the objective of due diligence in thesecircumstances. Design analytical studies to inform policy processes, such as Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, NFPs, Country Assistance Strategy Development, PolicyLending, and Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits.Development practitioners need a detailed understandingof national policy processes before designing analyticalstudies on cross-sectoral impacts or impacts of macroeco- nomic reform on forests. The studies should, in addition tousing rigorous analytical tools and reliable data, involve keystakeholders (see box 6.2) in an effort to enhance acceptanceof the findings. Summarizing an approach for the World Bank. Main- streaming forest considerations requires due diligence on forests with regard to cross-sectoral impacts, given the mul- tiple objectives of the forest strategy, and the potentialimportance of forest outcomes for larger economic devel-opment and poverty alleviation objectives embodied inWorld Bank DPL and related lending. A sequence of activi-ties should be followed to develop the capacity of WorldBank staff to identify and deal with situations in which sig- nificant forest impacts from broad economic reform lend- ing are possible: 1. The Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Net- work, the Sustainable Development Network, and the Development Research Group should undertake an initialevaluation of forest significance in countries where DPLsor large-scale, cross-sectoral activities are ongoing orplanned, using the methodology outlined in note 6.3,Identifying the Need for Analysis on Forests in Develop- CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNING 209ment Policy Reforms. This will provide an initial \"watch list\" of countries for which further exploration of thepotential impacts of programmatic lending on forests is necessary. This list should be updated using information and methodologies outlined in note 6.4, Assessing Cross-Sectoral Impacts, as these become available; for example,better information on the numbers of poor people livingin or near forests, and their level of dependency on those forests, will be highly relevant. 2. As countries and situations are identified as being of interest in this regard, country teams and managers, incooperation with the Sustainable Development Networkand the Development Research Group, should examine the scheduling and content of forthcoming Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), CEA, and SEA activities todetermine whether these can and should be rationalizedto allow focused forest impact analysis to be carried outunder their auspices. 3. Even if this adaptation of policy instruments is not immediately possible, in countries and situations identi-fied in step 1, DPL task managers should work with the networks on an initial assessment of whether the specificmacroeconomic or broad cross-sectoral reforms intended under the DPL are likely to have flow-through impacts on forests, and, if so, the likely scale and natureof these impacts. Initially, it may be necessary to usequalitative and approximation approaches, as discussedin note 6.2, Prospects for Using Policy Lending to Proac- tively Enable Forest Sector Reforms, until more precisemeans of estimating impacts are available. NOTES 1. Environment includes policies on environmental pro- tection, soil conservation, water resources management, nature and landscape protection, and protected areas and national parks 2. The line between these two broad groups of impact sources can sometimes blur in project cases, creating the phenomenon labeled \"Dutch Disease,\" in which exploitation 210 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGA World Bank workshop on CEA and SEA in January 2005 recognized that a rapid form of CEA should beexamined as one option for meeting the new provi- sions of Operational Policy 8.60 in Bosnia and Herze- govina. The core of the rapid CEA (RCEA) would be(i) prioritization of policies and sectors to be sup-ported by the Programmatic Development Policy Cred-its regarding environmental implications and risks; (ii) an assessment of state, government entity, and localcapabilities to mitigate negative effects; (iii) recom-mendations to fill key gaps; and (iv) a small set of rec-ommended key indicators to track progress. The RCEAwould be carried out in parallel with the final stages offiscal 2005 Programmatic Policy Structural Adjustment Credit preparation, and would be amenable to updating as needed in subsequent fiscal years. Background information: According to the National Environmental Action Plan, freshwater and air qualityin rural areas are in fairly good condition, but becausewastewater management, waste disposal, and industrialcontrols are generally below international norms, envi-ronmental risks are increasing. Bosnia and Herzegov-ina's goal of meeting the requirements of the environ-mental acquis communautaire of the European Unionmeans that considerable investment in both the tech- nology for pollution control and institutions for mon-itoring and compliance will be required. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) performed an Environmental Performance Review forBosnia and Herzegovina (UNECE 2004), which out-lined deficiencies and needs for improvements in thepolicy, legal, and institutional framework; public par- ticipation and access to information; water resourcesmanagement (including drinking water quality); landuse; agriculture and biodiversity; management of wastesites; and environmental aspects of tourism and energydevelopment. The RCEA will first \"look back\" to frame how past adjustment operations examined environmentalimplications. It will then \"look forward\" by building onthe National Environment Action Plan, the Environ-mental Performance Review, and other studies toquickly identify which policies and sectors supportedby the Programmatic Development Policy Credits posethe more significant risks to the environment, forests,and natural resources. New data will be collected byBank staff and consultants on specific privatizations,new government permit programs, and the like. Box 6.4 Use of the Rapid CEA Approach in Bosnia and Herzegovina Source: World Bank 2005.of or reforms in one sector provides the government with \"easy money\" and causes the government to lose control offiscal expenditure. Elements of the safeguard and analytical approaches for World Bank investment lending projects may apply to aspects of these cases. These situations, how-ever, will also have large secondary and tertiary impactsthroughout the economy that parallel those associated withmacroeconomic policy reforms. 3. Local Agenda 21 is a local-government-led, community- wide, and participatory effort to establish a comprehensive action strategy for environmental protection, economicprosperity and community well-being in the local jurisdic-tion or area. This requires the integration of planning andaction across economic, social, and environmental spheres.Key elements are full community participation, assessmentof current conditions, target setting for achieving specificgoals, monitoring, and reporting.

TIMESCALE OF IMPACTS OF ENERGY SECTOR REFORM ON FORESTS AND FOREST INDUSTRIES The NFP concept aims to promote forest sector reform and development as contributors to sus-tainable development and poverty alleviation (see box 6.5). It responds to global concerns about unsustain- able exploitation of forests and deforestation and wide-spread discontent with the outcomes of earlier concertedefforts by the international community 1to halt the destruc- tion of predominantly tropical forests. The NFP expands the focus beyond the tropics, reflecting the principle of shared responsibility for the success of sustainable develop- ment, as defined during the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development (UNCED) in 1992. The NFP refers to a process rather than a tangible pro- gram and operates on a set of procedural principles 2that define how the exercise needs to be conducted. Its elements,3 in turn, outline the scope of individual outputs\u2014that is, what is to be accomplished. The NFP principles determinethe concept's most characteristic features and underpin each country's sovereign entitlement to use its natural resources in a sustainable manner. While advocating donorcoordination in support of sustainable forest sector devel-opment, the concept nevertheless emphasizes country lead-ership in NFP implementation. This sets the NFP apart from previous initiatives, which had been widely criticizedfor being donor driven, unnecessarily top heavy, and lackingin country ownership. The World Bank's 2002 Forests Strategy calls expressly for a \"multisectoral approach that addresses cross-sectoral issues and takes into account the impacts of activities, poli- cies, and practices outside the sector on forests and peoplewho depend on forests for their livelihoods\"(World Bank2004: 2). This programmatic requirement fits seamlesslywith the NFP concept. Reflecting upon the specific useful-ness of the NFP concept for these ends, the Forests Strategyconcludes \"...the motivation and coordinating frameworkwill be based on a shared agenda for forests, so that allgroups are able to focus their inputs on the same basic setof objectives in the sector. In many countries this frame-w o r k w i l l b e p r o v i d e d b y e n h a n c e d N F P s \" ( W o r l d B a n k2004: 9). This applies particularly to the World Bank's statedobjective to build its forest sector interventions on blendedfinancing arrangements. The main objectives of the NFP are to introduce intersectoral planning approaches, involving all relevant partners, to resolve conflicts and generateeffective policies and programs to address problems; raise awareness and mobilize commitments at all levelsto address the issues related to sustainable forestry devel-opment; increase the efficiency and effectiveness of both publicand private actions for sustainable forestry development; foster local, national, regional, and international part-nerships; mobilize and organize national and (if necessary) inter-national resources and catalyze action to implement pro-grams and plans in a coordinated manner; and plan and implement how forests and the forestry sectorcould contribute to national and global initiatives, forexample, the Environmental Action Plans and the actions agreed upon to implement the Forest Principles, Chapter 11 of Agenda 21, and the Conventions on Bio-diversity, on Climate Change, and on Desertification. The NFP , by definition, aims for cross-sectoral main- streaming of forest issues. Such issues as livelihoods of forest-dependent people and their rights (particularlyrights of access and resource tenure and equitable benefitsharing) call for broad stakeholder participation in forestpolicy formulation and legal as well as institutional reform (see note 5.3, Strengthening Legal Frameworks in the Forest Sector). The NFP specifically addresses these issues andpromotes nonconfrontational and synergetic implementa-tion. The development (or, rather, the adaptation) ofUsing National Forest Programs to Mainstream Forest IssuesNOTE 6.1 214national standards based upon international and regional processes,4and the establishment and operation of inde- pendent certification systems on a national scale, providepractical examples of how the NFP can serve as a transmis- sion belt between the international policy dialogue andnational implementation. In a similar way, the World Bank's need for baseline information and impact assessments ofvarious kinds coincides with the need for systematic, struc- tured information management as part of the NFP forest sector review. NOTE 6.1: USING NATIONAL FOREST PROGRAMS TO MAINSTREAM FOREST ISSUES 215NFPs can help raise the national profile of forest issues and mainstream forests within the larger policy context,as seen in Uganda. In 1997, Uganda was the first coun- try to develop a poverty reduction strategy. During the NFP process, considerable effort was put into influenc-ing the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) andaligning the strategies for forest sector developmentwith its pillars. As a result, the current PEAP document outlines in some detail the sector's contributions to theeconomy, the problems it faces, its potential to help alle-viate poverty, and external influencing factors, such asland ownership, energy consumption, decentralization,and urbanization. It also makes reference to the NFPstrategic framework and is consistent with the forest sector's new institutional setting. In outlining forestry-poverty linkages, the NFP process analyzed significant amounts of data and com- missioned studies to show that: forests provide an estimated 850,000 jobs, mostly in the informal sector related to the collection ofdomestic fuelwood; incomes from the sale of nonwood forest productsare estimated at US$38 million per year, with poorhouseholds in forested areas earning up to US$75 to fill gaps in other income sources, such as labor and farm produce; more than 92 percent of Ugandans use fuelwood as their main or only source of energy, consuming 16million tons of firewood and 4 million tons of char- coal each year; forests provide free goods that poor households rely upon for shelter, food, and medicines and that act assafety nets in times of emergency and sudden eco- nomic shocks; and forests can provide a source of income and develop- ment for many communities through ecotourism(MWLE 2002). Using such findings in PEAP and NFP has raisedawareness among policy makers and the public about the importance of forestry to the wider economy. Thecurrent PEAP notes that forests provide an annual eco-nomic value of US$360 million (6 percent of GDP), ofwhich only US$112 million is captured in official statis-tics. It explains how trees (through fuelwood and char-coal) provide 90 percent of energy demands and areexpected to still contribute 75 percent in 2015. ThePEAP also describes the ecological services of forests: biodiversity, climate regulation, soil and water conser-vation, and nutrient recycling. PEAP forest-related priorities regarding enhanced implementation of the NFP include the following: increased support to the Forestry Inspection Divi- sion for sector oversight; promotion of private sector investment in privateforests through information and technical advice onforest management; permits to grow trees in central forest reserves with secure land and tree tenure; review of tax and other disincentives; continuedoperation of the Sawlog Grant Scheme and theestablishment of a Tree Fund in accordance with theNational Forestry and Tree Planting Act; increased support to District Forestry Services to provide forestry advisory services for private andcommunity forestry to establish woodlots and planted forests and manage natural forests; development of the National Tree Seed Centre and decentralized seed production; and identification of potential markets for ecologicalservices, such as carbon trading. As in any iterative process, priorities for the sector have changed since forestry was included in PEAP , as a result of a review undertaken in 2002. After three yearsof persistent lobbying, PEAP now regards forestry notonly as a sector, but as an \"urgent short-term priority\" for funding, which suggests that forestry could qualifyfor increased allocations.Box 6.5 NFP in Uganda Source: Adata et al. 2006; Geller and McConnell 2006. The NFP approach is flexible and can be adapted to a wide range of situations: National governments may use this framework for the formulation of their forestry sector plans. Decentralized government authorities, as well as othernational partners such as community-based organiza-tions, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector, may use it to plan and implement their activities in line with the national framework. Concerned international institutions may use it to har- monize their actions, strengthen their cooperation inforestry, and enhance the use of human and financial resources in an effective and efficient way. Subregional and regional organizations of different countries with the same interests can use this method-ological framework to formulate and implement actions together. OPERATIONAL ASPECTS The preparation and implementation of the national forest program is guided by a series of basic principles, as listed inbox 6.6. The application of these basic principles should be 216 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGSustainability of forest development. The main pur- pose of the NFP is to ensure the conservation and sustainable development of forest resources. National sovereignty and country leadership. NFPs are national initiatives for which the country mustassume full leadership and responsibility. Partnership. NFPs aim to bring together all stake- holders in a process to which they feel committed.The strength of this partnership will depend on its ability to draw upon the specific capacities of indi- vidual partners. Participation. In the NFP , issues, options, and the resulting policies, strategies, and programs are agreed upon through participatory decision making and consensus building among all interested partners. Holistic and intersectoral approach. NFP approaches forests as diverse ecosystems with interdependent elements in dynamic equilibrium producing a vari- ety of goods and services; forestry includes trees in rural areas; forestry is practiced within the contextof sustainable land management, environmentalstability, and social and economic development.Forest dwellers are also part of this ecosystem. A long-term iterative process. The NFP is a cyclic process that includes planning as well as implemen- tation, and monitoring and evaluation activities. It is also an iterative process that continually reflects changes in the environment and the acquisition ofnew knowledge even during implementation. Capacity building. Capacity building is an essential element of the NFP . Throughout the process, actions are taken to develop the planning and implementation capacity of the national institu-tions and other key actors with a view to decreasing dependence on external assistance when necessary. Policy and institutional reforms. A priority of the NFP is to ensure that the policy and institutional framework is conducive to sustainable forestry development. Reforms must address policy and institutional issues in a comprehensive mannerthat recognizes the interdependencies betweensectors. Consistency with the national policy framework and global initiatives. The NFP must link with national development plans and with regional and local strategies. They should be integrated in the land-use planning exercises at national and local levels andinto broader programs, such as EnvironmentalAction Plans and the actions to implementUNCED's Agenda 21 and related conventions and initiatives. Raising awareness. The NFP must raise the visibility of the forestry sector and its priority in national agendas. The full value of forests and trees must be recognized as should their contribution to social, economic, and environmental issues. National policy commitment. The national forest program must be backed by the long-term commit- ment of all national actors, particularly at political and decision-making levels. International commitment. The long-term commit- ment of the international community and its insti- tutions is essential. These bodies should respect the policies, strategies, and programs approved by the countries and adapt their own priorities to thecountry priorities.Box 6.6 Basic Principles of NFP Preparation and Implementation Source: FAO (http://www.nfp-facility.org/forestry/site/31811/en/).adapted to the specific national context (political, social, economic, environmental) of the country concerned. There is no blueprint for launching an NFP\u2014the process may embark from various entry points, depending on which problem or development goals are perceived as thehighest priority. Designing and conducting an NFP involvesfour main phases: (i) organization of the process, (ii) strate-gic sector planning, (iii) program implementation, and (iv) revision and updating. NFP implementation is character-ized by a sequence of management and learning cycles. Organization of the process. This first phase includes identification of all stakeholders in the forestry and related sectors, organization of coordination mechanisms, anddevelopment of a communication strategy to ensure trans-parency of the process and full participation by all actors.Partners in the process should include national partners and,where relevant, international partners. The national partnersmay include national- and subnational-level governmentalinstitutions from the forestry sector and other sectors; train-ing and research institutions; NGOs involved in develop-ment and community-based organizations;private interests; and user groups (including rural commu-nities, farmers, settlers and Indigenous Peoples and otherforest dwellers, private enterprises, and associations). Inter- national partners may include intergovernmental agenciesand development banks, bilateral agencies, and interna-tional NGOs. The coordination mechanism helps stimulate, lead, and monitor the NFP . Existing coordination mechanisms shouldbe used. If necessary, existing mechanisms could beimproved and strengthened through a capacity-buildingprogram. A communication strategy should be developed asearly as possible to ensure that all stakeholders are informedabout the process and its results and can participate in allphases. Strategic planning. The second phase includes an evalu- ation of the current situation in the sector, identification of major problems, and possible immediate actions (see box6.7). It also includes an in-depth sector analysis, strategicanalyses, and formulation of the NFP . The strategic plan-ning is aimed at the following: making the case for public investment in the forestry sector; identifying constraints, problems, and opportunities forforestry development in a cross-sectoral context; identifying and assessing development options; establishing sectoral goals and objectives, the long-termdevelopment strategy (20-25 years), and the overall pro-gram structure in the short term (5-10 years); and improving national capacity in policy formulation andsectoral planning. Strategic planning choices should be a combination of professional analytical work and the result of public consul- tations through seminars, workshops, and other mecha-nisms that foster the involvement of all stakeholders. T oensure compatibility, strategic planning must be carried out within the broader context of the national planning frame-work and ongoing global initiatives. NOTE 6.1: USING NATIONAL FOREST PROGRAMS TO MAINSTREAM FOREST ISSUES 217Some recurring issues in forest sector reviews include the following: the need for policy, legislative, and institutionalreforms; the assessment of the forestry resource and itseconomic potential (wood products, fuelwoodand energy, nonwood products, and nonmone- tary benefits) including such issues as demand and supply, trade, market prices and fluctua-tions, substitutes, and various other externalfactors; conservation needs and potential, including such issues as the need to develop a network ofconservation areas, the protection of endan- gered species, biodiversity management in pro- duction forests, watershed restoration and pro-tection, and soil conservation; the social functions of the forests, including such issues as employment generation, contri-bution to the local subsistence economy, cul- tural functions, special needs of indigenous groups, and benefit sharing; and the assessment of the environmental impact of forest management, wood production, indus-trial operations and trade, wildlife management and forest clearing, shifting cultivation, fuel- wood collection, and extraction of other forestproducts. Source: FAO (http://www.nfp-facility.org/forestry/site/ 31811/en/).Box 6.7 Recurring Key Issues in Forest Sector ReviewsImplementation. The implementation of specific pro- grams, activities, and projects is the responsibility of the national implementing actors with the support of external agencies when needed in the third phase of the NFP process. Implementation should be coordinated and closely moni-tored. The coordinating entity should also monitor. Thisphase may involve policy, legal, and institutional reformsand the implementation of financing strategies (including enhanced revenue collection). It will also involve provisionof support to stakeholder organizations and the facilitationof partnerships for joint implementation. This phase isexpected to increase stakeholder capacity and produce part-nership agreements (such as sector-wide approaches; see box 6.8 on the use of this tool in Vietnam) and increase transparency and commitment. Revision and update. The fourth phase of the NFP involves revising and updating. This requires selecting issues for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and defining M&Ecriteria and indicators, followed by participatory monitor-ing and assessment of M&E results. The evaluation of NFPimplementation should: review the relevance of the program targets and objec- tives in relation to changing conditions; provide information on its impact, for example, theextent to which program implementation has resolvedfundamental problems, such as deforestation, wood and nonwood product supply, and reforestation, and gener-ated forestry sector contributions to social and economicdevelopment at various levels; assess the level of integration of the program with national development plans and its contribution tomeeting national development goals; assess changes in policy, policy instruments, and theimpact of institutional strengthening; assess environmental impact and the contribution ofNFP-generated activities to global environmental issues; assess the contribution of the program to sustainabledevelopment; quantify the changes in activity in the forestry sector andtheir contribution to the national economy; appraise the involvement and performance of all part-ners, national and international, with regard to originalcommitments; and assess the efficiency and effectiveness of communicationsand information between all partners (national andinternational) (FAO http://www.nfp-facility.org/ forestry/site/31811/en/). Before updating the NFP , changes in country context should also be noted. The new NFP should follow the same process as the original program\u2014the NFP is a cyclic process. 218 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGVarious developed countries promoted NFP processes in cooperation with developing countries (the Six-Country Initiative in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests/Intergovernmental Forum on Forests (IPF/IFF) process, for instance) to gain first-handexperience, emphasize the concept's relevance beyondtropical forests and developing countries, and under-line their commitment to shared responsibility in pro- tecting the world's forest resources through sustainablemanagement. In Vietnam, forest sector development isguided by the Five Million Hectares Reforestation Pro-gram (5MHRP), which runs until 2010. Aiming tofacilitate implementation, the international commu-nity has provided support through the Forest Sector Support Program (FSSP) since 2001. T o this end, more than 20 donor agencies and NGOs pooled and coordi-nated their contributions with the Vietnamese govern-ment by way of a sector-wide approach. The FSSPseeks to actively involve all major stakeholders (includ- ing rural communities), addresses access and manage-ment rights and benefit sharing, and promotes sustain- able forest management. Its operation is based upon a common work plan (which defines nine fields ofaction and applies agreed upon standards, set forth ina forest sector manual) as well as a multidonor forestfund. With a view to ensuring efficiency, effectiveness, complementarity, and poverty-orientation of thedonors' activities, a joint M&E system was established,and common supervisory bodies (FSSP PartnershipGroup, technical committee) installed. By launchingthe FSSP , the original preoccupation of the 5MHRPwith large-scale afforestation was reoriented toward sustainable forest management, poverty alleviation, and a more holistic approach to forest sector develop-ment. A constructive multistakeholder dialogue wassuccessfully initiated and maintained.Box 5MHRP: An Example of Success Source: Sepp 2006.Learning and sharing. Another operational aspect that warrants close attention is commonly referred to as learning and sharing. It includes progress reporting and systematic documentation and sharing of lessons learned in interna- tional and regional contexts. Countries implementing the NFP concept are expected to report regularly to international forums (such as the UnitedNations Forum on Forests (UNFF) or the Committee on Forestry (COFO) of the FAO, or to regional frameworks, suchas the Central African Forest Commission, the Amazon Coop-eration Treaty Organization, or the Association of SoutheastAsian Nations). Likewise, various donor organizations\u2014including the World Bank and the FAO, among others\u2014have undertaken to compile, assess, document, and share informa- tion about NFP implementation in various countries and set-tings, drawing on information furnished by individual partnercountries. This process has recently been institutionalizedthrough establishment of international and regional commu-nities of practice. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS Several attempts have been made recently to gauge the progress made in NFP implementation. Such undertakingshave drawn on reports furnished by participating countries as well as upon feedback provided by numerous interna- tional experts and national practitioners alike, mostly in con-nection with high-level meetings of the UNFF or regionalconferences and workshops (such as a UNFF-4 side event onachievement of the UNFF Plan of Action through NFPs). The NFP can raise profile of forest sector. Past experi- ence suggests that the NFP concept has been highly successful in raising the forest sector's political status in many countries.Awareness of the multiple functions and values of forests hasimproved markedly, as have participatory implementationand civil society and private sector involvement in forest sec-tor development. In numerous countries, policy, legal, andinstitutional reforms (often including such cross-cuttingissues as decentralization and devolution of administrativeauthority and land rights and resource tenure) have been suc-cessfully initiated (see chapter 5, Improving Forest Gover-nance; note 5.1, Decentralized Forest Management; and note5.3, Strengthening Legal Frameworks in the Forest Sector). Challenges and factors important for success. A number of challenges and crucial success factors have been identified:There needs to be clear understanding and agreement among all stakeholders about the priority issues to beaddressed in the course of the NFP . T o ensure lasting commitment, equitable access to infor-mation and broad participation in discussion and deci-sion making and the establishment of a focal point or secretariat as a clearinghouse structure and impartial moderator should be considered. Equitable participation hinges on identification of key stakeholder groups, support to stakeholder self-organization, and capacity building; communication and participation must be kept transparent and noncon- frontational. Cross-sectoral environmental and social assessments must be included in the NFP's analysis stage; adequatetools and techniques for data collection and assessment of information need to be communicated and applied. From the outset, macro policies and issues related to structural adjustment (for example, PRSPs) need to beintegrated in strategic planning and decision making. Donor coordination should be promoted through part-nership approaches and agreements\u2014this also helps toensure that the partner country's domestic resources are pooled and used in a transparent and efficient manner. Financing strategies need to coordinate and combine various types of financing instruments and sources offunding (donors, public budget, private sector, civil soci- ety) in the pursuit of sustainable forest sector develop- ment. Forest sector investment must be coordinated withcommonly agreed upon goals and priorities; hence con-stituting a core area of discussion for overall strategydevelopment and policy formulation. Science and research, professional education facilities, and public information services need to be included inthe NFP with a view to ensuring systematic analysis and rationalized decision making, building management capacity, and promoting public discussion and awarenessabout the environmental and socioeconomic signifi-cance of forests and their sustainable use. NFP implementation needs to be monitored on a con- tinuous basis. Because of the lengthy process, donorcoordination should aim to ensure that assistance to for- est sector development is provided on a continuous basis. One additional, crucial lesson learned so far is the need for qualitative performance criteria, whereby the overall effectiveness and conformity of individual NFPs could begauged. Such criteria would have to be sufficiently broad to NOTE 6.1: USING NATIONAL FOREST PROGRAMS TO MAINSTREAM FOREST ISSUES 219allow for each country's different environmental, economic, and sociopolitical settings, while at the same time enablingobjective summary conclusions about the NFP concept's progress and impact.

Note 5.1, Decentralized Forest Management, and 5.3, Strengthening Legal Frameworks in the Forest Sector. 220 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGAt first glance, policy lending instruments (for example, DPLs and poverty reduction supportcredits [PRSCs]) seem well-suited to achieving basic reforms in forests. Forests, like all natural resources, are public goods and need to be managed in the interests of localpeople, the country, and the global environment. Effectivemanagement of forest resources involves difficult choicesand reforms ranging from reshaping and enforcing taxation regimes (see note 5.4, Strengthening Fiscal Systems in theForest Sector), curbing illegal logging (see note 5.5, Address-ing Illegal Logging and Other Forest Crime), restoring thetraditional rights of local populations (see chapter 12, Apply-ing OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples), closing down paras- tatals, and reforming institutions (see note 5.2, Reforming Forest Institutions). Despite this, there are mixed opinions in the World Bank on the effectiveness of using policy loans (versus investmentloans) to address sectoral reforms in forest sector. There is nocurrent consistent case evidence from Bank activities to sup-port an unambiguous conclusion on this matter. This notepresents key principles to consider when addressing forestsector reform through Development Policy Lending (DPL). OPERATIONAL ASPECTS Coordination between analytical and lending activ- ities. Independent of whether a policy lending instrument1 is used to address forest sector reform, upstream analyticalwork, the development policy loan, and sectoral invest-ments need to be coordinated so as to make the best use of the capacities of each of these instruments to bring about needed changes (see box 6.9). 2Such coordination is espe- cially critical where forests are both significant (important for economic revenue, poverty alleviation, and environmen- tal services) and vulnerable to cross-sectoral impacts. Upstream analysis is a way to improve the World Bank'sability to identify the appropriate sectoral reforms (or pri- orities) and, where relevant, anticipate and address poten-tially adverse forest impacts resulting from key sectoral andcross-sectoral macro policy reforms. This requires alloca-tion of human and financial resources. In addition, it isimportant to integrate upstream analysis into ongoing workfor PRSPs, CASs, and other Bank activities. Development policy loans are usually issued in a single tranche, and consist of quick-disbursing assistance that can help restore balance of payments equilibria (and as such, are 221Prospects for Using Policy Lending to Proactively Enable Forest Sector ReformsNOTE 6.2 In an environmental structural adjustment opera- tion in Mexico (Mexico Environmental StructuralAdjustment Loan [ENVSAL] fiscal 2004), the objective was to mainstream environmental issues into key economic sectors. The policy loan wasseen as effective in achieving its objective. Itinvolved establishing a functioning intersectoraltechnical working group for each of the key sectors (water, energy, forestry, and tourism). TheENVSAL complemented investment loans thatwere focused on specific sectors. In the case offorestry, it was linked with the investment loan oncommunity forestry and focused on complemen-tary policy measures and fiscal instruments to enhance sustainability and betterment of liveli- hoods. A shortcoming of the Mexico ENVSAL isthat the number of conditionalities was high andthe triggers covered a broad range of developmen-tal areas, which raised supervision and transactioncosts significantly. Source: Authors' compilation.Box 6.9 Mexico Environmental SAL: Making It Worklimited in the coverage and duration they can devote to sec- toral reforms). They can also be designed as multiyear, mul-titranche operations that support sector-wide assistance programs in response to government requests when appro- priate, and are associated with different types of condition-ality (see box 6.10 and box 6.11). The good practice principles proposed by the World Bank 2005 Conditionality Review are relevant for strong policy operations aiming to achieve forest sector reforms.These principles are reviewed in the following paragraphs: Ownership. Success of sector policy reforms depends heavily on the ownership and institutional capacity of the agencies responsible for implementing the reforms. A realistic assess-ment of ownership must rely on the government's expressedpolicy intentions and its track record of reform. The nature ofpolicy loans requires separating the reforms from the stake-holders responsible for implementation. Perspectives divergeon the implication of this for the utility of DPL for sectoralreforms. With DPLs, sector reforms often must be initiated and owned by central economic and policy ministries, thusbroadening the group of agencies responsible for reform.Furthermore, policy loans can be more effective because dis-bursements are triggered by the delivery of tangible andmeasurable results. This can be an important incentive in achieving sectoral reforms that might not come to fruitionunder sector investment lending because of institutional iner- tia and unwillingness to venture into reform areas in the implementing agencies themselves (see boxes 6.11). Separating reforms from the stakeholders responsible runs the risk of a disconnect between reform and imple-mentation at the sector level, especially in cases where very specific sectoral objectives have been included in the DPLpackage. For example, in some countries energy sectorreforms have been included in a series of DPLs over severalyears, with little impact on the sector program. When usingDPLs for sectoral reforms, it can also be unclear where the funds required for costs of implementing triggers or prior actions for subsequent loans will be raised. Harmonization. Under the lead of country authorities, World Bank staff should reach an understanding with the government and other partners on a single and internallycoherent framework for measuring progress under the gov-ernment's program. These accountability frameworks are setout as policy matrices showing policy actions and expectedresults. These frameworks can serve to coordinate broader do -nor support, including technical assistance. Accountability 222 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGPolicy based loans are made available when the bor- rower accomplishes critical policy and institutionalactions, or loan conditions. Actions to be met before an operation can be approved by the Board are referred to as prior actions and are listed in a schedule to the legal agreement, and all conditions for single-tranche oper-ations are prior actions. In an operation with morethan one tranche, the borrower complies with certain conditions after Board approval and effectiveness (inaddition to any prior actions), termed tranche-release conditions. Unless all tranche-release conditions are met, a tranche can be released only if the Boardapproves a waiver of the unmet conditions. In addition to the critical policy and institutional actions that are recorded as prior actions or tranche-release conditions in legal agreements, the World Bankuses triggers and benchmarks to review and describe progress under a programmatic series of loans. Triggers represent critical actions for achieving andsustaining the results of the medium-term program.Achievement of triggers normally indicates suffi-cient progress to move from one operation to thenext. Triggers offer greater operational flexibilitythan using tranche-release conditions, because trig-gers can be adapted more easily to a changing pro-gram environment. Bank operations are expected todescribe how triggers are adapted and modified tosupport program objectives before being convertedinto the prior actions of a follow-on operation. Benchmarks in program matrices describe the con- tents and results of the government's program in areas supported by the World Bank. Benchmarks are frequently used to describe steps in a reform process that represent significant, though not neces-sarily critical, progress markers for the implementa-tion of the program. Although they help define anarea of the Bank's policy involvement, they are not intended to determine disbursement of Bank loansor grants.Box 6.10 Typology of Conditionality Source: World Bank 2005. frameworks can be used flexibly to achieve different levels of coordination, responding to country circumstances. Customization. The accountability framework should be consistent with the government's expressed policy inten- tions and internal accountability mechanisms. The frame-work should not be used to add policy actions to the gov-ernment's agenda. Several programs support reforms that are politically sensitive and require the government to makehard choices about reform. The program measures are usu- ally derived from a government-led process of reform andthe reform measures should be linked to an important objective in the government strategy document. Prioritization of critical actions. In establishing the conditions for lending, World Bank and country staff should choose from the agreed accountability framework policy and institutional actions that are critical for achieving the NOTE 6.2: PROSPECTS FOR USING POLICY LENDING TO PROACTIVELY ENABLE FOREST SECTOR REFORMS 223The fifth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-5) for Ghana is the second in a series of annual operationssupporting the implementation of the Ghana Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II) covering the period 2006-09, in line with the 2004 CAS and the2006 CAS Progress Report. This proposed operationwill focus on three broad components of the newpoverty reduction agenda organized under (i) acceler- ated private sector-led growth, (ii) vigorous humanresource development, and (iii) good governance andcivic responsibility. While the PRSC-5 support wouldtranslate primarily into funding for the implementa-tion of the GPRS II, the PRSC-5 also focuses on cross-cutting issues related to private sector development and the strengthening of institutions related to gover- nance, public sector reform, decentralization, and pub-lic financial management. The first component of the proposed PRSC-5 reflects the objectives of the first pillar of the GPRS II,focusing on actions aimed at accelerating sustainableprivate sector-led growth. This first component alsosupports measures to improve the performance of therural sector through policy actions aimed at strength-ening government support to agriculture, and atimproving the management of natural resources with afocus on forestry resources. A forest condition was included as a prior action for PRSC-5. The proposed prior action was \"conducting an inventory of plantation forests and providing theneeded information for two auctions of timber utiliza-tion contracts in 2006.\" The inventory of plantationforests was carried out in early 2006, covering an areaof 2,000 sq km, and provided the information neededto calculate the timber right fees (TRF) that were usedto determine the value of the Timber Utilization Con-tracts (TUCs). Based on this information, a competi-tive bid on plantation timber resources was conducted in April. The introduction of new policies for managing forestry resources, such as the conversion from timber area leases to timber utilization contracts, has provento be much slower than expected. There have beendelays in carrying out the inventory of trees in areaseligible for conversion, which are needed to calculate the TRFs that will, in turn, be used to determine thevalue of the TUCs. These inventories are time-con-suming and expensive, making them difficult to carryout, especially given the lower-than-expected revenuescoming from internally generated funds. Most of theinternally generated funds for the Forestry Commis- sion (around 50 percent) are derived from the export levy on timber, which was challenged in court by tim-ber exporting companies. The inventory of plantation forests carried out in early 2006 provided the required information for at leastone TUC auction, completed in April that year. Theinventory and auction implemented by the ForestryCommission should not detract from the fact that thebudget execution rate of the Forestry Commission in2006 was lower than in 2005, falling to 45 percent, downfrom 69 percent. The forthcoming PRSC-6 operation,therefore, has a trigger that supports the government'sprogram to have in place a cabinet-approved financial framework Forestry Commission in 2007. This financialframework aims to ensure (i) that the forest revenues andthe budget of the Forestry Commission are released intime to conduct its core functions; (ii) transparency andaccountability in financial management, includingbudget execution; and (iii) the collection and distribu-tion of revenue to stakeholders. In doing so, it expects tohelp ensure predictability of financing and allow thebudget execution rate to increase. Box 6.11 Conditions in Development Policy Loans on Forestry: An Example from Ghana Source: Authors' compilation using World Bank 2007a. 224 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGIn November 2005, the World Bank approved a US$15 million IBRD Natural Resources development policyloan to help Gabon design and implement reforms in the forest, fisheries, biodiversity and environment, mining, and oil sectors. In February 2006, it approveda US$35 million Forest and Environment developmentpolicy grant to help Cameroon consolidate and scaleup recent sector reforms. Both operations represent World Bank contributions to national sector programssupported by multiple donors\u2014the Cameroon grant isa joint IDA-Global Environment Fund (GEF) opera-tion, while the Gabon development policy loan is anIBRD loan to be complemented by a parallel GEFgrant. Forests, biodiversity, and other natural resources are critical to rural livelihoods in both countries, where themajority of people live in extreme poverty. They arealso central to economic development and stability,and are the focus of a number of international part-nerships. While adapted to fit their specific countrycontexts, both operations focus on reforming sectorincentive frameworks, improving governance, enhanc-ing participation, and enforcing laws and regulationsin the field. Their design is based on several principles:that natural resources are public goods to be managedin the interests of local people, the country, and theglobal environment; that sustainable forest manage- ment and fiscal and environmental responsibility mustbe integrated into the business model of the forestindustry; and that government must assume fullresponsibility for the quality of management of theassets under its stewardship. Well-designed, comprehensive forest operations tend to involve difficult choices and reforms rangingfrom reshaping and enforcing taxation regimes, curb-ing illegal logging, restoring the traditional rights oflocal populations, closing down parastatals, overcom-ing inertia, and reforming institutions. Two decades ofBank experience in providing assistance to the forestsector in Cameroon and Gabon revealed clearly thelimits of traditional projects (called Sector InvestmentLoans, or SILs by the World Bank) in reforming forestsectors traditionally dominated by political patronageand vested interests. It also indicated that more suc-cessful reform programs can be pursued through sec-tor-wide structural adjustments, if the programs aresufficiently broad, and endowed with flexible timeframes and adequate resources for supervision. A number of considerations led the World Bank to select DPL as the instrument for the new Cameroon and Gabon operations: DPLs directly involve central economic ministries,engaging high-level authorities to support funda-mental changes in policy and its implementation. SILs, however, are often limited to sector ministries in which narrower interests tend to guard the statusquo, leaving necessary policy changes in the handsof those most resistant to change. DPL disbursements are triggered by the delivery of tangible and measurable results, whereas SIL pro-ceeds are used to reimburse eligible expenditures incurred by the client. SILs are based on the assumption that a strong direct link exists betweenexpenditures and results, while DPLs focus moredirectly and uncompromisingly on results. DPL dis-bursements are far fewer in number and involve much larger amounts than SIL disbursements, mak-ing them significant to heads of state and centraleconomic authorities who would otherwise likelyoverlook forest-related issues. DPL places a strong emphasis on defining results clearly and measuring achievements objectively,because these are at the core of legal agreements and key to World Bank loan and grant disbursements. This focus on results facilitates donor alignmentand harmonization, joint donor supervision, publicscrutiny, and independent monitoring. For example, the joint adoption of the results matrix negotiated in the course of the preparation of the Cameroon Forest and Environment development pol-icy loan, encouraged Canada, Germany, France, theNetherlands, the United Kingdom, the EuropeanUnion, the African Development Bank, the World Bank, the FAO, the United Nations Development Pro- gramme (UNDP), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF),and the Netherlands Development Organization(SNV), to sign a partnership agreement that provides aclear framework for aligning their support to the forestsector. DPLs sharpen the focus of Bank-government dia- logue on the achievement of larger results and thequality of processes. Dialogue surrounding SILs tends to revolve around individual procurementBox 6.12 The Use of DPLs to Support Natural Resources Management in Gabon and Cameroonresults of the program. Managing the size of program matrices is challenging, especially in harmonized donor set-tings, with different outcomes in different countries. Transparency and predictability. In the context of medium-term World Bank support, progress should be reviewed regularly and in line with a country's M&E cycle,drawing to the extent possible on internal accountabilityprocesses. It is equally important to be explicit about condi- tions, triggers, and expected results. In a programmaticseries, it is possible to integrate a review of results into the next operation (see box 6.14). Aligning these reviews with government budget cycles is preferable. Monitoring impacts. An immediate challenge facing the World Bank and other institutions engaged in operations at NOTE 6.2: PROSPECTS FOR USING POLICY LENDING TO PROACTIVELY ENABLE FOREST SECTOR REFORMS 225and financial transactions, leaving less time and fewer supervision resources for the operation'slarger objectives and the underlying structural con- straints that may be hindering procurement and disbursement processes. By providing for intermin-isterial review of the results that disbursements aredirectly contingent upon, and requiring periodicaudits of fiduciary processes, DPLs can more effec- tively and purposefully bring structural improve-ments to procurement and disbursement. While DPLs are usually used as single tranche, quick-disbursing operations that can help budgetsupport geared toward domestic financing needs, they can also be designed as multiyear, multi- tranche operations that support sector-wide assis-tance programs in response to government requestswhen appropriate. The timeframe for disbursementin the Cameroon and Gabon DPLs is comparable to those of SILs. DPL components can be tailored according to Bank fiduciary concerns in a specific country, and be usedto monitor compliance with the enhanced procure- ment and financial practices that have been previ- ously agreed to with the World Bank in the contextof its major assessments of the country's financialaccounting, administrative, and procurement pro-cedures. The Cameroon and Gabon DPLs include agreements that the government will use dedicatedaccounts for monitoring relevant resource flows,conduct external audits, and share the results withthe World Bank, and use technical assistance asneeded to improve procurement and financial man-agement. DPLs afford adequate flexibility to address any likely significant environmental and social issuesappropriately. While DPLs do not trigger World Bank safeguard policies, OP8.60 requires that theBank determine whether policies it supports haveany likely significant effect on the environment,natural resources, or forests, or any likely signifi-cant poverty and social impact. If there are anysuch likely significant effects, the World Bank needs to ascertain whether it has a clear understanding ofhow negative effects can be reduced or positiveones enhanced through the borrower's systems,drawing on relevant country-level or sectoral envi-ronmental and social analysis. Carrying out duediligence in the Cameroon and Gabon DPLs andrelated GEF operations, the Bank teams advisedthe governments to conduct full SEAs. In the viewof World Bank staff, these assessments met thehighest standards, including those set by Banksafeguard policies, and allowed staff to concludethat likely significant effects of the supported poli-cies would be addressed appropriately during pro-gram implementation. Are forest development policy loans suitable to all situations? DPLs require particularly advanced policy dialogue on sector policy reforms and reform implementation.They can only be built upon strong collaboration between central economic and technical ministries, and in the presence of completed or unfolding nationalfinancial management, auditing, and procurementreforms. In the cases of Cameroon and Gabon, theseconditions were created through long processes of intersectoral dialogue with the government and strongcollaboration within the country team. Box 6.12 The Use of DPLs to Support Natural Resources Management in Gabon and Cameroon (continued) Source: T opa and Debroux 2006. the macroeconomic and larger cross-sectoral level will be to mainstream effective monitoring of forest outcomes intothese operations, where these are identified as being poten- tially significant. Successful and effective monitoring of for- est outcomes in policy lending operations will facilitate theimplementation of \"no fault\" and relatively inexpensivemonitoring of forest outcomes during implementation oflending operations. One of the primary uses of monitoring information on forest outcomes under development policylending will be to develop more quantitative and analyticalapproaches to projection of likely forest outcomes. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS DPL can facilitate sector reform. DPL has not been generally thought of within the World Bank as an instrumentfor specific sectoral reforms, yet it may in fact have more potential to effect the sort of fundamental changes in forestsector policy and practices than is available under tradi-tional sector investment lending. Ministries of Finance areinvolved in implementing policy loans, and the inclusion offorest sector reform considerations in a policy loan canfacilitate mainstreaming forest considerations into national policy dialogue and raise the profile of governance andinstitutional issues of concern in this sector. Prior policy dialogue. Development policy loans require particularly advanced policy dialogue on sector policy reforms and reform implementation. Such loans can onlybe built upon strong collaboration between central eco-nomic and technical ministries, and in the presence of com- 226 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGIn the Lao People's Democratic Republic, a natural resource management component under publicsector reform was incorporated into a structural adjustment operation (People's Democratic Republic of Lao Financial Management Adjust-ment Credit [FMAC], FY02). The overall objectiveof this component was to involve local communi-ties in the management of forests and improve leg- islation on conservation. The project was under thecontrol of the Minister of Finance, but the day-to-day implementation and monitoring was done by ahigh level interministerial coordination committee. For release of the second tranche, Lao PDR had to accomplish two forest sector-related actions. A quality-at-entry review suggested that the inclu- sion of reforms in forestry regulations unnecessar-ily broadened the scope of the conditions. Theobjectives of the natural resource managementsubcomponent were partially achieved, but localparticipation was less than envisaged partlybecause of capacity limitations and political resis-tance. The implementation completion reportstates that the legal framework has establishedtechnically sound forest management with basicprovisions for planning, mapping, consultation,and Source: Authors' compilation.Box 6.13 Using DPLs in Lao PDR for Advancing the Forest Sector Agenda The Republic of Armenia PRSC III is the third in a proposed series of four annual single tranchePRSCs intended to support policy and institu- tional reforms in furtherance of the government's PRSP . The PRSCs focus on four critical reformthemes: (i) consolidating macroeconomic disci-pline and strengthening governance, (ii) sharpen-ing competition and entrenching property rights, (iii) mitigating social and environmental risks, and(iv) modernizing the rural economy. Under thecomponent on Reducing Risks in NaturalResource Management, the action taken underPRSCs I and II included adopting a nationalforestry policy and forest code, outlining the insti- tutional restructuring plan for the sector, estab- lishing a pilot system for monitoring illegal forestexploitation, and promoting community forestmanagement. The Policy and Institutional ReformActions under PRSC III included controlling ille-gal logging within agreed targets, and expandingcommunity forest management. The trigger inPRSC II (as approved by the Board) was control-ling illegal logging and forest removal within tar-gets to be agreed with IDA by March 2006. As aresult of political factors, the proposals for thestructure, powers, and functioning of the illegallogging monitoring system were developed, but have not yet been adopted. The condition wasdeferred to PRSC IV . Source: Authors' compilation using World Bank 2007. Box 6.14 Transparency and Predictability: An Example from Armeniapleted or unfolding national financial management, audit- ing, and procurement reforms. In the cases of Cameroon and Gabon outlined in box 6.12, these conditions were created through long processes of intersectoral dialogue with the government and strongcollaboration within the country team. The results were notuniformly successful, and at times proved difficult and con-tentious, but some measure of reform was enabled by the process. This, however, needs to be viewed in a contextwhere, in this region, two decades of World Bank experiencein providing assistance via sector investment lending to theforest sector clearly revealed the limits of traditional sectorinvestment projects in reforming forest sectors traditionally dominated by political patronage and vested interests. Good governance as an entry point. Good governance is a strong entry point for sector reforms (see chapter 5, For- est Sector Governance, and associated notes). Linking forestsector governance reforms with a broader extractive indus-tries transparency initiative, or positioning them as part ofthe overall good public sector management effort (forexample, an anticorruption, transparency, or improved gov-ernance component) can strengthen its hold in a policyloan. Done this way, forest sector reform could be includedas a trigger or prior action, making the reform component binding and essential for release of a tranche. Avoid mixed results and signals. When a client is per- forming well in general, and has achieved all the prior actions for a policy reform loan except those associated withforests, a decision needs to be made on whether to withholdthe release of the tranche of one unfulfilled prior action. Insome cases, the World Bank has employed a floatingtranche, disbursable when particular conditions areexpected in some way to be difficult, or more drawn-outthan others in the policy matrix: the Cameroon structuraloperation is a case where this approach was applied to for-est outcomes. In other cases (see box 6.9), the nature of theoperation itself ensured that activities and measures under-taken complemented investment loans that were focused onspecific sectors. It is sometimes possible to transfer policyobjectives related to a single sector or related group of sec-tors into investment loans that are coordinated with DPLs,and can follow policy developments that are foreshadowedand perhaps initiated under a DPL, but require longer timeframes for implementation. 3 The primary requirement is that the World Bank remain internally consistent in its approach to dealing with forests and broader natural resource outcomes, in cases where theseare important. If a sector-specific condition has not been achieved by a well-performing client, it is important toidentify how to modify the condition rather than drop it.Natural resource and forest outcomes are not trivial adjunctsto economic reform objectives, but may play a significantrole in the successful achievement of those objectives. Analytical work should look at all influences on forests. The use of analytical work should be carefully con- sidered in the context of forests and DPLs. Essentially, whatis required here is a broad scoping exercise that examinesthe status of DPLs, proposed forest sector or larger naturalresource project activities, and other cross-sectoral develop-ments that are indicated in CASs and business plans. Sectorwork should not be based simply on problems within theforests sector, as perceived by forest agencies in the countryand the World Bank sector staff, but on a broader apprecia-tion of all influences and changes likely to affect forests, andan analysis of what combination of macroeconomic, cross-sectoral, and within-sector measures are likely to producethe best outcomes from national economic, environmental,and social perspectives. For forest outcome monitoring to be effective, the World Bank needs to undertake continuing research on how changes at the macroeconomic and broad cross-sectoral lev-els flow through the economic and social systems to mani-fest as impacts on forests. Ownership matters. Policy conditions in DPL, as in investment lending, are more likely to result in sector policy reform when there is clear borrower ownership, commit-ment, and demand at the sector level, and when the appro-priate central ministry (such as the Ministry of Finance) ispart of the dialogue and supports the agreements reached. NOTES 1. For this note, a policy lending instrument will be called a development policy loan. 2. For further information on the points raised in this sec- tion, please refer to World Bank (2006). 3. There is some risk attached to this strategy, in that a gov- ernment may successfully implement the DPL that fore- shadows further policy changes under investment lending but then decides not to proceed with those investment loans.

CROSS-REFERENCED CHAPTERS AND NOTES Chapter 5: Improving Forest Governance, and associated notes 228 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGThe combined impacts on forests of economic activities that originate outside the forest sectorare, in most cases, significantly greater than those produced by economic activity within the sector itself. Macroeconomic change will almost always be a majorcomponent of these external forces. Therefore, if forestsare a significant part of the economic and social resourcebase of a country, it will be necessary to consider such impacts when DPL, broadly based poverty alleviation pro-grams, and related programmatic activities are beingdesigned. Assessing causality is complicated. The impacts on forests and other natural resources of large-scale economic policy changes and reforms will manifest themselvesthrough a complex web of second- and third-round activi-ties and responses that will be triggered as illustrated in fig-ure 6.1 (World Bank 2005). Identifying the nature of theireventual impacts on forests\u2014or even whether there will besignificant impacts\u2014will not be straightforward: Prior eco-nomic, environmental, and social conditions will have amajor role in outcomes, and no general relationships ormodels to predict impact outcomes are, or are likely tobecome, available. 1Where forests are sufficiently important economically, or directly support the livelihoods of a large number of poor people, the impacts of broadly based growth could signifi- cantly compromise the broad goals of economic growth, poverty alleviation, and environmental sustainability ofmacro policy loans. Due diligence requires identification ofcases where this is a potential risk to the overall implemen-tation of the policy loan and making the necessary adjust- ments to program design. A dearth of data. There are currently relatively few com- prehensive data sets on cross-sectoral impacts or impacts of macroeconomic reform; this imposes a significant opera-tional constraint on development of good practice for man-aging the World Bank's engagement in this area. Good prac-tice will, therefore, initially largely be a matter of developingguidelines and approximation methodologies for identify-ing cases where there is significant potential for importantimpacts to occur, and then applying economic and sectorwork in a timely and focused manner to those situations.Linked to the latter, there is a need to develop acceptableapproaches and for the World Bank to adequately invest inassessing the potential impacts of particular economicchanges in which it is involved in specific countries. 229Identifying the Need for Analysis on Forests in Development Policy ReformsNOTE 6.3 Economic reform Fiscal reform Reduction in resources for environmental goodsand servicesReduction in Coverage of environmental issues\u007f Enforcement capacity\u007f Monitoring abilityAnticipated response Institutional linkages Environmental impact Deforestation Soil contamination Biodiversity lossFigure 6.1 Indirect Impact of Fiscal Reform on ForestsOPERATIONAL ASPECTS Prioritizing those circumstances in which forest sector ana- lytical work is important requires that countries and lend-ing situations with significant forest interests be identified. A potential approach would include identifying countries where forests are important (for economic development, poverty alleviation, ecosystemservices); identifying and screening the major macro policyreforms being proposed in each country; analyzing and developing, in the cases where the impactof the macro policy reform are directly or indirectly anissue, mechanisms for handling the cross-sectoral impacts; and identifying entry points for addressing the potential cross-sectoral impact. This stepwise approach to prioritizing where detailed analysis may be needed is necessary for two pragmatic rea- sons. First, the resources needed to implement field analysesoften will be limited; it is therefore unrealistic to propose ageneral application of analytical work to this task in all pos- sible cases. Second, because uncertainty will inevitably sur-round the analytical process itself, at least in the early stagesof application, it will be necessary to learn from and refineinitial approaches along the way. The actual approach can be applied at a regional or global level, depending on the need. The approach can alsobe applied at the national level and, as discussed in the fol-lowing section, will require modifying the method. Themain constraint to application of any approach is availabil-ity of data. Identifying countries where forests are important. A preliminary approach to identifying the countries and situa- tions where forests are important, from an economic andpoverty point of view as well as an environmental one,requires the development of appropriate indicator. A quanti-tative approach for the development of good practice could be initiated quickly following the approach in a recent study onpolicy loans and forest outcomes (World Bank 2005). Thiswould allow task managers to compile a watch list of countriesfor which cross-sectoral impacts on forests from program-matic activities will need to be further examined in the field. An index can be developed to identify where forests are important by characterizing forest significance. The forestsignificance index can be created using readily available dataon the following: Contribution of forests to the economy (using data on pro- duction of wood fuel and production of roundwood, both from the FAOSTAT online statistical services, 2004). This measure picks up an element of forest output beyond the conventional measure of commercial log-ging, that is, the large amount of fuelwood that is used bylocal communities and frequently does not enter formalmarkets. Forest-poverty linkage (using data on the annual rate of change between 1990 and 2001 in the percentage of poor living on less than a dollar a day, and the percentage of poverty in 1996. Both of these measures use the Poverty Calculator (POVCAL) approach developed by the WorldBank. It should be noted that the variable is a weak proxyfor what is of interest here\u2014some estimate of the preva-lence of poor people who live in or near forests and depend on them greatly\u2014but few alternatives are readily available. Forest-conservation linkage (using data on percentage of threatened bird species in 2000, percentage of threatened mammal species in 2000, and rate of change in forest cover over the period 1990-2000). These variables pro- vide some reflection of biodiversity loss, as well as a grossmeasure of forest loss. 2 A measure for forest-related governance was included in the index to assess where the prior conditions raise concerns about how cross-sectoral impacts are handled. This measure used data on the Rule of Law (which is a measure from Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi's [2004] corruption indi-cators) and presence of democratic institutions. These arewell-known and documented measures of governance.Their limitation as a proxy in this context is that they do not specifically reveal the state of governance in the forest sectoritself, nor do they shed any light on how that is influencedby broader trends in the economy. Each of the measures used in the index were weighted equally. The weighting can vary if the approach is to assist in examining a specific cross-sectoral impact (for example, impact of macro policy reform on the contribution offorests to poverty). 3 More sophisticated vulnerability indicators can be devel- oped to capture countries' performance in political and resource risks, policy and institutional failures (particularly in the resource sectors), weak regulation and implementa- tion capacity, and lack of monitoring and enforcement.There is some merit to considering broadening the coverageof environmental policy and institutions in the existingCountry Policy and Institutional Assessment index (used currently for IDA fund allocations). This could serve as a 230 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGuseful first cut in understanding country capacity in regu- lating the environment. Identifying and screening macro policy reforms. The second part of the task of identifying and prioritizing situa- tions where more intensive due diligence on forest outcomesis required involves examining the specific nature of thosepolicy operations. Developmen t policy operations come in many flavors, from macro scale to specific sectoral reforms. Moreover, they may mix reforms across different scales.Table 6.1 presents a list of typical reforms in World Bankdevelopment policy loans and potential forest linkages. How-ever, this can only serve as a guide, and initial country condi- tions, such as the nature of its environmental problems, its resource endowment, and the policy and institutional set-ting, are critical in determining the direction and magnitudeof effects of individual reforms on the environment.There are certain sectoral macro policy reforms that immediately raise red flags. These include agricultural reforms, such as reforms in land markets and improved rural finance; reforms of government institutions, such as marketing boards, which can potentially strengthen resourcemanagement; energy price reforms; natural resource pricereforms; changes in exchange rate regimes; and trade policyreforms. In contrast, closer assessment can be required for reforms with less apparent impacts on the forest sector, suchas macroeconomic, public, and fiscal reforms that includetax policy reforms, reforms to promote foreign direct invest-ment, and the like. The sectors in which many World Bank policy operations are concentrated (such as Central Government Administra-tion and the General Public Administration sector) do notimmediately suggest a direct or indirect link with forest outcomes. However, a closer examination of the thematic NOTE 6.3: IDENTIFYING THE NEED FOR ANALYSIS ON FORESTS IN DEVELOPMENT POLICY REFORMS 231Table 6.1 Typical Reforms in Policy- Based Operations, and Potential Forest Linkages Potential implications Sector Reforms for forests Energy Typically encompass pricing, subsidies, ownership, and regulatory Fuel substitution could potentially push issues. people to use biomass.

There are different schools of thought on this subject; note 5.4, Strengthening Fiscal Systems in the Forest Sector, suggest s a different outcome.orientation of the DPL operations can reveal areas of inter- vention in these categories that could potentially benefit oradversely affect forests. For example, 100 percent of a World Bank DPL operation proposed for Guatemala (in fiscal 2005) is allocated under the Central Government Adminis-tration sector. Thematically, this operation will focus on macroeconomic management and tax policy and adminis-tration\u2014themes that could impact forest outcomes (see box 6.15 for other relevant themes). Reviewing the most relevant effects of the reform and preliminarily assessing the environmental and socialimpacts are important to identifying where to focus a moredetailed analysis. It is usually important to identify and con- sult key interest groups, public representatives, government officials, and other stakeholders at this stage. Analyticaltools such as environmental balance sheets, checklists ofpossible effects of a particular type of policy, and a qualita-tive matrix can be helpful (see annex 6.3A to this note). The review should produce a conceptual map that the team can follow during the assessment process. The exercisecan also help distinguish between those effects that are mostlikely to occur and those that are severe and irreversible. Thereview only produces a strong indication of the eventualeffects of the policy reform, but not evidence regarding theactual connection. The latter strong indications are impor- tant for informing the policy revision process. Selecting the appropriate approach for handling cross-sectoral impacts. A clear understanding of the relationship between policy reform and the forest sector is needed to analyze and develop mechanisms for handling the cross-sectoral impacts. Numerous analytical tools canhelp in this understanding. The appropriate analyticalapproach should be tailored to answer the questions as pre-cisely as possible, show a good cost-benefit ratio, and be conducted with the available resources and accessible data.The analysis should be able to provide necessary informa-tion on links between the proposed reform and its impacton the forest sector. It should also provide options regard-ing measures to enhance positive impacts and mitigate neg- ative ones. The formulation of mechanisms for handling cross-sectoral impacts should blend quantitative and qual-itative information and bring in the outcomes of consulta-tive processes. T o assess the key issues, the assessment team will have to collect relevant data on economic, social, and political con-ditions, as well as information about the environment, thenatural resource base, and relevant institutions. This datawill serve in the reevaluation of the outcome of the initialreview. A central challenge will be to accurately understandand identify the economic, social, political, and environmen-tal factors because the downstream effects are often indirect. Approaches such as the CEA or SEAs can be useful for thispurpose (see note 6.4, Assessing Cross-Sectoral Impacts). The fast-disbursing nature of DPL operations may not allow for a detailed CEA or SEA analysis in tandem with thelending cycle. However, to ensure that required due dili-gence on determination of \"likely significant\" effects is car-ried out, a number of rapid assessment tools may have to beused. For example, simple analytical tools (and elasticityestimates) can be used to assess environmental implicationsof raising tariffs in the electricity and water sectors or foranalyzing the impact of relative price changes (often trig-gered by trade reforms) in agriculture and the implicationsthereof for forest depletion. Similarly, robust action-impactmatrices can be developed to capture economy-environ-ment linkages (such as fuel-switching implications ofenergy price reforms). 4 If a rapid or preliminary assessment indicates that spe- cific policy reforms supported by DPL operations are going to adversely impact forests or water resources, follow-up actions would need to be developed to help the borrower strengthen its institutional capacity and policy frameworkfor environmental and natural resource management inthese areas and monitoring of applicable indicators. A CEAor SEA would then be necessary. 232 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGEnvironmental policies and institutions, regu- lation and competition policy, rural policiesand institutions Macroeconomic management Environmental policies and institutions Rural policies and institutions Tax policy and administration Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring,decentralization Public expenditure, financial management andprocurement, infrastructure services for privatesector development Regulation and competition policy Regulation and competition policy, small andmedium enterprise support, trade facilitationand market access Rural services and infrastructure Source: World Bank 2005.Box 6.15 Themes Associated with World Bank Policy Lending Operations in FY05 andFY06 Relevant to the Forest SectorSelecting the appropriate analytical tools. Appro- priate analytical tools should be selected based on the objec- tive, data availability, cost, and time constraints. Different analytical tools have different expertise requirements, and costs will depend on many factors and vary considerably.Table 6.2 provides some guidance on the requirements, sig-nificance, and costs of select analytical tools. As a generalrule, the costs of national resource accounts, econometric modeling, and indicator frameworks will be relatively high,whereas impact and case studies or expert panels will be inthe medium or lower range. In comparing the differentstrengths and weaknesses of alternative designs, the teamshould try to combine some of their relative advantages and informative value. Research could start with case studies and lead to quantitative impact analysis or to econometricmodeling at a later stage. Qualitative studies can providerecommendations for quantitative monitoring over longerperiods of critical effects that result from particularly rele-vant policy linkages. Some standard tools include analysis of price changes, heuristic tools, such as checklists and action-effect matrices, and red flags (presented in annexes 6.3A and 6.3B to this note) that can be applied to better understand the nature and direction of environmental impacts. Most of these toolscan be applied to analysis of potential risks, including a setof red flags that indicate potential problems. However, in anumber of cases, policy reforms may also represent oppor- tunities for better management of the forest resources. Data requirements. Relevant data is generally unavailable. Conventional economic statistics and social data collected by governments and other interest groups frequently eitherunderestimate, or completely ignore, natural resourceissues. Adequate resource allocation to data collection willbe important. This will require gathering baseline data on thecurrent state of natural resources, identifying trends inresource use and degradation, and obtaining data on the pro-posed reforms and on the actual effects from similar reforms.

In collecting and working with data, the team must check for reliability, avoid double counting, and, where possible, indicate confidence limits or probabilities. Quantitative andqualitative data both have high value in these analyses andcan complement each other. Identifying entry points for addressing cross- sectoral impacts. Identifying the links between the policy reform and potential cross-sector impacts is an importantpart of this overall approach. Equally important, however, isidentifying entry points for addressing the potential cross- sector impacts. There are no specific good practices associ- ated with this. However, policy loans are also the entry pointfor mitigating any negative cross-sectoral impacts as well asenhancing positive impacts. This is partly because some ofthe measures for mitigating or enhancing certain impactscan involve strengthening environmental laws, institutions,and enforcement mechanisms (see chapter 5, Forest SectorGovernance, and note 5.5, Strengthening Legal Frameworksin the Forest Sector). LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS T o date, there has been relatively little field analysis of actual forest or natural resource outcomes from specific structuraladjustment or other programmatic forms of lending. 5Liter- ature and analyses of the relationship between large-scaleeconomic changes and outcomes for natural resources or forests specifically do not allow consistent conclusions to be drawn across the range of country and field situations. Nev-ertheless, some key inferences can be drawn with regard tounderstanding the relationship between macro policyreforms and forest outcomes. Economic and social forces originating outside forests generally have more impact upon those forests than do developments within the forest sector itself. Two broad les-sons can be taken from this observation: It is evident that for forests to make their maximum potential contribution to economic growth and povertyalleviation, major policies and incentives from outside the sector that affect forests must be addressed\u2014and policy lending instruments are appropriate to that task(see note 6.2, Prospects for Using Policy Lending toProactively Enable Forest Sector Reforms). It is also evident that, where forests are determined to be significant for economic growth and poverty alleviationat the national level, policy loans and large cross-sectoral operations that have the potential to impact forests (either positively or negatively) must take that potentialinto account in their design and implementation. As more policy loans are prepared, an immediate chal- lenge facing donors, client governments, and other institu- tions engaged in operations at the macroeconomic andlarger cross-sectoral levels, will be to mainstream effectivemonitoring of forest outcomes into these operations, wherethese are identified as being potentially significant with respect to forests. Researchers with country or regional experience should be part of any team examining cross-sectoral impacts to make a meaningful selection of relevant cross-sectorallinkages, to carry out consistent document analysis, toorganize expert interviews, and to collect and interpret theresults. Research methods need to be improved. Equally important is the need to launch specific case studies atnational, subnational, and local levels to provide moreempirical information on cross-sectoral successes as wellas on drawbacks in a given social, economic, and political context. Quantitative research is needed as much as qual-itative analysis to provide more information on thenature, structure, and functioning of different policiesand cross-sector links. Research should also examine theactors and stakeholders involved, the instruments andprocedures that influence their behavior, and the causalrelationship between forest and other policy domains inboth directions. Ways to manage cross-sectoral impacts need to be fur- ther examined. This will require understanding how differ-ent agencies actually work together, what agencies havewhich resources, and the possibility of contradictory oroverlapping competencies at the policy-setting and imple-mentation levels. New approaches in coordination mechanisms, as well as the likely limitations of coordination, need to be exam-ined. More research is needed on how coordinating mech-anisms, such as network management and interadminis-trative coordination, can be improved to contribute toreaching national forest policy goals. The current role offorest administrations and their ability to operate withsuccess in a given policy and administrative setting needsto be reconsidered. 234 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGNOTES 1. In the World Bank assessment of cross-sectoral impacts of DPL is a due diligence requirement for DPLs as per Oper- ational Policy 8.60. 2. The latter will have some relationship to the contribu- tion of forests to the economy, in that it will provide a mea- sure of whether the contribution, as currently constituted, issustainable. Eventually, a more rigorous approach to esti- mating the sustainability of ongoing forest operationswould be a useful ingredient in this overall measure, but it isnot possible to implement this approach at present. 3. T o assess the significance of forests relative to other sec- tors in a country, the variables used must compare the con-tribution of forests to poverty alleviation, economic devel-opment, and ecosystem services relative to other sectors(rather than compare these relative to other countries). 4. The Environment Department of the Social Development Network in the W orld Bank is developing a rapid assessmentDPL toolkit that will assist task managers in identifyingwhen a DPL operation could have likely significant impactson the environment, forests, and natural resources. A finalversion of this toolkit will be available in FY08. 5. The lessons learned and recommendations also draw findings from Schmith\u00fcsen, Bisang, and Zimmermann(2001).

(1999). Checklists A checklist can assist in determining the effects that arelikely to apply (table 6.3). This tool can be particularly use-ful if the list is focused on the most common and significant effects. The assessment team should review the checklist and provide a description and analysis of the relevant items. Matrices A matrix can assist in providing a clear summary of a quali- tative review or an assessment, and can be easily used forcomparing the various reforms and reform scenarios (table 6.4). The matrix can include such factors as direction of change, the severity or magnitude of the impact, reversibility,probability, duration, and potential mitigation measures. Amatrix can be qualitative and descriptive or include quantita- tive information. Quantitative matrices rely on scoring tech-niques or other standardized measures that assess various fac-tors such as the strength of environmental institutions. Networks Networks are diagrams that illustrate both the direct and indirect relationships between policies and the environ-ment. Networks can show the sequences of causes and effects moving through the economic, social, and political spheres, and thus provide a useful tool for selecting pointsof entry. Quantitative networks can be translated into math-ematical models for simulation purposes. Mathematicalapproaches can be useful when the assessment requires sim- ple calculations with large data sets, when there are complexlinks among the elements, when processes are time depend-ent, or when the relationship can only be defined in termsof statistical probabilities. 236 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGANNEX 6.3A SELECT TOOLS TO ASSIST SCOPING OF CROSS-SECTORAL IMPACTS Table 6.3 Sample Checklist for Devaluation Effect Probable Investigated Agricultural land (opening or abandonment) x x Land degradation (increase or decrease) Logging and extraction of natural resources (increase or decrease) xIndustrial pollution (increase or decrease) x x Water use (increase or decrease) Energy use (increase or decrease) x x Encroachment on protected area (increase or decrease) x x Wildlands and forests (increase or decrease) Source : Iannariello et al 1999.

Analysis of price changes For reforms that will have a foreseeable effect on prices, it may be possible to carry out a partial equilibrium analysis ofthe effects of price changes, assuming that sufficient data and time for analysis are available. The prices of interest will typically be natural resource and energy prices becausethese will have the most direct effect on the environmentand natural resources. Three forms of analysis are possible: Supply response. Will the price change affect the supply of a good (timber, for example)? Can supply elasticities, including cross-elasticities, be estimated? How rapid is the supply response likely to be? Demand response. Will the price change affect the demand for an environmentally sensitive good? Can demand elasticities, including cross-elasticities, be esti- mated (for example, will raising natural gas prices make coal relatively more attractive to consumers)? von Thunen analysis. Will the price change affect the rel- ative price of goods in such a manner as to change the location of economic activity? For example, will it make conversion of forested land to agriculture more prof- itable? Heuristic tools Checklists. When time and data limitations preclude the quantitative analysis of links between a policy-based opera- tion and forests, one fallback is to pose a set of questions about the individual operation or the broader country pro-gram. This could be on the availability of adequate analyti- cal underpinnings, policy and regulatory frameworks cover-ing the forest sector, institutional issues, and issues relatingto transparency and accountability (see Hamilton and Mani2005). Depending on the answers to these questions, actions might be taken in the design of the operation, or within thecountry program, to enhance positive and mitigate negativeeffects of the operation. Action-effect matrices. A more structured nonquantita- tive approach to analyzing effects can be achieved through the use of action-effect matrices. Using an action-effectmatrix, a given policy reform may be analyzed according tothe likelihood of effects on the poor mediated by the envi-ronment, forest, and natural resources, and the likelihood ofother effects on the environment (see Hamilton and Mani2005). Based on this more structured analysis of the indi-vidual components of a policy-based operation, it may bepossible to suggest design changes, mitigating actions, orindicators that should be monitored over time. Red flags Another nonquantitative approach to reviewing and analyz- ing policy-based operations is to look for \"red flags\"\u2014issuesthat raise the likelihood of significant effects on the environ- ment and natural resources. At the operational level these include energy price reforms, natural resource price reforms,and changes in exchange rate regimes. At the country pro-gram level, they could include economic, political, andresource risks; policy and institutional failures (particularly in the resource sectors); weak regulation and implementa-tion capacity; and lack of monitoring and enforcement. NOTE 6.3: IDENTIFYING THE NEED FOR ANALYSIS ON FORESTS IN DEVELOPMENT POLICY REFORMS 237ANNEX 6.3B TOOLS FOR RAPID ASSESSMENT OF CROSS-SECTORAL IMPACTSWithin the World Bank's Analytic and Advisory Activities, CEA and SEA were identified askey tools for informing country dialogue and more systematically addressing environmental concerns early in sectoral decision-making and planning processes,respectively. In August 2004, the World Bank approved and updated its policy on DPL. Operational Policy 8.60 (OP/BP 8.60) emphasizes upstream analytical work\u2014such as SEA, CEA,and other analyses done by the World Bank, the client coun-try, or third parties\u2014as a source of information for analyz-ing the likely significant effects of an operation on the bor-rowing country's environment and natural resources, and for assessing the country's institutional capacity for han- dling these effects. Specifically, under OP/BP 8.60, the World Bank is required to determine for each development policy loanwhether the specific country policies supported by the oper-ation are likely to have significant effects on the country'senvironment, forests, and natural resources. For policieswith significant effects, an assessment is required by Bankstaff of the country's systems for reducing adverse effectsand enhancing positive effects, drawing on relevant country-level or sectoral environmental analysis, a type of SEA. This note describes CEA, SEA, and rapid assessment tools; the context of their use; the process of applying these tools for assessing cross-sectoral impacts or for due dili-gence in policy operations 1; and finally, some examples of application in the forest sector. OPERATIONAL ASPECTS Country Environmental Analysis CEA is a diagnostic analytical tool that can help to system- atically evaluate the environmental priorities of client coun-tries, the environmental implications of key government policies, and the country's capacity to address environmen-tal priorities. The aim of CEA is to provide the analytical underpinning for sustainable development assistance. It hasthe potential to bring together the results of environmental,economic, and sectoral work and facilitate dialogue, bothwithin a country and among development partners. Specifically, CEAs have three main objectives: T o facilitate mainstreaming by providing information and analysis of key environment, development, andpoverty links in the country policy dialogue T o guide environmental assistance and capacity buildingsupported by the World Bank or other developmentpartners through an assessment of capacity issues, espe- cially in relation to specific environmental priorities T o facilitate a strategic approach to safeguard issues by providing analysis and information about environment-development links at the earliest stages of decision mak- ing, thus shaping key lending and programmatic deci- sions at the country and sectoral levels and helpingmanage risks at the project level Building blocks of a CEA. CEAs consist of three main building blocks (see figure 6.2): Assessment of the state of the environment and forest devel- opment priorities, involving systematic evaluation of key environment-development priorities (highlighting trends, the links to poverty, and environmental indica- tors relevant for development policy and for the achieve-ment of the Millennium Development Goals) Policy analysis, to identify key development policies that have potential implications for the environment, in par- ticular, those linked to forests and environment-devel- opment priorities Institutional capacity assessment, to evaluate the coun- try's institutional capacity to address key environmental priorities and respond to policy changes that have poten-Assessing Cross-Sectoral Impacts: Use of CEAs and SEAsNOTE 6.4 238tial environmental implications, particularly those related to forests Link with World Bank planning and lending. The programming of CEA preparation should be closely linked with the World Bank's annual business planning and budg-eting process, and be based to the extent possible on thescheduling of PRSPs, CASs, integrative country diagnostic analyses (such as development policy reviews or countryeconomic memoranda), or planned large DPL operationsthat may pose environmental issues. CEAs are most effectivewhen carried out in advance of the preparation of theseprocesses to allow environmental considerations to be introduced at the earliest stages of decision making. Examples of CEAs that have provided input to CASs and PRSPs include the ones for Bangladesh. Nigeria, and Serbia and Montenegro. CEAs carried out in the context of a DPLportfolio include those conducted for El Salvador, Ghana,and South Asia (Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan). CEAs canbe a basis for designing development policy loans, as was theColombia CEA. T o date, the only CEA that includes forests as a specific focus area is the Ghana CEA (see box 6.16). Forest issues doappear in some CEAs, broadly linked with other develop-ment concerns. For example, the Orissa CEA is a state-level environmental analysis in India that focuses on the govern-ment's program to generate growth from the mining sector. However, most of Orissa's mineral deposits are in forests that are inhabited by tribal populations and harbornumerous endangered and charismatic species. Mineralextraction, therefore, has disproportionately affected theforest-dwelling population, the environment, and forest ecosystems. The impact of mines upon natural ecosystems,biodiversity, and tribal livelihoods has been one of theprincipal concerns in Orissa and is often a source of con-flict. Hence, a particular component within the OrissaCEA is a study to assess the consequence of mining on affected forest-dependent populations through a house- hold survey. In the near term, several CEAs with a focus on natural resource management issues are planned in the Sub-Saharan Africa region; these are expected to focus in moredepth on forest issues. Full CEAs typically cost approxi-mately US$200,000, but this number varies with scope andmethodology. Experience with rapid CEAs, which provide asnapshot view in a stepwise approach to a CEA dialoguerather than a more detailed analysis, is limited, but thesetend to cost about US$60,000-$70, 000.

Strategic environmental assessment extends the application of environmental assessment from projects to plans, policies, and programs (PPPs). Policies influencesocial behavior and changes in behavior may result in signif-icant indirect environmental effects. Programs leading to theimplementation of several projects in a particular region or forest may have cumulative environmental impacts that arenot accounted for in the individual EIA of each project.Unlike projects, PPPs, particularly policies, may be heavilyinfluenced by political considerations. For these reasons,SEA has been developed as a specific approach different from, although related to, EIA (box 6.17).SEA uses diverse tools and approaches. SEA can include a wide range of approaches and make use of a variety of different tools. Some SEAs can be stand-alone processes running parallel to core planning processes, while others can be integrated into the planning and policy- and 240 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGThe Ghana CEA specifically recognized the challenges facing the forest and wildlife sector. Building on an ear-lier study that focused on costs of degradation from the forest sector, the CEA undertook an analysis of the pol- icy, legal, and regulatory framework; institutions(mandate, capacity, incentives); and a public expendi-ture review. The analysis found that Ghana's natural resources are overexploited and continue to decline in both quantity and quality. Cocoa farming, gold mining, andthe wood industry are threatening high altitude forests.Ongoing soil erosion undermines food and agricul-tural production, human activities are degrading wet-lands, and silt accumulation and alien species threaten goods and services provided by Lake Volta. Indeed, it is estimated that the degradation of agricultural soils,forests, coastal fisheries, wildlife resources, and LakeVolta's environment accounts for losses of at leastUS$520 million annually (around 4.9 percent ofGhana's annual GDP). The analysis also found the general policy and leg- islative framework to be adequate, and that significantprogress had been made in recent years, but thatsevere challenges remained relating to the implemen-tation and enforcement of policies and laws on forests,wildlife, protected areas, and habitat management.The CEA therefore stressed the need for (i) urgentattention to resolving the causes of forest degradation and habitat loss, and (ii) addressing underlying gover-nance and institutional problems and insecure finan- cial arrangements. The CEA 's principal recommendations were that (i) high priority should be given to an agreed on finan- cial arrangement that provides secure and sustainablefinancing for the operations of all divisions of the Forestry Commission, including provisions for thecosts of strengthened wildlife protected area manage-ment; (ii) government should demonstrate its supportand commitment to improved log and wood trackingsystems; (iii) contracts and benefit-sharing arrange-ments for all recently established plantations\u2014how- ever established\u2014should be concluded and perfected; (iv) government should continue its policy commit-ments to competitive bidding and a better investmentclimate for private sector investment (whether in plan-tations, timber processing, or ecotourism), but itshould be matched by improved transparency of allo-cation, a level playing field for all, conversion of timberleases into Timber Utilization Contracts, and a credibleenforcement regime for payments of fees, includingTimber Rights Fees, stumpage, and performance bonds;and (v) an extended policy dialogue on scenarios forindustry reform should be reinvigorated and includethe Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning.

Source: OECD 2006.Box 6.17 SEA Definitiondecision-making processes. SEA may focus on environmen- tal impacts or its scope can be the integrated considerationof all three dimensions of sustainability: environmental, social, and economic. SEA may be applied to predetermined PPPs or be integrated into PPP formulation, and mayengage a broad range of stakeholders or be limited to expertanalysts. SEA can be conducted in a short time frame orover a long period. Some SEA may consist of a quick analy- sis while others require detailed analysis. Environmentalassessment can be the starting point of an SEA but SEA canalso be fed into an existing process, such as policy analysis.Furthermore, SEA could be a finite, output-based effort, ora more continuous process that is integrated within institu- tional processes. SEA provide a flexible approach. From an operational standpoint, SEA can provide a flexible approach that varies according to the complexity of the decision-makingprocess. At one extreme, it focuses on impact assessmentand, at the other extreme, it centers on institutions andgovernance (see chapter 5, Improving Forest Governance).Along the continuum that lies between these two, the deci-sion-making process is more significantly influenced bypolitical bargaining and the interaction of different interestgroups and constituencies. Consequently, only a balanced institutional framework can capture and effectively takeinto account the rights and concerns of small communities,minorities, and stakeholders affected by environmentaldegradation. Therefore, as PPPs move up in the decision-making hierarchy for contributing to sustainability indevelopment processes, SEAs focus more on building insti-tutional capacity and strengthening governance than onassessing impacts. Impact centered SEA and institution centered SEA. When political economy factors and political bargaining arenot important in defining a PPP , the SEA is rooted in EIAexperiences and methodologies involving technicalprocesses. Some observers have called this the \"impact-cen-tered approach to SEA \" 2because it focuses primarily on pre- dicting, preventing, and mitigating adverse environmental and social impacts, similar to EIA of projects and activities. Conversely, in PPPs significantly influenced by political economy and political factors, the SEA is rooted in policy,institutional, and governance analysis, involving multistage,nonlinear, iterative processes. Because of this focus, it can becalled an \"institutions-centered approach to SEA.\" Although both types of SEA can be used in forestry PPPs, impact-centered SEAs are largely adequate in programs andplans for reforestation, extraction, and processing of wood and nonforest products, and watershed protection. Typi-cally, an impact-centered SEA consists of the following fourstages 3: First is establishing the context for the SEA, in which potential impacts are screened, the SEA 's objective is set,and stakeholders are identified. Next is implementation of the SEA. It begins with estab-lishing the scope of the SEA and the participatoryapproaches to bring in relevant stakeholders. Like EIA, in this stage baseline data is collected, alternatives are iden- tified, and measures to mitigate adverse impacts andenhance opportunities are proposed. This stage includesan assessment of the institutional conditions needed toeffectively implement the SEA recommendations. These results are circulated publicly during a consultationprocess and a final report is prepared. The third stage is informing and influencing decision making. It overlaps to some extent with the second phasebecause presentation of the draft and final reports are key points to influence decision makers. In this stage, decision makers become aware of the options open tothem, the likely effects of particular choices, and the con-sequences if they fail to reach a decision. The last stage is monitoring and evaluation of the SEA. Institutions-centered SEA is mostly appropriate for forestry policies, in general, and forestry reform, in particu- lar. Forestry reform induces changes in property rights,institutional reform, and adjustment in the incentivesregime to manage and use forests, and thus is likely toengender significant environmental and social effects and opportunities (see note 5.2, Reforming Forest Institutions).In this situation, SEA can only be successful if it influencesthe reform and policy process, which requires SEA to befully integrated into the decision-making process. The SEAteam should work along with the forestry policy team responsible for the reform. It should provide inputs on the potential environmental and social effects of the proposedpolicies and be responsive to the requirements of policymakers and planners when policies are being formulatedand implemented. In box 6.18 a program SEA for the imple-mentation of forestry policy in Cameroon presents keycomponents of an institutions-centered SEA in the contextof an impact-centered SEA. In box 6.19, an institutions-cen-tered SEA on the Kenya Forest Act is described to illustratehow the SEA was integrated with the decision-makingprocess and World Bank activities. NOTE 6.4: ASSESSING CROSS-SECTORAL IMPACTS: USE OF CEA SAND SEA S 241Considering the above issues, an institutions-centered SEA comprises the following three stages4: Identification of the potential significant environmental and social effects and opportunities that may result froman operation Assessment of institutional capacity to manage the envi-ronmental and social effects and opportunities, and totake into account interests of affected stakeholdersCapacity building and governance strengthening forenvironmental sustainability LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS Country Environmental Analyses There is considerable flexibility in CEA scope and design. CEAs can focus on all key environmental issues linked with 242 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGBetween 1992 and 1996, Cameroon established a New Forestry Policy, only partially implemented because oflimited capacity of national institutions. The Forest & Environment Sector Program (FESP) was developed to address this gap and, therefore, focuses on strengthen-ing national institutions responsible for sustainablemanagement of forests. The Cameroon Ministry ofEnvironment and Forests carried out a SEA of the FESP with the double objective of optimizing the environ-mental and social impacts of the program and verifyingits conformity to the environmental and social policiesof the World Bank. The SEA was undertaken by a mul-tidisciplinary team of national and international con-sultants, and included an integrated impact assessment, general sector analysis work, and public consultation. About 10 consultations were held with the local populations in six provinces. Two national workshops and four joint multidonor missions with the participa-tion of NGOs were organized. Also, during the imple-mentation of the FESP , a regular program of local con-sultation on the social and environmental impacts ofthe program were to be implemented. The SEA shows that most of the negative impacts identified in the sector are not derived from forestry pol-icy itself, but from the limited institutional capacity forimplementation. If the program attains its objective, itwill have large positive environmental and social impacts. However, the SEA brought out some environ-mental and social risks that will be associated with theimplementation of the forestry policy. The main onesfollow: Environmental level. (i) the risk of increased poach- ing activities following access to vast and previously inaccessible areas; (ii) the risk of overexploitation of agricultural and pastoral territories and other resources (firewood, water, and so forth)Social level. (i) the risk of reducing access to some areas and resources as a result of the landscape approach used and the classification of forests and protected areas; (ii) the risk of conflicts between investors and the administration on one hand, andsome social groups on the other hand, if the distri-bution of forest revenue does not materialize; (iii)marginalization of Indigenous Peoples (Pygmies) resulting from lack of adaptation of compensation measures to their cultural specificities The SEA also identified extra-sectoral social and environmental risks that may affect the FESP , such as strong population growth combined with extensiveagricultural production systems, or the malfunctioningof the judicial system. It recommended that the pro-gram develop links with policies and programs externalto the forestry sector, and act on the strategies of ruraldevelopment, promotion of the rule of law, povertyreduction, and promotion of the private sector. The SEA proposed the following plans to accom- pany program execution: A Master Plan of Access to Resources, to reduce the risk of loss of access to resources. It includes neces-sary procedures for public consultation and the maintenance of users' rights in all circumstances. A Development Plan for Pygmies, to ensure that the pygmies could fully draw on the opportunitiesoffered by community forests, share charges and employment opportunities, and be guaranteed that the quality of their mode of life would continue The Permanent Environment Secretariat, to execute a monitoring and management plan for social andenvironmental impacts. The development of the Secretariat's capacity to implement this plan was to be supported by the PSFE.Box 6.18 The Sector Study of Social and Environmental Impacts of Forest & Environment Sector Program in Cameroon Source: Derived from Ministry of the Environment and Forestry (2003).NOTE 6.4: ASSESSING CROSS-SECTORAL IMPACTS: USE OF CEA SAND SEA S 243The government of Kenya ratified a new forest bill in September 2005, an outcome of the Kenya ForestryMaster Plan finalized in 1991. It intends to unlock opportunities for forest resources to contribute to eco- nomic development and poverty alleviation, and toenable socially and environmentally sustainable forestmanagement and conservation. The bill embraces theconcept of participatory forest management, a radical departure from the government's previous practice ofassuming full management responsibilities. The billalso encourages the formation of forest communityassociations to be recognized as management partners.Commercial plantations will be open to lease arrange-ments by interested groups to supplement government efforts, with the aim of improving their productivity and increase availability of timber and other productsand services to the country and for export. In April 2006, the World Bank supported a SEA of the implementation of the Kenya Forests Act, focusedon integrating environmental, social, economic, andinstitutional considerations of the act and strengthen-ing the processes for its implementation. The act con-tains many innovative improvements, including astrong emphasis on partnerships, engagement of localcommunities, and promotion of private investment.The purpose of the SEA was to inform and influencethe process of implementing the new Forests Act and indirectly inform the policy dialogue regarding sustain-able use of natural resources for national development.The SEA examined current risks confronting bothwoodland and forest environments and the social well-being of communities relying on these resources. Evi-dence gathered through research and extensive consul-tation was used to identify the scope for improvinginstitutional structures and governance processes underthe planned forestry reforms; notably those relating tothe Kenya Forest Service and the participation of com-munities and the private sector in forest management.The SEA recommends ways of enhancing the opportu-nities for environmental and social gain, which alreadyform part of the overall goal of the Forests Act. A crucial element of the SEA has been its reliance on the active participation of a wide range of stakeholders,which has been essential in identifying key issues andpriorities for action. The SEA has also examined con-ditions within two forest areas to assess priority issues and consider the views of community forest associa-tions and other local stakeholders. Important characteristics of the SEA in Kenya include the following: Reliance on rapid assessment of the political econ-omy and analysis of existing publications to estab-lish the background to implementation of the act Strong emphasis on the role of stakeholder groupsto help identify priority areas of concern and keyintersectoral environmental and social linkages Use of a case study to help identify potential win-ners and losers arising from implementation andthe extent to which sustainable forest management benefits are likely to be shared throughout society Development of a policy-action matrix that incor- porates an accountability and transparency frame-work, to assist the government in charting out how to effectively implement the act The SEA analyzed social, environmental, and eco- nomic risks and assessed opportunities, and examined potential weaknesses in institutional structure and governance. Through consultation and analysis, theSEA identified three priority areas for action: strategicmanagement and planning of the Forest Service,enabling community participation and benefit sharing,and enabling investment in the forest sector. Strategic planning and management of the Kenya Forest Service embraces a number of subsidiary themes, the most important of which are: enabling proper governance (including trans- parency and accountability) of the Kenya ForestService; ensuring proper strategic planning of forestresources; maximizing the economic value of these resourcesfor the nation; and achieving effective financial management and regu-lation of the forest sector. Community participation and benefit sharing com- bines the following interlinked objectives:Box 6.19 Implementation of the Kenya Forests Act: An Institution-Centered SEA (Box continues on the following page. )growth and poverty reduction or on a few priority issues. CEAs can also analyze broad institutional issues linked withenvironmental management or focus on institutional analy- sis in key sectors of the economy. CEAs are most effective when carried out in advance of the preparation of PRSPs, CASs, or development policy loans to allow environmental considerations to be intro-duced at the earliest stages of decision making. Policy considerations at the country level will be key to the timing of the CEA. For instance, a change in government, or opportunities arising from governmentplanning processes, may signal the need for a CEA. Institu-tional changes in the country\u2014such as the restructuring ofgovernment agencies\u2014may also call for a CEA. Issues toconsider include the following: Is there a planning and policy process that the national or state government is considering that requires analytical sup-port on the environment? Is there a routine development planning process that could be influenced by the CEA? Is there a change in the government that could benefit from policy advice through CEA? Is the new governmentlikely to take note of specific environmental concerns or is there a need for overarching guidance? Are there champions of environmental sustainability in the newgovernment who could use the CEA for their efforts? Is there restructuring taking place in environmental or other ministries that would require institutional analyses?Is there an opportunity to review the organizational struc- ture that supports environmental management? Is there ademand for capacity building? Are there new laws and leg- islation that call for strategic attention to the environment? Is there a demand from the environment or other min- istries for strategic environmental analysis? Do largereform programs take place that may have environmen- tal implications? Are there transboundary issues that require cross-country coordinated environmental analy-ses? Is analytical support required to help the countrymeet the conditions of international agreements? CEAs can strengthen country level dialogue. CEAs can also be prepared in a country to strengthen country- level dialogue on environmental development issues, toupdate existing work, or to reestablish dialogue with a clientcountry in postconflict situations. Strategic Environmental Assessments SEAs can contribute to the analysis of development alternatives. The SEA will not identify alternatives for implementing PPPs, but it will provide key information and suggestions that contribute, among other factors, to the alternatives analysis and, therefore, to the decision-makingprocesses. Another SEA strength is that in a systematic andorderly way, it can bring into the alternatives analysis theperspective of potentially affected groups and civil society, reinforcing the long-term feasibility of PPPs. 244 CHAPTER 6: MAINSTREAMING FORESTS INTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PLANNINGensuring that all forest communities and those adja- cent to forest areas are involved in decision makingand implementation; equitably sharing associated costs and benefitsamong communities, the private sector, and govern-ment; protecting indigenous and customary access anduse of forest resources by communities; and enabling equitable and fair partnerships. Enhancing investment in the forest sector means ensuring the right mix of public and private to ensure sustainable forest management so that the sector con-tributes to the national goal of poverty reduction (seenote 2.1, Company-Community Partnerships). This involves: creating an enabling environment for forest sector private investment (both corporate and commu-nity); enabling and strengthening partnerships; and improving transparency and accountability ofinvestment activities. The SEA proposed main adjustments that were pre- sented in a policy-action matrix that the government and other stakeholders could use to guide implementa-tion of the act.Box 6.19 Implementation of the Kenya Forests Act: An Institution-Centered SEA (continued) Source: World Bank 2007. SEAs are useful for analyzing the cumulative and indirectly induced effects of PPPs. Cumulative effects are the combined effects of several projects or interventions within a project and development trends in a region or sec- tor. Indirectly induced effects (behavioral effects) areadverse or beneficial environmental effects caused bychanges in people's behavior resulting from economic andsocial processes induced or influenced by a specific PPP . For an SEA to influence policy making, it must focus on the \"target audience.\" In order to influence policy making, an SEA target audience can often include policymakers and policy constituencies or interest groups andother affected groups. Ministries of finance, for example,will be more receptive to analysis providing quantifiedestimates of the environmental effects (positive or nega-tive) of various policy options (for example, as a percentageof GDP). Ministries and agencies mandated to reducepoverty will be receptive to analysis focusing the impacts ofgiven policy choices on the most vulnerable groups, espe-cially if that analysis results from consultation with affectedgroups. Elected officials, who tend to have short-term hori-zons, will be more receptive to information on the short-term impacts of given policy choices. The positive short-term impacts of proposed amendments to policy proposals should also be highlighted and, if possible, quantified. Institution centered SEA should extend beyond identification environmental and social priorities.In an institutions-centered SEA, stakeholder participationgoes beyond identification of environmental and social pri-orities to inform the formulation and implementation ofPPPs. It also contributes to leveling the political playing fieldfor stakeholders affected by or vulnerable to environmentaldegradation, and for their interests to be taken into accountin the policy process. Sometimes this requires involvingstakeholders and considering other sectors, because forestryreform may have environmental implications in other sec-tors, such as tourism, agriculture, hydropower, transport,mining, and so forth. Consequently, the apex of an SEA maybe an intersectoral committee. Likewise, in institutions-centered SEAs, the analysis of the institutional forestry framework cannot be constrainedto the environmental institutions related to the sector.Other sector institutions, such as forestry concessions, taxes,community forestry rights (see note 1.3, Indigenous Peoplesand Forests, and note 1.2, Community-Based Forest Man-agement, and note 5.4, Strengthening Fiscal Systems in theForestry Sector), and private contracts and arrangements, may have major implications in natural resource use, defor-estation, and environmental degradation. Therefore, the scope of the SEA 's institutional analysis must also comprise these institutions and their influence on environmental andsocial aspects of forest management. It is in this context thatgovernance issues like community organization, access tothe judiciary, transparency, access to resources, and accountability of decision makers for lost environmentalservices and environmental degradation also need to beconsidered in the SEA. Capabilities for carrying out SEA can be strengthened and developed at the following levels: Enhancing the skills of SEA practitioners Improving the quality of SEA review Improving environmental management systems Promoting informed participation and dialogue within planning and policy processes to create opportunities forincorporating environmental considerations in the for- mulation and implementation of plans and policies NOTES 1. CEAs and SEAs are not limited in their application to cross-sectoral impacts or due diligence in policy operations. 2. See, for example UNDP et al. (2005: 51). 3.

Rele- vant forest information that is systematically and periodi-cally collected can enable effective implementation of poli-cies, inform decision making, and guide management (seebox 7.1). Current and accurate information on forests also can help raise the profile of the sector and increase awarenessof forest resources' potential. Abundant evidence points tohow inadequate information on forests and weak monitor-ing capacity have resulted in poor forest policies, planning,and management; hampered efforts to reduce illegal and unsustainable extraction of forest resources and improve transparency; and resulted in undervaluation of forestresources. Such conditions, in turn, contribute to continuousdecline in area, health, stock, and flows of forest resources. Emerging financing opportunities for sustainable forest management under the climate change agenda will requireeffective systems for monitoring forest cover and carbonemissions and additional information on the resource baseand drivers of change. More specifically, efforts to enhancethe contribution of forests to reducing carbon emissions(through reduced emissions from deforestation and degra-dation [REDD] initiatives) will require participating coun- tries to establish a credible reference scenario on REDDbased on methodological guidance from the UN Frame-work Commission on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Mostlikely this will require assessments of historical emissionquantities and trends and establishment of a forest resource database. The assessments of historical emissions and trendscan help identify a reference scenario. REDD pilot projects will be undertaken between 2008 and 2012 with the hope that REDD will be endorsed in the post-Kyoto climate pro-tocol. Any country selected for the pilot initiative will haveto design and implement a system that effectively monitorsand verifies its REDD. Payment for environmental services from forests requires that these services be properly valued, which, in turn, requires that the forest resource base and otherresources (water, soil, and the like) be appropriately moni-tored. Such forest information and monitoring can also improve knowledge about the relationship between forests and other environmental services and facilitate opportuni-ties to generate multiple benefits from forest resources. Forexample, ongoing discussions on the role of forests in cli-mate change and the Convention on Biological Diversity(CBD) have stimulated efforts to include biodiversity bene-fits as a consideration when identifying forest sites forREDD. Information on forest cover and other relevant envi-ronmental benefits would assist in identifying forest areaswith multiple benefits. Better and more timely inventories and broader infor- mation collection on forest resources enables planning and implementing sustainable productive use of resources,including determining allowable cut and plantation andnatural forest management. Information on forest use isneeded for monitoring changes in the resource base and 247Monitoring and Information Systems for Forest ManagementCHAPTER 7causes for change and identifying ways to integrate forest development efforts with overall sustainable developmentin the country. From a poverty standpoint, monitoring can provide more accurate information on how changes in resources and their uses are affecting the rural poor, andwhether the pattern of resource use by the rural poor is sus-tainable (see chapter 1, Forests for Poverty Reduction). Robust information on changes in quality and quantity of forest resources and periodic monitoring can assist in identifying factors driving forest change. Time series infor-mation generated through spatial maps of forest cover,roads, poverty levels, and property rights can help in theanalysis of cross-sectoral relationships. Such monitoringefforts can be used to understand the influence of external factors on forest resources, monitor illegal logging (see note5.5, Addressing Illegal Logging), or assess carbon assimi- lated by forests. Innovative application of spatial and other monitoring tools can facilitate such uses (see box 7.2). Periodic collection of, and public access to, relevant and robust forest information can enable better resource man-agement. Other contributions to a new environment for decision making have included advances in understandingcomplex interactions, both within ecosystems and amongecosystems, human activities, and human well-being;improvements in information technologies and greateraccess to information as a result of computers and data sys- 248 CHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENTIn 1998 in Armenia, the available forest inventory data dated back to the former Soviet Union inventory results.A strategic objective inventory of the Armenian forests, financed by SIDA (the Swedish International Develop- ment Agency), was carried out to obtain better decisionsupport for ongoing policy development in the country. The results got the attention of decision makers. Measured growth was twice the previous official fig- ures per hectare per year, and cuttings totaled six timesthe official annual maximum allowable cut per hectare.It became apparent that illegal cuttings were a bigproblem and that cutting was not generally carried outin a sustainable manner. These inventory results, shared with Armenia's policy makers at a seminar,became an incentive for change in national forest pol- icy. Further inventory was recommended to update the forest policy. In 2005 the government adopted a decree establish- ing the State Forest Monitoring System, which includesestablishing a monitoring center responsible for moni- toring illegal logging and timber removal and prevent-ing illegal activities in forests. Donor support for thework is being provided by the World Bank, the govern-ment of Japan, and others.Box 7.1 Monitoring Promotes Changes in Armenian Forest Policy Source: Thuresson 2002. Since fiscal 2002 several lending operations in Europe and Central Asia have focused on sector reforms toimprove the efficiency and effectiveness of energy ser- vice delivery in the region. A review of the World Bank's activities with regard to the fiscal, efficiency, social, andenvironmental dimensions of energy sector reforms inthe region considered human health benefits resultingfrom reduced pollution in the electricity sector (Lampi- etti 2004). However, the study also discussed the possi-bility that the reforms have damaged health becausehouseholds switched to dirty fuels (such as wood, coal,or kerosene). The study also highlighted the possibilitythat fuelwood use may cause deforestation, althoughthis could not be proven because of inadequate data.This study used spatial information to assess the environmental impact of energy reform. The method- ology made it possible to identify where households (because of poverty levels) might switch to dirty fuels. Overlaying this information with data on forest coverrevealed where the risk of increased residential wooduse is greatest. With this information it was possible toconsider promoting access to alternative energy sources and more efficient wood stoves in high-riskareas, as well as to prepare and implement spatiallyexplicit forest management plans and encourage par-ticipatory forest management to reduce this risk. Extensive in-country collaboration aided the data collection process for this study.Box 7.2 Using Spatial Monitoring to Assess Links Between Energy Reform and Forests Source: Lampietti 2004.tems; the changing paradigm of poverty; and ongoing pol- icy and institutional reform. Multiple users in governments,the private sector, and civil society need better scientific information, such as that provided through technical assess- ments. Furthermore, the general public can make use ofinformation found in assessments to hold decision makersaccountable (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2003). PAST ACTIVITIES The World Bank has monitoring components in various investment projects, some of which are discussed in thenotes associated with this chapter. It is estimated that approximately US$28 million has been invested in monitor- ing components of forest sector projects over 2002-05. Thisinvestment is nearly evenly distributed between creation offorest management information systems (FMIS), forestinventories, and development of capacity and tools for spa- tial monitoring. This component of forest activities isexpected to increase as investments in governance increase(with monitoring of illegal logging activities) and as clientcountry interest in avoided deforestation matures. KEY ISSUES Temporal aspects of monitoring. Forest monitoring is an assessment of the status of forests at different times, often including assessment of changes within established features (that is, changes within boundaries of protected areas, for- est concessions, private properties, and so on). Forest mon-itoring thus requires systematic periodic assessment. Monitoring should update forest management. An effective forest monitoring system is much more than a technical set of data and techniques. A political process andthe political will to integrate findings from forest informa-tion systems and to update management approaches andpolicies makes monitoring useful. An effective forest moni-toring system is one that is tied to appropriate politicalprocesses that enable corrective actions. National forest inventories. Continuous or repeated forest assessments (or forest inventories) are often neces- sary to enable resource use planning and management.National forest inventories (NFIs) are an example of suchassessments. NFIs provide information relevant fornational-level decision making, policy formulation, andmonitoring for forestry and related sectors, as well as forforestry planning in smaller geographical or political unitsat the subnational level (see note 7.1, National Forest Inven-tories). Because the results are an input to global forestassessments, there is also regional and global interest inhigh-quality national forest information. Several newmethodologies and technologies can improve inventory, planning, implementation, analysis, and reporting of forestinventories (see table 7.1). Selection of tools or approachesshould be informed by the characteristics of the activitybeing monitored and the availability of required capacity,hardware, and other supports. Building national capacity for gathering and using information. Capacity to collect forest sector data and con- duct forest inventories has declined since the 1960s. Currently, few national statistical organizations are strong enough to beof value in policy processes. The challenge at the local level ispartly driven by poor links between information demand andsupply (Holmgren and Persson 2002). In recent decades forest information seems to have been supply driven, partly becauseof the promotion of remote sensing rather than field work.The policy process, therefore, has been guided by what can be CHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENT 249Table 7.1 Areas Where New Methodologies and T echnologies are Expected to Benefit NFIs Main phases of a national forest inventory Data quality Analysis Methodology and data (including or technology Planning Implementation management modeling) Reporting Remote sensing X X X Satellite navigationsystems X XMeasurement devices XMobile information andcommunication X XSoftware and algorithms X X X Sampling options X X Source : Kleinn 2002.collected via remote sensing rather than by a need for specific information. Changing this trend will require a close exami-nation of how information is used in national and interna- tional policy processes and will require building the capacity to gather and use this relevant information. In many countries, national statistical services are under- resourced and are unable to deliver reliable data in a timelyfashion. Often, national statistical databases are filled with gaps or use imputed values that are prone to gross errors.This creates a vicious circle, with users dismissing the ser-vices of the statistical organizations, reducing the fundingfor these organizations, and causing them to continuallyperform poorly. Despite this reality, several national govern- ments report on forest data, and some carry out periodic monitoring of forest resources. More recently, donor programs have also concentrated on collecting information rather than building capacity,although this is slowly changing and investment in capacityis occurring. Recent donor initiatives include the MarrakechAction Plan for Statistics, which coordinates donor supportfor statistical capacity building and encourages countries tomerge their own priorities for statistical developmentthrough the preparation and implementation of nationalstrategies for development of statistics. There is still, how-ever, room for further investment in capacity and infra- structure for monitoring and reporting. Scope and status of national forest monitoring efforts. More detailed information on what differentcountries are doing in forest monitoring would be helpful for designing interventions in monitoring, as well as deter-mining how a global monitoring system, compatible across countries, may be created. For example, the Forest Survey of India (FSI), an organization under the Ministry of Environ-ment & Forests, was mandated in 1986 to monitor and mapthe country's forest cover on a biennial basis. Consequently,FSI has been carrying out assessments of the country's for- est cover using satellite-based remote sensing data and hasbeen publishing its findings in the State of Forest Report(SFR) every two years (see box 7.3). Similar institutional arrangements for spatial monitor- ing exist in several other countries (for an example in Brazil, see box 7.4). There is a need to understand how these mon- itoring arrangements are set up; what technologies andmethodologies are used; the periodicity with which infor-mation is collected; how the information is processed, ana-lyzed, and reported; and who the end users are. REDD: Determining baselines (reference scenarios). Discussions on the role of forests in climate change mustdistinguish between deforestation and degradation. Thisdistinction is important because the appropriate tools fordetecting deforestation (for example, remote sensing to cap-ture clear-cuts) may not be as effective in detecting degra- dation. Furthermore, monitoring specific to REDD willneed to satisfy UNFCCC and Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change (IPCC) criteria, which are slightly differentfrom conventional forest needs. 250 CHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENTThe Forest Survey of India assesses the forest cover of the country on a two-year cycle using satellite data. Themain objective is to present information on the coun- try's forest resources at the state and district levels, and to prepare forest cover maps on a 1:50,000 scale. Thefirst forest cover assessment of the country was madein 1987; eight more assessments have been made, withforest cover information at the district level being available beginning with the third assessment, in 1991.Before the fourth assessment, forest cover assessmentfor the entire country was generated through visualinterpretation. After the eighth assessment in 2001, theentire country was assessed digitally. The 2003 assessment, like the 2001, includes infor- mation on lands that are at least 1 hectare that havetree canopy density of at least 10 percent. The infor- mation does not differentiate land use or ownership,and all perennial woody vegetation\u2014including bam- boos, palms, coconut, and apple trees\u2014were treated as trees; agroforestry plantations were also consideredforests. The findings of the assessments are published in the biennial State of Forest Report, which includes forest cover maps for the country, the states, and Union T erri-tories. These maps, prepared with the use of remote sens-ing technology, are also used for carrying out other spa-tial studies, such as monitoring shifting cultivation,assessment of forest density, mining leases, wildlife habi-tats, forest fragmentation, forest fire affected areas, assessment of mangroves, and delineation of forest types.Box 7.3 Forest Assessments in India Source: Authors' compilation.CHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENT 251Three significant monitoring efforts are occurring in Brazil: the Brazilian Space Agency project PRODES,the Amazon Surveillance System (SIV AM-SIPAM), and the government of the state of Mato Grosso's Environ- mental Control System on Rural Properties. PRODES Since the 1980s, the PRODES project has been moni- toring the extent of gross and annual deforestation inthe Brazilian Amazon based on interpretation of high- resolution satellite imagery (Landsat). Although highly automated, the deforestation mapping remains alabor-intensive process in which, each year, more than220 satellite scenes are scanned, selected for minimumcloud coverage, geo-referenced, and prepared to run a predefined algorithm for analysis (for example, trans-forming vegetation, shade, and light features). Featuresare then classified and edited to derive deforestationand other maps by state (from a 1997 baseline). Thethematic maps and Landsat imagery are made availableto the Brazilian community. The deforestation mapping has some limitations. Besides being labor intensive, the analysis is alsodependent on the availability of cloud-free imagery.PRODES mapping also misses small plots of deforesta-tion (3.0 to 6.5 hectares) caused by small disturbancesto the forest canopy, such as those caused by selectivelogging, which is practiced extensively throughout theBrazilian Amazon. Enforcement of policy and regula-tion at the federal level remains fragile, yet such defor-estation data can provoke significant public pressure,which often results in policy changes. SIVAM-SIPAM The Amazon Surveillance System project ( Sistema de Vigil\u00e2ncia da Amaz\u00f4nia in Portuguese) is a multi-billion dollar monitoring system that uses a sophisticated mix of fixed and mobile ground radar and airborne sur- veillance. SIV AM was conceived in the 1990s by theOffice of the President, the Ministry of Justice, and theBrazilian Air Force, to defend the Legal Amazon andmonitor illegal activity (d rug trafficking, illegal log- ging, or burning). The system, later renamed the Ama- zonian Protection System (SIPAM) came into force in1999. SIV AM's infrastructure is able to acquire, process, and disseminate a variety of spatial information fromvarious sources (radar, Landsat, SPOT [Satellite Pourl'Observation de la This costly, solid infrastructure and capacity for compre-hensive monitoring; the data that can be acquired andprocessed could be applied to environmental monitor-ing, including vegetation cover, hydrology, human occupation, and fire monitoring. With all its potential,nevertheless, it appears that social buy-in for SIV AMhas not consolidated completely. Environmental Control System on Rural Properties The State Environment Foundation of Mato Grosso (FEMA/MT)\u2014the entity responsible for managementof the state's environmental policy\u2014developed the Environmental Control System on Rural Properties. This system uses monitoring as one element to enforceexisting legislation, mitigate environmental liabilities,and protect environmental assets. The system focuseson large land holdings (1,000 hectares or more) in areas most affected by deforestation. FEMA usesRemote Sensing (RS)/Geographic Information System(GIS) technology to collect and manage land-useinformation\u2014particularly agriculture and livestock\u2014in the state, using visual interpretation of land coverand deforestation from detailed satellite images to pri- oritize field visits; identification of heat sources from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA)satellite data to identify areas of incidence of fire andfire risk; GIS technology to generate maps, graphics,and tables to help field inspectors and planners tolocate, quantify, and categorize environmental damage;its comprehensive GIS reference library of propertiesto pinpoint the precise location of licensed activities onproperties; and a Global Positioning System (GPS) toguide FEMA field inspectors to locations where non-compliance is suspected. GPS is also useful to updateand complement RS/GIS data with information fromthe ground. The system has proven to be efficient and the role of RS/GIS has helped target and prioritize areas for field inspection. Over two months in 2000, for instance, 10field teams carried out inspection and enforcementcampaigns on almost 3,000 rural properties. For thesame year, 50 noncompliant landowners were arrested;the number of identified heat sources was lower inrelation to the previous year; and the demand for envi-ronmental licenses increased.Box 7.4 Monitoring Efforts in Brazil Source: Nuguer\u00f3n and Stolle 2007.Discussions and proposals on how to set a reference level have centered around identifying rates of deforestation or land conversion (historical hectares per year deforested) by looking at several years of deforestation data (most likely interpreted from satellite images). The deforestation rateswould then be translated into a greenhouse gas emissionsrate (a reference level). New annual \"rates of deforestation\"would be compared against the reference level. A reduction in the rate of deforestation would, therefore, also translateinto a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which mightthen make the government or entity responsible for gettingemissions reduced eligible for financial compensation. Countries interested in REDD will need to, among other things, identify a baseline for carbon emissions and a rate offorest-cover change. While specific guidance will becomeavailable on determining baselines for forest cover and car-bon emissions, a country will clearly need to be able to set atarget that is based on a reduction from a certain referencelevel and quantify how much reduction in deforestationactually occurred if the government is to get credits. Histor-ical data and projected deforestation rates will be importantfor determining baselines. Appropriately set baselines helpensure that REDD initiatives are capturing and covering thecosts associated with reduced emissions but not creatingperverse incentives. National and international reporting obligations. Countries are obliged to report information related to theirforest sectors to a variety of international and regional con-ventions, agreements, and bodies (Braatz 2002). There are10 international instruments in force relevant to forests. 1 Parties to each of these instruments are asked to report on measures taken to implement their commitments underthe instrument. In most cases, reporting consists of quali- tative information on activities and means of implementa- tion (for example, policy, legislative, or institutional mea-sures). In a few cases, reporting also includes quantitativebiophysical and socioeconomic data on forest resources orresource use. These reports, and associated efforts to monitor and assess status and trends in forest resources and progress in meeting international commitments, help orient nationaland international policy deliberations (Braatz 2002). Accurate and consistent forest information at the global scale is still needed, specifically information on how much forest is lost annually and from where. The lack of such information is partly because previous efforts depended oninconsistent definitions of forest cover and used method-ologies that could not readily be replicated or were veryexpensive and time consuming (see box 7.5). The concern regarding national reporting burdens has been acknowledged in international forums for forest dia- logue. Since 2000, various efforts have attempted to harmo-nize national reporting on biological diversity (specificallyfor CBD (Convention on Biological Diversity), CITES (Con-vention on International Traded in Endangered Species),CMS (Convention on Migratory Species), the Ramsar Con- vention, and WHC (World Heritage Convention). In April2002, CBD, by Decision VI/22, adopted the expanded workprogram on forest biological diversity, which included as oneof its activities to \"seek ways of streamlining reportingbetween the different forest-r elated processes, in order to improve the understanding of forest quality change andimprove consistency in reporting on sustainable forest man-agement (SFM)\" (Conference of the Parties [COP] DecisionVI/22). These efforts all require reaching a common under-standing of forest-related concepts, terms, and definitions. Monitoring framework design. What is being moni- tored, how the information will be used and by whom, and the sustainability of a monitoring system should all informits design. Monitoring systems should be designed to beflexible and able to respond to a dynamic context, which canchange the scope and objective of monitoring. The moni-toring system design must consider the end user and sus- tainability of the system. Engagement of end users in thedesign and implementation of the system increases theirconfidence in the system and ensures its utility. Measurement framework. A measurement framework is helpful in designing the monitoring system. A measurement framework should have goals, criteria (the desirable end-points), indicators for each criteria (how well each criteria isbeing fulfilled), and approaches (qualitative or quantitative) for measuring the indicators. The goals and desired out- comes should guide identification of specific indicators. Insystems that integrate conservation and production, a hier-archy of goals can be established. Some may be broad, uni-versal goals and others may be more specific (yet have some universal applicability). When choosing a framework, various alternatives that have been tested and implemented should be considered, asshould new ones. Ideally, preference should be given to theframework already in use in the country, for example, theCriteria and Indicators framework used by the nine regionalCriteria and Indicators processes (including the MinisterialConference on Protection of Forests in Europe), the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response model, or the ServicesModel framework implemented by Millennium Ecosystem 252 CHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENTCHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENT 253The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has played a key role over the past 50 years in providing for-est sector information at the global level, having recog- nized that reliable information and knowledge about for- est resources is essential for sound policy development,forest resource management, and integration with over-all sustainable development efforts in a country. Moni-toring, assessment, and reporting on forests and forest products are some of the main activities of the FAO. FAO's Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) program uses the concept of sustainable forest management andreports on six of the seven thematic elements commonamong the nine regional Criteria and Indicatorsprocesses. These elements include extent of forest resources, growing stock, biomass stock, carbon stock, forest health, forests under productive purposes, plan-tations, and removal of wood and nonwood forestproducts from forests (www.fao.org/forestry/fra). TheForest Sector Outlook studies (www.fao.org/forestry/site/5606/en), State of the World's Forests (www.fao.org/forestry/site/21407/en), and other FAO publicationsserve the seven thematic areas in achieving the overallmission of enhancing human well-being (see box figure). Information from the FRA is accepted by interna- tional processes, conventions, and agencies, such as CBD, IPCC, and the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), and by all countries. The FRA is a collaborative and participative effort of expertswithin and outside the FAO, and includes nationalexperts in all countries (members and nonmembers ofFAO). More than 800 such experts contributed to FRA 2005, and more than 170 officially nominated nationalcorrespondents provided and validated its contents. The information compiled by FAO's FRA is the most comprehensive to date. It relies on aggregatingnational-level forest inventory information, which isreported by countries to FAO, to provide a global pic- ture of forest cover and forest cover change every 10 years. Spatially explicit estimates of tree cover changebased on repeated measurements would provide muchneeded information beyond what is readily availablefrom the FRA. Such a spatial assessment would be use-ful in that it would provide comprehensive informa-tion that can be periodically updated, yield measures ofchange at the global scale, and help identify areas thatneed to be examined more closely.

Another good framework, although still being piloted and not yetimplemented at regional and global levels, is the \"Manual for Environmental and Economic Accounts\" (FAO 2004). Using existing and new methodologies. Advancements in methodology and technology are a constant phenome- non in forest monitoring, as evidenced by the advancements in remote sensing, a particularly useful tool for studying for-est change comprehensively and uniformly across time andspace. Remote sensing multiplies the value of field-plot dataand permits complete, wall-to-wall analyses. Spatial imagesfrom Landsat have been a workhorse for scientists interested in measuring changes in the distribution and condition of forests. A number of satellites have come online since Land-sat, several of which are useful for monitoring forests(USDA 2007). Other advancements in forest monitoringapproaches have been based on imaging radar data, whichworks in all weather conditions. Methodological advance-ments, too, such as simplifying and automating mapping offorest disturbances (USDA 2007), have been important. Older technologies, such as mobile data loggers and mobile communication, could be more effectively used formonitoring forest activities. Mobile telephone communica-tion can serve two purposes: It can increase the safety of field crews by giving them access to communication in casesof emergency, while also enabling online data entry to a cen-tral database. Advancements in software, such as GIS 2, also offer many possibilities for presentation of results and improved access to information. The use of some of the newer technologies is not without shortcomings. For example, the availability of reference data for digital image analysis or visual interpretation is one ofthe key problems in remote sensing-aided surveys. Theparameters that can be estimated using remote-sensing sur- veys often depend on the intensity of the field sampling.Area of forests, other wooded land, and other land types, as well as their changes, can be adequately measured withavailable remote sensing-aided surveys. In contrast, treestem volume and biomass, which are critical variables indetermining the status of the world's forests, require thor-ough field measurements for their estimation. Such limita-tions are constantly being dealt with. Cost of monitoring. Cost is often an important driver in designing monitoring systems. A frequently asked question is when and whether satellite imagery-based forest covermapping can substitute for forest inventory. Mapping stud-ies cost less than field work (if the necessary hardware andsoftware are available); need less planning, smaller teams,and less broad expertise; are partly independent of weather;and provide maps as the major product, which are usuallymore easily accepted and \"marketed\" than statistics andtables with error specifications. The type of analysis required often influences the cost. High-resolution images are notably more expensive than coarse images. T omppo and Czaplewski (2002) estimatedcosts for remote sensing under different resolutions andsampling options for regional and global surveys usingremote sensing and field data (see tables 7.2 and 7.3). The costs have since changed significantly, but this informationprovides an indication of the differences in costs. Selection of indicators. Assessing all benefits from forests over time is complicated, and only feasible if simpli- fications and approximations, such as indicators, areaccepted. Several international processes have developedcriteria and indicators for sustainable forest management. 254 CHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENTTable 7.2 Example of Number of Images and Estimated Costs for a Remote- Sensing Survey with Different Resolution and Sampling Options Number of images needed Imaging cost (US$ coverage coverage coverage coverage coverage coverage coverage Africa 6 97 331 3,309 58 951 8, 992 Asia 6 100 343 3,428 60 986 9, 315 Europe 4 73 251 2,511 44 722 6, 824 North and Central America 4 69 237 2,374 42 683 6, 453 Oceania 2 28 94 943 17 271 2, 564 South America 3 57 195 1,950 34 561 5, 299 T otal 25 424 1,451 14,515 255 4,174 39, Czaplewski 2002. MODIS and Landsat are NASA satellite imaging programs; Ikonos is is a commercial Earth observation satellite.The criteria express the objectives of forestry, as negotiated in political processes, but the identification of indicators fornational-level performance in meeting the criteria is more difficult. Indicators are seldom optimal because they often need to be generated from a rapid process and, therefore, are identi- fied based on the data that is available. Furthermore, indica-tors identified at an international level may not be consid- ered equally valid or important among participatingcountries. This raises the need to agree on internationallyaccepted criteria, but also develop national indicators. FUTURE PRIORITIES AND SCALING-UP ACTIVITIES The following activities should be given priority: building capacity and investing in technology for effec- tively monitoring land-use change assistance in effectively measuring forest cover and car-bon emissions at the project-intervention level and effec-tive integration of this information into national accounting systems on carbon emissions supporting research to develop improved and affordable methodologies and technologies for national forestinventories supporting development and maintenance of nationaland regional networks of forest-related monitoring NOTES 1.

In several countries, the basic country- wide information on the current state of forests and other ecosystems is inadequate, fragmentary, or outdated\u2014or allthree. Often the existing data at the national level are spec-ulative and largely based on reconnaissance-type invento-ries and unrealistic assumptions about forest production and the impact of human activities on the resource base. In many countries, reliable estimates of forest and ecosystem resources, consumption rate, and real economicpotential are still lacking. In such contexts, the awareness offorest values is low. The rates by which forest ecosystems change over time and the overall distribution of the lands supporting them is not precisely known. Furthermore,institutions for ensuring continued monitoring are weakand can require capacity building and access to currenttechnology to facilitate inventory. Implementation of national forest programs (see note 6.1, Using National Forest Programs to Mainstream Forest Issues)and national forest assessments requires monitoring to con-tribute to and guide the planning and implementation offorestry and natural resources-related programs and projects. An up-to-date national forest inventory provides numer- ous benefits (see box 7.6), including the following: makes possible the calculation of the value of forest assets and monitoring of degradation and restoration trends,thereby enabling (i) improved decision making on forest- related public expenditure and revenue policies; (ii) improved understanding of the role of forests in past, cur-rent, and future national income accounts; (iii) improvedenvironmental and governance management; and (iv)national reporting on important international conventions; improves the required planning and monitoring of the forest estate; 257National Forest InventoriesNOTE 7.1 A World Bank intervention in the forest sector of Bosnia and Herzegovina revisited the project'sinventory component and requested approval for allocating additional resources to this component because both the government and the World Bankappreciated the importance of this activity foreffective forest management. The initial efforts toundertake an inventory resulted in an increased focus on management for nontimber forest prod-ucts (NTFPs), recreation, hunting, and tourism.These have the potential to significantly increaserevenues on state and private forest lands. Cur-rently, for each cubic meter of wood extracted(worth about US$50), forest enterprises earn only about US$1 on NTFPs, including recreation and tourism. This 50:1 ratio compares unfavorably to a50:50 ratio (timber to NTFP) in Austria. Hence,there is much room for improvement. Likewise, measures to reduce illegal activities in the forests, to instill good management and plan-ning practices (that is, FMIS), and to certify forestsand promote log tracking schemes would help toopen the European Union market to Bosnianwood products, and thereby enable Bosnia andHerzegovina to obtain higher prices. Currently,Bosnian timber is locked out of portions of theexport market because major buyers, such as IKEA, have adapted procurement policies thatrequire good management and SFM certification.Forests inventories are a central component ofFMIS (see note 7.2, Establishing Forest Manage-ment Information Systems). Source: World Bank 2003.Box 7.6 Motivation for Forest Inventory in Bosnia and Herzegovinaenables implementation of action plans to combat illegal activities in the sector; increases knowledge on the extent and location of thecountry's forest assets for potential private investors inwood-processing industries; and enables FMIS and state forest inventory use for decisionmaking, monitoring, and planning, thereby helping tosupport the benefits of these tools. OPERATIONAL ASPECTS Operationalizing forest inventories requires great attentionto detail as well as to the big picture in the forest sector. 1 Clarity of the objective of the inventory and an assessment ofcapacity to implement the inventory are central to designinga proper forest inventory and ensuring that all (or most) of the important components are covered (see box 7.7). Inventory design. Areas to be included in the inventory must be clearly defined; for example, privately held forests, forests in areas that are considered nonforest, and tree resources on nonforest land (see box 7.8). It is equallyimportant to determine whether the inventory will be \"wallto wall,\" or based on samples. The objectives of the inven-tory and the sample should help confirm the statisticaldesign and the required level of accuracy. The objectivesalso help determine how often inventory reports should beupdated (annually, or every 5 or 10 years) and the way inwhich success will be measured. Success may not be solely afunction of precision, but also depend on transparency andtimeliness. If the objective is to estimate status and trends in the area of forest land; the volume, growth, and removal of forest resources; and the health and condition of the forest; important elements in a forest inventory will include sampling design\u2014how to have a nationally consistent assessment; observations and measurements; using remote sensing applications effectively, perhaps for - initial plot observation, - stratification (see box 7.9); conducting remote sensing and GIS research, including - map-based estimation and internet (see box 7.10), - map-based sustainability analyses. 258 CHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENTThe World Bank's intervention in Tanzania has an inventory component that includes setting up a specialized structure in the Forest andBee Keeping Department (FBD) for data collection;updating of information; training of inventory per- sonnel; developing norms and methods of invento- ries and assessments; helping define governmentpolicy in the area of knowledge generation, man-agement, dissemination, and the like; and creating a new baseline of information, complete in scope and harmonized with existing informationrequired by international reporting requirements (see box 7.12 for data collection model). Objectives of the project: Strengthen capability of FBD to collect, analyze, and update the needed information on forests and treesfor planning and sustainable management of the forestry resources. Prepare a national map based on harmonized clas- sification of forest and land uses and related defini-tions. Undertake a national forestry resource assessmentand develop a national database. Design specific and management-oriented inven-tory in priority areas and formulate projects. Outputs: Harmonized forest and land use classification sys-tem and maps of state and changes of state pro-duced based on remote sensing data. New baseline information, encompassing a widerange of data for both local and international users,generated and disseminated. Specific and management-oriented inventory inpriority areas designed and projects formulated.Box 7.7 Forest Inventory in Tanzania Source: FAO 2007. how to link the national inventory with (where available and relevant) existing stand (management) inventory. It is helpful to identify regions where different sampling and attribute intensities can be applied, such as remote or reserved areas. The same level of precision is not required insuch areas. If such an approach is adopted, it is important to decide whether aerial or ground sampling or both are to be used, by region; ensure that a core set of compatible results is availableacross all regions; and clarify the responsibilities of all groups involved. Cost of inventory. Cost is an important consideration in inventories. It is important when promoting forest invento- ries to determine the most cost-effective data collection and processing approaches; develop needed operational experience in the relevantdepartment or unit so that the inventory can be scaled upon a cost-effective and timely basis; and provide an estimate of the cost for implementing theinventory. Use of new technologies can help with cost concerns. However, cost should not be the sole driving force for NOTE 7.1: NATIONAL FOREST INVENTORIES 259If \"forests on the edge\" are to be included in the sample, a possible way of defining them would beto choose watersheds (approximately 1,000) with - at least 10 percent forest cover, and - at least 50 percent of forest in private owner- ship; and rank watersheds- by forest contributions,- by threats to forest contributions, and - by combination of contributions and threats. The inventory could be focused on watersheds with a high rank. Source: USFS 2007. Box 7.8 Example of Defining the Sample of Interest Initial plot observation and stratification can assist in identifying the areas that need to be measuredand those that can be excluded. If initial plot observation indicates an area is obviously a non- forest area, it does not need to be observed in thefield. This type of information can help classifysatellite imagery into homogeneous strata toincrease the precision of estimates. When stratifying forests, stratification must be distinguished from classification. It is possible to have large numbers of classifications and few strat-ification, or vice versa. For example, there may be21 classifications, stratified into forest and nonfor-est land; or the classification can be forest land and nonforest land, with four stratifications: forest, forest edge, nonforest edge, nonforest. Source: USFS 2007. Box 7.9 Plot StratificationInternet map-based estimation methods involve selecting a map of forest attribute, drawing polygon of any shape, and developing a selection estimation type that could be- sample-based estimate and standard error, or - pixel-based estimate and standard error (for small or user-defined areas). Within this process there are two relevant sets of images: (i) a \"reference set,\" which is made up of satellite image pixels with associated plots, and (i)a \"target set,\" which is the satellite image pixelswithout associated plots. Source: USFS 2007. Box 7.10 Map-Based Estimation Methods Practical considerations. Considerations to keep in mind when developing inventories include the following: difficulty of access to plots in large, remote areas; continuity of estimates when transitioning from a state- level inventory to a national level inventory; and selecting the technology. T echnology selection should ensure that a balanced approach is taken with regard to useof remote sensing. The extent to which remote sensing is used should be based on a clear understanding of what it is good for, what its strengths are, and the overall efficiencyof the inventory. For example, remote sensing may beeffective in identifying change, but not in classifying it. Remote sensing may also assist with stratification to improve precision. Data interpretation. Data interpretation is a critical part of inventories. If spatial data are being used, interpretation is often preceded by field reconnaissance to develop aninterpretation key. Interpretation of data can require the useof available historical air photographs; available thematicmaps; photos taken during the field trips; and descriptions ofthe vegetation in selected representative sites and forest andland use classes in selected, geo-referenced sites. Image inter-pretation can be carried out digitally. Photo-interpretationand classification must be followed by validation by air, fol-lowing selected transects all over the country. Capacity to conduct inventory. Capacity for executing an inventory is often lacking and can require additional sup- port (see box 7.7). In cases where capacity needs to be strengthened, a field manual and training program canassist in implementing the inventory. Linking Inventory to decision-making. Considerations regarding integrating the inventory data into decision-mak-ing processes should shape the inventory process from the beginning. Often inventories feed into larger forest manage-ment information systems (see note 7.2, Establishing Forest Information Management Systems). LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS Phased approach. Designing, coordinating, and conduct- ing national forest inventories can pose numerous chal- lenges. A phased approach, starting with inventories at a subnational scale, can help identify the most cost-effective and timely way of conducting a national-scale inventory. Draw on good practice. Drawing from good practice in countries where inventories are well-developed offers signif- icant assistance. For countries in the Europe and CentralAsia region, lessons from the United States, Canada, Swe-den, and Finland could be used. The national inventories inthe latter countries and other countries in the region pro-vide a good foundation. However, inventories from othercountries will not provide \"off-the-shelf\" approachesbecause of the details of the methods used. For example,plot densities may differ, and what can realistically beafforded may be different. Use current and well-tested technology. It is impor- tant to draw on current and well-tested technologies, to the extent possible. These technologies and the latest science ininventories can assist in designing a cost-effective system 260 CHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENTProject cost estimations often require numerous assumptions. In Tanzania, the following assumptionswere made for estimating the costs associated with mapping: The country is covered by 50 Landsat scenes. Procurement of the satellite images, training, and preparatory work for the mapping (equipment,manuals, interpretation key, preprocessing, and the like) require four months. One month of field reconnaissance is required at the onset of the project by three people\u2014thus, threeperson-months of work.One person interprets one scene in three weeks, onaverage. This gives a total of 35 working months orup to 12 months work for 4 people. Field and air checking require two months of threepeople, or a total of six person-months. Revision and finalization of the map requires aboutthree months of three people or nine person-months. Storage of the map in the database and reproduc-tion of the map in hard copies will take two monthsfor three people\u2014or six person-months. The total person-months for mapping by techni-cians is 24 months /H110033 people = 72 person-months.Box 7.11 Estimating Costs Source: FAO 2007. with a high probability of successful implementation. At the beginning of the project, the project team should undertakethe necessary consultations to find out the quality of the available data (for example, cloud free, right season), and at what cost. In some countries, much is already known abouttechnical options, but the organizational and financialaspects are lacking. In implementing national forest inven-tories, it is important to clarify the objectives of inventories and articulate the responsibilities of the various groupsinvolved. Ensure new and previous inventories can be linked. The way national forest inventories are linked to previousinventories needs to be closely examined to ensure that thecurrent inventories are seen as reliable and credible.Country specific considerations. In some countries it will be important to develop a mechanism for handling forests under land mines. NOTE 1.

NOTE 7.1: NATIONAL FOREST INVENTORIES 261Data collection methods might combine multiple approaches. In Tanzania, two complementary methodswere used for data collection. The first was from a net- work of field samples distributed along a systematic grid. The second was from mapping using remote-sensing techniques. The field sampling was arranged insample sites composed of clusters. Each cluster con-tained four plots of 5,000 m 2. The plots were designed to monitor the dynamic of changes of the land-use systems and of the forest and tree cover in the country. It was a one-phase sampling for continuous forest inventory. The data collection follows the model in the figure. For each sample unit there were several levels of data collection, corresponding to different data sets.Data sets included local populations; forest and treeproducts and services, and users, which were tied to theland-use class; and land use-level data with informa- tion on protection status, vegetation coverage, environ-mental problems, and tree characteristics (species,height, diameter, health) attached to the plot where thetrees were found.Box 7.12 A Data Collection Model Source: FAO 2007.

CROSS-REFERENCED CHAPTERS AND NOTES Note 6.1: Using National Forest Programs to Mainstream Forest Issues Note 7.2: Forest Management Information Systems 262 CHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENTMonitoring of projects, activities, and, more broadly, land-use practices has become moresophisticated, cost effective and, where relevant, participatory. The application and use of monitoring approaches in the forestry sector have been expanded toassess progress in projects and programs and to identifyaspects that need modification (see chapter 7, Monitoringand Information Systems for Forest Management). What is an FMIS? An FMIS is an information technology (IT) system used as an aid for planning and monitoring for- est management and conservation activities. The FMIS canpotentially manage a wide range of spatial and alphanu-meric data. Potential applications include its use in forestclassification and mapping, rangeland and wildlife manage-ment, timber inventory (including projections of growthand yield), and for planning sustainable use and conserva-tion of forest products and biological goods and services. Integrating management processes and appropriate computer-based tools can greatly enhance the effectivenessof gathering and storing data and then transforming it(using models and analytical processes) into useful infor-mation for the sustainable management and conservationof forest resources. However, these tools also require greatcare and planning in their development because they are expensive and time consuming to develop and maintain.Start-up costs include hardware and software acquisition,staff training, and data entry, the combination of whichcould consume about 80-90 percent of project budgets. Who could use FMIS and how? Various users (private companies, state forestry agencies, ministries of agriculture or forestry, NGOs, scientists and academics, donor agencies,and more) would have different needs for an FMIS, includ-ing forest monitoring and research, as well as the more tra-ditional forest management planning. Private industry uses FMIS to better manage timberlands and the fiber supply chain from the forest managementunit (FMU) level onward. FMIS can also support multi- objective forestry as required by forest certification schemes, laws, or policies. Government agencies use FMIS to plan the management of forest lands for multiple uses (fiber supply, tourism,biodiversity conservation, watershed management, and other environmental services). Government uses for such systems (the focus of this note) will differ by institutionalstructure and land and forest ownership patterns. 1 OPERATIONAL ASPECTS FMIS architecture. Establishing an FMIS is not just \"computerizing\" existing hard copy systems of forest management. FMISs have a standard system architecture (see box 7.13), but the complexity and sophistication of this architecture can vary depending on whether theFMIS serves specific projects or small operations or ispart of wider corporate tools for large industry or gov-ernment use. The architecture of an FMIS should be com- patible with organizational and management needs and,while recognizing the limitations of current managementcapability and data availability, should be flexible enoughto allow for the incorporation of improved managementprocesses, new data, and new technologies. Design and selection guidelines. The FMIS is essen- tially a computer system, requiring hardware and software, as well as data, to be useful. Selecting the right hardware andsoftware requires a good understanding of the system'sneeds and applications, as well as the frequency of use of thevarious applications. Consequently, technology and appli-cations specialists are needed to help with the design,startup, and debugging of a system. 263Establishing Forest Management Information SystemsNOTE 7.2264 CHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENTThe following are the interconnected modules that would comprise a standard FMIS: Forest Land Information Module. This module would contain information on the current status ofthe forest, as well as information encapsulating the best current knowledge of how the forest develops and reacts to management actions and stochasticevents (such as fire, pests, and disease). The modulewould normally include the following:-Land-use database. Basic attributes for various units of land, often including their location, area, legal status, administrative unit, land use/cover,and so forth. This relational database containingthe attributes data would normally be linked to aGIS (map) database where the spatial data, in theform of polygons, are stored. -Physical infrastructure database. Information about the infrastructure (road network, bridges,dams) available for supporting forest manage-ment on the land base in question (these wouldnormally be viewed as layers in the GIS database). -Forest inventory system. Information about each unit of land that is of concern. This informationwill include such data as forest cover type, treespecies and vegetation, basal area, volumes, siteclass, terrain conditions, and any other forestinformation required for managing (analyzing,planning, and monitoring) the forest. The infor-mation would be periodically updated through interfaces with the growth and yield model, theoperations tracking module, and the resourcemonitoring systems. -Growth and yield models. Models describing the natural development of forest types over time(growth) and the values (timber and nontimberforest products, revenues) that can be obtainedat the various stages of development (yield).There are many kinds of growth and yield mod-els, including stand-level models for a forest typein a specific geographic region, and single-treemodels specific to a particular species. Single-tree modeling tends to be more flexible, butstand (or forest-type) models would usually bemore appropriate for national-, regional-, orstate-level forest management. -Forest transition models (or ecological scenario models). Models that describe the changes in aspecific forest stand (or type, if on a national scale) as a result of some specific intervention (such as certain kinds of harvesting, stand estab-lishment, and stand tending actions). -Forest monitoring systems. Although possibly in - cluded in the Forest Inventory System described in note 7.1, additional forest resource and biodi-versity monitoring systems that may be requiredfor purposes of administrative oversight, qualitycontrol, and compliance with the criteria and indicators of a forest certification scheme. Forest Resource Planning Module (also known as harvest scheduling module). Using much of the information in the Forest Land Information Mod- ule, the GIS and, in more sophisticated systems, the Operations Management module (described below),this module is used to forecast and plan the develop-ment of the forest and the flow of products and ser-vices (or forest values, including those related to ecosystem conservation). The planning is generallyset up to cover a significant time horizon (oftenmore than one rotation of the major tree species),thus allowing the resulting plan to be labeled \"sus-tainable.\" The kinds of planning systems availablerange from simple forecasting models to simulation models through to optimization models. The model type appropriate to a particular situation dependsupon management goals (strategic or tactical) aswell as on the availability of good forest data. Operations Management Module. This is the mecha- nism for making changes to ongoing management activities and is well developed in commercial forest applications. This module is designed to facilitate stand-level planning, scheduling, and monitoring ofall major forestry activities, including stand estab-lishment, tending and harvesting, product sales andtransportation, forest protection, and road con- struction. Costs, revenues, and production resultsshould be gathered and used for this planning,although some or most of that information maycome from an accounting or business informationmanagement system (described below). An opera-tions management system should be capable of reporting on all relevant activities and operational results for purposes of management control, as wellas to verify compliance with any regulations, forestcertification, or quality control requirements thatmight apply.Box 7.13 System Architecture of a Standard FMIS Many on-line resources are available for software design, development, and implementation, as well as for the improvement of management processes.2Beyond these well-developed process rules, the following is a suggestedprotocol for macro-level FMIS design, development, and implementation. (See box 7.14 for an example of applica- tion of FMIS in Bosnia and Herzegovina.) Needs analysis. This step, led by a management team task force, is critical for ensuring that the proposed investment will provide an integrated set of tools that meets the needsof everyone involved in the analysis, planning, monitoring,and control of forest management strategies, tactics, andoperations. The task force should be educated about whatthe new FMIS might do for them before they are able toprovide helpful input to the design process. System conceptual design. The system strategy and vision would be developed by the forestry management team task force, working together with application, GIS, andIT specialists. All direct and indirect users should be con-sulted, while IT specialists should provide advice concern-ing capabilities and modalities. The needs definition andsystem design are most often iterative processes, as gaps or constraints identified in the system design phase reinformthe needs analysis. Design document. The design document should do the following: Articulate the vision, goals, and objectives (short- and long-term) of the system, as well as initial recommenda-tions concerning development priorities and proposed timelines for the development phases. Identify and address all of the infrastructure and resources available and required to make the system use-ful and sustainable, including those related to data acqui- sition, communication technology, operating costs, training, and technical support. Articulate the physical, fiscal, and organizational con- straints so that the IT specialists can design a system thatcan be implemented and supported. System designs should be based on structures, processes, and resources that are available beyond the life of the project (it wouldbe appropriate to identify the compromises that havebeen made and the reasons for these). NOTE 7.2: ESTABLISHING FOREST MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 265Business Information Management System (BIMS) Module. This module would allow for the entry, storage, and processing of all data and information related to the basic business processes of the organi- zation, such as accounting, invoicing, personnelmanagement, and scheduling activities (job orders).It would normally be closely linked to the OperationsManagement module and may even provide much of the information needed for operational control. Geographic Information System (GIS). This would provide visual access to all of the cartographic infor- mation needed by the FMIS. GIS spatial analysis, modeling, and presentation capabilities are essential for good forest planning and management of large,complex forests, such as those on a national scale. The overall system would have many types of users\u2014from those who simply enter data to managersand forest analysts. Modules should be \"co-designed\" and linked so that the management processes they sup-port are integrated and duplication of data entry is avoided. Because some information may need to be consid- ered confidential, and to accommodate the range of userneeds, different access levels may be built into the devel-oping system. Hence, while a system may be compre- hensive and fully integrated, specific users would onlyhave access to the information that they need to use fortheir own job. At the same time, it is critical that all thedata are entered in standardized form so as to be com- patible across the system for all users at all levels. More-over, if jurisdictions charged with the management oradministration of forests (countries, regions, provinces,or states) were to adopt such compatible systems, this would greatly help to standardize data and help makecomparisons across countries easier to accomplish.Box 7.13 System Architecture of a Standard FMIS (continued) Source: Robak and Kirmse 2007.Technology specifications. The specific technologies3to be employed depend on the conceptual design and perfor- mance specifications, which should, in turn, take into account the infrastructure and resources (human, technical, and financial) that are available to the organization, inter-nally or from service organizations with a local (or, moreoften these days, online) presence. Additional considera-tions include the following:The programming language of the software should be one that is most appropriate and ideally, widely used. The databases and software should be able to handle thelarge number of transactions, ensure the security requiredin some applications, have the necessary long-term techni- cal support, and not become obsolete in the short-term. 4 The total cost of operation, rather than the initial start- up costs, should be the focus over the life of the project. 266 CHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENTThe following planning steps were employed in an FMIS project in Bosnia and Herzegovina that involveddeveloping a unified network-based system: a) Conduct a gap analysis of the planning capacity of the various enterprises and agencies. b) Organize workshops to agree on approach with the stakeholders. c) Organize an FMIS Working Group (FMIS-WG)\u2014 comprising foresters, IT specialists, business man- agers, and inspection and planning officers\u2014whowould function as a process advisory group todefine the basic data (including the minimum dataneeds for central planning and control functions) needed by the Cantonal Forest Management Com- panies (CFMCs). d) The FMIS-WG should organize a workshop to demonstrate the power of a comprehensive FMISand to agree on the basic data needs and on the over-all development process. State-of-the-art softwareproviders (such as ESRI and Oracle), as well as users(for example, the Hungary forest enterprise associa-tion, the Polish State Forest Management Agency)should be invited to give presentations. Key repre-sentatives of the CFMCs and the ministerial andcantonal administrations should be invited to par-ticipate and the conclusions and recommendations should be recorded and disseminated. The mainproduct of this workshop should be an agreed onconcept of a centralized system as well as a processfor developing that system. Agreement also needs tobe reached as to the overall coordination of theprocess and on the \"home\" for the central database.Time required: three months planning and imple-mentation. Coordinated by the Forest Developmentand Conservation Project's (FDCP) project imple-mentation unit (PIU) with help from the FMIS-WG.e) Designate the institutional coordinator for the FMIS development process and establish the institutional home for the central database. This is the responsi- bility of the ministry. All further development depends on this key step to designate and equip the\"FMIS coordinator.\" f) Prepare the tender package for designing the FMIS (international consultant, working with the FMIS- WG). At a minimum, the terms of reference (TOR)should include (i) an analysis of the existing situa-tion and review of the data needs; (ii) a comparativeanalysis of international experience with similarsystems to ensure the most cost-effective approach;(iii) the final design of the data module, the data format, and the presentational standards, taking into account any relevant government IT policy;and (iv) the programming, communications, hard-ware, and software customization. Time required:five months contracting and preparation. Coordi-nated by the FMIS coordinator, with input from theFMIS-WG. g) Organize a follow-up workshop to agree on the FMIS tender package, and to seek funding sources.Invite possible donors as well as government officials to agree on the TOR and to secure fund-ing. Coordinated by the FMIS coordinator, withhelp from the international consultant and the FMIS-WG. h) T ender the development phase per the agreed TOR. Time required: eight months. i) Design the database system. Time required: six months. j) T ender the remaining hardware and software.k) Install the system, including training. In this case, the overall development process was estimated to take about two years. Box 7.14 FMIS in Bosnia and Herzegovina Source: Robak and Kirmse 2007.If the application specifications are more complex, the most cost-effective approach would normally be to con-sider an already developed application or integrated multi-application system, where the provider is capable of adapting that system to the special needs of theclient. 5 Developers or providers should not be forced to adopt one development environment. Instead, data interchangeand interoperability rules should be adopted and enforced, allowing the replacement of old applications or addition of new ones in a \"plug-and-play\" 6approach to system evolution. System detailed design and development. The applica- tion of an iterative design and development process may bemore effective in producing an end product that finds wide-spread acceptance in a large organization. Coupled with awell-thought-out prototyping approach or the use of mock- ups, the risk of large project failures is greatly reduced andthe likelihood of end user buy-in is greatly increased. System implementation and training. For implement- ing complex systems in large forestry organizations, the application of a pilot area approach, followed by phasedroll-outs of the tested system, seems to be an effective strat-egy. End users should be involved in the design and devel-opment process to facilitate their understanding of andsense of ownership in the software and reduce implementa-tion problems and training time. Training of the end users(especially foresters and other professionals) should focuson the process that the system is supposed to support. If thesystem (and user interface) is well designed, a good under-standing of the processes that it is meant to support willensure that the system will be used properly. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS FMIS has recently become a popular component of World Bank projects (such as in Argentina, Bosnia and Herzegov-ina, Kazakhstan, Russia, Romania), but the development and implementation of these systems has been slow. Hence, there is inadequate experience from which to build standarddesign, development, and implementation protocols orcompilations of lessons learned within the context of WorldBank projects. Previous FMIS projects in India (Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh) have a longer track record,although they were also plagued with missed milestones andeventual loss of focus. Some key lessons follow: Constancy with respect to FMIS responsibility within the bureaucracy. Given the frequency of person- nel transfers in bureaucratic systems, it is helpful to developa cadre of specialists to provide long-term technical supportfor FMIS implementation and operation. Understanding and buy-in regarding modern forest management and its requirements at critical levelsof the management hierarchy. It is important that man- agers realize that an FMIS should not simply \"computerize\"the traditional management processes. Reasonable goals for the initial development phases. While it is always necessary to keep in mind the nature and capabilities of the FMIS that must be developed, eventually, to support good fo rest management, the goals of the project must recognize the constraints and capabilitiesof the organization. It is far better to set realistic near-termgoals within the context of a well-articulated, long-termdevelopment plan than to attempt to turn around an entirebureaucracy in one go. Vision or agreement as to what form such systems should take. The focus should be on spatial decision mak- ing and not on acquisition and maintenance of data, that is,let the process drive the system design. Time and effort mustbe spent on formulating a vision and strategy for the IT sys-tem and the new management processes that it is intendedto serve, and on defining very specific objectives. Only afterthose have been defined can a TOR be formulated (seeannex 7.2B to this note) and the detailed design and devel-opment phase begin. Realistic, phased development for a large, complex system. This is necessary for a bureaucracy to have time to adapt to new management processes and gain confidencefrom a series of \"mini-successes.\" Given the rapid development of FMIS technology, the development process should include two critical considera- tions: (i) the contracting of an FMIS specialist to lead theoverall decision making and design process; and (ii) a com- parison of the cost effectiveness of developing a system fromscratch or adapting an already designed system (that is,procuring a turnkey system, in which the company wouldinstall the system and provide training). The turnkey approach would probably cost a fraction of what it wouldcost to develop a system from scratch and would take muchless time, hence addressing some of the development prob-lems mentioned above (see box 7.15). The value of a tested NOTE 7.2: ESTABLISHING FOREST MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 267and client-rich system, which would also aid an organiza- tion (especially one new to the technology) in thinking\"outside the box,\" cannot be overstated. NOTES 1. Some World Bank client countries (the Russian Federa- tion, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kazakhstan, Roma- nia, and most all other Commonwealth of Independent States and Eastern European countries) operate like privatecompanies because the governments own the forest and have their own enterprises (called Leskhozes in Russia, Kaza- khstan, and Belarus, and Forest Management Units inBosnia and Herzegovina) for management and harvestingoperations. Thus, they are responsible for tactical as well as strategic planning. In Argentina, Chile, or Brazil, for exam-ple, where much of the productive forest is private, the pub-lic sector would, in fact, have less of a tactical role and wouldrequire mainly the strategic planning functions that a scaled-back FMIS would offer. 268 CHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENTCompany Country Product Web Site American Forest U.S. Cypress, Harvest Scheduling Software http://www.americanforestmanagement.com Management Inc.

The \"plug-n-play\" principle in large system design is one that says that the system should be built (and documented)in such a way that, as new, better technology componentsbecome available, the old component could be \"unplugged\"and the new one could be \"plugged in\" in a seamless manner.For example, the FMIS should be designed so that when anew forest inventory system becomes available, the develop-ers of that new system would simply need to know the rulesfor exchanging data with other components (planning pack-ages, GIS, and the like) and any other usage and security pro-tocols, and develop an interface and \"plug it in\" to the FMIS.

NOTE 7.2: ESTABLISHING FOREST MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 269The TOR for a specific FMIS project should be drawn up only after the vision and strategy for the desired system havebeen developed. Nevertheless, the following may help form the basis of a TOR. TERMS OF REFERENCE DEVELOPING A NATIONAL FMIS Summary and Instructions This section should provide an executive summary of the project, including a description of the broad objectives andscope of the FMIS project; the sources and timing of financing; and the project management responsibilities and protocols. Background This section sets the broad context for the FMIS project and provides justification for the goals and scope of the FMIS project and the development approach to be taken. In most cases, an FMIS project is intended to do more than provide new IT support for existing forest management processes; itwill require and support new management and decisionprocesses. However, any intended \"re-engineering\" of man-agement processes should be made explicit, otherwise resis- tance to change will be difficult to overcome and FMISdesign will lack focus. Specific Objectives of the Assignment An FMIS project should normally be divided into at least two (and possibly three) phases and contracts that would involve 1) the identification of the forest management decision processes that the FMIS is intended to support, with a detailed description of the context that should informthe project management process and drive and constrainthe design and development phases, and a broad descrip- tion of the functionalities of the proposed FMIS; 2) a system design process resulting in clear design specifi- cations that are justified in terms of that context andproject goals; and 3) a system development and implementation process based upon the design specifications and the projectmanagement process.Objectives and Context\u2014Phase I. The first contract would manage the consultative process for developing the detailed objectives that the FMIS will support and clearlydefining the context of the system. The contextual informa-tion that should be provided would include a) a summary of the forest inventory, categorized and char- acterized in terms of uses, values, tenure, and manage- ment structures; b) the status of current forest policies, strategies, and plans at the national, regional, district, and individual forest areas; c) the current state of knowledge concerning the status and dynamics of the forest resources to be managed; d) a summary of the major influences on and challenges to good management (including knowledge gaps, publicpolicy trends, land use and tenure issues, public atti-tudes, and illegal activities); e) current uses and values (economic, environmental, and social) of the forest and an identification of the benefici-aries and stakeholders; f) the laws, regulations, and regulatory and management structures (including but not limited to the organizationof the forest service) that influence and direct forestmanagement; g) the status of the communication and IT infrastructure (including data quantity and quality) in the country, classified by region and according to the forest servicehierarchy; h) internal and external technical support capabilities with respect to the IT and communication infrastructure; i) human resources policies that may have an impact on developing an IT cadre in the forest service (even if much of the work is outsourced, there needs to be a core ofmanagement that understands and directs IT develop- ment over the long term); and j) the current level of knowledge and capacities regarding forest management, business (or organizational) manage-ment, and information technologies in the forest service and other allied or support organizations that are involvedin the analysis, planning, implementation, and control offorest resources and forest management activities. Based upon the above context, the FMIS design objectives and project management modalities should be clearly described and explicitly justified. This work should include a description of functionalities, an identification of users 270 CHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENTANNEX 7.2A MODEL TERMS OF REFERENCE(direct and indirect) and usage patterns and processes, as well as a description of the data requirements and datasources. If the FMIS development is to coincide with man- agement process changes, the links between the FMIS proj- ect and process change initiative should be clearly delineated. Detailed Design\u2014Phase II. The main tasks of this phase of the work are to a) develop the detailed design specifications for the FMIS; b) review and analyze existing FMIS and support technolo- gies in relation to the specifications; c) review possible methods for the development of the FMIS (adapting existing technologies, developing com-ponents \"from scratch\" using in-house or externalexpertise) 1; d) recommend (with justification) the preferred develop- ment method (which may well include a combination of the above); e) estimate the human resources requirements (including commitment from client personnel), time, and cost of the installed FMIS; and, f) consolidate the above information into a document that outlines the critical elements of the Development and Implementation TOR. In principle, it should not be the task of this consultant to recommend the specific development environment or database and support technologies to be used because the design specifications and the context description (especiallythose related to local IT capabilities) should be clear enoughthat any inappropriate technologies would not be proposedor, if proposed, would not be chosen. However, the designconsultant should develop a draft Development and Imple-mentation TOR that recommends the software develop-ment, quality assurance, and project management standardsand protocols that should be used by the developer, includ-ing those that facilitate future system evolution and com-patibility with other national and international forestry andenvironmental systems. Development and Implementation\u2014Phase III. The fol- lowing is a list of issues that would likely need to be addressed in the Development and Implementation TOR: Software design specifications and performance criteria, including those related to specific functionalities;national and international data standards that must befollowed (such as European numerical data standards); reports to be produced; spatial visualization and model-ing capabilities; data entry protocols; security and access;description of users (including working language) andusage patterns (including multiuser and web-enabledcapabilities); integration among FMIS components;interfaces and integration with existing or proposednon-FMIS systems; minimum data auditing and datarecovery; and back-up and archiving requirements. Characteristics of software technologies to be emp loyed, including recommendations concerning which elementsshould be built from scratch and which should be adapted from existing technologies. This should also ad dress issues concerning the flexibility and resiliency of any sys-tem being proposed, including its degree of adherence to\"plug-n-play\" principles and open source 2standards. Hardware specifications (including those related to oper- ating environment, health, and ergonomics) and rulesand regulations that govern hardware acquisition. Description of data preparation work required, includ-ing (as appropriate) data migration and conversion;preparation of base and thematic maps; forest and land recharacterization; and acquisition, analysis, and incor- poration of remote sensing imagery and data. Description of the current forest management and IT knowledge of proposed users and internal IT supportpersonnel, and the level that is desired. This means that, where appropriate, the TOR must specify the education and training required to use the system to maximize thebenefits, not simply train people about \"which buttons topush.\" Minimum requirements related to implementation and training, technical and user documentation, and systemsupport. Minimum software and project management qualityassurance protocols to be employed. Description of the minimum level of long-term supportthat will be required to be provided by the developmentand implementation contractors. Description of the commitment from the clients withrespect to the engagement of its people in the develop-ment, testing, implementation, and training processes. Evaluation Criteria T ender documents should be evaluated according to thequality of the tender in relation to the requirements of theTOR and then according to the following criteria: NOTE 7.2: ESTABLISHING FOREST MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 271expertise of the consultancy team experience and track record in similar FMIS projects proposed cost of development, implementation, and training estimated cost and requirements (especially those rela-ted to human resources) for continued operation of thesystem estimated ongoing maintenance and support costs technologies, protocols, and standards proposed (includ-ing facilitation of future development and evolution ofthe system) intellectual property ownership and rights realism of schedules realism and acceptability of commitment required of theclient ability to provide long-term support Specific tasks Besides the work described above, specific tasks and operat-ing methods are suggested as ways to increase the likelihoodof success in an FMIS project. Most of these are related to education, communication, and participation. Phase I. Interview officials who are responsible for the strate- gic direction of the organization to gauge their clarity of pur- pose and understanding of modern forest management and the capabilities of IT. Undertake a review of the context inwhich the FMIS must fit. Based upon the results of theseinterviews and the evaluation of the context, design and holda workshop that fills knowledge gaps and leads to a consensuson the objectives and strategies of the FMIS on the part of upper management. T o ensure the outcomes of the workshop are appropriate: The various user groups in an organization need to be educated about what the new FMIS might do for them.Often they do not have a clear idea about how an FMIS might work and what it implies for their work processes. It needs to be made clear that the FMIS is not just about computerizing their existing manual processes. Existingwork processes may need careful review and redesign as a prelude to the detailed design and development of the FMIS, which adds to the size of the task. The FMIS project design should recognize that the requirements of an FMIS will change over time, as willthe technologies employed. It should be recognized that other government agencies(related to land and water management and agriculture,for example) may maintain databases that could aug- ment the FMIS and vice versa. It is not efficient, from anoverall government perspective, to duplicate data-gath-ering and storage efforts or, even worse, to have agenciesdevelop incompatible systems. After a consensus on objectives and strategies has been reached, present the conceptual design recommendationsto upper management (articulating the needs, functional- ities, and development strategy; estimating costs and time needed for the various development options and for thevarious functionalities; reviewing and disseminatinginformation on the various turn-key options) for theirapproval. Upon receiving this approval, the conceptual design (with functionalities) should be presented tointended users of the FMIS, to get their feedback and sug-gestions for improvements. It is strongly recommendedthat a well-defined and stable user group sign off on thefinal design (and then monitor the development of the FMIS). An agreed on process of staged development and implementation is necessary to avoid future conflictswithin the user group or between users and developers. Phase II. The design phase will require that interviews and workshops be held with all major user groups, first to helpestablish draft design specifications, then to gain acceptance ofthe final specifications and the major elements of the Devel-opment and Implementation TOR (including acceptance oftheir responsibilities in the development, testing, implementa-tion, and training processes). Successful implementation of anFMIS will require, or will be undertaken in combination with, work process changes, which may necessitate a cultural changein an organization. The human resources management issuesmust be considered, both in terms of the FMIS requirementsand their impacts upon the FMIS project. Phase III. An important element that should not be forgot- ten in the development, testing, implementation, and training phases is the ongoing communication and feedback processesthat must be developed and maintained to ensure the bestpossible final product, reduction in lost time due to misun-derstandings, and eventual buy-in from the users. It shouldbe made clear to Phase III bidders that their proposals will beevaluated in part by how well they have responded to thisrequirement. Process and Reporting Arrangements Specify the line agency to which the consultants would report. That is, specify the agency that would be managing 272 CHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENTthe overall development phase of the FMIS and, if different, the agency that would operate the system. Implementation of this assignment should aim to be inclusive and transparent and should specifically seek to engage a broad range of stakeholders, including forest own-ers (public and private); forest managers (public and pri-vate); conservation and protected areas managers; thewood-using industries; the profession; researchers and academics; relevant gov-ernment ministries, such as finance and environment; andthe international agencies supporting the forest sector. Duration Experience shows that the full development and installation (with training) takes much more time than planned.Although it would vary with the size and complexity of the system being contemplated, in general an FMIS developed \"from scratch,\" using no or few existing FMIS components,would probably take five to seven years to full implementa-tion, while the adaptation and installation of an alreadydeveloped system may take two to three years. A good, well- used FMIS may never be \"completed,\" but rather will evolvewith a changing understanding of needs and with changesin technologies and technological capabilities within userand support groups. Expertise Required The Phase I consultancy should be led by a forester who has a clear understanding of modern forest management princi-ples, processes, and information requirements. The Phase II consultancy should include a forester who has worked on the development of FMIS elsewhere, supported by an IT special-ist with experience in developing standards for the manage-ment of large-scale IT projects. As is the case in the Phase I consultancy, the \"FMIS forester\" should have knowledge ofthe principles of modern, sustainable forest managementand demonstrated experience in applying those principles inthe design, development, and implementation of Manage- ment Information Systems and Decision Support Systemtools in a variety of contexts for forestry organizations. In Phase III, the bidders (normally international FMIS consulting firms) should propose the mix of expertise andtype and level of experience that they believe will best suitthe achievement of the objectives. NOTES 1. There is a tendency on the part of local and in-house IT specialists to want to develop a system in-house. However, World Bank experience shows that this is very time con- suming and costly; more costly than adapting an existing system. Most firms that develop and market systems providethe implementation and training expertise needed to gettheir systems up and running. 2. Open source standards for software and data (including spatial data) are being developed in Europe and North America to reduce the likelihood that users are \"trapped\" bya specific manufacturer or technology. For example, for along time ESRI used a proprietary data format that made itdifficult (if not impossible or illegal) for other GIS or GIScomponent suppliers to tap into the ARC/Info data. So even when someone came along with a better technology, the user could not upgrade technologies without a huge andexpensive effort. In general, \"open-source\" does not meanthat developers cannot maintain their trade secrets\u2014theydo not have to show their source code\u2014it just means thatthere is an agreement to adhere to codes and standards (forexample, the use of metadata dictionaries) that ensure aclient is not trapped by a particular technology. NOTE 7.2: ESTABLISHING FOREST MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 273Remote sensing (RS) has become part of most forest management strategy implementations. While thetechnology for RS has evolved, aerial photography has been in use for almost a century, and satellites have been recording forest change for more than 35 years. Landsat,launched in 1972, was one of the first satellites widely usedfor remote sensing. Since then, Landsat has been a work-horse for scientists interested in measuring changes in the distribution and condition of forests. Remote sensing (aer-ial flights, aerial photography, optical and radar satelliteimagery) and GIS have aided forest mapping and forestinventories for many years. Two trends have stimulated the rise of spatial monitor- ing. First, technological advances in RS/GIS make thesetools more accessible; human capacity to manipulate thisdata has also increased while information has become moreaccurate, less expensive, and more freely circulated. In addi-tion, there is a wider choice of satellites, prices of satelliteshave deceased significantly, 1the Internet is widely used to share data, and more affordable and more user-friendly RS/GIS software is now readily available. Second, in addition to these technical advances, a variety of needs are increasing demand for forest monitoring. The impetus to monitor comes from, among other things, theneed to assess national-level compliance with internationalconventions, and measure global public goods (for exam- ple, carbon sequestration, area under protection for conser-vation purposes, and the like). RS/GIS technology providesthe data and the tools needed for monitoring by enablingprecise overlays between different time periods within spe-cific boundaries, and by storing and analyzing the data. However, because inventories and mapping are frequently time intensive and expensive, they are often carried out onlyin specific regions or for specific purposes. T o date, only sixattempts to map forests worldwide exist. Various local, national, and international entities sys- tematically collect, examine, and disseminate data aboutforest resources throughout the world. Nevertheless, effortsat these different levels to systematically collect, examine,and disseminate data about forest resources are done inde-pendently of one another, and use different definitions andmeasurements. Accordingly, comparison of results is diffi-cult, major knowledge gaps remain in large areas, andduplications exist in others. Only a few countries use spatialinformation for national forest inventories that are updatedand suitable to address current environmental issues (seeboxes 7.16 and 7.17 for examples). Spatial monitoring has become increasingly important in the context of REDD. For REDD, even minimum requirements to develop national deforestation databasesusing typical and internationally agreed on methods willrequire using RS data. The data would help assess grossdeforestation, possibly develop a map of national forestarea, and present a visual representation of forest cover change. Spatial monitoring, in some cases, is already part ofdiscussions for monitoring land use, land-use change andforestry (LULUCF) (see box 7.18). Independent of demand, there are challenges to effective spatial monitoring of forests: Availability of RS data. Detailed data (that is, certain satellite sensors and aerial photographs) must beordered in advance and may not be available in the short term. Clouds often hamper monitoring in the tropics and in mountainous areas, and can become a majorproblem, especially for data acquired with less frequency(for example, it can take more than a year to get adetailed resolution image with less than 30 percent cloud cover in Indonesia). Because higher temporal resolutionsatellites acquire data more often, they have better oppor-tunities to acquire imagery with fewer clouds. Anotheralternative is the use of radar satellites because radar sen-sors \"see\" through clouds. Nevertheless, radar applica- tions for forest monitoring are still uncommon. Spatial Monitoring of ForestsNOTE 7.3 274NOTE 7.3: SPATIAL MONITORING OF FORESTS 275Cameroon has made significant commitments and notable progress in monitoring forest-based activities.These commitments have launched initiatives to pro- duce and compile forest information and improve the quality and availability of relevant forest data, in partto enable better decision making. In 2005, a partnership that included the Cameroon Ministry of the Environment and Forests (MINEF), Global Forest Watch, the Limbe Botanical Gardens,and Cameroon Environmental Watch (the latter twoare members of civil society) assembled the InteractiveForestry Atlas of Cameroon. The decision-support toolis a compact disc (CD) atlas that compiles and inte-grates GIS/RS data useful to forest monitoring. Key data sets presented in the atlas include roads, hydro- logical networks, logging concessions, vegetation, for-est management unit statistics, and forested areas.Forested areas include boundaries of (i) state forests(protected areas such as game reserves, hunting areas,game ranches, wildlife sanctuaries, and buffer zones, aswell as zoological gardens belonging to the state); (ii)forest reserves (ecological reserves and forests allocated for production and research, as well as botanical gar-dens, plant life sanctuaries, and forest plantations); (iii) council forests; (iii) communal forests; (iv) community forests; and (v) private forests. The CD tool has been widely distributed and used. Because it presents the data in graphic, user-friendlyformats, the tool has been used in various ways includ- ing in prioritizing forest monitoring and enforcementof forest laws, and monitoring compliance by deter-mining whether road construction is taking placewithin the boundaries of legally attributed loggingareas and in compliance with approved manage-ment plans. MINEF and private companies use the tool to support land-use planning, assess impacts from forestry operations, and (because maps areunequivocal) inform dialogue and negotiation in con-flict resolution. The Interactive Forestry Map is currently being updated; a new version is expected to be released in thenear future.Box 7.16 Forest Monitoring in Cameroon Source: Noguer\u00f3n and Stolle 2007. In a 2004 forest sector paper, the Center for Interna- tional Forestry Research (CIFOR) identified the lack ofreliable and timely information on forests as the fore- most origin of poor public and private forest policies. The Ministry of Forestry of Indonesia (MoF) also rec-ognized this lack of information as a major obstacle forsound decision making and development of appropri-ate policies; this recognition has paved the way toward better forest governance in Indonesia. In 2005, the MoF established a National Forest Sec- tor Monitoring and Assessment Process (FOMAS). Theoverall goal of FOMAS is to promote good forest gov-ernance to ensure the optimal contribution of forestresources to poverty reduction, economic growth, and sustainable forest management and conservation. T o achieve this goal, FOMAS will enable transparency andaccountability, which are the essential foundations foreffective forest governance. The specific objective ofFOMAS is to establish the conditions for transparencyin the forest sector bymaking relevant, reliable, accurate, and up-to-date forest sector information available to decision mak-ers inside the MoF on a continuous basis, as well as making key information accessible to the public; and supporting better decision and policy making based on this information. A first and necessary step is to provide support and inform forest management decisions with updated and reliable maps of forest use and forest cover. FOMAS isusing mapping technology as a tool within a compre-hensive decision-making and policy reform approach. Thus, FOMAS will help the MoF in better carrying outits mandate of regulating and managing forest use andestablishing an appropriate framework for a profitableforest sector in Indonesia that is socially and environ-mentally sustainable.Box 7.17 Forest Monitoring in Indonesia Source: Noguer\u00f3n and Stolle 2007. Availability of reference data. Monitoring is effective when reference data (for example, type of forest, bound- ary of parks, roads, or populations) are available. The use of reference data facilitates monitoring and thus deci- sion-making and enforcement processes. However, refer-ence data often do not exist or are of insufficient quality. Human capital. Satellite imagery processing and inter- pretation can be time consuming and often requires an initial investment to set up the processing system. Costs. Costs depend on the satellite used and the accuracy needed. High-resolution imagery remains costly. Spatialaccuracy and ground verification, at least in the initial stages to calibrate imagery interpretation, can add signif- icant expenses. Limited information. Not everything can be detected with RS. Tree species cannot be determined unless data is col- lected at a very detailed scale. Spatial monitoring with RS/GIS can add to, and should not compete with, a detailed ground inventory. OPERATIONAL ASPECTS RS/GIS requirements. Forest monitoring using RS/GIS requires the following: T echnological capability to generate, store, and update the RS/GIS data; this often requires high computer capa-bilities and specialized software for imagery and GIS analysis, interpretation, and manipulation. Human capital to generate, manipulate, apply, and inter- pret the data, as well as capability to translate data inuser-friendly format to end users. Effective and functional forest monitoring. Effective and functional forest monitoring involves the following: An initial assessment of existing information and identi-fication of data gaps to reconcile data with features ofinterest: Forest change in a national park cannot be mon- itored if there is no information on the boundaries of the park. This assessment includes an evaluation of the qual-ity and accuracy of the data: Extraction of a valuablespecies cannot be effectively monitored if the forest com-position data is inaccurate or outdated. Filling out data gaps by creating the data needed (that is, digitizing features from satellite imagery; purchasingsatellite imagery) or identifying and defining surrogate indicators to assess features data (for example, using incidence of fire as an indicator of human activities incertain forest types). Establishing a baseline of (i) the spatial distribution of features of interest that are susceptible to change and (ii)the boundaries against which change will be periodically assessed. 276 CHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENTGeospatial tools can help shape LULUCF projects during the conceptual stages, and beyond, in the following ways: The tools can be used in demonstrating and justify- ing the status of the land use before 31 December 1989 (deadline for the first LULUCF commitment period).Imagery will provide information on current land cover,and if past imagery is available then information aboutthe past land cover can be derived. Land cover maps can then be drawn from these. Where digital information isnot available (for example, when using only old aerialphotographs), an old map can be digitized. They can assess the changes taking place in forest canopy over time. Such change could be a result of for-est restoration activity or tree removals (by logging, fires, disease, and the like). They can demarcate and survey carbon asset boundaries in a project area. Such information, includ-ing land ownership, soil typology, drainage, elevation, and vegetation cover percentage, can then be storedand managed in a GIS. Because GPSs are affordable and portable in the field, they can work in very remote areas and in difficult terrain. Locations can be georeferenced ( xand ycoordinates of the latitude and longitude), and coordinates can bedirectly stored in a computer system. Advancements in the technology now make it pos- sible to integrate geospatial information into a deci- sion-making tool. For instance, remotely sensed datafrom an IKONOS spectral image can be analyzedthrough a GIS platform into different layers as needed.Such layers could include vegetation type, land with or without tree cover, water bodies, ownership patterns, roads, and so forth. This information then becomes aproduct that can help inform decision making.Box 7.18 Using Geospatial T ools for LULUCF Projects Source: Kaguamba 2004. Information obtained through RS sources can be less detailed than intensive fieldwork; ground verification isusually needed to verify and calibrate the RS data. A combination of RS data and field work will produce the most accurate information. Conducting periodic assessments of the features of inter- est or surrogate indicators. Periodicity depends on thecharacteristics being monitored. Compliance with forestry law may only need yearly assessments of the extent and location of logging activity, while incidence offires may need weekly or monthly monitoring. Effective venues to channel the information to end users in easy, user-friendly formats such as Web sites, papermaps, posters, or CDs. Critical information should be channeled in a speedy manner to allow rapid response and action. In many situations, one or several of these ingredients exist. Many countries have some type of periodic assess- ment, or produce maps of reference data (boundaries ofnational parks, for instance). However, monitoring requiresa well-thought-out, systematic approach to integrate allingredients together in a methodic way. For example, between1980 and 2000, four maps of forest resources in Indonesiawere produced (1988, 1993, 1996, and 2000); however, theydo not use consistent legends, units, scales, and time frames, and thus cannot be used effectively for monitoring. Selecting the monitoring approach. There are many different applications of forest monitoring and an equally large number of approaches by which it can be done. For example, for measuring forest disturbance (selective log-ging, for example) and deforestation some methods arehighly manual and others are highly automated. Somemethods work at moderate resolution over large regions of forests. Many tools were designed using dated ideas, tech-nologies, and methods. Selecting the appropriate approach requires that the goals of the monitoring exercise be clearly articulated (seebox 7.19). Factors to consider include the size of area to monitor, the level of detail required, budget constraints, andseason of the year (because of cloud cover). 2 NOTE 7.3: SPATIAL MONITORING OF FORESTS 277If the goal is to develop a country-scale monitoring program for deforestation, defined as clear-cuts of 20hectares and larger, the rate-limiting step is not analyt- ical methodology or data availability. T erra-MODIS satellite imagery is free and can perform the function,and the methods are simple and automated. The limi-tation is in training, exercise, and operational demon-stration of the capability. If the goal is to develop a country-scale monitoring program for deforestation with clear-cuts of one hectare and above plus selective logging, the rate-limiting stepsare in both the analytical techniques and satellite dataavailability. With the loss of Landsat 7, the availabledata are from a 22-year-old Landsat 5 or from more expensive sources such as the French or Indian space agencies. This is workable if, and only if, such channelsremain open. The methods for fine-scale deforestation and log- ging monitoring are highly automated in some pro-grams, such as the one coordinated at the CarnegieInstitution of Washington.a This automated systemcurrently works well but falls short in mountainousterrain and with some of the more noisy high-resolu-tion sensors, and is still being improved for very small-scale disturbances. This automated system is the only one to deliver country-scale deforestation and loggingmaps, such as the first-ever large-scale deforestation plus logging map at sub-30 m resolution (see box fig- ure for the Amazon). The information from this sys-tem can produce both extent and intensity of forestdisturbance, where the latter is defined as the percent-age of canopy opening and surface debris generation. Remote monitoring of forest damage levels is nowstraightforward, if the challenges presented by cloudsand terrain are resolved. Other groups mostly use manual techniques, result- ing in long delivery times. Most methods produce for-est and nonforest classes in their products. A few pro- duce more information, such as fractional cover of the canopy. In the figure below, showing land cover change in the Amazon, the medium gray is what the other \"state-of-the-art\" technology shows as deforestation (forestcover change). The dark gray shows what the auto-mated system reveals\u2014selective logging completelymissed by other widely used RS systems. The dark graycurrently shows a preview of what will be medium grayin two to four years.Box 7.19 Selecting the Appropriate Approach and T ools (Box continues on the following page. )Spatial and temporal scale. Forest monitoring using RS/GIS can be carried out on different spatial and temporal scales depending on the features of interest for monitoring and the goal of the monitoring exercise. Forest monitoring using RS/GIS can include clear cuts, intensive selective log-ging, log yards, fires, road building, habitat fragmentation,biomass, and productivity. The monitoring of these featuresoften requires different time steps and detail. A national overview of deforestation usually requires a one to five yeartime frame, while monitoring of fires in national parks mayneed more frequent updates (several satellites can detectfires in the forests, see box 7.20). Forest monitoring methods. A number of different applications and methods for forest monitoring exist, and the choice of which to use will depend on the purpose of themonitoring and the desired spatial and temporal scales.Table 7.4 lists the existing satellite remote sensors, and their applications and limitations for specific purposes. Table 7.5lists currently available global forest maps. An emerging RS/GIS application that merits special con- sideration is the MODIS-derived data set of percentage of tree coverage, produced by researchers at the University ofMaryland and South Dakota State University. The new maps,based on the MODIS sensor operated by NASA, provide a consistent overview of the global distribution of percentageof tree coverage in a continuous gradient (0 to 100 percent).This allows flexibility so that the gradient can be adapted todifferent forest definitions. The MODIS satellite provides freeglobal data coverage daily, allowing information to be com- piled and processed in a relatively speedy manner. The speed of data availability, the relative low cost, and the flexibility toadapt to different forest definitions offer huge opportunitiesfor international and global forest monitoring efforts. 278 CHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENT Box 7.19 Selecting the Appropriate Approach and T ools (continued) Source: Asner and others 2006 (copyright 2006 National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A.). Note: This program is coordinated by Gregory P . Asner, Department of Global Ecology, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Stanford, CA, USA. This program required about US$2.5 million to develop the areas of signal processing, super-computing, canopy physics, and field ecology necessary to make such monitoring feasible.Deforestation (1997-2000) Selective logging (1999-2000)Parameters affecting cost and quality. Several remote sensing technology parameters determine the quality of results as well as the costs. They include, but are not limited to scale, resolution, and color (panchromatic or multispec- tral) and whether a GIS component is to be added. Ground-truthing of some features and aspects\u2014legality of identifiedlogging, taxonomic identification of some species, determi-nation of \"forest\" status (where it is not easy to differentiate, for example, between a dense shrub thicket and a degradedpoor quality forest)\u2014will inevitably remain necessary.However, the cost of ground-truthing will be kept lowbecause it will be done selectively. Depending on the objective, stratification approaches can assist in reducing costs. A gross assessment can provideguidance on which relevant locations require a moredetailed assessment, providing guidance for stratifying thesample. Detailed mapping of more specific sites can reduceoverall cost without compromising accuracy. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS A well-thought-through monitoring plan with a choice ofthe best combination of RS technologies (satellite, aircraft, ground GPS, GIS), with pockets of ground-truthing, and aresultant acceptable cost structure, should start operatingfrom project identification, es pecially for projects such as LULUCF projects. A cost-saving approach should be adopted for small- scale projects, or for projects involving many but small com-munity afforestation or reforestation projects. Such anapproach would use a centralized RS data acquisition andprocessing provider for the monitoring requirements. An effective forest monitoring system using RS/GIS should be technically sound, but it should also have socialbuy-in. T echnological advances in the RS/GIS field are notenough for effective forest monitoring; monitoring has tobe driven by societal and political demands. Forest moni-toring systems have to be collaborative and they have to be developed with the information end users want to ensurethat the information meets their needs and is appropriatefor managing resources, policies, and practices. Monitoring systems must be firmly integrated into the decision-making process and must be supported by civil society. Monitoring should go hand-in-hand with trans-parency and better and accurate forestry and reference data. NOTE 7.3: SPATIAL MONITORING OF FORESTS 279Annual, and even quarterly, large-scale assessments are very possible using satellite data, if the imagery is beingcollected. However, there is no guarantee that the nec- essary imagery is being collected. The spatial resolution of MODIS is not high enough to be of real value\u2014toomuch forest area needs to be cleared for it to be recog-nized by the free MODIS data. Landsat-like sensors, orbetter, are needed. Next-generation techniques and technologies are being developed. Weekly or monthly assessments require a very spe- cialized satellite capability (Quickbird imagery) or air-craft. Both are viable options with different budgetaryimplications: Quickbird satellite data are for smaller areas of for- est (<10,000 ha) and expensive, and the imagesyield basic information, such as forest cover. Airborne platforms are extremely data rich (provid-ing forest cover, detailed structure, diversity to somedegree, and so forth), can cover large areas (up to 250,000 ha per day), and are cheap in comparisonwith launching a satellite. In general, satellites with a high temporal resolution (for example, daily over-pass) have low spatial resolu- tion (250-1,000 meters), and satellites with higher spa-tial resolution (30 meters) have low temporal resolu-tion (20-30 days over-pass). Thus, from the beginningthe user has to choose between satellites with an overview scale (1 km to 250 meter spatial resolution), which provide a wide view(often 1,000 km) and high frequency (once or twice a day) (available from MODIS or NOAA); or more detailed data (5-50 meter spatial resolution) with a much narrower view (50-100 km) but lessfrequency (20-40 days) (for example, TM, SPOT, ASTER).Box 7.20 Using Remote Sensing for Real-Time Monitoring Source: Erick C.

CROSS-REFERENCED CHAPTERS AND NOTES Note 7.2: Forest Management Information Systems 282 CHAPTER 7: MONITORING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENTBackground. A national system for forest monitoring and information will enable a decision-making environment where reliable, accurate, and current information on forest and timber resources and related decisions are continuously and publicly available, and where authorities can takeactions upon this information to combat illegal logging andstrengthen law enforcement. Specific objectives. The specific objective of a national system for forest monitoring and information is to establish the conditions for transparency in the forest sector by making relevant, reliable, accurate, and up-to-date forest sector information continuously available to decisionmakers as well as making key information publicly acces- sible; and assisting decision makers in better decision and policy making based on daily use of better-managed information. There are several steps to consider before such an activ- ity can proceed. These include the following: Create and mobilize political support to generate continued incentives for action and establish a culture of trans-parency. This may involve stakeholder consultations to build a constituency and attain official recognition. Make use of the best available forest monitoring and com-munication technologies and existing capacity in forestresearch and related technical fields in nongovernment sec- tors to increase effectiveness and reduce cost. To do t h i s effectively, it would be important to collect and compile existing forest-related data into a GIS database, to assessthe availability and quality of forest data, and to identifydata gaps. This should include a review of the newremote sensing-based forest cover change mappingapproaches being developed by a number of organiza-tions. With this information, a needs assessment can becarried out. Focus on improving high-impact forest sector decision making to address the most critical issues and ensure continued momentum for action. This will require priori- tizing information and decision support activities that are (i) most important for enabling policy change and(ii) most likely to rapidly result in successful outcomes. Enable public scrutiny and promote clean government. This will require (i) developing a clear information dis-closure policy and operational information disclosure mechanism to ensure public access to relevant informa- tion, (ii) training civil society to use this information,and (iii) gathering NGO and industry feedback toimprove the policy. Upon completion of these steps, the terms of reference for this activity can use elements of the sample TOR for FMIS (see Annex 7.2A to note 7.2, Forest ManagementInformation Systems). NOTE 7.3: SPATIAL MONITORING OF FORESTS 283ANNEX 7.3A ELEMENTS FOR TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR DEVELOPING A NATIONAL SYSTEM FOR FOREST MONITORING AND INFORMATION Guidance on Implementing Forests Policy OP 4.36PART IIThe World Bank has 10 key policies that are critical to ensuring that potentially adverse environmentaland social consequences are identified, minimized, and mitigated, as well as a policy on disclosure. In the con- text of forests, the Operational Policy on Forests (OP 4.36)is proactive in both identifying and protecting critical forest conservation areas and in supporting improved forest man-agement in production forests outside these areas. The reader should note that this section covers only the policies relevant to World Bank investment projects. The World Bank also has an Operational Policy on DevelopmentPolicy Lending (OP 8.60) that is relevant to the forest sectorand Forests Strategy. Section 11 of OP 8.60 states: The World Bank determines whether specific countrypolicies supported by the operation are likely to causesignificant effects on the country's environment,forests, and other natural resources. For country poli-cies with likely significant effects, the World Bankassesses in the Program Document the borrower's sys-tems for reducing such adverse effects and enhancingpositive effects, drawing on relevant country-level orsectoral environmental analysis. If there are signifi-cant gaps in the analysis or shortcomings in the bor-rower's systems, the World Bank describes in the Pro- gram Document how such gaps or shortcomingswould be addressed before or during program imple-mentation, as appropriate.Guidance on handling the due diligence requirement in OP 8.60 with regard to forests is discussed in chapter 6 of the Forests Sourcebook, and its associated notes. HISTORY OF THE WORLD BANK'S FORESTS POLICIES The World Bank's original Operational Directive on Forestry (OD 4.36) was issued in 1993. It grew out of a con- cern (voiced by environmental nongovernmental organiza- tions [NGOs] and other outside stakeholders, as well as within the World Bank) that World Bank-supportedforestry operations need to be environmentally sustainable.As such, the policy was focused primarily on forestry activ-ities. This Forestry Policy was controversial, both within and outside the World Bank, because it prohibited World Bankfinancing of commercial logging in primary tropical moistforests. This provision did not prohibit technical assistanceand numerous indirect forms of support for such logging.Nonetheless, it had a chilling effect upon World Bank man- agement and project staff, who were reluctant to support activities that were in any way linked to any kind of tropicalforest harvesting, even when the expected outcomes wouldbe highly positive from a conservation standpoint. Mean-while, deforestation (driven more by agricultural expansionthan by logging) was continuing and even increasing inmany World Bank member countries, resulting in the con-cern that the World Bank's relative disengagement from 287 Introduction to the World Bank Forests PolicyCHAPTER 8forestry activities was counterproductive, from a poverty reduction as well as from a conservation perspective. T o promote a more proactive World Bank role in forest management and conservation activities in developing coun- tries, the Board in 2002 approved a new Forests Policy (OP4.36) and a revised Forests Strategy, following a long and exten-sive consultation process with numerous stakeholders, includ-ing environmental NGOs. The new OP 4.36 differs from the previous Policy on Forests in several key respects, including (i)a focus on all types of World Bank-supported investmentoperations that involve forests, not just forestry; (ii) emphasison all types of forests in developing countries (including tem-perate and boreal forests), rather than principally tropical forests; and (iii) permitting World Bank support for commer- cial harvesting within tropical or other forests, provided thatthe forests in question are not critical forests (or related criticalnatural habitats) and the harvesting is carried out according tospecific high standards, normally including independent certi-fication (see below for further details). The new OP 4.36 hasbeen rewritten to ensure consistency with the Natural HabitatsOP 4.04, although the Forests Policy is more detailed withrespect to forestry activities. The following are three safeguard policies that apply to almost every World Bank-financed investment project 1 involving forests: Environmental Assessment. The World Bank's Environ- mental Assessment Policy (OP/BP 4.01)2governs the envi- ronmental assessment process that all World Bank-supported projects\u2014that is, all investment operations, including those of the World Bank's debt financing (IBRD) and concessional financing (IDA) arms, as well as those involving the GlobalEnvironment Facility (GEF)\u2014must follow. Most projectsinvolving forests are classified as either Category A (requir-ing a full environmental impact assessment, EIA) or B (requiring an environmental analysis that is usually morelimited in scope than a full EIA), according to criteria thatare discussed further below. Forests. The Forests Policy (OP/BP 4.36) covers all projects that affect natural or planted forests, whether positively or negatively (see chapter 9, Applying Forests Policy OP 4.36). Natural Habitats. The Natural Habitats Policy (OP/BP 4.04) covers projects that affect natural forests or other non- forest natural ecosystems, with special focus on those proj-ects that might lead to significant loss or degradation of nat-ural habitats (details below). SCOPE OF THE FORESTS AND NATURAL HABITATS POLICIES Because the Forests Policy was rewritten in 2002 in a man- ner that would ensure consistency with the Natural HabitatsPolicy, these two safeguard policies overlap extensively in (i) the types of ecosystems they cover, (ii) the types of projects that are subject to their requirements, and (iii) the mainrequirements that relevant projects need to follow. Types of ecosystems or land-use systems. Forests OP 4.36 applies to projects involving all types of natural (pri- mary and secondary) forests (defined in OP 4.36, annex A,to include a rather broad range of wooded ecosystems), aswell as forest plantations. Natural Habitats OP 4.04 appliesto projects involving all types of natural ecosystems, includ-ing natural forests as well as the full range of nonforest nat-ural ecosystems (terrestrial, freshwater, and marine). Thus,both of these safeguard policies apply to projects that some-how involve natural forests (broadly defined). However,only the Forests Policy would apply to projects with non -native plantation forests, if these are planted on land thatdoes not (and did not recently) contain natural habitats.Conversely, only the Natural Habitats Policy would apply toprojects affecting exclusively nonforest natural habitats(such as natural grasslands, freshwater lakes, beaches, orcoral reefs). Types of projects. The new Forests OP 4.36 covers all forestry projects, as well as a broad range of other projects that may affect (positively or negatively, directly or indi-rectly) the health and quality of forests of any type. Theseprojects can include, among others, investments in (i)transportation (highways, rural roads, large bridges, rail-ways, airports, ports, river navigation works); (ii) electricpower (hydroelectric dams, power transmission lines, windfarms on forested ridges, thermal power plants emitting airpollution harmful to forests); (iii) industry (mining, oiland gas, manufacturing industries requiring fuelwood);(iv) agriculture (crop cultivation, agroforestry, cattle andother livestock, fisheries involving mangrove or otherforests, land administration and land reform involvingforested areas); (v) water supply (reservoirs, canals,abstraction of ground or surface water affecting forests);(vi) urban development involving wooded areas; (vii)tourism (resort development, ecotourism in forestedareas); (viii) telecommunications (transmission towers andaccess roads on mountaintops or other forested areas); (ix)privatization of state-owned forested lands; and (x) natural 288 CHAPTER 8: INTRODUCTION TO THE WORLD BANK FORESTS POLICYresource management and conservation, including all types of forestry, protected areas, and similar investments. TheNatural Habitats OP 4.04 applies as well to all these types of investments, as long as they involve natural forests or other kinds of natural habitats. As a practical, quick summary, the largely overlapping safeguards requirements of the Forests and Natural Habitatspolicies can be summarized as follows: If a nonforestry project complies with OP 4.04, it also automatically complies with OP 4.36. If a nonforestry project complies with OP 4.36, it alsocomplies with OP 4.04, except where nonforest naturalhabitats are involved (in which case OP 4.04 needs to be specifically applied). All forestry projects (involving natural forests as well as plantations) are subject to the additional requirements inOP 4.36. OTHER RELEVANT SAFEGUARD POLICIES The remaining eight safeguard policies can sometimes applyto projects involving forests (for more information on eachof these policies, please refer to the World Bank Safeguards Web site): Indigenous Peoples. The Indigenous Peoples Policy (OP/BP 4.10) specifies how Indigenous Peoples need to be consulted and involved in the design of projects that may affect them (positively or negatively). Many projects involv-ing forests also involve Indigenous Peoples, who are impor-tant stakeholders in forest-based activities. Key require-ments of OP 4.10 are social assessment; free, prior, andinformed consultations leading to broad community sup- port to the project; and development and disclosure of an Indigenous Peoples Plan or Planning Framework (see chap-ter 12, Applying OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples). Involuntary Resettlement. The Involuntary Resettle- ment Policy (OP/BP 4.12) applies to projects involving either (i) the involuntary taking of (forested or any other) land forproject purposes that leads to physical relocation, loss ofassets, or loss of income sources or livelihoods for theaffected persons; or (ii) the involuntary restriction of accessto legally designated protected areas that leads to adverseimpacts on the livelihoods of the affected persons. T o address these impacts, the policy requires the preparation of (i)either a Resettlement Plan or Resettlement Policy Frame-work in the case of involuntary land taking; and (ii) a Process Framework in the case of involuntary restriction of access tothe natural resources within parks and protected areas. Thepolicy does not cover restrictions of access to naturalresources outside of formal protected areas, such as commu-nity-based natural resource management projects (OP 4.12,footnote 6), or the regulation of forests or other naturalresources at a national or regional level (OP 4.12, footnote8). (See the World Bank's Involuntary Resettlement Source-book, and for more details on the preparation of a ProcessFramework, see also \"Guidance on Development of T erms ofReference Related T o OP 4.36\" in chapter 9.) Pest Management. The Pest Management Policy (OP 4.09 and BP 4.01, annex C) applies to projects that (i) involve (through World Bank or counterpart funds) the procure-ment of pesticides or pesticide application equipment;(ii) would lead to substantially increased pesticide use; or(iii) would maintain or expand pest management practicesthat are unsustainable or risky from an environmental or health standpoint. Some forestry projects involve significantpest management issues (sometimes including pesticideuse) in natural or plantation forests as well as in tree nurs-eries (for guidance on applying this OP , please refer to the Pest Management Guidebook). Physical Cultural Resources. The Physical Cultural Resources Policy (OP/BP 4.11) was issued in April 2006, replacing the substantially similar Management of Cultural Property in World Bank-Financed Projects OPN 11.03. Thispolicy applies to projects that might affect sites and objectsof archaeological, paleontological, historical, architectural,religious, aesthetic, or other cultural significance. Projectsinvolving forests that might also trigger this policy include, among others, those with (i) civil works (including forestry roads, small buildings, and manual tree planting) that mightuncover previously unknown relics; and (ii) forested sites ofspecial cultural significance (including sacred forests identi-fied by local communities). Projects in Disputed Areas. This policy (OP 7.60) pre- scribes special consultation and due diligence procedures for any projects proposed in geographic areas that are dis-puted between two or more countries. Many such areas areremote and forested. Projects on International Waterways. This policy (OP 7.50) covers projects that could appreciably affect international CHAPTER 8: INTRODUCTION TO THE WORLD BANK FORESTS POLICY 289waterways, or the quantity or quality of water in more than one country. Some of these projects could also affect forests (suchas through inundation by a reservoir or the loss of available water to riparian forests from upstream abstraction). Safety of Dams. This policy (OP 4.37) applies to projects that construct, rehabilitate, or substantially depend upon large or high-hazard dams, whether these dams are for hydropower, water supply, or other functions (includingmine tailings containment). Some projects involving damsalso affect forests\u2014whether through permanent flooding,water diversion, induced land-use changes, or otherimpacts. (For guidance on applying this OP , please refer to the Regulatory Framework for Dam Safety.) This section of the sourcebook has four chapters follow- ing this introduction. Chapter 9 is on applying OP 4.36. Chapter 9 also includes a discussion of the main require-ments of the Forests Policy, guidelines for implementation(including preparation requirements, appraisal require-ments, and supervision requirements), definitions, andguidance on identifying critical forests and critical naturalhabitats through environmental assessment, which includesa discussion on protecting forests through conservation off- sets. Chapter 10 is on consultation and communication inforest projects. Chapter 11 discusses the Forest Certification Assessment Guide. The Indigenous Peoples policy is covered in chapter 12. NOTES 1. This may include technical assistance and grants, such as the GEF. T echnical assistance that affects forests can be cov- ered by safeguards. Development policy loans are not covered by safeguards. Development policy loans are subject to OP 8.60, which is discussed in chapter 6 and associated notes. 2. OP means an Operational Policy, which is approved by the Board and regarded as a requirement for projects to fol-low. BP means a World Bank Procedure, which is approved by Bank management. When used in this sourcebook, OPoften refers as well to the accompanying BP for that safe-guard policy. REFERENCE CITED World Bank. \"Pest Management Guidebook.\" Available at http://go.worldbank.org/RJPAKAND00. 290 CHAPTER 8: INTRODUCTION TO THE WORLD BANK FORESTS POLICYOperational Policy (OP) 4.36 applies to all World Bank investment operations that potentially havean impact on forests, regardless of whether they are specific forest sector investments. It also encourages the incorporation of forest issues in Country Assistance Strate-gies (CASs), and addresses cross-sectoral impacts on forests.The policy provides for conservation of critical naturalhabitats and prohibits World Bank financing of any com- mercial harvesting or plantation development in criticalnatural habitats. It also allows for proactive investment sup-port to improve forest management outside critical forestareas, with explicit safeguards to ensure that such WorldBank-financed operations comply with independent certifi- cation standards acceptable to the World Bank, or opera- tions with an agreed upon, time-bound action plan toestablish compliance with these standards. OBJECTIVE OF THE FORESTS POLICY The objective of OP 4.36 is to assist clients to harness the potential of forests to reduce poverty in a sustainable man-ner, to effectively integrate forests into sustainable economic development, and to protect the vital local and global envi- ronmental services and values of forests. Where forestrestoration and plantation development are necessary tomeet these objectives, the World Bank assists clients withforest restoration activities that maintain or enhance biodi- versity and ecosystem functionality. The World Bank assistsclients with the establishment of environmentally appropri-ate, socially beneficial, and economically viable forest plan-tations to help meet growing demands for forest goods andservices. Specifically The World Bank uses environmental assessments, poverty assessments, social analyses, public expenditurereviews, and other economic and sector work to identify the economic, environmental, and social significance of forests in borrowing countries. The World Bank integrates strategies into its CASs to address any potential significant impacts of the CAS onforests. The World Bank does notfinance projects that would involve significant conversion or degradation of criticalforest areas or other natural habitats. The World Bank does notfinance projects that contra- vene applicable international environmental laws. The World Bank does notfinance plantations that involve any conversion or degradation of critical natural habitats,including adjacent or downstream critical natural habitats. The World Bank only finances commercial harvesting operations or the purchase of logging equipment in areasthat it has determined are not critical forests or related critical natural habitats. The World Bank only finances industrial-scale commer- cial harvesting operations in areas outside critical forest areas, where such operations are either certified as meet- ing standards of responsible forest management under 291 Applying Forests Policy OP 4.36CHAPTER 9an independent forest certification system acceptable to the World Bank, or adhere to a time-bound, phasedaction plan acceptable to the World Bank for achieving certification to such standards. In areas outside of critical forest areas, the World Bank may finance harvesting operations by small-scale land-holders, local communities under community forest management, or entities under joint forest management. Such financing can be provided where these operationshave either achieved a standard of forest managementdeveloped with the meaningful participation of affectedlocal communities that is consistent with the principles and criteria of responsible forest management outlinedin paragraph 10 of OP 4.36, or adhere to a time-boundaction plan to achieve such a standard that has beendeveloped with the meaningful participation of affectedlocal communities and acceptable to the World Bank. All such operations must be monitored by the client, with the meaningful participation of local people who are affected. The World Bank uses environmental assessment to address the impact of all World Bank-financed invest-ment projects on forests and the rights and welfare of local communities. The World Bank ensures that World Bank-financed investment projects involving the management of forestsincorporate measures to strengthen the fiscal, legal, and institutional framework in the borrowing country to meet defined economic, environmental, and socialobjectives that address, among other issues, the respec-tive roles and legal rights of the government, the privatesector, and local people. The World Bank ensures that World Bank-financed investment projects involving the management of forestsgive preference to small-scale, community-level manage- ment approaches where they best harness the potential to reduce poverty in a sustainable manner. The World Bank ensures that the design of World Bank-financed investment projects that use forestresources evaluate the prospects for the development of new markets and marketing arrangements for nontim- ber forest products and related goods and services, takinginto account the full range of goods and environmentalservices derived from well-managed forests. Triggers. The policy is triggered whenever any World Bank-financed investment project (i) has the potential to have impacts on the health and quality of forests or therights and welfare of people and their level of dependenceupon or interaction with forests or (ii) aims to bring aboutchanges in the management, protection, or utilization of natural forests or plantations. Mechanisms for achieving policy objectives. As noted above, the World Bank's objectives in forests are to assist clients to harness the potential of forests to reduce poverty,integrate forests into sustainable economic development,and protect vital local or global environmental services andvalues of forests. Mechanisms to achieve these objectives aredescribed in the OP , and the World Bank procedures docu-ment, and include use of appropriate economic, environmental, and social assessments to identify the economic and environmentalsignificance of forests and any activities involved in the World Bank-financed investment that may adversely affect the well-being of forests and the people whodepend on them; assessment of the potential for activities proposed in a CAS that would significantly impact forests, and incor-poration of strategies to address these impacts; use of information required from the client on policy,legal, and institutional frameworks in sector or projectdesign to address priority poverty, social, and environ- mental issues needed to meet the economic, environ- mental, and social objectives of World Bank-financedinvestment projects; use in project design of assessments of the adequacy of land-use allocations for the management, conservation,and sustainable development of forests, including identi- fication of any additional allocations needed to protect critical forest areas; use of clear standards of forest management certification to guide any investment support for harvesting opera-tions, including time-bound action plans to achieve cer- tification of acceptable standards of forest management; and use of market assessments to determine the full range of goods and services available from well-managed foreststo enhance returns from forest management and give preference to small-scale, community-level management approaches where they best harness the potential offorests to reduce poverty in a sustainable manner. Consultation and disclosure requirements (World Bank Policy on Disclosure of Information). The World Bank requires clients to identify and consult the groups inforest areas likely to be affected by World Bank-financedinvestment projects in and beyond the forest sector. 292 CHAPTER 9: APPLYING FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36The disclosure requirements set out in the Environmen- tal Assessment (EA) Policy (OP 4.01) apply to all projects affecting forests. Aside from the required EA documentation, there is no freestanding document that is automatically required for all projects affecting forests. However, many for-est-related projects will generate freestanding reports (suchas Forest Management Plans), which should be made pub-licly available as a matter of good practice. Experience has shown that transparent decision-making processes areimportant for good forest governance and good developmentoutcomes, and full disclosure of forest-related informationshould be encouraged wherever feasible. Additional require-ments for consultations apply if the World Bank's Indige- nous Peoples' or Involuntary Resettlement policies apply. MAIN REQUIREMENTS OF THE FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36 requires that all relevant types of projects must ensure that they avoid causing significant, unmitigatedharm to natural forests or other natural habitats. These \"do no harm\" requirements can be summarized as follows (see the text of each policy for the full details): Avoiding significant damage to critical forests and other critical natural habitats. OP 4.36, paragraph 5 prohibits World Bank support for projects that wouldinvolve the significant conversion or degradation of critical forests or other types of critical natural habitats (see the def- initions section that follows). Minimizing and mitigating damage to other (non- critical) forests and other natural habitats. For proposed projects that would adversely affect noncritical forests and other natural habitats, the World Bank's ForestsPolicy has more flexible (but nonetheless rigorous) stan-dards of compliance. Where feasible, the conversion (loss)or degradation of any forests and other natural habitatsshould be avoided through careful project siting and design.There is a strong presumption against any significant con-version or degradation of noncritical natural forests. How-ever, the World Bank may still support a project that wouldlead to significant conversion or degradation of noncriticalforests or other noncritical natural habitats if (i) there are no feasible alternatives for achieving a project's key objec-tives; (ii) comprehensive analysis demonstrates that theoverall benefits from the project substantially outweigh theenvironmental costs; and (iii) the project includes mitiga-tion measures acceptable to the World Bank. These mitiga-tion measures must be technically justified and shouldinclude, where appropriate, the establishment or strength- ening of ecologically similar protected areas (see OP 4.04,paragraph 5; OP 4.04, annex A, item [e]; and OP 4.36, para-graph 5 for the full legal language). Forest plantations. With respect to forest plantations, OP 4.36 (paragraph 7) specifies the following: The World Bank does not finance forest plantations that involve any conversion or degradation (whether \"signifi- cant\" or not) of critical natural habitats. Such conversion would typically take place when a native forest or natural grassland is replaced as part of plantation establishment.Under OP 4.36, all World Bank-supported forestry plan-tations must be sited away from critical natural habitats. In the case of noncritical natural habitats, the World Bank gives preference (as with other types of projects) to sitingforest plantations on lands that no longer contain natural habitats, provided that these lands were not converted in anticipation of the World Bank-supported project. World Bank-supported forest plantation projects need to prevent and mitigate threats to natural habitats andbiodiversity, including the potential spread of invasive species (such as the Pinus species in the natural grass- lands of southern South America). Harvesting of natural forests. With respect to the har- vesting of natural forests, the Forests Policy: Prohibits World Bank financing for commercial or community-based harvesting in any areas containingcritical forests or related critical natural habitats (OP 4.36, paragraph 8), with the exception that community- based harvesting (defined in OP 4.36, annex A, items [d]and [e]) may take place within multiple-use ManagedResource Protected Areas (Category VI in the standard-ized World Conservation Union [IUCN] international classification scheme for different types of protectedareas), where such harvesting is an integral part of themanagement plan for the area. Requires that industrial-scale commercial forest harvest- ing can receive World Bank financing only if it is either(i) certified under an independent forest certification system acceptable to the World Bank as meeting stan- dards of good forest management or (ii) adhering to atime-bound action plan acceptable to the World Bank forachieving certification of such standards. (These stan-dards of good forest management are specified in OP 4.36, paragraphs 10-11.) CHAPTER 9: APPLYING FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36 293In the case of forest harvesting by small-scale landholders or local communities (by themselves or under joint forestmanagement arrangements), formal certification is not required for World Bank financing. However, these produc- ers, who are generally small scale, must either (i) achievestandards of forest management consistent with the criteriaoutlined in OP 4.36, paragraph 10; or (ii) adhere to a time-bound action plan (developed with the meaningful partici- pation of affected local communities and acceptable to theWorld Bank) to achieve these standards. Small-scale landholders and local communities.The forests policy does not require formal certification ofthe forest management practices of small-scale landholdersand local communities, largely because of the typically hightransaction costs for these small-scale producers to obtainsuch certification. WHEN IS THE FORESTS POLICY TRIGGERED? Strictly speaking, both policies (OP 4.36 and Natural Habi- tats OP 4.04) apply to any projects that affect forests orother natural habitats, whether positively or negatively. As explicitly stated in OP 4.36 (paragraph 3), the Forests Policy applies to all investment projects that (i) may have someimpact on the health and quality of forests; (ii) may affectthe rights and well-being of forest-dependent people; or(iii) seek to bring about changes in the management, pro- tection, or use of natural forests or plantations. Althoughthe emphasis is on the \"do no harm\" safeguard provisions,OP 4.36 also promotes \"doing good\" by pursuing opportu-nities for the conservation and sustainable use of forests andother natural habitats within World Bank-supported proj- ects, analytical work, and policy dialogue. Within the World Bank, the triggering of a particular safeguard policy is often understood to mean either (i) the need for due diligence to verify whether adverse impacts areexpected, to ensure compliance with the policy's specificrequirements; or (ii) the need for designing and imple-menting specific measures to prevent or mitigate adverseimpacts. Under these rather narrow interpretations, bothOP 4.36 and OP 4.04 would be triggered by those projectsthat have the potential to convert or degrade forests or othernatural habitats, but not by those projects that are strictlyconservation oriented and have no significant adverse envi- ronmental impacts (except that forestry projects always trig-ger OP 4.36). In several World Bank project documents (including the Project Appraisal Document [PAD], Project InformationDocument [PID], and Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet [ISDS]), it is necessary to indicate whether a proposedinvestment project triggers OP 4.36 or OP 4.04. In thisregard, it is recommended as good practice to take a broad (and literal) interpretation of the full text of these policystatements, and thus to indicate that the project does triggerthese policies if it would affect forests or other natural habi-tats in any way, positively or negatively. However, at a mini-mum, it is required to indicate that a project triggers (i) OP 4.36 if it is either a forestry project of any kind, or anonforestry project with the potential for significant loss ordegradation of any natural forests or related natural habitats;and (ii) OP 4.04 if it has the potential for significant loss ordegradation of any natural habitats (including natural forests). For this particular reporting requirement, thepotential to cause significant loss or degradation of forests orother natural habitats should be assessed in the (at least the-oretical) absence of any planned project-specific screeningor other measures that would serve to prevent or mitigate these adverse impacts. ENVIRONMENTAL CLASSIFICATION OF PROJECTS INVOLVING FORESTS Under the EA policy, all World Bank-supported investment projects are classified as Environmental Category A,(requiring a full environmental impact assessment); Cate- gory B (requiring a more limited environmental analysis); Category C (requiring no environmental analysis after theinitial screening); or Category FI (involving on-lendingthrough financial intermediaries). The EnvironmentalAssessment OP 4.01 (paragraph 8) provides the generic cri- teria for environmental classification that should always befollowed. The 1998 Good Practices Note (OP 4.01, annex B)suggests that Category A is normally the best classificationfor \"forestry production projects,\" while Category B is gen-erally most appropriate for watershed management or reha- bilitation, protected areas, and biodiversity conservation. OP 4.36, paragraph 3, specifies that \"a project with thepotential for conversion or degradation of natural forests orother natural habitats that is likely to have significantadverse environmental impacts that are sensitive, diverse, orunprecedented is classified as Category A; projects other-wise involving forests or other natural habitats are classifiedas Category B, C, or FI, depending on the type, location,sensitivity, and scale of the project and the nature and mag-nitude of its environmental impacts.\" The Natural HabitatsPolicy (OP 4.04, paragraph 2) provides a similar (but notquite identical) approach: \"[i]f, as part of the environmen- 294 CHAPTER 9: APPLYING FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36tal assessment process, environmental screening indicates the potential for significant conversion or degradation ofcritical or other natural habitats, the project is classified as Category A; projects otherwise involving natural forests are classified as Category A or B, depending on the degree oftheir ecological impacts.\" Guidelines for the environmental classification of proj- ects that involve forests include the following 1: Category A is the appropriate category for (i) nonforestry projects of any type with the potential to cause (directly or indirectly) the significant conversion or degradation of natural forests or adjacent natural habitats (such as new roads through forests, large dams, mining, oil andgas, large-scale irrigation or new land settlement, otherlarge-scale civil works in forested areas, and industriesdependent upon natural forests for raw materials); (ii) forest plantation projects that would lead to the sig-nificant conversion or degradation of noncritical naturalhabitats; and (iii) commercial forest harvesting that(because of intensive or high-impact management prac-tices) would lead to significant ecological modification (with reduced native species diversity) of natural forests. Category B is the appropriate category for (i) natural for- est management (including forest harvesting) that does not lead to significant ecological modification or degra- dation; (ii) forestry plantations that would not adversely affect natural habitats; (iii) most other types of naturalresource management projects, including watershedmanagement and protected area establishment orstrengthening; and (iv) many types of nonforestry proj- ects with some potential for adverse environmentalimpacts, but no significant loss or degradation of forestsor other natural habitats. Category C is appropriate for some types of conserva- tion-oriented projects with no civil works and no evident adverse environmental impacts, such as (i) environmen- tal service payments to landowners to maintain their existing natural forest cover; or (ii) the establishment ofconservation trust funds for the recurrent costs of pro-tected area management. Category FI is appropriate for certain projects in which financial intermediaries would invest in subprojects, some of which might involve forests. GUIDELINES ON IMPLEMENTING OP 4.36 Preparation requirements. The task team leader and client ensure thatT erms of Reference (TOR) are reviewed and agreed uponfor any social, environmental, and economic assessmentsrequired in OP/BP 4.36 and other relevant World Bank OPs/BPs; economic, environmental, and social analyses are under- taken to identify the economic, environmental, andsocial significance of forests and any activities involved in proposed CASs or World Bank-financed investments that may adversely affect the well-being of forests and thepeople who depend on them; inventories are undertaken at a spatial scale that is eco- logically, socially, and culturally appropriate for the for-est area in which the project or investment program is located to identify critical forest areas and assess the ade- quacy of land allocations to protect these areas; the linkages between any proposed forest sector activities and the poverty reduction, macroeconomic, and conser-vation objectives of the World Bank's country assistance program are clear; there is evaluation of the potential for developing mar- kets for the full range of forest goods and services, givingpreference to small-scale, community-level management approaches that best harness the use of forests for poverty reduction in a sustainable manner; and local people, communities, and the private sector are meaningfully involved in defining activities to be under-taken in the management, conservation, and sustainable utilization of natural forests or plantations. Appraisal requirements. The task team reviews project preparation and any environmental or project management or monitoring plans to ensure that all necessary social, economic, and environmental stud- ies are satisfactorily completed; government commitment is secured for any measuresthat may be required to strengthen the fiscal, legal, andinstitutional frameworks needed to meet the project's economic, environmental, and social objectives; adequate land allocations have been made for the manage- ment, conservation, and sustainable development of forests,including any additional allocations needed for the protec- tion of critical forest areas or other critical natural habitats; procedures are in place to ensure that any harvesting operations or plantation development supported by World Bank financing are restricted to areas outside crit- ical forest areas or other critical natural habitats; the certification systems or community-based forest man- agement monitoring systems used to assess whether forest CHAPTER 9: APPLYING FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36 295harvesting supported by World Bank-financed investment projects meet appropriate standards of forest managementand use conform with the standards for these systems (as defined in paragraphs 10 and 11 of OP 4.36); projects with time-bound action plans to improve forest management include clearly defined performance bench-marks and time frames for achieving appropriate forest management standards (in accord with OP 4.36, para- graphs 9-12), and that any time-bound action plans andtheir associated performance benchmarks are included inthe PAD and made available to the public; and PADs include clear performance indicators that will enable the contribution of the project to the poverty reduction,macroeconomic, and conservation objectives of the World Bank's country assistance program to be assessed. Supervision requirements. The task team ensures that during project implementation monitoring and evaluation procedures are informed by the meaningful participation of locally affected commu-nities and other groups interested in forest areas affected by World Bank-financed investment projects; the integrity of the boundaries of any critical forest areas or other critical natural habitats in or near areas affectedby World Bank-financed investment projects is continu- ously monitored; the protection of the rights of access and use of forest areas by Indigenous Peoples and other local communi-ties is monitored in accord with the requirements of OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement and OP 4.10 Indigenous Peoples, and that any necessary corrective actions aretaken in accord with these policies; project performance is monitored against the indicators for the contribution of the project to the poverty reduc-tion, macroeconomic, and conservation objectives of the World Bank's country assistance program defined in the PAD; and that the client specifically makes available to the public the results of all forest management assessments carried outunder the independent certification systems and related time-bound action plans referred to in paragraphs 9-12 of OP 4.36. DEFINITIONS Forests and natural habitats. OP 4.36, annex A, defines \"forests\" rather broadly to include areas of at least 1 hectare, at any successional stage of tree growth, with tree crowncover of normally at least 10 percent and trees at least 2 meters tall (at maturity). This definition thus includes nat-ural (primary or secondary) forests, as well as forestry plan-tations of native or nonnative species. The definition alsotakes into account intended land uses (not just actual treecover, or the lack thereof) by (i) including areas dedicated toforest production, protection, multiple uses, or conserva-tion (whether formally recognized or not) and (ii) exclud-ing areas where other land uses not dependent on tree coverpredominate, such as agriculture, grazing, or settlements. OP 4.04, annex A, defines \"natural habitats\" as land and water areas where (i) the ecosystem is composed largely ofnative plant and animal species and (ii) human activity hasnot fundamentally altered the area's primary ecological func-tions. Natural habitats thus include natural forests of alltypes, as well as the full range of other kinds of natural ter-restrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Natural habitatsoften are not \"pristine\" but have been modified by humanactivities, such as logging, collection of nontimber forestproducts, hunting, fishing, or livestock grazing (on naturalrangelands). However, areas that still maintain a majority oftheir original native plant and animal species should be regarded as natural habitats, notwithstanding some (light ormoderate) degree of human modification. In accordance with these definitions (as well as those in normal professional usage outside the World Bank), naturalforests are a type of natural habitat. Other types of naturalecosystems (such as shrub lands, native grasslands, non-wooded wetlands, beaches, and coral reefs) are natural habi-tats, but not forests. Conversely, forestry plantations of non-native species are forests, but not natural habitats. Critical forests and critical natural habitats. OP 4.36, annex A, defines \"critical forest areas\" as the forest areas that qualify as \"critical natural habitats\" under theNatural Habitats OP 4.04. In summary, the Natural HabitatsPolicy defines \"critical natural habitats\" as those naturalhabitats that are either (i) legally protected or officially pro-posed for protection; or (ii) unprotected but of known highconservation value. In practical terms, critical natural habi- tats (including critical forests) can be regarded as relativelynatural areas that are either legally protected or reallyshould be, because of their conservation significance. Inmore specific and official terms, critical natural habitatscomprise the following types of areas (see OP 4.04, annex A, for the full World Bank policy text): Existing and proposed protected areas. Critical natu- ral habitats include (i) existing protected areas that meet the 296 CHAPTER 9: APPLYING FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36standard IUCN criteria for Categories I-VI; (ii) areas offi- cially proposed by governments as protected areas; (iii)areas recognized (before the proposed project) as protected by traditional local communities (such as sacred groves); and (iv) sites that maintain conditions vital for the viabilityof these protected areas. Unprotected areas of high conservation value. Criti- cal natural habitats include areas currently lacking status as existing or proposed protected areas, provided that they arerecognized by authoritative sources as (i) areas with knownhigh suitability for biodiversity conservation or (ii) sites thatare critical for one or more rare, vulnerable, migratory, or endangered species. Critical natural habitats typically appear on lists prepared by conservation experts outside (and some-times within) the World Bank. This helps to distinguish thegenuinely critical areas from the noncritical ones. A criticalnatural habitat site may appear on a list that existed beforethe preparation of the project proposed for World Bank sup-port. Alternatively, such a list might be developed during proj-ect preparation, as part of the environmental assessmentprocess (discussed below). In other words, a site could be eval-uated and classified as a critical natural habitat for the firsttime during World Bank preparation of a proposed project. Significance of forest conversion and degradation. For the Forests Policy, \"significant conversion\" and \"degra-dation\" are defined in OP 4.04, annex A, paragraph 1(c)-(d). (OP 4.36 cross-references OP 4.04 for this pur-pose.) This definition states that \"significant conversion is the elimination or severe diminution of the integrity of acritical or other natural habitat caused by a major, long-term change in land or water use. Significant conversionmay include, for example, land clearing; replacement of nat-ural vegetation (e.g., by crops or tree plantations); perma-nent flooding (e.g., by a reservoir); drainage, dredging, fill-ing, or channelization of wetlands; or surface mining. Inboth terrestrial and aquatic systems, conversion of naturalhabitats can occur as the result of severe pollution.\" In sim-ple terms, conversion is essentially the loss of an area of nat-ural habitat; determining the significance of a conversionmay be more complex (see below). OP 4.04 defines degradation as the \"modification of a critical or other natural habitat that substantially reducesthe habitat's ability to maintain viable populations of itsnative species.\" In this context, degradation is an environ-mental safeguards concept, rather than an economic one.Some land management or silvicultural treatments may beregarded as improvements from an economic perspective,but as degradation from an ecological standpoint. For example, the systematic removal of dead or dying trees, orspecies of low economic value, might be considered a man- agement improvement by providing more space to the trees of higher economic value; however, it could reduce the for-est's biodiversity and remove the habitat of birds and otherwildlife that depend upon snags. Further complexity isinvolved in choosing between the different wild species that benefit from different types of forest management interven-tions. While many species of conservation or other manage-ment interest depend upon primary or old-growth forests,some can survive only in logged, burned, or otherwise dis-turbed areas (such as young secondary forest, or grassy clearings). Good judgment is needed in choosing the appro- priate, site-specific forest management techniques to opti-mize between economic, social, and a variety of differentenvironmental objectives. The project team should seek toensure that the management objectives for a forested areaare explicit, transparent, and thoroughly discussed with thefull range of interested stakeholders. When is the scale of the proposed conversion or degra- dation of an area of forest (or other natural habitat) largeenough to qualify as significant? Neither OP . 4.36 nor 4.04provide numerical threshold figures; there is thus somecase-by-case flexibility, provided that decisions are well-jus- tified from a technical and scientific standpoint. When eval-uating the significance of a proposed conversion or degra-dation of forests or other natural habitats, it is important totake into account the cumulative effects of (i) multiple sub-projects under the same project; (ii) World Bank-financedrepeater projects; and (iii) concurrent projects financed byother sources. It is also necessary to consider the area ofeach specific forest (or other natural habitat) type to beaffected, in relative terms and (for still very extensive ecosys-tems) in absolute terms as well. In relative terms, an infor-mal rule of thumb, used at times in the World Bank, is toconsider the area of conversion or degradation to be signif-icant if it exceeds 1 percent of the remaining area of any spe-cific natural habitat type within the same country. One per-cent also happens to be the threshold for requiring naturalhabitat conservation offset measures in the EuropeanUnion's Habitats Directive, Article 6(4). In absolute terms, the substantively very similar Wild- lands OPN 11.02 that preceded OP 4.04 (and was in effect1987-95) suggested 10,000 hectares as a threshold figure,above which the conversion or degradation should be con-sidered significant, even for a very extensive ecosystem typewithin the same country (where the converted or degradedarea would be well under 1 percent of the remaining area). CHAPTER 9: APPLYING FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36 297However, some of the World Bank's environmental and bio- diversity specialists now suggest a lower figure, such as 5,000hectares. Although they provide no official threshold figure, both the Forests and Natural Habitats policies require the World Bank and clients to apply a precautionary approach(OP 4.36, footnote 4 and OP 4.04, paragraph 1). Thus, inborderline situations under scientific uncertainty, the pro-posed conversion or degradation should be considered sig- nificant, and the relevant safeguard measures applied (pro-ject redesign or inclusion of specific mitigation measures, asdiscussed above). The decision needs to be justified anddocumented in a scientifically credible manner (typicallywithin the PAD and EA report). It is important to remember that the significant conver- sion or degradation of forests or other natural habitats canoccur as a result of both (i) the direct impacts of a project(such as the civil works \"footprint\"); and (ii) the indirectimpacts of project-induced human activities. As stated inOP 4.04, annex A, paragraph 1(c), \"Conversion can resultdirectly from the action of a project or through an indirectmechanism (e.g., through induced settlement along aroad).\" The induced impacts of a project frequently accountfor more forest loss or degradation than the direct ones. Small-scale landholders and local communities. OP 4.36, footnote 13, notes that \"'small-scale is determinedby the national context of a given country and is generallyrelative to the average size of household forest landholdings.In some situations, small-scale landholders may control lessthan a hectare of forests; in others they may control 50hectares or more.\" Organized communities may own or oth-erwise control much larger tracts of forest (for example, upto several thousand hectares for some forest communities inthe mountains of Mexico). However, forestry by local com-munities can normally be distinguished from industrial-scale commercial forestry operations by some combinationof (i) community land tenure; (ii) long-term residence inthe forest area; (iii) traditional forms of social organization;(iv) dependence upon nontimber forest products (not justcash from the sale of timber); (v) low levels of capitaliza-tion; (vi) relative poverty, or other relevant characteristics. GUIDANCE ON DEVELOPMENT OF TERMS OF REFERENCE RELATED TO OP 4.36 OP 4.36 requires that appropriate analyses be undertaken to identify the social, economic, and environmental signifi-cance of forests and any activities that may affect the well- being of forests and the people who depend on them. T omeet those requirements, several analytical studies may be necessary. This section provides guidance on what shouldbe included in the terms of reference (TOR) for conductingassessments necessary under OP 4.36. In developing the TOR, it is important to consult other World Bank policies that are triggered or relevant, includingOP 4.04 Natural Habitats, OP 4.09 Pest Management, OP4.10 Indigenous Peoples (see chapter 12 , Applying OP 4.10on Indigenous Peoples), OP 4.11 Physical Cultural Resources,OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement, and Policy on Disclosureof Information. Consultation and communication with stakeholders are essential elements for the development and implementationof forest-related projects. Indeed, under OP 4.01, EAsrequire public consultations for review of draft plans bystakeholder groups, and if Indigenous Peoples are affected(whether positively or negatively), OP 4.10 requires aprocess of free, prior, and informed consultation withaffected Indigenous Peoples communities leading to theirbroad support to the project. The information in chapter10, Consultation and Communications in Forest Sector Activities, about stakeholder consultation can help to shapeall of the analyses discussed in this section on TOR. Thecommunication elements discussed in that chapter canassist in disseminating analysis results, as well as generatinglocal interest in and commitment to the project. A TOR must have certain sections, including a summary and background section, and a scope of work section. Thescope of work will be different for each project and willreflect the characteristics of the project. Likewise, the per-sonnel requirements and the balance of national and inter-national consultants will be unique. This section providesan indicative list of items for consideration in TORs forOP 4.36. A project would not necessarily require all theitems described here, nor is the list intended to be exhaus-tive. The emphasis on specific activities in a TOR willdepend on the objective of the project, site context, priorwork done, and other project-specific factors. Depending on the nature of the project and analyses required, the necessary analyses can be done independently or jointly. For simplicity, the key elements of each type ofanalysis are presented as distinct sections below. If questionsshould arise, please refer to OP 4.36. Summary and background. This section should provide an executive summary of the project, including a descrip- tion of: the rationale for the project; the broad objectives and scope of the project; an overview, including a summaryof the project and a brief discussion of timing; and the proj- 298 CHAPTER 9: APPLYING FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36ect management responsibilities and protocols. Addition- ally, this section sets the broad context for the project andprovides justification for the go als and scope of the project and the development approach to be taken. Potential components. This section provides a list of possible elements of the three main types of analyses: (i) a Social Assessment (which also includes assessment of insti- tutional issues), (ii) an Economic and Financial Analysis,and (iii) an Environmental Assessment. SOCIAL ASSESSMENT The objective of the Social Assessment (SA) is to examine var- ious social and institutional factors influencing the livelihoodof all forest-dependent soci al groups, including Indigenous Peoples, women and youth, and other vulnerable groups. As mentioned in OP 4.36. paragraph 14, this information should\"address, among other issues, the respective roles and legalrights of the government, the private sector, and local people.\" The stakeholder and socioeconomic analysis associated with an SA should assess likely positive or adverse impacts on stakeholders, including head loaders, cultivators, peopledependent on grazing lands, wage laborers, seasonalmigrants, women-supported households, and other forest-dependent people. It should also recommend ways that stakeholders can benefit from the project inputs. (For fur- ther information on consultation and stakeholder analysis,please see chapter 10, Consultation and Communication inForest Sector Activities.) The institutional analysis shouldensure that key actors in the project have the necessarycapacity, commitment, and incentives to implement andsustain the operation, and that the operation will have apositive impact on the country's public institutions. The consultant should focus on the following key com- ponents for this analysis: Stakeholder analysis Identify and describe key characteristics, and describe the relationships among stakeholders. Assess formal andinformal, codified and uncodified, and socially shared relationships. Assess the stake or interest in the project for each stake- holder group. This may include an assessment of poten-tial support or opposition, openness to change, and potential benefit from the project. Understand the underlying political economy by identi- fying and examining the relevant civil society organiza-tions and groups, as well as private sector actors, and NGOs. What are their agendas, constituencies, and linkswith other institutions? Socioeconomic analysis Examine people's relationships to the forest from a spir- itual and social standpoint. Examine people's degree of economic dependence on theforest. Assess practices such as shifting cultivation, thesustainability of these practices, and livelihood alterna- tives for the affected forest-dependent communities. Examine how dependence upon forests creates conflicts at intra- and inter-community levels. Examine village-level land-use patterns, tenure, and cus-tomary rights of private and common properties, andissues of indebtedness and land mortgage. Document and analyze needs, opportunities, and con-straints for marginalized, discriminated against, and mostvulnerable groups and individuals (Indigenous Peoples and women, for instance).

Participation framework describes the approach and process used to consult with different stakeholder groups. It explicitly includes measures to involve vulner- able people affected by the project in decision making, in receiving a share of benefits, and associated monitoring(see box 9.3). Stakeholder consultation workshops will enable stakehold- ers to provide information and opinions regarding issues of concerns in the assessment. The workshops use approaches and tools to elicit stakeholder inputs. Social impact report details the main social issues and interventions and assesses likely positive and negative impacts, as well as mitigation measures (see box 9.4).

Involving the stakeholders will require strategies equally as enterprising as those used to identify them. Some considerations for engaging different stakehold- ers include the type of interaction (for example, individual or group meetings and location);accommodation of the stakeholders' time constraints(and if key stakeholders are unable to attend meet-ings, considering keeping them informed through personal communication); the manner by which information will be exchanged; the purpose of such stakeholder communication (information sharing, data gathering, decision mak-ing, and so forth); coordination between the landscape planning teamand stakeholder groups to ensure viewpoints are con-veyed and received accurately; sharing of concepts and well-defined terminologywith the stakeholder groups to minimize confusion inthe planning process; use of an appropriate language and mode of commu-nication; and ensuring all actors have an accurate picture of theprocess and their roles in it.Box 9.2 Participation Strategy Source: World Bank 2005b. Based on the stakeholder analysis, a participationframework with specific systems and procedureswill be developed, which will describe the approach and process used to consult with differ- ent stakeholder groups to incorporate their viewsinto project design and implementation, and tocommunicate with them about the project. Theframework should identify ways and procedures in which the marginalized and the less vocal groupsand individuals can best participate in the processof group formation and micro-plan development.A detailed communications strategy should also bedeveloped for the project, largely based on thestakeholder analysis. The consultation process should be ongoing throughout the project's life; key stakeholders should continue to be consultedand involved.

Assess the project's likely positive and negative impacts\u2014in quantitative terms to the extentpossible\u2014on key stakeholders, particularly the poor and most vulnerable social groups that depend on forest resources. Identify mitigation measures and any residual negative impacts that cannot be mitigated. Assess the key (formal and informal) institutionsin the forestry sector that will be involved in thedelivery of the mitigation measures, evaluate their respective roles, capacity, and training needs. Spell out the mechanisms for participation of all affected stakeholder groups in design, imple-mentation, and monitoring of the social aspects of the reform and the project's implementation.

Source: World Bank 2005b.Box 9.4 Social Impact Report CHAPTER 9: APPLYING FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36 303The World Bank Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12) is triggered when World Bank-assistedinvestment projects cause the involuntary restriction of access to legally designated parks and protected areas. For purposes of this policy, involuntary restrictions ofaccess cover restrictions on the use of resourcesimposed on people living outside the park or protectedarea, or on those who continue living inside the park or protected area during and after project implementa-tion. In such projects, the nature of the restrictions, aswell as the type of measures necessary to mitigateadverse impacts, is determined with the participationof the displaced persons during the design and imple-mentation of the project. Given the potential impact of project activities that could result in the involuntary restriction of access toresources and livelihood for inhabitants of some of theareas covered by the project, a \"Process Framework\"(PF) is a condition of project appraisal. Usually a con-sultant or other entity is contracted to assist the gov-ernment in preparing this document. The draft PF is to be endorsed by the government and transmitted to the World Bank for review beforeproject appraisal. The final PF must be made availablein the borrowing country at a place accessible to, and ina form, manner, and language understandable to, thedisplaced or affected people and local NGOs. Impor- tant aspects of preparing the PF document are (i) theawareness of the national government of the risk ofimpact on the livelihoods of certain population groupsand (ii) agreement with the national government onhow to address these risks. The process framework describes the participatory process by which specific components of the project will be prepared and implemented; the criteria for eligibility will be determined; measures to assist the displaced persons in theirefforts to improve their livelihoods, or at least torestore them in real terms while maintaining the sustainability of the park of protected area, will be identified; and potential conflicts involving displaced persons will be resolved. The PF describe the site and impact areas and the activities that are likely to restrict access to forestresources and thereby affect the livelihoods of some population groups. These may, for instance, includemeasures to curtail illegal logging, poaching, andhunting; fishing; restrictions on collecting other forestproducts, such as herbal plants and mushrooms; orusing forest areas for grazing or farming. The PF will,to the extent possible, estimate the magnitude of theimpact caused by the particular activity, including, forexample, in the case of illegal logging, issues such aswhat is considered illegal logging by the law; what isthe actual interpretation of this law by local officials;what is the enforcement record of their current inter-pretation; what are the chances for an effective elimi-nation of illegal logging across the country; whatwould a clampdown on illegal logging really mean;what is the magnitude of the impact from the stake-holders' point of view; who does illegal logging; are there any regional disparities, ethnic patterns, and soforth; for what purpose do they do illegal logging(cooking, heating, subsistence, commercial); is it aseasonal or regular activity; what is the degree ofdependence on the acquired wood (financial or inkind); what are other sources of income and how sus-tainable are they; what is the likely coping mechanismby those affected in the case of a successful or semi-successful clampdown on illegal logging; is a potentialsuccessful clampdown on illegal logging likely to forcethose affected to move to other areas, and if so, whichareas; what other changes in regard to livelihood andbehavior are likely to be triggered by governmentefforts to curtail illegal logging; and other pertinentissues. Given the nature and magnitude of the impact, the PF can also suggest the likely mitigation measures thatwill be put into place, and the implementationprocess. But the thrust of the PF is the description ofthe participatory process by which these decisions will be made rather than the decisions themselves. Theaction and mitigation plans\u2014their integration andcoordination with other project components\u2014are aniterative process and will evolve through the project.The PF also includes a description of the arrange- ments for implementation and monitoring theprocess and records of interagency and consultationmeetings, including consultations with affected peopleon their views.Box 9.5 Process Framework for Involuntary Access Restrictions (Box continues on the following page. )Qualifications of consultants for social assessment. The consultant or team of consultants should have the fol-lowing qualifications: practical experience in designing and implementing par-ticipatory natural resource management projects, inassessing and addressing interests of vulnerable people, and an ability to manage interdisciplinary teams detailed local knowledge of social issues related to natu- ral resource management, including usage of forest andagriculture resources and community practices involving natural resources familiarity with the legal framework for usufruct rights and access experience with local forest or forest-related social issues operational experience in social survey methods ability to engage with local people and keep an openmind to new approaches ability to speak local languages Additional qualifications might include the following: extensive experience in microenterprise development; familiarity with microfinance and revolving fundoptions, marketing issues, and regulatory climate experience with assessing structure, capacity, and inter-linkages of national and community-level organizations knowledge of national and local institutions extensive experience in community development andparticipatory planningoperational experience in analysis and design of commu-nication activities and dissemination materials extensive professional background in human resourcesdevelopment, including experience with training needsassessment, building analytical and problem-solving skills, and participative and interactive approaches to training Economic and financial analysis This analysis should examine the various economic and financial factors affecting a forest-related project to enhancethe economic efficiency of the project and address distribu- tional questions. An economic analysis compares economic and social benefits to the economy as a whole. The financialanalysis compares revenue and expenses, like operationsand maintenance costs. It is important to understand the economic value of forests that are affected by the project. In addition to forest products and services, this valuation should include non-market uses of forests, such as environmental services, socialuses, and subsistence uses. In particular, the consultant should focus on the follow- ing key components for this analysis: Economic importance evaluate direct use of forests arising from consumptive and nonconsumptive uses: timber, fruits, nuts, mushrooms,medicinal plants, forage, hunting and fishing, tourism and recreation, genetic resources, and educational uses 304 CHAPTER 9: APPLYING FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36It would be useful to keep in mind that the review of the PF at the World Bank is based on five key crite- ria: Policy- agreement on basic principles, entitlement framework, criteria, and so forth - formal endorsement by the government Analysis and documentation- census, surveys as required- analysis of social groups, with special emphasis on risk and vulnerabilityMeaningful consultation and disclosure- documentation of consultation processes and implications for project design and implementa- tion mechanisms - public disclosure of relevant information in local languages Action and mitigation plans - budget provision and clear responsibilities- supervision, monitoring, and evaluation mecha- nisms established Institutional capacity and commitment- evidence plans are realistic, can be implemented Box 9.5 Process Framework for Involuntary Access Restrictions (continued) Sources: World Bank 2005b. evaluate indirect use of forests: watershed and soil pro- tection, wind breaks, climate control, and nutrientcycling evaluate options values, including future direct and indi-rect uses evaluate off-site and on-site economic effects; also evalu-ate private costs and benefits versus social costs and ben-efits, with attention to market failures, policy-induced distortions, and externalities evaluate nontimber values like health, carbon sequestra- tion, and alternative livelihood strategies assess the incremental or additional costs associated withtransforming a project with national benefits into onewith global environmental benefits, for Global Environ- ment Facility projects Financial analysis evaluate the financial viability of investments like refor- estation, microenterprises, and so forth; also evaluaterisk and market accessconduct a financial analysis from the perspectives of var-ious stakeholders undertake a cost-benefit analysis (see box 9.6) base decisions, to the extent possible, on a total economicvaluation of forest resources, that is, an estimate of thevalue of all economic benefits that a society derives from its forests (see box 9.7) Potential methodology review of primary and secondary data sources rapid Rural Appraisal interviews, including stakeholder interviews, question- naires, village-based surveys for livelihood analysis(including wealth ranking, group interviews, process analysis) Cost-benefit analysis Market analysis (see box 9.8) Contingent valuation Quantitative measures, including TEV , internal rate of return, net present value CHAPTER 9: APPLYING FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36 305A detailed cost-benefit analysis will be undertaken during project preparation, taking into accountthe issues of economic importance and financial analysis and using quantitative models. Incremen- tal costs and benefits of project investments will beexamined in detail, and economic and financialrates of return calculated. Cost-effectiveness analy-sis will be conducted on alternative plantation and protection techniques. The analysis will alsoinclude the preparation of indicative economicand financial models for participatory manage-ment of forests by locals, including analysis ofalternative land uses. The economists will alsoundertake sensitivity analysis on key risks and dis- cuss implications for project design. The quantified cost-benefit analysis will be sup- plemented by an analysis of other environmental benefits not as readily conducive to financial quan-tification (for example, biodiversity, climaticchanges), which, where appropriate, will take intoaccount physical measurements and least-costanalysis of any associated marginal costs of inter-ventions specific to those benefits. Source: World Bank 2003a. Box 9.6 Cost-Benefit Analysis Total economic valuation (TEV) is a method used to identify and estimate the value of all eco- nomic benefits that a society derives from its forests. As such, TEV extends well beyond the scope of financial analyses of forest values thatconcentrate almost exclusively on timber, toaccount for the great variety of other products andservices provided by a forest system. The TEV of a forest is the sum its use and nonuse values. Usevalues are, in turn, divided into direct, indirect,and option values; while nonuse values includebequest and existence values. Examples of the var-ious use values include Direct uses\u2014timber, fruits, nuts, mushrooms, medicinal plants, forage, hunting and fishing,tourism and recreation, genetic resources, and educational uses Indirect uses\u2014watershed and soil protection, wind breaks, climate control, and nutrientcycling Option\u2014future direct and indirect uses Source: World Bank 2003a.Box 9.7 T otal Economic ValuationPotential products.

Cost-benefit analysis. An examination of incremental costs and benefits of project investments. Calculates eco- nomic and financial rates of return. Includes indicative economic and financial models for participatory man- agement of forests by locals, analysis of alternative landuses, and undertakes sensitivity analysis on key risks. Itshould be supplemented by analysis of less quantifiableenvironmental benefits (for example, biodiversity, cli- matic changes). Market analysis. An assessment of current and potential market conditions for forest and rangeland products and the associated policy reform ramifications. Local public goods assessment. An assessment of environ- mental services and potential payment arrangements,which may include special adjustments to ensure inclu- sion of women and vulnerable groups, and reward good performance. Incentive framework. A description of arrangements and policy incentives to ensure ongoing economic decision making (see box 9.10). Poverty impact analysis. An analysis of the project impact on poverty (opportunity, empowerment, and security)that addresses household income, stakeholder groups, loss of access to forest resources, and seasonal vulnera- bility (see box 9.11).

Thenational consultants may need to learn Costabthrough the built-in self-tutorial and advice from World Bank staff, and establish an appropriate struc-ture and parameters for assembly of cost estimates. Source: World Bank 2003a.Box 9.9 Cost Estimates Because many of the technical and expenditure choices will need to be made within a site-specificcontext, the project will need to build in arrange- ments and policy incentives to ensure economic decision making on an ongoing basis. For example,in the participatory forest management pilots thatinvolve economic benefits to local communities,local selection of site-specific investments could be made within a fixed budget constraint, with initialinvestment funds and subsequent revenue chan-neled through community-managed accounts. Theinvestments could also be made subject to a require-ment that beneficiaries contribute their ownresources, at least in the form of labor. For these sorts of investments, detailed formal cost-benefit analysis of each investment would be prohibitively expensiveat the local level. Instead, working with the commu-nity involvement consultant, an approach will bedeveloped whereby a budget constraint, fund man-agement, and contribution requirement would fos-ter cost-benefit analysis and marginal utility maxi-mizing decisions on an intuitive basis.

The consultant or team of consultants should have the following qualifications: extensive operational experience with skills in cost-bene-fit analysis modeling, environmental economics, non-market valuation techniques, participatory rural appraisal, policy analysis, and reform \"no-project\" option); and recommend measures to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts, andto improve the environmental conditions and impact man- agement performance. The EA should focus special atten- tion on developing guidelines and procedures for identify-ing and measuring conservation and sustainable-useobjectives. The document should be prepared according to World Bank guidelines, as set out in OP 4.01 (see World Bank, Environmental Assessment Sourcebook). This information is not intended to supersede EA guidelines presented elsewhere, but instead to supplementthose guidelines with information specific to forest-related projects. In particular, the assessment could examine the follow- ing key components: Assess the key environmental concerns in the forestry sector. The assessment should focus on key environmental con-cerns in the forest sector that are relevant to the proposed project. Identify and describe critical forests or critical natural habitats. (See the section of this chapter titled Identifying Critical Forests and Critical Natural Habitats through Environmental Assessment). Describe ecosystem type(s), species of conservation concern, natural or cultural fea-tures, existing or proposed legal protection, threats, andother information relevant to decision making. Assess critical ecosystems and recommend a program for their conservation and management. This might also include supporting community-driven conservation ini- tiatives, integrating conservation components into par- ticipatory forest management and forest development,and supporting participatory biodiversity monitoring. Develop quantitative indicators and a baseline for moni- toring changes. This is to monitor changes in the natural environment (both positive and negative) that may result from project activities. Define a methodology for data collection and assessment (see box 9.14). Assess threats to cultural heritage (archaeological, reli- gious, and cultural properties and resources). Evaluate the potential to improve protection of such resources, and monitoring and screening methods to be imple- mented in project areas. Assess the impact of the project on the natural environ- ment. Evaluated impacts might include the benefits to soil and water regimes, species conservation and diver- sity, and ecological stability. From a negative perspective, the EA should evaluate the potential impacts of projectinterventions on the physical and biological environ- ments. In addition, the EA should include an analysisand understanding of the issues related to wildlife habi-tats and populations in the project areas, and the impli-cations of shifting populations of wild animals on tribalcommunities and their access to forestry resources. Review legal, administrative, and institutional frameworks relevant to the proposed project. Involve communities in planning, implementing, andassessing the results and impacts of the project. Stakehold- ers (including people affected by the project, NGOs, and other relevant groups) should be incorporated through- out the project, both in planning and implementation. Strengthen capacity at local, entity, and state levels for bio- diversity conservation and sustainable management prac-tices. The project could finance professional develop- ment, management training, ranger training, business planning, and forest management planning at the ecosys-tem level, and capacity building for national ministries. Where relevant, identify, establish, or expand sustainably managed protected areas (PA). For all PAs, the project should establish a biodiversity monitoring system at the site, entity, and state levels. Improve local benefits originating from protected areas. Involve and provide incentives (possibly through smallgrants) for stakeholders living in and around PAs to ensure long-term sustainability through the develop- ment of alternative, environmentally sensitive income-generation based on sustainable resource use that wouldbring economic benefits to local people. 308 CHAPTER 9: APPLYING FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36T ools to develop quantitative indicators and a baseline for monitoring changes in the naturalenvironment (both positive and negative) that may result from project activities and define a methodology for data collection and assessmentshould be implemented.

The EMP should include mitigation mea-sures, institutional strengthening, training, and moni-toring, as follows: Mitigation of environmental impacts. Recommend feasible and cost-effective measures to prevent or reduce significant negative impacts to acceptable levels. Estimate the impacts and costs of those mea- sures. Consider compensation to affected parties forimpacts that cannot be mitigated. The plan shouldinclude proposed work programs, budget estimates,schedules, staffing, and training requirements, and other necessary support services to implement themitigating measures. Institutional strengthening and training. Identificationof institutional needs to implement EA recommen-dations. Recommend any additional support thatshould be provided to the PA management institu-tions, the project implementation units, the relevantministries, and others, to strengthen or expand themso that the management and monitoring plans in theEA can be implemented. The institutional needsshould be presented separately for the two entities. Monitoring. Prepare detailed arrangements for monitoring implementation of mitigating measures and the impacts of the project during construction and operation. Include in the plan an estimate of capital and operating costs, and a description ofother inputs (such as training and institutionalstrengthening) needed to carry it out. It should be noted that the EMP must be incorpo- rated by reference in the legal agreement for the project. As a result, the EMP must be clear and coherent to sup-port any efforts to determine compliance with the EMP .Box 9.16 Environmental Management Plan Source: World Bank 2003b. Determine the potential positive and negative environmental and social impacts of the projectwith respect to the proposed PAs, including already defined and proposed expansions.

Box 9.17 Assessment of Environmental Impacts and Proposed Mitigation MeasuresCHAPTER 9: APPLYING FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36 311The consultant is expected to develop an environmen- tal and social management framework (ESMF) thatestablishes methodologies for environmental and social impact assessment within the project prepara- tion, approval, and implementation processes, includ-ing the preparation of an environmental mitigationplan and a resettlement action plan. Specific activitiesinclude the following: Providing the description of the environmental and social characteristics of the PA and description of thebiophysical and socioeconomic environment. Identi- fying links between different types of livelihood and sustainable environment management in the PA. Outlining the provisions under national legislation, policies, and regulations regarding the environmen-tal and social impacts that are relevant to the char- acteristics of the PA. Assessing the consistencies of these with the standards and procedures of theWorld Bank regarding environmental and socialsafeguard policies. Designing and clearly outlining methodology for preparation, approval, and execution of subpro-jects. The consultant is expected to provide infor- mation for project preparation from design process to approval. Assessing and documenting the implementation capacity of collaborating institutions at the local,regional, and national levels; proposing ways of strengthening the capacity to manage and provide training; and providing an estimate of the costs forimplementing the environmental and social controlplan. Developing an elaborate ESMF, which would include recommending feasible measures for pre-venting or reducing impacts, such as a resettlement action plan and other mitigation measures as iden- tified during the ESMF. Developing a resettlement action plan that establishes- potential impacts of the project on people and properties; - regulatory and institutional context for land tenure; - evaluation of assets and rate of compensation; - complaint system management; - identification, assistance, and provisions to be included in the resettlement plan for vulnerablegroups; - consultation and diffusion of information, describing the consultation framework forpreparation of the resettlement plan and the framework for its diffusion to stakeholders; - responsibilities for implementation; specifically Describing the institutional setting for the imple- mentation of the resettlement plan. Proposing the composition and tasks of a jointcommittee for liaison between the affected commu-nities and local structures in charge of implementa- tion of the resettlement plan. Designing a clear communications strategy for information dissemination to all stakeholders. Developing a participatory monitoring and evalua-tion plan for the implementation of the pro-posed mitigation measures. The plan should clearly indicate - the link between the impacts identified in the EMSF report, the indicators for measuring theseimpacts, data collection methods, and the timeplan for monitoring and evaluating these impacts; and - institutional responsibilities for monitoring indirect and direct impacts, as well as responsi-bilities for supervision, the frequency of moni-toring and reporting mechanisms, and thebudget for the monitoring and evaluation plan.Box 9.18 Environmental and Social Management Framework Source: World Bank 2006. stitute critical forests or other critical natural habitats is the EA process under OP 4.01. The EA report required of allCategory A, B, and FI projects should be used to identify any critical natural habitats within the proposed project's area of influence. It is thus essential for the EA TOR to direct the EAstudy team to identify those forests and other natural habi-tats within the proposed project area that should qualify ascritical natural habitats, in accordance with the above-men- tioned criteria of OP 4.04 and 4.36. For any areas thatappear to qualify as critical forests or other critical natural habitats, the EA report should indicate the official and common names for the site; ecosystem types; map location(s); approximate surface area; size of the proposed project-affected area, relative to the same ecosystem type(s) within the same country; species of conservation concern or special managementinterest known (or suspected) to occur, and (if known)their estimated populations (in absolute terms and rela- tive to the rest of the country or world); special concentrations of migratory or other species; other natural or cultural features of special interest; land ownership; existing or proposed legal protection (if any); on-the-ground protection and management (if any); who controls and influences land- and water-use deci- sions; types and intensity of current or recent human uses; existing and potential future threats to the natural habi-tats; and other information relevant to decision making. In the course of project preparation (before appraisal), the World Bank interprets and evaluates the findings of the EA report\u2014along with any supplementary sources of rele-vant information\u2014and determines which project areas (ifany) indeed qualify as critical forests or other critical natu-ral habitats, in terms of applying the safeguards require- ments of the Forests and Natural Habitats policies. In caseswhere the World Bank's judgment differs from the recom-mendations of the EA report, the former overrides. It is thusimportant that this decision be made with inputs from tech-nically qualified World Bank staff and other specialists (as needed), in a manner that is credible and convincing from a scientific standpoint. Complementary means of identifying critical forests and critical natural habitats. Although the EA process is the official, World Bank-endorsed mechanismfor identifying critical forests and other critical naturalhabitats, there are complementary sources of informationthat project teams (World Bank staff as well as their govern-ment or NGO counterparts) should use. These additionalsources of information are important (i) for preliminaryassessment of the presence, nature, and extent of critical forests and other critical natural habitats before the EAreport is available; (ii) to help verify the validity and com-pleteness of the EA report with respect to this issue; and (iii)to provide, as needed, supplementary information useful fordecision making regarding project design. Broadly speak-ing, these complementary information sources compriseexperts to be consulted, and useful publications and elec- tronic databases. This type of complementary informationshould be backed up by up-to-date, project-specific fieldstudies (as needed) during the EA process. Experts to be consulted. As part of the EA process, and also to obtain independent verification, it is essential to con- sult experts knowledgeable about the locations and signifi-cance of critical forests and other critical natural habitatswithin a country or a proposed project area. The types ofexperts who should normally be consulted include the fol-lowing: Regional Safeguards Unit within the World Bank should be a useful first point of contact for advice about the pos- sible presence and significance of critical forests and other critical natural habitats within a proposed project area. Government agencies (at the national or subnational level) responsible for protected areas, natural resource manage- ment, or the environment in general, which usually have up-to-date lists of existing and officially proposed pro- tected areas. Some also have authoritative information onunprotected areas of high conservation value. Conservation NGOs (national or international), which often have high-quality information about critical forests and other natural habitats. They are frequently also proj- ect stakeholders and sometimes partners. Expert individuals with specialized knowledge about sites of interest, who can often be found in universities and research institutions, at the national or international level. Public consultation, which is primarily a vehicle to ensure stakeholder participation in the decision-making process, but can provide information about critical nat- ural habitats not obtained from other sources. For exam- ple, the World Bank first learned that the site proposedfor a solid waste landfill on the Caribbean island ofGrenada was the habitat of the critically endangeredGrenada dove (Leptotila wellsi) as the result of a public consultation held in 1994, even though the initial EAreport for the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States(OECS) Solid Waste Management Project failed to men-tion this issue. Useful publications and electronic databases. A vari- ety of documents and Web sites provide lists, brief descrip-tions, and map locations for critical natural habitat sites\u2014including many outside existing protected areas\u2014in a large 312 CHAPTER 9: APPLYING FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36number of countries. These information sources should be regarded as useful \"first approximations\" of the locationsand characteristics of many, though not all, critical natural habitats. Geographic sites that do not appear on any of these lists might still qualify as critical forests or other critical nat-ural habitats, based on the above-mentioned criteria andthe World Bank's review of the EA report and other relevantinformation during project preparation. The following is a partial list of some useful publications and electronic data-bases (see the Selected Readings list for this chapter for fullbibliographic information). World Bank Publications Ecologically Sensitive Sites in Africa (World Bank 1993); Protected Areas Systems Review of the Indo-Malayan Realm (with maps showing existing and proposed pro- tected areas in East and South Asian countries; MacKin- non 1997); Critical Natural Habitats in Latin America and the Caribbean (World Bank n.d.); and for marine critical natural habitats proposed for protec-tion, A Global Representative System of Marine Protected Areas (four volumes covering the world's oceans and seas; Kelleher, Bleakley, and Wells 1995). Important Bird Areas. Important Bird Areas (IBAs) are sites that are of global significance for bird conservation, partic- ularly of threatened species. They can be regarded as a very significant subset of critical natural habitats, because sitesimportant for bird conservation tend also to be importantfor the conservation of other biodiversity as well\u2014althoughnot all critical natural habitats also qualify as IBAs. BirdLifeInternational and its national partner organizations have recently published a number of books (as hard copies and sometimes also as compact discs) that list and brieflydescribe all the currently known IBAs at a national andregional level, including, among others, Bird Areas in Africa and Associated Islands: Pri-ority Sites for Conservation (Fishpool and Evans 2001); Important Bird Areas in Europe: Priority Sites for Conser-vation (Heath and Evans 2000); Important Bird Areas of the Tropical Andes, covers Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia (Boylaand Estrada 2005); Important Bird Areas in Zambia (Leonard 2005); and Key Sites for Conservation in Cambodia (2003). The list of IBAs by country can also be accessed elec- tronically via www.birdlife.org. Alliance for Zero Extinction Sites. The Alliance for Zero Extinc- tion (AZE) is an alliance of international NGOs, including the World Wildlife Fund, Conservation International, The Nature Conservancy, Wildlife Conservation Society, BirdLife Interna-tional, American Bird Conservancy, and numerous national-level conservation NGOs. AZE sites are discrete areas wheremost or all of the population of a critically endangered or endangered animal or plant species occurs (all or part of the year). As such, AZE sites are among the most critical of endan- gered natural habitats (including forests). Around 700 AZEsites worldwide have been identified; they are listed by coun-try at www.zeroextinction.org. A link to Google Earth becameoperational in October 2006, which enables users to view thesite in reasonable detail on their computers. Wetlands and Marine Habitats Directories. Wetlands that are likely to qualify as critical natural habitats (including wooded freshwater swamps and mangroves that wouldqualify as critical forests) are listed and described in severalpublished wetlands directories, including the following Directory of African Wetlands (Hughes and Hughes 1992); Directory of Asian Wetlands (Scott 1989); and Directory of Neotropical Wetlands, covers Latin America and the Caribbean (Scott and Carbonell 1986). Those wetlands that have been designated as Wetlands of International Importance under the Ramsar Wetlands Con- vention are listed and mapped in the Ramsar Sites Directory and Overview (Wetlands International 2005), available online at www.wetlands.org. Marine coral reefs (most of which would qualify as criti- cal natural habitats) are covered in Coral Reefs of the World (Wells 1988). National-Level Directories and Databases. Some countries have published lists and descriptions of their critical natural habitats, or broadly comparable areas. A good example is CHAPTER 9: APPLYING FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36 313the detailed Biodiversidade Brasileira book published by Brazil's Environment Ministry (2002). High Conservation Value Forests. Note 3.1, Mainstreaming Conservation Considerations into Productive Landscapes, discusses the (optional) planning methodology for desig-nating High Conservation Value Forests (HCVFs). Accord-ing to the HCVF T oolkit (available online at www.hcvf.org), HCVFs are those forests considered to be \"of outstandingsignificance or critical importance,\" according to six HighConservation Value (HCV) criteria. Three of these six crite-ria (HCV 1, 3, and 6) correspond very closely to the above-mentioned OP 4.36 criteria for critical forests. Thus, forests designated as HCVFs under the HCVF methodology are likely to also qualify as critical forests under the Forests Pol-icy. Moreover, if their selection as HCVFs was made accord-ing to HCV criteria 1, 3, or 6, then they would almost cer-tainly qualify as critical forests under OP 4.36. As noted inNote 3.1, while many HCVFs are likely to be placed understrict protection, some HCVFs may be subject to limitedtimber harvesting or other direct resource uses\u2014so long asthe particular HCVs that are characteristic of those forestswould be maintained or enhanced, and not degraded orlost. This is consistent with OPs 4.36 and 4.04, which do notprohibit natural resource utilization within critical forests or other critical natural habitats\u2014only their conversion ordegradation (as defined above). PROTECTING FORESTS THROUGH CONSERVATION OFFSETS The Forests and Natural Habitats policies require, under some circumstances, the establishment or strengthening ofecologically similar protected areas to compensate for, or \"offset,\" the project-related conversion or degradation of noncritical forests and other natural habitats. Conservationoffsets can be a valuable tool to leverage the funds frominfrastructure or other large-scale development projects(that convert noncritical forests or other natural habitats) to achieve \"win-win\" outcomes that represent net gains from aconservation standpoint. Compensatory protected areasprovide an opportunity to turn a negative project feature(natural habitat loss) into something environmentally posi-tive (new or strengthened protected areas). In response to this requirement of the Forests and Natural Habitats poli- cies, some important forested areas are being effectivelyconserved\u2014whereas, without the project, they would haveremained unprotected and vulnerable to loss or damagefrom other, often imminent, threats. Through the prudentapplication of conservation offsets, many potentially con- troversial development projects can yield significant netenvironmental benefits and even turn some, though not all,NGO project opponents into supporters. One recent example of a large-scale conservation offset supported by the World Bank is the extensive and biologi-cally valuable Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area in the Lao People's Democratic Republic, which is receivingmuch needed on-the-ground support for its protection andmanagement as an offset for the inundation of a muchsmaller, and generally less ecologically valuable, forested areaby the Nam Theun II hydroelectric dam. The protected areawas set up after the World Bank worked with the governmentto develop a law that established a national protected areassystem and included the Nakai-Nam Theun National Pro-tected Area by reference through government decree. When protected areas are established or strengthened to compensate for the loss or degradation of noncritical forestsor other natural habitats, the funding for these compensa-tory areas should come from the same project causing theconversion or degradation. The Global Environment Facil-ity (GEF) does not fund activities intended to mitigate orcompensate for the environmental damage from IBRD- orIDA-supported projects. However, the GEF will supportbiodiversity-related or other qualified environmental enhancement activities (including protected areas), if theseclearly go above and beyond the project mitigation requiredby national laws and World Bank safeguards policies. Under the Forests and Natural Habitats policies, compen- satory protected areas should be ecologically similar to, and ideally no smaller than, the forest or other natural habitat areathat is converted or degraded under the overall project. How-ever, it is acceptable (and desirable) to conserve as an offset anarea that is ecologically somewhat different, if it is of greater conservation value. For example, under Brazil's Ceara Inte-grated Water Resources Management Project, the flooding ofsome relatively common dry forest with water supply reser-voirs was compensated for with support for improved con- servation of several moist forest areas (of higher conservationpriority) in the Sierra de Baturite and Chapada da Araripe. See box 9.19 for an indicative list of the main steps involved in creating new protected areas (regardless ofwhether they serve as conservation offsets). Among the basicissues to consider in the establishment or strengthening ofprotected areas as conservation offsets are the following: Fundamentals of protected area components. If they are to be more than empty promises, components involving compensatory protected areas (or virtually any other 314 CHAPTER 9: APPLYING FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36environmental mitigation measures) all need, before appraisal, (i) an implementation schedule; (ii) a cleardivision of institutional responsibilities; (iii) an itemized budget; (iv) an identified source of funds, for investment as well as recurrent costs; and (v) the legal framework tosupport the establishment and protected status of thearea. Interinstitutional coordination. In most infrastructure projects with natural habitats components, the institu- tion in charge of protected areas is different from the exe- cuting agency for the main civil works. The protectedareas component should be implemented as soon as pos- sible in relation to the main civil works, to ensure that (i)the conservation area is fully implemented within the lifeof the project and (ii) the main civil works do not dam-age (directly or indirectly) the conservation area beforekey protection and management measures are in place. Multiple uses of protected areas. Most protected areas allow various kinds of direct human uses. Different cate- gories of protected areas allow different types of non- consumptive, and sometimes consumptive, uses of natu- ral resources.2Protected areas should typically have a CHAPTER 9: APPLYING FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36 315Phase I: V erifying the Feasibility of Establishing a Protected Area1.Documenting the conservation value. This ecological evaluation (or similarly named) report should ver- ify that the proposed protected area is (i) of highconservation value for biodiversity or other envi-ronmental criteria (fishery habitat, flood protec-tion, or the like); and (ii) if a conservation offset area, ecologically similar to, or of even greater con-servation value than, the area that would be lost ordegraded under the overall project. 2.Documenting land tenure, use, and occupation. This land tenure and socioeconomic report should indi-cate (i) who owns all the land comprising the poten- tial protected area, (ii) who has any concessions or use rights, and (iii) who is currently occupying orusing the land (even if they lack legal rights). Phase II: Choosing the Boundaries and ManagementCategory of the Protected Area3. The two reports produced during Phase I determines whether a protected area is feasible. If the protectedarea is feasible, the ecological evaluation and landtenure and socioeconomic reports are used to decide,in consultation with local residents, conservationNGOs, and other key stakeholders, (i) the preciseboundaries (shown on a map) and (ii) the official management category of the new protected area. Phase III: Legal Establishment of the Protected Area4. A decree (executive order) or law is approved to establish the new protected area. The decree or lawshould specify the precise boundaries and official management category of the protected area. Phase IV: On-the-Ground Implementation of the Protected Area5.Physical demarcation. The protected area boundaries are marked in the field, using signs, concrete monu-ments, cleared paths, or fences (as appropriate). 6.Basic infrastructure and equipment. Much of this should be provided during the first year of pro- tected area implementation and itemized in the firstAnnual Operating Plan (AOP), which should befinalized before the first year. 7.Protected area staff. The needed personnel (includ- ing government employees, contracted local people,NGO staff, volunteers, and other) should be speci-fied in each year's AOP , as well as in the manage-ment plan. 8.Management plan. Normally, the terms of reference for producing the management plan should be pre-pared before the first year, and the plan itself shouldbe prepared during the first year (with ample stake-holder consultation) and implemented in subse-quent years. The management plan should ideallybe viewed as a living document, subject to revisionfrom time to time. 9.Recurrent cost funding. The commitment of a gov- ernment agency or NGO to provide long-term funding for the recurrent costs of protected areamanagement (mostly salaries and fuel) should besecured at the earliest possible date.Box 9.19 Typical Procedures for Establishing New Protected Areas Source: Edec 2006. a. A law may be preferred because in many countries, while a law may take more time and expense to prepare, it may also be more difficult to reverse than a decree.management plan\u2014prepared in a participatory manner with all major stakeholders\u2014that specifies which activi-ties are allowed, in which zones. Land tenure. In general, new protected areas are easiest to establish on public (state-owned) lands. Under the rightconditions, protected areas can also be established on communally owned indigenous lands, or on large indi- vidual landholdings (with legal safeguards to ensurelong-term management and recognition of IndigenousPeoples and other community rights). The World BankFinancing OP 6.00 (approved in April 2004) authorizes the use of IBRD and IDA funds for land acquisition for awide range of project purposes, including protected areaestablishment and consolidation. For details, see the\"Guidance Note on World Bank Financing of LandAcquisition for Protected Areas,\" an internal World Bank document available from the Operations Policy and Country Services intranet site http://opcs.worldbank.org/eligibility/1guide.html. Social safeguards. World Bank-supported protected areas need to be established and strengthened in a manner consistent with the Indigenous Peoples OP 4.10 and the Involuntary Resettlement OP 4.12 (see chapters 8 and 12 for a brief summary of their requirements). NOTES 1. The environmental classification of any investment project should be justified and explained in the ISDS and PAD. 2. The World Conservation Network (IUCN) protected area categories are a standardized classification system for similar types of protected areas that may have very different names indifferent countries. For example, a \"forest reserve\" in one coun- try may mean an area of strict preservation (Category I), whilein another it might mean a production forest suitable for com-mercial logging (Category VI). The IUCN categories relevantto the Natural Habitats OP 4.04 and Forests OP 4.36 are as fol-lows: I: Strict Nature Reserve/Wilderness Area (protected areamanaged for science or wilderness protection); II: NationalPark (protected area managed mainly for ecosystem protection and recreation); III: Natural Monument (protected area man- aged mainly for conservation of specific natural features); IV:Habitat/Species Management Area (protected area managedmainly for conservation through management intervention);V: Protected Landscape/Seascape (protected area managedmainly for landscape/seascape conservation and recreation);and VI: Managed Resource Protected Area (protected areamanaged mainly for the sustainable use of natural ecosystems).SELECTED READINGS Angehr, G. 2003.

CHAPTER 9: APPLYING FORESTS POLICY OP 4.36 317Forests are the meeting point for the diverse interests of a wide variety of stakeholders. For the private sec-tor, forests are a lucrative source of income and opportunity for investment. For the state, forests are a source of revenue and power. For forest-dependent house-holds, the resource base is an important element of thehousehold portfolio. For conservation entities, forests arerepositories of biological diversity and critical habitat or ecosystems. This makes forest sector projects complex andmultifaceted. The projects potentially have issues of con-flicting vested interests, states unwilling to relinquish con-trol of the resource, livelihood issues involving local forestuses and indigenous groups, as well as problems of illegal extraction and much more. Consultation and communication in forest sector proj- ects are important to build coalitions, manage risk, create transparency, and formalize mechanisms for participationand responses to stakeholder concerns. Consultationenables the involvement of indigenous groups and othermarginalized and vulnerable groups (including women andyouth). A well-designed communications strategy facilitatestransparency while contributing to the long-term sustain-ability of a project. The two strategies are intertwined. Con-sultation requires communication and communicationenhances and is reinforced by consultation. The first section of this chapter addresses consultation in forest sector projects. The second section addresses commu- nication. Although there are times when consultation andcommunication may be stand-alone components of a proj- ect, they are generally part of an integrated approach inwhich safeguards play a critical role (see chapter 9, Applying Forests Policy OP 4.36). Furthermore, the terms of reference (TOR) provided in chapter 9 may be helpful in developingconsultation and communication approaches. Chapter 12describes the additional requirements when IndigenousPeoples are affected, including the need for free, prior, and informed consultations with affected communities leadingto their broad support for the project. CONSULTATION In this chapter, consultation refers to the inclusion of all representative groups of stakeholders. Another form of con-sultation is consultation among donors\u2014sharing informa- tion and harmonizing projects. Though consultation among donors is an important part of a successful project,it is not addressed here. Consultation with stakeholders in forest sector projects is not just a requirement\u2014it is a strategic tool. Consultation creates opportunities to identify key issues that, if left unde-tected, can threaten the long-term success of a project. Con-sultation helps project teams, donors, government agencies,and project beneficiaries elaborate on and understand real-ities at the site. Consultations are opportunities for project designers to capture and build upon local knowledge by involving stakeholders in the design of the project. Further- 319 Consultation and Communication in Forest Sector Activities CHAPTER 10more, consultation is a way to ensure that indigenous and other vulnerable groups are involved in projects, and toensure that equity issues are addressed. The complex and multifaceted nature of forest sector projects can make them risky. Forest sector projects often have to address such issues as local access to the resource,the rights of indigenous groups, and other related livelihoodissues. In such cases, consultation offers a means to manage these risks by creating transparency and clearly representingthe approach and objectives of a project. Through properconsultation, stakeholders can be involved in project design,generating local commitment to the process and project.Stakeholders have a means to express concerns construc- tively, and an opportunity to help design solutions (box 10.1). In short, consultation builds a coalition (see box 10.2). The benefits of consultation are not without costs, both human and monetary. Consultation requires trained per-sonnel and takes time. The time and budgetary constraintscan be managed with proper planning. Because the consul-tation process and the project design should be shaped by and respond to stakeholder concerns, the consultationprocess can and should be flexible. The benefits of consulta- tion far outweigh the costs, in spite of the additional plan- ning and accommodation that consultation requires. Consultation with whom? No successful consultation can take place without first identifying key stakeholders. Stakeholders are individuals or groups directly affected,indirectly affected, or with an interest in the project.Though deceptively simple sounding, stakeholder identifi-cation is an essential step, and many long-term problemscan be averted by identifying and including all key groups. Once stakeholders have been identified, the next step is to undertake a stakeholder analysis (see chapter 9, ApplyingForests Policy OP 4.36). This process groups stakeholdersinto categories on the basis of their relationship to the proj-ect (policy makers, potentially adversely affected people,Indigenous Peoples or tribal organizations, donor agencies, 320 CHAPTER 10: CONSULTATION AND COMMUNICATION IN FOREST SECTOR ACTIVITIES \"Strategic communications and civil society consulta- tions can help manage risks.\" \u2014Communications Officer, External Affairs, Communication, and Network Anchor (EXTCN) The Liberia Forest Initiative (LFI) is a partnership of government and international organizations andNGOs to support the rehabilitation and reform ofLiberia's forest sector and enhance cooperation andcoordination of activities in Liberia for the promotionof sustainable forest management. Liberia is a post-conflict nation with many forest resources. These for-est resources are in high demand to serve the nation'seconomic growth through a process that accounts forcommunity rights and equitably addresses distributionand environmental issues. Actions in Liberia are under close scrutiny by national and international groups because there is agreat deal at stake. In the recent past, an internationalNGO wrote a letter to the Forest Development Author-ity (FDA) of Liberia, a member of the LFI, expressingconcern that the draft National Forestry Reform Law of2006 failed \"to adequately address the important issuesof community rights and participation in decisionmaking, forest management, and land tenure.\" The managing director of the FDA prepared a response highlighting how the LFI has helped in mak- ing the process highly consultative. \"We, too, are extremely concerned about these issues, and as a result we have been studying and debating them since thedebut of this legal reform process in 2003... Currently,all actors involved in the forest sector reform processhave been diligently working in a collaborative fashion to achieve this objective, and we strongly believe thatthe content of the draft law provides a far greaterrecognition of community rights and many more for-mal avenues for participation of communities in deci-sion making about the use of Liberia's forest resourcesthan ever encountered in this nation's history.\" Having the structure of the LFI in place allowed the international parties and the government to handlethis situation in a constructive manner that did notescalate or paralyze the project. The framework forconsultation was already in place. The LFI provided aplace for outside parties to express concerns and avenue for response\u2014thus assuaging fears and creatingtransparency. Ultimately, the external party was offeredthe opportunity of continued involvement and wasfolded into the project. Box 10.1 Liberia Forest Initiative: A Strategic Partnership that Enables Consultation Source: Adapted by author.media, NGOs, other interest groups, and so forth) (see box 10.3). For each category of stakeholders, three categories ofinformation should be developed: Defining characteristics, including social dimensions, organizational strength, formal or informal power andauthority, organizational capacity, and so forth. Stake or interest in the project, and the stakeholders' potential support or opposition to the project. This mayinclude degree of commitment to the status quo, open- ness to change, and an assessment of whether the pro- posed project is aligned with the interests of the con-cerned stakeholders. Influence of each stakeholder group, and whether poten- tial opposition from each of them\u2014and the groups col- lectively\u2014constitutes a high, substantial, medium, or low risk to the project outcomes. What is a good consultation process? A good consulta- tion process is one that is carefully planned, with clear goalsand responsibilities agreed to by all institutions involved. The sequence of consultation steps should be well-plannedfrom the beginning; public consultation should begin\u2014where possible\u2014before major decisions are made. Eachstage of the project may require different consultation mea-sures (see table 10.1). The scope of the consultation shouldalso be appropriate to the project. For example, long-termprojects involving diverse stakeholders may require consul-tation processes specific to each stakeholder group andrepeated consultations during the course of the project. Ultimately, a project's success depends on stakeholders understanding the project's purpose and committing to aplan for its success. Appropriate goals will vary by projectand by phase within a project. For example, during the siteselection phase of a protected area establishment, the goalmight be to identify the concerns of local stakeholdergroups regarding potential sites. During the implementa-tion phase, consultation could contribute to identifying potential mitigation approaches to the challenges associatedwith implementation (see table 10.1 for a summary of con-sultation objectives at different project phases). T o ensure positive outcomes, responsibilities must be clearly defined and agreed to by all implementing institu-tions\u2014whether international, national, or local. The con-sultation plan should clearly delineate who is responsiblefor particular monitoring and evaluation exercises, as wellas for specific outputs. T o produce effective results, good consultation requires the provision of adequate resources before embarking on aproject activity. Planning\u2014skills required, scope, and levelof consultation\u2014should fit the budget. Budget constraintscan lead to the temptation to conduct insufficient or cur-sory consultation, but inattention to stakeholder concernscan threaten the success of a project. Furthermore, a successful project is sensitive to local issues. It builds upon existing networks (for instance, donor coordination groups or forest user groups). It identifies latentconflicts and deals with them proactively (see boxes 10.3 and10.4). The consultation process should be designed toaccommodate both national laws and international conven-tions. It should also consider site-specific sensitivities; for example, political and cultural issues like ethnic prejudice orrestrictions on women, as well as geography, can have animpact on the process, so plans must be made accordingly.Values, particularly those of minorities, such as Indigenous Peoples, sometimes conflict with national ones (see box10.5). For example, national desire for foreign exchangefrom timber sales can be at odds with use of forest resourcesfor equitable improvement of local livelihood or sociocultu- CHAPTER 10: CONSULTATION AND COMMUNICATION IN FOREST SECTOR ACTIVITIES 321Meaningful public consultation typically takes place at three different levels: conveying informa-tion to the public, listening to the opinions and preferences of the public, and involving the public in making decisions. The nature and size of theproject, combined with both the nature and num-ber of stakeholders and the status of national leg-islation, will largely define when, where, and what level of public consultation is required for an Envi-ronmental Assessment (EA) and its Environmen-tal Management Plan. For instance, if the aim is to inform the public about a project or important issues, the initialnumber of people to contact will be large, but the interaction may be limited. If public preferences are being sought, closer contact and dialogue willbe required, but with a smaller number of people.If the public's direct input to decision making isbeing sought, ongoing discussions with a smallgroup of representatives of stakeholder groups willlikely be held. Site-specific factors, such as a his-tory of local opposition to similar projects in thearea, will also be important in determining thelevel of consultations.

Where values conflict, the objective of the con- sultation process is for stakeholders to exchange informa-tion and perspectives and identify compromises. Planning tasks. Finally, there are some commonalities for successful consultation. Though every project will be unique in its needs, many (if not all) of these planning taskswill apply 1: Identify stakeholder groups (see above). Identify the key consultation issues. One of the first criti- cal steps is to identify the key issues around which the consultation will be oriented. Environmental and social issues, such as indigenous groups, resettlement, and spir- itual uses of forests, often prove important. Understand the decision-making process. Next, under- standing how environmental decisions are made is essen-tial. Who makes which decisions at what point in the project cycle? Determine the appropriate level of consultation. (See box 10.2.) Consultation can occur at three different levels: conveying information to stakeholders, listening to stakeholder opinions, and involving stakeholders in deci- sion making. How much consultation and at which levelit should occur will depend on the scope and size of theproject. Identify timing for consultation. Consultation before major decisions is essential. Consultation as part of research, planning, and development of mitigation plans is better. For the specific purposes of an EA, consultation is required at a minimum after an EA category has beenassigned, and once a draft EA has been prepared. Choose consultation techniques. In general, it is essential to maintain good communication in consultations. Target 322 CHAPTER 10: CONSULTATION AND COMMUNICATION IN FOREST SECTOR ACTIVITIES \"Listen to your critics and learn from them.\" \u2014Communications Officer, EXTCN Lessons can be drawn regarding the importance of con- sultation and a clear communications strategy from theWorld Bank project in Cambodia on forest concessionmanagement that started in 2000. The project focusedon (i) forest concession planning and inventory, (ii) for- est concession control, (iii) forest crime monitoring andprevention, and (iv) project management and institu-tional strengthening. An inspection panel case on thisproject identified some shortcomings\u2014including over-lapping claims on timber and resin trees, lack of effec-tive concessionaire controls over subcontractors, and restriction of access to livelihood resources\u2014and pro- vided some guidance on how these could have beenaddressed. These lessons are useful for projects withcomplex natural resource management issues. Shared Vision and Engagement with Other Stakeholders In projects that address national resource manage- ment issues, it is important to map stakeholders'varying and, at times, conflicting interests and engage them early and throughout implementation. Advisory groups could be useful for ongoing feed- back and guidance. Interactions with stakeholders should be managedwith great care\u2014ensuring expectations are clear, materials are available early and in an appropriateformat, neutral facilitators are employed if neces-sary, and existing mechanisms such as technicalworking groups are used for ongoing dialogue witha range of stakeholders. Role of Local Communities, Including Consultationswith Affected Communities The World Bank should play a proactive role in encou - raging early and sustained involvement of local com-munities in project design and implementation. Many crucial issues can be more effectivelyaddressed at an earlier stage, thus lowering tensionsand apprehensions on all sides and speeding the process of reform. When project implementation involves community consultation, the World Bank should work with theimplementing agency to ensure appropriate identi- fication of affected communities, the associated area of impact, and appropriate third parties (free fromconflict of interest) to carry out environmental andsocial impact assessments. Mechanisms for monitoring compliance with planned consultation procedures should also beagreed upon in advance, and results of monitoring efforts should be made publicly available.Box 10.3 Consultation in Cambodia: Lessons Learned Source: Adapted from IBRD and IDA 2006.groups must be clearly notified about collaboration opportunities. Extensive records of consultation eventsshould be kept. Feedback should be provided to the pub- lic, clearly explaining project responses to their concerns (see box 10.6) The most effective consultation plan willlikely use a range of listening techniques, a variety ofmethods for involving stakeholders in decision making,as well as several methods of conveying information (see tables 10.2 and 10.3). (For more information about tech-niques, see World Bank 1999). Develop a budget. Consultation is not without costs, and it is important that the consultation budget reflect the size and scope of the consultation plan (see box 10.7). Define a communication methodology (see next section of this chapter). COMMUNICATION Development of a comprehensive communications strategyis essential to the long-term success of a project. Clear com-munications are especially important in challenging gover- nance environments because they create transparency. Con- sistent, open communication is instrumental in developingthe public and political support required for the long-termsuccess of a project. Furthermore, communication is impor-tant in every phase of a successful project: initiating, plan- ning, and presenting results. Communication and consulta-tion are tools that work hand-in-hand to build strong,effective projects\u2014consultation is one form of instigatingcommunication and communication is an important out-come of consultation. Communication is a term that incorporates information dissemination, dialogue, transparency, feedback, responsive-ness, and engagement. Communication requirements can bebroadly classified into external and internal needs. Externalneeds involve engagement with the media, political leaders,and civil society to build trust, credibility, reputation, andsupport for the program. Internal needs involve communi-cation directed at clients, stakeholders, or partners to gener-ate understanding, participation, or ownership of the pro- gram (see box 10.6). Internal and external communicationneeds are mutually reinforcing: transparent, clear, open com-munication will help win political and civil society support,and a broad alliance will help to increase the effectiveness ofa project and its ability to reach stakeholders. What is a good communications strategy? In the inter- est of cohesion and transparency, the entire project team should discuss and eventually agree to the communication plan. The communications strategy should encompass andmaintain oversight of all aspects of communications con-tained in the project\u2014everything from speeches by govern-ment officials, to the information given to local people by local representatives of agencies responsible for investmentin, and operation of, the development program. If this com-prehensive aspect fails, disconnected communications CHAPTER 10: CONSULTATION AND COMMUNICATION IN FOREST SECTOR ACTIVITIES 323\"Planning an effective consultation up front is easier than trying to 'catch up' or fix situations later.\" \u2014Lead Forestry Specialist, Africa Region. Forests are ubiquitous in the Democratic Republic of Congo; they touch the cultural and economic life of mostof the population and have enormous global environ-mental significance. After years of conflicts and misman- agement, reconstruction is critical to improving livingconditions and consolidating peace. At the same time,better roads and trade bring risks\u2014threatening forestsand biodiversity by facilitating logging, land conversion,and the seizure of forest rights by vested interests. Antici-pating these threats, in 2002, the transitional government started a priority reform agenda. This was a politically charged agenda with supporting and opposing views.A recent analysis assessing the soundness of the pri- ority reform agenda provided a vehicle for strengthen- ing the relationship among groups that previously opposed one another. The study involved a consulta- tive process to sharpen the analysis and test consensuson initial conclusions. The process also included con-sultations with government, national and internationalNGOs, industry, forest people, and donors. Field visits and meetings with local groups took place in Septem-ber 2003 in Equateur province, in February 2004 inEastern province, and in December 2005 in NorthKivu. This study also benefited from a number of the-matic workshops and from two International ForestForums held in Kinshasa in November 2004 and Feb- ruary 2006. The overall process improved the working relationship among more than 10 partners.Box 10.4 Consultation in the Democratic Republic of Congo: Using Analytical Work to Start the Process Source: Adapted from Debroux and others 2007.324 CHAPTER 10: CONSULTATION AND COMMUNICATION IN FOREST SECTOR ACTIVITIES \"The underlying issue was not actually the World Bank policy, but rather a local conflict.\" \u2014Retired Senior Social Specialist All over the world, Indigenous Peoples and ethnic minorities have historically been pushed out of fertileflood plains into mountains and interfluvial areas whereforests remain intact. Here they developed balanced and stable adaptations to forest environments, usingresources in a relatively conservative fashion. T oday,roads, globalized markets, and demand for timber, crop,and grazing land have pushed deep into forested areasand threaten the lifestyles of forest dwellers. At the sametime, ethnic minorities\u2014such as the Montagnards of Southeast Asia, the Pygmies of the Democratic Republic of Congo, many Indigenous Peoples of Brazil and theeastern Andes, and the Mayans and other IndigenousPeoples of Mexico and Central America\u2014are undergo-ing economic and political awakening. Internationalinstruments such as the International Labour Organiza-tion Convention 169, the United Nations Declaration onthe Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and the World BankSafeguard Policies, have helped strengthen the rights ofIndigenous Peoples and have created tools they can useto push the envelope with regard to their rights to landand resources. That said, local laws, regulations, andpolitical processes are still the preponderant influences on how well Indigenous Peoples and other minoritiesfare in the defense of territorial and other rights. This picture changes somewhat when a multilateral actor like the World Bank comes on the scene as thefinancier of a development project. World Bank proj-ects in forested areas may have different objectives, butusually they are aimed at raising incomes, helpingsecure land rights, and ensuring sustainable resourceuse. World Bank intervention carries the relatively newinternational charter of indigenous and minorityrights. Indigenous Peoples and the organizations thatsupport them are aware of this and use the policies ofmultinational organizations as leverage in their strug-gles for control over their land and resources. Often,however, the picture is more complex. Local conflictmay not be articulated simply in terms of \"the devel-opers versus the natives.\" Other issues may underlie thecomplaint, such as local political conflicts in the formof electoral politics, and intercommunity, interethnic,and even interpersonal rivalries and conflicts.Indigenous Peoples often claim to occupy a higher moral ground as the primeval defenders of a pristine environment against the depredations of developers. These claims are powerful in national and interna- tional discourse on the use of forests, creating a strongbias in favor of the stands taken by Indigenous Peoples. T o comprehensively address concerns of Indigenous Peoples and preempt any local conflicts that may be manifested as a result of a forest project, it is importantto do the following: Be aware of the geographic and political context of Indigenous Peoples and minorities in areas affected by a project. Pay attention to surrounding areas as well. Be familiar with the legal framework, especially in regard to rights to land and resources and help ensure compliance with these rights. Identify the conflicts that exist in the project area, being familiar with the actors and their politicallinks. Upon becoming aware of a conflict or a potential conflict, be proactive in addressing it, even if it is not directly related to the project. This is theproverbial \"ounce of prevention.\" Consider how the project's interventions may create winners and losers especially with regard to entitle- ments. Does it shift the balance? Try to ensure that all legitimate representatives of Indigenous Peoples are included in consultations; lis- ten for sometimes poorly articulated demands and complaints, even if they do not appear to be related to the project. Keep in mind that \"legitimacy\" is aslippery concept and the task managers and theircounterparts may not be the best judges of wholegitimately speaks for a given group or faction. Avoid consultants who give broad legal and historical surveys and descriptive ethnographic tours but fail to describe the dynamics of what is happening on the ground. Read the consultant's report, question him or her closely, and insist on a full account of conflicts that may be occurring or may be latent. Seek the right balance between people-oriented andecosystem-oriented solutions. Write it all down; capture the above points in the Project Appraisal Document and safeguard compli-ance documents.Box 10.5 Guidance for Addressing Concerns of Indigenous Peoples and Preempting Local Conflicts Source: Gross 2007 (Daniel), consultant and former World Bank social safeguards specialist.activities will, at best, fail to be of the highest possible qual- ity and, at worst, cause confusion or mixed messages, under-mining the effectiveness of the communications strategy (see World Bank 2005). A successful communications strategy is based on research. As a first step, a team should undertake a compre- hensive review of communications lessons learned fromother programs in the country, as well as from relevant nat- ural resource management projects in other countries.Information about stakeholder knowledge, attitudes, andpractices informs the formulation of an effective communi-cations plan. Further information about the link betweencommunications, political analysis, and operational deci- sions is important to ensure that communication is a two- way street. Furthermore, expertise of outside consultantsmay be required when communications needs extendbeyond skills available in-house (for example, reachinginternational mass media outlets, or generating videofootage). Finally, an ideal communications strategy is devel-oped in collaboration with stakeholders, perhaps through aworkshop in which researchers summarize findings andstakeholders help to determine how to communicate them. Though every project will be unique in its needs, a com- munications strategy and work plan comprises these plan-ning tasks: CHAPTER 10: CONSULTATION AND COMMUNICATION IN FOREST SECTOR ACTIVITIES 325Communications methods should be transparent and open to review. Some general principles for achievingtransparency and openness include notification, record keeping, and feedback. Notification. The target groups must be notified how, when, and where they can participate. In general, effective notification is highly visible to the target audi- ence, delivered early, uses more than one medium toreach the target groups, and is repeated shortly beforemajor events. Record keeping. A record of the types of consultation activities held, the target groups and numbers reached, the information conveyed, and the stage at which theinformation was provided should be kept and analyzedto revealsummaries of views by type of stakeholder; a summary of points of agreement, disagreement, issues raised, and options discussed; analysis of the validity of the concerns and issuesraised by different stakeholders; recommended responses to valid comments; and discussion of the implications and options for deci-sion makers. Feedback. Feedback should be provided to the public, clearly explaining the responses to their concerns, describing the decisions made, why they were made,and how the information they provided was used. Oth-erwise, participants may feel that their input had no impact on the decision; some of the benefits of theprocess may be lost, and effective consultation maybecome more difficult in the future.Box 10.6 Elements of Communication and Collaboration Source: World Bank 1999. Providing adequate resources for a successful con- sultation depends on the complexity of the proj-ect, the diversity of the stakeholders, and the importance of the effects, as well as such con- straints as the availability of skilled practitioners,availability of funds, and project deadlines. Theprincipal cost elements vary widely according tothe context of the project, but are likely to include some of the following: consultants' fees hiring and outfitting of meeting venues Public opinion surveys preparation and distribution of materials staff time preparing, attending, and keeping records of public meetings maintenance of channels of communication(telephone hotline, radio announcements, orother means) travel expenses Source: World Bank 1999. Box 10.7 Budgetary Issues: Cost Elements of Consultation Identify goals. This component should detail issues to be addressed and desired outcomes, as well as the feasibility of those goals. Goals will vary with the scope, size, and phase of projects. Assess target audience. What motivates them? What are their needs? What are their stakes in the project? This component has obvious overlap with consultation and the results of stakeholder analysis (see consultation sec- tion above). Develop key messages. - The content will be based on previously identified issues and desired outcomes. - The scope and timing for the plan will depend on the scale and phase of the project (for worksheets helpful for developing timelines for communication projects,see Module 9 of the World Bank's Strategic Communi- cation for Development Projects [Caba\u00f1ero-Verzosa 2003]).Define roles and accountability. Clearly establish divisions of responsibility for which tasks will be handled by which agency (see annex 10A to this chapter for a checklist). This may entail an assessment of client capacity for com- munications tasks and opportunities for capacity build-ing. Specific areas of assessment might include commu-nications planning and management, research,communications material development and production, monitoring and evaluation, liaison work with massmedia, and liaison work with large-scale outreach net-works. (See Caba\u00f1ero-Verzosa 2003 for guide questionsto assess capacity [module 7] and for amodel TOR [module 4].) Identify allies, barriers, options, and possible risks. This identification could potentially be accomplished with communications planning workshops with stakeholders, using participatory methods.

The most effec- tive mode of information delivery may vary from place to place. For example, one project used differentstrategies to reach male and female stakeholders in Mali. Another broadcast information from a speakeron a moped in Bangladesh\u2014a method that provedmore effective than conventional media (see table10.4). - In the interest of transparency and effective external communication about the project, a plan shouldinclude mechanisms, like press briefings, for proactive disclosure of project details and policies to identify and correct misperceptions (see box 10.8). - Assess availability of resources and other arrangements, including specialist advice and authority. Create a communications implementation plan. The implementation plan should detail specific events, mea- sures for monitoring and evaluation, indicators, andpotentially a training scheme and capacity-building component, as well as a budget and time line (see box10.9). (For examples of communications plan budgets,see Module 10 of Caba\u00f1ero-Verzosa (2003)). Plans shouldinclude feedback mechanisms for monitoring effective-ness of communications and adjusting as needed. (Forindicators, see Module 3 of Caba\u00f1ero-Verzosa (2003)).The proposed plan should be assessed to determinewhether it is appropriate to the stated goals and whetherit is feasible, given staffing, funding, and time. Supervision during implementation. Supervision should assess effectiveness, ensure adequate monitoring of inputs and outcomes, make corrective changes, and allow the plan to adapt to changing conditions. The supervi- sion should involve experts and stakeholders. Key ques-tions to be considered include the following: Are com-munications activities taking place? Are materials andmessages reaching the target audience? Are they having the desired effect? Evaluation. An evaluation should address accomplish- ments, lessons learned, future improvements, and should evaluate and monitor results.

This accessible information facilitates two-way communication and empowers local people,the media, parliament, and civil society to be activelyengaged in the process and to provide feedback. T o this end, it is essential that a project have a clear, proactive communications strategy. Lessons learned inthe World Bank project in Cambodia on forest con- cession management that started in 2000 (see box 10.3 for project details) provide important conclusionsabout development of a proactive communicationsstrategy:Clear, consistent communications are essential in challenging governance environments. T eams should first clarify the formal links amongcommunications, political analysis, and operationaldecisions to ensure external information and ques- tions are fed back into operational decision making. The communications strategy should be discussed and endorsed by the entire project team\u2014andshared with the larger country team. The strategy should include a proactive disclosurepolicy (including press briefings at agreed inter-vals), mechanisms to promptly identify and correct errors and misperceptions, and plans and resources to translate information into local languages anddisseminate it through a variety of media. Involvement of communications specialists in proj- ect design and implementation will help to ensureeffective engagement. Box 10.8 Managing Risks through Strategic Communication: The Case of Cambodia Source: Adapted from World Bank 2006. The following are elements within a communicationsimplementation plan: A strategic approach defines (i) the goal(s) identified as feasible and effective in supporting the project'spurpose, (ii) the type of response desired, (iii) the target audiences, and (iv) methods (print, mass media, group encounters, interpersonal communi-cations) that will be used. A training scheme in skills needed to carry out com- munications activities is critical to the strategy. Monitoring and evaluation activities are designed for continuous monitoring of communications strat- egy and activities to provide timely information to improve judgments about action.The capacity-building component is a plan to provide the infrastructure, staffing, and training on commu- nications strategy development and management. It may investigate organizational systems, work perfor- mance indicators, and staff development opportuni-ties that affect the quality of communications work. Budget line items for critical elements that affect the success of communications activities are needed, including the funding of communications research during the planning phase, as well as adequate funding for mass media dissemination costs andgroup communications activities. Timelines that allow for a participatory process of planning, implementing, and monitoring commu- nications activities are necessary.

World Bank,Washington, DC. 334 CHAPTER 10: CONSULTATION AND COMMUNICATION IN FOREST SECTOR ACTIVITIES Paralleling the growing demand for wood products is the growing demand for the verification of the sus-tainability of the forest management from which those products are derived. With the introduction of the World Bank's Operational Policy on Forests in 2002 (OP4.36), the World Bank made its support for commercial har-vesting contingent on certificat ion of operations under an acceptable system, with the exception of small-scale land- holders and operations under community forest manage-ment and joint forest management. Alternatively, supportcan be provided under the condition of adherence to a time-bound action plan to pursue certification under an accept-able system within a certain time frame. Consequently, assessment of certification systems against World Bank requirements is a necessary step in the project appraisalprocess for this kind of investment. Assessment of certifica-tion systems for compliance with these Bank provisionsrequires an in-depth analysis of the standards and appliedprocedures. In this chapter the available instruments for the assess- ment of certification systems and the lessons learned so farare described, and the application of time-bound actionplans for certification are given consideration. A descriptionof the elements that should be included in the terms of ref-erence (TOR) for the assessment of systems and in the design and evaluation of time-bound action plans are provided inthe annexes. This chapter is relevant for other notes in thissourcebook on the identification of high conservation valueforests (note 3.1, Mainstreaming Conservation Considera-tions into Productive Landscapes), which, in some certifica- tion systems, forms part of forest certification assessments;and that on plantations (note 3.3, Forest Plantations), as for- est certification continues to expand its work to include this sector. THE WORLD BANK-WORLD WILDLIFE FUND (WWF) FOREST CERTIFICATION ASSESSMENT GUIDE (FCAG): PURPOSE AND CONCEPT Through an intensive process involving experts in this field and external stakeholders, and in close collaboration withthe WWF, the World Bank developed an assessment frame- work for certification systems that includes elements deemed essential for reliable and independent certificationof forest management. It allows for the evaluation of a sys-tem's compliance with the World Bank's principles, and cancontribute to decisions about whether the system is accept- able in the context of Bank investments. This section will examine the purpose of this initiative. Additional information on the background and the reason-ing behind specific criteria may be obtained from the origi-nal document (World Bank-WWF Alliance 2006). The World Bank-WWF guide for the assessment of for- est certification systems was originally conceived to evaluateprogress toward achieving the World Bank-WWF Alliancegoal of having 200 million hec tares of forests independently certified under an acceptable system by 2005. In addition tothis, other useful functions of the guide include 335 Forest Certification Assessment Guide: Summary on UseCHAPTER 11assisting WWF and the World Bank in providing guid- ance for the development of national standards andadvice to governments and companies; serving as a diagnostic tool for WWF and the WorldBank to identify and target capacity-building efforts tostrengthen certification systems; and assisting the World Bank in the assessment of forest har-vesting operations receiving World Bank investment sup-port under its forests policies. As a result of these different objectives and the different processes chosen for the development of the underlying principles, the elements of the guide are not entirely alignedwith the principles for acceptable certification systems as defined in the OP 4.36 (World Bank 2004). The conse-quences of this for using the tool in the context of WorldBank evaluations are further analyzed below. In general, certification systems consist of three main components: standard setting, conformity assessment (including certification), and accreditation. 1In most cases, they also encompass provisions for claims that can be made by certified operations. Specific rules guiding the work of the related bodies are available from the International Orga- nization for Standardization (ISO) (ISO guides 62, 65, or 66for certification; ISO standard 17011 for accreditation; andISO guide 59 for standardization) (ISO/IEC 1994, 1996a,1996b, 1996c, 2004). Further guidance is provided by the International Social and Environmental Accreditation andLabelling (ISEAL; http://www.isealalliance.org) alliance forstandard-setting processes in the field of social and environ-mental standards (ISEAL Alliance 2004). The latter alsotakes into account relevant World Trade Organization agreements for avoiding trade barriers through standardiza- tion (WTO n.d.). The basic provisions set in these interna-tional standards provide an internationally agreed uponframework for the main operations of a certification system.They summarize the best available knowledge on the neces-sary procedures for conducting independent and reliablecertification and standard setting. Hence, adherence to theserules is defined in the guide as a necessary prerequisite foracceptable certification. The conformity of operations to the rules defined in international norms and standards is monitored in the caseof standard-setting and accreditation bodies by international umbrella organizations through their membership require-ments. If bodies for standard setting and accreditation oper-ating under the assessed certification systems are members ofthese organizations\u2014ISEAL Alliance, International Accredi-tation Forum, or the United Nations' Investment AdvisoryFacility (UNIAF)\u2014they are subject to control for compli- ance with international norms and standards. In this case itcan be assumed, based on evaluation and monitoring carriedout by these organizations, that compliance with ISO andISEAL standards is achieved and maintained over time. Theassessment process should emphasize the actual scope of themonitoring procedures of international umbrella organiza-tions, and whether the forest certification activities of stan-dard-setting and accreditation bodies are actually covered.The operations of certification bodies are monitored by theirrespective accreditation bodies. Again, evaluation and subse-quent surveillance of certification bodies has to be carriedout to determine the body's performance specifically within the field of assessing forest management. In the absence of appropriate surveillance mechanisms, the requirements defined in the guide have to be verified ina stand-alone evaluation of the standard-setting and accred-itation bodies. Although the above-mentioned international norms and standards provide a framework applicable to a wide range of sectors, they are insufficient to address the more complexsocial and environmental issues involved in forest manage- ment certification. Additional elements have been definedin the guide that deal with the content of standards and thestandards-development process, as well as with guidance toassess, among other elements, the level of transparency and reliability achieved by each system's accreditation and certi-fication operations. USING THE GUIDE FOR WORLD BANK ASSESSMENTS OF CERTIFICATION SYSTEMS This chapter describes how conformance with World Bank principles can be analyzed using either guidance included ininternational framework standards, such as ISO guides and the ISEAL Alliance Code of Good Practice, or the additional requirements in the World Bank-WWF guide. The chapteralso presents elements that are not included in the WorldBank-WWF guide, but are relevant to assessing complianceof certification systems with the World Bank's policy. It is understood that the guide developed by the WorldBank-WWF Alliance is suitable as an interpretation of therespective provisions in Bank policy, but should not beapplied as a normative document because, for the purposeof World Bank project preparation, the rules in the policy prevail. Independence, avoidance of conflict of interests, and third-party certification. Independence of the operations 336 CHAPTER 11: FOREST CERTIFICATION ASSESSMENT GUIDE: SUMMARY ON USEcarried out under a specific certification system is a key aspect of the World Bank approach to certification, and relatedrequirements appear repeatedly in the policy. Consequently, personnel involved in audits and decision making have to be selected to avoid former or current relations with the candi-date for certification or accreditation, which may influencejudgment. It follows from these requirements that only third-party certification can be accepted because self-certification or certification among business partners cannot be consideredindependent. The same applies for the relationship betweenthe certification body and the accreditation organization,which has to be designed to avoid undue influence on the out-come of the accreditation process. Because independence is a fundamental principle com- prehensively dealt with in all ISO guides and standards, it isnot necessary to define additional criteria. According to ISOguidance, certification and accreditation bodies have toensure that financial or commercial interests are not influ-encing operations and decisions. T o this end, the certifica-tion body and all personnel involved in auditing or certifi-cation decisions, as well as senior executive staff responsiblefor finances, supervision, and policy implementation, mustbe free of any undue commercial or financial influence onits decisions. This also includes proving financial stability ofthe operation. Furthermore, auditing personnel are not per- mitted to be involved in certification decision making, andcertification or accreditation bodies are prohibited fromproviding consultancy services to assessed operations. Atthe personnel level, conflicts of interest must be declaredand bodies must exclude those with former or actual rela-tions with the operation under assessment. Although sub-contracting is generally permitted, it is limited to auditingtasks and subject to the same independence and impartial-ity requirements. Transparency of certification decisions. According to World Bank policy, an acceptable certification system must have transparent decision-making procedures. Require-ments in the ISO and ISEAL guidance documents make itmandatory to publish basic information on the applied pro-cedures, such as the processes applied for standard setting,certification or accreditation, the complaints and appealsmechanisms, and the evaluation and assessment proce-dures. In addition, standard-setting bodies have to maketheir work plan publicly available, produce a written synop-sis of the comments received during the standard-settingprocess, and state how comments were addressed in thestandard. For certification and accreditation bodies, it isobligatory to publish the results of the certification process,normally through a publicly available list of the certificate holders or the accredited certification bodies, respectively.Proven compliance with these ISO and ISEAL rules there- fore provides basic information about the conformance of a certification system with the World Bank's transparencyrequirement. In addition, transparency demands that stakeholders external to the process be able to understand the rationale for the decisions made by certification, accreditation, orstandard-setting bodies. The World Bank-WWF AllianceForest Certification Assessment Guide therefore includesrules concerning publication of reports on evaluations andrelated decisions on certification and accreditation. Fairness of certification decisions. World Bank policy requires the decision-making procedures of a certification system to be fair. For standard-setting procedures, this canbe achieved through balanced voting procedures, furtheroutlined below. The most frequent cause for an unfair deci-sion in certification or accreditation is granting or main-taining certified or accredited status where the operationdoes not comply with the standard. This is unfair to othercertified or accredited operations that fully comply with thestandard. However, all rules for independence, reliability,and credibility guiding certification were developed with the intent to avoid such incidences. Certification systemsthat follow ISO rules and comply with additional require-ments described in the World Bank-WWF guide can beregarded as in conformity with the fairness requirementincluded in the World Bank policy. Participation in standards development. Based on its overall principles on participation, the World Bank empha- sizes in its policy the need for involvement of a wide rangeof stakeholders and interest groups in the standards-devel-opment process. According to the World Bank, the stan-dards should be \"developed with the meaningful participa-tion of local people and communities; indigenous peoples;non-governmental organizations representing consumer,producer, and conservation interests; and other members ofcivil society including the private sector\" (World Bank2004). Identification of relevant stakeholders and proactivemeasures to engage interested parties in the process beforecommencement of standard-setting activities are basicrequirements in the ISEAL code. The provisions alsoencompass other elements for broad stakeholder involve-ment, including the publication of draft standards, specifi-cation of an appropriate period for receiving comments, aswell as procedures for handling comments received. The CHAPTER 11: FOREST CERTIFICATION ASSESSMENT GUIDE: SUMMARY ON USE 337ISEAL code also requires that an appropriate dispute reso- lution mechanism be in place. While compliance with ISEAL ensures that basic provi- sions for stakeholder involvement are being followed, addi- tional aspects should be evaluated to verify that the deci-sion-making process allows for balanced participation ofeconomic, social, and environmental interests. The WorldBank-WWF guide describes voting procedures that should be applied when consensus cannot be reached so that a sin-gle interest group does not dominate the process. In addition, the World Bank requires the meaningful participation of local people and communities. Becausemost standard-setting processes in the forest sector have a national-level focus, it is difficult to adequately address the representation of often widely differing local interests.Therefore, the system should have mechanisms that require,at a minimum, a standard be field tested in close consulta-tion with adjacent people and communities before endorse-ment. Attributes of forest management standards. Stan- dards are a basic element of certification systems because they describe the performance level that certified operationshave to achieve, and provide the basis for the communica-tion of these achievements. OP 4.36 lists in paragraph 10 the general principles that have to be covered by the stan-dard, and, in addition, requires \"objective and measurableperformance standards that are defined at the national leveland are compatible with internationally accepted principlesand criteria of sustainable forest management.\" The contentof a system's standards can be analyzed using provisions inthe World Bank-WWF guide because compliance withrequirements in the guide encompasses conformance withthe World Bank's principles for forest management. The provisions for the content of standards are set at a rather general level of overall principles of forest manage-ment. Therefore, the World Bank-WWF guide requires thedevelopment of more detailed indicators during their adap-tation to national or regional circumstances. These indica-tors have to describe the performance level for each crite-rion, as highlighted in paragraph 11 of the World Bank'spolicy, and be measurable and objective. T o avoid trade distortions, national standards have to be based on a set of internationally applicable principles. TheWorld Bank-WWF guide therefore includes the need fornational standard-setting bodies to seek harmonization ofnational standards with those of neighboring countries, andto introduce an endorsement mechanism at the interna-tional level for the approval of national standards. Cost-effectiveness. International norms and standards in the ISO or ISEAL frameworks for certification systems do not include specific rules guiding the economic performance of the operations and processes involved in the certification process, as required in OP 4.36. On the other hand, it is abasic condition for certification operations that costs arecovered at all levels by their economic activities; otherwise,the systems would not be economically viable. Furthermore, it can be assumed that businesses in the sector will only par-ticipate in a certification system when either their monetaryor nonmonetary benefits from the system outweigh the costsincurred to achieve certification or accreditation. It is important to ensure that certification systems do not discriminate against operations according to their size, location, or forest type, particularly in terms of cost-effectiveness\u2014that is, a cert ification system should not be so expensive that a small company automatically does notqualify. Most international systems extended their servicesto provide a global reach and are indifferent to location orforest type. However, it has proven to be difficult to makecertification attractive to small landholders because ofexcessive per-hectare costs. Given the current trend ofrapidly increasing the forest area under management bycommunities and smaller operations that are directly orindirectly supported by the donor community (including the World Bank), and the importance of these types of for-est owners as custodians of the forest in many countries, itis of particular concern when certification systems are notaccessible to these groups because of the size of their opera-tions. Although economic efficiency implies that costs arecovered by the beneficiaries of the system, it is particularlyimportant for the World Bank that certification systemshave procedures to ensure cost-effectiveness for thesegroups and facilitate their access to services. This can beachieved by reducing the intensity of evaluations for these groups or by waiving certain cost-intensive require-ments, such as planning and documentation or landscape-level objectives mainly applicable to larger operations. 2 Corresponding requirements are included in the World Bank-WWF guide. ASSESSING CERTIFICATION SYSTEMS This section describes the limitations of the assessments car-ried out using the tools mentioned in the previous sectionand the lessons learned during the process of developing the World Bank-WWF guide (see annex 11A to this chapter for guidance on TORs). The Bank has yet to initiate a projectthat has required assessment of certification systems, but 338 CHAPTER 11: FOREST CERTIFICATION ASSESSMENT GUIDE: SUMMARY ON USEonce more practical experience has been achieved through the application of the guide, it will be incorporated. Certification systems are institutionally and organiza- tionally complex, and their assessment requires consider- able professional knowledge of forest certification, coupledwith a profound understanding of international frameworkrules and insight into the specific roles of the different sys-tem elements and their interactions. While the elements outlined above should be examined when considering certification systems, it is likely that at present no system is in full conformity with all require-ments. Assessment of schemes as a first step will highlightstrengths and weaknesses and deliver general information on the performance of each. Nonetheless, decisions regard- ing whether a certification system is consistent with WorldBank policies should consider the impacts of the identifieddeficits in the particular country or project situation. Although it is desirable to assess a system's actual perfor- mance, it is not always possible because internal proceduresof bodies are, with certain exceptions, normally kept confi-dential, and operations can deny access to auditors outsidethe regular monitoring and surveillance structures. Thismakes analysis of the organizations difficult, and may pre-clude methodologically consistent and reliable assessmentsof the system's performance. In many cases, assessments must therefore rely on existing mechanisms provided byinternational organizations overseeing standard setting oraccreditation, such as the International AccreditationForum or the ISEAL Alliance. Elucidation of the World Bank principles for forest man- agement standards through development of indicators mayat least partly overlap with provisions for Bank investmentsin the sector, which are included in other Bank policies (forexample, OP 4.04 Natural Habitats, OP 4.10 IndigenousPeoples, or OP 4.09 Pest Management). However, the rulesoutlined in these policies are specifically tailored to theneeds of World Bank project preparation and surveillance,and, as such, are not necessarily part of standards andrelated monitoring procedures of certification systems.Decisions on the acceptability of certification systemsshould therefore primarily be based on elements included inparagraph 10 of OP 4.36. PROVIDING SUPPORT BEFORE CERTIFICATION USING TIME-BOUND ACTION PLANS So far, performance of many forest management operations in World Bank client countries lags behind the level speci-fied by the standards of certification systems that can com-ply with the Bank's provisions and be deemed acceptable in the context of OP 4.36 (see annex 11B to this chapter forguidance on TOR). It is therefore likely that the alternativeprovided by the policy\u2014to support operations on the con-dition of adherence to an acceptable time-bound actionplan\u2014will be used frequently. Measures included in thisplan should be adequate to achieve certification under a sys-tem acceptable to the World Bank. Thus, the first step indeveloping a plan for improvement is the selection of a cer-tification system accepted by both the World Bank and theclient. Identification of areas of nonconformance with the stan- dard is part of the assessment work carried out by certifica-tion bodies operating under the selected system. In situa-tions in which the operation is unlikely to achieve fullcompliance with the standard, the certification body shouldcarry out a preassessment of the operation and provide a listof issues that need further improvement. Measures to over-come these deficits can be derived from this informationeither by the operation, the certification body, or throughother external advice. In addition, the time frame set forachieving full certification should be realistic. The World Bank should refrain from supporting the operation if it isunlikely that full certification can be reached within theduration of the project. T o determine the feasibility of the action plan, the actual available capacity to implement the measures proposedwithin the specified time frame needs to be assessed. T o thisend, the World Bank should carry out an assessment of costsresulting from the implementation of measures in relation tothe overall financial situation of the applicant operation, tak- ing into account, if available, information on potential ben-efits through better market access or price premiums result-ing from certified status. This analysis should also considerfunds provided through the envisaged World Bank support. Human resources available to the operation\u2014numbers of staff and qualifications\u2014are another critical aspect for itscapacity to implement the measures defined in the actionplan. Hence, evaluation of the overall capacity available tothe applicant, and its adequacy for implementation of the action plan, forms another important component of theproject planning phase. Experience has shown that the com-mitment of the owner and senior management to certifica-tion is an important success factor. Although this may bedifficult to evaluate, the interim steps taken by the company to pursue certifiable forest management may indicate thesincerity of their intentions. Depending on the nature and duration of implementa- tion, it can be desirable not only to define the overall target, CHAPTER 11: FOREST CERTIFICATION ASSESSMENT GUIDE: SUMMARY ON USE 339but also to consider intermediary phases using a step-wise approach. Progress could then be monitored against previ-ously agreed upon milestones. NOTES 1. Standard setting: The process by which a standard for forest management is developed.

In its global strategy on forests, the World Bank recognizes the integration of forests into sustainable economic development as one major pillar of its invest- ments in the sector, including enabling or directly support- ing commercial use of the forest. At the same time, theWorld Bank must limit negative social or environmentalimpacts of forest use by setting preconditions for support-ing commercial operations in the forest. The policy frame- work laid out in OP 4.36 stipulates that in order to receiveBank support, commercial harvesting of forests carried outon an industrial scale must be certified by a system deemedacceptable by the World Bank. The forest management standards required by such systems and their operational procedures must conform tothe elements further specified in paragraphs 10 and 11 ofOP 4.36. The World Bank, in close collaboration with theWWF, developed an assessment guide that details the prin-ciples of the policy (World Bank-WWF 2006) and providesa framework to assess the quality of certifications systems.This instrument is recognized as the basis for the assessmentof certification systems according to World Bank require-ments. The TOR listed in this document summarize the key steps in assessments carried out according to the WorldBank-WWF guide on assessing certification systems. The assessment will provide information on the performancelevel achieved by certification systems in relation to WorldBank principles and identify the gaps that may still exist inthe system's standard requirements of operational proce-dures. This analysis can support decisions regarding theacceptability of systems, but further judgment will need tobe exercised when certification systems do not fully complywith all requirements, and consideration be given to thepotential impacts that may result from these deficits in aparticular project environment. Tasks. Different tasks can be performed depending on the background of the assessment. The issues listed under the firstthree tasks can be carried out in a stand-alone assessment thatdoes not require a decision on the acceptability of systems.The fourth and fifth tasks are recommended if the assessmentis to provide the basis for investment decisions under OP 4.36and in cases where the assessment showed deficits in the sys-tem's standards or procedures. The consultant shall perform the following tasks: 1. Analyze the respective certification system for its conformance with the OP 4.36 requirements using theWorld Bank-WWF guide as a reference document. This should include direct consultations with certificationsystems personnel on draft findings. 2. On the basis of this assessment, compile a list of required elements with which the system is not in compliance. 3. Compile a list of those elements for which an assessment was not possible due to a lack of information or lack of access to procedures or operations of certification, accreditation, or standard-setting bodies working underthe system. 4. Analyze the identified deficits in the context of the over- all project environment and conduct a risk assessmenton the potential negative impacts of the identified deficits. This exercise can be supplemented by consulta- tions with relevant stakeholders in the World Bank clientcountry. 5. On the basis of the findings, produce a substantiated judgment on whether the system meets OP 4.36 require-ments and can provide sufficient assurance that certifi-cate holders fully comply with the World Bank's require-ments for forest management certification listed inparagraph 10 of OP 4.36. Qualifications. The qualifications necessary for assessing the elements of a certification system may, in many cases, require the employment of an audit team rather than a sin-gle auditor. The assessor or the assessment team should havethe following qualifications: practical experience and knowledge in forest certification profound understanding of the different elements of sys- tems for accreditation, certification, and standard set-ting, and their various interactions broad knowledge of ISO guides 62, 65, and 66; ISO stan-dard 17011; and practical experience in assessing bodiesagainst the requirements set in these norms advanced degree in forest resource management orrelated field no conflicts of interest with regard to the certificationsystem under assessment For a judgment on the impacts of identified system deficits, the consultant(s) should have in-depth knowledge of the overall economic, ecological, and social environment, and the country's legal and pol-icy context; and CHAPTER 11: FOREST CERTIFICATION ASSESSMENT GUIDE: SUMMARY ON USE 341ANNEX 11A MODEL TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR ASSESSMENT OF CERTIFICATION SYSTEMSthe ability to analyze certification systems and their impact in a given environment.

Washington, DC: World Bank-WWF Alliance. 342 CHAPTER 11: FOREST CERTIFICATION ASSESSMENT GUIDE: SUMMARY ON USEBackground. The World Bank supports investments in the forest sector under OP 4.36. T o qualify for this support, operations involving commercial forest harvesting on an industrial scale must achieve certification under a system acceptable to the World Bank. Alternatively, operations canqualify by adhering to a time-bound action plan that is ade-quate to achieve certification within a specified time frame. Preparation of investments in this area should therefore include the following steps: selection of a certification system assessment of the performance of the operation in rela- tion to the forest management standard elaboration of a time-bound action plan assessment of the plan's acceptability under World Bankterms monitoring of the implementation of the plan Each of these individual steps is associated with different responsibilities, tasks, issues to consider, qualifications required, and actors involved, which are outlined below. Selection of a certification system. Selection of a cer- tification system that conforms with World Bank require- ments and is operational in the country of the applicant is aprecondition for assessing the performance of the opera-tion. Details describing the World Bank's approach to selec-tion of certification systems are given in this chapter of thesourcebook. The decision has to be made by the applicant,but preferably in close collaboration with the World Bank'scontact person for the project, normally the task team leader. T o prepare for the selection, the consultant will do the following: Identify the forest management certification systems that are operational in the country of the applicant. Assess the systems against World Bank requirements in accordance with the World Bank's instruments for assess-ment of forest certification schemes (annex 11A). The consultant should draw upon the results of assessments conducted for similar projects in the country, or previousassessments commissioned by other bodies, if available. If the certification systems are not entirely in compliance with World Bank requirements, the consultant will pro-vide the World Bank with a list of deficits, together with a substantiated judgment regarding risks that couldpotentially emerge for the project because of the identi- fied system's deficiencies. Assessment of the applicant operation. The assess- ment should highlight the strengths and weaknesses of theapplicant in relation to the forest management standard ofthe certification system. Because the tasks involved are sim-ilar to those performed during normal audits, the assess-ment should be conducted by a team that is familiar withthe regular audit procedures of the system and be selectedaccording to the same criteria applied by the respective cer-tification system. It is essential that team members have suf-ficient competence and local knowledge to analyze the legalframework, the ecological and social aspects of forest man-agement, and its broader impact on the well-being of adja-cent communities. During such a preassessment for certifi-cation, the consultant(s) will perform the following tasks: Assess the applicant's forest management practices for compliance with each element of the selected certifica-tion system's standards. Compile a list of issues where the company's perfor-mance falls below the requirements of the standard. If applicable to the selected certification system, groupthe deficits into minor noncompliance issues that couldbe resolved after certification has been awarded, and major noncompliance issues that would prevent the operation from obtaining immediate certification. Highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the operation. Identify appropriate measures to improve forest manage- ment to the level required for full certification. Development of the time-bound action plan. On the basis of the identified deficits, the company should develop a plan detailing actions envisaged for improvement.Although external consultants can assist in this step, seniorstaff should play a leading role in this process to ensure a close connection between the company and the action plan. Depending on the situation, it may be necessary to intro- duce a step-wise approach by defining interim performancelevels to be achieved. This approach may be necessarydepending on, among other issues, the previous record of the company applying for assistance, the commitment of senior management or the owner to implementation of theaction plan, the time frame set for full compliance in rela-tion to the duration of the project, as well as the gravity and CHAPTER 11: FOREST CERTIFICATION ASSESSMENT GUIDE: SUMMARY ON USE 343ANNEX 11B PROCEDURES AND TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF A TIME-BOUND ACTION PLAN FOR CERTIFICATIONnumber of identified instances of noncompliance with the standard. In this step, the applicant will develop a time-bound action plan with the following elements: The list of deficits identified as being impediments toimmediate certification (also referred to as precondi-tions). The measures proposed by the company to overcome thedeficits and to achieve certification in the specified timeframe. The measures should be suitable to address the identified deficits and consider the overall legal, political, and economic situation of the company, and feasiblegiven the means available to the operation. The descrip-tion should avoid the use of ambiguous terms. Each proposed action should be accompanied by an esti- mate of the time required for implementation and theexpected time for achieving the performance level pre- scribed by the standard. The time frame should be real- istically set given the overall resources of the operationand the commitment expressed by the management orthe owner (see below). The plan should include a summary of the resources avail- able to the company presented as the number and quali-fications of personnel. In addition, the financial means dedicated by the operation to the implementation of the proposed actions should be described and analyzed. The plan should be accompanied by a clear statement from the executive director of the operation or the ownerto accept and adhere to the measures defined. If a step-wise approach is considered necessary, the planshould define individual steps, including the achieve-ments to be reached within a specified time frame. Assessment of the plan for acceptability under World Bank terms. According to OP 4.36, the action plan has to be evaluated to determine its acceptability. Although the WorldBank's policy does not provide further detail regarding what should be covered by the action plan, the elements listed inthe previous section can provide a framework to apply on acase-by-case basis. The assessment must consider the plan'ssuitability, adequacy, and feasibility for implementing theproposed measures within the set time frame. T o ensure inde- pendence and avoid conflicts of interest, the persons involved in the previous steps should not take part in this evaluation. Monitoring of implementation. The monitoring proce- dures applied to the implementation of the plan can be sim-ilar to the World Bank's normal mechanisms for project sur- veillance. The preparation of the time-bound action planalready describes the necessary elements for monitoring,such as the deadlines and achievements required, and thenecessary resources. In addition, the monitoring scheduleand intensity should reflect the level of risk involved with the project. Risk factors may include, but are not limited to,the potential impact on critical forests or critical naturalhabitats, the overall economic situation of the operation, and the effects of the project on adjacent communities orIndigenous Peoples. When a risk analysis shows that theimpacts of the project are considerable, sanctions for non-conformance with the set deadlines should be incorporatedinto the loan agreement. T o comply with the standards of a certification system deemed acceptable to the World Bank, the operation has todevelop its own monitoring procedures, through whichinformation on key forest parameters is collected and ana-lyzed (see also OP 4.36, paragraph 10[h]). In general, inter-nal monitoring of certified operations provides informationon the resource base (harvest rates, growth, and regenera-tion), status and changes of flora and fauna, and economicparameters, such as cost and efficiency. Consequently, anassessment of these procedures has to be carried out against the certification standard during the preassessment of theoperation. For tailoring its own monitoring program, theWorld Bank can take into account the results from the pre-assessment under point 2 concerning the quality of thecompany's monitoring program. The World Bank's own monitoring can be limited to aspects insufficiently coveredby these mechanisms.

CHAPTER 11: FOREST CERTIFICATION ASSESSMENT GUIDE: SUMMARY ON USE 345Several World Bank safeguard policies emphasize that local sites may have special value, in particular forthose who depend on them for their livelihood or their social, spiritual and cultural well-being. Operational Policy on Forests (OP 4.36) recognizes that many local com-munities depend entirely or primarily on forests and forestproducts and that these communities are an essential factorin forest conservation and management. The policy pro- vides specific safeguards concerning Indigenous Peoplesand other forest dwellers, specifically their rights of access toand use of designated forest areas. In World Bank-assistedcommercial forest activities, the policy calls for a forest cer-tification system, which respects \"any legally documented or customary land tenure and use rights as well as the rights ofIndigenous Peoples and workers,\" and includes \"measures tomaintain or enhance sound and effective community rela-tions\" (paragraph 10). The policy also stresses the need todevelop the certification system \"with the meaningful partic-ipation of local people and communities; Indigenous Peoples;nongovernmental organizations [NGOs]\" (paragraph 11). OP 4.11 Physical Cultural Resources, is also relevant for forest projects affecting Indigenous Peoples. The policyaims to protect physical cultural resources, defined as \"mov-able or immovable objects, sites, structures, groups of struc-tures, and natural features and landscapes that have archae- ological, paleontological, historical, architectural, religious,aesthetic, or other cultural significance\" (paragraph 1).These resources \"are important as sources of valuable scien-tific and historical information, as assets for economic andsocial development, and as integral parts of a people's cul- tural identity and practices\" (paragraph 2). These resourcesmay include burial sites and spirit forests important to many forest communities, particularly Indigenous Peoples. The World Bank's policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12) applies to involuntary restrictions of access to legally designated parks and protected areas. The policyrequires that such restrictions be determined in participa- tion with affected communities and that adverse impacts bemitigated or compensated for. These arrangements aredescribed in a process framework prepared as a conditionfor project appraisal (guidance on the application of OP 4.36,OP 4.11, and OP 4.12 is included in chapter 9). The World Bank's Indigenous Peoples Policy (OP 4.10) is the key instrument to address Indigenous Peoples' issues forany type of World Bank-assisted investment project affect-ing Indigenous Peoples, whether the impacts are anticipatedto be positive or negative. The policy recognizes the rights ofIndigenous Peoples, which are increasingly being addressedunder international and national law. It notes that theiridentities and cultures are inextricably linked to the landson which they live and the natural resources on which theydepend, and that this combined with their frequent mar-ginalization and vulnerability often exposes them to partic-ular risks and impacts from development projects. The pol- icy recognizes the vital role that Indigenous Peoples play insustainable development, which is especially relevant formost forest-related projects (see note 1.3, Indigenous Peo-ples and Forests). 347 Applying OP 4.10 on Indigenous PeoplesCHAPTER 12IDENTIFICATION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES Indigenous Peoples today reflect a great variety of histories and circumstances that defy a single definition. Accepted orpreferred terms and definitions vary by usage among the groups concerned as well as by country and continent; terms used has been emerging regarding thegeneral identifying characteristics of Indigenous Peoples, consistent with those adopted in the World Bank's policy.OP 4.10 identifies (paragraph 4) Indigenous Peoples as \"adistinct, vulnerable, social and cultural group possessing thefollowing characteristics in varying degrees: self-identification as memb ers of a distinct indigenous cultural group and recognition of this identity by others; collective attachment to geographically distinct habitats or ancestral territories in the project area and to the nat-ural resources in these habitats and territories; customary cultural, economic, social, or political institu-tions that are separate from those of the dominant soci-ety and culture; and an indigenous language, often different from the officiallanguage of the country or region.\" OBJECTIVES OF THE POLICY OP 4.10 aims to protect the rights of Indigenous Peoplesand supports the World Bank's mission of poverty reduc-tion and sustainable development. The policy calls for the World Bank to provide project financing only when affected indigenous communities have provided their broad com-munity support to the project through a process of free,prior, and informed consultation. Projects affecting Indige-nous Peoples are designed to deliver culturally appropriate social and economic benefits to Indigenous Peoples andinclude measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, or compen-sate for any adverse impacts. KEY POLICY REQUIREMENTS The World Bank's policy on Indigenous Peoples applies to all investment lending projects affecting, whether positivelyor adversely, Indigenous Peoples. The key procedural requirements of the policy follow: screening by the World Bank to determine whether Indigenous Peoples are present in, or have collectiveattachment to, the project area a social assessment by the borrower to evaluate the pro-ject's potential positive and adverse effects on IndigenousPeoples, and to examine project alternatives where adverse effects may be significant an inclusive, transparent, and continuing process of free, prior, and informed consultation the affected Indigenous Peoples communities' broadsupport to the proposed project preparation, and disclosure, of an appropriate planninginstrument: an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) or Indige-nous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF) The level of detail and complexity necessary to meet the requirements of the policy are proportional to the complex- ity of the proposed project and the nature and scale of thepotential effects on the Indigenous Peoples. The time needed for project preparation comprising consultationswith affected Indigenous Peoples and the scope of socialanalysis also depends on the circumstances and vulnerabil-ity of affected communities. T echnical judgment is essentialin determining the appropriate approach. Most forest-related projects do entail potential risks for Indigenous Peoples, and borrower and project teamspreparing such projects should expect to pay significantattention to Indigenous Peoples' issues and concerns duringproject preparation and implementation. They should keepin mind that the particular rights, circumstances, and vul-nerabilities of Indigenous Peoples often result in impactsand needed design features for Indigenous Peoples that aredifferent from those for other communities living in or nearforest areas. Screening for Indigenous Peoples in the project area. Early in the identification phase the project team should assess, in coordination with the borrower, whetherIndigenous Peoples are living in or have collective attach-ment to the project area. Often the advice or input fromqualified experts is needed during this screening process,and consultations with affected communities also may beneeded. Social assessment. The main purpose of the social assess- ment is to evaluate the project's potential positive and adverse impacts on the affected Indigenous Peoples (andother affected communities). Critical to the determinationof potential adverse impacts is an analysis of the relative vul-nerability of, and risks to, the affected Indigenous Peoples'communities according to their distinct circumstances, tiesto the land, and dependence on natural resources, as well as 348 CHAPTER 12: APPLYING OP 4.10 ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLESlack of opportunities relative to other social groups in their respective communities, regions, or national societies.Indigenous Peoples' vulnerability is multistranded. It is not only economic, social, and political, but also demographic (at risk of being numerically overwhelmed) and environ-mental (if access to natural resources is restricted and theirsubsistence and livelihoods affected). They are oftenexcluded from political processes at all levels. They are often also more exposed to external shocks that have an impact ontheir lives, lacking the capacity to cope with such shocks orother external changes\u2014including those realized throughdevelopment projects (see box 12.1 for the policy's languageon social assessment). The assessment is also used to inform project design to ensure that activities are culturally appropriate, will enhancebenefits to target groups, and are likely to succeed in the givensocioeconomic and cultural context. The social assessmentwill usually include the establishment of a framework for con-sultation with and participation of the affected peoplethroughout the project cycle. This usually includes the processof free, prior, and informed consultation with affected Indige-nous Peoples, leading to their broad community support forthe project. However, this process may be conducted partly orfully separate from the social assessment process, particularlyfor more complex projects requiring several rounds of consul- tations during project preparation that go beyond the time-frame of the social assessment. A good social assessment will improve understanding of Indigenous Peoples' culture, social structure, institutions,socioeconomic characteristics, and the specific environmentand social context in which they live. It will identify stake-holders and analyze the local and national institutional con-text and legal framework relevant to the proposed projectand affected Indigenous Peoples, including legislation con-cerning customary rights, access rights to forests and natu-ral resources, and participation of Indigenous Peoples orother forest-dependent communities in forest and develop-ment planning. It should also reveal any social risks andexisting or potential conflicts. Combining analyticalprocesses with field-based knowledge, the social assessmentwill aid efforts to design culturally appropriate and gen-der-inclusive projects that take into account affectedIndigenous Peoples' views on the benefits that they canderive from a project, the role they can play in its imple-mentation, and how adverse impacts can be eliminated,reduced, or mitigated. The social assessment for forest-related projects, particu- larly those concerned with natural resource management,must assess the relationship between Indigenous Peoplesand forests, including livelihoods, culture, and social orga- nization. Mapping of traditional and existing land and nat-ural resource use for livelihoods as well as for cultural and spiritual practices should be an integrated element of the assessment. Potential conflicts and disputed claims concern-ing access to land and natural resources should be identi-fied\u2014and ways to address them should be recommended. Assumptions held by project developers and other stake- holders as well as by Indigenous Peoples about traditional resource use practices and their environmental impacts orbenefits may not hold true. If based on mainstream culturalmodels rather than a full understanding of the local context,Indigenous Peoples' practices may be viewed with skepti- cism or outright prejudice, rendering them unsustainable, regardless of whether the assumption actually proves to betrue. It is therefore important that interventions be based onreliable information obtained with the participation of localcommunities. It is the borrower's responsibility to conduct the social assessment, which is usually done by contracting with aresearch institute, university, consultant (firm or individ-ual), or NGO. The identified social assessment team musthave the required expertise, including knowledge of Indige-nous Peoples, and have the trust of the affected communi-ties. The project team provides assistance and also approves the terms of reference and the composition of the team forthe assessment. In addition to the World Bank's Indigenous Peoples Guidebook (forthcoming), guidance on conducting social assessments can be found on the World Bank's Web site onsocial analysis (www.worldbank.org/socialanalysis), in theWorld Bank's Social Analysis Sourcebook (World Bank 2003), and the World Bank's Social Analysis Guidelines in Natural Resource Management (World Bank 2005a). (See also sec- tions in this Forests Sourcebook on social assessment in chap- ter 9, Applying Forests Policy OP 4.36, and note 1.3, Indige-nous Peoples and Forests). Free, prior, informed consultation. OP/BP 4.10 focuses on the importance of engaging Indigenous Peoples in a process of free, prior, and informed consultation (see box12.2). Such a process has to be inclusive, including women,the poorest, and members of different generations. The con-sultation process should, in most projects, take place at eachstep in the project cycle\u2014project preparation, implementa-tion, and evaluation. This process includes the borrower, theaffected communities, and Indigenous Peoples' organiza-tions, if any, or other local civil society organizations iden-tified by the Indigenous Peoples' communities. CHAPTER 12: APPLYING OP 4.10 ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLES 349Key elements of the consultations during the preparation phase follow: information about the proposed project and its intended benefits and possible adverse impacts achieving understanding of Indigenous Peoples' percep-tions of possible project benefits and impacts, and possi-ble measures to enhance benefits and avoid or mitigate adverse impacts incorporation of Indigenous Peoples' views, prefer- ences, and indigenous knowledge into project designand the Indigenous Peoples instrument (Indigenous Peoples Plan or Indigenous Peoples Planning Frame- work) facilitation and determination of affected communities' broad support for the project development of a culturally appropriate framework orstrategy for Indigenous Peoples' participation throughoutproject preparation, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation, which may involve particular methodolo- gies to ensure participation of marginalized social groups,to build community consensus, to enhance transparency, to ensure local ownership of the process, and to assess andensure continued support for the project While most of these elements can be encompassed within the social assessment process, keeping project- affected people informed should also be part of the bor-rower's ongoing communications with people in the pro-posed project area. The borrower and the project teamshould keep in mind that free, prior, and informed consul- tations with Indigenous Peoples will likely require moretime than consultations with other affected communitiesand stakeholders. Consultations that may just require a fewhours in an urban setting may take days with IndigenousPeoples. Moreover, the consultation process for ascertaining the community's broad support for project activities willrequire more time and may go beyond the time frame of thesocial assessment process, particularly for more complexprojects. Many, if not most, projects affecting forests in areas with Indigenous Peoples would be considered complex (seenote 1.3, Indigenous Peoples and Forests). 350 CHAPTER 12: APPLYING OP 4.10 ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLESOP 4.10 provides the following guidance on the ele- ments of the social assessment (OP 4.10, Annex A): 1. The breadth, depth, and type of analysis required for the social assessment are proportional to the nature and scale of the proposed project's potentialeffects on the Indigenous Peoples. The social assessment includes the following ele- ments, as needed: A review, on a scale appropriate to the project, of the legal and institutional framework applicableto Indigenous Peoples. Gathering of baseline information on the demo-graphic, social, cultural, and political character-istics of the affected Indigenous Peoples' com- munities, the land and territories that they have traditionally owned or customarily used or occu-pied, and the natural resources on which theydepend. Taking the review and baseline information into account, the identification of key project stake-holders and the elaboration of a culturally appro- priate process for consulting with the IndigenousPeoples at each stage of project preparation and implementation (see paragraph 9 of OP 4.10). An assessment, based on free, prior, and informed consultation, with the affected Indige-nous Peoples' communities, of the potential adverse and positive effects of the project. Criti- cal to the determination of potential adverseimpacts is an analysis of the relative vulnerabilityof, and risks to, the affected Indigenous Peoples'communities given their distinct circumstances and close ties to land and natural resources, aswell as their lack of access to opportunities rela-tive to other social groups in the communities,regions, or national societies in which they live. The identification and evaluation, based on free, prior, and informed consultation with the affectedIndigenous Peoples' communities, of measures neces-sary to avoid adverse effects, or if such measures arenot feasible, the identification of measures to mini-mize, mitigate, or compensate for such effects, and toensure that the Indigenous Peoples receive culturallyappropriate benefits under the project.Box 12.1 OP 4.10 on Social Assessment Source: World Bank 2005b.A number of aspects of consulting with Indigenous Peo- ples should be recognized. Consulting in the local language is often needed, particularly to ensure that all community members are heard and feel comfortable raising their ideas and concerns. Efforts to build trust may be needed to reducefrequently encountered mistrust of government, projectdevelopers, or outsiders in general, built up during years ofexclusion. Other aspects that may affect the consultation process include traditional social structures and leadershippatterns, representation of communities, decision-makingprocesses (for example, through consensus building), andtraditions of oral transmission of knowledge and culture. Itis important to ensure that the team conducting or facilitat- ing the consultations understands these aspects, has the required skills to conduct meaningful consultations withIndigenous Peoples and has their trust. The use of independent entities that have the trust of the affected communities is often necessary to undertake free, prior, and informed consultations. Borrower involvement isneeded to obtain the communities' broad support for theproject because, in many cases, specific agreements willneed to be negotiated between the affected communitiesand the borrower. Having an independent entity facilitatethis process is usually preferred. For consultations to bemeaningful, their results need to be processed and used to inform project design and implementation. The resultsshould be described in the social assessment report, or in aseparate report on the consultation process, and, as appro-priate, in the Indigenous Peoples instrument used for proj-ect implementation. In addition to the free, prior, and informed consultations with affected Indigenous Peoples, the borrower and the proj-ect team normally consult a number of other stakeholders.Table 12.1 provides a basic overview of a typical consultationprocess and the key stakeholders involved. It should be usedonly as guidance to inform the planning of the consultationprocess for a given project\u2014the principles of the IndigenousPeoples' policy should be invoked as a basic guideline foreliciting practical solutions ba sed on the sound judgment of qualified experts. Many forest-based projects require morethan two rounds of consultations with affected IndigenousPeoples during preparation. The World Bank's Environmental Assessment Sourcebook section titled \"Public Consultation in the EA Process: A Strategic Approach, 1999, Update 26\" (World Bank 1999) provides general guidance on conduct-ing public consultations. For more guidance on consulta-tions with Indigenous Peoples, see the World Bank's Indige- nous Peoples Guidebook (forthcoming) and \"Participation and Indigenous Peoples\" (Davis and Soeftestad 1995). (See also chapter 9, Applying Forests Policy OP 4.36, and note 1.3,Indigenous Peoples and Forests). Broad community support. OP 4.10 requires that affected Indigenous Peoples' communities provide their broad sup- port for a project before the World Bank can support theproject. It is the responsibility of the borrower to achieve broad community support through the free, prior, andinformed consultation process. Evidence of such supportshould be provided in a detailed report (which could be thesocial assessment report) documenting: \"(a) the findings ofthe social assessment; (b) the process of free, prior, andinformed consultation with the affected Indigenous Peo-ples' communities; (c) additional measures, including proj-ect design modification, that may be required to addressadverse effects on the Indigenous Peoples and to provide CHAPTER 12: APPLYING OP 4.10 ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLES 351When a project affects Indigenous Peoples, the project team assists the borrower in carrying outfree, prior, and informed consultation with affected communities about the proposed project throughout the project cycle, taking into consider-ation the following: \"Free, prior, and informed consultation\" is con- sultation that occurs freely and voluntarily, with-out any external manipulation, interference, or coercion, for which the parties consulted have prior access to information on the intent andscope of the proposed project in a culturallyappropriate manner, form, and language. Consultation approaches recognize existing Indigenous Peoples' organizations, includingcouncils of elders, headmen, and tribal leaders, and pay special attention to women, youth, and the elderly. The consultation process starts early, because decision making among Indigenous Peoplesmay be an iterative process, and there is a need for adequate lead time to fully understand and incorporate concerns and recommendations ofIndigenous Peoples into the project design. A record of the consultation process is main- tained as part of the project files. Source: World Bank 2005b. Box 12.2 OP 4.10 on Free, Prior, and Informed Consultationthem with culturally appropriate project benefits; (d) rec- ommendations for free, prior, and informed consultationwith and participation by Indigenous Peoples' communities during project implementation, monitoring, and evalua- tion; and (e) any formal agreements reached with Indige-nous Peoples' communities and/or the IPOs [IndigenousPeoples' Organizations]\" (OP 4.10, paragraph 11). It is the responsibility of the World Bank to review the process and the outcome of the consultations to satisfy itself that the affected Indigenous Peoples' communities have pro-vided their broad support to the project. The World Bankdoes not proceed with the project processing if it is unable toascertain that such support exists (OP 4.10, paragraph 11). A mix of opinions, and sometimes disagreements, as to the overall desirability of the project should be anticipated.When considering the level of broad support for the projectand the strength of the consultation process itself, the proj-ect team should ensure that all relevant and appropriate sec-tors and subgroups of the communities have been givenopportunities to express themselves. If they have, and thebroad majority is generally positive about the prospects ofthe project, the finding that broad support exists would be reasonable. While a referendum may not be practical in mostsituations, there is a need for broadly based validation and documentation of what has been said, by whom, and how any specific agreements were reached and what they contain. Broad community support does not mean that everyone has to agree on a given project. Nevertheless, consensusbuilding is an important form of decision making among many Indigenous Peoples. Thus, consensus building shouldoften be an element of the free, prior, and informed consul-tations that aim to facilitate broad community support forthe project. A community's broad support may be based onspecific agreements for benefit-sharing measures or mitiga- tion of adverse impacts. As part of its due diligence in apply- ing OP 4.10, the project team must ensure that such agree-ments are adequately reflected in project design and theIndigenous Peoples' instrument. Indigenous Peoples' instrument.

An Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) is required for a stan- dard World Bank-assisted project with interventions affect- ing Indigenous Peoples identified at the time of appraisal.For projects with multiple subprojects or annual investment plans in which specific interventions are not known at thetime of appraisal, an Indigenous Peoples Planning Frame-work (IPPF) is required. If the overwhelming majority ofaffected people are Indigenous Peoples, the project designitself (described in the Project Appraisal Document and subsequently in the Project Implementation Plan and/or Operational Manual) may make up the instrument. Itshould include the relevant elements of an IPP . The instrument is intended to serve as a flexible and prag- matic implementation document; its activities are integratedinto the design of the project and address the issues discussedin the social assessment and agreed to during the consulta-tions (see annex 12A to this chapter for more guidance on theelements of an IPP or IPPF). The contents of the instrumentwill vary with the nature of the project as well as with thecharacteristics of the country and the Indigenous Peoplesaffected. Proportionality is crucial: The principle is to plan appropriately so as to include (and budget for) only thoseactivities that are necessary to deal with the Indigenous Peo-ples' issues identified by the social assessment, with consulta-tions proportional to the project impacts and benefits and thecircumstances and vulnerabilities of affected communities. For a project with no adverse impacts, it may suffice to include as the main part of the plan a strategy for targetingIndigenous Peoples and a participation and consultationframework to continue the free, prior, and informed con-sultation and to ensure the input and continued supportfrom Indigenous Peoples on specific project activities dur-ing implementation. The strategy also should aim to ensurethat the social and economic benefits of the project are cul-turally appropriate. Projects with adverse impacts would, inaddition, include measures to avoid, mitigate, or compen-sate for such adverse impacts. Specific institutional arrange-ments and capacity-building activities may be necessary andefforts should be made to work with local organizations andinstitutions as appropriate. Forest-based projects should assess and incorporate, as appropriate, indigenous knowledge and local resource man-agement arrangements into the instrument and the generaldesign of the project. Capacity building and strengtheningof Indigenous Peoples' organizations at local and nationallevels should be considered to enhance project implementa- tion as well as the affected communities' general ability toparticipate in, and respond to, development efforts. The monitoring and evaluation plan, including timing and methodology, should be designed to take into considerationany issues pertaining to Indigenous Peoples. It usuallyincludes some form of independent or external monitoring.Complaint mechanisms should incorporate local and tradi- tional methods as appropriate (see also note 1.3, IndigenousPeoples and Forests). Special considerations. The policy specifies particular areas, listed below, that merit special attention during preparation of projects affecting Indigenous Peoples. Eachone of these is potentially a critical issue for forest-basedprojects, which the borrower and project team need to con-sider carefully during project preparation and address in theIndigenous Peoples' instrument. Lands and natural resources. Projects affecting the lands and natural resources of Indigenous Peoples should include measures to recognize land tenure and resource use rights. This may include recognition and regulariza- tion of customary rights to land and natural resources. Commercial development of natural resources. Projects supporting commercial development of natural resources should, in consultation with Indigenous Peo- ples, identify the affected communities' rights to the resources under statutory and customary law, the scopeand nature of the proposed commercial development,and the potential impacts of such development on thecommunities' livelihood, environments, and use of such resources. The Indigenous Peoples should share equi-tably in the benefits. Commercial development of cultural resources and knowl- edge. Projects supporting commercial development of cultural resources and knowledge should identify, in consultation with the Indigenous Peoples' communities, their rights to such resources under statutory and cus-tomary law, the scope and nature of the proposed com-mercial development, and potential effects it may haveon the Indigenous Peoples' livelihoods, environments, and use of such resources. World Bank assistance to proj-ects supporting commercial development of culturalresources and knowledge of Indigenous Peoples is condi-tional on their prior agreement to such development. Access. Involuntary restrictions on Indigenous Peoples' access to legally designated parks and protected areas should be avoided or minimized. If not feasible, a process CHAPTER 12: APPLYING OP 4.10 ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLES 353framework should be prepared based on free, prior, and informed consultation with the affected communities andin accordance with OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement (see chapter 9 for guidance on development of terms of ref- erence related to OP 4.36). This should only be done in amanner that ensures that affected Indigenous Peoples shareequitably in the benefits, and that prioritizes collaborativearrangements. The process framework should be devel- oped in parallel with the Indigenous Peoples' instrument. Disclosure, appraisal, and documentation. As soon as the draft Indigenous Peoples' instrument has been prepared,it should be disclosed, together with the social assessmentreport, in a form, manner, and language culturally appro-priate to the Indigenous Peoples affected by the project.After the World Bank has reviewed the documents, andbefore appraisal, the borrower shares the revised instrumentwith the affected communities. If changes are made to theinstrument as a result of project appraisal, the final docu-ment to be used for implementation should be publicly dis-closed and shared with the affected communities. The appropriate sections of the Project Appraisal Docu- ment should include a careful description of the processesof social analysis and consultation undertaken during proj-ect preparation, including the broad community support obtained, as well as the design features and special measuresincluded to address particular issues concerning IndigenousPeoples during implementation. The implementation mea-sures in the Indigenous Peoples instrument should bedescribed in more detail in Annex 10 to the Project AppraisalDocument (Safeguard Policy Issues). The World Bank's Proj-ect Information Document and Integrated Safeguard DataSheet are disclosed at the World Bank's InfoShop along withthe Indigenous Peoples' instrument before appraisal. The appraisal mission should assess the project design with regard to policy requirements concerning IndigenousPeoples. The mission should usually include a social scien-tist familiar with Indigenous Peoples' issues and who hasoperational experience sufficient to evaluate the measuresplanned regarding Indigenous Peoples. The appraisal evalu-ates measures to address OP 4.10 requirements and Indige-nous Peoples' issues as appropriate for the given projectcontext, including the following: the adequacy of the free, prior, and informed consulta- tion process confirmation that affected Indigenous Peoples have pro-vided their broad support for the project based on free,prior, and informed consultationsthe feasibility and sustainability of the Indigenous Peo-ples' instrument, including participatory implementa-tion processes, that is intended to provide culturally appropriate benefits and to mitigate any adverse effects on Indigenous Peoples if required, the feasibility of any proposals for regulariz- ing land and resource tenure the adequacy of the enabling legal and policy frameworkfor implementation of proposed project measures the capacity of agencies charged with implementation ofthe Indigenous Peoples' instrument and adequacy andtimeliness of any capacity-building exercises during project implementation the capacity of affected communities and others who will participate in project implementation, including the ade-quacy of any capacity-building exercises during project implementation the adequacy of detailed budgetary and institutional arrangements for timely implementation of the Indige-nous Peoples' instrument implementation schedules with measurable benchmarksfor the Indigenous Peoples' instrument, coordinated asnecessary with the overall project implementation schedule the results of public disclosure of the Indigenous Peoples'instrument arrangements for project monitoring and complaintmechanisms The legal document includes a covenant requiring the borrower or the project entity to carry out in a satisfactory manner the Indigenous Peoples' instrument. It is oftenimportant, depending on the project, to include additionalcovenants concerning key actions or specific issues of the instrument. These can include, for example, actions requiredbefore the instrument can be implemented (such as staffingor other specific institutional arrangements, special studies,or further consultations); contentious or complex aspects ofthe instrument that should be highlighted to ensure they are fulfilled in a timely fashion (for example, regularization of land and resource tenure); or specific benchmarks, as part ofthe monitoring indicators, for monitoring timely implemen-tation of the instrument. Disbursement may be made condi-tional on the implementation of such specific actions. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION The importance of good monitoring and supervision of project implementation cannot be emphasized enough. Theborrower's monitoring and evaluation team and the World 354 CHAPTER 12: APPLYING OP 4.10 ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLESBank's supervision team must include appropriate expertise and skills in understanding how Indigenous Peoples viewdevelopment and how development efforts may affect them. Knowledge of the affected communities, local language competency, and skills in participatory assessment tech-niques should be valued. Monitoring of measures for Indigenous Peoples should be integrated into the project's overall monitoring and eval- uation system, but often with specific indicators and partic-ular monitoring and evaluation activities. Monitoringrequirements vary for different types of projects dependingon their scope, interventions, the characteristics of theaffected Indigenous Peoples, and the project's benefits to, and impacts on, them. For some simple projects with few Indigenous Peoples, and where project activities are primar-ily beneficial, the elements of the monitoring and evaluationsystem concerning Indigenous Peoples may be limited todisaggregating data by ethnicity or social groups. For proj-ects with significant impacts on indigenous communities,an elaborate monitoring and evaluation system conductedby an independent entity focusing on measures for Indige-nous Peoples may be needed. Forest-based projects should, in most cases, plan to pay significant attention to Indigenous Peoples' issues duringproject preparation because of the particular vulnerabilities, views, and circumstances of Indigenous Peoples in forestareas. It is important to assess whether assumptions forproject success are correct, whether there are any unin-tended impacts on affected Indigenous Peoples, andwhether they are able to participate in project benefits orwhether exclusion or other factors inhibit their participa-tion. Finally, it is important to assess community satisfac-tion and whether the project continues to receive broadcommunity support. Qualitative and participatory data collection methods to monitor and evaluate project impacts on Indigenous Peo-ples are useful. Such methods may include workshops, focusgroup discussions, informal interviews, mapping exercises,and other participatory assessment tools. Special studiesassessing specific implementation issues concerning Indige-nous Peoples through qualitative methods and field workmay also be useful. Participatory monitoring and evaluationdiffers from more conventional approaches by engagingbeneficiaries actively in assessing the progress and achieve-ments of the project; sharing control over the content, theprocess, and the results of the activity; and identifying cor-rective actions. When the people who are affected most by aproject participate in its monitoring and evaluation, theproject receives valuable input for improvements; account-ability and transparency may be improved; acceptance is likely to be heightened; and beneficiaries' participation in,and ownership of, implementation is likely to be enhanced. It may also foster learning at the local level and contribute to organizational strengthening and empowerment of localcommunities. A key element of World Bank supervision is assessing whether the Indigenous Peoples' instrument is carried out as agreed. Implementation of the instrument is a criticaldimension in decisions on project performance ratings. Theproject team also assesses implementation of the borrower'smonitoring and evaluation system and ascertains the extentto which monitoring information is used to strengthen project implementation and make needed adjustments\u2014 and whether it is able to include Indigenous Peoples' per-ceptions, concerns, and evaluations in the project feedbacksystem. Key questions to consider during supervision mis-sions include the following: Are the Indigenous Peoples' instrument and legal covenants being implemented? If not, what are the con-straints? What should be done to rectify this? Is there a need to change the agreed on activities or project design more generally? Are the affected Indigenous Peoples participating in project implementation? If not, what should be done toenhance their participation? How are Indigenous Peoples benefiting from projectactivities? How are their socioeconomic circumstanceschanging? What project impacts are there on Indigenous Peoples?Are there any unanticipated impacts (given their charac-teristics and socioeconomic circumstances, unantici- pated impacts are more likely for Indigenous Peoples than for other population groups)? Are impacts beingavoided or mitigated or should new or additional miti-gation measures be introduced? What are the risks concerning the affected Indigenous Peoples? Have those risks changed since project prepara-tion or have new risks surfaced? How should they be addressed or mitigated? What are Indigenous Peoples' perceptions about the project, its benefits, and its impacts? Do the respectivecommunities continue to provide their broad support to project activities? If not, how can this be changed? Does the project include new locations? Have they been screened for Indigenous Peoples? Is the capacity of the implementing agency and otherinvolved stakeholders increasing with project implemen- CHAPTER 12: APPLYING OP 4.10 ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLES 355tation? Is there a need for (additional) capacity-building activities? Is the monitoring and evaluation system working? Arethe findings informing project implementation? AreIndigenous Peoples participating in the exercise? At completion of a project, the project team should ensure that the Implementation Completion Report includes Indigenous Peoples' issues. The following shouldbe assessed: \"(a) the degree of Indigenous Peoples' partici-pation in the project cycle; (b) the impact of the project, both positive and adverse, on the affected Indigenous Peo-ples; (c) the achievement of the objectives of the relevantinstrument(s), as relevant; and (d) lessons for future oper-ations involving Indigenous Peoples. If the objectives of the relevant instrument(s) have not been realized, theImplementation Completion Report may propose a futurecourse of action, including, as appropriate, continuedpost-project supervision by the Bank\" (World Bank Proce-dures 4.10, paragraph 13). 356 CHAPTER 12: APPLYING OP 4.10 ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLESIndigenous Peoples Plan. OP 4.10 provides the following guidance on the elements of the IPP (OP 4.10, Annex B): \"1.The Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) is prepared in a flex- ible and pragmatic manner, and its level of detail varies depending on the specific project and the nature ofeffects to be addressed.

The revision also served to ramp up the World Bank's own engagement in the forest sector to reduce poverty without jeopardizing the environmental values intrinsic to sustainability. The strategy is founded on three equally important and interrelated pillars: \u007f harnessing the potential of forests to reduce poverty in a sustainable manner; \u007f integrating forests more effectively into sustainable development; and\u007f protecting vital local and global environmental services and values. Addressing these three pillars together makes the Forests Strategy complex and multifaceted. The Strategy is not just about growing or protecting trees, but involves a web of complex interactionsbetween policy, institutions, and incentives. The Forests Strategy embodies a multisector approach that takes into account activities, policies, and practices outside the forest sector that impact both forests and the people who depend on forests for their livelihoods. The Forests Sourcebook is a resource for World Bank clients, task managers, and other stakeholders to better design and implement projects in line with the Forests Strategy. It draws on the experiences of more than seventy experts, both within and outside the World Bank, who have applied innova-tive approaches to implementing the World Bank Forests Strategy. The Sourcebook is divided into two parts. The first part looks at issues that are priorities for the forest sector and addresses the operational aspects of those issues. It covers topics associated with using forests in ways that contribute to poverty reduction, improving forest governance, main- streaming forest considerations in macro policy dialogue, engaging the private sector, meeting thegrowing demand for wood, optimizing forest functions at the landscape level, and monitoring forest sector activities. The second part of the book offers guidance on implementing the WorldBank's Operational Policy on Forests (OP 4.36). Giving insight into the complex interplay between different realms of development work that effect or are affected by forests, the Forests Sourcebook is a valuable tool for any stakeholder involved in development or business projects that could have an impact on "}
