Watch this space and the Center for Inquiry's social media channels ( [Check out the introductory post, \"Oh Wonderful, it's World Homeopathy Week.\"](https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/oh-great-its-world-homeopathy-week/) [Learn about our lawsuit against homeopathy manufacturer Boiron here.](https://centerforinquiry.org/press_releases/homeopathy-manufacturer-boiron-sued-for-deceiving-consumers-with-junk-meds/) And, like all good things, World Homeopathy Week is coming to an end. We hope that we've made at least some headway in exposing the bizarre reality of one of the most egregious forms of snake oil. That reality is that [homeopathy is a fraud, a scam, and pseudoscientific nonsense](https://centerforinquiry.org/resources/homeopathy/). Homeopathy doesn't work, and it can't work. Those who manufacturer homeopathy and those who sell it are defrauding those who buy and use it. It's not enough to just point and laugh at homeopathy ... though as we've seen, it can be incredibly funny. The notion that duck offal can be used to treat influenza, that powdered dust mites treat asthma attacks, or that urethral secretions from those with gonorrhea solve genital itching is, once you have gotten over the nausea, laughable. The idea that the more you dilute something, the stronger it gets, is such patently obvious malarkey, fabricated by those who want to increase their profit margins, that all you want to do is giggle. And the thought of homeopaths in white lab coats, carefully diluting poisons time after time, striking the container each time against the surface of a leather-clad book\u2014and then trying to maintain there is a functional difference between products diluted 100 times or 200 times when in neither case a single molecule of the original substance can remain\u2014well, that's the stuff of [TV sketch shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMGIbOGu8q0). But humor isn't enough, because homeopathy hurts people. It kills people. And it isn't just the true believers who suffer. Children don't make the choice as to what products they take. Homeopathic manufacturers label their products to appeal to concerned parents, and retailers display them alongside real, science-based medicines in stores. Often the parent doesn't realize that what they are buying is at best worthless bunkum and at worst a poison that will worsen the child's health. After all, if it didn't work, and if it could be dangerous, why would the government allow it, and why would trusted stores sell it without warnings? There are many communities out there with incredible distrust of the medical establishment. Some have good reasons, others less so. But homeopathy plays on those fears, presenting itself as a safe, \"natural\" alternative. One of the most tragic results of the fear of \"Big Pharma\" has been the success of charlatans such as Andrew Wakefield, who linked vaccination to childhood autism. As a result of playing on parental fear, vaccination rates fell, and too many children suffered and died from the effects of measles, rubella, and, more recently, COVID-19. It didn't take long for the homeopaths to see autism and vaccination as a potential pot o' gold. [CEASE therapy](http://www.cease-therapy.com/cease-therapy/) (which stands for Complete Elimination of Autistic Spectrum Expression) promises a \"cure\" for autism, involving the use of homeopathy to remove the alleged toxins allegedly delivered through vaccination from the system of a child with autism. I can't laugh at that one. This is taking the deepest hopes of parents for their children and exploiting them for profit while delivering a worthless sham of a therapy. As regulatory bodies have clamped down on their [claims](https://www.asa.org.uk/news/cease-therapy-claims-must-stop.html), those who offer this \"therapy\" have shifted their language. But no number of edits to verbiage can change the bottom line here. CEASE therapy is flimflam and needs to be stopped. There's so much out there that is defrauding customers and so few people fighting against it. CFI wants to pick more fights with the snake oil salesmen and bunkum providers. For that reason, we have decided to bring all our efforts in this arena together under one roof. We're launching a new part of CFI, the [Office of Consumer Protection from Pseudoscience](https://centerforinquiry.org/advocacy/office-of-consumer-protection-from-pseudoscience/). Through this, we will be bringing legal action and issuing warning letters, seeking to educate and inform the public and legislators and pressuring regulators, both state and federal, to properly protect the public from the harms of these scam products and \"treatments.\" The website to the new Office includes a contact section. That's for you to tell us where you see pseudoscience being used to defraud. We can't promise to take every one to court, but the more we know about, the more we can fight. Core to CFI's mission is challenging pseudoscience. It's not enough just to be right in these situations. As skeptics and humanists, we have an obligation to protect people from the harm pseudoscience represents. We've done that for decades. Now we are doing it under a new name and a single organization\u2014the Office of Consumer Protection from Pseudoscience. World Homeopathy Week may be over, but CFI's battle to expose the fraud that is homeopathy is only just kicking into high gear. "}
