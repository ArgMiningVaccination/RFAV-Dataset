We have found that many times our website does not function well with Apple internet browsers such as Firefox and Safari. You will need to use the web browser Internet Explorer to complete the application. If you are unable to get to a computer that will work with the application, we welcome you to visit our office to complete your volunteer application Monday through Thursday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. or Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Please be sure to call at 909-558-8022 ahead of time to ensure our computers are available. How long is the process before I can volunteer? The volunteer on-boarding process will typically take 2-weeks to a month. The process can vary on availability of programs as well as the time it will take the volunteer to complete all required paperwork. When can I sign up for interviews? Once you complete the online application, you will be contacted by our office via e-mail within 5-business days indicating whether your application was accepted or declined. If your application is accepted, you will be able to sign up for an interview located in your volunteer calendar. Why do I have to get an influenza immunization? According to the centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), receiving an influenza immunization \"is the best way to reduce the chances that you will get seasonal flu and lessen the chance that you will spread it to others.\" For additional information about the \"flu\" shot, visit the CDC at [www.cdc.gov](http://www.cdc.gov/) or visit our employee health services office. When can I take orientation? How long is orientation? Typically, you will be invited to an orientation once you attend an interview and are accepted to be a LLUH Volunteer. Volunteer orientations are 3-hour sessions and include training about LLUH culture, programs, policies and safety. Please allow time to find parking and the orientation location. Volunteers that are late to orientation will be asked to reschedule for the next orientation. When do I begin training? Training is the last step before becoming an official LLUH Volunteer. Once all on-boarding requirements are complete, your volunteer coordinator will contact you to work with your schedule and sign you up for a volunteer training date. On the day of your training, you must present yourself in full uniform. Please be aware that the training length of each program will vary. "}
