Western medicine has more efficient techniques forsolving some kinds of health problems than othere.- For examples,medical problems related to stress may respond better toindigenous treatment whichsupplies Social and emotional support'to the patient. While Western medicine might also be described as :'indigenous\" to Western cultdre, the distinctionbetween the two terms seems clear .enough when they are used together.\"Western\" was chosen instead of \"moder\"because'of the many modern aspecth ofmedical systems outside the Western one, which in turn is characterized bysome'very ancient principles and practices.InfaCt,nosinglesystemcanbedeseribedestern\" pedicine, which islargely derived from both European and American practices.

A. One example of this is that rddical mastectomies were performed for many yearsbefore any careful epidemiological research emerged tohow that less drastictechniques were equally effettive in most eases. The bulk of standard Westernmedical practice has not been -developed or even validatedscientifically,-buthas arisen out `of an immediate need situationsomeone's Informed-Impressionor interested hunch. Medical training involves.an apprenticeship where skillsand information are paised from one individual to the.other, on the basig of what has worked for 0V-senior practitioner as well as onscientific evidence when it exists. LaCet, information is shared informally and anecdotally among colleagues.For example, obstetrical residents were overhsard.in a heated_ - discussion truer which kind of stitch to use to rephir a vaginal tear afterchildbirth, but no one was able to cite any research on the topic. -.All werearguing on an experiential losis.' Notwithstanding, biomedicind treating, what it cannot `measure \"sciehtifically,\" even' though what it can and does measure is continually expanding. A few years-ago, nauAea in pregnancy was considered a psychosomatic problem, and was interpreted as a womb's poor psychological adjustment or subconscious rejection of her unborn child. Recently, biomedical researchers have learned .that such nausea correlates with_higherretentionAgf_theA:rtegnancv.. Now_that__ science can measure hormonal changes and associate them with morning sickness,it ia seen os. positive occurrence (the'pregnancy is \"taking well\") rather thata psychological problem on the woman's part.In contrast to Western biomedicine, most indigenous medical,systema do notmake the sharp distinction between measurable deviance from expectedbiolOgical functioning, and not feeling well. Indigenous medipine oftendefines illness (as distinct from disease) in the social sense, asinterference with normal social behavior and the ability of the individual to function.Thus the, definition of illness is more encompassing, or_holistic,than disease, which represents merely changes that can be measured within anarrow biophysical framework. Interestingly-*enough, th official UnitedNations definition of health, which describes health a_ a state of physical, mental, and so al well-being and not merely the abse -e of illness, mirrors this definitio common to so Many indigenous medical systems.Indigenous 7_ icine also differs from Western biomedicine _n that the poshiblecauses of theisease may include problems or imbalances in the supernatural realc4 body imbalances, strong emotions, and the like. Beliefs about illnesscausation often form effective social controls when illness is the supposed13 outcome of deviant behavior. Frequently illness, health maintenance,religion, and social,relations arel.intimately interwoven.Indisputably, Western adomedicine:has made4major contributions dhealth, of its techniquee are Merl:laving There area however,problems thii-Ii-hanfailed to solve--becausejt has not recognized them as-'problems or considers them low priority (such as.many aspects of preventivecare), or because'they are defined and diagnosed by-another cultural system.If, for example, the indigenous system recogniz4scertain symptomconatellations as defining an illneiwAhat is'not recognized by the Westernsystem, the WeiternItrained practitioners may discount them as mere_usuperstitionsIllness, health Maintenance, religion, and social relationsmaybe intimately interwoven in-any culture. Whereas this is as true for\"Western\" culture as it ie tor- others, Western \"scientific\" medicine oftenignores this most important reality. The fact is, indigenous medical beliefsand practices thatare ignored by Western practitioners play important roles'in the Control'of social deviance and continual search for socialequilibrium.Inappropriate behavior, such as transgression of sexual norms,(adultery)*or social norms (being rude to one's elders) may be punished byillness (through the.work of deity or of a human with apacial powers).Appropriate behavior is seen as a preventive'measure, but if illness occurs inany case, then it might have been worse without the good behavior. In otherrelationships between illnpas and social equilibrium,'illness permits anoutlet for frustration or eccentricity. For example, women in Latin Americaare seen as being more snseeptible co \"nerves.\" When thin condition isdiagnosed, the subsequent.attentian may far 0relieveasswhichforced the woman ta-manifest the symptoms of withdrawal, depression, and lackof appetite.Within its own setting Western medicine also has social control-functions, and the norms that it upholds are Western middle and upper class,primarily Anglo norms. For example, !n the U.S,, both the patient and thepractitioner often blame the patient for an illness. Tension, overwork, pooreating habits and lack of exercise are all among behaviors which areattributed to many illnesses, some with a scientific basis, some not. Theindividual who behaves according 'to all these norms-is seen as warding offii ins p .In a_senia. thena Western,trained_practicitioner_working-in-a_nonWestern setting is dealing with a conflict or norms.. Beliefs about humanbehavior that are implicit in his approach to medicine are not a part of thereality of the patient population. The result is a dissonant situation inwhich the Western practitioner attempts, on the basis of 'his or herexpectations, to make the patient conform to a health belief system that thepatient does not share.Western and Indigenous PracticesAll this complicated by the fact that scientific knowledge is only a part ofWestern medicine. It is of little use in itself as separate from thepeoplewhose health it aims to 4mprove. The biomedicial system can be said to'include practich, organizations, and social roles in addition to knowledge.Knowledge, then, is applied to the individual through a delivety system thatcould hardly be described as value free, As the sciensols translated intothe art of medicine, many of the cultural values of its practitioners areincorporated into the delivery of, health care. Individuals from diversecultures trained as Western practitioners cannot help but absorb some of theaccompanying values, Which may inhibit their perception of some of therealities and needs of the non-Western population they serve. In addition,14 -5-- practitioners are often members of the upper4socioeconomic strata and dominant ethnic group in their area of operation. Because of these differences,numerous points exist where the beliefs and needs of the lent population and those of the Western-oriented praCtItLanera_fall to _-- acids_Not surprigingly, private practitioners have a strong incentive to be in tune with existing indigenous beliefs and practices since their liveliho6d depends on a satisfied clientele. Public sector programs do not always have this incentive, which is sometimes reflected in a lack of response cultural and individual expectations. Thus, both the Western-oriented private and indigenous sectors may provide important alternative sources of health care.F.Problems in the DeliVery of Western Health ServicesAnother major reason for Assessing the indigenous and private health sectorsis that:the public sector May have difficulty in reaching all the population of country.Many developing countries have large rural areas which are not - easily accessible, and where any Western type practitioners (doetors,.nursestrained nurse Midwives, dentists) are not comfortable living because the standards of living, educational system, and other similar factor-:is cannot compete with those in urban areas. As a result, public sector health care is sometimes set up with a referral system.However, this system depends on V40 scarce resources: rapid and affordable transportation, and time to invest in obtaining health care. The distribution of Western practitioners, who are concentrated in the_urban_areaa*_combined_eith-the-ineff-itieney-oftransportation, means that rural patients must invest a great deal of time to obtain modern health care. The shorpige of money, which results in, few and often understaffed clinics, has the same effect.There has been a myth in international health planning that, ....the pdorer the person and 411e greater his need, the more time he will have available to wait in cl 41, bring children to health centers,- makerepeated 'Visits, or attend le res and demonstrations (M S. Scrimshaw, 1974:790 _oIn fact, the opposite is true. This has been responsible for many failures in progans of modern health care. For instance, in a village in South India,most women are forced by economic necessity to work up to the eighth or ninthmonth of pregnancy; they \"are too busy to be able to come once a week and spend half a day or more waiting in the clinic\" (Djurfeldt and Lindberg, 1975:209).In Peru, a lack of time on the part of some housewives interacted with cultural factors to prevent adoption of water boiling, a seemingly simplepreventive health measure (Wellin, 1955:86-90).Modern physicians and government spending for health care are concentrated in the urban areas in the less-industrialized countries (Spirg!1967:148) (Sharpston 1976:26). This concentration is partly due to political factors. Many of the physicians are employed in large, well-equipped hospitals. These urban hoppitals are built for several reasons.One is identifiability.Identifiability refers to the exiInt to which an effect can be ascribed to aparticular decision-maker. It Ls politically expedient that improvements in health be high4Y identifiable. For many of the pervasive health problems in developing countries -- malaria, diarrheal diseases-and trachoma; for example--- the most effective approach might be a preventive one. But preventive)tethods. have a very low identifiability. Curative methods have much higheridentifiability and will therefore be preferred by political decision-makers'(Raiffa at al., 1977:73).. Another reason is the fact thht Western coitntrieaf...Latten-provide-money-for-tiesIth-Caref-and-in-sdditlon-ra-the-desire-for---identifiability, the donors often have the Western orientation toward curativehealth care and medical technology. A third reason is the relatively, greatpolitical and economic influ-ences of the high socioeconomic groups. Thebelargely urban groups are much more important in determining health carepriorities than their needs warrant. Their health problems resemble thosecharacteristic of the developed countries, being mostly the \"chronic' anddegenerative diseases typical of later life,\" such as heart disease and cancer (Sharpston, 1976:26). These diseases are generally treated by curativemethods involving a high degree of medical technology. All these influences, which also operate in the industrial nations,-.,tend to0-educe curative high-technology medicine centered in the larban areas.It hasbeen argued that these forms of health care \"have frequently served todissipate scarce local resources and skilled-manpower, and of._generalbenefit to the countries\" (MeMichael, 1926:7). putting:itstrongly, certainly mare equitable didtribution oft facilities andfphyeicians,and perhaps. are greater emphasis on prevention, would be more effective -inraising the-general level of health.Private and_ indigeno -tr_t_of-th4seffort.Although it is difficult to estimate the relatiVe use of privat andpublic health care, a study of the allocation of resources for health ca e inPe:estimates the monies spenton health care are evenly divided begfeenpuis and private resources.

C.SummaryTo summarize, the major reasons for including the indigenous and privatehealth sectors in they health sector assessment of a country are that 1.The population has deeply ingrained and functional health beliefs andbehaviors which must be considered and accomodated when Western medicaltechnology is introduced.2.Because of differing definitions of health and illness and the treatmentof illness the Western medical system may not supply all the medical needsof a population as defined by both that population and modern healthPlanners.3.'Mihimally accessible rural populations with poor infrastructures are notsuited for highly trained practitioners with Western medical values, andfor health service deliveTy systeMs designed lor urban of Westernsettings.16 A.e_CHATTER II. HEALTH SEEKING BEHAVIOR ndigenouq Health Roaated _Belief ,Sxattms*A medical'System is seen as \"embracing all of the health promoting beliefs andactions and 'scientific knowledge and skills of the members of the group.; thatsubScribe to the system\" (Foster and Anderson 1978:36). Medical dYstems canbe broken down into two subsystems for the purpose of Analysis: 1.A diseasethaolnyiltml, which \"embraces beliefs about the nature 01health, the. causes of illness, and the remedies and other cuttpgtechniques...\"(Foster and Anderson 1978-:37). It,is a conceptual systemwhich deals with classifications, explanation, and cause and effect.2.A health care syam, which is the way a society ._mobilizes the resourcesof the patient, his or\"her family, and the society to bring them to bearon the problem (Fter arid Anderson 1978:37). It involves the interactionof two people, _h patient and the curer.This distinction is particularly useful in situations where more than onemedical system exists, as is the case in most developing count-ries.% When thisdistinction is made. it.is possible, for example, ,to allow. people to retainelements of an indigenous disease theory system while 'adding a Westernizedcomponent to their health care's stem.'Universal of Medidal S stemSome aspects medical described below.** I._Medical Semare inte,ral gat of culture:The major institutions inevery culture are related to each Other and support each'other.

In addition, social institutions arereflected in the roles of curers and their relations to patients.

The naturalistic ,also presents problema:hecrause of two factors: First, in this etiology the patient is responsible for: diagnosing his own ilrntss.The patient informs the health practitioner of the 'diagnosis, and = expects him to prescribeftherapeutic measures.The Western-trained doctor's attempt to diagnose the Patient is not regarded as appropriate behavior. \u00b0- Second, the concept or health as an equilibrium between opposing forces (such as hot: .ind cold) is often a part of this-etiology. This concept, although it has recently been gaining greater acceptance in areas such as environmental health and ecology, it not generally part.oft3restern health training.This also leads to difficulties in communication between the health practitioner and the client.The preceding common beliefs about disease causation are important because these beliefs:have accompanying systems for prevention, diagnosis .and cure. While 'self-diagnosis and treatment occur in nearly all societies, the services of practitioners are also needed in many instances. Where strong indigenous21 /medicEll systems exist,, there may be. one oriretypesofrincliwouks practitioners . However, Western-oriented private practitioners may alsogenouS-he-1, and may incorporate them into their practices.SoMetimes, the distinctions. between indigenousand Western- oriented private sector prationers becotnes blurred, as will be seeninthe following discussion of indigenous practitioners.B. ,-Indigenous Pr and Western-Oriented Private Practitioner t,' Figure 1 Kesenti,a typology of health care practitioners ranging from .ill adults in asocietywho ,may know a few pimple, cures to, the highly trained and 1specialtWeste,rn-oriented or indigenous practitioner..

These are:1.S eCia ization; This tendency is well known in Western medicine, but it.;, . occurs in indigenous, medicine as well. Por'example, there may be bonesetteya, injectioitises and herbalists in addition to shamans and midwives.In some cases, specialization may influence prestige-in apposite way fromthe West, where the specialist is,usually more highly regarded.In Thailand, for example, a specialist is someone who only knows about only:one area, and thus has little knowledge. A generalist's knowledge is much broader and his prestige is_greater. 2.Selection and Training:, In some societies, as in the West, personalch Lce followed by long aid rigorouatrainin8 determines who becomes a he_ler.While some people are acknowledged to have more skill in a particular area (such as surgery) than others, superhuman beings are not seen as involved in particular selection,, ,tn contrast, in many indigencius aye ems, a divine.\"calling\" is considered important or even essential for ahaler.This may come about through something that occurred at birth (brseeh and caul births are Qften considered-special), or something which happens in'life. A common pattern is for someone to become very ill, and forhe shaman or other curer to discover that the illness is a \"summons\" to$comea healer, and can only be cured by the patients' commitment to -1 4- at role (Sharon 1978, Paul and Paul 1975). Usually an apprenticeship toother healer is then undertaken, although sometimes other powersdertake-to-teadr-thelformez- etlent.One-Audy-deheribes-a-midwife-inatemala who vas taught her p ofession by the spirits of dead midwives4aul and .Paul 1975).

',Often, indeed,personality characteristics that in Western aqciety would be branded deviant are early age.in children,Me-ibersof the group feel most fortunate\" (Foster and. AAdereon (1978:110.,'Expectation of Payment:% This ranges from clearly defined fees set by bothWestern oriented and indigenous practitioners to the feeling that the giftof healing comes from a divine being and it is to be sharid free ofcost.Many practitioners allow the patient to decide what to pay.Someare pa.id as long as patient is well, and payment ia stopped if illness_c-turaWhile7fwes--tharged-hricidigennua pratt ioners can be very high,in general, they are lower than those charged by Western-oriented privatepractitioners and sometimes lover than those charged by the-public health sector.Belief_in powers: Every socielThas a few practitioners who know theycannot help a patient but lead the patient to believe they can.Mostpractitioners, hoWever, both Western-oriented and indigenous`, believe theyare doing the best they can for their patienti.

This is .an important point, because Western-oriented practitioners and otherobservers sometimes consider indigenous practitioners \"quacks\" or\"charlatans.\" =Me Western medical system may .have more effectivesolutions to some.problema, but a practitioner who is acting in good faith is not a charlatan.1NINAttitudes of the public: 4t1most cultures medical practitioners are bothfeared and revered, admired and critized. Much of this is due tothepower held and exercised by most medichl practitioners. \"In allsocieties, people fear, and hence dislike and distrust their fellows whoexercise power, potential or real, over them. This is particularly true.when the average man has only an imperfect understanding of the nature ofthis power\" (Foster and Anderson 1978:114). Patient - Practitioner InteractionsAs can be seen from the above discussion, there are many similarities betweenWestern-oriented and indigenous practitioners. However, there are also Rome'impbrtant differencei, which may influihce aspatient's choice of care.In thetreatment process, the patient and the physician Bch has a Pet ofexpectations.When these dif fez, misunderstandings and conflicts may2,1-7 develop.' Poi example, a paper on the potential for,thegintegration of.Indigenous and 'Western medicines in the,U.S.-Mexico border area, presents the following-discussion-0 roAderpatUnt-Tra-6ra-CtinniThe Western.-trained physician is educated to remaiq objective and \"scientific\" in his dealings with patients.Part of th'e image he projects is that of a neutral, ,objective Afterver and dititnostic,ian of human disorders- ain short,\"professional.: To the 14xican-' American patient, 'who needareassuranice and warmth, touching inimportant. during diagnosis and reflects caring.The Western attitude is incomprehensible,and seems cold and Impersonal, if not hostile. Furthermore, it reinforces already present fears of discrimination by Angle- Americans tfficiency is 'another characteristic that is.htghly prized by Western medicine and philosophy in general. The physician, faced with a ftravy patient load-and minimum funds,. avoids lengthy discussions with I his patients and gets quickly to the point of the visit. TO the Mexican-American patients, illness is too serious and frightening to rush.The 'proper\" medical person makes some small conversationbefore getting down to business. The physician's lack of preliminary pleasantries or concern with the patient's own opinion of his illness is rongirlaed rude -and-does-nothirtg-to-4-allay-parient-fews-ann .prejudices.A common source of poor communisation between patient and physician is attitude toward authority. The Western, practitioner expects his patients to recognize his authority and feels it is his patient's responsibilityto seek and follow his professional advice.The indigenous practitioner, however, does not dictate to his patient, but merely makes Bugg scions. To the Mexican - American, the-----physician's-attitudq- --seen as authbritarian and presumptuous.Western medical philosophy emphasizes the individual and his responsibility for his own illness. Anglo-Americans commonly tke2)blame for havt become sick.As discussed previously, Mexicandisease theory i cludes a view of the individual as the victim of external forces. Nor is the individual free to make decisions on acceptance of treatment. Professional medical personnel expect the patient to make quick decisions and to accept the physician's Advice.However, to the Mexican or Mexican-American patient and in the indigenous system, a practitioner's opinion may influencedecision-making but will not constitute the final authority. :Individuals do not act alone in situations as important as illness. Validation and support, both economic and social, of the sick role must come from the patient's family. Diagnosis and treatmentsuggested by the practitioner, be he or'she Western or indigenous, will be discussed, evaluated, and accepted or rejected Sy the patient's family as a whole. Chiding or scolding the Mexican-American patient for his negligence or demanding on-the-spot medicaldecisions' will only increase patient anxiety. (S. Scrimshaw and Burleigh 1978:37-38) 116- N. As mentioned previously, many Westerboriented'private practitioners do not in fact' understand and incorporate aspects of indigenous belief systems For example, .,.i.----4f-a-Latin-Amer4can-womsn-tetta-a-ptivXtI-prattftioner-She has unerveil\"The is more likely to use this as an opekng to get her to further describe her problem further rather than'te say there is no such thing.C.The Private SectorAs stated earlier, reliable information the pr #vats subsector is almost. .nonexistent, although many rural health activities have occurred independently of planned national development, Many philanthropic and reliapus organizaiions have established hospitals and health centers` inrrural areas.Although permission to do so tay have been sought, attempts to coordinatetheir activities with those of the national health, activities have proven unsucce sful in most cases. Until recently, the private and, indigenousZ...-subsect ra have generally functioned independently of national healthservices.It is at this juncture that the private and the indigenous--aubsectors have their greatest similarity despite the fact that the pylvate subsectors are usually oriented toward Western medicine. It should be stressed that private resources for health care can be found in both rural and,urbanfareae,,but the concentration of private wealth in urban centers means that private medical care.plays a greater'rolairt those places: If.haa been. stated that it is the incompleteness and the deficiencies of the public--media l-tareProgradff-that geriait'a private sector to flourish (Roemer,. 1963).An integrated and comprehensive system'of medical care would doubtles reduce the private sector to much smaller proportions. l'atients who were served adequately in a public:system Would not take recourse: Co private practitioners. However, the allocation of time and resources ieem-to be thedetermining factor for many urban and rural dwellers 'in deciding what type of practitioner to frequent for any or all diseases (Warren; 1974;,Grollig,1976). The-private- \"market cannot -be- expected to allocate to health either the amountor the composition of resources that is best from a social perective.For example, procedures 'Which halt the spread of communicable diseUes yield benefits to entire communities and, therefore, cannot be chosen properly byprivate individuals acting in their own iaterest. Often the private marketmechanism will direct resources to these health expenditures that have an attractive financial payoff. Frivaee corporations frequently undertake%disease control before opening up new land for comme cial plantation ormineral exploitation.- 4 In programs to improve the general health of the bulk of the population- theprivate market mechanism undeniably- operates but the distortions are very serious.Because of maldistribution of incomes in countries where averageinco$es are also vier), low, the health needs of the poor are not translatedint8 effective demand. WP ile the distortions caused by income inequalityapplies to all sectors, the consequences for health are particularly tragic.Furthermore, concentrations, of population have an adverse consequence on thedistribution of health resources.. Since urban centers are the focus of a casheconomy, they attract a disproportionate number of persons who can afford to pay for part or all of their health care. `Thus, the extent of urbanization isone of the factors'influencing the- extent to which a can of. whom have been trainedat governreexpoe) will enter' private practice In this work, they may beled to pay more attention to ,curative care than to prevention'and they will ,0 ,_ specialitation, in which some physicians find the highest_professional rewards.

They may be differentiated by philosophical world view (a folk healer versus a physician), by training or specialization (10.e., Whether received in a formal institution or apprentiCeship), and by treatment (i.et.,bone_setterv,herbaliat.,_or-:----- -physician) .-tSee'P-=.-23-6f-thie *ManualNumbers rview on the order of magnitWde of the number of different types of practitioners, as compared to absolute numbers, that are practicing within the area. 3.DistributionUnder _ending where the.variOupMpea of practitioners are located is very. important.This can beat,be determined by mapping the area under investigation. As shall .be shown, this stevis necessary to.correlate types of clientele serviced by the practitioners and the clients general socio- economic:conditions. 4.TrainingThe type of training received by the practitioners, skills maintenance, access to new information, and continuing education are the immediate concerns.5. Attitudes Attitudes toward their own and .other healing systems towards the integration of healing systems, and toward healing itself. Clientele 1.Size Information on clientele is quite essential as the number of inhabitants andtheir age-distribution in part determines the extent and nature of the medical attention with which a community must be provided. The pathway of a young populationll be different from that of a community in which ages of the inhabitantsa higher and which will therefore require medical attention of a different kind. P _The., population of -the region should be reported since it represents thepotential-size of the clientele. One of the approaches previously mentionedshoUld be utilized to determine how many patients (the actual clientele) go towhat type of practitioners and for what type of services. It should beexpected that many patients may utilizta variety of indigenous and privatepractitioners for a single particular illness. 2.-ocr tbilt on Another important CharacterisAdApf the population of a local planning area is'its geographic distribution within the area, including-the number and size oftheApopulatioh centers. The,yrovision of services in predominently ruralareas calls for a different 'approach than that required in.areas that are principallX%urban in character..'The distribution of clients should be shown by_mapping_the area as was dine---wIththe-diattibUtien-tif-the practitioners. In some cases it should beexpected that a majority of the clients of the indigenous practitioners wouldbe located, in marginal areas and those of the.private practitioners in more affluent areas.. Ibis could be correlated to the type of practitioner. Toooften the privileged and well to do, living in large towns and cities, enjoyaccess to all the complex technology and lifesaving apparatus of Western,medicine (Mahler 197,7). But in some affluent areas along with the developmentof a stronger sense of national or ethnic identity, a concomitant respect fornational or ethnic medical traditions has developed. Hence, thistrend maybe ,reflected in the distribution and utilization patterns of theclientele., This step would establish a determination of how the clientele utilizes the private or indigenous praCtitioners. The pattern could be approached byspecific illness. In many areas the practitioner of Western medicine are mostcommonly utilized for infectious diseaset and trauma while the indigenouspractitioners are Utilized for the more psychosomatic illnesses. Dual andmultiple utilizatioMb should also be observed. The major determinants forutilization patterns would be access to services, cost, acceptability, andpetceived effectiveness.4.. Socio- economic StatusIndicators such as .last year attended in schooli,geppation,Animonhlyrotr---iiriiieist in completing the assessment of the clientele and to distinguish which segments of the centele would utilize what type of practitioner. 5.AttitudesAttitudes toward health and illness, various health systems, and teps to take to treatlines/3.Practi1.TypeThere are basically Mee types of institutions which the assessor should be aware:ers ReproductiveThese would be the institutions which train morepractitioners in the same art.

The labeling of 'the degree of severity of an illness by the rticular type of practitioner should be considered here, too-. 42.Number A reporting of the different types of Consultation officers and types of institutions within the defined geographic area would be necessary.3.DistributionThe regional map from the previous steps could also be utilized to pinpoint. distribution of the institutions and how they relate to the distribution ofthe clientele and practitioners. 4.treat ionnf ito Clien eleHow is the patient admitted into the institution? The barriers to admissionsare more pronounced when dealing with the Western-type health care qubsector.The pattern of the indigenous practitioner should be delineated. 5.Relationahiabetween_Typesof InstitutionsDo the indigenous and:Western-trained practitioners work together at.tht_utional,level? Are clients referred from one aubsector to the other? y cesourtes's a_ r7i5TEliiiiiiiiSgonisms between the types o practitioners? Conceivably, there could be no relationship at all.44 Expenditures _oall Practitionereand nstitutions When the total amount of money flowing to practitioners and institutions isknown, it would be important to trace their expenditures. Perhaps a .percentage of the funds could be recycled in the region.through the purchaseof equipment and supplies, rental of facilities, and hiring employees.Perhaps important equipment and supplies from outside the region or abroadcould create a net loss.1.sgal Status 1._Legislative In many countries there may be a number of statutes regarding what can orcannot be done toapatient by a particular type of practitioner. In some-countries, certain types of indigenous practitioners are illegal or, inothers, private practitioners are forbidden. Furthermore, these tend to be hisla-t-ions-that-requi-r-ivate f3LWs1A1.efTap-170-ye-etriat a certain number-toprovide a lim4ted amount of health care. This type of information tends to beeasily obtained at the central ministry of health. 2=Custom or Comi_nLaw Status Not all laws are enforced all the time nor are they enforced equally. Quiteoften these will be a generally accepted understanding among authorities andbetween 'authorities and practitioners about what can and cannotbedoeewithsut legal interventions. In many countries where private practices areillegal, they have been permitted to develop without tremendousinterference.In some cases they have actually been encouraged to try to meetsome Of the demands on the public Hubsector. Where legislation has beenpassed against indigenous. practitioners, it does not appear to have succeededin causing them to cease practice as long as there is popular demand for theirservices.An understanding of the reasons for lack of enforcement should be-understood.It could require some insight into the interplay betweenpolitical, economici And sociocultural variables. oRelations-between Indi nous Practitionerg- 1.Functional Description11.A functional description of the relations between the practitioners could beof great utility. It may be quite common for the practitioners of Westernscientific medicine to denounce and deride the indigenous practitioners or toutilize them in one form or another. The relations could be as follows:No Relationship--This could often be the case where the established-Western scientific,practitioners would not acknowledge the existenceof any practitioners. However, the indigenousjiubsectot almostalways would haveto acknowledge the practitioners of the othersubsector.This situation would probably be the case in:dountriesWNW-Fe-MU geuecto45 Formal or:Informal Relationship- -The practitioners of one subsector could, refer clients to the other, exchange information, and occasionally share resources.This situation would'probably be the case in countries, where the indigenous subbector is more formal.2111mAeA4Li1212e! Social:institutions are never static either within themselves or between themselves.Health care institutions'are no exception.It should not be uncommon at all to discover alterations or shifts in the dynamics of relations between and among public and private practitioners of Western scientific medicine and the various indigenous practitioners. In attempting to remove the-vestiges-of A-Ceionialist'or imperialist past, nationalist or political movements could frequently influence health care institutions. In some cases, the dynamics of change could be manifested by increasing the legal and social:: status of the indigenous practitioners and, hence, increasing their responsi- bilities in some proportion of those of the public-and private practitioners.1.Rel ter7E-41=1!n5Lty:L enLPThere should be some attempt to discover the importance that clients attached to each of the subsectors available to them. As stated previouslY, there could be patterns of multiple utilizations. The assessor should relatethe dynamics of utilization patterns from the perspective of the client.Some outstanding variables could be::,EthnicityEthnic Identity.Ethnic group identity could deny the availability of''one-form of health care to a particular pers -Similarly, the eme. rgence of this identitv could make particular t- f indigenous practices morempliealing.,.Personal ExanLEZsPrevious eXperience with one subsector or the other could influence a client's choice. If administrative difficulties are encountered in :gaining admission to a hospital,- a client may not be favorably inclined towards utilizing that alternative in the future even though other variables would indicate. such predisposition.Constituent Interest Private ProvidersIn addition to private practitioner of Western medicine, the private subsector could include but not be,limited to health services offered by religious, benevolent, charitable, voluntary, philanthrop-organiza-tions,' political parties or movements, labor unions, and national and multinational corporations. There could be some correlation between the goals of the providers and the constituency served. The type of. information gathered in the previoui steps for assessing the privAte and the indigenous providers could likewise be applied for the special interest private providers. CRAFTV.5ICONCLUSIONS This manual has described the basis for including both indigenous and p- vetepractitioners in a health sector assessment, including the nature andimportance of culture-specific beliefs about health and - illness and theshorpsge of Western medical services, especially in rural and poor areas ofdeveloping countries. Methods for assessing the importance, the presence andthe acitivities of both indigenous and Western-oriented private practitionerswere also presented, as were methods Loy assessing the use of:health providersand the health belief-systems of-the population -at- large.There is little doubt that private practitioners, .and particularly, indigenouspractitioners must be incorporated into the network of health care providersif there is to be any hope at all of providing the rudiments of healthservices to all by the year 2,000, a major goal of United Nations and otherinternational agencies ABannerman 1977,_Kleinman 1978).___Without_the_help of_suepractitioners, many individuals and many regions will remaininaccessible.Tt is hoped that this manual will contribute to the effort to.incorpdrate private Western-oriented and indigenous:practitioners into the health networks of developing nations. 4 7 REFERENCES _Abel-Smh, Brian.An_ Innational Stud Health-- Ex'enditure.
