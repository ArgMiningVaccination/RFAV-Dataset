Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00693)]. Many of the new vaccines use completely new technologies that have never been used in humans before. The rationale for this action was that the pandemic was such a ubiquitous and dangerous threat that it warrants exceptional measures. In due course, the vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV2 has started. To date (18 June 2021), roughly 304.5 million vaccination doses have been administered in the EU ( [https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/vaccine-tracker.html#distribution-tab](https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/vaccine-tracker.html#distribution-tab)(accessed on 18 June 2021)), mostly the vector vaccination product developed by the Oxford vaccination group and marketed by AstraZeneca, Vaxzevria [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00693)] (approximately 25% coverage in the EU), the RNA vaccination product of BioNTec marketed by Pfizer, Comirnaty [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00693), [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00693)] (approximately 60%), and the mRNA vaccination product developed by Moderna [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00693)] (approximately 10%). Others account for only around 5% of all vaccinations. As these vaccines have never been tested for their safety in prospective post-marketing surveillance studies, we thought it useful to determine the effectiveness of the vaccines and to compare them with the costs in terms of side effects. 2. Methods [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00693)] that involved approximately one million persons and the data reported therein to calculate the number needed to vaccinate (NNTV) to prevent one case of SARS-CoV2 infection and to prevent one death caused by COVID-19. In addition, we used the most prominent trial data from regulatory phase 3 trials to assess the NNTV [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00693), [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00693), [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00693)]. The NNTV is the reciprocal of the absolute risk difference between risk in the treated group and in the control group, expressed as decimals. To give an artificial example: An absolute risk difference between a risk of 0.8 in the control group and a risk of 0.3 in the treated group would result in an absolute risk difference of 0.5; thus, the number needed to treat or the NNTV would be 1/0.5 = 2. This is the clinical effectiveness of the vaccine. [http://www.adrreports.eu/en/search_subst.html](http://www.adrreports.eu/en/search_subst.html)#, accessed on 28 May 2021; the COVID-19 vaccines are accessible under \"C\" in the index). Looking up the number of single cases with side effects reported for the three most widely used vaccines (Comirnaty by BioNTech/Pfizer, the vector vaccination product Vaxzevria marketed by AstraZeneca, and the mRNA vaccine by Moderna) by country, we discovered that the reporting of side effects varies by a factor of 47 ( [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00693-f001)). While the European average is 127 individual case safety reports (ICSRs), i.e., cases with side effect reports, per 100,000 vaccinations, the Dutch authorities have registered 701 reports per 100,000 vaccinations, while Poland has registered only 15 ISCRs per 100,000 vaccinations. Assuming that this difference is not due to differential national susceptibility to vaccination side effects, but due to different national reporting standards, we decided to use the data of the Dutch national register ( [https://www.lareb.nl/coronameldingen](https://www.lareb.nl/coronameldingen); accessed on 29 May 2021) to gauge the number of severe and fatal side effects per 100,000 vaccinations. We compare these quantities to the NNTV to prevent one clinical case of and one fatality by COVID-19. 3. Results [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00693)]. A recent large field study in Israel with more than a million participants [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00693)], where Comirnaty, the mRNA vaccination product marketed by Pfizer, was applied allowed us to calculate the figure more precisely. [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00693-t001)presents the data of this study based on matched pairs, using propensity score matching with a large number of baseline variables, in which both the vaccinated and unvaccinated persons were still at risk at the beginning of a specified period [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00693)]. We mainly used the estimates from [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00693-t001), because they are likely closer to real life and derived from the largest field study to date. However, we also report the data from the phase 3 trials conducted for obtaining regulatory approval in [Table 2](#vaccines-09-00693-t002)and used them for a sensitivity analysis. [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00693)]) and remained below 3% after six weeks. In the other studies, the incidence figures after three to six weeks in the placebo groups were similarly low, between 0.85% and 1.8%. The absolute infection risk reductions given by Dagan et al. [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00693)] translated into an NNTV of 486 (95% CI, 417-589) two to three weeks after the first dose, or 117 (90-161) after the second dose until the end of follow-up to prevent one documented case ( [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00693-t001)). Estimates of NNTV to prevent CoV2 infection from the phase 3 trials of the most widely used vaccination products [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00693), [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00693), [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00693)] were between 61 (Moderna) and 123 ( [Table 2](#vaccines-09-00693-t002)) and were estimated to be 256 by Cunningham [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00693)]. However, it should also be noted that the outcome \"Documented infection\" in [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00693-t001)refers to CoV2 infection as defined by a positive PCR test, i.e., without considering false-positive results [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00693)], so that the outcome \"symptomatic illness\" may better reflect vaccine effectiveness. If clinically symptomatic COVID-19 until the end of follow-up was used as an outcome, the NNTV was estimated as 217 (95% CI, 154-304). [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00693)]. [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00693-t001), we calculated the absolute risk difference to be 0.00006 (ARD for preventing one death after three to four weeks), which translates into an NNTV of 16,667. The 95% confidence interval spanned the range from 9000 to 50,000. Thus, between 9000 and 50,000 people need to be vaccinated, with a point-estimate of roughly 16,000, to prevent one COVID-19-related death. [Table 2](#vaccines-09-00693-t002), in the case that positive infection was the outcome [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00693)], we calculated the NNTV to prevent one death using the IFR estimate of 0.5%; in the case that clinically positive COVID-19 was the outcome [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00693), [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00693)], we used the case fatality rate estimated as the number of worldwide COVID-19 cases divided by COVID-19 related deaths, which was 2% ( [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)(accessed on 29 May 2021)). In the case of the Sputnik vaccine, one would thus have to vaccinate 22,000 people to prevent one death. In the case of the Moderna vaccine, one would have to vaccinate 3050 people to prevent one death. In the case of Comirnaty, the Pfizer vaccine, 6150 vaccinated people would prevent one death, although using the figure by Cunningham [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00693)], it would be 12,300 vaccinations to prevent one death. [www.lareb.nl/coronameldingen](http://www.lareb.nl/coronameldingen)(accessed on 27 May 2021)) are given Discussion [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00693)]. [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00693), [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00693), [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00693), [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00693)]. This might explain why children and younger people are rarely afflicted by SARS-CoV2 [ [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00693), [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00693), [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00693)]. An innate immune reaction is difficult to gauge. Thus, low seroprevalence figures [ [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00693), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00693), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00693)] may not only reflect a lack of herd immunity, but also a mix of undetected cross-reactivity of antibodies to other coronaviruses, as well as clearing of infection by innate immunity. [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00693-f001)) that the reporting standards vary hugely across countries. It might be necessary for the EMA and for national governments to install better monitoring procedures in order to generate more reliable data. Some countries have tight reporting schemes, some report in a rather loose fashion. As we have to assume that the average number of side effects is roughly similar across countries, we would expect a similar reporting quota. However, when inspecting the reports according to countries, we can see a large variance. Our decision to use the Dutch data as a proxy for Europe was derived from this discovery. One might want to challenge this decision, but we did not find any data from other countries being more valid than those used here. Apart from this, our data tallied well with the data from the U.S. CDC vaccine adverse reporting system [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00693)], which indirectly validates our decision. [https://www.lareb.nl/media/eacjg2eq/beleidsplan-2015-2019.pdf](https://www.lareb.nl/media/eacjg2eq/beleidsplan-2015-2019.pdf)(accessed on 29 May 2021)), page 13: \"All reports received are checked for completeness and possible ambiguities. If necessary, additional information is requested from the reporting party and/or the treating doctor The report is entered into the database with all the necessary information. Side effects are coded according to the applicable (international) standards. Subsequently an individual assessment of the report is made. The reports are forwarded to the European database (Eudravigilance) and the database of the WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring in Uppsala. The registration holders are informed about the reports concerning their product.\"). [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00693)]. This provides a potential causal rationale for the most serious and most frequent side effects, namely, vascular problems such as thrombotic events. The vector-based COVID-19 vaccines can produce soluble spike proteins, which multiply the potential damage sites [ [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00693)]. The spike protein also contains domains that may bind to cholinergic receptors, thereby compromising the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathways, enhancing inflammatory processes [ [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00693)]. A recent review listed several other potential side effects of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines that may also emerge later than in the observation periods covered here [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00693)]. [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00693)]. This should be studied more systematically in a long-term observational study. [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00693), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00693)]. The median underreporting can be as high as 95% [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00693)]. 5.
