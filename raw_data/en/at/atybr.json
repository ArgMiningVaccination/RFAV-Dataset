These antibiotics may include haridra powder, guggulu, etc. - The patient is anesthetized with general or spinal local anesthesia. - The surgeon then takes a malleable probe and inserts into the external opening of fistula to the internal opening in the anal canal. - Thereafter, the Kshar sutra is gently pulled out with probe through the anal opening and both ends of the thread are tied together. - The ayurvedic drugs that are coated over the thread do their work and help in treating the tract as they slowly and gradually release in the tract. - As a result, the abscess is drained out by the help of those drugs. - After one week, the Ayurvedic doctor replaces the thread. - The medicated thread, i.e., the Kshar sutra cuts and heals the tract.
