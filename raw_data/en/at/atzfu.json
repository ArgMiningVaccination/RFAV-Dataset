Included in these amendments is the recodifying of the public notification requirements from the Technical Requirements for Site Remediation (Technical Requirements, N.J.A.C. 7:26E-1.4) in the [Administrative Requirements for the Remediation of Contaminated Sites (ARRCS, N.J.A.C. 7:26C-1.7)](../regs/arrcs/index.html). Please note: ARRCS states that public notification must be conducted 14 days prior to commencing field activities associated with the Remedial Action (RA). This differs from the previous requirement in the Technical Requirements that public notification must be conducted 14 days prior to commencing field activities associated with the Remedial Investigation (RI). This change was made in error and the requirement for public notification will be changed back to the RI in a future rule amendment package. Until the amendment package is adopted, and as mentioned above, the Department believes that it beneficial to everyone the early that public outreach and notification occurs, and supports RPs conducting public outreach and notification occurs prior to the RA. The Department has compiled a list of [FAQs](public_notification/public_notification_faq.htm), and developed the following guidance to help remediation parties comply with the amendments: | ||Document: || |[Public Notification & Outreach Guidance ||Training Links on this topic: || | N/A - Response Action Outcome Guidance Document (RAO) (NOTE: This document was formerly \"Issuance of Response Action Outcomes\") | || | Brief Description of Document The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has issued this guidance document to assist licensed site remediation professionals in the structure of a response action outcome (RAO), the different types of response action outcomes, when a licensed site remediation professional may issue a response action outcome, to whom it may be issued and when the licensed site remediation professional is to include specific inserts and reporting requirements in a response action outcome.
