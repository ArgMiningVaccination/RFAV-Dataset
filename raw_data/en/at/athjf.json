The Plan must cover this care if a pr udent lay person having average knowledge of health services and medicine and acting reasonably would have believed that an emergency medical condition or life -or limb -threatening emergency existed. 4 Transplants will be covered only if they are medically necessary and the facility meets clinical standards for the procedure. Grandfathered Health Plan Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield is treating this as a grandfathered health plan under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act). As permitted by the Affordable Care Act, a grandfathered health plan can preserve certain basic health coverage that was already in effect when that law was enacted. Being a grandfathered plan means that your Benefit Booklet may not include certain consumer protections of the Affordable Care Act that apply to other plans, for exampl e, the requireme nt for the provision of preventive health services without any cost sharing. However, grandfathered health plans must comply with certain other consumer protections in the Affordable Care Act, for example, the elimination of lifetime limi ts on benefits. Questions regarding which protections apply and which protections do not apply to a grandfathered health plan and what might cause a plan to change from grandfathered health plan status can be directed to the plan administrator. 7 Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 Notice Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (CAA) The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (CAA) is a federal law that includes the No Surprises Act as well the Provider transparency requirements that are descr ibed below. Surprise Billing Claims Surprise Billing Claims are claims that are subject to the No Surprises Act requirements: Emergency Services provided by Out -of-Network Providers, Covered Services provided by an Out -of-Network Provider at an In -Network Facility, and Out-of-Network Air Ambulance Services. No Surprise s Act Requirements Emergency Services As required by the CAA, Emergency Services are covered under your Plan: Without the need for Precertification Whether the Provider is In -Network or Out-of-Network If the Emergency Services you received are provided by an Out -of-Network Provider, Covered Services will be processed at the In -Network benefit level. Note that if you receive Emergency Services from an Out -of-Network Provider, your Out -of-Pocket costs will be limited to amounts that would apply if the Covered Services had been furnished by an In -Network Provider. However, Out -of-Network cost-shares (i.e., Copayments, Deductibles and/or Coinsurance) will apply to your claim if the treating Ou t-of-Network Provider determines you are stable, meaning you have been provided necessary Emergency Care such that your condition will not materially worsen and the Out -of-Network Provider determines: (i) that you are able to travel to an In -Network Facili ty by non -emergency transport; (ii) the Out -of-Network Provider complies with the notice and consent requirement; and (iii) you are in condition to receive the information and provide informed consent. If you continue to receive services from the Out-of-Network Provider after you are stabilized, you will be responsible for the Out -of-Network cost -shares, and the Out - of-Network Provider will also be able to charge you any difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out -of- Network Provider's bille d charges. This notice and consent exception does not apply if the Covered Services furnished by an Out -of-Network Provider result from unforeseen and urgent medical needs arising at the time of service. Out-of-Network Services Provided an In-Network Facility When you receive Covered Services from an Out -of-Network Provider at an In -Network Facility, your claims will be paid at the Out -of-Network benefit level if the Out -of-Network Provider gives you proper notice of its charges, and you giv e written consent to such charges. This means you will be responsible for Out -of-Network cost -shares for those services and the Out-of-Network Provider can also charge you any difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out -of- Network Provider's billed charges. This requirement does not apply to Ancillary Services. Ancillary Services are one of the following services: (a) Emergency Services; (b) anesthesiology; (c) laboratory and pathology services ; (d) radiology; (e) neonatology; (f) diagnostic services; (g) assistant surgeons; (h) Hospitalists; (i) Intensivists; and (j) any services set out by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. In addition, we will not apply this notice and consent process to you if we do not have an In -Network Pro vider in your area who can perform the services you require. Out-of-Network Providers satisfy the notice and consent requirement as follows: By obtaining your written consent not later than 72 hours prior to the delivery of services, or If the notice and c onsent is given on the date of the service, if you make an appointment within 72 hours of the services being delivered. How Cost -Shares are Calculated Your cost shares for Emergency Services or for Covered Services received by an Out -of-Network Provider at an In -Network Facility, will be calculated using the median Plan In -Network contract rate that we pay In -Network Providers for the geographic area where the Covered Service is provided. Any Out -of-Pocket cost shares you pay to an Out -of-Network Provider f or either Emergency Services or for Covered Services provided by an Out -of-Network Provider at an In -Network Facility will be applied to your In -Network Out -of-Pocket Limit. Appeals 8 If you receive Emergency Services from an Out -of-Network Provider , Covered Services from an Out -of-Network Provider at an In -Network Facility , or Out -of-Network Air Ambulance Services and believe those services are covered by the No Surprise s Act, you have the right to appeal that claim. If your appeal of a Surprise Billing Clai m is denied, then you have a right to appeal the adverse decision to an Independent Review Organization as set out in the \"Appeals and Complaints\" section of this Benefit Book. Provider Directories We are required to confirm the list of In -Network Provider s in our Provider Directory every 90 days. If you can show that you received inaccurate information from Us that a Provider was In -Network on a particular claim, then you will only be liable for In-Network cost shares (i.e., Copayment, Deductibles, and/or Coinsurance) for that claim. Your In -Network cost -shares will be calculated based upon the Maximum Allowed Amount . Transparency Requirements We provide the following information on our website (i.e., www.anthem.com ). Protections with respect to Surprise Billing Claims by Providers , including information on how to contact state and federal agencies if you believe a Provider has violated the No Surprises Act .

However, Federal law generally does not prohibit the mother's or newborn's attending Provider, after consulting with the mother, from discharging the mother or her newborn earlier than 48 hours (or 96 hours as applic able). In any case, plans and issuers may not, under Federal law, require that a provider obtain authorization from the Plan or the insurance issuer for prescribing a length of stay not in excess of 48 hours (or 96 hours). Statement of Rights under the Wom en's Cancer Rights Act of 1998 If you have had or are going to have a mastectomy, you may be entitled to certain benefits under the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 (WHCRA).

Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act provides for parity in the application of aggregate treatment limitations (day or visit limits) on mental health and substance abuse benefits with day or visit limits on medical and surgical ben efits. In general, group health plans offering mental health and substance abuse benefits cannot set day/visit limits on mental health or substance abuse benefits that are lower than any such day or visit limits for medical and surgical benefits. A plan that does not impose day or visit limits on medical and surgical benefits may not impose such day or visit limits on mental health and substance abuse benefits offered under the Plan.

Post -Doctoral Fellows, Vete rinary Interns and Clinical Psychology Interns Post-Doctoral Fellows, Veterinary Interns and Clinical Psychology Interns on appointments of half -time or greater are eligible for benefits as of the date of appointment unless otherwise noted . Dependents Although individuals may be eligible to participate in a University plan as a dependent they may not meet the definition of a qualified dependent for federal income tax purposes. If your dependent(s) meets the IRS test as a federal tax dependent he/she is considered a qualified dependent. If your dependent(s) does not meet the IRS test, he/she is considered a nonqualified dependent. There are tax consequences (imputed income) associated with providing coverage to individuals (domestic/civil union partner s and children of domestic/civil union partner s) not meeting the criteria of Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code which defines a federal tax dependent: Your Dependents may include the following: Legal spouse , the Subscriber's spouse, including the partne r to a civil union as recognized by law. For information on spousal eligibility please contact the Group. Common -law spouse, all references to spouse in this Booklet include a common -law spouse. A common -law spouse is an eligible Dependent who has a valid common -law marriage. This is the same as any other marriage and can only end by death or divorce. Same gender or opposite gender domestic partner . All references to spouse in this Booklet include a domestic partner. Domestic partner means a person of the same gender or opposite gender is the Subscriber's sole domestic partner; he or she is mentally competent; he or she is not related to the Subscriber by blood closer than permitted by the law for marriage; he or she is not married to anyone else; and he or she is financially interdependent with the Subscriber. Newborn child . A newborn child born to you or your spouse is covered under your coverage for the first 31 days of birth. If the newborn is your grandchil d, the newborn is usually not covered (see the Grandchild heading in this section). During the first 31 days after birth, a newborn child will be covered for Medically Necessary care. This includes well child care and treatment of medically diagnosed Conge nital Defects and Birth Abnormalities. This is regardless of the limitations and exclusions applicable to other conditions or procedures of this Booklet. All services during the first 31 days are subject to Cost Sharing and any benefit maximums that apply to other conditions. To keep the child's coverage beyond the 31 -day period, complete the Enrollment Change process to add the child. This must be completed within 30 days after the birth of the child to continue coverage. Adopted child . An unmarried child (who has not reached 18 years of age) adopted while you or your spouse is enrolled will be covered for 31 days after the date of placement for adoption. Placement for adoption means when a Subscriber has a legal obligation to partially or totally support a child in anticipation of the child's adoption. A placement ends when the legal obligation for support ends. To keep the adopted child's coverage beyond the 31 -day, you must complete the Enrollment Change process to add the adopted child. This must be comp leted within 30 days after the placement of the child for adoption to continue coverage for the 32nd day and thereafter. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 20 Dependent child . A child (including a stepchild or a disabled child) under 26 years of age may be covered under the terms of this Bookl et. Coverage stops at the end of the month in which the child turns 26. If you or your spouse have a qualified medical child support order for this child, the Dependent child is eligible for coverage, up to age 26, whether the child lives with you or your spouse. Disabled Dependent child . An unmarried child of any age who is medically certified as disabled , and dependent on the parent may be covered under the terms of this Booklet. The Dependent's disability must start before the end of the period they would become ineligible for coverage. The University requires the dependent to be certified as disabled prior to age 23, a qualified federal tax dependent and currently enrolled in the plan to maintain coverage. We must be informed of the Dependent's eligi bility for continuation of coverage within 30 days after the Dependent would normally become ineligible. You and the disabled Dependent's Doctor must send Us a Mentally or Physically Disabled Dependent Form. You may call Us or visit Our website to get such form. Grandchild . A grandchild of yours or your spouse is not eligible for coverage unless you or your spouse are the court - appointed permanent guardians or have adopted the grandchild. You must send the required application and proof of the court appoint ment or the legal adoption. One other option is to enroll the grandchild under an individual child -only plan, subject to its terms and conditions. Your group may have limited or excluded the eligibility of certain Dependent types and so not all Depend ents listed in this Plan may be entitled to enroll. For more specific information, please see Colorado State University Human Resources. Medicare -Eligible Members Before you turn 65, or if you qualify for Medicare in other ways, you should contact the local Social Security Administration office to establish Medicare eligibility. You should then contact Colorado State University Human Resources to talk about options. For details on how the benefits will be coordinated between Medicare and this plan, see the General Policy Provisions section. Enrollment Process This section lists who is eligible and what documents are needed for enrollment. Coverage starts on the Effective Date in Our files. No services before that date are covered. Note: Completing the required online enrollment process does not guarantee you get on the plan. Enrollment Process You must complete the Colorado State University online enrollment proc ess to add any Dependents. More forms may be needed for special Dependent status. You can get such forms from Colorado State University Human Resources, Our Member Services or Our website. Initial Enrollment Eligible employees may enroll for benefits for t hemselves and their eligible dependent s by completing the online enrollment process within 30 days after the date of eligibility as defined in the Colorado State University Summary Plan Description. Open Enrollment Any eligible employee w ho did not enroll when they were first eligible can enroll during Colorado State University's annual Open Enrollment Period. This period is held in November for a January 1 effective date of the following year. Eligible employees may enroll, cancel, waive, add, drop, or change coverage. Eligible employees may also add or delete individual members. The annual Open Enrollment Period is subject to all provisions of the Booklet. Colorado State University Human Resources can tell you more about the Open Enrollme nt Period. Newly Eligible Dependent Enrollment You may add a Dependent who becomes newly eligible due to a qualifying event. Qualifying events include marriage, birth, placement for adoption or issuance of a court order. To add the Dependent, the Enrollmen t Change process for the addition of the dependent must be completed within 30 days of the date of the event. Proof of the event, e.g., a copy of the marriage certificate or court order, must be submitted to Colorado State University Human Resources. When you or your spouse are required by a court or administrative order to cover an eligible Dependent for child support, the eligible Dependent must be enrolled within 30 days of the issuance of such order. Colorado State University Human Resources must recei ve a copy of the court or administrative order. If you do not add the eligible Dependent within 30 days of the issuance of the order, you must wait until the next open enrollment to add the Dependent. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 21 Special Enrollment Periods If a Subscriber or Dependent does not apply for coverage when they were first eligible, they may be able to join the plan prior to open enrollment if they qualify for special enrollment. Except as noted otherwise below, the Subscriber or Dependent must request special enrollment with in 30 days of a qualifying event. If an individual is notified or becomes aware of a qualifying event that will occur in the future, he or she may apply for coverage during the thirty (30) calendar days prior to the effective date of the qualifying event, with coverage beginning no earlier than the day the qualifying event occurs to avoid a gap in coverage. The individual must be able to provide written documentation to support the effective date of the triggering event at the time of appl ication. Special enrollment is available for eligible individuals who: Lost coverage due to death of a covered employee . Due to termination or reduction in number of hours of the employee's employment . The covered employee becomes ineligible for benefits under Title XVIII of the Federal Social Security Act, as amended . Lost coverage under a health benefit plan due to the divorce or legal separation of the covered employee's spouse or partner in civil union . Is now eligible for coverage due to marr iage (including a civil union where recognized in the state where the Subscriber resides), birth, adoption, placement for adoption, foster children placed for adoption . Pursuant to a QMCSO or other court or administrative order mandating that the individua l be covered . Termination of employment or eligibility for coverage, regardless of eligibility for COBRA . Has a reduction in the number of hours of employment . Due to involuntary termination of coverage . Has a reduction or elimination of group contribution s toward the cost of the prior health plan . Lost eligibility under any governmental medical assistance programs they were using . When the employee or dependent becomes eligible for a governmental medical assistance program. . A parent or legal guardian unen rolls a dependent, or a dependent becomes ineligible for the Children's Basic Health Plan. Important Notes about Special Enrollment: You must request coverage within 30 days of a qualifying event (e.g., marriage, birth of child etc.). The special enrollmen t period may be extended if the extension is required by law. If the Subscriber does not enroll themselves and/or their Dependents when first eligible or during a Special Enrollment period, they will not be eligible to enroll until the next Open Enrollment Period. Loss of State Medicaid Plan or State Child Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) - Loss of eligibility from a state Medicaid or SCHIP health plan is also a qualifying event for special enrollment for you or your Dependents. You must complete the online enrollment process within 60 days after coverage has ended. Also, special enrollment is allowed for the employee who becomes eligible for coverage assistance. This includes any waiver or demonstration project conducted under or in relation to these plans. Similarly, you must complete the enrollment change process within 60 days after the eligibility date for assistance is determined. Late Entrants If the Subscriber does not enroll themselves and/or their Dependents when first eligible or during a special e nrollment period, they will not be eligible to enroll until the next Open Enrollment Period. Military Service Employees going into or coming back from military service can keep this coverage. This choice is required by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). These rights apply only to employees and their Dependents covered under the plan before the employee leaves for military service: The longest period of coverage under this paragraph is the lesser of . - 24 months, starting on the date when the absence starts . - The day after the person was required to, but failed to, apply for or return to work. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 22 A person who opts to keep this coverage may be asked to pay up to 102% of the Amounts paid to maintain coverage. But those o n active duty for 30 days or less cannot be asked to pay more than the employee's share, if any, for the coverage. During a military leave covered by USERRA, the law requires Colorado State University to continue to give coverage under this Booklet to its Members. The coverage provided must be identical to the coverage provided to similarly situated, active employees and Dependents. This means that if the coverage for similarly situated, active employees and Dependents is modified, coverage for you (the ind ividual on military leave) will be modified. How to Change Coverage If a group provides you with multiple health care options, you may switch to another coverage offered by the group during open enrollment. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 23 HOW TO ACCESS YOUR SERVICES AND OBTAIN APPROVAL OF BENEFITS This is a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plan, which means you have In -Network (participating) and Out -of-Network (non-participating) benefits. This PPO coverage lets you choose how to use your benefits and control your out -of-pocket costs. When you get care from In-Network Providers, you receive the highest level of benefits at the lowest cost. The Schedule of Benefits lists payment levels for bo th In-Network and Out -of-Network care. We publish a directory of Participating Providers. You can get a directory from Us. You may call the Member Services number that is listed on your Health Benefit ID Card or you may write Us and ask that We send you a directory. You may also search for a Provider on -line at www.anthem.com . If you need details about a Provider's license or training, or help choosing a Doctor who is right for you, cal l the Member Services number on the back of your Health Benefit ID card. TTY/TDD services also are available by dialing 711. A special operator will get in touch with us to help with your needs. If you receive Covered Services from an Out -of-Network Provid er after We failed to provide you with accurate information on Our Provider directory, or after We failed to respond to your telephone or web -based inquiry within the time required by federal law, Covered Services will be covered at the In -Network level. You can access care from In -Network and Out -of-Network Providers without a referral. As well, no authorization or referral is needed for an OB/GYN and certified nurse midwife care. Providers Participating Providers (In -Network) Participating Providers have a network agreement with Us for this health benefit plan. Covered Services provided by a Participating Provider are considered In -Network. When you see a Participating Provider you have lower out -of-pocket costs. Your In -Network Cost Sharing for Participa ting Providers is on the Schedule of Benefits under the heading of In Network. You need to check to see if your Provider is a Participating Provider before your visit. To do that, you can check Our website or call Our Member Services. We do not guarantee t hat a Participating Provider will be available for all services and supplies covered under your PPO coverage. For some services and supplies, We may not have arrangements with Participating Providers. Please call Our Member Services for a list of the count ies where We may not have Participating Providers for such services and supplies. Sometimes you may need to travel a reasonable distance to get care from a Participating Provider. This does not apply if care is for an Emergency. If you choose to obtain the service from a non -Participating Provider rather than the Participating Provider, you will need to pay for any charges from the non -Participating Provider that are over Our Maximum Allowed Amount. The Maximum Allowed Amount is the most We will allow for a Covered Service. If We don't have a Participating Provider within a reasonable number of miles from your home for a Covered Service, you may be able to obtain an Authorized Service network exception to obtain care from a non -Participating Provider at the In- Network benefit level. If you want to get a network exception to receive coverage for a Covered Service from a non - Participating Provider at the In -Network level of benefits, you must call the Member Services to request this exception before getting the Covered Service from a non -Participating Provider. If approved, We will pay the non -Participating Provider at the In -Network level of benefits and you won't need to pay more for the services than if the services had been received from a Participating Prov ider. If you do not receive an Authorized Service network exception to obtain Covered Services from a non -Participating Provider, the claim will be processed using your Out -of-Network cost shares. Non-Participating Providers (Out -of-Network) Providers who have not signed a PPO Provider contract with Us are non -Participating Providers under this PPO plan. Services provided by a non -Participating Provider are considered Out -of-Network. When you see a non -Participating Provider you may have higher out -of-pocke t costs unless your claim involves a Surprise Billing Claim . In addition you must make sure any necessary Precertification/Prior Authorization is done, see Getting Approval of Benefits below for information. Your Out -of-Network Cost Sharing responsibilitie s for non -Participating Providers may be found on the Schedule of Benefits under the Out -of-Network heading. We will not deny or restrict Covered Services just because you get treatment from a non -Participating Provider; however, you may have to pay more. The Cost Sharing for Covered Services from a non -Participating Provider may be larger unless your claim involves a Surprise Billing Claim . Also, non -Participating Providers do not have to accept Our Maximum Allowed Amount as full payment. They can charge o r balance bill you for any amount of their bill which We do not pay. This balance billing cost is on top of, and does not count toward, your Cost Sharing obligation. We, on behalf of Colorado State University, pay the benefits of this Booklet directly to n on-Participating Providers, if you have authorized an assignment of benefits. An assignment of benefits means you want Us to pay the Provider instead of CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 24 you. We may require a copy of the assignment of benefits for Our records. These payments fulfill Our ob ligation to you for those services. Surprise Billing Claims Surprise Billing Claims are described in the \"Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 Notice\" at the beginning of this Booklet. Please refer to that section for further details. Connect with Us Us ing Our Mobile App As soon as you enroll in this Plan, you should download Our mobile app. You can find details on how to do this on Our website, www.anthem.com . Our goal is to make it easy for you to find answers to your questions. You can chat with Us live in the app, or contact Us on Our website, www.anthem.com , or through an Anthem -enabled device. Voluntary Clinic al Quality Programs We may offer additional opportunities to assist you in obtaining certain covered preventive or other care (e.g., well child check -ups or certain laboratory screening tests) that you have not received in the recommended timeframe. These opportunities are called voluntary clinical quality programs. They are designed to encourage you to get certain care when you need it and are separate from Covered Services under your plan. These programs are not guaranteed and could be discontinued at any time. We will give you the choice and if you choose to participate in one of these programs, and obtain the recommended care within the program's timeframe, you may receive incentives such as gift cards or retailer coupons, which We encou rage you to use for health and wellness related activities or items. Under other clinical quality programs, you may receive a home test kit that allows you to collect the specimen for certain covered laboratory tests at home and mail it to the laboratory f or processing. You may also be offered a home visit appointment to collect such specimens and complete biometric screenings. You may need to pay any cost shares that normally apply to such covered laboratory tests (e.g., those applicable to the laboratory processing fee) but will not need to pay for the home test kit or the home visit. If you have any questions about whether receipt of a gift card or retailer coupon results in taxable income to you, We recommend that you consult your tax advisor. Voluntary Wellness Incentive Programs We may offer health or fitness related program options for selection by your group to help you achieve your best health. These programs are not Covered Services under your plan, but are separate components, which are not guaranteed under your plan and could be discontinued at any time. If your group has selected one of these options to make available to all employees, you may receive incentives such as gift cards by participating in or completing such voluntary wellness promotion programs as health assessments, weight management or tobacco cessation coaching. Under other options a group may select, you may receive such incentives by achieving specified standards based on health factors under wellness programs that comply wi th applicable law. If you think you might be unable to meet the standard, you might qualify for an opportunity to earn the same reward by a different means. You may contact Us at the Member Services number on your Health Benefit ID Card and We will work wi th you (and, if you wish, your Doctor) to find a wellness program with the same reward that is right for you in light of your health status. (If you receive a gift card as a wellness reward and use it for purposes other than for qualified medical expenses, this may result in taxable income to you. For additional guidance, please consult your tax advisor.) Program Incentives We may offer incentives from time to time at our discretion in order to introduce you to covered programs and services available under this Plan. The purpose of these incentives include, but is not limited to, making you aware of cost effective benefit options or services, helping you achieve your best health, and encouraging you to update member -related information. These incentives may be offered in various forms such as retailer coupons, gift cards, health related merchandise, and discounts on fees or Member cost shares. Acceptance of these incentives is voluntary as long as Anthem offers the incentives program. We may discontinue an in centive for a particular covered program or service at any time. If you have any questions about whether receipt of an incentive or retailer coupon results in taxable income to you, We recommend that you consult your tax advisor. Continuity of Care If a Pa rticipating Provider leaves Our network for any reason other than termination for cause, and you are in active treatment, you may be able to continue seeing that Provider for a limited period of time and still get In -Network benefits. \"Active treatment\" i ncludes : 1) An ongoing course of treatment for a life -threatening condition . CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 25 2) An ongoing course of treatment for a serious acute condition , (examples include chemotherapy, radiation therapy and post-operative visits) . 3) The second or third trimester of pregnanc y and through the postpartum period . 4) An ongoing course of treatment for a health condition for which the Physician or health care Provider attests that discontinuing care by the current Physician or Provider would worsen your condition or interfere with an ticipated outcomes. An \"ongoing course of treatment\" includes treatments for mental health and substance use disorders. In these cases, you may be able to continue seeing that Provider for up to 90 days. If treatment is not complete at the end of 90 days, you may, depending on the condition be entitled to a longer period as allowed by law. If you wish to continue seeing the same Provider, you or your Doctor should contact Member Services for details. Any decision by Us regarding a request for Continuity of Care is subject to the appeals process. The BlueCard Program Like all Blue Cross & Blue Shield plans throughout the country, We participate in a program called \"BlueCard\", which provides services to you when you are outside our Service Area. For more details on this program, please see \" Inter-Plan Arrangements\" in the \"Claims Procedure (How to File a Claim)\" section. Getting Approval for Benefits We include the process of Utilization Review to decide when services are Medically Necessary or Experimental/Investigational as those terms are defined in this Booklet . Utilization Review aids the delivery of cost -effective health care by reviewing the use of treatments and, when proper, level of care and/or the setting or place of service that they are performed. Reviewing Where Services are Provided A service must be Medically Necessary to be a Covered Service. When level of care, setting or place of service is reviewed, services that can be safely given to you in a lower level of care or lower cost setting/place of care, will not be Medically Necessary if they are given in a higher level of care, or higher cost setting/place of care. This means that a request for a service may be denied because it is not Medically Necessary for the service to b e provided where it is being requested. When this happens the service can be requested again in another place and will be reviewed again for Medical Necessity. At times a different Provider or Facility may need to be used in order for the service to be con sidered Medically Necessary. Examples include, but are not limited to: A service may be denied on an inpatient basis at a Hospital but may be approvable if provided on an outpatient basis at a Hospital. A service may be denied on an outpatient basis at a Hospital but may be approvable at a free standing imaging center, infusion center, Ambulatory Surgery Center, or in a Physician's office. A service may be denied at a Skilled Nursing Facility but may be approvable in a home setting. Utilization Review crit eria will be based on many sources including medical policy and clinical guidelines. We may decide that a treatment that was asked for is not Medically Necessary if a clinically equivalent treatment that is more cost effecti ve is available and appropriate . \"Clinically equivalent\" means treatments that for most Members, will give you similar results for a disease or condition. If you have any questions about the Utilization Review process, the medical policies, or clinical guidelines, you may call th e membe r service phone number on the back of your Health Benefit ID Card. Coverage for or payment of the service or treatment reviewed is not guaranteed even if We decide your services are Medically Necessary. For benefits to be covered, We may consider on the da te you get service : 1. You must be eligible for benefits . 2. Payment required to maintain coverage must be paid for the time period that services are given . 3. The service or supply must be the same as was precertified . 4. The service or supply must be for the same condition and setting that was precertified . 5. You must not have exceeded any applicable limits under your coverage. Types of Reviews Pre-service Review - A review of a service, treatment or admission for a coverage determination which is done before the service or treatment begins or admission date. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 26 Precertification - A required Pre -service Review for a benefit coverage determination for a service or treatment. Certain services require Precertification in order for you to get benefits. The bene fit coverage review will include a review to decide whether the service meets the definition of Medical Necessity or is Experimental/Investigational as those terms are defined in this Booklet. For emergency services, Precertification is not required. For a dmissions following Emergency Care, you, your authorized representative or Doctor must tell us within 72 hours of the admission or as soon as possible within a reasonable period of time. For childbirth admissions, Precertification is not needed unless the admission lasts beyond the first 48 hours for a vaginal delivery or 96 hours for a cesarean delivery, or if the baby is not sent home at the same time as the mother. Continued Stay/Concurrent Review - A Utilization Review of a service, treatment or admissi on for a benefit coverage determination which must be done during an ongoing stay in a Facility or course of treatment. Both Pre -Service and Continued Stay/Concurrent Reviews may be considered on an urgent or expedited timeframe when, in the view of the tr eating Provider or any Doctor with knowledge of your medical condition, without such care or treatment, your life or health or your ability to regain maximum function could be seriously threatened or you could be subjected to severe pain that cannot be ade quately managed without such care or treatment, or if you have a physical or mental disability, would create an imminent and substantial limitation on your existing ability to live independently. Urgent reviews are conducted under a shorter timeframe than standard reviews. Post Service Clinical Claims Review - A review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage that is conducted after the service has been provided. Post -service reviews are performed when a service, treatment or admission di d not need a Precertification, or when a needed Precertification was not obtained. Post -service reviews are done for a service, treatment or admission in which We have a related clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by Us. Who is Responsi ble for Precertification? Typically, In -Network Providers know which services need Precertification and will get any Precertification when needed. Your Primary Care Physician and other In -Network Providers have been given detailed information about these procedures in Colorado and are responsible for meeting these requirements. Generally, the ordering Provider, Facility or attending Doctor (\"requesting Provider\") will get in touch with Us to ask for a Precertification. However, you may request a Precertifi cation or you may choose an authorized representative to act on your behalf for a specific request. The authorized representative can be anyone who is 18 years of age or older. The table below outlines who is responsible for Precertificatio n and under what circumstances. To get more information on what services need Precertification, you or your representative may call Member Services. Provider Network Status Responsibility to Get Precertification Comments In Network Provider The Colorado Provider must get Precertification when required Out of Network/ Non-Participating Member You must get Precertification when required . (Call Member Services.) You may be financially responsible for charges/costs related to the service and/or setting in whole or in part if the service and or setting is found to not be Medically Necessary. Blue Card Provider Member (Except for Inpatient Admissions) You must get Precertification when required . (Call Member Services.) You may be financially responsible for charges/costs related to the service and/or setting in whole or in part if the service and or setting is found to not be Medically Necessary. Blue Card Provi ders must obtain Precertification for all Inpatient Admissions. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 27 Provider Network Status Responsibility to Get Precertification Comments NOTE: For an Emergency Care admission, Precertification is not required. However, you, your authorized representative or Doctor must tell Us within 72 hours of the admission or as soon as possible within a reasonable period of time. How Decisions are Made We use our clinical coverage guidelines, such as medical plan, clinical guidelines, and other applicable policies and procedures to help make Our Medical Necessity decisions. This includ es decisions about Prescription Drugs as detailed in the section \"Prescription Drugs Administered by a Medical Provider\". Medical policies and clinical guidelines reflect the standards of practice and medical interventions identified as proper medical prac tice. We reserve the right to review and update these clinical coverage guidelines from time to time. You are entitled to ask for and get, free of charge, reasonable access to any records concerning your request. To ask for this information, call the Prece rtification phone number on the back of your Health Benefit ID Card. If you are not satisfied with Our decision under this section of your benefits, please refer to the \"Appeals and Complaints\" section to see what rights may be available to you. Decision a nd Notice Requirements We will review requests for benefits according to the timeframes listed below. The timeframes and requirements listed are based on applicable laws. Where applicable laws are stricter than federal laws, we will follow applicable laws. If you live in and/or get services in a state other than the state where your contract was issued other state -specific requirements may apply. You may call the phone number on the back of your Health Benefit ID Card for more details. Type of Review Timeframe Requirement for Decision and Notification Expedited Pre -service Review 72 hours from the receipt of request Non-expedited Pre -service Review 15 calendar days from the receipt of the request Expedited Continued Stay/Concurrent Review when reque st is received more than 24 hours before the end of the previous authorization 24 hours from the receipt of the request Expedited Continued Stay/Concurrent Review when request is received less than 24 hours before the end of the previous authorization or no previous authorization exists 72 hours from the receipt of the request Non-expedited Continued Stay/Concurrent Review for ongoing outpatient treatment 15 calendar days from the receipt of the request Post-Service Review 30 calendar days from the receipt of the request If more information is needed to make Our decision, We will tell the requesting Provider of the specific information needed to finish the review. If We do not get the specific information We need by the required timeframe, We will make a decision based upon the information We have. We will notify you and your Provider of Our decision as required by applicable law. Notice may be given by one or more the following methods: verbal, written, and/or electronic. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 28 Important Information We m ay, from time to time, waive, enhance, change or end certain medical management processes (including utilization management, case management, and disease management) and/or offer an alternate benefit if in Our sole discretion, such change furthers the prov ision of cost effective, value based and/or quality services. We may also select certain qualifying Providers to take part in a program or a provider arrangement that exempts them from certain procedural or medical management processes that would otherwise apply. We may also exempt your claim from medical review if certain conditions apply. Just because We exempt a process, Provider or Claim from the standards which otherwise would apply, it does not mean that We will do so in the future, or will do so in t he future for any other Provider, claim or Member. We may stop or change any such exemption with or without advance notice. You may find out whether a Provider is taking part in certain programs or a Provider arrangement by checking your on-line Provider D irectory, on -line pre -certification list or contacting the Member Services number on the back of your Health Benefit ID Card.

We may cover one form of administration instead of another, or put other forms of administration in a different tier. Prescription Drugs will always be dispensed as ordered by your Doctor and by applicable state ph armacy regulations . You may ask for, or your Doctor may order, the Brand Name Drug. However, if a Generic Drug is available, you will have to pay the difference in the cost between the Generic Drug and Brand Name Drug, as well as your Tier 1/Generic Copaym ent/Coinsurance. Prescription Drug List We also have an Anthem Prescription Drug list, (a formulary), which is a list of Drugs that have been reviewed and recommended for use based on their quality and cost effectiveness. Benefits may not be covered for certain Drugs if they are not on the Prescription Drug list. The Drug List is developed by us based upon clinical findings, and where proper, the cost of the Drug relative to other Drugs in its therapeutic class or used to treat the same or similar conditi on. It is also based on the availability of over the counter medicines, Generic Drugs, the use of one Drug over another by our Members, and where proper, certain clinical economic reasons. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 51 We retain the right, at our discretion, to decide coverage based up on medication dosage, dosage forms, manufacturer, and administration methods (i.e., oral, injection, topical, or inhaled) and may cover one form instead of another as Medically Necessary. You may request a copy of the covered Prescription Drug list by call ing the Pharmacy member services telephone number on the back of your Health Benefit ID Card or visiting our website at www.anthem.com . The covered Prescription Drug list is subject to periodic review and amendment. Inclusion of a Drug or related item on the covered Prescription Drug list is not a guarantee of coverage. Exception Request for a Drug not on the Prescription Drug List If you, your designee or your Doctor believes you need a Prescription Drug that is not on the Prescription Drug List, please have your Doctor or pharmacist get in touch with us. We will cover the other Prescription Drug throug h a special exception process, but only if we agree that it is Medically Necessary and appropriate over the other Drugs that are on the List.

If we approve the coverage of the Drug, coverage of the Drug will be provided for the duration of your prescription, including refills. If we deny coverage of the Drug, you have the right to appeal, including the right to request indepe ndent external review, as explained in the \"Appeals and Complaints\" section of this Booklet . You, your designee or your Doctor may also submit a request for a Prescription Drug that is not on the Prescription Drug List based on exigent circumstances. Exige nt circumstances exist if you are suffering from a health condition that may seriously jeopardize your life, health, or ability to regain maximum function, or if you are undergoing a current course of treatment using a drug not covered by the Plan.

Additional Features of Your Prescription Drug Pharmacy Benefit Day Supply and Refill Limits Certain day supply limits apply to Prescription Drugs as listed in the Schedule of Benefit s. In most cases, you must use a certain amount of your prescription before it can be refilled. In some cases We may let you get an early refill. For example, We may let you refill your prescription early if it is decided that you need a larger dose. Early refills may also be available for Prescription Eye Drops. In addition one additional bottle may be available for Prescription Eye Drops, if the bottle is requested at the time of the original prescription is filled, and is needed for use by a day car e center or school. Prescription Eye Drops means a liquid prescription drug which is applied directly to the eye from a bottle or by means of a dropper, or as defined by Colorado law. We will work with the Pharmacy to decide when this should happen. If you are going on vacation and you need more than the day supply allowed, you should ask your pharmacist to call Our PBM and ask for an override for one early refill. If you need more than one early refill, please call pharmacy member services at the number on the back of your Health Benefit ID Card.

Please note that Anthem may increase the cost share listed in the Schedule of Benefits in order to take full advantage of cost share assistance that is available from drug manufacturers. This will lower plan costs but will not increase your cost share obligation because if you take advantage of this assista nce any additional cost share will be offset by the cost share assistance . Special Programs Except when prohibited by federal regulations (such as HSA rules), from time to time We may offer programs to support the use of more cost -effective or clinically e ffective Prescription Drugs including Generic Drugs, Home Delivery Drugs, over the counter Drugs or preferred products. Such programs may reduce or waive Copayments or Coinsurance for a limited time. We may stop a program at any time.

CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 62 MEMBER PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY Cost Sharing Requirements Cost Sharing is how We share the cost of health care services with you. It means what We are responsible for paying and what you are responsible for paying. You mee t your Cost Sharing requirements through your payment of Copayments, Deductibles and Coinsurance (as described below). How much you have to pay depends on the choices you make of Providers. For example, if you choose to use a participating Provider or part icipating facility, your out -of-pocket costs may be less than if you choose a non -participating Provider or non -participating facility. Your Cost Sharing requirements are based on the Maximum Allowed Amount. We work with Doctors, Hospitals, pharmacies and other health care Providers to control health care costs. As part of this effort, most Providers who contract with Us agree to control costs by giving discounts to Us. Most other insurers maintain similar arrangements with Provide rs. In their contracts, In -Network Providers agree to accept Our Maximum Allowed Amount as payment in full for Covered Services. We determine a Maximum Allowed Amount for all procedures performed by Providers. The contracts between Us and Our In -Network Pr oviders include a hold harmless clause which provides that you cannot be responsible to the Provider for claims owed by Us for health care services covered under this Booklet. Non -Participating Providers do not have that rule. They can charge or balance bi ll you for any amount of their bill which We do not pay. This balance billing cost can be large, and is on top of, and does not count toward, your Cost Sharing obligation. Maximum Allowed Amount This section describes how We determine what We, on behalf of the Colorado State University, pay for Covered Services. Reimbursement of Covered Services given to you by a participating and non -Participating Provider is based on your plan's Maximum Allowed Amount for the Covered Service that you receive. Please see I nter-Plan Programs in the Claims Procedure (How to File a Claim) and the BlueCard\u00ae Program in the How to Access Your Services and Obtain Approval of Benefits sections for more information. The Maximum Allowed Amount for this plan is the maximum amount of r eimbursement We will allow for services and supplies: that meet Our definition of Covered Services, to the extent such services and supplies are covered under this Booklet and are not excluded . that are Medically Necessary . that are provided with all appli cable Precertification/Prior Authorization, utilization management or other requirements in this Booklet. You will be required to pay a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount if you have not yet met your Deductible or have a Copayment or Coinsurance. In add ition, or under Surprise Billing Claims* when you receive Covered Services from an Out - of-Network Provider, you may be responsible for paying any difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Provider's actual charges. This amount can be large. *Surprise Billing Claims are described in the \"Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 Notice\" at the beginning of this Booklet. Please refer to that section for further details. When you receive Covered Services from a Provider, We will, to the ex tent applicable, apply claim processing rules to the claim submitted for those Covered Services. These rules evaluate the claim information and, among other things, determine the accuracy and appropriateness of the procedure and diagnosis codes included in the claim. Applying these rules may affect Our determination of the Maximum Allowed Amount. Our application of these rules does not mean that the Covered Services you receive were not Medically Necessary. It means We have determined that the claim was sub mitted inconsistent with procedure coding rules and/or reimbursement policies. For example, your Provider may have submitted the claim using several procedure codes when there is a single procedure code that includes all of the procedures that were perform ed. When this happens, the Maximum Allowed Amount will be based on the single procedure code rather than a separate Maximum Allowed Amount for each billed code. Likewise, when multiple procedures are performed on the same day by the same Doctor or other Pr ovider, We may reduce the Maximum Allowed Amounts for those secondary and later procedures because reimbursement at 100% of the Maximum Allowed Amount for those procedures would represent duplicative payment for parts of the primary procedure that may be considered incidental or inclusive. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 63 Provider Network Status The Maximum Allowed Amount may vary depending upon whether the Provider is participating or non -participating. A Participating Provider is a Provider who is in the Provider network for this specific health benefits plan. For Covered Services performed by a Participating Provider, the Maximum Allowed Amount for this plan is the rate the Provider has agreed with Us t o accept as reimbursement for the Covered Services. Because Participating Providers have agreed to accept the Maximum Allowed Amount as payment in full for those Covered Services, they should not send you a bill or collect for amounts above the Maximum All owed Amount. However, you may receive a bill or be asked to pay all or a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount if you have not yet met your Deductible or have a Copayment or Coinsurance. Please call Member Services for help in finding a Participating Provi der or visit www.anthem.com . Providers who have not entered into a PPO Provider contract with Us are non -Participating Providers and are not in any of Our networks subject to Blue Cros s Blue Shield Association rules governing claims filed by certain ancillary providers. 1. Except for Surprise Billing Claims, We will calculate the Maximum Allowed Amount for Covered Services you receive from an Out -of-Network Provider using one of the follow ing An amount based on Our non -Participating Provider fee schedule/rate, which We have established at Our discretion, and which We may modify from time -to-time, after considering one or more of the following: reimbursement amounts accepted by like/similar Providers contracted with Us, reimbursement amounts paid by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for the same services or supplies, and other industry cost, reimbursement and utilization data . 2. An amount based on reimbursement or cost inform ation from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). When basing the Maximum Allowed Amount upon the level or method of reimbursement used by CMS, We will update such information, which is unadjusted for geographic locality, no less than annual ly. 3. An amount based on information provided by a third party vendor, which may reflect one or more of the following factors: (1) the complexity or severity of treatment; (2) level of skill and experience required for the treatment; or (3) comparable Providers' fees and costs to deliver care . 4. An amount negotiated by Us or a third party vendor which has been agreed to by the Provider. This may include rates for services coordinated through Care Management . 5. An amount based on or derived from the total charges billed by the non -Participating Provider. Providers who are not contracted for this product, but are contracted for other products with Us are also considered Out -of-Network. For this Booklet, the Maximum Allowed Amount for services from t hese Providers will be one of the five methods shown above unless the contract between Us and that Provider specifies a different amount or if your claim involves a Surprise Billing Claim . For Covered Services rendered outside Our Service Area by Out -of-Network Providers, claims may be priced using the local Blue Cross Blue Shield plan's Non -Participating Provider fee schedule/rate or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state or federal law. In certain situations, the Maximum Allowed Amount for out of areas claims may be based on billed charges, the pricing We would use if the healthcare services has been obtained within Our Service Area, or a special negotiate price. Except when you get Covered Services from an Out -of-Network Provider at an In -Network Facility in Colorado (and you did not knowingly choose the Out -of-Network Provider), or except when you get Covered Emergency Services from an Out -of- Network Provider at a Facility in Colorado, or unless your claim involves a Surprise Bil ling Claim, an Out -of-Network Provider may send you a bill and collect for the amount of the Provider's charge that exceeds Our Maximum Allowed Amount. You are responsible for paying the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the amount the Pro vider charges. This \"balance billing\" amount can be large. Choosing an In -Network Provider will likely result in lower out of pocket costs to you. Please call member services for help in finding a participating Provider or visit Our website at www.anthe m.com. Member Services is also available to assist you in determining your plan's Maximum Allowed Amount for a particular service from a non -Participating Provider. In order for Us to assist you, you will need to get from your Provider the specific procedu re code(s) and diagnosis code(s) for the services they will give you. You will also need to know the Provider's charges to calculate your out of pocket responsibility. Although Member Services can assist you with this pre -service information, the final Max imum Allowed Amount for your claim will be based on the actual claim submitted by the Provider. For Prescription Drugs, the Maximum Allowed Amount is the amount determined by us using Prescription Drug cost information provided by the Pharmacy Benefits Man ager (PBM). CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 64 Member Cost Share For certain Covered Services, and depending on your health benefits plan, you may be required to pay a part of the Maximum Allowed Amount as your cost share amount. For example you would need to pay for your Deductible, Copaym ent, and/or Coinsurance. Your cost share amount and out -of-pocket limits may vary depending on whether you receive services from a participating Provider or non -participating Provider. This means you may be required to pay higher cost share amounts or may have limits on your benef its when using non -participating Providers. Please see the Schedule of Benefits for your cost share amounts and limitations. You can also call Member Services to find out your health benefit coverage or cost share amounts which can vary by the type of Prov ider you use. We will not pay for services that are not covered by this Booklet. You may be responsible for the total amount billed by your Provider for non -Covered Services. It doesn't matter if the services are performed by a participating Provider or no n- participating Provider. Non -Covered Services include services specifically excluded from coverage by the terms of this Booklet and services received after benefits have been exhausted. Benefits may be exhausted by exceeding, for example, the lifetime max imum, benefit caps or day/visit limits. When you receive Covered Services for Emergency Care, usually the most you can be billed is your Plan's In -Network cost - sharing amounts, which are Copayments, Deductibles, and/or Coinsurance. You cannot be balanced -billed for any other amount. This includes both the Emergency Facility and any providers you may see for Emergency Care. You have the right to request that In -Network Providers perform all Covered Services. If you receive Covered Services in an In -Network P rovider Facility in Colorado from an Out -of-Network Provider, such as a radiologist, anesthesiologist or pathologist, and you did not knowingly choose the Out -of-Network Provider, you will pay the In -Network cost sharing levels for those Covered Services a nd will not have to pay the difference between the Out -of-Network Provider's charges and the Maximum Allowable Amount. The Facility must tell you if you are at an Out -of-Network or at an In -Network location that is using Out -of-Network Providers. The Facil ity must also tell you what types of services may be provided by any Out -of- Network Provider. The following are examples for illustrative purposes only; the amounts shown may be different than this Booklet's cost share amounts; see your \"Schedule of Bene fits (Who Pays What)\" for your applicable amounts. Example: Your coverage has a Coinsurance cost share of 20% for In -Network services, and 30% for Out -of-Network services after the In -Network or Out -of-Network Deductible has been met. You choose an In -Network surgeon. The charge was $2500. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the surgery is $1500; your Coinsurance responsibility when an In -Network surgeon is used is 20% of $1500, or $300. We allow 80% of $1500, or $1200. The In -Network surgeon accepts the t otal of $1500 as reimbursement for the surgery regardless of the charges. Your total out of pocket responsibility would be $300. You choose an Out -of-Network surgeon. The Out -of-Network surgeon's charge for the service is $2500. The Maximum Allowed Amoun t for the surgery service is $1500; your Coinsurance responsibility for the Out -of-Network surgeon is 30% of $1500, or $450 after the Out -of-Network Deductible has been met. We allow the remaining 70% of $1500, or $1050. In addition, the Out -of-Network s urgeon could bill you the difference between $2500 and $1500, so your total Out of Pocket charge would be $450 plus an additional $1000, for a total of $1450. Under certain events, if We pay the Provider amounts that are your responsibility, such as Deductibles, Copayments or Coinsurance, We may get those amounts back from you. You agree that We have the right to collect such amounts from you. Authorized Services In some cases, such as where there is no In -Network or Participating Provider available for the Covered Service, We may authorize the In -Network Cost Sharing amounts (Deductible, Copayment, and/or Coinsurance) to apply to a claim for a Covered Service you get from a non -Participating Provider. In such circumstance, you must contact Us in advance of getting the Covered Service. Please contact Member Services to request authorization. Federal/State Taxes/Surcharges/Fees Federal or state laws or regulations may require a surcharge, tax or other fee. If applicable, we will include any such surcharge, tax or other fee as part of the claim charge passed on to you. Claims Review We have processes to review claims before and after payment to detect fraud, waste, abuse and other inappropriate activity. When you seek services from Out -of-Netw ork Providers you could be balanced billed by the Out -of-Network Provider for those services that are determined to be not payable as a result of these review processes. A claim may also be determined CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 65 to be not payable due to a Provider's failure to submit medical records with the claims that are under review in these processes. Deductible A Deductible is a set dollar amount for Covered Services that you must pay within your Benefit Period before We, on behalf of the Colorado State University, pay for Cover ed Services. The Deductible amount is listed in the Schedule of Benefits . In addition to the medical Deductible, there may be a separate Deductible required for Prescription Drug Covered Services each Benefit Period. The Deductible amount is listed on the Schedule of Benefits . Each Member must meet a separate Deductible. A new Deductible is required for each Benefit Period. Family Deductible - The family Deductible is a combined Deductible. This means any combination of amounts paid by family Members toward Covered Services can be used to satisfy The family Deductible. One person may not contribute more than the individual Deductible toward t he family Deductible. The family Deductible is also applicable for newborn and adopted children (and for all other family Members) for the first 31-day period following birth or adoption if the child is enrolled or not enrolled the 31 -day period Out-of-Pocket Annual Maximum You must first meet your annual Deductibles, if applicable. After the Deductible is met you pay a percentage of charges for Covered Services as listed on the Schedule of Benefits . This percentage is called Coinsurance. You pay the Coinsurance percentage for Covered Services until the Out -of-Pocket Annual Maximum is reached for your Benefit Period. Once the Out -of-Pocket Annual Maximum is reached, We pay 100 percent of any remaining eligible charges for the rest of your Benefit Period. In -Network and Out -of-Network Coinsurance amounts are separate and do not apply toward each other. You will always be responsible for the difference between Billed Charges and the Maximum Allowed Amount for non -participating Providers, even after r eaching the Out -of-Pocket Annual Maximum for Out -of-Network services. The difference between Billed Charges and the Maximum Allowed Amount for non -participating Providers does not apply towards your Out -of-Pocket Annual Maximum. The O ut-of-Pocket Annual Maximum is designed to protect you from catastrophic health care costs. Deductible(s), Coinsurance and Copayments are included in the Out -of-Pocket Annual Maximum. Once you and/or your family have satisfied the Out -of-Pocket Annual Maxi mum, no additional Deductible, Coinsurance, or Copayments will be required for you and/or your family for the rest of the Benefit Period. The Out -of-Pocket Annual maximum is found on the Schedule of Benefits . Family Out -of-Pocket Annual Maximum - The family Out -of-Pocket Annual Maximum is a combined Out -of-Pocket Annual Maximum. This means any combination of amounts paid by family Members toward Covered Services can be used to satisfy the family Out -of-Pocket Annual Maximum. One person may not co ntribute more than the individual Out -of-Pocket Annual Maximum toward the family Out -of-Pocket Annual Maximum. The Family Membership Out -of-Pocket Annual Maximum is also applicable for newborn and adopted children for the first 31-day period following birt h or adoption if the child is enrolled or not enrolled following the 31 -day period. Benefit Period Maximum Some Covered Services have a maximum benefit of days, visits or dollar amounts that We will allow during a Benefit Period. When the Deductible is app lied to a Covered Service that has a maximum benefit of days or visits, the maximum benefits may be reduced by the amount applied to the Deductible, whether or not the Covered Service is paid by Us. These maximums apply even if you have satisfied the appli cable Out -of-Pocket Annual Maximum. See the Schedule of Benefits for those services which have a Benefit Period Maximum. If you leave this plan, and go on to a new plan with Us in the same Benefit Period, all covered benefits that have a Benefit Period maximum or lifetime maximum will be carried over to the new plan. For instance, if a benefit has a limit of one visit per Benefit Period and you received that benefit under the prior coverage, then you are not eligible under the new plan for the sam e benefit until the Benefit Period ends, as benefits have been exhausted for your Benefit Period. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 66 CLAIMS PROCEDURE (How to File a Claim) Notice of Claim & Proof of Loss After you get Covered Services, We must receive written notice of your claim in order for benefits to be paid. In-Network Providers will submit claims for you. They are responsible for ensuring that claims have the information We need to determine benefits. If the claim does not include enough information, We will ask them for more details, and they will be required to supply those details within certain timeframes. Out-of-Network claims can be submitted by the Provider if the Provider is willing to file on your behalf. However, if the Provider is not submitting on your behalf, you will be r equired to submit the claim. Claim forms are usually available from the Provider. If they do not have a claim form, you can send a written request to Us, or contact member services and ask for a claim form to be sent to you. If you do not receive the claim form, you can still submit written notice of the claim without the claim form. The same information that would be given on the claim form must be included in the written notice of claim, including: \u00ad Name of patient \u00ad Patient's relationship with the Subscribe r \u00ad Identification number \u00ad Date, type, and place of service \u00ad Your signature and the Provider's signature Out-of-Network claims must be submitted within 180 days . In certain cases, state or federal law may allow additional time to file a claim, if you could not reasonably file within the 180-day period. The claim must have the information We need to determine benefits. If the claim does not include enough informa tion, We will ask you for more details and inform you of the time by which We need to receive that information. Once We receive the required information, We will process the claim according to the terms of your Plan. Please note that failure to submit the information We need by the time listed in Our request could result in the denial of your claim, unless state or federal law requires an extension. Please contact Member Services if you have any questions or concerns about how to submit claims. Payment of B enefits You authorize Us to make payments directly to Providers for Covered Services. In no event, however, shall Our right to make payments directly to a Provider be deemed to suggest that any Provider is a beneficiary with independent claims and appeal rights under this coverage. Where permitted by applicable law, We reserve the right to make payments directly to you as opposed to any Provider for Covered Service, at Our discretion. In the event that payment is made directly to you, you have the respon sibility to apply this payment to the claim from the Out -of-Network Provider. Payments and notice regarding the receipt and/or adjudication of claims may also be sent to an Alternate Recipient (which is defined herein as any child of a Subscriber who is re cognized under a \"Qualified Medical Child Support Order\" as having a right to enrollment under the Group's Plan), or that person's custodial parent or designated representative. Any payments made by Us (whether to any Provider for Covered Service or you) will discharge our obligation for Covered Services. You cannot assign your right to receive payment to anyone, except as required by a \"Qualified Medical Child Support Order\" as defined by, and if subject to, ERISA or any applicable Federal law. Once a Pr ovider performs a Covered Service, We will not honor a request for Us to withhold payment of the claims submitted. The coverage, rights, and benefits are not assignable by any Member without Our written consent, except as provided above. This prohibition against assignment includes rights to receive payment, claim benefits under this coverage and/or law, sue or otherwise begin legal action, or request documents or any other information that a Participant or beneficiary may request under ERISA. Any assignm ent made without written consent will be void and unenforceable. Right of Recovery and Adjustment - Whenever payment has been made in error, We will have the right to recover such payment from you or, if applicable, the Provider or otherwise make appropria te adjustment to claims. In most instances such recovery or adjustment activity shall be limited to the calendar year in which the error is discovered. We have oversight responsibility for compliance with Provider and vendor contracts. We may enter into a settlement or compromise regarding enforcement of these contracts and may retain any recoveries made from a Provider or vendor resulting from these aud its if the return of the overpayment is not feasible. Additionally, We have established recovery and adjustment policies to determine which recoveries and adjustments are to be pursued, when to incur costs and expenses and settle or compromise recovery or adjustment amounts. We will not pursue recoveries for overpayments or adjustments for underpayments if the cost of the activity exceeds the overpayment or underpayment amount. We reserve the right to CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 67 deduct or offset including cross plan offsetting on In-Network claims and on Out -of-Network claims where the Out -of- Network Provider agrees to cross plan offsetting, any amounts paid in error from any pending or future claim. Inter -Plan Arrangements Out-of-Area Services Overview We have a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees. Generally, these relationships are called \"Inter-Plan Arrangements.\" These Inter -Plan Arrangements work b ased on rules and procedures issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (\"Association\"). Whenever you access healthcare services outside the geographic area We serve (the \" Anthem Service Area\"), the claim for those services may be processed throu gh one of these Inter-Plan Arrangements. The Inter-Plan Arrangements are described below. When you receive care outside of the Anthem Service Area, you will receive it from one of two kinds of Providers. Most Providers (\"Participating Provider s\") contract with the local Blue C ross and/or Blue Shield Plan in that geographic area (\"Host Blue\"). Some Providers (\"Non-Participating Provider s\") don't contract with the Host Blue. We explain below how We, on behalf of the Plan Sponsor, pay both kinds of Providers. Inter-Plan Arrangemen ts Eligibility - Claim Types Most claim types are eligible to be processed through Inter-Plan Arrangements, as described above. Examples of claims that are not included are Prescription Drugs that you obtain from a Pharmacy and most dental or vision benefits. A. Blue Card\u00ae Program Under the BlueCard\u00ae Program, when you receive Covered Services within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, We will still fulfill our contractual obligations. But, the Host Blue is responsible for: (a) contracting with its Providers; and (b) handling its interactions with those Providers. When you receive Covered Services outside of the Anthem Service Area and the claim is pro cessed through the BlueCard Program, the amount you pay is calculated based on the lower of: The billed charges for Covered Services. The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to Us. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to the Provider . Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with that Provider. Sometimes, such an arrangement may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for services provided by similar types of Providers. Estimated and average pricing arrangements may also involve types of settlements, incentive payments and/or other credits or charges. Estimated pricing and average pricing also take into account adjustments to correct for over- or underestimation of past pricing of claims, as noted above. However, such adjustments will not affect the price We used for your claim because they will not be applied after a claim has already been paid. B. Negotiated (non-BlueCard Program) Arrangements With respect to one or more Host Blues, instead of using the BlueCard Program, We may process your claims for Covered Services through Neg otiated Arrangements for National Accounts. The amount you pay for Covered Services under this arrangement will be calculated based on the lower of either billed charges for Covered Services or the negotiated price (refer to the description of negotiated price u nder Section A. BlueCard Program) made available to Us by the Host Blue. C. Special Cases: Value-Based Programs BlueCard\u00ae Program If you receive Covered Services under a Value-Based Program inside a Ho st Blue's Service Area, you will not be responsible for paying any of the Provider Ince ntives, risk-sharing, and/or Care Coordinator Fees that are a part of such an arrangement, except when a Host Blue passes these fees to Us through average pricing or fee schedule adjustments. Additional information is available upon request. Value-Based Programs: Negotiated (non-BlueCard Program) Arrangements If We have entered into a Negotiated Arrangement with a Host Blue to pro vide Value-Based Programs to the Plan Sponsor on your behalf, We will follow the same procedures for Value-Based Programs administration and Care Coor dinator Fees as noted above for the BlueCard Program. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC ter-Plan Programs: Fede ral/State Taxes/Surcharges/Fees Federal or applicable law s or regulations may require a surcharge, tax or other fee. If applicable, We will include any such surcharge, tax or other fee as part of the claim charge passed on to you. E. Non-Participating Providers Outside Our Service Area 1. Allowed Amounts and Member Liabili ty Calculati on When Covered Services are provided outside of Our Service Area by Non -Participating Providers, We may determine benefits and make payment based on pricing from either the Host Blue or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state or federal law. In these situations, the amount you pay for such services as Deductible, Copayment or Coinsurance will be based on that allowed amount. Also, you may be responsible for the difference between the am ount that the Non -Participating Provider bills and the payment We will make for the Covered Services as set forth in this paragraph. Federal or applicable law, as applicable, will govern payments for out -of- network Emergency services. 2. Exceptions In certain situations, We may use other pricing methods, such as billed charges or the pricing We would use if the healthcare services had been obtained within the Anthem Service Area, or a special negotiated price to determine the amount We will pay for services provided by Non-Participating Provider s. In these situations, you may be liable for the difference between the amount that the Non-Participating Provider bills and the payment We make for the Covered Services as set forth in this paragraph. F. Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core\u00ae Program If you plan to travel outside the United States, call Member Services to find out your Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core benefits. Benefits for services received outside of the United States may be different from ser vices received in the United States. Remember to take an up to date Health Benefit ID card with you.

CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 69 GENERAL POLICY PROVISIONS Care Coordination - We, on behalf of the Plan Sponsor, pay In -Network Providers in various ways to provide Covered Services to you. For example, sometimes We may pay In -Network Providers a separate amount for each Covered Service they provide. We may also pay t hem one amount for all Covered Services related to treatment of a medical condition. Other times, We may pay a periodic, fixed pre -determined amount to cover the costs of Covered Services. In addition, We may pay In -Network Providers financial incentives o r other amounts to help improve quality of care and/or promote the delivery of health care services in a cost -efficient manner, or compensate In -Network Providers for coordination of Member care. In some instances, In -Network Providers may be required to m ake payment to Us because they did not meet certain standards. You do not share in any payments made by In -Network Providers to Us under these programs. Catastrophic Events - In case of fire, flood, war, civil disturbance, court order, strike, an act of te rrorism or other cause beyond Our control, We may be unable to process your claims on a timely basis. No legal action or lawsuit may be taken against Us due to a delay caused by any of these events. Changes to the Booklet - If Colorado State University req uests a change that reduces or eliminates coverage, such change must be requested in writing or signed by the University. The University will notify you of such change(s) to coverage. We or the University will later send or make available to you an amendme nt to this Booklet or a new Booklet. No agent or employee of Ours may change this Booklet by giving information that is not correct or complete, or by contradicting the terms of this Booklet. Any such situation will not prevent Us from administering this B ooklet in strict accordance with its terms. Oral or written statements do not replace the terms of this Booklet. Confidentiality and Release of Information - Applicable state and federal law requires Anthem to undertake efforts to safeguard the member's in formation. For informational purposes only, please be advised that a statement describing Anthem's policies and procedures regarding the protection, use and disclosure of the member's medical information is available on Anthem's website and can be furnishe d to the member upon request by contacting the member service department. Obligations that arise under state and federal law and policies and procedures relating to privacy that are referenced but not included in this Booklet are not part of the contact be tween the parties and do not give rise to contractual obligations. Conformity with Law - any term in this Booklet which is in conflict with the laws of the state in which the Group Contract is issued, or with federal law, will hereby be automatically amended to conform with the minimum requirements of such laws. Decision Makers - In some ca ses, We will recognize others as surrogate decision -makers to make decisions related to your health insurance coverage as required by the law. We require documentation as required by law for this authorization or appointment. Fraudulent Insurance Acts - It is against the law to knowingly provide false, incomplete or misleading facts or information to an insurance company for defrauding or attempting to defraud the company. Penalties may include imprisonment, fines, denial of insurance and civil damages. Any insurance company or agent of an insurance company who knowingly provides false, incomplete or misleading facts or information to a policyholder or claimant for defrauding or attempting to defraud th e policyholder or claimant with regard to a settlement o r award payable from insurance proceeds shall be reported to the Colorado Division of Insurance within the Department of Regulatory Agencies. Insurance fraud results in cost increases for health care coverage. You can help decrease these costs by doing the following: Be wary of offers to waive Copayments, Deductible and/or Coinsurance. This practice is usually illegal . Be wary of mobile health testing labs. Ask what the insurance company will be charged for the tests . Always review the Explanation of Benefits received from Us. If there are any discrepancies, call Our Member Services . Be very cautious about giving your health insurance coverage information over the phone. If fraud is suspected, you should contact Our Member Services. We r eserve the right to recoup any benefit payments paid on your behalf, and/or rescinding your membership under this Booklet retroactively as if it never existed if you have committed fraud or material misrepresentation in applying for covera ge in or receivin g or filing for benefits. Independent Contractors - We have an independent contractor relationship with Our Participating Providers.

We may subcontract particular services to organizations or entities that are experts in certain areas. This may include Prescription Drugs, Mental Health Condition and Substance Abuse services. Such subcontracted organizations or entities may make benefit determinations and/or perform administrative, claims payment or Member Services duties on Our behalf. Medical Policy and Technology Assessment - We review and evaluate new technology a ccording to its technology evaluation criteria developed by its medical directors. Technology assessment criteria are used to determine the Experimental/Investigational status or Medical Necessity of new technology. Guidance and external validation of Our medical policy is provided by the Medical Policy and Technology Assessment Committee (MPTAC) which consists of approximately 20 Doctors from various medical specialties including Our medical directors, Doctors in academic medicine and Doctors in private pr actice. Conclusions made are incorporated into medical policy used to establish decision protocols for particular diseases or treatments and applied to Medical Necessity criteria used to determine whether a procedure, service, supply or equipment is covere d.

Except when federal law require Us to be the primary payer, the benefits under this Booklet if you are age 65 and older, or Members otherwise eligible for Medicare, do not d uplicate any benefit for which you are entitled under Medicare, including Part B. Where Medicare is the responsible payer, all sums payable by Medicare for services provided to you shall be reimbursed by or on your behalf to Us, to the extent We have made payment for such services. For the purposes of the calculation of benefits, if you have not enrolled in Medicare Part B, we will calculate benefits as if you had enrolled.

We do not design, calculate, award or permit financial or other rewards based on the frequency of: denials of authorization for coverage; reductions or limitations on Hospital lengths of stay, medical services or charges; or calls or other contacts with you or your Provider. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 71 Paragraph Headings - The headings used in this Booklet are for re ference only and are not to be used by themselves for interpreting the terms of the Booklet. Payment Innovation Programs - We, on behalf of Colorado State University, pay In -Network Providers through various types of contractual arrangements. Some of these arrangements - Payment Innovation Programs (Program(s)) - may include financial incentives to help improve quality of care and promote the delivery of health care services in a cost -efficient manner. These programs may vary in methodology and subject area of focus and may be modified by Us from time -to-time, but they will be generally designed to tie a certain portion of an In -Network Provider's total compensation to pre -defined quality, cost, efficiency or service standards or metrics. In some instances, In-Network Providers may be required to make payment to Us under the program as a consequence of failing to meet these pre -defined standards. The programs are not intended to affect your access to health care. The program payments are not made as payment f or specific Covered Services provided to you, but instead, are based on the In -Network Provider's achievement of these pre - defined standards. You are not responsible for any Copayment or Coinsurance amounts related to payments made by Us or to Us under the program(s), and you do not share in any payments made by Network Providers to Us under the Program(s). Physical Examinations and Autopsies - We have the right, at Our expense, to request an examination of a person covered by Us when and as often as it may reasonably be required during the review of a case or claim. On the death of a Member, We may request an autopsy where it is not forbidden by law. Policies and Procedures - We are able to introduce new policies, procedures, rules and interpretations, as l ong as they are reasonable. Such changes are introduced to make the Plan more orderly and efficient. Members must follow and accept any new policies, procedures, rules, and interpretations. Under the terms of the Group Contract, we have the authority, in o ur sole discretion, to introduce or terminate from time -to- time, pilot or test programs for disease management or wellness initiatives which may result in the payment of benefits not otherwise specified in this Booklet. We reserve the right to discontinue a pilot or test program at any time. Program Incentives - We may offer incentives from time to time, at our discretion, in order to introduce you to covered programs and services available under this plan. The purpose of these incentives include, but is not limited to, making you aware of cost effective benefit options or services, helping you achieve your best health, and encouraging you to update member -related information. These incentives may be offered in various forms such as retailer coupons, gift cards, health related merchandise, and discounts on fees or Member cost shares. Acceptance of these incentives is voluntary as long as We offer the incentives program. We may discontinue an incentive for a particular covered program or service at any time. If you have any questions about whether receipt of an ince ntive or retailer coupon results in taxable income to you, We recommend that you consult your tax advisor. Research Fees - We reserve the right to charge an administrative fee when a lot of research is necessary to reconstruct information that has already been given to you in Explanations of Benefits, letters or other documents. Reserve Funds - You are not entitled to share in any reserve or other funds that may be accumulated or established by Us, unless We grant a right to share in such funds. Right of Re covery and Adjustment - When payment has been made in error, We will have the right to recover such payment from you or the Provider, or otherwise make appropriate adjustment to claims. In most instances such recovery or adjustment activity shall be limite d to the calendar year in which the error is discovered. We have oversight responsibility for compliance with Provider and vendor and Subcontractor contracts. We may enter into a settlement or compromise regarding enforcement of these contracts and may ret ain any recoveries made from a Provider, vendor, or Subcontractor resulting from these audits if the return of the overpayment is not likely. Additionally, We have established recovery and adjustment policies to determine which recoveries and adjustments are to be pursued, when to incur costs and settle or compromise recovery and adjustment amounts. We will not pursue recoveries for overpayments or adjustments for underpayments if the cost of the activity exceeds the overpayment or underpayment amount. We reserve the right to deduct or offset, including cross plan offsetting on In -Network claims and on Out -of-Network claims where the Out-of-Network Provider agrees to cross plan offsetting, any amounts paid in error from any pending or future claim. Sending Notices - All Subscriber notices are considered sent to and received by the Subscriber when deposited in the United States mail with postage prepaid and addressed to either one of the following: The Subscriber at the latest address in Our membership records . The Subscriber's employer. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 72 Value -Added Programs - We may offer health or fitness related programs to our Members, through which you may access discounted rates from certain vendors for products and services available to the general public. Products and service s available under this program are not Covered Services under your Plan but are in addition to Plan benefits. As such, program features are not guaranteed under your health Plan Contract and could be discontinued at any time. We do not endorse any vendor, product or service associated with this program. Program vendors are solely responsible for the products and services you receive. WORKERS' COMPENSATION The benefits under this Plan are not designed to duplicate benefits that you are eligible for under Wor kers' Compensation Law. All money paid or owed by Workers' Compensation for services provided to you shall be paid back by you, or on your behalf, to us if we have made or make payment for the services received. It is understood that coverage under this Pl an does not replace or affect any Workers' Compensation coverage requirements. Services and supplies due to illness or injury related to your work are not a benefit under this Booklet , except for officers of the company who have opted out of workers' compe nsation before the illness or injury. This exclusion from coverage applies to costs due from occupational accident or sickness covered under the following: Occupational disease laws . Employer's liability insurance . Municipal, state, or federal law . The Wor kers' Compensation Act. We will not pay benefits for services and supplies due to illness or injury related to your work even if other benefits are n ot paid because: You fail to file a claim within the filing period allowed by law . You get care that is not approved by workers' compensation insurance . Colorado State University fails to carry the required workers' compensation insurance. In this case, the University becomes liable for any of the illness or injury costs related to your work . You fail to follow any other terms of the Workers' Compensation Act. AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE PROVISIONS We will coordinate the benefits of this Booklet with the benefits of a complying auto insurance policy. A complying automobile insurance policy is an auto policy that meets the minimum standards approved by the appropriate state or federal legislation or regulation. How We Coordinate Benefits with Auto Policies - Your benefits under this Booklet may be coordinated with the coverage's afforded by an auto policy. After an y primary coverage's offered by the auto policy are exhausted, including without limitation any no -fault, personal injury protection, or medical payment coverages, We will pay benefits subject to the terms and conditions of this Booklet. If there is more t han one auto policy that offers primary coverage, each will pay its maximum coverage before We are liable for any further payments. You, your representative, agents and heirs must fully cooperate with Us to make sure that the auto policy has paid all requi red benefits. We may require you to take a physical examination in disputed cases. If there is an auto policy in effect, and you waive or fail to assert your rights to such benefits, this plan will not pay those benefits that could be available u nder an au to policy. We may require proof that the auto policy has paid all primary benefits before making any payments under this Booklet. On the other hand, We may but are not required to pay benefits under this Booklet, and later coordinate with or seek reimburse ment under the auto policy. In all cases, upon payment, We are entitled to exercise Our rights under this Booklet and under applicable law against any and all potentially responsible parties or insurers. In that event, We may exercise the rights found in t his section. What Happens If You Do Not Have Another Policy - We will pay benefits if you are injured while you are riding in or driving a motor vehicle that you own if it is not covered by an auto policy. Similarly if not covered by an auto policy, We wil l also pay benefits for your injuries if as a non -owner or driver, passenger or when walking you were in a motor vehicle accident. In that event, We may exercise the rights found in this section. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 73 SUBROGATION AND REIMBURSEMENT These provisions apply when the plan pays benefits as a result of injuries or illnesses you sustained and you have a right to a Recovery or have received a Recovery from any source. A Recovery includes, but is not limited to, monies received from any person or party, any person's or pa rty's liability insurance, uninsured /underinsured motorist proceeds, worker's compensation insurance or fund, no -fault insurance and/or automobile medical payments coverage, whether by lawsuit, settlement or otherwise. Regardless of how you or your represe ntative or any agreements characterize the money you receive as a Recovery , it shall be subject to these provisions. Subrogation The plan has the right to recover payments it makes on your behalf from any party responsible for compensating you for your illnesses or injuries. The following apply: The plan has first priority from any Recovery for the full amount of benefits it has paid regardless of whether you are fully compensated, and regardless of whether the payments you receive make you whole for your losses, illnesses and/or injuries. You and your legal representative must do whatever is necessary to enable the plan to exercise the plan's rights and do nothing to prejudice those rights. In the event that you or your legal representative fail to do whatever is necessary to enable the plan to exercise its subrogation rights, the plan shall be entitled to deduct the amount the plan paid from any future benefits under the plan. The plan has the right to take whatever legal action it sees fit against an y person, party or entity to recover the benefits paid under the plan. To the extent that the total assets from which a Recovery is available are insufficient to satisfy in full the plan's subrogation claim and any claim held by you, the plan's subrogation claim shall be first satisfied before any part of a Recovery is applied to your claim, your attorney fees, other expenses or costs. The plan is not responsible for any attorney fees, attorney liens, other expenses or costs you incur. The ''common fund'' doctrine does not apply to any funds recovered by any attorney you hire regardless of whether funds recovered are used to repay benefits paid by the plan. Reimbursement If you obtain a Recovery and the plan has not been repaid for the benefits the plan paid on your behalf, the plan shall have a right to be repaid from the Recovery in the amount of the benefits paid on your behalf and the following provisions will apply: You must promptly reimburse the plan from any Recovery to the extent of benefits the plan paid on your behalf regardless of whether the payments you receive make you whole for your losses, illnesses and/or injuries. Notwithstanding any allocation or designation of your Recovery (e.g., pain and suffering) made in a settlement agreement or court order, the plan shall have a right of full recovery, in first priority, against any Recovery. Further, the plan's rights will not be reduced due to your negligence. You and your legal representative must hold in trust for the plan the proceeds of the gros s Recovery (i.e., the total amount of your Recovery before attorney fees, other expenses or costs) to be paid to the plan immediately upon your receipt of the Recovery. You and your legal representative acknowledge that the portion of the Recovery to which the plan's equitable lien applies is a plan asset. Any Recovery you obtain must not be dissipated or disbursed until such time as the plan has been repaid in accordance with these provisions. You must reimburse the plan, in first priority and without any set-off or reduction for attorney fees, other expenses or costs. The ''common fund'' doctrine does not apply to any funds recovered by any attorney you hire regardless of whether funds recovered are used to repay benefits paid by the plan. If you fail to r epay the plan, the plan shall be entitled to deduct any of the unsatisfied portion of the amount of benefits the plan has paid or the amount of your Recovery whichever is less, from any future benefit under the plan if: 1. The amount the plan paid on your beh alf is not repaid or otherwise recovered by the plan . 2. You fail to cooperate. In the event that you fail to disclose the amount of your settlement to the plan, the plan shall be entitled to deduct the amount of the plan's lien from any future benefit under the plan. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 74 The plan shall also be entitled to recover any of the unsatisfied portion of the amount the plan has paid or the amount of your Recovery, whichever is less, directly from the Providers to whom the plan has made payments on your behalf. In such a circumstance, it may then be your obligation to pay the Provider the full billed amount, and the plan will not have any obligation to pay the Provider or reimburse you. The plan is entitled to reimbursement from any Recovery, in first priority, even if the Recovery does not fully satisfy the judgment, settlement or underlying claim for damages or fully compensate you or make you whole. Your Duties You must notify the plan promptly of how, when and where an accident or incident resulting in personal injury or illness to you occurred and all information regarding the parties involved and any other information requested by the plan . You must cooperate with the plan in the investigation, settlement and protection of the plan's rights. In the event that you or your legal representative fail to do whatever is necessary to enable the plan to exercise its subrogation or reimbursement rights, the plan shall be entitled to deduct the amount the plan paid from any future benefits under the plan. You must not do anything to prejudice the plan's rights. You must send the plan copies of all police reports, notices or other papers received in connection with the accident or incident resulting in personal injury or illness to you. You must promptly notify the plan if you retain an attorney or if a lawsuit is filed on your behalf. You must immediately notify the plan if a trial is commenced, if a settlement occurs or if potentially dispositive motions are filed in a case. The plan administrator has sole discretion to in terpret the terms of the Subrogation and Reimbursement provision of this plan in its entirety and reserves the right to make changes as it deems necessary. If the covered person is a minor, any amount recovered by the minor, the minor's trustee, guardian, parent, or other representative, shall be subject to this provision. Likewise, if the covered person's relatives, heirs, and/or assignees make any Recovery because of injuries sustained by the covered person, that Recovery shall be subject to this provisio n. The plan is entitled to recover its attorney's fees and costs incurred in enforcing this provision. The plan shall be secondary in coverage to any medical payments provision, no -fault automobile insurance policy or personal injury protection policy rega rdless of any election made by you to the contrary. The plan shall also be secondary to any excess insurance policy, including, but not limited to, school and/or athletic policies. Coordination of Benefits When Members Are Insured Under More Than One Plan We coordinate benefits when you have duplicate coverage. Duplicate Coverage - Duplicate coverage exists when you are covered by this coverage and also covered by another group or group -type health or dental insurance or health or dental care benefits cover age or blanket coverage, or where permitted by law, an individual insurance policy. The total benefits received by you, or on your behalf, from all coverage's combined for any claim for Covered Services will not exceed 100 percent of the total covered char ges. Allowable Expense is a health care expense, including deductibles, coinsurance and copayments, that is covered at least in part by any plan covering the member. When a plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each s ervice will be considered an allowable expense and a benefit paid. An expense that is not covered by any plan covering the member is not an allowable expense. In addition, any expense that a provider by law or in accordance with a contractual agreement is prohibited from charging the member is not an allowable expense. The following are not allowable expense: 1. The difference between the cost of a semi -private hospital room and a private hospital room, unless one of the plans provides coverage for private hos pital room expenses. 2. If the member is covered by two plans that calculate benefits or services on the basis of a reasonable and customary amount or relative value schedule reimbursement method or some other similar reimbursement method, any amount in excess of the higher of the reasonable and customary amounts. 3. If the member is covered by two plans that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated rates or fees, an amount in excess of the highest of the negotiated rates. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 75 4. If the member is cov ered by one plan that calculates its benefits or services on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement methodology or other similar reimbursement methodology and another plan that provides its benefits or services on th e basis of negotiated fees, the primary plan's payment arrangement shall be the allowable expense for all plans. However, if the provider has contracted with the secondary plan to provide the benefit or service for a specific negotiated fee or payment amou nt that is different than the primary plan's payment arrangement and if the provider's contract permits, the negotiated fee or payment shall be the allowable expense used by the secondary plan to determine its benefits. 5. The amount of any benefit reduction by the primary plan because the member failed to comply with the Plan provisions is not an allowable expense. Examples of these types of plan provisions include second surgical opinions, precertification of admissions, and preferred provider arrangements. 6. If the member advises Anthem that all plans covering the member are high deductible health plans as defined by Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code, and the member intends to contribute to a health savings account established in accordance with Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code, any amount that is subject to the primary high deductible health plan's deductible. How We Determine Which Coverage is Primary and Which is Secondary - We will determine the primary coverage and secondary coverage accordi ng to the following rule: A coverage is primary if it does not have order of benefit determination rules or if it has rules that differ from those permitted by state law. The amount that is subject to the Primary high -deductible health plan's deductible, i f We have been advised by you that all Plans covering you are high -deductible health plans and you intend to contribute to a health savings account established in accordance with Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Duplicate Coverage on Members - A coverage is primary if the Member claiming benefits is the person in whose name the policy is issued but who is not a Dependent under that coverage (except when covered by Medicare or COBRA). The benefits of a coverage whi ch covers a person as an employee who is not laid -off or retired (or as that employee's Dependent) is primary before benefits of a coverage which covers that person as a laid -off or retired employee (or as that employee's Dependent). When you (including yo ur Dependent family Members) have duplicate coverage carried through two or more employers, the policy that has been in force the longest period of time is primary. The policy that has been in force the shortest period of time is secondary. When the cover age through one of the employers is a COBRA policy and one of the coverage's is through active employment, the coverage through active employment is primary. NOTE: Change in plan administrators is considered continuous coverage. Therefore, the Effective D ate of the coverage in that group is the Effective Date with the original carrier who provided insurance or the original administrator for self - funded plans, as long as there were no lapses in coverage. Information about coordinating benefits for Members who hold two insurance policies and Medicare may be found under the \"Members with Medicare and Two Group Insurance Policies\" heading in this section of this Benefit Booklet. Duplicate Coverage on Spouses - When your Spouse has group coverage through an emp loyer and is actively working, that coverage is primary for the Spouse. When the coverage carried by the Spouse is through retiree or inactive employment, that coverage will be primary over the coverage carried by our Subscriber. When the Spouse's coverage through the employer is a COBRA policy and our coverage is active, then the Spouse's COBRA coverage will be secondary to us. Note: Information about coordinating benefits for Members who hold two insurance policies and Medicare may be found under the head ing \"Members with Medicare and Two Group Insurance Policies\" heading in this section. Duplicate Coverage on Dependent Children (when parents are not separated or divorced) - If both coverages cover the child as a Dependent, the benefits of the coverage of the parent whose birthday occurs earlier in the year is primary (\"Birthday Rule\") over those of the coverage of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year. However, if both parents have the same birthday (month and day, not year), then the benefits of the coverage that has covered the parent and Dependent(s) longest is primary over the coverage which has covered the other parent and Dependent(s) for a shorter period of time. If either form of coverage does not follow the Birthday Rule, the male subs criber's insurance or plan is the primary Plan. Duplicate Coverage on Dependent Children (when parents are separated or divorced) - We require a copy of the divorce decree to establish primacy on children of divorced parents. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 76 When the specific terms of a c ourt decree state that one of the parents is responsible for providing health insurance for the child that insurance policy is primary. The insurance policy of the other parent is the secondary coverage. The insurance policy or plan of the parent with leg al custody of the child is primary. When the parent with custody remarries, the custodial parent's coverage remains primary. The stepparent's coverage becomes secondary, and the coverage of the parent without custody pays after the stepparent's coverage. The Birthday Rule (benefits of the coverage of the parent whose birthday occurs earlier in the year are primary) applies when the specific terms of the court decree state that the parents share joint custody and both must provide health benefits. The Birth day Rule applies when the specific terms of the court decree state that the parents share joint custody, without stating which parent is responsible for providing health benefits for the child. When the divorce decree states that one of the parents is resp onsible for providing health insurance and the parents share joint custody, then the parent providing the coverage will be primary. Members with a Stand -Alone Dental Policy - For Covered Services provided by an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon, the Plan will be secondary for when the Member is covered under a Stand -Alone Dental Policy. \"Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon\" means a dentist who has been issued a specialist's license to practice oral and maxillofacial surgery pursuant to NRS 631.250 and who provides any of the services described in paragraph (c) of subsection 1 of NRS 631.215. \"Stand - Alone Dental Policy\" means any policy which only pays for or reimburses any part of the cost of dental care, as defined in NRS 695D.030, and is offered or issued separate ly from a policy of health insurance. How We Coordinate Benefits - When we are the primary coverage, including if you have other coverage under an individual policy of insurance, we pay benefits under the terms of this Benefit Booklet. When we are the secondary coverage, we may pay up to the difference between benefits that would be payable by the primary coverage and the amount that would be payable under this Benefit Booklet in the absence of a Coordination of Benefits provision, so long as that diffe rence is not more than this Plan would normally pay. Benefits provided under any other coverage include benefits that would have been provided had a claim been made for these benefits. Determining Primacy Between Medicare and this Plan - We will be the pri mary payer for persons age 65 and older with Medicare coverage if the Subscriber is actively working for an employer who is providing the Subscriber's health insurance and the employer has 20 or more employees. Medicare will be the primary payer for perso ns age 65 and older with Medicare coverage if the Subscriber is not actively working and the member is enrolled in Medicare. Medicare will be the primary payer for persons with Medicare age 65 and older if the employer has less than 20 employees and the me mber is enrolled in Medicare. This Plan will be the primary payer for persons under age 65 with Medicare coverage when Medicare coverage is due to disability if the member is actively working for an employer who is providing the member's health coverage an d the employer has 100 or more employees. Medicare will be the primary payer for persons enrolled with Medicare due to disability if the member is not actively working or the employer has less than 100 employees. This Plan will be the primary payer for pe rsons under age 65 with Medicare coverage when Medicare coverage is due to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), for the first 30 months from the entitlement to or eligibility for Medicare (whether or not Medicare is taken at that time). After 30 months, Medicar e will become the primary payer if Medicare is in effect (30 - month coordination period). When a Member becomes eligible for Medicare due to a second entitlement (such as age), we remain primary, if we were primary at the point when the second entitlement b ecame effective, for the duration of 30 months after the Medicare entitlement or eligibility due to ESRD. If Medicare was primary at the point of the second entitlement, then Medicare remains primary. There will be no 30 -month coordination period for ESRD . Members with Medicare and Two Group Insurance Policies - If Medicare is secondary to a group coverage (see Medicare primacy rules), the primary coverage covering the Member will pay first, Medicare will pay second, and the coverage covering the Member as a retiree or inactive employee or Dependent will pay third. The order of primacy is not based on the group health insurance subscriber. If Medicare is the primary payer due to Medicare primacy rules, then the rules of primacy for employees and their Spou ses will be used to determine the coverage that will pay second and third. The rules of primacy can be found under the heading \"Double Coverage on Spouses.\" Your Obligations - You have an obligation to provide us with current and accurate information rega rding the existence of other coverage. Benefits payable under another coverage include benefits that would be payable under that coverage, whether or not a claim is made, and benefits that would have been paid but were refused because the claim was not sen t to the Provider of other coverage on a timely basis. CSU GF POS 2023 EOC v 03 -28-2023 77 Your benefits under this Benefit Booklet will be reduced by the amount that such benefits would duplicate benefits pay able under the primary coverage. Anthem's Rights to Receive and Release Necessary Information - We may release to, or obtain, from any insurance company or other organization or person any information which we may need to carry out the terms of this Booklet. Members will furnish to us such information as may be necessary to carry out th e terms of this Booklet. Payment of Benefits to Others - Whenever payments that should have been made under this Benefit Booklet have been made under any other coverage, we will have the right to pay to the other coverage any amount we determine to be warranted to satisfy the intent of this provision. Any amount so paid will be considered to be benefits paid under this Benefit Booklet, and with that payment we will fully sati sfy our liability under this provision. Right of Overpayment Recovery - If we have overpaid for Covered Services under this provision, we will have the right, by offset or otherwise, to recover the excess amount from you or any person or entity to which, o r on whose behalf, the payments were made.

In the case of a benefit denial based on utilization review, an independent external review appeal is also available to the member. Members may d esignate a representative (e.g., the member's physician or anyone else of the member's choosing) to file any level of appeal review with Anthem on the member's behalf. The member must give this designation to Anthem in writing. Level 1 Appea l This is an appeal in which Anthem appoints an internal person(s) not involved in the initial determination to review the denial of the claim, requested service or supply. A person that was previously involved with the denial may answer questions. The person(s) appointed to review a Level 1 Appeal involving utilization review shall consult with an appropriate clinical person(s) in the same specialty as would typically manage the case being reviewed.

A member or member's representative has the right to request an expedited appeal of a utilization review decision when the time frames for a standard review would: seriously jeopardize the life or health of the covered person; jeopardize the covered person's abi lity to regain maximum function; or for persons with a disability, create an imminent and substantial limitation on their existing ability to live independently. Typically the decision will be made within 72 hours. Expedited appeal s will be evaluated by an appropriate clinical peer or peers who were not involved in the initial denial.
