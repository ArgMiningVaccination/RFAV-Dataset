The map shows everythingleading to something but that'sif you know where you're going, and that'swhen you don't need a map. And that'swhat winter does, splits the roads like chapped lips, or it'swhat summer does, or it'swhat they do to each other\u2014and it allhappens out here, the sky pinkas a skinned knee, the clouds pulled over the sunlike gauze, the crowshysterical. And I'm trying,I am, I'm using both handsto hold myself still but I can't, and that'swhat you do to me, orwhat I do to myself, aloneand wishing I missed you. Out here the houses are just boxes deliveredinside larger boxes, on the bedsof larger trucks, and maybe they even come with us in them, eating,or reading, or lying there, tryingto sleep, or sitting outsidein the driveway, in the car,in the starlight, in the silence, on the road as it thaws and swells and freezes like breathing under all of this weight. AUGUST It's hot in the hallways, the breeze a bedroom recluse, captiveand shuddering. Each night we soak the sheets, sleepinglike strangers, our skinfrictionless. I'm leavingsoon, like alwaysin August, but if nobody movesthen there is no soon . The bottles sweat. The fans sayno. We kiss with our mouths full of ice.TRAVEL SONG There is no escaping your body, or anyone else's, or whatever you've done in any hotel room, in the bellies of bathtubs, on ash-scabbed carpets, in the morning's yawning mouth of broken light. All you wanted was the wanting, someone else's, to bask in. A mold for your body's soft clay. But what's empty's what rises, the hollow bones of birds, the halves of the hull cupped like hands. Even the fish are all floating and blissful, belly-up, wide-eyed, hanging like clouds over various castles and towers and divers and chests overflowing with gold, like our chests are, when morning finds the sheets wrinkled like skin and no body between them. Desire's a hand closing and coming up empty. Love is the fist you keep clenched in your gut. What's touched is just the shucked husk, exoskeletal. What you want is the light in your palm. Interview and photos by Julianne Popovec Ali Shapiro is a recent graduate of the MFA program in poetry at the University of Michigan, where she sometimes teaches composition and creative writing. She is also a Writer-in-Residence with the InsideOut Literary Arts Project in Detroit. Her poems and comics have been published in RATTLE, Redivider, Linebreak, and PANK. Here you'll find three of her poems and our Q&A. Q&A Julianne: Ali, how long have you been writing poetry? Ali: I started writing poems as a very little kid; I got my first rejection \u2014 from Stone Soup magazine \u2014 when I was about six years old. Julianne: When you first started writing, did you feel a natural inclination toward poetry? What do you like about it compared to other genres?Ali: I'm not sure why I was initially drawn to poetry, but my best guess is that I got there via songs. My dad put Shel Silverstein's poems to music. He played the piano and I sang. So poems were always around, and usually stuck in my head. I wrote \u2014 and write \u2014 in other genres, too. Essays, comics, the occasional story. But I like writing poems because they're short, which means I can finish them. I realize that sounds ridiculous, but it's true. I mean, there are lots of other things I love about poetry, but I don't think they're exclusive to poetry; they're really things I love about art. Poems just happen to be the kind of art that I can sit still long enough to make. Julianne: Who are some of your favorite poets and/or writers? Ali: I semi-recently wrote a blog post for Ploughshares about my penchant for gay male poets; they continue to occupy a large swath of my personal canon. I also love poets who aren't gay men; right now, I'm hooked on Dean Young, Bob Hicok, and Monica Youn. And I also love poets who aren't only poets, like Denis Johnson and Nick Flynn. Julianne: \"Frost Law,\" \"August,\" and \"Travel Song\" seem to be interrelated. They seem connected by themes of movement and stillness, love and desire. Did you intend them to be interrelated or read in sequence? I'm also curious, did you write \"Frost Law\" in winter? It seems that people often associate winter with a time for self-reflection. Have these very cold and snowy past few months inspired any of your latest poems? If so, in what ways? What other types of things inspire your poems? Ali: \"August\" is the last poem I wrote before moving to Michigan. I drove there from Seattle via New York City. It's much sparser than my usual poems. I think I was too hot to write longer lines. Also, the pieces of the poem Poems just happen to be the kind of art that I can sit still long enough to make. Ali Shapiro on How to Read a PoemThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 9 presented themselves to me very neatly, one after another, like a series of facts. And I guess they were facts; it's a \"true\" poem, in that it really was August, and I really was leaving, and my parents' apartment really was full of those disapproving fans. \"Frost Law\" is the first poem I wrote after moving to Michigan \u2014 which was in early fall, actually, not winter. But winter is definitely in the poem \u2014 its before- and after-effects, the way it kind of pressurizes October. You can feel it coming. I could, anyway. I was going on all these very long bike rides, getting totally lost, but it didn't matter, because everything was \u2014 is \u2014 just so flat. It made me kind of restless and panicky. I wanted to exhaust myself, but I felt like I could pedal forever. Some of that comes out in the poem, I think \u2014 the long run of gerunds at the end, for example. (Bonus fact: frost laws are \"seasonal restriction on traffic weight limits and speeds on roadways subject to thaw weakening.\" I meant to write a follow-up poem called \"Thaw Weakening,\" but I never got around to it.) \"Travel Song\" came later. I had gotten \u2014 adopted? rescued? \u2014 this Betta fish, Wendell, and we weren't getting along very well. I mean, I took good care of him anyway, of course, but really, I had wanted a dog, and he was a sorry substitute. Most of his time he spent lurking in the spires of his ceramic castle. Anyway, he would do this weird thing where he kind of played dead \u2014 like, I'd see him floating upside down by the filter, but as soon as I approached the tank to say my mournful but expedient goodbyes, he'd flip right side up and swim back to his castle in a huff. So the poem started with that image of him, floating over the castle, belly up but not really dead. And went from there. All of which is to say that yes, you're absolutely right, these three poems share the same theme. And it's not just these three poems. Those are my themes. On good days, I think those themes are big enough to sustain an infinite number of poems. On bad days, I think I need to get some new interests. But for better or worse, my default view of the world is through the lens of \u2014 as you said \u2014 \"movement and stillness, love and desire.\" Whether I'm looking at a sunset or a water bottle or a possibly-dead fish, I see those themes. Julianne: Are there particular themes or subjects that your poems seem to repeatedly lead you back to? Ali: See above. Also, sex. Which I guess could be expressed as movement + stillness + love + desire. In some cases, at least. Julianne: What can we get out of the experience of reading poetry, as opposed to reading fiction or prose?Ali: I hope there is a line or an image or an idea that skews the world just so \u2014 that makes the familiar seem suddenly strange. Like ... okay, there's this Franz Wright poem that ends: How does one go about dying? Who on earth is going to teach me- The world is filled with people who have never diedAnd that idea \u2014 those last three lines \u2014 the instant I read them, I was like, Oh. That's right. Of course. Not because I thought the world was full of dead people, but because I hadn't thought of it in those words, in that context. A familiar concept \u2014 death \u2014 became strange, became new again. Or this line from Bob Hicok's poem, A Primer : The Upper Peninsula is a spare statein case Michigan goes flat. I mean, obviously . And yet, I would never have looked at it that way without Hicok's help. Poems are really good at this kind of helping. It's one of my favorite things about them. And that's what I hope readers get from my poems, too: some help seeing the world in all its weirdness. Julianne: It seems that people are often intimidated by poetry because they feel they can't \"understand it.\" For us non-poets, can you offer advice on how to read a poem? Ali: By \"non-poets,\" I'm going to assume you mean people who do read something for pleasure, and/or who are on some level interested in relating to art. In which case, I have good news: you \"non-poets\" need not be intimidated! You just have to figure out whether or not you like reading poems. If you don't, you probably don't have to. If you do, great! Read more. Probably eventually you'll start noticing why you like certain poems, which I find to be among the most useful forms of \"understanding,\" because it will help you to find other poems that you will also like. If you like reading poems so much that you end up becoming some kind of expert poem-scholar, then it may become necessary to cultivate a more esoteric \"understanding\" of poetry with which to intimidate others ...but until then, sit back, relax, and enjoy reading poems. I may sound glib here, but I'm really quite serious. People often talk about \"inaccessible\" poetry, but what kind of access are they expecting or imagining? I think many people see words on a page and immediately expect clarity, or at least a clear attempt to communicate some sort of information or idea. That is, after all, the purpose of most of our writings \u2014 from emails to news articles to street signs, most text does in fact aim to align signifier and signified in such a way that the reader immediately understands that \"the lunch meeting is cancelled\" or the street is \"one way.\" But the text of a poem, I think, is somewhere between a street sign and a painting, or maybe a dance. A poem isn't purely aesthetic; it's not just a shape that happens to be made out of letters and spaces \u2014 but it's also not purely communicative. It's evocative. In a poem, words do more than just mean. If this sounds heady, well, it is and it isn't. On the one hand, there is great value in analyzing poetry. And it is possible to \"understand\" the \"meaning\" of a poem \u2014 or at least, it is possible to mis understand it; if you tell me \"The Road Not Taken\" is about robots, I'm going to tell you you're wrong. But on the other hand, it can be equally valuable to just ... take a poem in. Let it wash over you. Read it. Sit with it. Move on. See if it pulls you back. This is actually much harder than it sounds, because it means shutting off the voice in your head that keeps going, \"BUT I DON'T GET IT!\" or, worse: \"I'M NO GOOD AT READING POEMS!\" To paraphrase the poet Mary Oliver, \"You do not have to be good [at reading poems].\" You just have to read poems. Oh, right. You don't have to. But if you want to, you totally can. Julianne: Thank you, Ali!Ali Shapiro currently lives in Ann Arbor. She's the recipient of a Thomas J.

She has performed alone and in pairs at events like World Hoop Day (the first Saturday of October), expertly gliding through twirling hoops of fire and spinning with fairy-like form. On her website, Synchroblissity.com, Samson describes herself as \"a performance artist who specializes in creative movement.\" This barely scratches the surface of this dynamic woman. Not only does she hula hoop and dance with fire, Samson is a certified yoga instructor and a health, fitness, and wellness coach. She also runs Ann Arbor's own Dance Church, a donation-based weekly worship alternative. After heading to Western Michigan University to study kinesiology (the study of how the human body moves), Samson felt unfulfilled. She decided to follow in the footsteps of countless young people before her and pack her bags for California, where she coined the term synchroblissity \"to describe the beautiful unfolding of [her] travels.\" This is also where she was introduced to the ecstatic dance of Dance Church, a way to \"pray and play.\" Upon her return to Ann Arbor, Samson was determined to bring Dance Church with her. Every Sunday from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., she invites us to Mota Thai Yoga (416 W. Huron, Suite 22, Ann Arbor) to \"flow effortlessly into the wisdom of your body in the beat sanctuary called Dance Church.\" She delights in creating each unique two-hour playlist to fit the mood for the day, and is joined in free-form dance by people of all ages and activity levels. There is no judging in this \"blissful journey through dance and movement\"! 1Put on Your Dancing Shoes with Carla SamsonJenny Song at The Songbird Caf\u00e9 Carla Samson describes herself as \"a performance artist who specializes in creative movement.\" This barely scratches the surface of this dynamic woman. . . . Each of The Songbird Caf\u00e9's culinary delights is first created and tasted at home in the Song's own kitchen, before being added to the menu.Samson's own life journey has taken her across the United States, through New Zealand and Australia, to India, and back again. She feels her travels have helped her to cultivate a sense of inner strength and direction that she harnesses every day in her work. She beams as she shares her experiences. \"Being 21 years old and thinking, is this all there is? to now living a purposeful life embracing movement and artistic expression\" has been a journey joyfully undertaken. In addition to Dance Church, Samson offers lessons in Dance Meditation Technique, or DMT. \"This technique results in practitioners experiencing profound creative release and emotional transformation.\" Meditation through movement \"increases the conditions for personal discovery, insight, and healing physically and emotionally.\" If you are feeling unfulfilled in your own journey, why not join this capable and genuine spirit as she sets a new beat? You have nothing to lose but your inhibitions. Dance Church Ann Arbor is an open group held every Sunday from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at Mota Thai Yoga, located at 416 W. Huron, Suite 22, Ann Arbor 48103. Visit www.facebook.com/groups/dancechurchannarbor/ for more information.

The smooth wooden furniture and unique decorative lighting fixtures manage to flow naturally into the large handwritten chalkboard menu just inside the glass doors of the Songbird Caf\u00e9. At first glance, you may notice familiar offerings, such as the corned beef and cheddar sandwich or Caprese (served with chips or a pickle). Allow your eyes to migrate downwards and you will come to more unconventional, though no less tasty, offerings like the California Roll, comprised of crab salad, avocado, cucumber, lemon mayo, and honey mustard served on brioche. The drinks are equally varied and enticing. You could go with a mocha or cappuccino (or just plain coffee), but aren't you here to try something different? The Songbird happens to serve the best matcha (powdered green tea) latt\u00e9 in town. Other house favorites include the cardamom rose latte and fig vanilla black pepper latte (both made with coffee, not tea). If you aren't in the mood for a meal but require something to nosh on with your coffee, tea, or hot cocoa, there are plenty of baked goods to tempt you handily located right by the register. Is red velvet your weakness? Try the cupcake. How about a green tea red bean brioche? Ordering at the Songbird works much the same as places like Panera and even Culver's, where you order your food and beverages at the counter just inside the door, sit down at one of the many cozy tables or stand off to the side for a to-go order, then wait for them to bring your food to you. (You are also expected to bus your own table.) But this cafe is one-of-a-kind, locally owned and operated by Jenny Song and her mother, Youn. Youn Song is the previous owner of BeWon, a Korean restaurant also located on Plymouth Road. Jenny Song is a native of the north side of Ann Arbor, a graduate of both Huron High School and the University of Michigan. She earned her M.B.A. at the University of Chicago. Ann Arborites of all sides should be celebrating her return to the nest. At once both forward-thinking and down-home, the Songbird is a wonderful addition to Ann Arbor's foodie culture. Song says that owning the cafe with her mother has brought them closer together. It is from Youn that she first learned to appreciate fresh produce and healthy eating. Determined to bring both to the Songbird, each of the caf\u00e9's culinary delights is first created and tasted at home in their own kitchen before being added to the menu. If you think that being located so conveniently near to U-M's campus makes this a college den, think again. People of all ages and backgrounds have been flocking to the Songbird Caf\u00e9. The bar across from the counter is perfect for some solo work while the roomy seating area is a great place to meet up with friends. The ample parking of the shopping plaza and the caf\u00e9's free Wi-Fi also make it a great hangout! (And don't forget the matcha latt\u00e9.) The Songbird Caf\u00e9 is located at 2707 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor 48105.

After participating with us, we hope people are quicker to take social risks, question their self-imposed rules, permit themselves more freedoms and live out their days with more spontaneity.\" - Spon taneous ArtThe Spontaneous Natalie Berry At first glance, \"vegan yogini\" and \"giant mechanical cat that poops and coughs up hairballs\" don't seem to go together. That is the magic of Natalie Berry. A painter and performance artist based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Berry bursts with life, drawing people in with her big, warm smile, bright eyes, and colorful clothing choices. (Who doesn't love frilly tutus and rubber duck earrings?) And Berry loves cats. This particular oversized cat, named Lucky, is a project of Spontaneous Art, a group composed of Berry and fellow artists Chris Sandon and Trevor Stone. In 2013, the trio appeared on America's Got Talent with Lucky where they so shocked the unsuspecting audience, that the cameras wouldn't show the large cat ejecting a large, clearly fake stool onto the stage. (Though the host throwing the turd at the jumpy judges was A-OK for TV.) Reactions on YouTube range from confused to delighted to horrified, one commenter calling the bit \"the tiniest talent I've ever seen.\" But it's the laughter that Spontaneous Art is going for, and they certainly got it with Lucky the cat, loving every moment. Though specifically requested by America's Got Talent producers to appear on the show after they heard about it through the grapevine, Lucky isn't just for television. The impressively well built, elephant-sized Tuxedo feline also pops up at events and festivals, always bringing people together to laugh, marvel, and share in this absurd and fleeting moment. To quote Spontaneous Art's website, \"Life is a temporary event.... After participating with us, we hope people are quicker to take social risks, question their self-imposed rules, permit themselves more freedoms and live out their days with more spontaneity.\" The Smithsonian American Art Museum had this to say about their visit: \"Arguably one of the most intriguing, enjoyable, and unexpected activities.... I know you provided many people with life long memories about a truly unusual, but wonderful, museum experience.\" Each of the trio's \"interactive, social performance[s],\" which often include elaborate handcrafted costumes, \"requires months of work,\" says Berry. This is clearly a labor of love. (Detailed pictures and videos are available on their website, spontaneousart.org.) But Berry doesn't just do performance art. When her brother unexpectedly passed away, Berry turned to painting as a way of dealing with her grief. This eventually began to feel like too solitary an activity and, she found, deepened that feeling of loss. Partnering with Stone and Sandon, Berry felt invigorated by art, and their road trips together forged deep friendships. Berry, who is \"always working to find satva or balance between high energy and low,\" recently completed a training course on teaching trauma sensitive yoga. An essential trauma recovery tool is learning to calm the mind and body. For thousands of years, people have used yoga to decrease stress, focus their minds, and improve their overall physical and emotional health. The Trauma Center at Justice Resource Center in Brookline, Massachusetts, agrees that the best instructor for trauma sensitive yoga is positive, self-assured, engaging, welcoming, and someone who encourages students to create their own experiences. Berry believes that yoga \"can be a beautiful practice,\" but also \"can quickly get too serious.\" She is all about \"playfulness and whimsy\" and laughs often during practice. Sounds like being a yogini and thumping around in a giant cat-suit aren't so dissimilar after all.

Local holistic health practitioner Linda Diane Feldt has started a new group for professionals: Ann Arbor Area Holistic and Integrative Practitioners (A3HIP). Organized via Facebook, A3HIP meets for lunch on the third Thursday of each month. Feldt is clear about the purpose of the group. The Facebook description states: \"Our purpose is to be educational and to build community. Please feel free to introduce yourself; please refrain from buying, selling, and advertising your practice. Networking will be great. Please don't post any client details or client information. Asking broad questions about techniques and practice is great.\" Feldt said that the idea was in part inspired by another group she has belonged to for years: A2B3 (Ann Arbor Bi Bim Bop), which meets for weekly lunches to socialize and talk about technology. She has organized similar groups in the past, \"but not since the 80s.\" She explained that not only has the number of holistic practitioners increased greatly over the last 30 years, but so has the variety and scope of the holistic modalities, themselves. Feldt noted that many doctors, psychotherapists, and others nowadays consider themselves to be holistic practitioners, whereas in the 1980s, the holistic professional crowd was made up almost entirely of body workers. When asked why she decided to start A3HIP , Feldt mentioned several reasons. Among them, she noted, \"We need to be more connected, and building community is always a good thing.\" She added, \"If it wasn't fun there would be no point in doing This ongoing column features upcoming events within Ann Arbor/Washtenaw County and surrounding areas' Body/Mind/Spirit communities, new (during the past year or two) practitioners and holistic businesses, new books written by local/regional authors, new classes, as well as new offerings by established practitioners and holistic businesses. The last Saturday of each month from May through September is Kids Day at White Lotus Farms. This is the third year the farm has offered this fun family event. White Lotus is a 15-acre working farm, just a few minutes from downtown Ann Arbor on Liberty Road. It consists of the farm, which grows vegetables and flowers, a small herd of goats, a bakery, and a creamery, which makes cheese and other products from their milk. Kids Days run from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on May 31, June 28, July 26, August 30, and September 27. Activities include face painting, live music, games, and goat milking demonstrations at 10:30 a.m. and noon. Children can also meet adult and baby goats as well as chickens and ducks, and feed the fish in the koi pond at the farm. This year, the farm will also begin selling pizza at lunch time. The farm's product's will also be available for sale \u2014 fresh produce, eggs, honey, artisanal breads, and goodies like cookies and brownies, and, of course, fresh goat cheese and even goat's milk soaps. Beginning May 17, the farm will be open for sales each Saturday.What's New in the Community By Lynda Gronlund The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 12 \"We need to be more connected, and building community is always a good thing.\" -- Linda Diane Feldt, about the new professional group, Ann Arbor Area Holistic and Integrative PractitionersNew Offerings by Established Businesses and Practitioners Kids Days at White Lotus Farms include face painting, live music, games, and goat milking demonstrations at 10:30 a.m. and noon.

Photo by Joni Strickfadenthis.\" She is currently working on a book, based on her many years in practice, on ethics in alternative healthcare. This is one of the discussions she hopes will be ongoing in the group and in the community of holistic practitioners. In any group of related professionals, some might feel competitive with one another, but Feldt said that the increase in practitioners has only ever improved her business, not hurt it. She explained that each new practitioner brings new people into the community of people who seek holistic options, and that there is \"no need for competition.\" She describes the group as \"very egalitarian,\" without any type of hierarchy. A3HIP currently has approximately 60 members, and its first lunch, on one of the very cold and snowy days of February, had five attendees. The group is growing on its own now, by word of mouth among professionals, rather than personal invitation from Feldt, which was how it began. (Editor's Note: Linda Diane Feldt is well-known to long-time readers of the Crazy Wisdom Community Journal . She is one of Ann Arbor's most well-respected herbalists, and she is also recognized for her work as a Cranialsacral and Polarity Therapist. She has written columns for us on ethical issues for holistic care providers, and we've covered the publication of two of her books: Spinach and Beyond: Loving Life and Dark Green Leafy Vegetables, and Dying Again: Thirteen Years of Writing and Waiting . She is also former President of the Board of the People's Food Co-op.) A3HIP is organized on Facebook: www.facebook.com/groups/A3HIP/. Practitioners can get involved by joining the group or by contacting Linda Diane Feldt at ldf@lindadianefeldt.com to become a part of the group's email list. In November of 2013, local author and founder of The Early Learning Foundation, Bob Sornson, published his third children's book about bullying: It's Time to Stand Up and Speak Up for Yourself and Others . The author's previous books, The Juice Box Bully and Stand in My Shoes: Kids Learning about Empathy, have been immensely popular. The latter was the bestselling book on Amazon.com in the category of empathy, even among books written for adults. The new book is the story of a girl who is targeted by bullies but knows how to stand up for herself, and has a group of friends who also know how to stand up for her, and do. In talking about his work on bullying, Sornson said that the solutions adults have come up with to reduce bullying \u2014 more rules, harsher punishments, and even police involvement \u2014 don't go to the root of the problem. \"There will always be kids who try to bully, and there will always be some kids who are seen as victims,\" he said. \"The most important group is the group that creates culture.\" He explained that culture includes general agreements on how people treat one another. If it becomes socially unacceptable to bully, or to allow bullying to go unchallenged, bullying will become rare. He said he is trying to help \"create the opposite of a nation of bystanders.\" Parents and educators have used Sornson's books and have read them to children as young as three. Sornson said he would like the books to be preventative \u2014 reaching children before they have to deal with bullying situations, so that they have an idea what to do in response. Middle schools have even contacted him to get permission to stage the books as plays, which he has gladly granted. It's Time to Stand Up and Speak Up for Yourself and Others and Sornson's other books on bullying and empathy are available at Crazy Wisdom and online at shopcrazywisdom.com. Bob Sornson's email is bob@earlylearningfoundation.com . For more information about The Early Learning Foundation, visit www. earlylearningfoundation.com. Local authors Judy Powers and Linda Nicholas published their first co-authored novel, The Fairy Box, in December of 2013. Nicholas was inspired by Jonathan B. Wright's \"fairy doors,\" small colorful doors meant for fairies. Fairy doors can be seen in several Ann Arbor businesses (including a beautifully crafted fairy door at Crazy Wisdom). She brought the story idea to her friend, Powers, and the two went to work. The story follows 12-year-old Kate, who finds a magic box that no one can unlock. Though grieving the death of her mother and angry about her father's remarriage, Kate is compelled to solve the mystery of the box. The story leads her on an interesting quest in which she finds clues behind the fairy doors at several Ann Arbor businesses local residents will recognize: Zingerman's Deli, the Kerrytown Shops, Motte and Baily Booksellers, Washtenaw Dairy, and Vogel's Lock and Safe Locksmiths. The journey brings her closer to her stepmother, and brings Kate to a new level of maturity by the time she is able to open the box and discover the magic inside. In talking about his work on bullying, [author Bob] Sornson said that the solutions adults have come up with to reduce bullying \u2014 more rules, harsher punishments, and even police involvement \u2014 don't go to the root of the problem.

The event has grown from the original one-day retreat to a four-day weekend, with between 300 and 400 participants last year and more expected this time. Retreat goers can participate in a variety of yoga and movement classes for all levels of ability. Some of them are set to live music. Other activities and attractions include group and individual meditations from different traditions, a healing arts tent, workshops and hands-on projects in permaculture and sustainability, a children's area, creative spaces, and a vendor's area, which is new to the festival. Food vendors will make it easy to eat healthy and delicious vegetarian food all weekend long. Musical artists are still being planned as of press time, but will include Toronto-based Parvati of the multimedia show \"Yoga in the Nightclub,\" and Royal Oak's Vishnu Blue. Event manager Ashtar Kukuk said that in addition to planned activities, there will be plenty of free time to enjoy the 800 acres of woodland and water in the Pigeon River National Park, adjacent to Song of the Morning's ranch. Some of the sustainability projects will involve walks in the woods where participants can learn plant and mushroom identification and other outdoor skills. The ranch itself boasts miles of hiking trails and a variety of campsites for retreat participants, as well as some indoor accommodations that are available on a first-come, first-served basis for an additional cost. The retreat costs $140 and includes camping accommodations. The first 100 tickets will be sold at a reduced price of $120. Kukuk said that Yoga Fest is an opportunity to bond with the spiritual community of Michigan and the Midwest, connect with nature and a stewardship of Mother Earth, and experience new aspects of yoga and the yoga lifestyle. Song of the Morning Yoga Retreat is located at 9607 Sturgeon Valley Road, Vanderbilt, Michigan 49795.

On June 2, local natural death care educators and advocates Diana Cramer and Merilynne Rush will host a screening of A Will for the Woods at the Michigan Theatre, as part of their ongoing effort to increase awareness about Green Burial and home funerals. Green Burial is a return to simple ways of caring for and interring our dead. Rush explained that modern embalming techniques were created during the American Civil War, because of the need to transport bodies over long distances back to their families. Prior to this, families tended to care for their own loved ones at death and bury them in family cemeteries. Now, Americans almost always pay others for these services. Funerals have become huge and pricey; caskets are fancy and expensive and claim to help preserve the body forever; and burials are done with concrete grave liners to \"prevent the elements from entering.\" (Rush said they don't really work). With a new interest in environmentalism and in reducing consumerism, 42 percent of Americans now say they want to be cremated rather than buried, Rush said, but there is a great lack of knowledge about the environmental cost of the emissions from this process and about any other options. \"Ninety-nine percent of the problem is lack of knowledge, The story is aimed at girls ages 9 to 14, and will hold special interest for children who have lost a parent or who are adjusting to a stepfamily. Both authors have known children close to them who have lost a parent, and Powers was very receptive when Nicholas suggested the story as a way of helping children who are grieving. The pair is working on a sequel to the story called The Training of Mirabella , which they plan to publish in the summer of 2014. The Fairy Box is available at Crazy Wisdom and online at shopcrazywisdom.com. For information about the book and its forthcoming sequel, visit www.thefairyscrolls.com. Judy Powers can be reached via email at judypd@comcast.net or by phone at (248) 404-7835. Local writer Madeline Diehl published Wrestling with Angels , a book of poems with the theme of love and healing, in the fall of 2013 . The book almost didn't happen, Diehl explained. She was struggling with the personal nature of the poems and whether she really wanted them out there for people to read, when a man she had never spoken to before called to tell her how much one of her previously published poems (\"The Lightness of the Human Condition,\" published in the Quaker publication Friends Journal ) had affected him. Diehl then made the decision to publish Wrestling with Angels despite her discomfort, in hope that the poems would be helpful to more people. She had already received a lot of positive feedback about her poem \"Lightness,\" which is about how the pain we all experience gets lighter when we recognize that our own pain and fear is not greater or less than anyone else's. This realization was a breakthrough in her own healing journey, said Diehl. \"Things happen when they're supposed to happen,\" she said, and the well-timed phone call about \"Lightness\" helped her make the decision to share the poems in Wrestling with Angels with the world. \"I wasn't going to care what people think about me anymore,\" she said. \"We're meant to share ourselves and love each other.\" Despite the heavy themes of the book, humor runs through the poems as a natural part of Diehl's style. \"[Humor] is the way through the dark things in life,\" she said. A Quaker who had converted from her upbringing as a Roman Catholic, Diehl explained that many of the poems were inspired by \"messages\" she delivered in Quaker meetings: \"In an unprogrammed meeting like Ann Arbor's, Quakers/Friends worship in the silence, in a spirit of expectant waiting. If someone feels led to speak, they silently put themselves through a process of 'testing' that leading and the words of the message; then, if they still have the leading, they rise to deliver the message. In this way Quakerism is a mystical encounter with the divine/Light, as it relies on each person's inner Light and leadings.\" Dr. Max Heirich, University of Michigan Professor Emeritus and 40-year explorer and consultant in holistic health and social and personal transformation, said of Diehl's book: \"Madeline's writings testify to the fact that healing does not fall from the sky, but rather comes by tirelessly opening up our hearts and ourselves, and accepting with reverence whatever we find there.\" Wrestling with Angels is available at Crazy Wisdom and online at shopcrazywisdom. com.

Upcoming Events Yoga Fest is an opportunity to bond with the spiritual community of Michigan and the Midwest ... and experience new aspects of yoga and the yoga lifestyle. Merilynne Rush and Diana Cramer are working to spread the word about how families, churches, funeral directors, graveyard owners, and others can help with more environmentally friendly, less expensive, and more personal practices. The Dancing Dog Gallery in downtown Ann Arbor is hosting several exhibits this summer, including one where the public will be asked to submit art . Featured artist exhibit \"Spreading Color \u2014Vibrant Impressions of Nature,\" watercolors by Missy Cowan, will be on display through May 17. Sarah Clark Davis's show of painting, sculpture, and assembled work with a theme of fertility will be featured from May 18 through June 28, and a reception will be held on May 30 from 7 to 10 p.m. From June 29 to July 13, the gallery will feature \"Broken,\" a traveling social art installation by Susan Clinthorne, which demonstrates a theme of human trafficking through handmade dolls with wings trapped in birdcages. For the end of summer, from July 20 to August 16, the gallery will host a \"call for art,\" and will hold a reception on July 25. Artists in the community are encouraged to submit pieces for inclusion in the show. Directions on how and what to submit will be available on the gallery's website. Matruka Sherman, who is the President of the co-op that runs the gallery, said the gallery's founding artists are \"very excited about the 'call to art.'\" They feel it will help fulfill their mission statement in making the gallery more accessible to all.

It's not impossible, though, and Rush and Cramer are working to spread the word about how families, churches, funeral directors, graveyard owners, and others can help with more environmentally friendly, less expensive, and more personal practices. The two women host the \"Death Caf\u00e9\" at Crazy Wisdom's Tea Room, which is a free event held monthly (keep an eye on the Crazy Wisdom calendar for summer dates) for frank discussion and questions about death, and practices surrounding it. A Will for the Woods is a documentary about Chinese-American psychiatrist, Clark Wang, who is dying from lymphoma. His interest in Green Burial resulted in a new natural burial ground in a section of forest next to a cemetery in Wake Forest, North Carolina. Rush said the film is \"a must-see for anyone interested in alternatives to conventional, commercial funerals.\" There will be a post-screening Q&A with local experts. Advance tickets are available at www.michtheater.org/shows/a-will-for-the-woods/. Rush is also organizing the \"Green Burial Conference: Exploring Issues and Options,\" to take place October 11, 2014, at Matthaei Botanical Gardens in Ann Arbor. The aim of this conference is to bring together consumers and providers and create more local options for green(er) burial. Speakers will include experts on Green Burial and home funerals, and attendees will learn about the practicalities of how to do a natural burial.

Move, a mind-body fitness and wellness studio, opened in March near the Quality 16 Theater on Jackson Road on the west side of Ann Arbor. Owner Elaine Economou explained that the studio's mix of private and group exercise options, massage, wellness coaching, and retail was inspired when she was working in the smaller downtown studio, The Movement Center. Many of the 23 people who worked at The Movement Center now work at Move. The space was small, and Economou envisioned a bigger studio with room for more diverse offerings that would fulfill her vision of a complete center for \"fitness, wellness, inspiration, and community.\" One year before the new studio opened, Economou said that she and business partner Robin Krienke, who worked together at The Movement Center, bonded over personal tragedy. Their fathers died one day apart. They had been talking for a while about their vision for a more complete fitness and health center, and it was then that Economou asked, \"What am I waiting for?\" So the pair started working on a plan. Aimee McDonald-Anderson, now a master trainer at Move, was the owner of The Movement Center and was very supportive of Economou and Krienke's vision. She said that she had never had a great need to own a business; she just wanted to be able to bring the Gyrokinesis\u00ae and Gyrotonic\u00ae system to people who would benefit from it. Gyrotonic\u00ae and Gyrokinesis\u00ae are mainstays of Move's offerings. Economou explained that Gyrotonic\u00ae is a fitness practice that helps move and strengthen the spine in all ranges of motion, including decompression. Dancers love the practice as it helps them stay flexible and strong, and retain complete range of spinal motion. Gyrokinesis\u00ae is a group-taught version of Gyrotonic\u00ae. Economou also teaches Pilates, a core-strengthening practice also favored by dancers. Move currently has 12 private trainers, many of whom also offer group classes, including Pilates, Gyrokinesis\u00ae, dance, Total Barre, yoga, and Shred60 and Shred90 \u2014 Move's own proprietary fitness mix. Shred60 and Shred90 include training with the Bosu Balance Trainer (a half-ball with a hard plastic base) and the TRX (a set of straps and handles allowing the user to perform various exercises partially suspended from the floor). The studio also boasts three massage therapists, four wellness coaches, and one life coach. There is a juice bar, a \"conscious clothing\" section, and a skincare section. Enconomou said that her desire was to \"pull together different facets of wellness as a lifestyle.\" The studio's tagline, \"be fit, be well, be inspired,\" sums up her ambition for the space. Move is located at 3780 Jackson Road, Suite K, Ann Arbor 48103. Potential clients can book sessions and classes online at www.movewellness.com. Contact the studio by email at office@movewellness.com or by phone at (734) 761-2306. Michigan residents Wen Chen, Priya Koteeswaran, and Barbara Hernandez recently completed extensive training at the Isha Hata Yoga School in Coimbatore, South India, and will now offer training in Classical Hata Yoga in the Lansing, Metro Detroit, and Ann Arbor areas. The word hata comes from the words \"ha\" \u2014 sun, and \"ta\" \u2014 moon, and Hernandez explained that the practice is focused on balancing the \"sun and moon\" in its practitioners. She described it as \"less a studio practice and more an internal/personal practice.\" Hata is taught in workshops instead of ongoing classes (though some may do some follow-up classes with teachers), and it is performed almost entirely with the eyes closed. Hernandez said that this means the practitioner must \"rely on the internal self to perfect the practice.\" The benefits of a Hata practice, explained Hernandez, include physical conditioning and weight loss, stabilization and balancing of the body, relief of chronic ailments, and a slowed aging process. She said that it also \"opens the body and mind to higher possibilities.\" Teachers complete a rigorous 1,750-plus hour training program, which includes anatomy, physiology, yogic physiology, traditional Indian medicine, and yogic principles and lifestyle. Hernandez said that while most yoga practiced in the United States is viewed as an exercise program only, Hata yoga \"brings forth the original purpose of yoga: to help one experience the fundamental nature of the existence.\" Hernandez, Koteeswaran, and Chen will be leading Hata Yoga workshops monthly. Dates and locations will be announced as they are finalized on the website at www.ishafoundation.org/us/hatayoga. People interested in the workshops can also contact Barbara Hernandez at (517) 214-9671 or isha.barb@gmail.com. Melissa Neill, R.N., created \"Baby Basics\" this year and will provide childbirth classes, baby massage classes, and postpartum support visits to expectant and new parents. Neill completed her degree at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, and worked as a registered nurse in England (for eight years) before moving to Ann Arbor six years ago. In the United States, Neill has focused on caring for her own two children and volunteer work, as well as achieving certification as a childbirth educator and birth doula though the Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association (C.A.P .P .A.) and as an infant massage instructor through the Loving Touch Foundation. She is currently pursuing certification as a Lactation Educator, also through C.A.P .P .A. Regarding her childbirth preparation classes, Neill said, \"I feel having someone show kindness, understanding, and compassion to women at this very special time is immensely important. Many women remember their birth experience for a very long time, which is why we try and give research-based evidence to help couples have the best experience they can.\" The classes focus not only on the mechanics of childbirth but also on the importance of position changes during labor to help facilitate the birthing process. Neill also teaches relaxation techniques for the laboring mother and her support person, and helps the support person find ways to assist Mom during labor and birth. Of infant massage, Neill said that the practice is an excellent way for caregivers to bond with babies and includes many benefits, such as enhancing social, emotional, and cognitive development, as well as relaxation for both the giver and receiver. It can also provide relief of gas and colic, better sleep, and a reduction in excessive crying. It helps the caregiver better recognize and understand the baby's cues, and can provide fathers with a special time to connect with the baby. Neill will offer several classes at Life's Journey Family Chiropractic on Jackson Road this summer. She will offer a four-week baby massage course from 12:00 to 1:00 p.m. on Mondays. The start dates are May 5, June 3, and August 4. The course will also be offered on four Tuesdays, with a start date of July 1. In addition, Neill will conduct childbirth preparation classes in four-week sessions, with start dates of May 1 and June 5. Classes will take place from 12:00 to 1:00 p.m. Condensed two-week classes will be offered from 6:00 to 8:30 p.m., with start dates of July 17 and August 31. On June 28 and August 2, Neill will host workshops on active childbirth at Crazy Wisdom.

A first generation Italian immigrant, Hornyak explained that while she and her brother Arturo were growing up in the United States, their mother would use just a few high-quality ingredients to make a variety of dishes. This kept the cost of feeding the family down and allowed her to provide quick, simple, and delicious meals. The simplicity allowed the flavor of the ingredients to really come through, explained Hornyak. Arturo and Anna both grew up passionate about this philosophy of food. Arturo put his vision into action early on, founding Arturo's Pizza Kitchen, which has been well-known in the Toledo area for over 20 years. Anna first pursued a successful career in human resources, and then, in 2012, decided to bring her own dream of providing fresh, authentic Italian food to busy families in Ann Arbor, but with a different concept. Pescara Handcrafted Foods offers freshly made lasagna, pasta, soups, breads, and desserts. All are made by hand with no added preservatives, and each recipe is limited to five or six ingredients of the highest quality. Hornyak explained that this keeps the flavors from being \"overwhelmed with a bunch of different junk,\" and keeps the meals healthier than manufactured foods. Meals can be warmed (microwave or conventional method) at home and can be stored in the fridge or frozen. Hornyak explained that as a busy mom, herself, she wanted to make it easy for families to get a healthier dinner on the table. Hornyak had another reason for wanting to keep the recipes simple. Inspired by her 20-year-old son, Joey, who has Down syndrome and is working on becoming independent, she wanted to build Pescara as a business that would be able to employ him as well as others with varying ability levels. Recently, a young woman with a disability began working for Pescara for a few hours each week as a part of a local job training program, assisting with making the food. Hornyak said it is working out very well. She hopes to eventually increase the business's volume enough to employ more people. Currently, Hornyak runs Pescara with her business partner, Karen Tadd, and one part-time employee. Joey works with his uncle at Arturo's in Toledo, and Hornyak hopes he will eventually be able to work at Pescara, closer to home. Pescara's original concept was to deliver food orders to places busy families frequented \u2014daycare centers, after-school activities, and the like \u2014 and continues this to an extent, but Hornyak explained that orders were not consistent enough to make it the sole mode of operation. Now, she has opened a small storefront in the Saline Senior Center, and is working with local small businesses to increase Pescara's reach. Coffeehouse Creamery on Jackson road carries her biscotti, and she is talking with various specialty food markets in the area about carrying the products. \"We want to stay local,\" she said. Giving back to the community is also a big part of Hornyak's vision for the business. On March 21, which is World Down Syndrome Day, Pescara donated the proceeds from certain sales for the week to support the Down Syndrome Support Team of Ann Arbor. She plans to support other charitable causes with fundraisers in the future. Of her career change, Hornyak said she is following her passion and doing what she loves to do.

The storefront is in the Saline Area Senior Center at 7190 S. Maple Street, Saline 48176. What's New in the Community Continued from page 16 Ellen Abramson started her new business, Money Mindfulness, in the summer of 2013. She began her own journey toward peace with money years ago, when she was talking with her hair stylist, who had just been in a car accident. Her hairstylist said she wasn't too worried about the cost because she had an emergency fund that should cover the damage to the car. Abramson said that she seemed to be very at peace about the situation, and asked how she had done it. The stylist introduced her to the work of Dave Ramsey, a financial author and teacher who, through his books and courses, helps average people to get out of debt and build wealth. Abramson bought Ramsay's book The Total Money Makeover and got started taking care of her own finances. Over the next five years, she and her husband paid off $90,000 in non-mortgage debt and were able to invest in their small business while not accruing additional debt. Together they took several courses through Ramsey's Financial Peace University. Eventually Abramson went on to facilitate several Financial Peace University courses. In 2013, a friend of hers confided her feelings of despair over her financial situation. She was deep in debt and felt stuck and powerless, unable to get ahead. Abramson offered to sit down with her to look at the numbers, and within two hours, they had a plan to get her out of debt in two to three years. Her friend felt empowered about her situation, instead of feeling she was at the bottom of a hole she could never dig out of. Abramson explained, \"If you don't have goals for your money, you can be sure your credit card companies, banks, and department stores do.\" She recognizes, though, that it's often hard to figure out what to do yourself. She said that once she started taking small steps and making plans for her money, she got to feel like she was winning, rather than just watching the money fly out of her wallet. Making the initial decision to get in control of your money can be very difficult, especially if you're doing it by yourself, she said. She found that once she had a plan, it was much easier to pass up the inevitable opportunities to spend money. With experience as a social worker, Abramson brings a unique touch to the process of helping people design their budgets, pay off debt, and save for their goals. She said that sometimes she just \"gives them permission to do something they know they have needed to do.\" In other cases, it helps just to have someone else present to \"see the numbers with new eyes.\" There is a lot of fear around money, she said, and having someone else to help navigate can be very helpful as people try to become more mindful of their financial situation. Abramson, herself, said she now feels very peaceful and empowered about her finances, and loves to share her knowledge and skills to help others get that feeling. Of the \"mindfulness\" part of her business name, Abramson said, \"You can control what your money does.\" Most people don't want to think about it, and that's why many have so many problems with debt, living above their means, and not saving for the future. To people struggling with a low income who fear they don't have the ability to pay down debt or save, she advises, \"Awareness is always better than lack of awareness. You can always exert more control than you think you can.\" Those interested in working with Abramson on budgeting, paying off debt, and saving can expect a two-hour consultation, with the possibility of follow-ups for fine-tuning as they form the necessary habits. Upon making the appointment, Abramson explains everything to bring (banks statements and so on) to make the session most valuable. Ellen Abramson can be reached by email at ellen@northcoastbanners.com or phone at (734) 476-9948. Paul Hess, Ph.D., who recently moved back to Michigan from California, formed Primal Rejuvenation, a nutrition and health consulting practice, in 2012. His own experience with chronic fatigue and mercury poisoning led him to a years-long search for relief, and Hess said that ultimately he discovered that there are five root causes of chronic fatigue and its symptoms: nutritional deficiency, toxicity, infections, deep emotional stress, and problems with body posture and movement. Hess had problems with all five. He found that he had to be his own guide to a \"complete solution\" to his health problems, as his healing had many factors, and no one doctor or practitioner seemed to be able to fully address his problems.

Anna and Joey Hornyak The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 19 Through nutritional education and support, he can help clients with the first three causes \u2014 nutritional deficiency, toxicity, and infections \u2014 by teaching them the best foods to eat and what high-quality supplements to use. He explained that food is the best source of nutrition, and that supplements should be used when one can't get enough of the necessary nutrients from food. He said that many supplements are not of good quality and that many people are using them incorrectly, even causing themselves harm. He advised that it is important to take small steps in improving nutrition and detoxifying the body. Moving too fast can cause adverse reactions and is not helpful in finding out exactly what is working for someone. Sometimes, though, clients can find immediate improvement, just by taking a mineral they are lacking, at the first session with him. Clients tend to have an initial consultation with Hess and a series of follow-up sessions. \"It's a big change in habits and thinking,\" he said, \"and that takes time and adjustment.\" He also speaks to groups and businesses about nutrition and detoxification. In addressing the other two causes of chronic fatigue, emotional stress and posture/ movement problems, Hess refers to and works with other providers who specialize in these areas. He said it is important to not expect a quick miracle but rather to stick with the necessary changes to relieve chronic fatigue. It takes time to incorporate the changes, and for the body to heal and become stronger. Primal Rejuvenation is online at www.primalrejuvenation.com. Paul Hess can be reached at hess.paulc@gmail.com. While he works and lives in Plymouth, he does travel to Ann Arbor to see clients and also works via Skype. ### Please note that the \"What's New\" column is part of the editorial (not paid-for advertising) part of the journal, and the editors may or may not include what you submit.

What follows are profiles of two interesting businesses that are thriving despite the odds. By Mary RunserPhotos by Susan Ayer ELITE CLEANERS II Green Cleaning for a Simpler, Healthier Life Sang Park, ownerElite Cleaners II, 4065 Stone School Road, Ann Arbor 48108; (734) 975-0546 Sang Park came to the United States in 1979 from Seoul, South Korea. His high school sweetheart and future wife, Chong, had come to the States ahead of him in 1974 with family. \"We came to the United States just to have a better life,\" Park explained. Chong went to work for General Motors in the powertrain plant, while her husband went into the dry cleaning business. Park took over ownership of Dutch Maid on East Michigan Avenue in Saline, Michigan, in September of 1980 \u2014 just 10 months after coming to the states. Experience in the dry cleaning business and a desire to move toward a healthier way of laundering clothes eventually led him to open Elite Cleaners in August of 2004. To understand Elite Cleaners' healthy approach to cleaning clothes, let's begin with a small history lesson. In ancient Rome, woolen togas were cleaned with ammonia derived from urine and Fuller's earth, a clay material capable of decolorizing oils without the use of chemical treatment. Most often, animal urine was used, although special collection pots were also placed in public latrines. Any town of notability had at least one Fullonicae, or laundry facility. These were prominent industrial businesses and often the largest employers in a district. And yes, the government taxed collected urine! Jump ahead a bit to the mid-19th century when French dye-works owner Jean Baptiste Jolly discovered that his tablecloth became cleaner after his maid spilled kerosene on it. Thus was born not only the concept of using petroleum-based products to clean clothes (a bit more appealing than urine) but also a new service called nettoyage \u00e0 sec, or dry cleaning, which Jolly operated through his dye-works company. Dry cleaning is defined as a cleaning process for clothing and textiles using a chemical solvent other than water. As one could imagine, with the original methods, flammability issues arose when petroleum-based cleaning agents were combined with the heat of drying garments. Actually, the use of highly flammable solvents caused many fires and explosions \u2014 one of the major reasons why customers were asked to drop their clothes off and pick them up at a later time. Clothes were often transported to a factory/warehouse setting to reduce the risk of injury to customers should fires and explosions occur. As a result, dry cleaners became heavily regulated by the government. Chong and Sang Park \"You might ask why I chose this profession. The answer is easy. I meet such a variety of people when they walk through the doors here \u2014 teachers, lawyers, athletes \u2014 and I take the time to talk to all of them.\" - Sang ParkThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 25 William Joseph Stoddard, an Atlanta dry cleaner, developed the Stoddard Solvent, which was slightly less flammable than petroleum-based cleaning agents. After World War I, many dry cleaners adopted the use of chlorinated cleaning solvents because they were much less flammable and had better cleaning power. In the mid-1930s, the dry cleaning industry adopted the use of perchloroethylene, a gentler and more stable, non-flammable alternative. Perchloroethylene, or PERC, is still widely used today throughout the dry cleaning industry. When Park opened his first dry cleaning business in 1980, he also used PERC. \"It was the safest and most effective approach to cleaning at that time. But it was also very expensive because of all the regulations the government placed on the chemicals and especially their disposal,\" he explained. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declared PERC a carcinogen and strengthened its regulations concerning the disposal of the solvent. It mandated PERC be handled as hazardous waste in order to reduce the risk of contaminating groundwater, and at the same time, drove up the cost of doing business for owners. \"Then the States began to mandate that each dry cleaning establishment be certified in the use and disposal of the toxic chemicals,\" Park said. \"That added another monetary weight to the business owner.\" Today, there are other alternatives for cleaning fabrics, such as glycol ethers, hydrocarbons, liquid silicone, modified hydrocarbon blends, brominated solvents, liquid CO 2's, and finally, \"wet cleaning,\" or green cleansing, which is how Park now works his magic with clothing. Considered by the EPA to be the safest professional method of garment cleaning, wet cleaning employs a gentle washing machine and biodegradable soaps and conditioners. It creates no hazardous waste or air pollution. Park uses water and SoyClean, a cleaning agent made from soy bean citrus extract. \"It's a very gentle detergent, safe for all kinds of fabrics, with a pleasant, clean scent,\" he said. When you walk through the doors of Elite Cleaners, you will recognize your surroundings by what you see rather than what you smell. The light citrus scent is a pleasant change from the ordinary scent you might experience at a dry cleaners. \"The most difficult part is educating and convincing my customers that their gentle fabrics can be washed in water.\"(\"Dry cleaning\" simply means the absence of water in the process, not that clothing is actually cleaned while dry.) The key, as Park explained, is that the water temperature is only 38 degrees, which helps prevent shrinkage and color from fading. Beyond that, while the Italian-made Feori machine Park uses is large and looks powerful, he explained that it's even milder than washing your gentle clothes at home with Woolite. The only drawback to this process is that it takes longer to wash and press out the wrinkles. Though one might expect a price increase with the use of these eco- friendly cleaning agents, there is actually none passed along to the customer. \"My prices are comparable to other cleaners in the area,\" Park said. Since he does not use any toxic chemicals, he does not have to maintain certification through the state or have to pay chemical disposal fees. He explained that wet washing has taken off in Europe and in California, and is beginning to catch on in other parts of the country. Park, however, is the first in Michigan to turn to wet washing and, so far, the only one to do so in Ann Arbor. Park has gained a customer base that extends to Brighton, Battle Creek, and beyond. \"Some of our customers UPS their clothing to us when they know they are going to be in town, and pick it up from us before they go back home.\" The entrepreneur credits this success to treating people fairly and with respect, and doing a good job. \"You might ask why I chose this profession,\" Park said. \"The answer is easy. I meet such a variety of people when they walk through the doors here \u2014 teachers, lawyers, athletes \u2014 and I take the time to talk to all of them.\" In a time when technology rules supreme, perhaps that small amount of real, face-to-face contact with another human being helps brighten the day. Park and his wife have recently celebrated their 34th wedding anniversary. Chong, now retired from General Motors, works alongside her husband. They've raised three children and put them through college. \"I just paid my youngest daughter's last tuition payment,\" Park said, with more than a little pride. \"It's a good feeling.\" All in all, the high school sweethearts made good on their plan to have a better life. \"I have no plans to expand,\" Park said. \"If I were a younger man, perhaps.\" ### [In the early days of dry cleaning,] the use of highly flammable solvents caused many fires and explosions \u2014 one of the major reasons why customers were asked to drop their clothes off and pick them up at a later time. ...\"Wet cleaning,\" or green cleansing, is how Park now works his magic with clothing.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 26 Gro Blue Indoor Gardening Supplies Helping People Grow Healthy Food Year Round Gigi Bennett and Ellen Pullen, owners Gro Blue, 4072 Packard Road, Ann Arbor 48108; (734) 913-2750; www.gro-blue.com Gigi Bennett and her mother, Ellen Pullen, own and operate Gro Blue in Ann Arbor, a specialty store dedicated to growing plants and vegetables and providing the equipment necessary to do so. As is often the case, our lives pull us in several directions all at once, leaving us little time to chase our dreams. The same is true for Gigi and Ellen. Ellen is a caregiver, an entrepreneur, a business partner, and a mother (though her children are grown). Gigi, too, has a loaded plate with three children, a partner to nurture, and a business to operate \u2014 and grow. Both women are learning to be more adept at handling those elements of their lives, while still finding the time to pursue their passion. Gigi's mother (Ellen) and brother opened Gro Blue when he had moved back to Ann Arbor from California. Gigi left her job in 2010 to join the family operation. \"I was lucky because my mom has always been an entrepreneur, and I often went to work along with her, so I had a bit of an understanding of what it takes to run a business,\" Gigi said. While born in Ann Arbor, Gigi's family lived in East Lansing for a time. Ellen started a daycare center there, and when Gigi was a child, she would frequently accompany her mother to work. Even though that is many years ago, that daycare is still in operation. \"We had very humble beginnings,\" Gigi explained. \"We began with a minimal start-up, and mom turned it into something quite a bit more substantial, but it's tough at times to keep it going.\" Both women now also apply their dedication to Gro Blue. The politics at play right now concerning the medical marijuana movement has had a significant influence on the flow of Gro Blue's business. \"Many of our customers are caregivers and grow marijuana for their patients,\" Gigi explained. \"While we are not and do not intend to become a dispensary, we make the necessary tools available that help provide that care.\" According to Gigi, Ellen had been a leading activist in Ann Arbor on the issue of medical marijuana. \"Mom has long been a supporter of the medical marijuana movement. Marijuana has many medicinal benefits and can definitely relieve the pain and suffering of people in chronic pain. I'm all for that,\" Gigi said. Gigi's real passion lies in the idea of people growing their own healthy foods and herbs: \"When you grow your own food, there is no need to worry about GMOs or toxic chemicals and pesticides.\" There's nothing quite like the taste of a ripe, juicy tomato that you've nurtured and grown on your own. The same goes for green beans, hot peppers, potatoes, green peppers, rosemary, thyme, sage, and basil. And freshly grown herbs are not only a delicious addition to vegetables and meats, but they also have a medicinal value to them. Chamomile, spearmint, peppermint, lemon grass, echinacea, eucalyptus, and a host of other herbs are commonly used to Leaps of Faith: Tales of Local Businesses Feature continued from page 25 \"I was lucky because my mom has always been an entrepreneur, and I often went to work along with her, so I had a bit of an understanding of what it takes to run a business.\" - Gigi Bennett Gigi Bennett The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 27 make teas, herbal remedies, and healing agents. \"I want to help people understand the healthy, restorative, and therapeutic value of good, clean food,\" Gigi explained. \"That's my goal; that's my passion.\" That has been the goal since Gro Blue's inception in 2009. \"It really was my brother's idea to draw from our own experience and passion for gardening to educate and empower people interested in indoor gardening,\" Gigi said. \"You can truly grow indoors all year round with the right equipment. It's a challenge to do, but it can be done because you can control the variables to create the right environment for healthy plant growth.\" Gro Blue carries all the products you need, from soil and containers to grow lights and fertilizer. You can stop in and talk to Gigi and Ellen, ask them some questions, tell them what your growing goals are, and let them direct you down the right path. Before you know it, you'll be growing the best vegetables, herbs, and even flowers in the neighborhood. Gigi would like to spread this knowledge to even more of the Ann Arbor community. \"I think it would be awesome to have classes and workshops on gardening, or perhaps a women's gardening guild,\" she said. \"We have vendors who are willing to come into the store to demonstrate their products and give instruction on how to begin container gardening indoors, or how to do urban gardening. There are all kinds of things to learn and talk about on the topic of gardening.\" As if on cue, a customer in the store asked a question about growing lavender because she'd been having \"You can truly grow indoors all year round with the right equipment. It's a challenge to do, but it can be done because you can control the variables to create the right environment for healthy plant growth.\" trouble with it. Gigi and I talked about our experiences with it, and the customer seemed happy to walk away with some fresh ideas to try. \"We started this business during a rough time,\" Gigi said. \"It's still rough and in a heavily male-dominated industry. I'm proud we're still here doing what we do.\" Gigi explained that most of the grow stores in the area are owned and operated by men. \"It's interesting because the atmosphere of the male owned and operated stores is completely different. I'm not saying it's a negative thing, it's just different. We're not the only women in this business, but we are two of the few, and it feels good to know that we're still here, we've survived.\" Growing up as the daughter of a woman who was both the first black homecoming queen and the first black cheerleader at Huron High School, and a woman who pushed hard for bringing books by black women to the school library, Gigi has always been inspired by her mother. \"Mom has always been an activist, out there doing things to help people, and she's inspired me to do the same. That's why we're doing this. If we can get people to understand the importance and fulfillment of growing your own food, we are helping them become healthier individuals. That's what we're here for.\" ### \"I want to help people understand the healthy, restorative, and therapeutic value of good, clean food. That's my goal; that's my passion.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 28 (Keith Copeland is the owner and head instructor at Quest Martial Arts in Ann Arbor. The photos on these pages were taken at Quest.) What is one thing we all have in common? What are three things that trouble each of us? What are the nine ways to resolve these quandaries? In my practice of ninjutsu over the past couple of decades, I have had the opportunity to explore these questions and find some answers. Ninjutsu is the 900-year-old martial art of the ninja. It is a full art that encompasses body positioning, striking, joint locks and throws, and ground defense. But the truly valuable aspects of the art are the parts that cannot be seen. This includes psychology, energy work, and mind and spirit training. I have discovered these aspects through my personal exploration as a student of ninjutsu and as the owner and head instructor at Quest Martial Arts in Ann Arbor, where we teach the ninja martial arts as a \"life skills laboratory.\" The One Thing We All Have in Common What we all have in common is that we are all human. Having said that, there are infinite varieties and variations of what it means to be human. Height, weight, complexion, hair color, skin color, mental status, whether you are an introvert or an extrovert, a vegetarian or meat eater \u2014 the list goes on. The commonness of being human means that we all have an ego. And it is designed to protect us and keep us safe. The ego operates on its own software. Its purpose is survival, so it looks at each situation as a potential threat to be dealt with (fear). It also looks at each situation as a potential opportunity for getting more of what it needs to be safe now and for increased potential to be safe in the future (selfishness). The Three Things That Trouble UsWhoever or whatever we are, we have three basic things that concern us: 1. Can w e feed ourselves? 2. Do w e have a place that can shelter us? 3. Do w e have other people around us for safety and comfort? So, the three things that trouble each of us are food, shelter, and community. Virtually everything the ego does is focused around these three things \u2014 fundamental survival considerations. We need food, a place to be safe, and people around us to create relationships and to increase the feeling of safety. There is \"safety in numbers.\" Even the best of us functions with these drivers, so our decisions tend to be from a \"me,\" \"my,\" and \"mine\" orientation. What would be best for \"me\"? There are many of us who operate from a too humble perspective. \"I don't deserve that.\" \"No, you go first.\" \"Let me make sure you have yours before I get mine.\" While it may be the polite and courteous thing to do, it also may be an attempt to be submissive, unobtrusive, or invisible so as to avoid danger \u2014 again, coming from a \"me\" and selfish perspective. The Solution is Enlightened Selfishness One of the many principles we learn through the practice of ninjutsu is Enlightened Selfishness. Enlightened Selfishness is the practice of having all you want while, and this is the critical point, making the world a better place. This principle addresses the issue of the ego trying to protect itself from danger and accumulating more to protect from future threats. Enlightened Selfishness and Ninjutsu By Keith Copeland Photos by Tobi Hollander NiNjutsu is the 900- year-old martial art of the NiNja. ...there are iNfiNite varieties aNd variatioNs of what it meaNs to be humaN. the truly valuable aspects of NiNjutsu are the parts that caNNot be seeN. this iNcludes psychology , eNergy work, aNd miNd aNd spirit traiNiNg . Ninjas practice control and focus to make targets go flying Students work on their weekly topic: balance Ninja students improve their postureThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 29 It also addresses an issue of the Spirit, or true self. None of us exist in isolation or a vacuum. In many ways we exist only in relation to the world around us. In Human Behavior and Organization Development theory, there is a model called the \"Action Research Model.\" Quite simply, it has four steps: 1. Plan 2. Do 3. Check 4. Act Basic ally, you have an assumption and you plan to take an action. You take that action. You check the results of that action to see if they are in line with your original plan and if they are taking you in the correct direction. Then you take actions based on what you discovered. The cycle repeats. This model is a good model to apply to your spiritual development. If you are trying to become the most perfect version of yourself possible, then you need to see other people in the world around you as a reflection of yourself. Indeed, there is a concept called \"projection.\" This theory states that the things that you are attracted to in others, as well as the things that irritate or frustrate you about others, are the exact things that you like, or are uncomfortable with, or dislike, about yourself. Enlightened Selfishness actually requires you to have more. More resources. More money. More social connections. More knowledge. More authority. You see, the more you have, the more you can share with others. The more resources you have, the more good you can do in the world. The more money you have, the more people you can employ or invest in. The more social connections you have, the more you can connect other people with the things they need. Enlightened Selfishness completely supports the ego. It protects you because it enables you to have more people around you who are connected to you and feel an affiliation with you. And the more people you can help in your community, the more those people will feel safe, secure, and less apt to be violent. From a spiritual point of view, you are cultivating compassion and service to others. You are also learning that differences between people are just opportunities for personal growth and leveraging each other's strengths. Nine Ways to Resolve the Quandary 1. Help y ourself 2. Help other s 3. R esolve conflict 4. Celebr ate differences 5. See y ourself and others 6. Look f or opportunities for leveraging yours and others' strengths 7. Build c ommunity 8. Embr ace your uniqueness 9. Embr ace the fact that you are not unique Enlightened Selfishness could possibly be the key to resolving your issues and your community's issues. It could also resolve the problems facing our nation and help the world wake up to the possibilities of truly supporting one another. Instead of seeing conflict, we could embrace cooperation and collaboration. Keith Copeland is the owner of Quest Martial Arts, which is located at 2111 Packard Street, Ann Arbor 48104.

Using their whole body, adult students practice applied defense techniques Two brothers commit to earning their Black Belts and rely on the support of the Quest Community Father and daughter apply their self-defense knowledgeThere is, of course, the need to make retirement plans (particularly financial) before one can decide upon a retirement date. There are retirement calculators online and financial planners eager to help with this task. Also, along the way, it was interesting to note others' reactions to my approaching retirement (though I was not going into \"full retirement,\" as I planned to keep my private psychotherapy practice). Friends were supportive, and colleagues at work had varied reactions: happy for me, sad I was leaving, and excited or anxious about their own upcoming or long distant retirements. As the time got closer, everyone wanted to know: What are you going to do? Any goals? I told them: Jammies and going with the flow. Many also wanted to know about plans for travel. Since I have traveled a lot already, I have no burning desire to travel more (except, of course, to visit my son in Oregon and my daughter in New York). Really, the only travel I am interested in now is inner travel. Day One and Beyond I was quite excited for day one, the first Monday in years I was not on the road to work at 7:30 a.m. There I was in my jammies at a very civilized 9:00 a.m., eating my Clif bar and ready to do what I, as a good Type A, had been longing to do for months: make a list of things to do. At last, \"The List.\" I made three columns of To Do's: This Week, This Month, and Parking Lot. All set! Not on The List were all of the things \"off the grid,\" those activities that would fall into the category of \"Play,\" like meditation, yoga, going out with friends, going to the gym \u2014 all manners of having fun and taking time out. After I finished The List, I worked off of it till noon, then had lunch and took a nap for three hours! With The List in hand, my marching orders as it were, I began to incorporate it and the newly available 50-odd hours per week into a retirement lifestyle. This did not mean becoming a totally new person, magically changed from Type A to Type B. No way. Now past day one, I am still gradually relaxing into having all this free time to get things done, have fun, and continue down my spiritual path, a path I have been on the last 30 some years. This includes a daily meditation and yoga practice, yoga classes at Yoga Focus, Reiki healing as part of my psychotherapy practice, and participation at the Lighthouse Center, Inc. The Lighthouse Center is a center for spiritual development in Whitmore Lake, founded by Chetana Catherine Florida, and under the spiritual guidance of Jain Master Gurudev Shree Chitrabhanuji. I am involved there with many activities the center has to offer as well as teaching meditation classes and presiding, for now, over the Board of Directors. The mission of the center is for \"inner peace and peace in the world, as we practice meditation and Ahinsa (non-violence),\" which includes a commitment to a vegan lifestyle. Balancing Work and Play Don't underestimate the value of Doing Nothing, of just going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not bothering. - from Pooh's Little Instruction Book by A. A. Milne Whether we are retired or not, we all have a need for structure (i.e., The List) and the need for lack of structure (Play). When some people think of retirement, they get uneasy or anxious about all the time they will have on their hands. Yes, it's nice not to be in rush hour traffic every morning, but what to do with all that free time? We often get a glimpse of this when we're on vacation and start to feel uneasy without a schedule. Some people then schedule up every free minute of vacation and come back home not refreshed or rejuvenated at all. The same can happen with retirement \u2014 staying so busy, or even busier than we were when we were working. One of my good friends warned me of this, insisting that I would be busier than ever. This may be especially true for all of us Type A's. You know who you are: competitive, ambitious, highly organized, managing time down to the minute, perfectionistic (some would say \"workaholic\"), impatient, easily irritated, and stressed out when things don't go your way. For Type A's, I recommend building some play time into each day of retirement. I also recommend an occasional \"Goof-Off Day,\" during which not a single productive thing is done. I stumbled upon my first \"Goof-Off Day\" about three months into retirement; one day I just did not feel like doing anything, certainly not anything off The List. I ended up goofing off, reading, answering emails, doing some Reiki, seeing a patient, even doing a load of laundry (clearly not all goofing off, but then again, this was just my first attempt at it). Now, Type B people already have learned this lesson, the value of doing nothing. Type B's are laid back, creative, and flexible, working steadily but not obsessively. They don't mind waiting their turn in line and can sometimes seem to be procrastinating. They are less concerned than Type A's about deadlines. For Type The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 30 Your life is a grand adventure. Take risks. Explore the unknown. Journey forth into the great wide open without preplanned outcomes. - from The Original Angel Cards Book by Kathy Tyler and Joy Drake This quote certainly applies to the phase of life we call retirement. One of my friends, who retired three years ago, checked in with me recently to see how retirement is going. I told her I loved it, and she said she thought I would. \"Every day is a new adventure,\" she said, even though she is now in the midst of chemotherapy and radiation for newly diagnosed breast cancer. I am inspired by how well she is able to go with the flow of whatever life brings. Every day a new adventure, indeed. Retirement is a new platform, a new vantage point from which to view ourselves. An opportunity to launch ourselves on a new trajectory, one that integrates our life until this point and opens us to the possibilities of who we would still like to become and what will happen to us. So how does one go about this \"project\" of retirement? Approaching Retirement I began my retirement countdown two and a half years out \u2014 first counting the months, then at one year changing to weeks, and in the last month counting the days. There are retirement countdown apps online, or you can just keep track on paper. This was a great inspiration and comfort to me as I wound my way slowly toward the magic day of retirement. You can start your own countdown at any time (my hairdresser just started hers at five years out). Others don't seem to need or want a countdown.Every Day a New Adventure Psychiatrist Nirmala Nancy Hanke, Meditation Teacher at the Lighthouse Center, on Retirement and Conscious Living By Dr. Nirmala Nancy Hanke Retirement is a new platform, a new vantage point from which to view ourselves. There I was in my jammies at a very civilized 9:00 a.m., eating my Clif bar and ready to do what I, as a good Type A, had been longing to do for months: make a list of things to do.Photos by Joni Strickfaden The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 31 B's, retirement may be easier to adapt to. On the other hand, they may worry about becoming too easy going or lazy, or not accomplishing anything. Also, in our breakneck culture, Type B's might feel they aren't keeping up with the pace, and when they retire, they may worry even more. Rat Race or Snail's Pace? Our already fast paced culture just keeps getting faster. How much more can be crammed into every day? How many texts, emails, phone calls, and even face-to-face encounters can we handle along with all the work, outside interests and obligations, and tasks of maintaining our lifestyles? We all know about burnout and feeling overwhelmed. Retirement is sometimes seen as an oasis, a refuge from all this frenzy. But one can easily carry his or her habits of speed at all costs right on into retirement. Do we want to continue with a rat race or go in search of a snail's pace? Or end up somewhere in-between? There are some cries in the wilderness about slowing down: downshifting, the Slow Movement, living simply. In fact, there is an American tradition of slowing down, beginning perhaps with Henry David Thoreau, in Walden. He proposed and lived out two principles: self-reliance and simplicity, both economic and spiritual, which he detailed in his two-year sojourn at Walden Pond. Downshifting is a strategy for moving toward a simpler life. Moving out of the rat race of obsessive materialism, perfectionism, and stress. Finding a balance between work and play. Slowing down the pace of life by becoming more conscious of one's actions and choices. Choosing what is meaningful, breaking the work-and-spend cycle, decreasing wasteful spending and accumulation. Must we all strive to be King Midas? How important really is collecting more and more things? Do these things make us happy? No. The Slow Movement is a cultural philosophy advocating a slower pace of life. Carl Honore's 2004 book, In Praise of Slowness: Challenging the Cult of Speed , first explored how the Slow philosophy might be applied in every field of human endeavor. Honore compares a Slow lifestyle with a fast one: Fast is busy, controlling, aggressive, hurried, analytical, stressed, superficial, impatient, active, quantity-over-quality. Slow is the opposite: calm, careful, receptive, still, intuitive, unhurried, patient, reflective, quality-over-quantity.... The Slow philosophy can be summed up in a single word: balance. Be fast when it makes sense to be fast, and be slow when slowness is called for. Seek to live at what musicians call the \"tempo giusto\" \u2014 the right speed. Simple living enc ompasses various voluntary practices to simplify one's lifestyle. There is a long tradition of living simply in both the West and the East: Diogenes in Greece, Francis of Assisi, Albert Schweitzer, Thoreau, the Amish, the Quakers, Lao Tzu, Buddha, the Jains, Gandhi. Whether on a spiritual or secular basis, living simply involves being satisfied with what we need rather than what we want. We don't have to become ascetic to start living more simply. We can begin with steps like these: Decreasing the number of possessions, by, for example, clearing out the basement. Choosing quality more, quantity less: Do I need this book, this computer app, this new outfit, this hectic schedule? Balancing work and play. Going with the flow. Going With the Flow \"Do what you want, when you want to.\" \"Just go with the flow,\" they say. This is easy to say, hard to do. There is the illusion that once retired, with all the attendant pressures, deadlines, and expectations from the full time job gone, one can naturally just do whatever one wants to, whenever. Just like that. What I am discovering, however, is that a lifetime of internalized pressures, deadlines, and expectations do not so easily retire. Going with the flow takes a conscious effort to gradually let go of these Type A habits and cultural expectations. I consciously make a daily exercise of balancing work and play, working with The List and going Off the Grid. Do I want to get things done this morning, or do I want to laze about? What is going with the flow anyway? What is the right thing to do, at any given moment? In the Tao Te Ching (#15, translated by Stephen Mitchell) , Lao Tzu asks: Do you have the patience to wait till your mud settles and the water is clear?Can you remain unmovingtill the right action arises by itself? Sometimes the right action arises easily. Going with the flow is good for work and play, for those unplanned moments that may \"interfere\" with the schedule, or transform it. Like the morning I woke up at 6:15, just in time to see Obama eulogizing Mandela at the memorial service in Soweto. Afterwards, I felt like writing about it. So I did. I hadn't written any poems for a long time, but this one just flowed: Continued on page 32Whether we are retired or not, we all have a need for structure (i.e., The List) and the need for lack of structure (Play). Our already fast paced culture just keeps getting faster.... Retirement is sometimes seen as an oasis, a refuge from all this frenzy.

The Ultimate Goal of Retirement: Letting Go As we each approach retirement, we may make plans for things we'd like to do, places we'd like to go. In western culture we are at once longing for retirement and afraid of it. Simone de Beauvoir put it this way: \"Retirement may be looked upon either as a prolonged holiday or as a rejection, a being thrown on the scrap-heap.\" We long for a \"prolonged holiday\" of enjoyment and ease, without the responsibilities, pressures, and expectations of work and adult life in general, yet we are afraid of no longer having the status or meaning that are associated with them.C. G. Jung offers another view: \"The first half of life is devoted to forming a healthy ego, the second half is going inward and letting go of it.\" We first form a healthy ego, which includes the responsibilities and achievements of adulthood, and then we allow ourselves to let all of that go \u2014 letting go of the ego as a transformation, an eventual preparation for death, the end of life. Regardless of one's religious or spiritual beliefs, we do all travel a path of gradual dissolution of the ego, the person we have become, to the person we will be on our last day. This occurs physically, whether we want it to or not, but it also occurs emotionally, cognitively, and spiritually. In all these spheres we still have choices we can make: whether to work to maintain our physical health or become a couch potato, exercise our mind or let it drift, withdraw from others or keep up family and social connections, follow a spiritual path or not. So we can think of retirement as a new platform, a time in our lives to launch ourselves every day on a new adventure that will bring us sooner or later to going with the flow, and letting go.

One study even found that conventional medicine was the leading cause of death in the United States. It's also impacting Americans financially. For many years, it has been the biggest cause of personal bankruptcy. My purpose in life is to help reverse this by bankrupting drug companies by getting lots of sick people well. While a chiropractic student, I went to two seminars a month for two years outside of school. I was searching for what heals a person's body quickly, effectively, permanently, and at the lowest cost. At one particular seminar, I \"got it\" when the speaker explained how a nutritional deficiency causes a symptom. Ah-ha! That's why Americans are so sick, I thought. Now as a chiropractor who focuses on nutrition, I do what the body needs to get healthy. I find the cause of the problem and fix that. This is the proper way to address long-term health problems rather than trying to erase symptoms with chemicals, which is what our conventional medical community does. Medications are needed to save lives after trauma and in emergency rooms, but for a condition that lasts more than three months or a non-life threatening condition, nutrition is the best tool to get rid of it. Ideally, all of us would do a little bit every day to improve our health, so there would be a large buffer between ourselves and disease. Getting rid of symptoms is actually an easy thing to do with nutrition. It's also easy with medications. But it's the rebuilding and correcting of the body's tissue that determines your future health. Using pills to manipulate how our body functions is the current state of disease and symptom care. Working with the body to help it heal is the smarter approach. When you feed the body the nutrients it wants, it starts to heal itself. The body is always trying to heal itself. It doesn't heal when there are barriers present. When we remove these barriers, we improve function. Barriers include toxins or the deficiency of nutrients. We want to help the body function the way it was designed. Proper functioning leads to less stress, less inflammation, less immune challenges, and less toxicity. Happiness is a result of being able to cope and adapt to the world without breaking down. What we are trying to establish or re-establish with nutritional healing is functionality. What we do is investigate: we look for what the body is doing compared to what it is designed to do. We look for the barriers to recovery, for the breakdown in function, and then we look for the quickest path back to proper function. The body was designed to be healthy and be able to adapt to the stress it encounters in life \u2014 whether that stress be chemical, emotional, or structural. Any breakdown in function breaks down our adaptability. And adaptation to the stress we encounter in life is our truest measure of immunity. We are feeding bodies, and they feel better without drugs. Take depression for instance. Conventional healthcare uses drugs to treat it, but there are dozens of causes of depression that may be alleviated with nutrition. Depression has lifted when we've added whole food B vitamins, fed the heart Hawthorne (an herb), eliminated sugar, added vitamin D, added red meat to the diet, or stopped soy. Usually, there is not just one cure but rather a combination of new choices that allows the body to function better. Healing with Nutrition \u2014 Real Food is Real MedicineSustainable Health This pattern is true for basically all conditions. We have stopped allergies by restoring proper organ functioning. Here are some examples of what has worked: using fenugreek (an herb), cleaning out the liver with supplements, using detox ifying footbaths, getting rid of parasites in the sinuses, stopping dairy in the diet, or eating dried radishes. We have fixed the function of the heart by clearing out arteries with whole food vitamin C, low carb diets, increasing or adding healthy fats to the diet, eliminating parasites, or supplementing iodine. Symptoms that go away include heaviness of the extremities, heartburn, fatigue, depression, high blood pressure, and swelling. There are many ways to potentially return the body to proper functioning. Knowing what to use, in the right order, for the right amount of time, is where a good doctor's expertise lies. Below are three subjects in natural healthcare that make a huge difference in how the body functions. Salt is essential to have in your diet. However, there are two kinds of salt \u2014 refined table salt and unrefined natural salt. In table salt, all the nutrients have been removed and aluminum has been added, which has been linked to imbalances and disruptions in normal body functions. Real, unrefined salt contains over 80 minerals. It is highly nutritious and has been known to lower blood pressure. It is essential to eat unrefined salt regularly. Unrefined sea salt can actually reduce blood pressure. When shopping, it's good to understand labeling. For instance, reverse osmosis and distilled water are \"de-ionized,\" which means there are no minerals left. In other words, the life has been taken out of that water. Ions, electrolytes, minerals, and unrefined salt equal life, so drink good filtered water that has minerals, and even add healthy salt if you want. Another key nutrient that helps improve and maintain health is iodine. Iodine is one of the most fascinating, intelligent, powerful, and sometimes finicky nutrients I have worked with. When your body is replete (filled up) with iodine, it blocks the poisonous elements bromine, chlorine, and fluorine. You can get iodine from ocean fish, seaweed, and iodine pills. I have seen it raise I.Q., add muscular strength, increase endurance, increase happiness, and cause weight loss. The third key subject is herbs. Herbs make your body smarter and positively affect your DNA. When you eat \"only nutrition\" \u2014 like fats, proteins, and carbohydrates \u2014 without herbs and spices, think of the nutrients as just \"sitting there.\" It has been proven that herbs direct nutrients to go to different places throughout the body, like a traffic cop. Herbs also get into our DNA to make changes. The field of study is called epigenetics. Native Americans had access to and used hundreds or thousands of herbs in the wild. We seem to only have two herbs: ketchup and catsup. Use more variety! Nutrition is a crucial part of healthy living. To decrease our reliance on the medical system, it is important to work daily at improving health. If you don't, your body will experience the consequences, and others will be happy to take charge of your future. Spend money on good food and supplements now or pay insurmountable medical expenses later. Take the smart approach and work with the body to help it heal and function at its best each day.

Ah-ha! That's why Americans are so sick, I thought.Using pills to manipulate how our body functions is the current state of disease and symptom care. Working with the body to help it heal is the smarter approach. We look for the barriers to recovery, for the breakdown in function, and then we look for the quickest path back to proper function. We are feeding bodies, and they feel better without drugs. By Dr. Darren SchmidtThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 34 Namaste, Roshani, Thank God, April showers are over! Or are they? After months of sulking from the excessive snow and rain we experienced this year , I find that my shoulders are caving forward and my heart is still feeling heavy. Even though the sunshine is uplifting, my body doesn't seem to be aligned with the positive shift in my inner emotions. What would you recommend I add into my regular routine? I look forward to hearing from you, Jocelynn C., Ann Arbor Dear Jocelynn, Are we paddling the same boat? After reading your question, it sure feels like it. Trust me, you are not alone. When your body is out of sync with your emotions, it feels like having one foot stuck knee-deep in a puddle with galoshes, with the other one free and ready to roam in flip-flops! It seems that every year, we Michiganders approach this initial change in the seasons with much trepidation \u2014 scared to get fully excited because we're so fearful the weather may take a turn for the worse. Enjoy the sunshine while it lasts! To help you with your at-home practice, here is my favorite winter-to-spring Asana: Camel Pose. Break out your short-shorts and get ready to open your heart! Placing your knees, shins, and feet on your mat, come up to a kneeling position, with knees about hip-width distance. As you inhale, lift your right arm and rotate it all the way back, so you can place your right palm on the sole of your right foot. Stay here for a few moments and exhale. Then, inhale your opposite left arm all the way back and place your left palm on the sole of your left foot. Really activate your glutes, your core, and your quadriceps. Roll your shoulder blades close together, feel your heart opening up. If your neck allows it, try dangling your head and keep your gaze backwards. Keep thrusting your pelvic area forward and stay strong in your core. Hold for just a few breaths or else you may run the risk of feeling light-headed. Rest in Child's Pose afterwards.Namaste, Roshani,I'm having a really hard time believing that the Shoulderstand is the \"Queen of all Asanas.\" I find that it hurts my neck, and I don't see the purpose of getting into a full Shoulderstand when postures like Candlestick still get my blood flowing in the opposite direction. Can you please explain to me why so many instructors include this posture as a \"must\" in their classes? Rebecca J., Saline Dear Rebecca, Inversions like the Shoulderstand can be a bit tricky at first. To begin, I suggest you try a supported Shoulderstand. Place two or three folded blankets neatly underneath your shoulder. Tuck them so that they're just at the base of the nape of your neck. This slight elevation should provide a soft cushion for your shoulder, but more importantly , offer your neck a bit of wiggle room. When in a Shoulderstand, you always want to have both your shoulders and the crown of your head pressing into the ground \u2014 never your neck. If you're practicing at home, have a friend or family member try gliding their palm through that gap between your neck and the ground. If there is no gap, that explains the pain. If your neck is making direct contact with the ground, you're not in proper form. You are correct that Candlestick is also effective in getting your blood flowing in the opposite direction, and a less complicated posture to choose. However, most yoga instructors encourage the Shoulderstand for its myriad benefits. These include calming the nervous system, easing insomnia and fatigue, and eliminating common colds and general nasal issues. My personal reason for practicing the Shoulderstand is a bit vainer. Scientific studies have proven that if you hold Shoulderstand for just three minutes a day , you can avoid varicose veins! At the end of the day , your yoga practice is a very personal matter. Should you find that even with the blankets or other props (Iyengar classes offer variations with a chair and strap), you still don't like Shoulderstand, you don't have to hop to it every practice. Find what works for you and enjoy your yoga journey every step of the way . Namaste, Roshani! Whether you're a seasoned yogi or getting ready to roll out your mat for the first time, you'll find a variety of tips from local yoga instructor, Roshani Adhikary . Namaste, Roshani, I started hot vinyasa yoga classes two weeks ago and I love them! The only thing is, while I feel energized during the classes, I feel totally depleted afterwards. What's going on? Dave B., Ypsilanti Dear Dave, Wait for it, wait for it: water! Chances are, you're not hydrating yourself enough. Heated classes can make you sweat as it is, but heated vinyasa classes involve so much movement, you're bound to need more water than ever before. Don't go for the stuff with additional flavoring \u2014 just good ol' H20.If your knees experience any discomfort, make sure you double-up on your mat to provide extra cushioning. If you're still developing flexibility and are unable to go back that far, try curling your toes and propping up your heels. You can use your fingertips to reach back to your heels. Most importantly , if you have had any low-back issues, place your palms on your sacrum with your fingers pointing toward the ground. Aim to roll your shoulder blades close together, but avoid a deep back-bend. Gaze up to the skies, but don't go all the way back with the crown of your head. Whichever variation you choose is sure to leave you feeling lighter and more open for the new season! Chances are your posture will also look and feel a bit taller.

CCCCCC CCCCCC 847.922.9693 Private Yoga & Thai Bodywork Sessions Available The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 35 Heather Glidden, age 33, is the co-owner of the recently opened Gyrotonic Tree Town & Pilates Loft Studio, located on East Washington Street in downtown Ann Arbor. A dancer since the age of 10, Heather's passion for movement and desire to become a better dancer led her to discover the Gyrotonic method, a unique system that works the entire body through fluid and rhythmic motions. Heather is also a Life Coach and Massage Therapist and incorporates elements of both to help clients reach their goals and improve their overall wellness. She has lived in Ann Arbor for 10 years with her husband and now three dogs. Bill Zirinsky: Heather, what is the derivation of the word \"Gyrotonic\"? What does it stand for, or mean?Heather Glidden: The Gyrotonic method was developed by a man named Juliu Horvath, a former dancer whose career ended as a result of several debilitating injuries. In his search for healing, he discovered the circular and wavelike movements that eventually became the Gyrotonic system. Using these movements, he was able to rejuvenate his injured body, so he called his healing movement system \"Gyrotonic\" \u2014 gyro meaning circle and tonic meaning healing. Bill Zirinsky: Is Gyrotonic a movement therapy modality, or an exercise modality, or a form of dance, or what? Heather Glidden: Juliu calls the Gyrotonic method \"The Art of Exercising and Beyond.\" It incorporates exercise, therapeutic movement, and meditation, as well as artistry and expression. Most people come to it for only one or two of those aspects at first. The system is very flexible so it can be adapted for people with a wide range of goals. For example, I've had a number of clients who have come to me initially for post-rehab therapeutic work. We did very slow, gentle work to start. As they became stronger, they transitioned into doing more challenging and fitness-oriented workouts. Some of them have also gone on to explore more of the esoteric aspects of the work, such as meditation and energetic awakening. Bill Zirinsky: I know that it is difficult to convey experiential movement and bodywork. Even so, can you try to describe to our readers what Gyrotonic is, what it consists of, and what kind of movements or exercises or stretches it encompasses? Heather Glidden: The movements are flowing, rhythmic, and playful. They look like a combination of dance, swimming, and Tai Chi. They are built around fundamental spinal motions: arch, curl, spiral, side bend, and wave. Many of them look like movements that you might see in nature, such as a cat stretching or a long blade of grass blowing in the wind. As practitioners become familiar with the Gyrotonic movements, the experience of doing a workout is like a moving meditation. In Gyrotonic sessions we use a large piece of equipment called the Gyrotonic tower. Sessions are generally either private lessons or duets (lessons with two people). The equipment is designed to support and guide the body fluidly through the exercises in a way that allows for decompression of the joints and release of tension held in the soft tissues. It may also be used to add resistance to exercises, both to stretch and strengthen the muscles. The goal of Gyrotonic movements is to create a balanced structure, allowing freedom of movement in every direction at every joint while simultaneously creating the strength to support that range of motion. There is also a version of the movement called Gyrokinesis, which one practices while seated on stools, on the floor, and standing. We generally practice Gyrokinesis in group classes. The movements are based on the same principles and look similar to the movements practiced on the Gyrotonic tower. Gyrokinesis classes follow a regular format so that over time, students can learn the format, allowing them more freedom to explore the effects of the movement in their own bodies. The rhythmic nature of the movement makes it really fun to practice in a group. As the students start to learn the movements and breath patterns, a supportive feeling develops by among the group from practicing those patterns together. My experience of Gyrokinesis classes is that they bring a deep sense of peace and joy to participants.BZ: What do you love about Gyrotonic? Heather: The aspect of Gyrotonic that I love the most is that there is always something more to learn, something deeper to explore. The system is endlessly layered so that every time I master one lesson, I discover a deeper mystery. Some of the learning comes from working with other people, but a lot of it comes from learning more about myself \u2014 about my own body, mind, and spirit. Beyond that, the movement feels great to practice, not only physically but also mentally and emotionally. I feel like I have so much more freedom in my life as a result of my Gyrotonic practice. BZ: Where were you raised, Heather? Where did you go to college? Heather: I grew up in Fort Collins, Colorado, and went to college at a small liberal arts school called Grinnell College, in Iowa. BZ: What brought you to Ann Arbor, and when? Heather: I met my husband in college, and we started dating during our senior year. He was born and raised in Ann Arbor, so after we graduated, we decided to move here. Originally, we had only planned to live here for a year \u2014 I wanted to move somewhere with warmer winters \u2014 but I sort of fell in love with it. We've been here for 10 years now, and I feel like it has been such an amazing home for us. BZ: When you were young, were you into dance and movement or gymnastics or other activities like those?Heather: I was a dancer growing up \u2014 I studied ballet, jazz, tap, modern ... anything I could get my feet on. But in my teen years, I began having severe abdominal pain that went unexplained for a long time and caused me to give up dance. BZ: Could you have predicted as a teenager that you might end up doing work in a field like Gyrotonic?Heather: Due to my abdominal pain, I didn't foresee myself in any field that involved movement. Looking back now, I can see how my experience with debilitating pain, combined with my love of movement, offered me the perfect preparation for the work that I do now. BZ: Tell us about your path to Pilates. I know you started with Pilates at a very young age.An Interview with Heather Glidden on the Gyrotonic\u00ae Method The movements are flowing, rhythmic, and playful. They look like a combination of dance, swimming, and Tai Chi. They are built around fundamental spinal motions: arch, curl, spiral, side bend, and wave. Continued on page 36I was a dancer growing up \u2014 I studied ballet, jazz, tap, modern ... anything I could get my feet on. The intention of the Gyrotonic system is to move and stimulate every part and system of the body (muscular, skeletal, nervous, energetic, and so on) so that the whole organism can have a greater expression of life. In essence, the goal is to be more alive. Photo by Trista SuttonThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 36 Heather: My favorite dance teacher got me hooked on Pilates when I was about ten. She told me that practicing Pilates would make me a better dancer. At that age I would do pretty much anything to be a better dancer \u2014 from taking French to playing a musical instrument \u2014 so when she promised that Pilates would make me a better dancer, I did it. BZ: You told me that you didn't get the \"feeling\" from Pilates that you saw other people getting, and that you wanted that feeling. Can you say more about that?Heather: Taking Pilates as a young dancer, I didn't really understand the intention of the movement at that point. I was just doing what my teacher told me to do, but I did notice that after class my fellow dancers talked about feeling great \u2014 \"longer,\" \"lighter,\" like they were \"walking on air.\" They didn't just say it; I could see it in their faces. They felt better after class. I didn't get that feeling from Pilates, but it looked great so I wanted to experience it. The first time I walked out of a Gyrokinesis class, I thought, Ah, that's the feeling I was looking for! The class felt like getting a moving massage and afterwards I was left with a lovely feeling of freedom and expansiveness in my body. That's how I got hooked on the Gyrotonic system. BZ: And then how did Pilates take you to Gyrotonic? Tell us about your path to your current career.After I graduated from college with a dance degree, I really didn't know what to do with myself. I started doing a Pilates teacher training program thinking that maybe I could make a little extra income in the evenings. As I trained, I realized that people teach Pilates full-time, so that became my goal. At that time, I kept hearing about Gyrotonic and seeing the equipment in the center where I did my Pilates training. I read articles about it, and it looked fascinating. That was what led me to try out my first Gyrokinesis class. By the end of that class, I knew I wanted to do the Gyrokinesis teacher training. At first I taught both Pilates and Gyrotonic, but my passion has always been more with the Gyrotonic work, and I eased away from teaching Pilates as soon as I had built up enough Gyrotonic clients to sustain me. BZ: \"Movement as an expression of life,\" is an expression you used in describing Gyrotonic to me. Can you elaborate?Heather: Movement is a fundamental sign that we are alive \u2014 movement of breath, the pumping of the heart to circulate blood. Thus when an area of the body becomes blocked and is unable to move, it is stagnant, less alive. The intention of the Gyrotonic system is to move and stimulate every part and system of the body (muscular, skeletal, nervous, energetic, and so on) so that the whole organism can have a greater expression of life. In essence, the goal is to be more alive. BZ: What is the process for certification as a Gyrotonic instructor? Heather: Gyrotonic certification involves four courses and an apprenticeship totaling about 200 hours of study. The process generally takes about a year to complete. Gyrokinesis certification requires a similar but separate process. After completing certification, most Gyrotonic instructors go on to study more specialized topics to deepen their knowledge. I generally take about 150 to 200 hours per year of continuing education courses to deepen my understanding of the work. BZ: And approximately how many Gyrotonic instructors are there around the country?Heather: I'm not sure how many there are in the U.S. There are about 4,000 instructors currently active worldwide. BZ: You went to massage school, too, correct? And how do you incorporate that into your work?Heather: Yes, I completed the program at the Ann Arbor Institute for Massage Therapy in 2010. Much of the work that I do with clients is therapeutic in nature, and my massage training gives me another tool to help get my clients moving. If someone comes in with a sore neck or tweaked back, I might put them on the massage table before we start moving so that they'll feel better right away when they do start moving. Or if they've had chronic restriction in an area that isn't releasing with movement, then I might use some massage techniques to help free up tension. BZ: Do you still bring Pilates into your work? Heather: Yes, I do occasionally. I try to approach each client with fresh eyes every day, and sometimes Pilates exercises are a better match for where a client is at on a given day than Gyrotonic exercises. BZ: You've recently opened a new studio. Tell us about what you're intending for it. And who have you gone into partnership with? What kinds of individual sessions, classes, and workshops will your new studio be offering? Heather Glidden on the Gyrotonic\u00ae Method Continued from page 35 As practitioners become familiar with the Gyrotonic movements, the experience of doing a workout is like a moving meditation.Photo by Joni Strickfaden Photo by Joni Strickfaden The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 37 Heather: My former studio, Willow Wellness Studio, has recently evolved into a new one. I've moved to a gorgeous loft space on the third floor of the Blue Tractor Brewery building in downtown Ann Arbor and combined studios with Tamara Aprea at Pilates Loft to form one big new studio called \"Gyrotonic Tree Town & Pilates Loft Studio.\" I am really excited for this new chapter in my studio's life both because of our gorgeous new space and because it gives me an opportunity to work with a lot of great people. I'm also excited to have a partner with whom to share the job of running the studio. I enjoy creating a studio space, but it is a lot of work, and sometimes it's hard to balance management with teaching. I'm looking forward to having a partner so we can share the job of management and continue to grow the studio together. To me, working in partnership is an important symbolic step that I hope to see reflected more often in the larger world. So this is one way I can cultivate that value with my business. Our new studio has a total of nine instructors and offers individual and group Pilates and Gyrotonic classes as well as yoga. We have a massage therapist offering services out of our space as well. We also offer Gyrotonic and Pilates teacher training courses. Beyond that, we are currently developing weekend workshops organized around specific topics pertaining to fitness and well-being. BZ: What do you like least about your work? Heather: The administrative aspects of my job \u2014 emailing, organizing schedules, and making phone calls \u2014 are the parts that I would love to wave a magic wand and make disappear. BZ: You are a Life Coach, as well? How does that help you in your work? Yes, I am. As with massage and Pilates, I generally don't offer isolated coaching sessions. Instead I use it as another tool in my Gyrotonic teaching. I don't use every tool in every session, but sometimes one seems more appropriate than another. For example, if I have a client who comes in with a lot of neck and shoulder tension, we might start out with Gyrotonic movements that release the neck and shoulders while strengthening the spine to offer more support to that area. If that isn't effective, then I might try using some massage techniques to release the tension. If, after several sessions, the client finds that the tension continues to return, then I might use coaching inquiry techniques to help the client explore what aspects of her life might be causing the tension and how she might be able to shift those situations. BZ: Tell us about your spectrum of patients. Heather: My clients come from a wide variety of backgrounds \u2014 I have worked with people from ages 7 to 87, from those needing therapeutic work to professional-level athletes and dancers. I really enjoy working with high performers who come in many stripes. My definition of \"high performer\" is anyone who is dedicated enough to show up to their lesson fully present and ready to really see where they can go every week. They are people who don't set limits for themselves. Professional dancers and athletes fall into this category, but I have also found that a lot of people who are facing chronic pain or injury are a part of this group \u2014 it takes tremendous courage to continue engaging with your body when it hurts all the time. A lot of my clients came to me originally because they were trying to avoid having surgery, they were rehabbing after surgery, or they just wanted to be able to exercise but hadn't been able to without injury. The most gratifying part of my work is seeing people who were once afraid of moving discover that they can have freedom and joy in it again. I am also a Gyrotonic and Gyrokinesis pre-trainer, which means that I can conduct the first part of the teacher training. I am excited to be able to share this method that I am passionate about with new practitioners. BZ: Is your work used as an adjunct to physical therapy or chiropractic or osteopathy or surgery, or other healing and medical modalities?Heather: Absolutely. My work is not a replacement for any of these modalities, but it works well alongside them, and I have collaborated with a number of other medical professionals, both traditional and alternative, to help my clients realize their wellness goals. BZ: Please share with us a few anecdotes about situations in which Gyrotonic has really made a difference to a client or patient of yours.I have one client who is a dancer who had a foot injury that makes it difficult for her to even walk now. The Gyrokinesis movements that we do on the stool and on the floor give her the feeling of dancing without putting weight on her feet. She is a beautiful mover, and it always makes me so happy to see that she is still able to dance in this way. The first time I walked out of a Gyrokinesis class, I thought, Ah, that's the feeling I was looking for! The class felt like getting a moving massage, and afterwards, I was left with a lovely feeling of freedom and expansiveness in my body . GYROTONIC\u00ae Tree Town & Pilates Loft Studio gyrotonictreetown.com I have another client who came in with severe tightness in his hips. His initial goals were to be able to put his own socks on and to sit on a horse again. He worked really hard and not only accomplished those goals within just a few months, but also reached the point where he could do a trail ride on a horse. Our big goal this summer has been to improve his golf game, and he has been coming in every week reporting better scores, so I think we're making good progress. Most of my clients, though, are more like my professor client who came in with severe back pain and weakness. In that case, the progress is slow and steady and can be tracked over the years that she has been taking lessons. When she first started, she had trouble lifting her children and going up and down stairs without experiencing a major flare-up of back pain. Now she can travel with her children, lifting luggage and sitting in awkward airplane seats, without any significant flare-up. This isn't an overnight improvement, but the difference between now and when she started is dramatic and has had a big impact on her quality of life. BZ: Anything else you'd like to be sure to tell us about? Heather: Oh, I think I'm already over on my word count, so we'll leave it with this.BZ: Thanks, Heather. Heather: Thank you!The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 38 We are all at a tipping point. We are grappling with how to be ourselves, how to find meaning and happiness in our lives, and how to find balance in a very complex world. We meditate, practice yoga, eat healthy, and search for alternative healing methods and for our spirit's true nature. We often encounter crossroads where we must make difficult decisions, take new directions, or consider uncomfortable choices. Yet when it comes to legal matters \u2014 like setting up a business, getting a divorce, or seeking advice about what legal rights we have \u2014 do we need to resort to \"traditional\" legal solutions, or are others available? Is it possible to have a more comprehensive and positive approach to solving legal issues that benefits us in mind, body, and spirit? The answer is yes; we have the ability to guide our lives in a way that is exactly right for us. As a lawyer, I have realized that we need to shift the mindset from the old realities into a more natural and spiritual way of relating to the nature of law and people. The old worldview of how things have always been done doesn't work. Many have declared the legal system \"broken,\" citing the time, money, effort, and unforeseen emotional costs of traditional litigation. Moreover, the general experience of litigants has been negative as they exit the process often worse off than when they entered it. Lawyers too are unhappy with the way the system functions; industry studies show widespread job dissatisfaction and stress-related health problems. Like many other practitioners and businesses, some lawyers are starting to explore applying holistic approaches to the practice of law by looking at legal solutions with a different lens, changing the discourse, and transforming the practice of law from an adversarial practice to a more preventive and collaborative one. The holistic approach focuses on the whole person and the whole problem in order to find more healthy and sustainable legal solutions. I have been a lawyer for over two decades. I started my legal career as a civil rights attorney. I grew up Puerto Rican, the daughter of two deaf parents, and poor. I was no stranger to discrimination and struggle, and I believed that change could only happen by fighting in an adversarial way. Initially, I became a lawyer to battle inequality and the draconian and adversarial notions of law. However, early in my career, the legal training I received seemed to be at odds with and antithetical to the person I was and am, and I couldn't find a balance. As lawyers we are trained in a retributive philosophical way. The law is viewed as hierarchical, adversarial, and punitive, and it is guided by codified laws and written rules and procedures. Its power is vertical, and decision-making is left to a few. We are taught that we can rationalize any position or state of affairs no matter how outrageous, indecent, or unjust, and that we should suppress our emotions and personal experiences as we assimilate into the legal profession. Yet this very notion robs lawyers and our clients of our diverse identities. It forces us to compartmentalize our clients' problems, overlook their inner experiences, and respond primarily to the external facts of their \"legal\" situations. It contributes to missed opportunities to settle cases and leads to contracts that do not reflect the real intention of the parties. Recognizing Opportunity in Conflict Early in my legal career, I represented a gay minister who had just come out to his parish after 16 years of ministering and was subsequently fired. From my perspective as a civil rights lawyer, it was a great trial case of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation (a protected class in the state I was practicing). I was elated to try this case and set precedent. What the client wanted was not a trial or a large settlement but a holistic healing ceremony with his parish, an apology, and the ability to move forward with respect and dignity. I learned that for him it was about community. He wanted to resolve the conflict in a manner that was good for everyone and not simply focused on the win. That day, I realized that being a good lawyer is about being a healer, peacemaker, and problem solver. I realized that law could be practiced differently and that this true change would bring a new vision. The new vision involved finding a way to humanize the law through a holistic, solution-based approach. Not coincidentally, I went back and explored my Ta\u00edno Indian (native Puerto Rican) roots. Similar to many Native American practices, I was drawn to the model of an indigenous circle of justice that seeks to connect on a continuum everyone involved with a problem and makes paramount healing and reintegrating individuals into the community. The center of the circle represents the entire process \u2014 from disclosure to problems, solutions, making amends, and restoring relationships \u2014 by using methods and principles of healing and living in harmony with nature and those around us. This view shows us that there is a deep connection between justice and spirituality and that harmony and balance are essential to this path. Holistic Law Holistic law practitioners see conflicts as opportunities for growth. We often look inward to become whole ourselves in order to best assist our clients in using the legal process to find wholeness. Holistic law is \"big picture\" thinking or consideration and analysis of circumstances beyond the obvious issue. It looks at the lawyer's role, the client's role in the problem and solution, and the impact of the problem and solution on the community. Instead of starting with what happened, it focuses on what is happening now. It emphasizes the difference between thought and mindfulness. In mindfulness, we realize that we are all part of something far beyond our individual life situations. By tapping into this broader reality, we develop true understanding and compassion for others, even those we had previously \"blamed\" for our current legal situations. It is about looking at legal solutions with a different lens. Not every legal problem is the same. Not every client is the same. As a lawyer, \"If the hammer is your only tool in your box, then every problem begins to look like a nail.\" We are seeing a paradigm shift in the framework of our beliefs, in what the legal profession should be and what the role of the law should be, and in the tools we have in our box.By Angie Martell Photos by Deborah Marcero As a lawyer, I have realized that we need to shift the mindset from the old realities into a more natural and spiritual way of relating to the nature of law and people. I grew up Puerto Rican, the daughter of two deaf parents, and poor. I was no stranger to discrimination and struggle, and I believed that change could only happen by fighting in an adversarial way. Practicing from the Heart: Lawyers as Peacemakers, Problem Solvers, and Healers of Conflict The holistic approach focuses on the whole person and the whole problem in order to find more healthy and sustainable legal solutions.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 39 The umbrella of holistic law is broad and multifaceted. It can encompass various tenets \u2014 the power of forgiveness, mindfulness, civility, thought and conflict resolution, and transformative and therapeutic jurisprudence. It calls for lawyers to listen intentionally and deeply in order to gain a complete understanding of a client's issues; to acknowledge the opportunity in conflict; to honor and respect the dignity and integrity of each individual; to encourage compassion, reconciliation, healing, forgiveness, and letting go, and, most important, to enjoy the practice of law. In my practice, I may consult or involve other professionals (non-legal for the most part) who can help my clients navigate the emotional or financial issues they face, either during the case or after the case, so that they can bring their best self to the process. Often times it is the additional outside factors that can impact a legal case. Clients may need support from professionals such as life coaches, therapists, bodywork and energy healers, mediators, financial specialists, and child specialists. Since compassion is also the cornerstone of this practice, it's about encouraging clients to see that all legal challenges are intimately connected with fundamental issues about the meaning of life and that specific problems are invariably dealt with better from a broader perspective. Holistic Law in Practice In the area of family law and divorce, a holistic approach entails looking at issues with an eye to the future and finding common ground with parties. Just because couples are divorcing does not mean that the family ends. We engage in a dialogue about letting go of blame and identifying what they need, rather than what they think they may want. We often find support from other professions. In Michigan, a party can obtain a divorce without the consent of the other as long as he or she meets the residency and domicile requirements and there is no pregnancy. For many clients this is difficult because within six months that individual more than likely will be divorced. It may be hard for him or her to deal with the range of emotions (disappointment, anger, hurt, betrayal, sadness, fear, and loss) he or she may feel. Studies have shown that how a couple conducts themselves during divorce has a far greater impact on the children than the act of divorcing itself. Preparing for a divorce can be confusing and frightening. It's like moving to a strange country where you don't speak the language, don't understand the customs, and the conditions are harsh. Generally, in a traditional divorce, two lawyers hash it out in a court of law. Parties have very little direct contact with each other, and what little interactions they do have are bitter or unproductive. In a holistic approach, the parties can come together either in a collaborative process or participate in a traditional process with an early mediation. They can discuss how to protect their rights and move forward without fighting fire with fire or unnecessary acrimony. I find that most parties don't want a nasty divorce but just aren't sure how to work out issues or communicate with each other. I had a client who still loved her husband of over 20 years and wasn't ready to let go. She didn't understand why he wanted the divorce. She did not want the divorce and felt he wasn't very communicative with her. She had adult children with him and was in her fifties. Both parties acknowledged that they would probably be in each other's lives because they were awaiting the birth of their first grandchild. They didn't know how to move forward. He felt guilt, and she felt anger and depression. When he finally admitted why he wanted the divorce \u2014 another woman \u2014 she fell apart and had a hard time participating in the divorce process. She needed support and, in a holistic practice, she got it. She started going to yoga and meditation classes, received help with health insurance coverage, and went to support groups. Six months later she was in a better place emotionally and felt prepared to accept the Judgment of Divorce. In criminal law, it can mean working compassionately with clients, especially indigent clients, and being aware that the problems and challenges they face stretch further than the confines of the case before them. It can mean providing them with assistance, or, in a restorative justice approach, it could be a process that supports the community healing from the crime, and rather than punishment, the healing of the victims, community, and even the offender. Its processes seek to reconnect people as human beings through a web of connections that offers support and accountability. In business law, it's about creating holistic business strategies that allow business owners to develop entirely new mindsets and beliefs about their companies and their roles within them. The new strategies empower them to more fully understand the ins/outs of the product/service offering so that they can focus on serving their markets instead of the stock market and reconnect company success with social progress. Creating the Change and Being the Change In all areas of law, a revolution is currently underway that is being generated by both clients and attorneys to change the nature of how the law is used and how it operates. More and more people want control over their lives and want to find solutions that are more journey-orientated rather than destination-based. They are planting the seeds with the belief that problems can and should be resolved not with confrontation and game-playing, but with care, awareness, and collaboration. I believe that in order to change how we practice law, we have to adopt a different mindset \u2014 not just thinking outside the box but ultimately getting rid of the box. It's about learning to be a peacekeeper, not an adversary. The nominal winner is often the real loser \u2014 in fees, expenses, and time. \"Lawyers as peacekeepers\" means being part of a process and approach that can make a positive difference in the lives of clients and measuring our own lives not by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away. I am an optimist who believes that we have the ability to change how we practice law. All we need to do is start. In starting, so must the law change. I believe positive change is on the horizon, and since law is the foundation of societal structures, then transforming the law could indeed transform the world.

She answers questions about the retreat and what it's like practicing yoga in a foreign country. Interviewed by Julianne Popovec Q. How did the Soglio retreat come about? A. In the heart of Switzerland's mountainous Bregaglia district lies Soglio, a small farming village built by my husband Rupert's ancestors, more than 1,000 years ago. For Rupert, sharing Soglio with me was a dream come true. For me, in turn, sharing Soglio with yoga students is a dream come true. My first thought after entering its majestic field was: Somehow, someday, I will share this place with beloved yoga students. I am convinced that we should not question the birthing of such an idea. Instead, its call to action orchestrates life, magically. Listening and honoring \u2014 with reverence \u2014 is at the core of yoga and offers life pathways and purpose. My initial glimpse into Soglio was a silhouette against the majestic backdrop of Alpine mountain peaks piercing a deep blue sky. Its energetic vibrancy gave me goose bumps. I was in awe \u2014 thus the name Be In Awe \u2014 and keenly aware of my bursting resolve: I will bring yoga students to Soglio one day. Rupert's response, \"You couldn't possibly do that,\" provided me with an inner, Hmmmmm... give me two years.So it happened. Yoga students, mostly from Ann Arbor, gathered in 2004 for our first welcome dinner. And, due to popular demand, we have served the same welcome menu for each of the eight years (you'll have to join us to find out what it is). Q. What is it like, practicing yoga in Soglio? A. Sometimes we've chosen to use the yoga meditation studio, a converted hayloft in the village center. But mostly, yoga mats are arranged in a field, where we meditate and stretch, breathing in life, deepening a connection with the earth and to the sun while magnifying and resting in Soglio's shimmering beauty. Morning practices prepare us for late morning hikes that take us through resonant tunnels carved through the rock, fun for singing, chanting, and improvisation, to waterfall-fed swimming holes, which are wonderful for refreshing dips. We sometimes hike to Italian market villages with their handmade, take-home treasures, ancient ruins, lovely little meadows with breathtaking views, local grottos, gelateria, caf\u00e9s, and Roman roads used until the 1800s for herding sheep, goats, and cows. Evening practices shake out any lingering tightness from the day's hike-swim-sing, with time for the sharing of insights, adventures and transformations \u2014 in preparation for a good night's sleep. During our fifth yoga retreat (2009), local farmer Felix Bruegger, in addressing our group, offered a brilliant explanation for Soglio's unmistakable field of radiance: \"We farmers have always used organic methods and ancient farming rotation techniques (using our hands versus machinery), while embracing and prioritizing this philosophy of looking after each other and the animals with kindness.\" This e ver-present attitude of kindness permeates the village. It explains Soglio's exceptional goat cheese, scrumptious raw milk, and a line of gorgeous strictly pure Soglio products made exclusively from local plants and herbs. One more element that enhances our yoga practice is Soglio's light. The unique and exquisite lighting results from the way in which the sun enters and exits the village each day \u2014 truly something to behold. Soglio is frequented by artists and photographers from around the globe who come for the light. Q. Ho w have the retreats evolved over the years? A. The first couple of years, most attendees were Be In Awe yoga students from Ann Arbor. By year three, we were also welcoming yogis from Germany, Holland, England, Belgium, and India. Some travel solo, some with a partner, daughter or friend, and some have traveled in a group. Some have time enough just for the retreat. Others tag on a week for exploring Milan, Lake Como, St. Moritz, or Zurich. All talk about the \"gotta get myself there\" call, coupled with having had to muster up courage, at least for the first year. Each year, we have around half the group who have returned for a second or third time. They really welcome, look after, and generate loads of excitement for first time attendees. Each has a story to share from a previous year, such as a hike, class, meditation, meal, and so on. This builds year after year and is really so rewarding to observe. Q. Where do you stay? A. We've mostly stayed in a gorgeous old house that is over 700 years old. Typically Swiss in how it's masterfully equipped and brilliantly restored, with beautiful and varied views, the house is comfortable and indicative of the region \u2014 with the kitchen and adjoining balcony wonderful for gathering. Some participants specify single rooms. But, on their next year return, each (without exception) has preferred sharing a room, from which many (and there are many) \"roaring with laughter\" moments and many tearful moments have ensued \u2014 all essential in finding one's way home and sharing that home inside friendship. Conscious Travel Yoga and Cultural Connection in the Swiss AlpsJody Tull, owner of Ann Arbor's Be in Awe Yoga ...

My first thought after entering Soglio's majestic field was: Somehow , someday, I will share this place with beloved yoga students. Morning practices prepare us for late morning hikes that take us through resonant tunnels carved through the rock, fun for singing, chanting, and improvisation...The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 41 Q. What do you appreciate about the culture? A. The pace of daily life for the locals unfolds with connection to the sunrise and sunset. They work hard and then, bas ta, they call it a day. Stone benches provide gathering places for sharing news of the day, while admiring the changing tones of bright orange against the darkening blue sky. To drink the fresh unpasteurized milk, to catch a morning whiff of baking bread and then partake while it is still warm and slathered with freshly churned butter, to savor the taste and texture of the day's collection of eggs and to fill up on the world's best- ever fresh goat cheese \u2014 all of this epitomizes the very heart of \"buying local.\" Year-round residents, whose clans have lived in Soglio for hundreds of years, radiate the beauty of their surroundings. Machines, internet connections, and other ways of modern life are relegated to second place. Instead, the people of Soglio connect with and tune in to nature, the angle of the sun, the current season. They listen to Mother Earth. Q. How can yoga enhance your connection to a place and culture in a way that might be different than if you just traveled to the location, not on a yoga retreat? A. Yoga enhances the senses, so you are much more aware of the sights and sounds and smells and textures around you. The experience of sitting down to meditate in a pre-dawn dark meadow, and opening your eyes to a fresh new sunrise, is bliss absolute. The values of organic farming, fresh air, mountain views, and the outdoor life are perfectly matched to the health generating practice of yoga. It's completely enriching to arrive in a new location with a purpose, rather than just as an observer. The yoga element means that you are surrounded by like-minded people; many deep friendships have been forged among Soglio participants. The local way of life is diametrically opposite to the frenzied, smart-phone driven rat race found in so much of the world. The people of Soglio enjoy life for itself. Q. What are some cultural differences you've observed? A. Soglio is at the meeting point of two cultures \u2014 Swiss and Italian. The Swiss are reserved, thoughtful, and meticulous. They are not afraid to invest time and money to do something the right and wise way, so it will serve generations to come. They appreciate healthy hard work, nourishing food, activity, and relaxation. The Italians are exuberant, full of color, creativity, and fun. They come to life in the evening. The Swiss have finished their day's work before some Italians rise from their beds. Both regions have natural beauty and stunning architecture, in different ways. One of many joys in Soglio is experiencing the influence of both cultures. The Italian border is only an hour's walk from Soglio. Q. What is the food like? A. Alan Harmer and Rupert de Salis are chefs extraordinaire and receive rave reviews. The meals are always fresh and vegetarian, using mostly local ingredients with exquisite presentation, and Italian and Indian influences. Each year Alan brings fresh herbs from his garden in Geneva, along with his homemade quince jam and top secret ingredients for his best ever homemade ice-cream. Q. What do you hope your guests discover on these retreats? A. Awe. Gratitude. Best of life friendship \u2014 most especially with oneself. A relaxing energized flow to the day. A deeper and gentler understanding of the intention of yoga as a listening practice that reveals inner stirrings and wisdom. To discover and experience a way of life that prioritizes non-violence, gentleness, and kindness \u2014 especially directed toward oneself. Noticing and remembering just how good it feels to be comfortably at home, inside one's own self and sharing that ease with others. Q. What effects does practicing yoga in a foreign location have on travelers mentally, spiritually, and physically? A. Travel is stimulating. It takes you away from the concerns of daily life. It heightens your awareness of everything, especially that which is new and different. A change of climate, food, and daily routines, and being surrounded by wonderful, like-minded people does wonders for your mood and outlook on life. Soglio, in particular, has a special magic. I wish I could just whisk people there, to experience the extraordinary sunlight, views, smells, sounds and textures \u2014 like the sound of water splashing into fountains as you fall asleep. What a backdrop for practicing yoga and meditation! Q. Have you faced any challenges in leading a retreat abroad? A. Yes! The main challenge is to convey to people who haven't yet joined us just how transforming it is to practice yoga in Soglio. Early on, my students suggested that my raves about Soglio were me just being \"all enthusiastic.\" But, after experiencing Soglio first hand, they come home and recruit their colleagues, friends, and relatives. Most people who have joined us in Soglio have come because of a referral. Q. How have things changed from the first Soglio retreat to the latest one? A. Each year we discover a new gem of a hike, picnic meadow, or singing tunnel. Our list is now so long that choosing the walks, meadows, and menus for that year can be a fun kind of challenge. Q. Jody, how long have you been practicing yoga? A. I happened into the Sivandanda Yoga Center in the mid-1980s while working toward my master's degree in Music Education at Columbia University. The swami in charge of the yoga center offered me unlimited yoga classes in exchange for voice lessons. This lovely opportunity was the launch of my yoga practice and the beginning of the popular course I teach called \"Finding Your Voice.\" These workshops are powerfully transformational, guiding students into experiencing the healing capacity of music with the healing capacity of yoga. Q. What made you want to become a teacher ? A. I fell in love with how alive, open, and energized yoga made me feel. I wanted to share the experience of that feeling with all my loved ones. More than anything, I hope to be a force for good and provide a place of calm in our frantic world. My yoga practice \u2014 ultimately a meditation practice \u2014 puts me in touch with, and reveals to me, my best self. Inside the energy field of Soglio, yoga participants effortlessly connect with the source of their breath and the great outdoors. Facilitating that connection in others is extremely rewarding. If, as it was intended by ancient sages, every world citizen engaged in a daily meditative yoga-like practice, we would, more and more, resonate a peaceful and beautiful \u2014 Soglio-like \u2014 world. Jody Tull received her master's degree in education from Columbia University and lives in Ann Arbor. She is a certified therapeutic yoga instructor with 18 years of teaching experience. Her work combines classical full spectrum yoga, the philosophy of yoga, meditative hatha yoga, and the yoga of sound, called \"Finding Your Voice.\" Weekly yoga classes and relaxation treatments are held at the Be In Awe Yoga Studio in Ann Arbor.

Today the Ann Arbor company is widely lauded for its environmental consciousness and its meticulous planning. National Geographic's Adventure magazine ranked JOURNEYS International among the best adventure travel companies on earth and set JOURNEYS on its list of top ten tour operators. The list was whittled down from hundreds of travel operations, and included among the judges' criteria were: educational components, sustainability, and quality of service. National Geographic's Traveler magazine listed JOURNEYS trips to Burma and Ladakh as \"tours of a lifetime.\" Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler awarded JOURNEYS the \"Top Travel Specialist\" designation for eight consecutive years, and awarded it the Best Green Travel Outfitter honor. JOURNEYS now offers more than 175 trips to 57 destinations around the globe. JOURNEYS is the oldest family-owned global eco-tourism company in the U.S. It offers safaris, treks, eco-tours, and cultural exploration on every continent, including Antarctica. In the early years of the company, the Webers established the Earth Preservation Fund (EPF), a non-profit that helps fund initiatives generated by local staffs in various countries. EPF supports sustainable agriculture and promotes other green projects. JOURNEYS has attracted a loyal clientele. At the recent JOURNEYS Jamboree, a weekend-long celebration of the company's 35 th anniversary, JOURNEYS travelers, along with many international guides, gathered in Ann Arbor from around the world. Travel alumni wore badges that included the number of trips they had taken with JOURNEYS. One couple's badges bore the number 49. The weekend was like a family reunion. Even outsiders who attended events open to the public felt embraced by the family feeling. Those public events were a storytelling evening at the Michigan Theater and an afternoon \"Travel Forum,\" which featured a keynote address by Will Weber and an assortment of sessions with staff and international partners. The Webers were pioneers in the environmental movement. They met at Earth Day's inaugural event, in 1970, in Madison, Wisconsin. Will had just completed his undergraduate work there and was among the event's organizers. Joan was a volunteer. She had just arrived from Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts to spend a semester at Wisconsin. After attending a meeting that Will ran, she was smitten. Soon after, he joined the Peace Corps, and taught math and science in Nepal for two years. Joan completed her bachelor's at Mt. Holyoke, earned a master's in education at the University of Pennsylvania, and taught school in Boston. But the die was cast. In 1974, she visited him in Nepal. He had extended his stay with the Peace Corps and was developing programs for Nepal's nascent National Parks Service. He also helped train the Peace Corps group assigned to work in the Conservation Office. Joan stayed and taught English for six months. The following year, they married. They arrived in Ann Arbor soon after, as doctoral students at the University of Michigan. Will was in natural resources, Joan in psychology and education. While in graduate school, they shared stories and photos of Nepal with friends. In 1978, these friends decided to visit Nepal themselves. Will and Joan looked at their friends' itinerary and said: \"Just buy us tickets, and we'll show you Nepal. It will cost you less.\" Their friends agreed, and the rest is history. By the time Will completed his doctorate, in 1980, JOURNEYS was his full-time work. For their inaugural tour as leaders, they wrote ahead for a sirdar, a head guide, the one who would be in charge of the trek's logistics. Upon arrival in Kathmandu, they found a note saying: \"Sorry, I wasn't able to get you a staff person.\" Will and Joan quickly sized up the situation. He went off to find a guide, while Joan took the group, on rented bikes, on a tour through Kathmandu. Will headed for the shopping area, the most likely place to find a guide. People go there to buy climbing and camping gear. He found a crowd in rapt attention, listening to a man who had just returned from a dire climbing expedition. The man, a born storyteller, had been a sherpa for that expedition, and he described a night from hell. When the weather turned bad, he and a fellow sherpa hacked a bivouac for their clients, then pitched a tent for themselves. During the night, when the storyteller went outside to pee, Joan and Will Weber's JOURNEYS International: Exploring the World, Expanding the Soul When Joan and Will Weber founded JOURNEYS International 35 years ago, the term \"eco-tourism\" did not exist.JOURNEYS is the oldest family-owned global eco- tourism company in the U.S. It offers safaris, treks, eco-tours, and cultural exploration on every continent, including Antarctica.

It swept him and his friend down the mountainside. They lost their shoes, but they kept their heads and survived. The close call, he said, had changed his calling. He would no longer work as a climbing sherpa. He would work in trekking. Will approached the man, and asked him to be the group's sirdar. The man, Pemba Tsering Sherpa, agreed. Will and Pemba hired two rickshaws, bought all the requisite supplies, and returned to Joan. The group set out the following day. They spent almost four weeks in the mountains of Chitwan National Park, during which Pemba served as cook, too. Every night they told stories. A friendship was forged. It grew stronger with time. Joan and Will learned that Pemba had been raised by a single mother who died when he was seven. They were out one day, collecting firewood on the mountainside, when she fell to her death before his eyes. Pemba's father, a trader, had died before Pemba was born. Pemba's siblings were considerably older than he was. They sent him to live with relatives who treated him as a servant. At age 12, he ran away. He was smart, quick, and ambitious. He began working as a sherpa for European and Japanese expeditions. He quickly picked up several languages, including Japanese. He was sent to Japan to learn cooking. The Webers were increasingly impressed with Pemba, and this trip helped consolidate their own plans for the future. \"Meeting Pemba,\" said Joan, \"is JOURNEYS' creation story.\" For Pemba, meeting the Webers was a milestone in making his dreams come true. With their help, he set up the Kathmandu branch of JOURNEYS International. Over the years, the Weber and Sherpa families became more than friends; they were family. Their relationship speaks to the spiritual and personal journeys that are part and parcel of every JOURNEYS' tour.

My first visit to JOURNEYS' spacious suite of offices took me to the west side of town, off Jackson Road, near the string of car dealerships. Joan greeted me at the door and took me on a leisurely tour of the airy labyrinthine space, dotted throughout with travel artifacts. The walls are adorned with colorful photos, many oversize, and filled with faces I would soon recognize through Joan's stories. Joan's combination of warmth and focus was impressive. A woman of natural grace and charm, she introduced me to each member of JOURNEYS' Ann Arbor staff, who stood, smiled, and shook my hand. The many shelves, some in free-standing cases dividing office spaces, held dolls, weavings, baskets, pottery, sculptures large and small, and framed mementos. Years of JOURNEYS' history come alive in these relics. I paused often to gaze at photos of native peoples in their colorful costumes. Often, members of the blond, blue-eyed Weber family gazed back at me from among the tableaux. After the tour, Joan relaxed with me, as though she had all the time in the world. Each time I met her, she wrapped herself in soft, woven scarves, evocations of her travels. Her stories, spontaneous and generous, were carefully selected and meticulously told. I soon appreciated that behind this smiling, gracious figure was a skilled academic. On my second visit to JOURNEYS' headquarters, I met with Will, Joan, and their daughter, Robin, 31. In 2011, Robin earned her M.B.A. and announced that she wanted to return to Ann Arbor to work in the family business. Her parents were thrilled. She had been away from Ann Arbor for 12 years. During graduate school in DC, she worked part time for JOURNEYS. After graduation, she returned with her husband to Ann Arbor, where she has been easing her way into her new role as president of the company. Her parents, meanwhile, are \"coasting into retirement,\" as Joan put it. It was a treat to sit with this trio and experience the easy give and take that is a hallmark of the Weber family. Robin, who was, essentially, born into this family business, has traveled with her parents from age four. She has many fond memories of their journeys. She remembers a restaurant in Burma, where she announced to her parents: \"I'm done with eating!\" That was when she was fed up with unfamiliar grub and yearned for tastes of home. Remembering the days of traveling with their children, Will said: \"Somehow we'd find a jar of peanut butter and Ritz crackers.\" An Earth Day Message from Joan and Will Weber Every year, Joan and Will send out an Earth Day message. This one is from 2013. Earth Day is special to us as founders of JOURNEYS. We met during preparations for the first Earth Day in the spring of 1970 in Madison, Wisconsin. Will was one of the campus organizers and Joan was a volunteer. Earth Day was an expression of our desire to help the planet, but we didn't know then exactly what form our eventual contribution would take. After college we engaged the world through travel, Peace Corps, and grad school. We married and later led the first JOURNEYS trip to Nepal in 1978. Back then, the norm for Himalayan travel was the grand expedition with foreign leaders and imported comforts. When we decided to do things differently \u2014 to travel in a small group with local guides, to buy all supplies locally, to contribute to conservation efforts \u2014 we were inventing an \"eco\" tour, although the term didn't yet exist. It made so much sense to us. We decided to repeat our efforts elsewhere in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. We were gratified that others in the travel industry came to see things the same way. Eco-tourism as a movement and strategy has been one of the environmental victories of the past four decades. From the Himalayas to the Andes, from the Amazon jungle to the rain forests of Africa, communities have found ways to sustain themselves by preserving rather than consuming their resources. It's a win-win-win for travelers, for their hosts, and for the planet. We welcome your continuing partnership in this joyful and life-sustaining enterprise.Happy Earth Day Robin was almost 16 (10th grade) and her brother, Noah, 10 (4th grade), when their parents took them out of school for a seven-month, ten-country tour of Asia. Initially, Robin was resistant to the trip. She did not relish the prospect of sharing a room with her brother and traveling only with her immediate family. \"It was a challenge,\" she said. Today, she looks back on the trip with appreciation. She speculates that for her brother, the trip was less enchanting. People in other countries do not share the Western notion that it is impolite to stare \u2014 or to touch. In Vietnam, people thought it was good luck to reach out and touch Noah's flaxen hair. Robin also remembered a kid following her through the marketplace, once. The kid had never seen a Westerner before. On that family trip, surrounded by Buddhists who lived their religion, Robin and Noah discovered what their parents long knew: religion and culture are inextricably linked for a huge swath of the world's population. \"It motivated me to find my own place in Judaism,\" Robin said. Noah and Joan had similar feelings. At age 50, Joan started learning Hebrew. At 57, she had a Bat-Mitzvah. Will reported feeling more spiritual before he got involved in JOURNEYS. But for him, as for Joan and Robin, there is a deep emotional pull toward the places and people they have come to know. And he still enjoys his myriad travel memories. Given that he is fair, 6'4\", and head and shoulders taller than most people in Southeast Asia, he, like his children, was a curiosity. He remembers waking up, during his Peace Corps days, to find kids staring at him through his window. They'd been watching him sleep. As I marveled at the relaxed, collegial atmosphere among parents and child, I thought of a remark that Joan had made early in our acquaintance. \"Our job,\" she said, \"is to plan itineraries and keep travelers safe.\" The word \"safety\" came up many times. For me, the word conjured up wild animals. After all, JOURNEYS' brochures include beautiful photos of lions, hippos, rhinos, snakes, monkeys, and poisonous frogs \u2014 in addition to smiling human faces of all hues, some on the backs of camels, elephants, donkeys, and horses. Asked whether my wild animals association to dangers was on the mark, the Webers laughed. \"Safari safety is not something we worry about!\" She explained that on a driving safari, \"animals know that no one in vehicles will threaten them. In those kinds of parks, you don't get out and stretch your legs.\" On the other Joan & Will Weber My first visit to JOURNEYS' spacious suite of offices took me to the west side of town, off Jackson Road, near the string of car dealerships.

The sticks are like giant forked tongues \u2014 but bigger than those of these creatures. \"It stops them cold, like magic,\" said Joan. She took the moment to express her appreciation and admiration for JOURNEYS' guides. \"They are so familiar with everything! And they protect us.\" JOURNEYS' staff works hard to protect clients from all kinds of hazards. One of the dangers is bad advice. \"People think that with the Internet, they can plan their own travels,\" said Joan. But the Internet does not explain the reasons for travelers' advisories. The State Department, for instance, advises people to be careful in Johannesburg, South Africa. It is dangerous to change money in the airport. Why? Poachers often wait at the airport to see who changes money there. Those travelers may be targeted and their taxis followed. When they disembark, the poachers pounce. JOURNEYS' staff also understands local political events more readily than the average traveler. If, while traveling with JOURNEYS, one stumbles on a sudden crowd, or a street demonstration, the JOURNEYS staff will know how to skirt it. Staff will also recognize which scenes pose real threats. Food, too, may pose conundrums. JOURNEYS' guides look at the kitchens to make sure they're safe. They'll talk to the chef, choose fresh food, make sure there's refrigeration, make sure foods are thoroughly cooked, and offer clients guidance on the menu. Robin and Will point out that natives have a different internal ecology. Westerners' stomachs haven't built up tolerance to new pathogens. Health concerns notwithstanding, native cuisine is an important part of travel, and the Webers make sure to incorporate a range of culinary experiences. If someone wants to eat snake, the Webers help them find the safest place to eat snake. Food vendors are popular in many parts of the world, and in some countries, eating their food can be a great experience. But one must take precautions. The food must be fresh and hot. If it's not, avoid it. Likewise, eat only cooked vegetables. Don't eat the skin of fruit. Drink bottled water. In Patagonia, for instance, it is usually safe to drink from fresh spring waters. But guides will prohibit travelers from drinking spring water if they know, for instance, that there's a horse camp upstream. It is important, too, to recognize social and religious norms. In Nepal, for instance, people form rice balls with their fingers, dip them in broth, and eat. But it's to be done only with the right hand. The left hand is ritually unclean and must never touch food. Hinduism ritualizes parts of the body, and one must know those rituals to avoid gaffes. The top of the head is sacred. Feet are unclean, even profane. When many people sleep in a room, they sleep in a circle, so that no one's feet point at anyone's head. Gestures of respect, too, must be learned. In a Namaste greeting, the higher one's hands, the more honor they confer. An ordinary Namaste is very familiar. Similarly, a bowed head increases respect. In many places, one must be aware of society's hierarchies, especially where the caste system prevails. In much of the world, Will pointed out, the concept \"all men are created equal\" has no currency.On that family trip, surrounded by Buddhists who lived their religion, Robin and Noah discovered what their parents long knew: religion and culture are inextricably linked for a huge swath of the world's population. \"It motivated me to find my own place in Judaism,\" Robin said. 25th anniversary trip to Thailand Robin Weber Pollak, now president of JOURNEYSContinued from page 45photo by joni strickfaden Joan Weber and Robin Weber Pollak photo by joni strickfaden Celebraang our 21st year of hos ang women's and men's retreats, personalized milestone birthday celebraaons and family reunions.

I asked whether they might share any such incidents. They told of a trip they took in June 2001, a few months before September 11. They were scheduled to fly to Kathmandu, when they got a call from Pemba that the entire Nepalese royal family was massacred in the palace. The murderer was either the crown prince or king's brother. In any case, the king's brother became king (a Claudius for our time). The Webers understood that this was either the best or the worst time to go there. In the best scenario, the travelers would be safe and the people in Kathmandu \"hyper-real\" and \"witnesses to history\" (Joan's words). By this time, the airline tickets were booked for Bangkok, so they designed an alternative, backup trip, to Myanmar (Burma). The Burmese crew knew the trip might not happen. But in the end, the group went to Nepal and had a fabulous 12 days. People everywhere celebrated the royal family. They put up pictures and marked the place where the king was cremated. They showed where his ashes went into the river. I was eager for more stories. The Webers told of an adventure in Kerala, in southern India, in 2005. The group arrived to find that their reserved hotel rooms were given to a different V.I.P . group. Clients were miffed, but the Webers found an alternate place for the first nights of their stay. A few nights later, when they were invited back to the hotel of choice, the management gave the group complimentary massages and did everyone's laundry. Since JOURNEYS is a reputable company, the hotel wanted to make amends. But, said Joan, \"you're always walking a line between outrage and practicality.\" Much of the outrage is absorbed by the Webers and their staff who are adept at camouflaging the extent of a problem \u2014 and correcting it. Alumni testify to the joys of traveling with JOURNEYS. Ann Arborites Phyllis and David Herzig are among them. The Herzigs are seasoned travelers who have, between them, circumnavigated the globe. Over the years, David has planned many trips to Europe, but they took a JOURNEYS land-based trip to Alaska. (Like many environmentally conscious travelers, they shun cruises.) They also went with JOURNEYS to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and Panama. In 2012, they took their children and grandchildren on a family trip to Costa Rica, a JOURNEYS adventure that The Wall Street Journal listed among the ten best trips to take with grandchildren. Last summer, the Herzigs took the family on the JOURNEYS trip to Tanzania. David Herzig described their JOURNEYS adventures as \"well-planned.\" In Costa Rica, he said, \"JOURNEYS was sensitive to everyone's needs. The kids were all in the same age-range, and there were activities each day for all ages.\" David told of the kids' week-long scavenger hunt, a game that involved identifying, not collecting, items. Kids learned to recognize the flora and fauna of the area, became experts on butterflies, and studied luminescent frogs. David marveled that \"kids learned without realizing that they were learning.\" Naturalists enriched the experience for adults and children alike. After a bat specialist took the group through the life cycle of bats, demonstrating the various ways they protect the eco-systems of the world, many were suddenly persuaded that bats were not so frightening, after all. A bird-watching expert showed people where to look and what to see. A trip to a cocoa plantation involved crossing a rope bridge \u2014 to the children's delight. Watching the cocoa bean turned into powder, and finally into chocolate ice cream, perfected the day. Other activities included visits to a rainforest, a preserve, a banana plantation. For the kids, there was the daily, lunchtime romp in the pool, nestled in the mountainside facility. Travelers stayed in bungalows along the river, ate buffet-style, communal meals, and watched the monkeys in the trees beyond. Ruth Schekter, co-owner of Crazy Wisdom Bookstore, is equally enthusiastic about a JOURNEYS trip she took in February of 2013. That trip, called \"Mindfully Engaging Guatemala,\" was limited to eight women. In addition to the group's native guide, Olga, it included two leaders: therapist and meditation teacher Lynn Sipher and Joan Weber. Ruth found all three impressive. Joan and Olga were participant-leaders, joining the daily meditation sessions. Basic instruction with Lynn began the very first night in Antigua, in the open air courtyard in the rooftop garden. \"It was amazing,\" said Ruth, describing the view of rooftops and volcanos that ring the city. The group meditated mornings and evenings each day. The group's guide, an artist and weaver, brought the women to her art studio, where she taught them how to make dyes and let them create their own pieces. She took them to museums, instructed them on Mayan history, and led them on tours through two of the villages on Lake Atitl\u00e1n. She taught them about Mayan values, spirituality, and way of life. \"It was a transformative trip,\" said Ruth, who appreciated how well the leaders worked together. \"I found Joan inspiring to travel with,\" Ruth began, then rhapsodized about Joan and the role she played on this trip. \"It was seamless, which speaks to her incredible skill and experience, her openness and vulnerability.\" Recalling the sweep of the journey, Ruth concluded: She did what you'd want a tour leader to do. She did it out of her own enjoyment of people. She speaks Spanish. She has a gregariousness, a joyful ease with which she interacts with people \u2014 in markets, in restaurants \u2014 that's infectious. She knew the majority of people on this trip, but there was never a sense of cliquishness. Joan reports that the company was surprised at how quickly this trip filled up after it was announced. It will be offered again. JOURNEYS' many destinations have attracted travelers from all over the country. How? Partly by word-of-mouth, partly through their website (www.journeys.travel), and partly making the \"Best of\" lists in Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler, National Geographic's Adventure, National Geographic's Traveler, and Travel and Leisure. Many travelers require small groups and flexibility, which is JOURNEYS' fort\u00e9. The website is filled with stories, itineraries, and photos \u2014 and prices. The Webers try to be transparent about costs, but they do not break the price down to nightly hotel fares. The price range is wide, depending on the length of stay and the level of luxury a traveler chooses. That so many alumni return to travel repeatedly with JOURNEYS reflects a high level of satisfaction. Ann Arborites scrolling through the JOURNEYS website may recognize some of the faces. Alumni gathered in Ann Arbor for JOURNEYS' 35 th Anniversary Jamboree, in the fall of 2013. The event was a reunion and celebration. The warmth was palpable even for non-alumni who attended the events that were open to the public. Travelers swapped stories, hugged, and reminisced. Several Ann Arbor alumni played host to the guides who led them on trips in their native countries. Many travelers came equipped with photo albums, either in old-fashioned form or in iPads and iPhones. In the months before the Jamboree, JOURNEYS' headquarters brimmed with excitement, as staff anticipated the arrival of many overseas partners. Visitors included guides from Nepal, Myanmar, Bhutan, Ladakh, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, India, Turkey, Panama, and China. Most of the weekend's events were open only to travel alumni, and participants were limited to 120. Invitations went out to those who had taken multiple JOURNEYS trips. The celebration marked the official In many places, one must be aware of society's hierarchies, especially where the caste system prevails. In much of the world, Will pointed out, the concept \"all men are created equal\" has no currency. \"JOURNEYS was sensitive to everyone's needs.

It was seamless, which speaks to her incredible skill and experience, her openness and vulnerability.\" \u2014Ruth Schekter, about her trip to Guatemala JOURNEYS group in Mexico Continued on page 48transition to the next generation. Joan and Will Weber ceremoniously handed the reins to their daughter, Robin Weber Pollak, now president of the company. The Jamboree weekend featured a storytelling event at the Michigan Theater. The six storytellers on the program included three JOURNEYS alumni and the three Webers who run the company: Will, Robin, and Joan. Telling stories is a time-honored way to travel in place \u2014 and of whetting one's appetite for adventure. In recent years, the Webers have been collecting and posting some of their seminal stories on their website. Each of these stories begins: \"Once upon a time.\" The story of JOURNEYS' partner in Myanmar, Kishan Chetry, appears on JOURNEYS' website under the title: \"Once Upon a Time in Rangoon.\" Kishan, who attended the Jamboree with his family, is part of the Webers' extended family. He was introduced to the Webers in 1986, three years before the military crackdown in Burma. Some friends of the Webers were traveling in Rangoon, took a taxi, and were impressed by their driver. They told them about him. The Webers sent an aerogram, and Kishan was soon JOURNEYS' man in Burma. As a young man, Kishan dreamed of being a tour guide. He taught himself English and worked odd jobs while searching for his big break. When it came, Kishan trained guides and drivers, found local hosts, and became Burma's first licensed private tour operator. He thrived, despite two decades of military rule. He called his business \"JOURNEYS Nature and Culture Explorations.\" The Webers have often been asked why they continued their travels to Burma in the face of the coup that put the country under military dictatorship. They were warned that visiting Burma, renamed \"Myanmar\" by the country's military leaders, was unpopular and could hurt their company. JOURNEYS was placed on an international \"Dirty Dozen\" list for defying the international boycott. But the Webers are convinced they did the Burmese a service by encouraging visitors. They also point out that Kishan was at the forefront of the relief effort after the 2008 Cyclone Nargis, deemed the greatest disaster in Burmese history, with an estimated 138,000 lives lost. In spite of the devastation, the suspicious Myanmar government thwarted international relief efforts. Kishan led his tourist industry colleagues in mobilizing vehicles and manpower to rescue and care for refugees. At the Ann Arbor Jamboree in 2013, Kishan and his family got to meet other members of the Webers' international family. They met Nawang and Anchee Sherpa, son and widow of Pemba, who died at home in Nepal in 2009. It was Nawang who sent a grateful note to the Webers after receiving the souvenir photo book from Joan. She had lovingly compiled it for Pemba upon learning of his illness. Nawang wrote: I want to start off by thanking you, Joan and everyone who sent their well wishes for Papa. He was very excited and happy to read all those mails and greeting cards and the surprise was that Papa knew each and every one of them. The album Joan made for Papa was priceless. I wish I could have taken a picture of his expression as he was flipping through the pages. I have that image in my head and I will cherish that for the rest of my life. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. I do not know how exactly to say this, Will, but Papa is no more, he passed away today 14 th May at 8:40 p.m. Mama and I are both trying to be as strong as possible. We brought him home around 11 p.m. and are having the monks read the holy books. I will be in touch, take care, our greeting to you and your family... Nawang. Nawang is the same age as Robin Weber Pollak. At the Jamboree, they recalled trekking together in Burma when they were four years old. The slide show that accompanied that session included a photo of Robin, age four, in a basket on a sherpa's back. The two are akin to cousins. Now that each heads the family business, they are also colleagues. Nawang still lives near his mother in Kathmandu. His two siblings are in California, where the oldest, also called Pemba, is a chef and restauranteur. The youngest, a sister, assists him. Over the years, the Weber and Sherpa families have celebrated many milestones together. It is a testament to their bond that when Pemba married his Anchee over thirty years ago, Will performed the ceremonial office of father. I asked Joan how she and Will managed to establish this enterprise, which takes travelers to so many far-flung places. Joan replied that growing slowly was key. If our ambitions had been grand in the early days, to offer sixty plus countries and maintain a database with tens of thousands of prospective travelers as we do now, we might have frozen in our tracks. Instead, we put one foot in front of the other, figuring things out along the way \u2014 learning the countries, testing itineraries, building our relationships. Those things have never ceased to be thrilling. So much of the gift of our lives has been the relationships we established in other countries. Our mission is to find people we feel comfortable with, people we trust, people who will guide our clients. How can we take money from travelers and promise them a good, rewarding time, unless we have people outside that we can trust? We knew that Pemba would always make good on his promise. And travel had to contribute to conservation. It came out of our generation's mindset. People in the high Himalayas were stripping the mountainside for firewood. Erosion problems were a nightmare. Tourism has played a huge part in protection. People are paying to see the trees not cut down. The word \"eco-tourism\" has been coopted \u2014 by hotels, by travel companies. Sustainable, responsible, green tourism contributes to the ecology of the planet. ### For more information, visit www.journeys.travel or email info@journeys.travel.Alumni gathered in Ann Arbor for JOURNEYS' 35th Anniversary Jamboree, in the fall 2013.

The Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra's program \"A Taste of Music\" will bring musicians to the markets, and the Ann Arbor Farmers' Market iPad Translation program will translate key phrases into Mandarin, Russian, and Spanish to better serve the expanding population of shoppers from different cultural backgrounds. Both of these programs aim to reach families and young people who receive federal assistance on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP \u2014 formerly known as food stamps) and who take advantage of Fair Food Network's Double Up Food Bucks program. Fair Food Network is a national nonprofit organization based in Ann Arbor, founded on the belief that vibrant local food systems can create health and economic opportunity for all. Its Double Up Food Bucks program provides low-income shoppers who receive SNAP benefits with a one-to-one match up to $20 per market day to purchase locally grown fruits and vegetables at participating farmers' markets. Double Up demonstrates how we can meet the immediate food needs of low-income Americans in ways that boost healthy eating, support farmers, and stimulate economic activity. Due to the success of the Double Up program in bringing more than $353,286 in extra spending money to customers at participating Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti farmers' markets since 2010, more people who use SNAP benefits are shopping at farmers' markets, diversifying the customer base with shoppers who have limited English proficiency. To give you a sense of the new populations available to utilize these assistance programs now that EBT (electronic benefit transfer) transactions and the SNAP program have moved into farmers' markets, in Washtenaw County, over 35,000 individuals receive SNAP \u2014 14,196 of whom are children. Since 2010, statewide in Michigan, 182,774 Double Up customers purchased healthy, fresh local produce at farmers' markets. About 20 percent were first-time market customers. The influx of new and different shoppers of widely different ages and cultural and language backgrounds has stimulated ideas for innovation from market personnel. In 2013, the Ann Arbor Famers' Market received a Customer Service Grant from the City of Ann Arbor, enabling the purchase of an iPad with translation applications to improve the communication between market staff and their customers. It was Sarah DeWitt, market manager, and her assistant, Carrie DeWitt, who initiated the translation program. Sarah enthusiastically commented: \"The program is stretching our idea of customer service.\" They wanted to provide better information and more satisfying interactions with market visitors. The translation application allows staff members to interact one-to-one with customers and offer details about the Double Up program. A feedback log tracks how many people they are communicating with, in what languages, and the type of questions customers are asking. This enables staff to learn basic greetings, answer frequently asked questions, and help community members feel more comfortable when they visit the markets. St aff members ask all customers using the Double Up program two questions: Is this your first time using your Bridge Card (EBT) at this market? Is the Double Up program one of the reasons you are visiting the market today? These questions are asked of all customers statewide and help Fair Food Network collect the valuable data that demonstrate how this model program can have an impact not only on the physical health of the shopper but also on the economic wellbeing of the community. With the addition of the iPad, these questions are being translated into Mandarin, Russian, and Spanish, and are available to shoppers in laminated signs. The success of this translation pilot could lead to its use in other Ann Arbor Parks situations. The goodwill the program generates more than pays for itself in community cohesiveness \u2014 a priceless commodity Ann Arbor seems very able to cultivate through its positive attitude, service orientation, and attention to the needs of diverse populations. \"A Taste of Music: The Ann Arbor Symphony Goes to the Farmers' Market\" is yet another innovative program that illustrates the creativity and outreach of our local institutions. Fair Food Network was pleased to write a letter of support to the Community Foundation of Southeast Michigan on behalf of this highly complementary program. With a generous grant from the Foundation, A2SO will be presenting two popular components of its Education and Outreach programming \u2014 chamber concerts and the Instrument Petting Zoo \u2014 each summer for three years. \"A Taste of Music\" will offer 12 free outdoor concerts at six area markets: Ann Arbor Farmers' Market; Ann Arbor West; Ypsilanti; and South Lyon. The ensembles will include trios, quartets, and other combinations of professional musicians who have also gone out to schools, libraries, retirement centers, and other community locales. Even more exciting for our children is the Instrument Petting Zoo, where kids can play instruments of all kinds and sizes. \"Zookeepers\" will be available to help children hold and experiment with the appropriate size of instrument they may want to touch and play. This program has been successful in libraries, shopping malls, daycare centers, and other venues that service a wide range of people from different cultural and economic backgrounds. Furthering its commitment to the community, A2S0 will also distribute vouchers to up to 700 SNAP/Double Up shoppers for free access to Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra concerts, bringing live symphony music to a new audience and a new generation of young people. \"A Taste of Music\" hopes to illustrate how live symphony music can be an integral part of our lives, just as Fair Food Network's Double Up Food Bucks program and the Ann Arbor Farmers' Market Translation project help a new population of shoppers make healthy, fresh local fruits and vegetables an integral part of their lives. What better place to bring these goals together than at our local farmers' markets where the sounds, smells, and sights converge in perfect harmony.

One that gives us the collective ability to feed ourselves sustainably for generations to come; one that provides healthy, safe food for all. A system where most of this food comes from local, organic farms that don't work against nature, but with it; where farmers grow crops from a wide choice of seeds that are uniquely adapted to the climate, soil, and conditions on the farm, and these seeds produce an abundance of nutritious and delicious food. Miracle in a Package Seeds are like a miracle in a small package (unless we're talking coconuts). Often I find myself looking down, holding a small collection of seeds in my hand, and I am reminded how each one is living and breathing, just as I am. I know if I take these seeds and tuck them into the soil under the right conditions, those tiny promises will take in the earth's water, bringing about a magical series of internal metabolic changes: the beginning of new life. I, along with my partner, Mike Levine, own Nature and Nurture, LLC, a local organic landscaping business. Recently, we launched Nature and Nurture Seeds and began selling sustainably grown, heirloom vegetable seeds. Our mission is to be a catalyst for the preservation and innovation of food seed biodiversity in the Great Lakes region. Seeds are a plant's way of reproducing itself. During the creation of a seed, through the magic of pollination, genetic mixing occurs, making each new seed completely unique. Each seed has the potential to contain new traits that make it survive better in nature or, in the case of agriculture, that make it more beneficial for people. The more our food crops are allowed to make seed (and those seeds are subsequently replanted), the more opportunities there will be for new genetic combinations resulting in increased biodiversity. A Collective Heritage So where did the seeds of our food crops come from? As human beings went from being hunter-gatherers to farmers, our ancestors began to grow plants intentionally, as opposed to hunting or foraging for wild food. At some point, our ancestors began collecting seeds from wild plants and sowing them upon the land. As they did this, they identified new traits and learned to save seeds from the best plants \u2014 plants that were easier to grow, produced more food, or were resistant to pests, drought, heat, cold, or flooding. Each selection changed the genetic make-up of the plants, making them better adapted to grow under the conditions in which they found themselves. Humans, dispersed all over the planet, carried out this process, and when we traveled and migrated, we carried seeds stitched under our clothing. These coveted seeds were traded and planted in new places, leading to genetic mixing and, ultimately, to increased biodiversity. (For a great read about the history of our food, see Where Our Food Comes From by Gary Nabhan.) Over thousands of years, these ancient farmers domesticated wild plants \u2014 plants that were toxic, thorny, difficult to grow, and unpleasantly bitter \u2014 into the astonishing, abundant diversity of crops that we have today. Even though they knew nothing about the science of genetics, our indigenous farming ancestors were well attuned to something we seem to have forgotten: that genetic diversity means food security. They intentionally maintained genetic diversity within crops because they knew that particular plants would produce food during droughts or floods while others would provide nourishment during hot years, cold years, or during pest infestations. It is because of this diversity that we are able to be here today to tell this story; it is precisely because our ancestors had food in their bellies generation after generation; and it is our presence that is living proof that there was not one break in the chain. The seeds of our ancestors are held in what is known as \"the commons.\" The commons refers to the collective cultural and natural resources accessible to all and include things like air and water. These resources are held in common by the public and are not (or should not be) privately owned. For most of our country's history, our patent laws precluded the patenting of plants, which meant that all plants, seeds, and their genetics were held in the commons. However, the patenting of food plants, which has increased exponentially in the last ten years, has meant the removal of countless seeds from the public commons. In reflecting back at the history of our food, I am reminded that our food crops are the collective heritage of us all. By what right does anyone have to own or control that which we have inherited from our ancestors? My Seed Education Growing up on the Old West Side of Ann Arbor, summer usually found me in our family's vegetable garden. Standing barefoot in the garden as the delightful juice of a ripe tomato ran down my chin, I found myself fully embodied in the moment. Somehow the entire sensory experience felt primal in a way that spoke to a deep need for connection to food and nature. Seeds for the Future Often I find myself looking down, holding a small collection of seeds in my hand, and I am reminded how each one is living and breathing, just as I am . For most of our country's history, our patent laws precluded the patenting of plants, which meant that all plants, seeds, and their genetics were held in the commons.

Instead of blaming farmers for growing commercial F1 hybrids, we need to encourage them to be seed stewards. Erica Kempter laying out vegetable garden beds for a Nature and Nurture landscaping client Odawa Pole Bean seeds from the Odawa Native American tribe, Harbor Springs, MichiganA Local Organic Seed Grower Explains the Importance of the Emerging Seed MovementThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 51 These early experiences stayed with me, and when I entered college at the University of Michigan in 1991, I started my first vegetable garden and began my own organic landscape gardening business. Eventually my interest in organic gardening and food grew and I transferred to the University of California, Santa Cruz, which, at the time, was the only major university to have an organic farm on campus. As a student, I was particularly drawn to sustainable agriculture for its capacity to address social, health, and environmental issues in a tangible, solution oriented way. I returned to Ann Arbor in 1998 and, in 2001, founded Nature and Nurture, LLC, with Mike Levine. My obsession with seeds began with a \"chance\" event: my meeting the pre-eminent organic seed breeder, advocate, and mentor John Navazio on an airplane in 2002. While I was perusing seed catalogs, he took notice, leaned across the aisle, and we became engaged in a long conversation about seeds. I told him what my favorite tomato variety was and he began to explain that, since it was a commercial F1 hybrid, eventually the variety would be dropped from seed catalogs (for financial and/or biological reasons); and since you can't save seeds from F1 hybrids, that would be the end. This was shocking news to me \u2014 how could my treasured tomato just disappear into thin air? At this point in my life, I already knew that the last hundred years had seen a drastic change in the way people grow food with the widespread adoption of industrial farming systems, leading to consequences that we are still trying to understand. Consequences like diabetes and heart disease caused from the overconsumption of low nutrition, processed foods and negative health effects from chemical exposure. More and more we hear of e. coli and salmonellae contamination, which has sickened and even killed numerous individuals. Not only is industrial farming hurting us, it's also destroying our planet, where it erodes our soil, pollutes our air and water, and drives natural ecosystems into dramatic reductions of biodiversity or complete species extinction. The effects have sent a shockwave through cultures, tearing apart rural communities, destroying culinary heritage, and hurting us socially and psychologically by dismantling the great tradition of celebrating the food we grow around a communal dinner table. Part of this change has been the switch from open-pollinated (OP) seeds (the kinds of seeds that our ancestors developed) to the widespread adoption of commercial F1 hybrids. As I began to research more about seeds, I learned that F1 hybrids are typically bred in conventional farming systems, meaning they are exposed to significant amounts of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. This breeding process, in effect, creates (selects genes by default for) wimpy plants that require the protection of pesticides and dependency on chemical fertilizers in order to perform their best. Consequently, researchers have found in recent years that commercial F1 hybrid seeds often underperform in organic farming systems when compared to open-pollinated varieties that have been bred in organic farming systems. Unlike commercial hybrids, \"open-pollinated\" varieties, sometimes called \"heirlooms,\" have the capacity to be constantly and infinitely selected, bred, and adapted to the food needs of human beings. Hybridization is not bad, in itself, but, since farmers do not save and replant F1 hybrid seeds, this is the end-of-the-line for that hybrid \u2014 no evolution, no ability to adapt to the unique and constantly changing conditions, climates, soils, and pests that occur on each farm, in each region. F1 hybrids are evolutionary dead-ends and thus perpetuate the loss of seed biodiversity. Another consequence of the large-scale adoption of F1 hybrids has meant that, in the U.S., we've essentially dismantled the age-old process of growing, selecting, breeding, and saving seeds; consequently, farmers have lost the knowledge and skills that went with it, organic farmers included. It also has meant the transfer of enormous resources from OP's into F1 hybrids and the consequential loss of open-pollinated varieties. In the past 100 years, 94 percent of open-pollinated vegetable varieties have been lost; they are literally extinct, and the potentially beneficial genes they contained are gone forever. Due to major changes in the structure of the seed industry in the last forty years, the open-pollinated seeds that remain have been seriously neglected. Up until the 1970s most seed companies were regionally based and independently owned, but starting in the '70s, pharmaceutical and chemical corporations began buying up these seed companies. During this process, many of the open-pollinated varieties carried by these smaller companies were dropped. This buying trend increased with great gusto in the 1990s to the present, leading to extreme consolidation and monopoly in the seed industry, meaning that today the seed industry is ultimately controlled by a handful of these big corporations driven by the profit motive. Open-pollinated varieties simply don't have the financial support needed to be properly maintained and their quality has suffered on account of it. (For a visual representation of the changes in the seed industry, see below \u2014 Michigan State University's Phil Howard's \"Seed Industry Structure.\") Michigan State University's Phil Howard's \"Seed Industry Structure.\" This is only a partial graph.

If you are wondering what you can do in your daily life, I would start by saying that the act of growing food is transformative; that our souls yearn for deeper connection that can be satisfied through the growing of one's own food.

To do it, I saved the seeds from the favorite F1 hybrid tomato fruit and, in the following year, planted 100 of those seeds. I was completely blown away to see that every single tomato plant was different. The plants themselves varied in vigor, disease resistance, and other traits, but where the differences really stood out was in the fruit. The tomatoes ranged in size from small to large, round to oval, juicy to dry, tasty to down-right spitters. I saved seeds from those plants and have been selecting them for the qualities that I love in the F1 hybrid. Eventually, my tomato will be an open-pollinated plant with characteristics more or less like the F1 hybrid. This project really opened a door for me, revealing a whole new world, and allowed me to feel empowered to be a plant breeder. The Importance of Biodiversity & the Precarious Foundation of Seeds The trends toward planting commercial hybrids and patenting food plants are stifling innovation, and thus have the potential to severely limit the diversity of our food crops into the future. Seemingly we still haven't learned from examples like the Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s. We all know a little about the story, where extreme starvation resulted in Ireland because one third of the population was dependent on one variety of potato. What we should have learned is that when you bank on genetic uniformity, you're in trouble when a disease like Late Blight comes in and spreads to every available host, wiping out every potato. From 1846 to 1851, at least 20 percent of Ireland's population died as a result. We need to be reminded that our crops are still susceptible to a constant and ever- changing barrage of pests and diseases. As climate change becomes increasingly problematic, our crops are becoming even more vulnerable to the extremes of nature. More and more we require genetic diversity to provide our crops with resiliency to these current and future threats. As human beings we are at a critical juncture. We have come to depend on an industrialized, unsustainable, chemical-based, agricultural system built on a precarious foundation of seeds. I think it's time we start seriously asking ourselves if this type of agriculture can provide healthy, sustainable food for generations to come. The Movement to Save Seeds For many years there has been a significant seed preservation movement in the U.S. Consisting mostly of home gardeners growing and saving threatened OP vegetable varieties, this work has been a very important stopgap measure to minimize the further loss of seeds. At the forefront of this work has been the nonprofit organization Seed Savers Exchange, located in Decorah, Iowa. Beginning around Seeds for the Future 2000, leading thinkers in the seed movement began questioning whether seed preservation alone was enough to make the fundamental changes needed in our seed system and the nonprofit organization Organic Seed Alliance in Port Townsend, Washington, was born. With a focus on promoting seed stewardship and innovation among farmers, as well as working on research, education, and advocacy, the Organic Seed Alliance seeks to make lasting change in the seed system. Inspired by the work of the Organic Seed Alliance, I began to research the seed history in the Great Lakes region and came across a copy of Renewing America's Food Tradition's Place-Based Foods at Risk in the Great Lakes. Compiled by Gary Nabhan, this small book kindled a vital passion in me to explore the food heritage of the place I call home. The first thing that I discovered in my quest was that, other than this little booklet, scant information exists about Great Lakes regional seeds. The idea for Nature and Nurture Seeds was born. One of the early Great Lakes varieties that we trialed was Grand Rapids Lettuce. Grand Rapids Lettuce was developed around the turn of the 20 th century in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where it was grown in hundreds of greenhouses that fed people lettuce during the winter. At Nature and Nurture Seeds, we have been growing this lettuce in our unheated hoophouse over the winter where cold temperatures and disease kill many other lettuce varieties. Grand Rapids Lettuce has outperformed many of the lettuces that we have trialed. For three years we have been growing it for seed, letting disease and cold kill the weak plants and selecting and saving seeds from the most cold hardy and disease resistant plants. This past winter was a great year for selecting for cold hardiness! Over time, our strain of Grand Rapids Lettuce is becoming more and more adapted to a southeast Michigan hoophouse growing environment. We offer packets of Grand Rapids seeds through our seed catalog, but it is my hope that eventually our strain will be beneficial for the many market growers in our region who do winter hoophouse production. We have many projects like Grand Rapids Lettuce, all with these goals: increasing the biodiversity in our food crops; having regionally adapted varieties; increasing the seed choices of farmers; and ultimately contributing to the ability of our region to feed ourselves. We trial, grow, and offer varieties that are vigorous, high yielding, and have good taste. Thirty percent of our seeds this year are locally grown \u2014 either by us or by partnerships with other local growers. We hope to increase that percent every year.Continued from page 51 Seemingly we still haven't learned from examples like the Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s.As human beings we are at a critical juncture. We have come to depend on an industrialized, unsustainable, chemical-based, agricultural system built on a precarious foundation of seeds. One thing that we've learned from the organic food movement is that it really does matter how we decide to spend our money. So if you are a gardener, vote with your dollars!The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 53 Here in Southeast Michigan there are several organizations working on seeds. Annie Elder and Paul Bantle of Community Farm of Ann Arbor have been seed savers for many years, using saved seeds to grow many of their crops. Support Paul and Annie's seed saving work by joining their C.S.A.! Project Grow Community Gardens is an Ann Arbor-based community garden organization that provides garden plots to the public. They have long been involved in heirloom seed saving projects and are always looking for new people to get involved. Greg Vaclavek of the Native Plant Nursery collects over 200 species of native plant seeds (with required permits and permissions) following ethical seed collecting guidelines. He uses the collected seed to grow native plants that he sells at the Ann Arbor Farmers' Market. Recently, I learned that the Lyon Township Public Library (near South Lyon) has a Seed Library. Seed libraries provide a community service by lending free seeds and then encouraging borrowers to return a portion of their seeds from their harvests to the library to make the seed library self-sustaining. They also provide many seed saving resources and hold related events. Mike and I were happy this year to be able donate seeds to support the work of the Lyon Seed Library. Slow Food Huron Valley, the local chapter of the international Slow Food organization, has been working on several Great Lakes Heirloom Seed projects. Along with my company, Nature and Nurture Seeds, which sells seeds online, by mail, or by phone order, there is another local seed business called Ann Arbor Seed Company. Owned by Eric Kampe and Meredith Kahn, Ann Arbor Seed Company sells 100 percent locally grown seeds via local retailers and at the Ann Arbor Farmers' Market. If you are wondering what you can do in your daily life, I would start by saying that the act of growing food is transformative; that our souls yearn for deeper connection that can be satisfied through the growing of one's own food. Seeds embody an intimate connection to nature's biodiversity and working directly with them gives us a connection to those who have come before us. Start a garden. Save seeds. If that sounds difficult, start simple. Beans, peas, and tomatoes are super easy plants for seed saving, not to mention they are yummy to eat. And once you start gardening, you can share the bounty with family, friends, and neighbors. One thing that we've learned from the organic food movement is that it really does matter how we decide to spend our money. So if you are a gardener, vote with your dollars! Buy open-pollinated seeds (all commercial hybrid seeds are labeled \"hybrid\" or \"F1 hybrid\"). I know some folks prefer the sugary sweetness of hybrid sweet corn, so don't feel bad if you don't want to grow 100 percent OP's. But stay tuned, there are OP sweet corn breeding projects in the works, so you may be able to have your sweet OP cake and eat it too! Also, vote with your dollars by avoiding buying patented seeds. Some patented seeds will say \"Utility Patent Granted\" in the variety description. If you want to avoid buying patented seeds and are unsure if certain seeds are patented, ask your seed company. Instead of blaming farmers for growing commercial F1 hybrids, we need to encourage them to be seed stewards. We need to work to give them access to a wide choice of genetically diverse, productive OP varieties. As farmers begin to save seeds, the seeds of each subsequent generation will become more and more regionally and farm adapted. Encourage gardeners and farmers to become farmer/breeders. Plant breeding does not have to occur in ivory towers or laboratories; it can be done with simple methods in fields and gardens by farmers, gardeners, by you and me!It is my hope one day to bring the folks from the Organic Seed Alliance to Michigan to hold workshops on \"Seeds Saving for Farmers and Gardeners,\" \"On-Farm Variety Trials,\" and \"On-Farm Plant Breeding\" in order to engage more local growers in the practices of seed growing and breeding. In addition, permaculture has gained recognition in the last few years. One of the primary tenets of permaculture is using perennial food plants. Unfortunately, there has been very little work done on breeding perennial edible plants and there is a huge need for them, especially in northern climates. A Vision of Seeds for the Future We have created a vision for the kind of food system that we want. So let us dream. Vision gives us direction, and guides us down a path with more clarity, intention, and purpose. Taking the seeds that have been handed down to us, we cradle, protect, nurture, and free them. As a member of homo sapiens who eats, each one of us has a role to play toward the vision, no matter how big or how small. Should we become weary or discouraged, we take refuge in the knowledge that collectively we can accomplish more than any one of us can create alone. We remember that we are standing on the shoulders of our ancestors and we give thanks for all that we have. We celebrate together over abundant, wholesome, delicious food, rejoicing in the knowledge that, because of us, future generations will be celebrating and feasting together. Erica Kempter, along with her partner, Mike Levine, owns Ann Arbor's Nature and Nurture, LLC, which provides organic gardening services, has a fruit and nut tree nursery, grows Shiitake mushrooms, and, in January, began offering sustainably grown, heirloom vegetable seeds through Nature and Nurture Seeds. Erica has been involved in organic gardening and food for twenty years, including leadership in multiple urban gardening projects in California and Detroit, founding the HomeGrown Festival, and involvement in the Local Food Summit. She developed the Organic Gardener Certificate Program at Washtenaw Community College and is a board member of Slow Food Huron Valley.

AUNT BE BOTANICALS The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 54 \"Music is like a key to spiritual blossoming.\" -Annie Rose Cantor Annie at rehearsal with Kol Halev, the Temple Beth Emeth adult choirThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 55 Cantor Annie Rose will retire in July 2014. By then, she will have been the cantor at Temple Beth Emeth (TBE) for twenty years. She has trained countless bar and bat mitzvah students and created and conducted the Temple's adult and youth choirs, Kol Halev (Voice of the Heart) and Shir Chadash (New Song). The adult choir boasts 70 members, a hearty testament to her leadership. Her extraordinary musicianship is matched by a scholarly pursuit of all things Jewish, musical, and spiritual. She combines her love of music with Jewish tradition in the way she teaches young people for their bar and bat mitzvahs, explaining to them how the \"trope,\" or cantillation signage (like musical notation), serves as punctuation for the Torah. Annie, as everyone calls her, tells her bar and bat mitzvah students that the Torah, like most sacred texts, has no syntactical structure. She asks them to imagine a novel written in all caps, with no commas, periods, or punctuation marks. How would they read it? The trope, she explains, is a way to indicate stops and starts. The cantillation signs also provide commentary on the text itself, highlighting important ideas musically. Annie Rose talks about the oral tradition of the Torah, which was kept alive, without a printed text, for generations. The trope may well have been a mnemonic aid. In addition to her ritual duties, Annie Rose has also done a good deal of pastoral counseling: visiting the sick, comforting the bereaved, and guiding the perplexed. Many are drawn to her for her preternatural optimism, her wise approach to life's ups and downs, her compassion. One of her long-standing choir members, Beth Dwoskin, said: \"Most people admire her for her phenomenal people skills and her one hundred percent positive outlook on life. For me, Annie Rose is a musical inspiration. She is a lodestar for people who love Jewish music.\" Several years ago, another member of the choir, Sheila (better known as \"Happy\") Feigelson, conspired with fellow choir members to nominate Annie Rose for the prestigious Covenant Award, a national honor bestowed on Jewish educators. The nomination procedure is complex. Feigelson formed a committee, and together, it composed and submitted the nomination. Annie made the first cut, but she did not win the prize. Still, she wrote to each of the committee members to thank them and to assert that, for her, the real honor was being nominated. In enthusing about Annie Rose, Feigelson also recalled the words that Annie used to announce her retirement: \"I want to be Theo's wife.\" Annie's husband, Theodore Morrison, professor emeritus at the University of Michigan School of Music, wrote an opera that had its premiere in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in July 2013. The opera is slated to tour next year. Annie wanted to be free to attend those concerts with him. She also wants to spend more time with him at home. Given that Annie is known for giving total concentration to the people or task at hand, a trait deeply appreciated by all who know her, it comes as something of a jolt to hear her say: \"My family is the stable core of everything I do. Being a mom has provided the deepest learning and greatest joy of my life.\" But this should not surprise. She attends so fully to those with her at any given moment, that one needs to be reminded that she has a life of her own. Her son is completing a master's in music composition in New York City. Her daughter is a social worker in Washington, DC. Annie Rose was an exemplary role model for each, creating harmony at home while demonstrating the importance of pursuing one's professional goals. For most of their lives, she was a working mom: cantor, choir director, voice teacher, and bar and bat mitzvah tutor. She has also taught, by example, the value of a health regimen. Her office boasts a treadmill-desk. She designed it years before such exercise machine/office desk combinations were in vogue. She simply put together a standard treadmill with a suitable table, and voil\u00e0! Her treadmill desk was ready to mount. She walks while she works at her computer. Annie Rose was born and raised in Philadelphia, where her family belonged to Temple Adath Israel, a Conservative synagogue. She grew up attending religious school, and she continued her Jewish studies through Hebrew high school. \"I loved religious services. I love ritual,\" she said. The year of her brother's bar mitzvah, he was required to attend services regularly. She went with him. They liked sitting up front. Their synagogue featured an organ and a choir. Annie was enamored of the alto soloist, one of \"the fancy ladies,\" as she called them then. \"She [the 'alto lady'] wore hats. I loved her.\" In those days, girls did not aspire to be cantors. So Annie Rose aspired to be a choir soloist in a fancy hat. She also wanted to pitch for the Phillies. \u2014 Her Spirit and Beautiful Voice, A Gift to Temple Beth Emeth and to the Community \u2014Cantor Annie Rose, A Jewish Seeker By Rachel Urist Photography by Susan Ayer \"Most people admire her for her phenomenal people skills and her one hundred percent positive outlook on life. For me, Annie Rose is a musical inspiration. She is a lodestar for people who love Jewish music.\" -Beth Dwoskin, choir member Continued on page 56The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 56 Annie studied music at Goucher College in Baltimore. After graduating, she spent two years on a Watson Fellowship. Equivalent to a Fulbright, this prize is awarded to a select group of students each year and stipulates that the student be far from home during the fellowship year. Annie arranged to study voice, conducting, and music theory in England and France. For the first six months, she lived in London, where she met conductor Antony Hopkins and saw Pierre Boulez, the French composer, conductor, writer, and pianist. She commuted to Paris (by hovercraft) for her music theory lessons with conductor and famed teacher Nadia Boulanger, who conducted their sessions in English. For the second half of the year, she lived in Paris and studied with opera teacher Tosca Marmor, who Annie later discovered had also taught Celine Dion. Marmor conducted Annie's lessons in French. Annie's fluency in the language quickly improved. Her worldview broadened, too. Annie recalls a day when \"Tosca pulled up her sleeves, and I saw a number. I froze.\" Until that moment, Annie did not know that Marmor was a Holocaust survivor. Back in Baltimore, Annie took Hebrew and Yiddish classes at Baltimore College. She also enrolled at the Peabody Institute, where she was a graduate assistant in music theory and earned two master's degrees, in voice and conducting. Theodore Morrison was chair of choral music and director of the chamber orchestra. Annie sang in concerts that he conducted. When their collaborations became personal, she told him she was a committed Jew. He countered that he was an agnostic with no religious affiliation. When their romance became serious, they discussed the prospects of family. It was \"evident\" to both, she said, that they would have a Jewish home with Jewish children. \"He embraced it with fullness and joy,\" said Annie. Noting that at one point Annie identified herself as a \"Reform Jew,\" I asked when and why she made the switch from Conservative to Reform Judaism. After all, she had, to date, been drawn to the sounds, spirit, and philosophical tenets of her parents' Conservative affiliation. (Note that the three primary Jewish denominations, Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Judaism, denote three levels of observance, from the most stringent to the most liberal.) Annie responded with a story. She recalled a snowy night in Baltimore, when she walked from her house to the Conservative synagogue. There she found a small crowd, only five men, a few Torahs, and about eight women. She asked why the service was delayed. Someone answered, \"We don't have a minyan.\" She walked out. (A minyan is a quorum of ten Jewish souls. Ten is the required number for convening a worship service, which is always predicated on community. Until relatively recently, only men were counted for a minyan. Today, Reform and most Conservative Jews count women as well as men for a minyan.) A few weeks after this incident, Annie learned that the cantorial position at Har Sinai, Baltimore's oldest Reform congregation, was open. A classmate urged Annie to audition for the position. Annie was surprised by the encouragement, especially since she had never considered such a job. She wondered how her name came to the synagogue's attention. \"We've heard you sing; we want you to give it a try,\" the classmate said. So she auditioned and got the job. She smiled at the memory. \"By the time Theo and I married, I was the cantor at Har Sinai.\" Annie's professional life has remained firmly within the Jewish world. \"Music is like a key to spiritual blossoming,\" she said. When she sings, her voice is riveting. It is a sweet, strong, lilting mezzo-soprano. She claims that her voice was never operatic, that she never really wanted to do opera. She says that to have a career in opera, one must have a certain vocal range and volume, and her voice does not have that range or volume. She asserted that she never minded that lack. \"I feel I have done good work with the instrument I have, and I have not wanted to ask anything else from my voice. I love singing so much!\" While serving in her first cantorial position for five years, she studied pastoral counseling with Rabbi Abraham Shusterman, Har Sinai's rabbi from 1941 to 1972. She feels indebted to him for showing her the path she has long followed. He was long a member of Baltimore's Interfaith Council, and he was active in the civil rights movement of the 60's. He died in 1995 at age 88. Annie counts among her influences Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, the Polish-American theologian, writer, and social activist. Annie calls him \"one of my all-time heroes.\" Heschel, who famously described the Sabbath as a \"temple in time,\" has many notable quotations. Among them are: \"Wonder rather than doubt is the root of all knowledge\"; \"A Jew is asked to take a leap of action rather than a leap of thought\"; and \"When I marched in Selma, my legs were praying.\" Heschel, descendant of a long line of Hasidic rabbis, earned both rabbinic ordination and a Ph.D. in Berlin. He barely escaped the Holocaust. In 1942, the Nazis shut down the institution that conferred his ordination. Heschel had arrived in New York City two years earlier. In the U.S., he taught at Hebrew Union College (Reform) and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (Conservative). Rabbi Leo Baeck (1873-1956), another of Annie's inspirations, was one of Heschel's professors at the University of Berlin. Baeck, a German scholar, taught that religion Cantor Annie Rose, A Jewish Seeker Annie Rose, the girl who once aspired to be the choir lady, now inspires others to be like Annie Rose.Continued from page 55 In those days, girls did not aspire to be cantors. So Annie Rose aspired to be a choir soloist in a fancy hat. She also wanted to pitch for the Phillies. Members of Kol Halev gather around the piano to practice their parts, with accompanist Dr. Ray McLellanThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 57 is faith and action; that if one starts with action, it leads to faith. Baeck was among the early leaders of Progressive Judaism, a movement that led to the branches now known as Liberal, Reform, Reconstructionist, and Progressive. Rabbi Nachman of Bratzlav (1772-1810), the Ukrainian founder of the Breslov (Bratzlav) Hasidic group, is another name Annie mentions frequently. Reb Nachman's folksy tales are notable for their themes of menschlichkeit (human decency), devotion to God, and loyalty to one's fellows. He also promotes lightheartedness. Annie said: \"How important it is for us to remember the fundamental benefits of joy and laughter!\" Some of Reb Nachman's articles of faith include: Remember: joy is not merely incidental to your spiritual quest, it is vital. Nothing is as liberating as joy. It frees the mind and fills it with tranquility. If you are happy, the whole world benefits. Annie also appreciates Reb Nachman's unusual prayer, \"Thank you for this moment,\" which he offered in times of great personal challenge. After all, it is life's difficult moments that build character and resilience. She credits Moses Maimonides (1135-1204), the Spanish-born philosopher, physician, and Torah scholar, (also known as Rambam, the Hebrew acronym for Rabbi Moshe Ben Maimon) for giving us the notion of God as the pure idea, a power that can be neither described nor named. She drew parallels between this idea and similar concepts in Eastern philosophies. She quotes the Chinese thinker, the 6 th century B.C.E. Loz (or Lao Tzu, \"Old Master\"), who wrote the Tao Te Ching (pronounced Dao De Jing ). The title means, literally: \"the way of virtue.\" In quoting from Loz, she draws implicit parallels to the scene in Exodus, at the burning bush, when Moses asks God what to tell the people, when they ask who sent him: The tao that can be told is not the eternal TaoThe name that can be named is not the eternal Name.The unnameable is the eternally real. Loz's precepts have been influential in Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism. Annie said: \"I am a Jew who is interested in all spiritual paths.\" To get a better sense of the teachings that Annie Rose finds so inspiring, I looked up Loz and the Tao Te Ching . Among his many famous sayings, I find: \"When goodness is lost, it is replaced by morality.\" And, \"Try to change it and you will ruin it. Try to hold it and you will lose it.\" I also find his classic definition of the Tao:There is a thing inherent and natural, which existed before heaven and earth. Motionless and fathomless, it stands alone and never changes. It pervades everywhere and never becomes exhausted. It may be regarded as a name, I call it Tao, and I name it as supreme. Among Annie's contemporary influences is Rabbi Rami Shapiro. Shapiro studied to be a Buddhist monk before earning his rabbinic ordination. From him, Annie learned that \"Buddhism gives us the BE-ness; just being, not doing.\" In addition to the various rabbis who helped shape her philosophical and theological frameworks, Annie has turned to the well-known psychic and medium Rebecca Rosen. Annie has consulted with her for the last ten years and calls her \"the wisest intuitive I have ever known.\" Annie credits Rosen with \"life-changing spiritual coaching,\" and maintains that Rosen's intuition in combination with years of study and experience \"gives her a very deep understanding of God and eternity.\" Annie added: \"Through conversations and classes with her, I have had the opportunity to expand my own thinking and my own prayer practice. Rebecca and Rabbi Shusterman have been my most powerful mentors.\" Shusterman, of course, was the person who steered Annie toward pastoral counseling. I asked Annie how many cantors participate in congregants' lives as deeply and intimately as she does. Annie maintains that she is not unusual in this. The cantor may, typically, be associated with the music, but for Annie, music is a portal to the spiritual. Invoking her classical music training, she pointed out that one cannot sing in anger. In opera one can pretend; one can act out the anger. But music in ritual tends to have a purity of intention. \"When I marched in Selma, my legs were praying.\" -Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, Polish-American theologian, writer, and social activist\"How important it is for us to remember the fundamental benefits of joy and laughter!\" -Annie Rose \"I am a Jew who is interested in all spiritual paths.\" -Annie Rose Continued on page 58 303 Detroit St., Suite 107, Ann Arbor (734) 995-4222Located in the Marketplace Bldg by the Farmers' Sun. 1pm-4pm CollectedWorksAnnArbor.comFeaturing Styles From: FLAX I.C. CollectionNo Blu Cynthia AshbyBryn Walker Tianello Teresa Goodall COMFY The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 58 Cantor Annie Rose, A Jewish Seeker Continued from page 57 For Annie, the role of cantor affords her the opportunity to engage in pastoral counseling, which gives her a special connectedness with people. She loves going through life cycle events with others. In her words: \"People invite you to the center of their lives, when they suffer loss. You come into the family conversation. It's an incredible, a miraculous experience.\" Warming to her theme of connection, she cites portions of liturgy when Jews invoke the names of forefathers, linking those names to the divine, as though seeking worthy intermediaries who might intercede, who might bring the worshiper's prayer directly to God's ear. Hebrew liturgy is full of hymns and personal petitions for \"the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob.\" She urges people to add their own grandparents and great grandparents' names. She explained: \"Then we're all connected forever to this eternal energy.\" In talking about concepts of God and the meaning of prayer, Annie offered this: \"People sometimes object to the Torah's image of God as a dominating man; a threatening God who curses.\" For Annie, God is a more benign and abstract force, one connected to time, being, and energy. She noted the biblical scene of the burning bush, with its attendant conversation between Moses and God. Moses asked God: Who are you? God answered: I am the verb to be. \"I am that I am and will be.\" God, noted Annie, has no beginning and no end. We can say only what God is not, not what God is. Annie explained that when she prays, it is not to appease God, but to remind herself of life's highest values. \"I never pray for something I need; I give thanks for what I have.\" \"I have read far more by great rabbis and other Jewish thinkers, but I am so grateful to have the option to read in other traditions too. I believe we all have a lot to offer each other. I just like to experience beautiful writings by vibrant, spiritually engaged people.\"Annie Rose's spiritual journey has been enriched by time and place. Her physical journey included a move from Baltimore to Northampton, Massachusetts, where her young family stayed for six years, and where Annie taught voice, helped at Hillel (on the campus of Smith College), and served as guest cantor for High Holy Days in the community. In 1987, they arrived in Ann Arbor. She has been a trusted presence on the staff of Temple Beth Emeth since 1994. Temple Beth Emeth, Ann Arbor's Reform synagogue, made history in 1974 when it announced its plans to share a building with St. Clare's Episcopal Church. It was the first such partnership in the U.S. This interdenominational cooperation appealed to Annie, whose Baltimore mentor, Rabbi Abraham Shusterman, had urged interfaith ties. The shared building, on Packard and Eastover, is arresting for its sprawling, contemporary architecture, its airy and spacious sanctuary, and its fine acoustics. The invariably beautiful sounds that Annie Rose elicits from her choral groups are uplifting. Several years ago, her adult choir toured Eastern Europe and, several years later, Argentina. When they performed in Bucharest, people were bussed in from all over the country for the concert. The experience moved singers and audiences alike. Annie Rose is the proverbial seeker. She encourages other seekers. Her voracious reading includes Buddhist texts, particularly those of Thich Nhat Hanh and Pema Chodron, whose practices she finds inspirational. \"I have read far more by great rabbis and other Jewish thinkers, but I am so grateful to have the option to read in other traditions too.

Meditation has become an important part of Annie's life. For the last forty years, she has meditated twice a day. Over the past ten years, she has added prayer to that practice. She said she is drawn to questions about eternity and afterlife. She believes in reincarnation, in eternal souls. She explores notions of energy in the universe.

When someone says \"I don't believe in God,\" Annie likes responding with the rabbinic quip \"I don't believe in the God that you don't believe in, either.\" For Annie Rose, the transition from Conservative Judaism, the branch in which she was raised, to Reform Judaism was unexpected but fulfilling. She still treasures her Conservative roots, and now that egalitarianism is accepted as a central tenet of the movement, she has no axe to grind with it. But her preference is to call herself a Jew, plain and simple, without qualifying modifiers. Those who have seen but not heard Annie Rose will recognize her for her trademark, waist-length hair, worn in her signature style: top and sides pulled back into a single barrette at the crown; the rest flows down her back. The style has not changed over the years, but the color has gone from a rich, dark brown to its current salt and pepper. Her lyrical voice retains its colors of yesteryear. Annie Rose, the girl who once aspired to be the choir lady, now inspires others to be like Annie Rose. Temple Beth Emeth is located at 2309 Packard Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 62 While most people have heard of the Chinese medical practice of acupuncture, few recognize that it is only one of four different branches of TCVM, a medical system that has been used to treat animals for thousands of years. A practitioner of TCVM perceives disease as an imbalance in the body and takes into account all of the factors that may have led to that imbalance, including the patient's temperament, age, diet, and environment. The practitioner makes a diagnosis using both the patient's clinical signs and the underlying pattern of disharmony, and then combines four modalities of treatment to help regain balance in the body and restore health. The four branches of TCVM treatment include acupuncture, herbal medication, food therapy, and Tui-na (Chinese medical manipulation). Acupuncture uses the placement of needles to stimulate specific points on the body to help restore harmony and regulate Qi (life energy) flow. Different forms of acupuncture include dry needle, electroacupuncture, aqua-acupuncture, hemo-acupuncture, and moxibustion. The majority of patients enjoy acupuncture and often fall asleep during treatment. Herbal medications are used in specific formulas to treat disease patterns. They are available in powder, pill, or even treat forms, and can also be used topically. The majority of herbal formulas are designed to be used for a three- to six-month treatment period, but the time frame of treatment will vary depending upon your pet's diagnosis. Food therapy can be used to both treat and prevent disease using food energetics. Diets are tailored to fit you and your pet's lifestyle, from small amounts of foods added to your pet's current diet to complete, balanced, home-cooked meals without any commercial pet food. Tui-na , a combination of acupressure, conventional massage, and chiropractic techniques, is used to promote circulation of Qi. Tui-na techniques are often taught to owners during an appointment to use daily at home to extend the healing effects of acupuncture and to deepen their connection with their pet. TCVM treatment has many wonderful benefits: It c an be used to treat almost any condition that may affect your pet, including skin allergies, chronic diarrhea, seizures, behavioral issues, cancer, bladder stones, arthritis, liver disease, asthma, kidney disease, diabetes, and hyper- or hypothyroidism. It has minimal side e ffects. It c an be safely used in conjunction with most medications your pet may be taking and can also help you to decrease or even wean your pet off of certain medications with harmful side effects. It c an be used in exotic species that have few medications available for treatment such as rabbits, reptiles, and birds. The en tire body is taken into consideration during treatment, making it possible to treat multiple medical issues during each session. Katie Emma, a 14-year-old yellow Labrador, was showing signs of weakness in her rear limbs and was referred to my practice for acupuncture treatment. During her initial TCVM exam, her owner mentioned that Katie Emma had been showing signs of anxiety for over five years, including following her owner around constantly while she was in the house and waking up almost every night panting and nervous. Her owner was reluctant to leave home because of Katie's extreme anxiety and had not been able to sleep through the night in many years. Katie was also overweight and had trouble standing for long periods of time. Katie was given a TCVM pattern diagnosis of Yin Deficiency, which occurs when the body has a cold deficiency, and causes panting, anxiety, and sleeplessness. Her treatment plan included electroacupuncture treatment and two herbal formulas for her anxiety, hindquarter weakness, and Yin Deficiency, and Tui-na techniques for her owner to do twice daily at home to help reduce anxiety and support her rear limbs. Additionally, her owner chose to switch her to a home cooked TCVM diet based on food energetics for Yin Deficiency. At Katie's second visit one week later, her owner stated she was amazed at the immediate improvement. She had slept through the night every single day that week, was no longer following her owner around the house, and her panting was almost non-existent. Katie was also standing for longer periods of time and was more comfortable. Over the next few months, Katie continued to improve and lost over 10 pounds on her new diet. Katie's response to treatment illustrates how well TCVM works on multiple medical issues, as well as how it can be used to treat issues for which Western medicine has few treatment options. At my practice, improvement of quality of life in elderly pets is the most common request from owners seeking TCVM treatment for their pet, and TCVM makes working with these patients extremely rewarding. Owners can't wait to tell me how their dog (who spent most days lying around the house because he or she was too sore to move) now greets them at the door every day, or how their cat is using the litter box again because he or she can lift its legs high enough to step inside. Owners are happy to have the option of using TCVM in addition to their current medications or as a sole therapy, and they enjoy being able to participate in their pet's care by using Tui-na or cooking special recipes. TCVM treatment provides a holistic approach to your pet's healthcare, and, while each of the four treatment branches is powerful and can be used individually, combining all aspects of TCVM treatment yields amazing results.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 64 The Crazy Wisdom Kids Section By Sarah Newland, Waldorf parent of two children, ages 8 and 15 Book & Media Reviews - Great Kids Books & DVDs available at Crazy Wisdom in our Children's SectionThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 65 Our children are good! They are inherently generous, sharing, and cooperative. You've probably enjoyed seeing your children share and take turns easily when they are feeling relaxed and connected. You have seen how very sweet and tender they can be. So What's Going on When They Have a Hard Time Sharing?When children have trouble sharing, it's often not really about the item at hand \u2014 the doll, the truck, or whatever it is they feel they need to have \"right now.\" It's also not a flaw in their personality; in fact, it's not their personality at all. There's an emotional tension that underlies problems with sharing. These problems can arise when children haven't been feeling connected or because something has happened to remind them of a time when they felt afraid or alone. I invite you to consider your children's difficult moments with sharing as a signal to you that they need to reconnect with you and possibly offload some stored feelings with a cry or a tantrum. We deeply love our children, but their sense of connection is fragile and often breaks. Sometimes this is because we are busy with the daily demands of feeding and physically caring for our children, not to mention the pressures and worries of work and other aspects of day-to-day living. We know we are there for our children, but sometimes they don't feel it. Sometimes it takes slowing down and being physically close and attentive \u2014 with eye contact, a warm tone of voice, and other non-verbal signals \u2014 for our children to regain their sense of connection. Children who are feeling alone or scared can't be flexible or respond to our verbal communication until they feel reassured and reconnected by our nonverbal cues. Once the connection is re-established, they may then feel safe enough to release their feelings with a cry or tantrum. All parents have to handle difficult moments around sharing. So how do we help our children in these moments of difficulty? Here are two policies that you may want to introduce with your children and in your playgroups. These policies involve setting limits first and then following up with listening. Steps for Handling a \"Sharing Emergency\" Fir st, don't enforce turns right away unless there are safety concerns with the number of children. If a child is playing with a toy, then he can have it until he is done playing with it. Sec ond, offer to stay with the other child while she waits, then stay close and listen to what comes up for her.If you think of a child's difficulty with sharing as a signal that she is feeling alone or scared, then you can see how enforcing turns with time limits or making one child \"be nice\" and share unwillingly doesn't address the underlying need. If other children will be safe while you pay attention to the child having the difficulty, one strategy that works very well is to say to the child, with kindness and warmth, \"So-and-so is playing with that toy now, but I will stay with you while you wait. When so-and-so is finished, then you can have a turn.\" Often this is enough for the child to begin to cry or tantrum. If you can stay close and be warm and encouraging while the child cries or tantrums, she will offload whatever the feelings are that are making her tense. This can be challenging for us as parents, but when we are able to do this, we can see the difference it makes for our children. When Both Children Are Having a Hard Time Sharing Sometimes, when more than one child is feeling disconnected and tense, there will be a longer, mutually tense battle over a toy. In this case, the child who has the toy and is allowed to play with it for as long as he likes plays with it rigidly (and usually without enjoyment) and protects it so that he doesn't have to share with the child who is waiting. In this case, you can plan for a more long-term fairness. Say that tomorrow, or after lunch, or whenever the next time is, the child who is waiting will have the first turn (sometimes it continues to center around the same toy but may shift to something else, like who goes first on the swings) and you will be with the other child while he waits. This is a lot of listening, but it may be what your children need. When You Arrive on the Scene of Full Blown Conflict When the conflict over a toy is already full blown by the time you can get there, try putting your hand on the toy so that neither child can pull it away. Offer to listen to them and encourage them to figure out what to do. They may both have some big feelings! But as those feelings dissipate, so will the tension, and, if you can stay calm and listen, you may be surprised by the solution they come up with on their own. Who Will Listen to You? Having a chance for someone to listen to you is important because of all the listening you do with your children. The approach that I teach includes setting up listening partnerships with other parents. During a listening exchange, you get to speak about your challenges and successes as a parent without interruption or advice. You can examine what it's like for you to listen to your child when she is upset. Did anyone ever do that for you? What was it like for you when you had to share as a child? What is it like now? Having a chance to talk about all of this to a warm and caring listener and then in turn listening to him or her can make it possible to go back and listen more and better to our children.

For more info, be in touch with bill@crazywisdom.netThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 66 By Karen Foulke Larson Zoos provide opportunities to see unique animals, but where can children and adults go to touch exotic animals and ask questions about them? The Creature Conservancy, an Ann Arbor-based nonprofit organization, provides that type of hands-on learning experience for children and adults. The Creature Conservancy is located on Ann Arbor-Saline Road in the Copper Leaf Crossing Complex. Visitors driving by may stop to walk around the grounds, intrigued by the animals that are visible behind fences. They can see the fuzzy white Arctic fox, the colorful peacocks, and the barking deer. However, the majority of the animals, and arguably the most interesting ones, cannot be seen by an impromptu visit. Most of the habitats can only be viewed at special events. Other animals' visibility is dependent on the season and/or the time of day, since most of the animals are brought indoors at nighttime. If visitors attend an event at The Creature Conservancy, what awaits them is much more than just seeing animals behind fences. In the education center, audiences can view the animals up close and, in some cases, even touch them. It is a memorable experience for visitors of all ages and a chance to ask questions and learn about how animals live in the wild. The Creation of The Creature Conservancy In 2005, a ten-pound alligator was left in a crate at the doorstep of the Animal Kingdom Veterinary Hospital. No explanation was given, but the staff speculated that the alligator was getting too large, too aggressive, and/or too expensive for his owner to keep. At the time, there were few options for a homeless alligator. Zoological societies received animals frequently that owners regretted having as pets. Because Al was not afraid of humans and associated them with food, releasing him in a swamp would have been a potentially dangerous mistake. Steve Marsh and his wife, Dr. Vicki Daldin Marsh, own Copper Leaf Crossing, a 23- acre complex which houses the Animal Kingdom Veterinary Hospital, a medical facility specializing in exotic animals, as well as groomers, a boarding facility, and a dog park. The Marshs decided to give Al a home, and his arrival eventually led to the creation of The Creature Conservancy, which now occupies approximately 17 of the acres. Soon Al was joined by a sloth rescued from a trailer park, a macaw whose owner never returned to pick him up from a boarding facility, ball pythons found in a dumpster, and iguanas found loose on the University of Michigan campus. \"It is easy to buy exotic animals online,\" said Steve Marsh, the head curator of The Creature Conservancy. He said that exotic animals often just get recycled in the pet market. Kim Ellis, Vice President of The Creature Conservancy and Mammal Curator, said, \"People feel like they can tame an animal if they get it as a baby.\" Of course, that isn't the case. You can't change the nature of an animal. One owner didn't realize the many reasons that a fox is not meant to be a pet, and a fluffy white Arctic fox named Burton came to live at The Creature Conservancy once his owner realized his mistake. Marsh cautions that you have to \"be careful about being too judgmental\" about the pet owners who decided to purchase wild animals. He said everyone needs to think long and hard about all the factors involved in pet ownership before getting any type of pet. Each creature has an interesting story of how it found its home at the Conservancy. The macaws were all previously pets. Owners relocated them for a variety of reasons \u2014 economic rescue, divorce, and a relative moving in who didn't like their noise. Life span is another factor that people often forget to include in their decision-making. Macaws may live 25 years, and a tiny little tortoise can grow up to be quite large and live 40 to 50 years. Most of the animals are rescues, but The Creature Conservancy has acquired some animals to meet teaching goals. For example, giant toads and legless lizards are teaching tools for learning about the disruption of the ecological balance. The Creature Conservancy also has exchanged animals with The Columbus Zoo. Two polecats are the newest additions from the zoo. The Creature Conservancy's setting has some advantages for presenting animals, like a defined space, a constant setting, and the ability to have an animal in front of an audience for a short amount of time. Commitment to Education Even before The Creature Conservancy was started, Marsh used his work at Copper Leaf Crossing to educate the public. The nonprofit's mission is \"to work within our community to create personal connections between people, animals, and their shared environment. By bringing humans and animals together in educational settings, we hope to cultivate a greater appreciation for the animals with which we share this planet.\" In addition to educational events and tours, The Creature Conservancy hosts birthday parties as fundraisers. The birthday guests can choose from a long list of animal party guests. Ellis points out that people often choose the kangaroo or a sloth, but they may be even more fascinated by the opossum or a reptile and their roles in the ecosystem. Making a connection with animals helps people increase their awareness of conservation. Marsh said that, after meeting Pete the skunk, he hopes visitors will think differently the next time they see a skunk in the wild.Animal Educators The Creature Conservancy Provides a Home for Animals and Educational Opportunities for the Community If visitors attend an event at The Creature Conservancy, what awaits them is much more than just seeing animals behind fences.

He enthusiastically takes questions and leaves his audiences with a new appreciation for the animals he introduces. Home Sweet Home So what does it take to feed and care for such a diverse group of species? A tremendous amount of food and hundreds of volunteers ensure the animals thrive. The organization is always grateful for monetary donations, food donations, and items from their wish list, which includes food, toys, cleaning supplies, and more. It takes approximately 120 to 150 pounds of food per day to feed all the animals. That's an average of sixty individual meals per day (factoring in reptiles who eat less frequently, and about fifty meals per day just for the mammals and birds).

That donation is a huge help, especially since it is the only food donation that is received on a regular basis. The Creature Conservancy purchases about eighty to one hundred pounds of produce per week, as well as all the dry feed for animals like turkeys, emu, and swans, plus pellets for kangaroos/wallabies and supplemental grain for the deer. Often, special events at the education center include a request for visitors to bring food for the animals to help with this enormous expense. As a nonprofit without any paid staff, it would be impossible to keep a program of this scale open without dedicated supporters and volunteers. Animal Kingdom Veterinary Hospital, where Daldin Marsh is one of the veterinarians, donates the building space, utilities, and veterinary services, and many staff members volunteer their time on their days off from work. Steve Marsh and Kim Ellis are responsible for the most volunteer hours with their efforts seven days a week. Both are modest about their roles and instead prefer to talk about the team effort. Ellis, who also serves as the volunteer coordinator, praised the volunteers and their roles. The number of volunteer hours a week can easily reach 250, with approximately 100 hours of that time devoted to preparing food and feeding the animals. Volunteers come from a variety of lifestyles, including college students, professionals, and retirees who all share a love for taking care of animals. Marsh and Ellis have long lists of duties and are dedicated to the care of the animals, but neither of them are satisfied with just maintaining what already exists. They both work hard to improve the habitats for the animals and the educational experiences of the visitors. Growing Into a New Space One of those improvements was a new indoor habitat for Al, the alligator brought to Animal Kingdom in a crate. He has grown since his arrival on the doorstep eight years ago and is now fifty pounds and five feet five inches. His new home is a beautiful space designed by Marsh, with a pond dug by Eagle Scouts. The walls are built from one-hundred-year-old recycled stall wood, and Marsh hammered each board in place himself. A boardwalk provides a space for Marsh to present information to people visiting Al. Rain water fed from a steel roof flows into his 3,000-gallon pond. Al loves his new home, which he moved into March 2013, giving him ample room to swim for the first time. He even started behaviors that were new for him like vocalizing. The kangaroos, Tulip and Maybelline, also moved into their new enclosure in April 2013, and Marsh has plans to add viewing areas. Camps at The Creature Conservancy The Creature Conservancy offers week-long summer day camps for kids with opportunities for hands-on experience with exotic animals and science-based learning. Animal adaptations, social behavior, habitats, and conservation are part of a curriculum that is enhanced by visits with more than fifty different species of \"animal educators.\" Five-year-old Jacob Carbone attended the half-day camp for kindergarteners last July. He loved it so much that he told his mom he wants to go back this summer for a two-week camp. His mom Debbie said, \"I was very pleased that the camp not only taught the children about animals but they also incorporated games and art projects into the daily activities. The children were involved in many aspects of the camp, ranging from preparing the foods to feeding the animals to learning about their habitats and characteristics.\" Creature Conservancy Continued from page 67 \"I'll never forget the time Steve arrived for a library program for children with his newly adopted young kangaroo named Tulip. The care and tenderness he showed her, along with the knowledge he had, was so impressive and touching.

The birthday guests can choose from a long list of animal party guests.Life span is another factor that people often forget to include in their decision-making. Macaws may live 25 years, and a tiny little tortoise can grow up to be quite large and live 40 to 50 years.

Steve Marsh, Head Curator and President of The Creature Conservancy, introduces an audience to Tulip, a red kangaroo, who is one of the \"animal educators\" at the nonprofit.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 69 Julie Gales' daughters, Emma and Sophie, both loved camp. Gales said, \"Our four- year-old attended a half-day camp last summer and came home bubbling with excitement each day. She loved Abner the emu, Tulip the kangaroo, and the two wolf pups. Her favorite time of the day was watching the animals get fed! I really loved how engaged she was from the minute she arrived until we picked her up at the end of each day.\" Gales' family has had many positive experiences with The Creature Conservancy. She said, \"We have gone there for adult birthday parties and for Girl Scout field trips. It is always fun to see the animals and learn something about their habitat and their ecological needs.\" Some schools have started choosing field trips to The Creature Conservancy instead of trips to area zoos. Ellis said that's because visits include \"an opportunity to see it, hear it, touch it, and ask questions.\" The first grade of Woodland Meadows Elementary in Saline has visited The Creature Conservancy for field trips for the last four years. First grade teacher Betsy Marl said, \"Going to The Creature Conservancy is an amazing field trip right in our own community. As we get off the bus, we are often greeted by animals strolling around the grounds. The children have a rare opportunity to meet, touch, and learn about many exotic animals. Steve and countless volunteers do a wonderful educational presentation stressing the animals' habitat, homes, diet, and the extensive care that many of them require. It's a field trip that will long be remembered by our first graders.\" She added, \"The changes that have taken place at the Conservancy each year have been phenomenal. Each year gets better and better and we meet more new animals.\" The Creature Conservancy hosts several annual fundraisers, including a \"Spooky Species\" event that features classic Halloween animals like owls, ravens, and bats. On Valentine's Day there is a Creature Courtship event for adults that provides interesting facts about animal courtship and procreation. Many Creature Conservancy events have a suggested age for attendees, keeping in mind the attention span of the audience and the need for audiences to remain calm and quiet so that animals aren't startled. Until recently, there hadn't been opportunities for preschoolers, but The Creature Conservancy is trying a new weekly program especially for children ages two to five and their parents. Ellis said that the children's interest in animals often motivates parents to learn more, and in some cases the kids are the educators. She recalled a conversation where a parent considered getting a turtle, and the young daughter countered, \"Mom, that is a wild animal that lives for fifty years.\"The Creature Conservancy offers week-long summer day camps for kids with opportunities for hands-on experience with exotic animals and science-based learning. Some schools have started choosing field trips to The Creature Conservancy instead of trips to area zoos. Ellis said that's because visits include \"an opportunity to see it, hear it, touch it, and ask questions.\"Traveling Guests It is possible to meet some of the Conservancy's animals without going to their education center. The Creature Conservancy is a regular guest at The Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum's Creature Feature fundraiser every October. Last year they brought 90 animals representing 28 species to the event! They also introduced people to over 300 Hissing Cockroaches. The Creature Conservancy also does presentations for libraries, school groups, and companies by bringing animals to off-site locations. Marsh and the animals are often guests at The Ann Arbor District Library, with some programs for a younger audience and other events strictly for teens and adults. Laura Pershin Raynor, Youth and Adult Services Librarian, Ann Arbor District Library, said, \"I'll never forget the time Steve arrived for a library program for children with his newly adopted young kangaroo named Tulip. The care and tenderness he showed her, along with the knowledge he had, was so impressive and touching. The Creature Conservancy serves as an excellent model for teaching respect of the natural world and all its fascinating creatures.\" The library also hosts events specifically for teens and adults where they bring animals that can't normally handle larger, loud crowds of children. Erin Helmrich, Teen and I.T. Production Librarian, said, \"The special programs that The Creature Conservancy offer for the teens and adults at the library are spectacular! ...Steve is able to share tremendous amounts of detailed and fascinating animal information and offer a more intimate, and at times, hands-on experience.\" Whatever the venue, the audience soon learns that these extraordinary animals that were once in need of permanent homes are more than tenants at The Creature Conservancy. They are educators teaching children and adults how to make informed decisions about choosing a pet and ambassadors bringing humans, animals, and nature together. The Creature Conservancy is located at Copper Leaf Crossing, 4940 Ann Arbor-Saline Road, in Ann Arbor. The campus is open for self-guided walking tours as well as scheduled, docent-led tours 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, and 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on Saturdays.

The deadline for submissions for the September 2014 issue is July 1, 2014. By Nieka Apell People familiar with the Humane Society of Huron Valley (HSHV) know about their award-winning success in placing homeless animals and reuniting lost pets with their families. What some may not be aware of are the numerous children's programs and activities \u2014 including tours, field trips, and volunteering opportunities \u2014 coordinated by Karen Patterson, Director of HSHV's Department of Humane Education. Patterson had worked as an elementary school teacher for about ten years when she began to feel it was time to change paths. \"I have always enjoyed working with children, and I have always had a strong passion for animals and animal welfare,\" she explained. \"I felt a need to do something different. One day I did a Google search for careers for people with interests like mine. I found information on veterinary science and animal behavior and I knew those didn't quite fit.\" Then Patterson landed on the website for the Humane Education Program through Valparaiso University. \"It was the perfect fit,\" she said. \"It combined my teaching background and my desire to work with children with my desire to help animals.\" Patterson completed her master's of humane education in 2008. At the same time, Patterson had started volunteering at HSHV. \"I noticed they didn't have a Humane Education Department and I really saw a need for it. There were tours and people very interested in humane education, but not a staff or organized program,\" she said. Patterson began talking with HSHV Board members about the possibility of creating one. In 2011, the Board approved the department, and Patterson became its director. With the help of part-time staff person Alex Ball and numerous volunteers, Patterson coordinates a wide range of increasingly popular programs for young children, youth, and families. \"The response from the community has been overwhelmingly supportive,\" said Patterson. \"It's clear now that there was a strong need and desire for this. Every program we offer sells out \u2014 some within just hours! But that's a good problem to have.\" Although the range of programs is diverse, a common goal is simply to bring new people into the shelter. Patterson explained, \"Many people have a mental image of shelters as depressing, cement buildings full of sad, lonely animals. When people come here, they are pleasantly surprised by what they find,\" she said, adding that HSHV opened their new facility in late 2009. For example, Patterson said that when children and their parents come to HSHV for a birthday party, they are impressed with the animals' standard of care and comfort. Birthday parties include a shelter tour and education about the shelter and its programs, a craft project, such as a dog bandana or cat toy that children can leave with the animals, an interaction with one or more shelter animals, and the opportunity to choose a name for an adoptable animal. Patterson said that reviews of the parties have been universally positive. \"Not only do kids love the parties, but our costs are often lower than other party venues and many people feel good about giving their money to a nonprofit rather than a traditional party place,\" she said. Increasing numbers of children in the Boy and Girl Scouts have taken advantage of HSHV's field trip program, which is geared toward helping the scouts earn patches and badges. Patterson said that scouts often collect donations as part of a service project; these children are then featured on the shelter's \"Kind Kids' Corner\" webpage, which highlights children who provide goods and services to the shelter. Scouting field trips last for about two hours and also include education, a shelter tour, a craft for the animals, and interaction with adoptable dogs and cats. Tours and field trips are also designed for homeschool groups and school classrooms for grades Kindergarten through eight. In addition, HSHV will bring an animal educator to school classrooms or groups to present on topics such as basic animal care, choosing a pet, and animal welfare. \"We can tailor presentations for the age of the children and for their interests,\" said Patterson. \"We can help the field trips and presentations fit the Michigan curriculum and the teacher's needs.\" Other programs for younger children include the monthly \"Little Paws\" storytime at Nicola's Books. Designed for children ages 3 to 5, the storytime includes an animal-themed story, craft, and a visit from an adoptable animal. Patterson said that pre-registration is not required for these free storytimes, which take place at 11 a.m. on the third Saturday of each month. Pre-registration is required for the very popular \"Pets and Pajamas\" movie nights held monthly at the Humane Society. Children ages 5 to 11 are invited to wear pajamas and bring their sleeping bags, pillows, and stuffed friends to enjoy animal-themed fun from 5:00 to 9:00 p.m. Humane Society staff and volunteers share information about the shelter and guide children as they interact with adoptable animals. \"It's a really special time,\" explained Patterson. \"The children go to visit the animals, wish them good night, and help us turn out the lights. It's very sweet.\" Once the animals are tucked in, children enjoy a vegetarian dinner and an animal-themed movie. The next Pets and Pajamas movie night will feature The Lorax on Friday, May 16. \"This is a great way for children to learn a bit about our shelter and about animals and also for parents to get a night out, knowing their kids are safe and having a great time.\" The cost of Pets and Pajamas is $35 for the first child and $15 for each additional child in the family. Finally, for kids ages 4 to 11, there is Camp Paws, week-long half- and full-day summer camps held at the Humane Society. Camps are held from June through August and are filled with animal-themed activities and field trips. Highlights of a camp week might include visits with Great Lakes Zoological Society, Feral Foods C.S.A. (Community Supported Agriculture), and area wildlife rescue groups, such as Home Again Avian Rescue, the Detroit Zoological Society, and The Creature Conservancy. All sessions include information on caring for and respecting all animals. Patterson noted that this summer features a new two-hour camp day option for the youngest 4- and 5-year-old campers. Registration is open on the HSHV website and limited scholarships are available.

It's very sweet.\" -Karen Patterson on HSHV's \"Pets and Pajamas\" theme nightsPatterson explained that for all these programs aimed at preschool and elementary- aged children, the goal is to educate about animals without taking a heavy-handed approach. \"We are trying to build empathy and compassion from an early age. We know that when kids interact with animals from a young age, they learn the humane treatment not only of animals, but of people, as well,\" she explained. She emphasized that animal cruelty is also a serious problem for people. \"It affects people, especially if children witness it from an early age. The more we can educate people about the treatment of animals \u2014 and of each other \u2014 the better. These are the things that keep me going!\" One of the most popular programs at the HSHV is the Junior Volunteers (JVs). This program is for children ages 12 to 17 who want to volunteer independently at the shelter and with off-site programs. Students who enroll in the JVs must complete six, two-hour training sessions on topics including basic animal care, animal welfare, and animal training and handling. Once students have completed the training, they are eligible to work as shelter volunteers, walking dogs and comforting cats and helping at area events, such as Top of the Park and Art Fair. \"This is a really unique program for our area and even across the country,\" said Patterson. \"This is an age group with a huge need for meaningful volunteer opportunities. It remains our most popular program and sells out within ten minutes of our posting enrollment on our website every time.\" Patterson said that they open a new class for 35 enrollees every six weeks. \"We have talked about expanding this program, but for now, we've decided we want to keep it small,\" she explained. \"We want to maintain the intimacy. With a group of this size, I know everyone, and if we expanded it, I'd lose that connection.\" Patterson added that the JVs also learn about other animal rights topics, including information related to zoos, aquariums, circuses, and factory farms. \"We always keep information age appropriate,\" emphasized Patterson. \"We want to provide a gentle awakening to these issues. Our goal is just to introduce relevant topics.\" Patterson said that she notices a lot of growth in the JVs as they train and volunteer. \"I've seen youth who are very quiet who come here and make real connections with peers who share similar interests. They gain so much confidence,\" she said. The HSHV also has a partnership with the Washtenaw County Juvenile Detention and Day Treatment Center. The program, which started last October with a grant from the James A. and Faith Knight Foundation, brings youth from the facility to visit HSHV every other week to help comfort the animals and provide enrichment activities for them. The youth The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 71 Continued on page 72 \"We are trying to build empathy and compassion from an early age.\" -Karen Patterson learn about proper care of animals, positive training for dogs (rather than punishment-based), and building outdoor shelters for animals. \"For many of these kids, their week's behavioral goal may be to earn the privilege to come here. When they get here, they proudly tell us, 'We made it!'\" Patterson and Ball also make weekly visits to the facility to present on topics such as pet safety, animal communication, and dog cruelty. Patterson emphasized that the central message of all the Humane Education programs is both simple and profound. \"Our message is that our daily choices make a real difference in the lives of people and of animals. We want to give lots of positive choices and opportunities to help animals,\" she said. \"One of the most important messages we want to share, especially with children, is that it is absolutely okay to love animals. You are not alone if you love animals and you can come here to find others like you.\" To get additional information about HSHV's Humane Education programs and activities or to register, visit their website at www.hshv.org under the \"Programs\" tab or call HSHV at (734) 662-5585.

Recently, however, she felt guided to combine her passion for art with her love of children and founded Dreamscapes Art Studio in Ypsilanti. \"I started asking myself 'What am I doing in my life that is meaningful, that matters, that I can share with others?' I realized that I'm not like everybody else. I have this passion for art and for guiding and nurturing children as they discover their artistic process,\" Winn said. Dreamscapes, which had its grand opening March 1, offers private and small-group art lessons for children ages four to fifteen. Winn, 31, was born into a creative family. Her brother and his partner own BootsNGus, a company that creates upcycled lighting from mason jars, and her sister sells vintage dresses. \"I knew that founding an art studio \u2014 especially one that's different from what people are used to \u2014 would be difficult, and this has been one of the hardest things I have ever done. I realized that if my little brother can follow his passion, I can be brave and follow my own dreams. I have to be true to myself and follow this passion now,\" said Winn, who has an associate's degree in early childhood education from Washtenaw Community College and is in her final semester of a bachelor's degree in fine arts from Eastern Michigan University. She explained that two of her courses at Eastern helped turn her ideas about founding a children's art studio into reality. \"I took 'Drama and Play and the Human Experience' and a ceramics class and suddenly I realized how much it means to me to have art in my life and to incorporate play and art into the lives of others,\" she said.Winn acknowledges that her approach to guiding children in their artistic explorations is different from what many parents would expect when enrolling their children in art classes. The main difference, she explained, is that her students focus on the process of making art, rather than on the product. \"So often, kids will attend an art class or a workshop and they start by seeing an example of the project they are supposed to do, and then every child uses the same materials to make that project. The colors used might be different, but the project is basically the same,\" she said. \"At Dreamscapes, there aren't going to be specific projects. We'll learn together about techniques and media and basic elements of art and then we'll let the children work on their own ideas.\" Winn admits that parents used to a more traditional art class might initially feel confused or even disappointed at the art their children bring home. \"I reassure them that the process is more important \u2014 Dolores Winn felt guided to combine her passion for art with her love of children and founded Dreamscapes Art Studio in Ypsilanti.\" At Dreamscapes, there aren't going to be specific projects. We'll learn together about techniques and media and basic elements of art and then we'll let the children work on their own ideas.\" -Dolores Winn, owner of Dreamscapes Art StudioPhotos for Dreamscapes by Julie Morrison Dolores WinnThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 73 Continued on page 74especially at first \u2014 than the product. I need parents to know that when they see those first pieces come home, they shouldn't feel disappointed or sad,\" she said. \"Experimenting with different media is just the first step in a wonderful process!\" A student's first lessons will combine experimentation and play with learning about the basic elements of art, including the color wheel and line. For example, a very early class might include \"tall painting,\" an exercise in which children splash and pour different colored paints from a height onto a wooden canvas in order to observe color mixing and to start a discussion about primary and secondary colors. Winn explained that her inspiration for this lesson came from her observations of a more traditional children's art class. \"The teacher gave the students their paints and the kids were just fascinated with mixing the colors and playing with them, but the teacher kept telling them not to mix up their paints, that they were making a mess, that they would wreck everything and end up with mud. That bothered me and I want to do something different,\" she said. Other early classes start with observational drawing, while encouraging children to move and use their bodies as they draw. \"The sketching is not just simple, realistic line drawing, although that will become more of a focus later on. I want kids to enjoy moving their bodies with the pencil. I want to incorporate exercises that show them that they can draw, that they can record their ideas, their dreams, their visions of the world in a way that allows them to show them to others.\" Expanding on this philosophy, she added, \"There is no one way, no right way to draw something. If you tell a child there is one way and they don't see it that way or can't draw it that way, then you risk killing their spirit.\" A passion for nature and the outdoors inspires many of Winn's lessons. \"We'll bring in real insects for children to observe or we may do a flower study,\" she said. During the spring and summer, projects such as birdhouses and materials such as stones, twigs, and branches will encourage young artists to honor the earth. As children gain confidence in their drawing, Winn's lessons will expand to include more abstract ideas such as maps of favorite places, maps of their cities, cityscapes of imagined cities, and even maps or representations of their dreams. At the same time, children will be given the opportunity to work with different artistic media, including collage, clay, and sculpture. Winn added that using quality tools and materials is very important to her. \"We'll introduce different types of paint, pencils, and brushes and talk about how they affect texture and different effects. This is not going to be a place where kids only use washable paints and foam stickers. I want kids to have the opportunity to create with real materials that are more adaptable,\" she said. In order to maintain a very individualized approach to art education, Winn said that her classes will remain very small, with a maximum of five students. She said that the small class size is essential to her approach. \"For me, each child coming here is the curriculum. I want to focus on the thought process and interests of each individual and meet them where they are,\" she explained. Winn incorporates some of the Reggio Emilia Approach in her teaching, which is a philosophy that encourages educators of young children to act as both guides and fellow learners. The method promotes multi-sensory learning with touching, moving, listening, seeing, hearing, and questioning from the teachers and the learners. \"Children need to feel some control over their learning process,\" said Winn. \"It's also really important for them to build relationships with the other children in the class and with their teachers.\" Winn wants classes to be child-directed, where the teacher is a partner in their learning. \"I want this to be their own dreams coming to life. There's a reason I've called my studio 'Dreamscapes.' I want to ask each student, 'What are your dreams?' and then I can help them explore and represent those dreams in order to record them and to make them visible to others,\" Winn said. In addition to creating artwork, her students will learn to talk with others about their pieces. Each child will manage their own art portfolio, choosing which works to include. Students will be given time to share works with others, talking about their choices of technique, methods, and messages. \"After taking these classes, a student could have a really well-developed portfolio,\" said Winn. \"They'll also have a great foundation for talking with others about their artistic processes.\" Winn currently holds classes on weekends at her Ypsilanti studio. She plans to expand her offerings to include weekday summer classes and \"Mommy and Me\" and \"Daddy and Me\" classes. Her goal is to have a full-time children's art studio. The cost per two-hour class is $40. Winn said that while this costs more than a traditional larger-group art class, it is comparable to a private or semi-private music class. She is working to find scholarship support for students in need. Winn said that she has been encouraged by the overwhelmingly positive support she has received from the community. \"I feel as if this is a small seed I am planting and the response I've gotten shows that it's very wanted,\" explained Winn. \"I want to create a small, sacred space where every child can feel comfortable expressing themselves. Art is my way to help children on this journey.\" Dreamscapes Art Studio is located at 2048 Washtenaw Road, Suite 3, Ypsilanti, Michigan 48197.

Call for information about our Summer camps! Spring/Summer session April 14-July 19th ($25 value) The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 74 Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community Continued from page 73 Helping children grow into their best possible selves is certainly a fulfilling and rewarding experience for educators and parents. At the same time, working closely with children \u2014 especially those with special needs \u2014 can be very stressful. School psychologist and parent Mary Spence is uniquely aware of the stressors faced by today's teachers and parents. To help them cultivate skills for handling these inevitable pressures, Spence and several colleagues have recently founded The Michigan Collaborative for Mindfulness in Education (MC4ME), a nonprofit, professional network of Michigan educators who strive to share the benefits of mindfulness for students, families, and educators. At its core, mindfulness, according to Spence, is \"the idea of being fully present in this moment, giving your full attention to what you are doing.\" In addition, it incorporates an attitude of non-judgment. She explained, \"Mindfulness requires having undying curiosity for what's happening in that moment, both within yourself, within your own body and mind, and within the situation around you.\" Spence's interest in mindfulness comes from her own life experiences both as an educator and a parent. Currently in her eighth year as a school psychologist in the Ann Arbor Public School District, Spence has a Ph.D. in psychology and a background working in corrections. For many years, she worked with children with significant disabilities through the Washtenaw Intermediate School District (WISD). In addition, Spence said she herself has a child with a disability. \"I feel like I have a unique perspective on the stresses and issues associated with working in special education,\" said Spence. \"I have worked in the interface between teachers, parents, students, and psychologists and I have been that parent myself. I'm certainly not here to be critical of the Ann Arbor Schools or of the public schools at all. What I know is that being a parent of and a professional working with children with special needs is really, really stressful.\" She said a main goal of the mindfulness curriculum is \"to create a culture and atmosphere within schools that is less stressful for the kids to learn in and less stressful for the educators to teach in. When things get too stressful, synapses stop firing and no one functions well.\" Spence explained that the stress and anxiety faced by students, parents, and educators alike comes from a variety of factors that can be mediated by mindfulness training. \"No matter how skilled an educator is, there are limitations on our own ability to help with the suffering we see around us. For educators and parents working with kids with disabilities, that suffering can be profound,\" she said. \"It is absolutely not a coincidence that the divorce rate is so much higher in families with children with special needs.\" Daily life can also be overwhelmingly stressful for a child with special needs. Spence said: Much of their day is hard for them. For some, their parents and their teachers try hard to make life easier for them. When you have a child with a disability, it can be natural to try to make life easier, to smooth things over for them. But what can happen is that these kids learn limited skills for handling frustrations, and their lives are certainly full of frustrations. Mindfulness training can help them pause, reflect, and think about how they are feeling before things spiral out of control. When people find themselves becoming frustrated, they often assume either that they have done something wrong or that someone else is doing something wrong. \"Our initial approach is often judgmental,\" she said. \"A mindfulness approach would encourage one to have a non-judgmental curiosity about what's happening to me in that situation. One can ask, 'How do I want to look at this to be of most benefit to this situation?' It also encourages being compassionate to yourself and to others and having a generous heart.\" Although the concept of mindfulness in education may be new to some, Spence said that the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program, one of several mindfulness curricula offered by MC4ME, was developed more than thirty years ago by MIT-educated scientist Jon Kabat-Zinn, whose interest in mindfulness began as a way to help patients manage chronic pain and the anxiety associated with it. Kabat-Zinn found that meditation and mindfulness training helped patients cope with that pain. In the years since, researchers have found that mindfulness training can help lower stress hormones and blood pressure and other measurable indicators of stress. \"This is empirical. It's evidence-based,\" said Spence. Spence recently served as the training liaison for a study that assessed the effectiveness of a five-week mindfulness training program for parents and educators of children with special needs. The study showed that stress and anxiety were reduced and compassion increased in the mindfulness training participants when compared with the control group. \"This research is exciting because it shows empirically what participants tell us,\" said Spence. \"Once people begin the training, they often say, 'Why would we resist doing this? This feels so good!'\" she said. Spence added that while some aspects of mindfulness training, such as those related to meditation, may have similarities to the Buddhist tradition, mindfulness training and the programs offered by MC4ME are entirely secular. Spence said that she's often asked about the difference between mindfulness training and the numerous other \"stress reduction\" programs and techniques that have become commonplace. She explained that most stress reduction techniques and traditional therapies are \"top down\" approaches. \"These approaches start at our language base, at our executive functions, our cognitive processes,\" said Spence. \"Then they assume that this will help our bodies and our emotions and will make us feel better. It's like assuming that one can control one's frame of mine enough \u2014 in the moment \u2014 to help with math frustration or to handle a conflict with a student. A top down approach puts attention on trying to solve a problem, rather than on first acknowledging what's happening within one's own person,\" she said. Mindfulness is different, according to Spence, because it's a \"bottom up\" approach. \"It starts with recognizing how one's own body is feeling, controlling one's own breathing, then focusing on one's own emotions in a non-judgmental way,\" she explained. \"Everybody has the ability to go within. It really works because it's so natural.\" She added that focusing on one's body first can be especially useful for children with special needs, especially those who have limited verbal skills, since they can learn to feel and monitor their breath, a first step in calming and reducing stress. \"We can use mindfulness training to remind children that when they find themselves in stressful situations \u2014 a conflict with someone or even a hard math exercise \u2014 they can take that pause to get their breath, to think about how they feel, and then realize that they can do hard things.\" Mindfulness training has also proven useful in mediating the sometimes stressful transition Michigan Collaborative for Mindfulness in Education (MC4ME) MC4ME is a nonprofit, professional network of Michigan educators who strive to share the benefits of mindfulness for students, families, and educators. \"I have worked in the interface between teachers, parents, students, and psychologists and I have been that parent myself.\" - Psychologist and MC4ME founder Mary Spence\"When things get too stressful, synapses stop firing and no one functions well.\" - Mary Spence Kristin Ervin facilitates a mindfulness lesson at Berkshire Middle School.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 75 between middle and high school. Spence said research shows that students who do not successfully manage this transition are at much greater risk of dropping out during high school. For parents and educators, this approach is also useful. \"It's about being mindful of your own emotions, taking those few seconds to notice one's own emotions before formulating a response,\" said Spence. \"We have to start with our own emotions so that we can take care of ourselves first. Teachers are so fragmented, pulled in so many directions at once. Our own well being is essential to being able to effectively help others.\" \"Mindfulness inherently encourages ways of being that are not divisive,\" she added, which can be a major benefit for educators who find themselves in frequent competition for scare resources such as time and money. \"In our schools, we are constantly competing for limited resources. People's philosophical perspectives are different, and we are constantly feeling a need to defend ourselves and our positions.\" Spence described a concept she calls \"parallel truths,\" two equally valid ideas or points of view that will never intersect. \"Neither idea is more or less 'right.' They are simply different. A mindfulness approach both helps one consider the other's perspectives in curious, non-judging ways, but also helps each person pause to consider her or his own reactions without just jumping to defensiveness, which is our first instinct,\" she said. \"We can take that momentary pause to check in with ourselves before defensiveness and that can make so much difference.\" The Michigan Collaborative for Mindfulness in Education is comprised of professionals with a range of backgrounds who want to share information and mindfulness training. Members of the board of directors have training in and can present on a variety of approaches to mindfulness, including SMART (Stress Management and Relaxation Techniques), Mindful Schools, MindUP , .b (pronounced \"dot-be,\" which stands for \"Stop, Breathe, and Be!\"), and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction. Spence said that the current goals of the organization are \"to find and advocate for people and organizations who want to learn more about and participate in this kind of mindfulness training,\" adding that they hope to find sources of funding for those who might not be able to afford it otherwise. Introductory talks about mindfulness, as well as more in-depth trainings, may be scheduled by contacting MC4ME. In addition, MC4ME holds public events such as the recent showing of the documentary Room to Breathe , an exploration of the transformations after mindfulness training in a struggling San Francisco middle school. Spence said that she looks forward to sharing mindfulness training and its benefits with the Ann Arbor area. \"People are thirsty for this,\" she said. \"This kind of work is not fluff. It's not an extra. It is fundamental to how we can best learn and that is something that reaches me on an emotional level.\" For more information about MC4ME and mindfulness training, visit www.mc4me.org or contact Mary Spence at mary.spence@me.com. \"We have to start with our own emotions so that we can take care of ourselves first. Teachers are so fragmented, pulled in so many directions at once. Our own well being is essential to being able to effectively help others.\" -Mary Spence\"When you have a child with a disability , it can be natural to try to make life easier, to smooth things over for them. But what can happen is that these kids learn limited skills for handling frustrations... Mindfulness training can help them pause, reflect, and think about how they are feeling before things spiral out of control.\" -Mary Spence Kristin Ervin uses a \"mind jar\" to demonstrate how mindfulness works to calm a busy mind. 3022 Packard Rd, Ann Arbor MI 48108 211 W.

The struggle is as old as mankind. Dr. Randolph Stone, Founder of Polarity Therapy . Approved NCBTMB continuing education provider. Visit polaritycenter.com.for summer workshops and fall classes. (313) 647-0038A healing and learning community in southeast Michigan for more than 25 years DISCOVER YOURSELF What if... Your gut instincts are right You can balance your energy Your body can heal itself Your body, mind and spirit are connectedWhen most people think of the circus, they conjure up the big top and the three rings of a traditional circus. A caravan rolls into town. A big collared cat jumps through a fiery hoop. A child rides on a saddled elephant's back. A glamour girl flies effortlessly on the trapeze, rhinestones pinned in her hair. Beneath the glitz, an underbelly of power and danger, just out of sight of the patrons who come desiring only to be swept away. She ran away to join the circus. What some see as a momentary escape, a fantastical, sequined world, a way out of a regular job \u2014 other people see as quite the opposite: a way of being present in a world that wants us to check out. I wasn't born into a circus family. I found contemporary circus arts (which forego animal acts and focus on character development and storytelling) in a modern way: a friend posted a static trapeze pic on Facebook and I said, \"I have to try that.\" The first time I touched a trapeze, I hadn't worked out in 10 years. When the instructor at the local circus school said to simply do a leg lift and dangle upside down from my knees, I started to laugh. Who am I kidding , I thought, and later, Oh. I seem to have re-located my abs. As a child, I had spent long hours training as a competitive gymnast \u2014 a sport where the object of the game is to sculpt your body into a flawless machine. A silly prospect, given that we know bodies are not machines, but rather soft, breakable creatures. If gymnastics taught me discipline as a child, which it did, circus arts have taught me to play. Fast-forward a few years. Deep into the process of surviving and healing from violence, I had thrown myself headlong into a helping profession. I took a job as a direct service worker at an LGBT community center. All day, I tended to my community's legitimate needs and worked to honor people's scars, their lives uncorked. I answered the phone when it rang, offering empathy, active listening, and resources for any number of community concerns: poverty, homelessness, drug addiction, rejection from families of origin, and on and on. When I went home at night, I was too numb to sleep or cry. What some see as a momentary escape, a fantastical, sequined world, a way out of a regular job \u2014 other people see as quite the opposite: a way of being present in a world that wants us to check out.\"When I'm upside down, I feel curious, bold, and strong.\" By Katie Livingston Instructors and students practicing together during open gym time at A2 Aviary Katie and her acro-balance partner, Saifee, performing a routineKatie spotting a student in Hand Balance classOn Flying: How Contemporary Circus Arts Teach Adults to PlayThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 84 When a person is in deep play, he or she enters an expressive and imaginative realm, able to create worlds, to make connections, and to feel open to possibilities.Hard as it was, I loved that job. At the center, there were always people to share joys and struggles with. I learned to listen there. I learned that empathy means, I feel you. I learned about all the different shapes trauma can take, about how fierce and resilient people can be when there is little choice but to keep on. There was a nagging feeling in my gut though, what some people call intuition. The feeling told me to find what would make me feel alive, find what would teach me to be in my body again. For the first time since I was a child, I listened. Deep play is a process where people become so engrossed in a task they lose track of time, not because they're checked out, but because they're keyed in. When a person is in deep play, he or she enters an expressive and imaginative realm, able to create worlds, to make connections, and to feel open to possibilities. At a conference in September, I heard the underground comics artist Lynda Barry speak on the topic of art-making as deep play. She described deep play as \"that moment when the kid is playing with the toys and the toys play back.\" There is a moment in adulthood, Barry said, where we're doing our thing, whatever thing it is we like to do, and we realize we're no good at it. Then we start to feel like if we're not good at it, we have no right to do it. The snotty, mean voice comes in, looks at what we've done, and says, \"That's stupid.\" What can be done with that voice? The one that says: be reasonable, you can't do that, it's too late, stick to what you know. Trapeze helps me to play that voice away. These days, I teach and play at The Ann Arbor Aviary, where I am grateful to take part in a growing community of local contemporary circus artists. When I'm upside down, I feel curious, bold, and strong. When I'm working with a creative partner, I am learning, through play, what it feels like to support another person and be supported. When I'm teaching circus arts, I am really teaching consent, teaching students to inhabit their bodies and build healthy relationships through communication and connection. For flying to be safe, I have to be in my body. I have to take responsibility for my own and my circus partners' safety. I have to learn to take calculated risks, to respect my body's boundaries and limits, to be in the moment. My trapeze is there, at the Aviary, wrapped in purple tape. I climb on and dangle from one knee because I have learned to trust that I can hold my own weight. I throw my head back and look at the clouds. On the ground, one character travels by handstand, a flower clasped in their toes. Others use their hips or their wrists or their voices to tell stories. I climb up and hold one rope, arch my belly toward the floor and lean out over the trapeze. This pose is called mermaid. She abandoned her siren song, left the sea for the open air. I lean forward, poised like a bird on a perch. This pose is called swallow, a bird to help you find your way back home. The Ann Arbor Aviary is located at 4720 S. State Road, Ann Arbor 48108.

When we open our hearts . . . we can feel it. When we open our minds . . . we shall see it! \u2014Timothy Pina The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 91The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 92 I recognized, early in my career, the limitations existing in my profession as a psychologist when it came to helping clients heal from trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (P .T.S.D.). During my years working in mental health emergency, I saw people at the height of their vulnerabilities, exhibiting symptoms such as flashbacks, severe depression, suicidal thoughts, psychotic breaks from reality, and panic attacks mimicking heart attacks. Their traumas created a living nightmare that kept recycling. Clients were able to find temporary relief through talk therapy, which taught coping strategies, and through medication, which helped to medically manage symptoms, but there was nothing to help cure their discomforts in order for them to become fully functioning and well. Intuitively, I knew there was something more \u2014 something that would not simply manage, but alleviate and even cure menacing symptoms, all without the side effects of medication. I studied Touch for Health, esoteric healing, craniosacral therapy, and Reiki. While helpful in invoking a relaxation response, these techniques still didn't cure panic attacks, severe depression, or the flashbacks of P .T.S.D. I also studied E.M.D.R. (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), which held much promise, but then I stumbled upon Energy Psychology, and I knew that I had found what I was looking for. Energy Psychology is a family of integrative approaches to psychotherapy, health care treatment, and coaching, that is rooted in ancient mind-body healing traditions. Energy Psychology methods blend the bio-energetic insights of these traditions with the best of contemporary psychological practice. Methods include tapping acupuncture points, stimulating chakras, and biofield work. When I first began using Energy Psychology methods with clients, I was amazed when they returned and said their symptoms had drastically reduced or had gone away completely. We would sit together in wonderment, sometimes laughing and shaking our heads in disbelief. The extraordinary results I experienced with a variety of emotional discomforts reinforced that I had found what I was looking for. There are currently over 50 published studies showing the efficacy and tremendous benefits of using Energy Psychology interventions along with our traditional modes, such as cognitive behavioral therapy. How does Energy Psychology work? The theory behind it suggests that psychological problems are a reflection of disturbed energetic patterns within the mind-body system. The mind-body system involves complex communication between a person's neurophysiology, cognitive-behavioral-emotional patterns, and bioenergy systems. In other words, our nervous system is intricately connected to our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, and disturbances in any of these areas are also reflected in our bioenergy field. Although there are several energy systems associated with our mind-body system, Energy Psychology works with three major systems to rebalance and create health and wellbeing: the meridians (fourteen channels of energy used in acupuncture that are associated with organs and emotions), chakras (seven major energy centers that store our emotional history and vitalize our endocrine and organ systems), and the biofield, or aura, (several layers of energy associated with self-regulation of boundaries and relationships). Well-balanced energy in the meridians, chakras, and biofield help to vitalize us physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. Talking about things is helpful for people to understand them, but we mistakenly believe that if we understand why something is happening, then we will be able to fix it. However, it turns out that you can fully understand the root of your problem \u2014 where it started, how it started, and so on \u2014 and still feel like you are getting punched in the gut with an emotional reaction when something triggers that problem. So we need to do something beyond talk because talk is a left-brain phenomenon \u2014 it doesn't live where the emotions are, and it doesn't necessarily reach the emotions. The success of Energy Psychology appears to derive from a synergistic effect of focusing attention on specific memories and other cognitive-affective experiences while teaching clients how to activate the body's energy systems to normalize functioning, including disruptions in the brain and the brain stem. The results typically transcend the normal ability to change experience through conscious effort. Another way of saying this is that Energy Psychology can help release stuck energy that is associated with specific emotions and memories \u2014 memories that keep a person stuck in the past, such as flashbacks of an accident or another traumatic event that occurred long ago but feels like it just happened yesterday. It allows us to restructure and balance those thoughts to re-harmonize our Talking about things is helpful for people to understand them, but we mistakenly believe that if we understand why something is happening, then we will be able to fix it.How does Energy Psychology work? The theory behind it suggests that psychological problems are a reflection of disturbed energetic patterns within the mind-body system... (these) powerful healing methods engage and release (that) disturbed energy as new neural pathways develop in the brain.Energy Psychology methods include tapping acupuncture points, stimulating chakras, and biofield work. Energy Psychology \u2014 When Talk Therapy Just Isn't Enough! By Joanne KarpinenThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 93 body and mind in the presence of what once used to trigger the strong negative emotions. When the body-mind is rebalanced in that context, the trigger no longer has the ability to automatically elicit the negative emotional response. These powerful healing methods engage and release disturbed energy as new neural pathways develop in the brain, so a person doesn't have to continue to go back and experience her/his trauma in the same way; they can now progress in life with energy that supports forward movement. Addressing disturbances in thought and emotion while simultaneously engaging the energy system of the body allows for more rapid processing of a variety of emotional conditions. Let's say, for example, we tap with our fingers on a meridian point that is associated with the kidneys and the emotion of fear. If we tap on the surface where that meridian point is, a piezoelectric effect occurs, which means that the pressure from our finger has created positive and negative polarity, like a battery that generates electricity. Crystalline structures release an electrical impulse every time they are perturbed, so the bone, the collagen, and the fibers in the body release electrical impulses every time we tap. And those electrical impulses stimulate the meridian all the way down to the organ it is associated with. This is just one of the many marvelous things we've discovered about the body's incredible communication system. In Energy Psychology, the healing process is facilitated when the different energy systems talk with each other. We also assess for electromagnetic disturbances in the nervous system and the poles of the body's magnetic charge. If you think about putting a battery into a flashlight the wrong way, it won't work properly. It's like that with our nervous system \u2014 we want to make sure our polarities are functioning properly so we are open for optimal healing. If treatment doesn't hold, it can often be traced back to an electromagnetic or polarity disturbance so we work on correcting them right from the start. Energy Psychology interventions are often taught to clients to help them self regulate between sessions and reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety, anger, guilt, and trauma. There are a number of approaches. The most common is the Emotional Freedom Technique (E.F.T.), or tapping, which is meridian based. Thought Field Therapy (T.F.T.), the original Energy Psychology technique, is also meridian based. Another approach is Tapas Acupressure Technique, which involves meridians and the biofield. Comprehensive Energy Psychology (C.E.P .) uses meridians, biofields and In my practice, I use E.F.T., T.F.T., C.E.P ., and Eden Energy Medicine, along with a few other modalities. When I found \"something more\" in Energy Psychology some years ago, I had no idea how significantly it would transform my life. As a therapist, I began to enter a different kind of healing space with my clients, one where their inner wisdom would bypass their logic and talk to me in ways that helped me guide them into their vibrational energetic patterns and the space where miracles can occur. As a person, I began to work with my own energy on a daily basis (and still do) as I began to shift old energy patterns that I hadn't even known were wreaking havoc beneath the surface. As the saying goes, \"Physician, heal thyself.\" Joanne Karpinen received her Ph.D. in clinical psychology from Union Institute and University, and her Psy.S. in clinical and humanistic psychology and education from the Michigan School for Professional Psychology.

If not for life altering events that happened to me in the late 1980s, I would have viewed the topic with a great deal of skepticism. However, life had other plans for me. After my marriage and career as a clinical laboratory technologist ended, I found myself in the midst of a spiritual awakening that may have presented itself outwardly as a mental collapse or breakdown. My life as I knew it had ended, and a new life was beginning to emerge. It was in therapy that I first started looking inwardly at my dream life. I was being awakened from the rational world of facts, figures, and precise details to the fascinating world of the metaphorical. Twenty-four years later, dreams are my passion. They have guided me in amazing and mysterious ways to the work I do today. While picking up the pieces of the life that had crashed around me, I made the decision to go back to school. I allowed myself to delve into the arts and psychology, and at the age of 38, I discovered hidden talent as a visual artist. The discovery was preceded by a dream. In the dream I found myself at a yard sale. In the middle of a huge stack of baby furniture, there was a drawing table. I took the symbol of a drawing table as a sign and registered for my first drawing class. I felt totally out of my element but moved past any fear I was feeling and took the plunge. I never thought I could draw anything past the level of your basic stick figure. Imagine my amazement after taking only a few art classes that I could actually produce beautiful acrylic paintings. And it didn't end there. I took singing lessons, piano, photography, and I also started writing poetry. All the skills I learned during that period of self-discovery prepared me for the next phase: the field of art therapy. After graduating from Madonna University with a degree in fine art, I was left with a dilemma \u2014 how to make a living. I happened to come across information on a master's program in art therapy program at Wayne State University. It was the perfect field that would combine my interests in psychology and the study of symbolism and dreams. My clinical training focused on working with clients in inpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment facilities. Due to cuts in mental health care and the closing of psychiatric facilities, the job prospects in art therapy were daunting. I had to find a way to use my skills in other capacities. Always listening to the guidance of my dreams and the voice of my intuition, I gradually found new avenues to use my skills and interests in the world. Over the It was in therapy that I first started looking inwardly at my dream life. I was being awakened from the rational world of facts, figures, and precise details to the fascinating world of the metaphorical.If there is anything you've secretly wished to do but have been too afraid to try, chances are you're onto something. Inspired by her dreams, Nancy Paton uncovered many creative talents in midlife \u2014 among them, acting, music, and photography \u2014 all of which led her to the field of art therapy. Pictured above: her photo of roses in a tree.years I have taught at colleges and universities, curated large scale art exhibits on trenchant social issues, and conducted workshops on creativity and the study of dreams and symbolism. My interests have evolved over time, but one thing that has always remained is my interest in dreams \u2014 the thread that binds all outward interests together. Because of my experience uncovering hidden talents later in life, I've taken it as my mission to encourage others to open their minds to the possibility they may be sitting on a goldmine. If there is anything you've secretly wished to do but have been too afraid to try, chances are you're onto something. For years I secretly wished I could be an actor, although, for most of my adult life, I was painfully shy. The fact that I can actually speak in public these days is a miracle. I remember for many years admiring public speakers and studying them intently. A dream many years ago showed me that I would be a speaker one day and the actual place where I would be speaking. Back then I couldn't believe it, but the dream did come true. For anyone seeking to understand dreams, I recommend the book The Mystical, Magical, Marvelous World of Dreams by Wilda B. Tanner. It's also helpful to join a dream group or to find someone to share your dreams with on a consistent basis. Learning to decipher dreams is a skill that you develop over time. Keeping a dream journal will also help in the interpretation process. Above all else, it's the willingness to look within that's essential. I've met people who are afraid of their dreams. Perhaps they had a frightening nightmare that temporarily shut down the ability for them to remember their dreams. Dreams lose their ability to scare you when they are viewed metaphorically and are not taken literally. Generally, all characters in the dream are aspects of the dreamer. When viewed in this manner, they can reveal aspects of the psyche that would have remained hidden. If you're open, your dreams will show you a brave new world of possibilities.

An astrology chart has something to say about absolutely anything one can ask.This empowering concept thrilled me, since I had never conceived of the idea that a person had any option to strengthen or counteract the events described in his or her birth chart. There is an extremely useful \"mahadasha\" system to plot the unfolding time periods unique to one's life, each ruled by different planetary influences. Veda (noun): 1. The most ancient Hindu scriptures, written in early Sanskrit and containing hymns, philosophy, and guidance on ritual for the priests of Vedic religion. If the word \"Veda\" is familiar at all, it is likely to evoke images of Hindu mythology. Or it might remind you of the word \"Ayurveda,\" which refers to a system of healing based on elemental energies. The Western concept of a magical and superstitious India might be why I was surprised to see the country pop up in the BBC documentary The History of Mathematics, which explained that Vedic scholars set forth advanced mathematical treatises 1,000 to 3,000 years ago. They described the concept of zero, the 10-based value method, the techniques of algebra and algorithm, and square root and cube root, for the first time in recorded history. Sanskrit words contextually and phonetically similar to \"geometry\" and \"trigonometry\" appear in mathematical texts dating from before India's contact with Greece, and the word \"algebra\" comes from the title of the first foreign book describing Indian methods of calculation. Why did the ancient Indian seers need to invent methods to make such complex calculations? What were they doing? Perhaps the most important thing by their reckoning was the calculation of Vedic astrological charts. These charts were cast not only for the birth of kings but also for the beginning of journeys, at the outset of important endeavors, or in any given moment to seek guidance. I first discovered Vedic astrology when I began to practice Kundalini yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan. Yoga and Ayurveda are both said to be branches of Jyotish (Vedic astrology), the \"science of light.\" The founder of the yoga studio where I practiced was a wise old Vedic astrologer named Mehtab. At the time, I had lost interest in astrology, but a friend bought a reading by Mehtab as a gift for me. When he performed my first chart reading, I discovered that my interest in India and the Vedas went much deeper than I ever imagined. I had grown up learning about Western astrology, which my mother liked and was very popular among her friends, but the astrology that Mehtab used was an ancient and detailed form I had never seen. It included \"remedial measures\" prescribed by the Vedic texts. Any problem that could be defined came with an array of treatments to correct it. Whether the subject preferred gems, color therapies, aroma therapies, mantra, meditations, dietary or lifestyle changes, there was an appealing option somewhere in each chart to improve life. This empowering concept thrilled me, since I had never conceived of the idea that a person had any option to strengthen or counteract the events described in his or her birth chart. An astrology chart has something to say about absolutely anything one can ask. In Western astrology, this information reads like a description of a static pre-destined path. Not so in Vedic astrology, which emphasizes the impact of free will, describing the precise tools each individual can use to reach his or her unique potential. Ironically, I found that Vedic astrology treated the planets much more like symbols of personal and practical concepts in life than their unyielding and often tyrannical Western counterparts, which suddenly seemed oddly superstitious by comparison.In a Vedic astrology class taught by Mehtab, I learned what he called \"arcane knowledge,\" which inspired me to begin making charts and diagrams, exploring and arranging new and old concepts that took on new meanings. Planets, chakras, linguistics, aesthetic, and stylistic choices all revealed their interrelationships and intrinsic meanings. The first surprise I uncovered was in my own chart. \"My sign\" was not my actual sign at all. Since the Western zodiac does not account for the procession of the Earth's poles, it is in error by more than a week, meaning that there is a good chance that your Western signs are incorrect. The Western system slides a little bit more out of whack each year, while the Vedic system remains accurate in any century. It showed that all three of my main signs were wrong. The traditional 12 signs are further divided into 27 smaller sub-signs, which explained how two people in the same sign can be so different \u2014 something I really took issue with in Western astrology. In Vedic Astrology the planets each signify a category of roles and activities at play in a person's life. Their hierarchy of importance follows the same basic order as the actual influence they have on the surface of the Earth itself. The Earth's orientation, your rising sign, is most important as it represents your body and personality. Second is the moon, which represents your inner mental and emotional state. Third, the sun, signifies the soul and indicates your dharma, public life, and the effects of authority upon you. Next are the five visible planets, like character archetypes, representing their own roles and activities in the world. Each has a strong personality, and is located in one of twelve houses describing every domain of life, in a sign that adds its own atmosphere. So, basically, the planets are like people and the roles they play. The houses are areas of life, like career or home. The signs are the condition and feel of those areas. There is also an extremely useful \"mahadasha\" system to plot the unfolding time periods unique to one's life, each ruled by different planetary influences. This is not to say that they dictate what happens. Instead, they mark the influences and probabilities at different stages, giving us a heads up when it might be a good or bad time to start a business, have a child, go to school, or any other activity we might consider. The world around us is full of tools with hidden meaning that we can use as we assert our own free will. Ayurveda is meant to be used with Vedic astrology to not only heal the body but to support all of life's activities. We are all meant to solve the unique puzzle of our lives. What is the use of much speaking? What ever object exists in this moving and non-moving world cannot be understood without the base of Ganita (mathematics). - from the Vedanga Jyotisha text, 1,000 B.C.E. ### Brandi Lyons is a concept artist and Vedic astrologer, who recently moved to Ann Arbor from Austin, Texas. She has studied Vedic astrology and Kundalini for three years, and she spends her time tinkering with diagrams as she seeks to recombine ancient systems for healing into a new form with practical modern applications.

Please describe your mission as a raw food chef. A. My passion is to inspire men and women to take charge of their lives, learn to control diabetes, and begin feeling really good! I inspire clients to go outside their comfort zone beyond a vegetarian lifestyle of coffee, soy, wheat, and problem grains to a plant based lifestyle of green smoothies, energy soup, fresh fruit, greens for calcium, beans for protein, soaked nuts, and sprouted seeds. Raw chocolate is fine, but animal food and fat must go. I like to convert traditional recipes to healthy, tasty treats. Q. In your classes, you often demonstrate the process of \"uncooking\" food. How do you go about this? A. Cooking or baking food at higher than 115 degrees destroys vitamins and enzymes. I start with traditional cooked food recipes and remove the ingredients that require baking \u2014 dairy, wheat, and eggs \u2014 and substitute dates, nuts, plus cacao to make \"no bake brownies\" or \"no bake sweet potato pie\" from sweet potatoes, dates, and pecans. To me, \"raw food\" is fresh fruits, veggies, seeds, and nuts that can be easily prepared by using a knife, blender, and food processor. No microwaved foods. Hippocrates, the father of medicine, was right when he said, \"The natural healing force within each one of us is the greatest force in getting well. Our food should be our medicine. Our medicine should be our food.\" Foods we eat can be a healing force. This is just as valid today. Q. Where do you offer classes? A. I offer raw food classes at Crazy Wisdom Bookstore, Quaker House (Ann Arbor Friends Meeting House), Charlie's Natural Foods in Frankfort, Michigan, as well as retreat events from \"A Walk on the Beach\" in South Haven, Michigan, to the \"January-in-Jamaica\" retreat. Q. What inspired you to become a raw food chef? A. When Karyn's Raw Caf\u00e9 in Chicago offered a chef class, I signed up and began making smoothies and chocolate desserts at home. I was inspired by nutrition training and learning. I also had 17 food allergies (coffee, milk, cheese, and gluten, to name a few), so I had to change my diet, and I became a chef. I earned a Raw Chef II certification from the Creative Health Institute and a nutrition certification from nutrition expert Andrea McNinch. Q. Tell us about some of the places you've traveled and how traveling changed your view of the American diet. A. My journeys led me to 12 countries. I lived on local native foods in Asia, GREEN SMOOTHIE RECIPE 1 apple, quartered 1 orange with pulp1 handful of spinach1 ripe organic banana1/2 lime, juiced1/2 avocado Add 2 cups filtered water Blend slow/high for 1 minuteServe with 1/2 lime, sliced Fills two tall glassesQUESTIONS FOR JOHN RASMUSSEN Raw Food Chef and Personal Health Coach Europe, North and South America, New Zealand, and the Caribbean. The Standard American Diet (SAD) is rich in calories but deficient in nutrition. When we leave traditional native foods behind, we are much more likely to become sick. Q. It's remarkable that you began to change your lifestyle at age 47 and then went on to complete the Alaska marathon at age 59. Please tell us about that experience. A. Having surgery to remove enlarged parathyroid glands at 47 was a wake-up call to change my lifestyle. Instead of pills, a raw food and living foods lifestyle helped me recover. I gained energy and lost 40 pounds. An experience I had at the Tampa Bay Marathon inspired me to enter the Alaska marathon. At the time, my best running distance was 5 km or 10 km. In the Tampa Bay race, I was ready to stop at mile 6 until I met a runner training for the Special Olympics. I learned that the first-time runner was recovering from a prior accident. We inspired each other and both ran (and walked) to the mile 16 mark. Walking back to Ybor City after the marathon, I picked up an 8-by-10-inch piece of cardboard. Written in pen, it says, \"Mile 6 Tampa Bay Marathon.\" This sign is now on my wall as a reminder not to quit too soon. I then joined the Team in Training Program of the America Leukemia Association and trained for the Alaska Midnight Sun Marathon as a walker rather than a runner. On marathon day, I started slow. Some flew by me. At the finish I passed a runner. It felt good to finish the Alaska Marathon. No injuries. No pain. I was 59 at the time, but I felt like 39! I took my time. I finished. Q. Wha t might you eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner on a typical day? A. A green smoothie with fresh fruit and kale for breakfast and a salad with fruit and raw nuts for lunch. I also like fresh salsa or crisp veggies with hummus, steamed quinoa or sweet potatoes, (cooked) beans and greens, corn bread, and dessert treats. Q. How have you seen better food choices affect others in a positive way? A. For one woman, we found that skipping breakfast led her to gain weight because she would then eat late into the night. Skipping meals activates \"survival genes\" to store food, which leads to weight gain. Weight loss is sustainable with a healthy lifestyle. For her, a consistent breakfast of apple, cinnamon, walnuts, and oatmeal led to weight loss. Another man with Type II diabetes attended my Diabetes Prevention classes, which helped him significantly. Eating animal fats and dairy blocked his uptake of insulin for Type II diabetes. Plant based foods for breakfast, lunch, and dinner let him feel great, have more energy, and shed weight. His doctor reduced his medications. Chef John is a graduate of the University of Michigan School of Business Administration.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2014 Page 115 by Nancy Ogilvie Funny how one phone call can change your life dramatically in an instant. On Thursday, May 30, 2013, a doctor at U-M hospital called to say my mother had been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. That was enough of a shock, and then he added the prognosis \u2014 she likely wouldn't live through the summer. I was stunned; there had been no forewarning whatsoever, and she was never a smoker. There's nothing quite like knowing you're about to lose someone you love to make life crystal clear. I had been in a time of questioning and doubt about my life, confused about what was next. I was immediately compelled to spend the rest of my mom's life with her and my dad. It took me a day to tie up the loose ends of my life in Santa Cruz, California, indefinitely, and I was on a plane to Ann Arbor on Friday, May 31. That Saturday, my mom and I were sitting in her room in assisted living at Glacier Hills after dinner. At a lull in the conversation, she said to me, \"I've been thinking about the adventure I have ahead of me and wondering what it'll be like.\" Being slow to catch on for a moment, I suggested that we could start making a list of questions for the doctor. She smiled and with a twinkle in her eye replied, \"Oh, so you think I should ask the doctor what heaven will be like?... I don't think so.\" So, two days after the shock of learning she had a terminal illness, two days after deciding not to seek treatment but to enter hospice care, she was thinking of herself as starting an adventure! And she sustained that attitude through the rest of her life \u2014 living to her fullest capacity; demonstrating extraordinary courage, curiosity, and faith; clearly at peace with her life \u2014 and death. These are the final gifts she left me. Witnessing her through that \"adventure\" was full of \"final gifts\" from her that I will treasure always. My aim in writing this essay is to highlight a few of those gifts, to pay tribute to this amazing woman who was (and in a different way, still is) my mother, and to share her story in hopes that it will be inspiring and perhaps comforting to others. Living Life Fully Even knowing she was dying, my mom found the courage to continue showing up fully for life. Our days were filled with the people and activities she loved: we celebrated my brother's birthday with take-out from the Gandy Dancer; good friends visited from Massachusetts and we had a picnic at Gallup Park; we read her favorite mystery writer, Ruth Rendell, and listened to choral music she had sung over her lifetime. Most evenings, I helped her get ready for bed, tucked her in, and prayed with her. She continued the long-time ritual of cuddling on the sofa with my dad while they watched the evening PBS news. Witnessing the deep love and affection between them after almost 63 years of marriage was intensely bittersweet. As the disease progressed, she of course became weaker and increasingly dependent on help. She had more days when she just wasn't up to getting dressed \u2014 although very few when she stayed in bed. Even when she began to lose control of her \"bodily functions,\" she kept her grace and dignity and continued to engage in life as fully as she was able. Accepting the Truth Rather than bemoan her fate or fight the inevitable, my mom chose to accept the truth of what was happening. She used her remaining time to deepen an already deep and abiding faith. We had many conversations exploring her original curiosity about what heaven might be like. We read books about angels and the glimpses dying people give into what's after this life. She was certain she would be reunited with people who had gone before, and looked forward to seeing them again. She had a long phone conversation with an Episcopal monk who had played a significant role in her spiritual life and development. She asked a dear friend who is a minister to help plan her memorial service. She told me more than once that she wasn't afraid to die but that it was horrendous to contemplate leaving her family behind. Those were the only times I ever saw her sad or distressed. At one point, she said to me, \"I know I'm going on a long trip soon, and I feel like I should be packing, but I know I don't need to pack for this trip.\"Simply Fearless LoveThe end came abruptly, with no warning whatsoever. One weekend, Mom was going about living her life as fully as she could, accepting the truth of what is. She had been able to go to the dining room for dinner on Saturday, and my sister-in-law had taken her to Big Boy on Sunday for supper. The following Tuesday, she had a dramatic downturn, and spent most of the day in bed. When the hospice nurse saw her around 5:00 p.m., she told me Mom had started her end-of-life phase, and that she likely wouldn't see the weekend. My brother and sister and their partners assembled, and the five of us began sitting vigil around the clock at Mom's bedside, taking turns sleeping on the recliner or love seat or floor in her room. My dad joined us frequently. Five very different adults sleeping in a single room together with their dying mother/mother-in-law for seven days and nights could have been disastrous, but the room was so filled with simply fearless love that we never exchanged even one cross word. My sister-in-law expressed it best \u2014 the love Mom had given us so freely for so many years was circulating back to her as we held her in love through her last days. As word started spreading that Mom was in her last few days, a parade of friends and Glacier Hills staff who had cared for her began coming to pay their final respects. Her minister friend called every day, and I'd hold the phone to my mom's ear while she spoke words of love and comfort. On Wednesday, Mom was still relatively alert and aware \u2014 enough to ask, \"What's happening? Why are all these people coming to see me?\" When my brother told her they were saying their goodbyes because it seemed like she wasn't going to be with us much longer, her response was, \"I know. I'm not afraid.\" By Thursday, she no longer had the energy to speak but continued interacting with us by raising her eyebrows or smiling or squeezing a hand, or occasionally frowning in mock disapproval of what we were saying. Words weren't necessary to express the love that was so palpably present in the room. That evening, we were gathered around her bed sharing stories, laughing and crying together while Mom slept. She woke up, clearly wanting to join the conversation, and tried to speak, but just couldn't. Yet she stayed engaged with us without words. The grief on her face was poignant. I realized later how much energy \u2014 and love \u2014 it must have taken for her to wake up and be so present, even nonverbally. For the next few days, Mom was clearly \"between the worlds,\" seemingly talking with loved ones who had gone before her. She called out \"Daduh,\" her name for her father, and \"Bampi,\" her grandfather, at different points. In one of those conversations, she said clearly, \"Not now,\" like she was telling someone she wasn't ready to cross over yet. Several times, we thought her death was imminent, and several times, she surprised us. She died peacefully on Tuesday, August 20, at 10:40 a.m. The time between her breaths simply got longer and longer until there were no more. From start to finish, and especially when my siblings and partners joined in during Mom's final week, our journey together was a profoundly sacred experience for me. We saw beyond our humanity to the spiritual Being that lives in each of us. I beheld her divinity, and she mine, and we were expressions of Divine Love in our interactions with each other. This was Mom's last gift: simply fearless love, that quality of Divine Love that is ineffable and self-renewing. This Love never ends.
