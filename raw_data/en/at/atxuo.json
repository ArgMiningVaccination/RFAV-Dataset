Over the years the practice has found its way into the West, taking place in popular wellness cures and healing practices. The first use of Ayurveda is still unconfirmed, for some say it was used as early as the Indus Valley Civilization. Thus, ayurvedic practices were initially passed down orally and have only been transcribed a few thousand years ago. As a result, there is a lot of hearsay and no scientific backing to these practices. The Art of Ayurveda essentially deals with channeling the powers of your own mind, body and spirit. Ayurveda is all about balancing these three elements, while harmonizing with the three doshas (health types): vata, pitta and kapha. Every being has each of these three elements, but in different proportions. The key is to identify the dosha that is more prominent versus the one that is less, and achieve an equilibrium or balance between them. Vata Vata is all about the energy of movement and can be associated with the element of air or wind. This dosha is linked with flexibility and creativity. A vata person thinks, walks and talks fast, but is also very easily fatigued. When unbalanced, a person may experience fear, anxiety as well as illness relating to air, such as constipation and arthritis. Some general wellness tips to balance your vata dosha are to keep warm and calm. Eat and consume warm foods and avoid any frozen goods. Finally, try to keep a regular routine and get enough sleep. Pitta This dosha signifies the energy of metabolism and is associated with the element of fire. Pitta dosha is linked with leadership and sharp intelligence, but also with anger and jealousy. Medically, a person with high pitta dosha may experience frequent fire related concerns like fevers, inflammatory diseases or irritations like sore throat, conjunctivitis or jaundice. Some lifestyle changes may help balance this dosha. For instance, avoiding hot, steamy, and oily foods, while instead eating cool, non-spicy foods can help balance the pitta dosha. Reducing your salt intake and exercising during the evenings rather than sunny mornings is beneficial as well. Kapha The final dosha represents the energy of lubrication. Those with a high kapha dosha are blessed with strength, endurance and stamina. Elements associated with this dosha are that of earth and water. Kapha people tend to be calm and composed, but an imbalance can lead to greed and envy. Imbalances in kapha dosha can cause water related ailments like sinus problems, the flu and congestion. Practices like exercising regularly, keeping active and avoiding daytime naps can help balance the dosha. Dietary changes such as avoiding heavy, oily and fatty foods, avoiding dairy and staying away from cold foods can aid in preventing illnesses. Conclusion So, start by taking a small step and balance your doshas. If you think ayurveda is the best fit for you, do a deep dive research before making any drastic changes in your lifestyle. After all when it comes to your health, it is always better to be safe than sorry. "}
