The other components include epithelial ion transporters, which mediate the secretion of the oxidizable anion thiocyanate (SCN 2) into airway catalyzes the H 2O2-dependent yield antimicrobial molecule hypothiocyanite (OSCN2). We hypothesized that this oxidative host defense system is also active against respiratoryviruses. We evaluated the activity of oxidized LPO substrates against encapsidated and enveloped viruses. When tested for antiviral properties, the LPO-dependent production of OSCN 2did not in- LPO substrate reduction of when LPO and I2were supplied. The administration of a single dose of 130 mg of oral potassium iodide to human subjects increased serum I2 concentrations, and resulted in the accumulation of I2in upper airway secretions. These results suggest that the LPO/I2/H2O2 system can contribute to airway antiviral defenses. Furthermore,the delivery of I 2to the airway mucosa may augment syncytial virus; adenovirus; lactoperoxidase; thiocyanate; respiratory tract infections represent enor- mous disease burdens for infants, children, and adults through- out the world. In children, acute lower respiratory infections are the most frequent cause of mortality worldwide (1, 2). Despite the prevalence and severity of these infections, few specic prophylactic or therapeutic interventions are available for many of these common diseases, including effective vaccines or anti- viral treatments. For example, Group B and C adenoviruses are frequent causes of bronchiolitis and pneumonia, and occasion- ally cause postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans (3, 4). Although respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause ofacute lower respiratory infections throughout the world (5), no effective vaccine or specic, widely used antiviral therapy is available. In evaluating novel approaches to antiviral defenses, we considered the redundant layers of innate immunity at play in the airways. We questioned whether an existing host defense mechanism might be induced or augmented to achieve en- hanced antiviral protection in the lung. Both nonoxidative and oxidative host defense systems contribute to the antimicrobial activity of airway surface liquid (ASL) (6). Although the host defense roles of many secreted proteins and peptides are well- characterized, recognition that the airway epithelium orches- trates This reactive oxygen species-producing system consists of the airway epithelial proteins dual oxidase (DUOX) 1 and 2, lactoperoxidase (LPO; of this LPO/halide/H 2O2airway mucosal defense system has not been investigated for pathogens. The LPO-catalyzed oxidation of I2produces hypoiodous acid (HOI) (13). Both OSCN2and HOI are short- lived, reactive intermediates that are known to be bactericidal. We hypothesized that this oxidative antimicrobial system might possess functional relevance for preventing respiratory viral infections, through the generation of OSCN2or HOI. Here we show that the delivery of I2to respiratory epithelial cells supports the generation of HOI in ASL. HOI, but not OSCN2, readily inactivates adenovirus and RSV. Supplementation with I2may serve to augment mucosal antiviral defenses.

We selected adenovirus, a protein-encapsidated DNA virus, because it is an important respiratory pathogen. To test whether reactions generating OSCN2or HOI inhibit infection with adenovirus, we mixed both complete and incomplete LPOmixtures with recombinant Ad5-CMV-eGFP under cell-free conditions, and used the expression of eGFP to monitor the virus transduction of target cells. In Figure 1A, we show that the addition of the replete HOI-generating reaction completely abrogated transduction by Ad5-CMV-eGFP. By contrast, a comparable OSCN 2-generating reaction failed to block trans- duction. None of the incomplete LPO reactions possesseddiscernable antiviral activity. H 2O2alone did not inhibit in- fection by adenovirus. Inactivation of Adenovirus by Hypoiodous Acid Is pH-Dependent The pH of airway surface liquid is slightly acidic, with pH values ranging from 6.57-7.18 (19-21). To determine whether or not the inactivation of adenovirus by HOI was pH-dependent, we monitored adenovirus titers after exposure to HOI across pH ranges from 5-8. At a pH between 6 and 7, the application of LPO, I2, and H 2O2was signicantly more virucidal than at physiologic pH (Figure 1B). At pH 8, the oxidation of I2also signicantly reduced the adenovirus titer, compared with Epithelia Produce Hypoiodous Acid in an Iodide Concentration-Dependent Manner We previously reported that well-differentiated airway epithelia generate H 2O2apically, in a DUOX-dependent manner (8). Here we asked whether airway epithelia produced sufcientH 2O2to support the production of HOI in the presence of the physiological LPO concentration of airway surface liquid andI 2. Well-differentiated primary airway epithelia were cultured at the air-liquid interface and stimulated by the apical additionof ATP, which maximizes the DUOX-mediated production of H 2O2(22). The apical buffer (PBS) also contained a range of I2 concentrations and LPO. Although a high concentration ofLPO is maintained in the airway surface fluid by the LPO- secreting submucosal glands (23), the cultured surface airway epithelia do not secrete LPO (data not shown) (9). The production of HOI by airway epithelia was determined accord-ing to the iodination of extracellular NADPH, as previously described (18). As shown in Figure 2A, under these conditions, well-differentiated porcine airway epithelia supported the gen- eration of HOI at a rate similar to that of previously reported H 2O2production (8). Similar results were observed using primary human airway epithelia (data not shown). The additionof the H 2O2scavenger catalase to the apical buffer, or the omission of either LPO or I2, inhibited the generation of HOI, conrming that the production of HOI was dependent on apical H2O2, LPO, and I2. Production of HOI by Epithelia Inhibits Adenovirus Transduction without Evidence of Cytotoxicity To test whether airway epithelia could generate enough reactive product to inactivate adenovirus, primary epithelial cells. Because the Coxsackie virus and adenovirus receptor is expressed basolaterally (24), adenovirus requires prolonged incubation to enter when applied to the apical surface (25). Therefore, the virus was allowed to adsorb overnight to allow for transduction. As shown in Figure 2B, supplementing epithe- lia with LPO and I2at 5mMo 0 mM signicantly reduced the number of eGFP-expressing cells compared with no I2controls, indicating that viral transduction was inhibited. Quantication of the foci of infection indicated that the inactivation of adenovirus was I2dose-dependent (Figure 2C). The addition of 5 mMI2 was sufcient to decrease the foci of infection signicantly. Figure 1. (A) Cell-free inactivation of adenovirus by hypoiodous acid. Replication-decient recombinant a denovirus expressing enhanced fluorescent protein (eGFP) (Ad5-CMV-eGFP) was mixed with combina- tions of H 2O2,N a S C N ,N a I ,a n dl a c t o p e r o x i d a s e( L P O )( 2 0 mg/ml), as described in the text, and incubated for 10 minutes. The virus was thenapplied to monolayers of A549 cells. Cell monolayers were imaged by fluorescence microscopy at 48 hours after transduction to monitor the expression of GFP, and photomicrogra phs were captured. Representative en face views are shown.

Cell-free inactivation reactions forAd5-CMV-eGFP were prepared wi th incomplete or complete (5 mMN I , 20mg/ml LPO, and 100 mMH 2O2) LPO reactions at different pH conditions and incubated for 10 min utes. Samples were then diluted and applied to A549 cells at approximately 50 multiplicity of infection(MOI), and 48 hours later, numbers of eGFP-positive cells were counted by fluorescence microscopy. The percentage of eGFP-positive cells was the average counted from three separate elds. Results are representative ofthree independent experiments.

(A) Rates of hypoiodous acid (HOI) production by ATP- stimulated (100 mM) porcine airway epithelial cells in the presence of apical LPO (6.5 mg/ml) and the indicated I2concentrations (open squares, mean 6SE;n53). The production of HOI was determined by adding nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced (NADPH) (100 mM) to the apical buffer, and measuring changes in absorbance at 282 and 340 nm. The apical buffer of negative control cultures lacked LPO ( solid square ), or was supplemented with 200 U/ml of catalase ( solid triangle ).

We asked whether the production of HOI by airway epithelia was associated with evidence of cell injury bymeasuring the release of LDH. The addition of a complete mixture of LPO, NaI, and H 2O2to well-differentiated epithelia did not result in signicant cell toxicity (Figure 3). Oxidized Forms of I2, but Not SCN2, Are Virucidal against RSV We extended the observations with adenovirus to an envelopedrespiratory virus, RSV. We hypothesized that OSCN 2and HOI might exhibit antiviral activity against RSV. We incubated wild-type RSV for up to 2 hours with 100 mMH 2O2at pH 7.4. Under these conditions, the virus titer was unchanged compared withcontrol PBS (Figure 4A). To test whether oxidized or unoxidized LPO substrates are virucidal, we assembled various mixtures of LPO, I 2,S C N2,H2O2, and approximately 1 3105PFU/ml of RSV (Figure 4A). We found that neither SCN2and I2alone, nor LPO delivered with either I-2or SCN2, decreased the recovery of RSV, compared with PBS. These controls demon-strated that neither LPO nor its substrates were virucidal under these conditions. When a complete reaction mixture of LPO, I 2, and H 2O2was assembled to yield HOI, the RSV titer was rapidly reduced to undetectable levels. Therefore, the generation of HOI is signicantly virucidal against RSV, whereas the oxidation of the RSV titer. Inactivation of RSV by Hypoiodous Acid Is Most Effective at Low pH We evaluated the pH dependence of RSV inactivation by applying either 5 mM NaI or 500 mM NaSCN in cell-free LPO reactions. Because the application of 5 mM NaI results in a suboptimal reduction in RSV titer at pH 7.4 (Figure 4A), we used this concentration to monitor the dependence of buffer pH on virus inactivation in hypoiodous acid-generating reactions. We found that at a pH between 6 and 6.5, the application of LPO, I2, and H 2O2was signicantly more virucidal than at physiologic pH, with at least a 10-fold reduction in RSV titercompared with pH 7 (Figure 4B). Under high pH conditions(pH 8.0), the oxidation of I 2did not substantially reduce the virus titer. The oxidation products of SCN2failed to show sig- nicant antiviral activity across a range of pH conditions. Airway Epithelia Produce Sufcient Hypoiodous Acid for the Inactivation of RSV We next asked whether airway epithelia produce enough HOI to inactivate viruses in situ via the LPO and I2antimicrobial system. Well-differentiated primary human airway epithelia,cultured at the air-liquid interface, were stimulated to produce H 2O2by an apical addition of ATP, and I2was supplied to the cells by addition to the basolateral and apical media. LPO wasadded to the apical surface at a concentration of 6.5 mg/ml (8). We added rrRSV to the apical surface in a total volume of 50 ml, with combinations of ATP, LPO, catalase, and varying concen- trations of I 2. If the epithelia produced sufcient H 2O2,a signicant loss of RFP expression should occur. Indeed, whenI 2was present in the reaction, a dose-dependent decrease in foci of infection was evident, 48 hours after infection (Figure 5).When I 2was present at a concentration of 5 mM, the number of foci of infection decreased, but this trend did not reach sta-tistical signicance. Increasing the concentration of I 2to 500mM resulted in a marked and signicant decrease in the number offoci of infection. The addition of the enzyme catalase rescuedRSV infection. Based on these results, we conclude that human airway epithelia can generate sufcient H 2O2to inactivate RSV when pharmacologic presence of physiologic concentrations of LPO. After Bolus Intake of I2, the Concentration of I2in ASL Exceeds That of SCN2in Humans The secretion of SCN2by the airway epithelium is thought to be mediated by the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) in the basolateral plasma mem-brane (9, 10). Because these SCN 2-transporting proteins are also capable of I2transport, we hypothesized that I2is absent from ASL only because of its low serum concentration (10-100 nM). Toexamine the I 2-secreting capacity of the airway, we performed a study with nine human subjects. After the verication of normalthyroid function (based on blood thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] and free thyroxine [T4] l evels; data not shown), subjects took a potassium iodide tablet orally (130 mg KI, Iosat; AnbexInc., Williamsburg, VA). Twen ty-four hours before the intake of KI, and 2, 6, and 24 hours later, nasal ASL was harvested usingmicrosampling probes (26), and blood was drawn from arm veins for inorganic ion analysis by anion-exchange chromatography (27). Before the intake of KI, the I 2content of ASL was below the detection limit of our assay ( ,0.25mM in 50-fold diluted ASL). However, 2 hours after the intake of KI, I2a c c u m u l a t e di nA S La t approximately 500 mM (Figures 6A and 6B). The concentration of I2in ASL remained in the range of several hundred micromolar for many hours, and exceeded the concentration of serum I2by more than 50-fold at 6 hours (Figures 6B). Interestingly, the concentration of SCN2was reduced in ASL after the intake of KI (Figures 6A and 6C), whereas the serum concentration of SCN2 remained stable. These results suggests that I2and SCN2compete for transepithelial secretion in the respiratory tract. Our data alsoshow that the oral intake of a single KI dose (130 mg) leads to the accumulation of I 2in ASL at concentrations that (based on our cell-culture assays) can support antiviral activities. DISCUSSION Viral respiratory-tract infections are signicant causes of mor- bidity and mortality throughout the world (1). Here we show thatFigure 3. Airway epithelium-dependent production of HOI is not toxic to epithelial cells. Cytotoxicity was monitored by lactate dehydrogenase release assay, as described in M ATERIALS AND METHODS . Well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells were treated overnight under theindicated conditions. These included assay buffer alone (PBS, pH 6.6),and assay buffer containing the indicated combinations of catalase(750 U/ml), ATP (100 mM), LPO (20 mg/ml), and I 2(400mM). Media from both apical and basolateral cell surfaces were harvested andpooled. The positive control represents cells exposed to 1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes at 37 8C. Results shown represent mean 6SE, and are from three independent experiments with cells from three differenthuman donors. *P ,0.05, Student ttest.Fischer, Defense System 877the LPO/I2/H2O2oxidative host defense system demonstrated robust activity against two major respiratory viral pathogens, adenovirus and RSV. Although OSCN2was not effective against either adenovirus or RSV, we discovered that the delivery of the alternative halide substrate I2to the airway epithelium converted the DUOX/LPO enzymes into a HOI-producingantiviral system. Remarkably, HOI exhibited virucidal activity against both encapsidated and enveloped respiratory viruses.Importantly, the oral administration of KI in human subjects increased serum I 2concentrations and yielded I2concentrations in the upper respiratory secretions that supported the antiviralactivity of airway epithelial cells ex vivo . Because the concentra- tion of LPO in our cell-based study was similar to that of in vivo airways (28), we speculate that a topical or systemic supplemen-tation of I 2alone might be sufcient to inactivate virus. The LPO/halide/H 2O2antimicrobial system is a host defense mechanism previously proposed to serve as a nonspecic anti- viral defense (12, 29), particularly in the saliva (30, 31), tears (32), and milk (33). The discovery of DUOX gene products revealed their distribution in human airways (34). The expres- sion of DUOX in epithelia stimulated interest in the role of the LPO/halide/H 2O2system in airway mucosal immunity, because it identied a mechanism for the production of epithelial H 2O2 (11). The two DUOX isoforms, DUOX1 and DUOX2, are encoded by closely spaced genes on human chromosome 15, and are transcribed in opposite directions (35, 36). DUOX uses cytoplasmic NADPH as an electron donor to transfer two electrons to oxygen, which is reduced to H 2O2and released extracellularly. The functions of DUOX1 and DUOX2 are alsodependent on the co-expression of the regulatory proteins DUOXa1 and DUOXa2, respectively (37). Although they are functionally indistinguishable, DUOX1 and DUOX2 are differ- entially regulated. Harper and colleagues previously reported that DUOX2 is inducible by IFN- g, as well as by rhinovirus infection and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly[I:C]) (38).DUOX1 is induced by IL-4 and IL-13 (10, 38), as well as by bacterial products such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa endotoxin, flagellum, and Type III secretion system products (39). Three reports showed that airway epithelial cells supple- mented with both SCN 2and LPO can kill two types of bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa andStaphylococcus aureus (8, 9, 40). This provides evidence that the airway LPO/halide/H 2O2systemFigure 4. (A) Cell-free inactivation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by the generation of HOI.

The recognition that the CFTR anion channel conducts SCN2raised the possibility that patients with cystic brosis (CF) might manifest impaired LPO/halide/H 2O2 microbicidal activity. Indeed, airway epithelia from patients withCF exhibited defects in CFTR-dependent SCN 2transport and defective bacterial killing (8-10). These studies suggest a possiblemechanistic link between CF lung disease and altered function of the LPO/halide/H 2O2system.In vitro , LPO has a high afnity for both SCN2and I2.B e f o r e this study, the I2concentration in ASL had not (to the best of our knowledge) been reported, but SCN2is present in ASL at approximately 450 mM (41). Therefore, SCN2is thought to be the physiologic LPO substrate in the respiratory tract. Whatmechanism favors the accumulation of SCN 2over I2in the airways? Animal cells cannot synthesize SCN2. Thus, the diet is the only source of both SCN2and I2(8, 11, 42, 43). The average concentration of SCN2in serum is approximately 20 mM( 4 4 ) , whereas the average concentration of I2in serum is only 10- 100 nM (45). With a serum concentration of SCN2200-2,000- fold higher than that of I2, the secretion of SCN2predominates. Airway epithelial cells generate an approximately 20-fold serosal-to-mucosal concentration gradient for the secretion of SCN 2by importing SCN2on the basolateral side through NIS (46), and exporting it on the apical side via CFTR and perhaps the anion transporter pendrin (SLC26A4) (9, 10). I2can follow the same secretory pathways. In fact, the NIS also be secreted into the respiratory tract. The data from our investigations of human subjects (Figure 6) support this concept. Therefore, supplementation with I2may allow sufcient I2concentrations in ASL to support the production of HOI. Although chronic treatment with I2may be associated with toxicity, short-term daily administration to humans is safe(48, 49). The topical delivery of I 2may further reduce any risk of systemic toxicity. The mechanism by which hypohalides eliminate bacteria is not yet known, but OSCN2can oxidize thiol groups in surface proteins, thereby mediating conformational changes (13, 50). Although we do not yet know how HOI inactivates adenovirus and RSV, similar mechanisms are likely in play. Adenovirusand RSV represent two different classes of viruses. Adenovirus is a nonenveloped, protein-encapsidated double-stranded DNA virus that enters through endocytosis, whereas RSV is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that enters the cell through receptor-mediated membrane fusion. The results of our cell-free virus inactivation assays are consistent with observations by Belding and colleagues that the peroxidase- mediated oxidation of I 2is strongly antiviral (29). Belding and colleagues further reported that HOI was active against polioand vaccinia viruses, particularly at a low pH (29). Interestingly, the LPO/I 2/H2O2system was most virucidal against both adeno- virus and RSV at slightly acidic pH. Because the pH of ASL isslightly acidic (19-21), these conditions are expected to favor HOI- dependent virucidal activity. We speculate that HOI modies viral surface proteins and prevents the binding or the entry of adenovirus and RSV into the epithelium. Alternatively, HOI may inhibit the synthesis or assembly of viral nucleic acids and proteins, or prevent the release of virus from cells. Our results suggest that the innate oxidative a ntiviral system present in the airways is a nonspecic mechanism to inactivate invading viruses. To test the in vivo efcacy of the antiviral activity of this HOI-generating mechanism, large animal models of viral in-fections are needed, because murine airways lack both LPO and DUOX (8), and rat airways contain few LPO-secreting cells (51). In contrast, the respiratory tracts of larger mammals such as sheep and pigs are similar to those of humans in regard to the expression of LPO and DUOX, anatomy, physiology, innate and adaptive immunity, and susceptibility to viral infection (23, 52). An important question for future study involves whether the inactivation of virus in vivo is limited by the generation of H 2O2, the concentration of I2, or both. In conclusion, the airway LPO/I2/H2O2system exhibits ro- bust antiviral activity against relevant human pathogens. Theidentication of a new prophylactic or therapeutic approach to Figure 6.
