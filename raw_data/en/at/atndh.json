Aim of the study: The aim of study was to explore the effects and mechanism of Codonopsis pilosula aqueous extract (CPAE) intervention in improving ulcerative colitis (UC).Materials and methods: UC model rats were established using 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Tissue specimens were sequenced by transcriptome and metabolomics. Network pharmacology was performed on CPAE to identify bioactive compounds. Western blot was used to detect the key proteins involved in UC pathogenesis and PI3K/AKT pathways. Results: CPAE had the preventive and therapeutic effects through inhibiting abnormal inflammatory responses and promoting antioxidant capacity. Levels of intestinal barrier, oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators were returned to the normal state by CPAE. Metabolome profiles showed that CPAE could restore metabolic disorders associated with the UC pathogenesis. Further transcriptome and network pharmacology results showed that CPAE mainly alleviate UC through inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, various related genes that highly expressed in UC module rats were suppressed by CPAE. Typically, Glycitein was the hub compounds that involved in the mechanism of CPAE in improving UC. Conclusions: The results show that DS was an potential excellent material in treating of UC depending on its suitable concentration. Possible therapeutic mechanisms of the DS involved in mitigating colonal inflammation, restoring metabolic disorders, promoting antioxidant capacity, and especially blocking the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway.
