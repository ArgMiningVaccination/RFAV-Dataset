SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are highly effective in the general population; however, few data are available on their efficacy in patients with cancer. Using a prospective cohort, we assessed the seroconversion rates and anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody titers following the first and second dose of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with cancer in US and Europe from January to April 2021. Among 131 patients, most (94%) achieved seroconversion after receipt of two vaccine doses. Seroconversion rates and antibody titers in patients with hematological malignancy were significantly lower than those with solid tumors. None of the patients with history of anti-CD-20 antibody in the 6 months before vaccination developed antibody response. Antibody titers were highest for clinical surveillance or endocrine therapy groups and lowest for cytotoxic chemotherapy or monoclonal antibody groups.\", keywords = \"COVID-19, anti-cancer treatment, antibody, immune response, malignancy, oncology, pandemic, seroconversion, tumor, vaccine\", author Labidi-Galy and Sara Fertani and Leach, {Robin J.} and Jose Sandoval and Ruben Mesa and Kate Lathrop and Nicolas Mach and Shah, {Dimpy P.}\", note = \"Funding Information: This project has been funded in whole or in part with federal funds from National Cancer Institute grant P30 CA054174 (Mays Cancer Center at University of Texas Health San Antonio MD Anderson); and grant MRSG-16-152-01-CCE the American Cancer Society and Hope Funds for Cancer Research .
