Pennsylvania State University Annual Progress Report: 201 4 Formula Grant Reporting Period January 1, 201 5 - June 30, 201 5 Formula Grant Overview The Pennsylvania State University received $4,608,037 in formula funds for the grant award period January 1, 201 5 through December 31, 2018. Accomplishments for the reporting period are described below. Research Project 1: Project Title and Purpose Research Infrastructure - Biospecimen Processing Core - The purpose of the Biospecimen Processing Core (BPC) is to provide a centralized service for the collection, processing and distribution of human subject research samples for all of the clinical research activity at the Penn State Hershey campus. Anticipated Duration of Project 3/1/201 5 - 12/31 /2018 Project Overview The objective of the project is to design and renovate space on the 6th floor to locate the Biospecimen Processing Core. This will allow researchers to get their samples processed and analyzed in an efficient and accurate manner. As part of the clinical trials program at Penn State Hershey, considerable effort is spent collecting, processing and shipping clinical research specimens. These samples are distributed to internal laboratories, both the centralized clinical laboratory and decentralized specialty laboratories, as well as to external study -specific central laboratories. Processing and distribution of these samples is presently being done in a decentralized fashion and this is leading to inefficiencies and a less -than-optimal use of resources. Creat ion of the Biospecimen Processing Core facility will benefit both our individual researchers and the institution as a whole by providing dedicated equipment and support for processing samples for the vast majority of trials, thereby reducing delays and red undancies across various departments. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E. Report Pennsylvania State University - 2014 Formula Grant Page 2 Principal Investigator Keri Donaldson, MD, MSCE Assistant Professor Penn State University 500 University Drive Hershey, PA 17033 Other Participating Researchers None Expected Research Outcomes and Benefits The current process for identifying, collecting, transporting, storing, and shipping biospecimens is decentralized, inefficient, and not consistent across the institution. The Biospecimen Processing Core will increase access of researchers to a facility desig ned to reduce pre -analytical errors (specimen collection, transport, and sample processing), and improve the efficiency of research and clinical trials relaying on clinical samples. Innovative staffing models and shared resources in the procurement and pre paration of the samples would allow for better study pricing and increased competitiveness of the budgetary and negotiation process. The BPC will provide services that all human subject researchers on the Penn State Hershey Campus will find useful. Clinical faculty involved in extramurally sponsored clinical trials will benefit from this service. The increased efficiency will result in more favorable budgeting of their project. Additional efficiency will be realized by removing these technical tasks from the Clinical Research Professionals supporting these trials. Removing these technical tasks have the potential benefit that a Clinical Research Professional could spend more time on study subject accrual or even supporting additional trials. Some of these trials involve patients seen within the Penn State Hershey system, but at satellite outpatient clinics. The BPC would serve as a centra l resource for these study samples as well. The BPC would also provide experience in coordinating and handling human research samples for multi -site investigator initiated trials. Investigators on the Penn State Hershey Campus are interested in conductin g investigator initiated clinical and translational research. These investigators often lack the experience in appropriate shipping of human research samples. The BPC would serve these investigators as a resource with the necessary supplies and sample shipping requirements Summary of Research Completed The development and implementation of the BPC will occur in three phases transferring workload from the current system to the newly designed core. We have outl ined those phases below indicating completed tasks. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E.

Report Pennsylvania State University - 2014 Formula Grant Page 4 Research Project 2 : Project Title and Purpose Functional Studies of Herpesvirus Tegument Protein UL21 - This study will examine the molecu lar mechanisms of virus replication using the human herpes virus type 1 (also known as HSV -1 or herpes simplex virus) as a model to understand all herpesviruses. The specific goals are to gather new knowledge concerning the functional role of a particular viral protein (UL21) in virus replication and, more specifically, to identify what other viral and cellular proteins it interacts with in the virus replication process. This type of information will not only improve our overall understanding of the virus but will provide new leads that may be translated into advancements in antiviral therapies. Anticipated Duration of Project 7/1/2015 - 12/31/2016 Project Overview The viral tegument structure within infectious herpesvirus virions is a little explored territory for the eventual development of novel therapeutics targeting viral replication functions other than DNA synthesis. The functional roles for the majority of the tegument proteins are unk nown. The UL21 protein, and in particular its highly conserved N -terminal domain, is one of these. What little is known indicates that it likely acts within an extensive network of interactions with other viral and cellular proteins. The overall goal of this study will be to identify candidate interactors of the HSV -1 tegument protein UL21 using a complementary set of genetic and proteomic approaches. In addition, critical new information about the roles of particular conserved amino acids on the UL21 s urface will be obtained. Specific Aims Aim 1. Genetic analyses of UL21 function in HSV Genome analysis of variants derived from UL21 point mutations Aim 2. Mass spectroscopy analysis of potential viral and cellular partners of UL21 Aim 1A is a structure based -analysis of highly conserved surface residues of the UL21 N - terminal domain to examine their functional importance and to correlate particular residues with certain stages of replication. Aims 1B and C will take advantage of the strong tendency of HSV - 1 to adapt to the lack of UL21 function by generating secondary mutations that either alter viral proteins that are functional partners of UL21 or promote replication by UL21 -independent pathways. Finally, with Aim 2 the genetic experiments will be complemented with a proteomic study that is expected to identify potential functional partners of UL21 by a completely independent route. The real value of the se efforts will be that they will allow us to formulate more precise hypotheses about the functions of the UL21 NTD in replication, and in particular more explicit models for the organization of the tegument protein network, which will be addressed in subs equent applications for extramural funding. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E.

Wills, PhD ; Moriah Szpara, PhD - employed by The Pennsylvania State University David Meckes, PhD - employed by Florida State University Expected Research Outcomes and Benefits Herpesviruses exact a huge toll on human health. Include d in this large virus family are the herpes simplex birth defects, post -transplant reactivation of infection ). With the notable exception of v aricella zoster virus, vaccines that are effective for control of the herpesv iral diseases have been difficult to achieve. Herpesviral diseases associated with immunosuppression and/or transplantation remain a particularly difficult problem as the population ages and the use of new immunosuppressive therapies for autoimmune diseas es increases. Several antiviral drugs are used clinically to treat herpesviral diseases but are all targeted to the viral DNA synthesis enzymes. Drug side effects and viral resistance are important clinical problems indicating a need for a much better un derstanding of the virus to identify additional effective targets. The viral tegument structure within infectious herpes virions is a little -explored territory for eventual development of novel therapeutics targeting viral functions other than DNA synthes is. The goal and anticipated outcome of this research project is to gather basic biochemical information about the virus, in particular identifying the intermolecular mechanisms by which one particular tegument protein UL21 functions in virus replication. Uncovering such basic details about the virus will potentially identify novel interactions that can eventually be targeted for antiviral intervention. Summary of Research Completed The project has not yet started. No funds have been spent. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E. Report Pennsylvania State University - 2014 Formula Grant Page 6 Research Project 3 : Project Title and Purpose Identification of Genetic Predictors of Response to the Clinical Management of Bladder Cancer Bacillus Calmette -Guerin (BCG) is the treatment of choice for non -invasive bladder cancer, while cisplatin -based c hemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy is the gold standard treatment for muscle -invasive bladder cancer. BCG reduces tumor recurrence, while ~40% of patients experience a complete pathologic response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The tumor -specific molecular mechanism(s) responsible for response to BCG and cisplatin -based chemotherapy remain unclear. This research seeks to develop the research stream to perform whole exome sequencing on bladder cancer patients, and to identify specific genetic predictors associated with treatment response in patients with bladder cancer . Anticipated Duration of Project 3/1/2015 - 6/30/2016 Project Overview Approximately 70,000 individuals are diagnosed with bladder cancer annually, and almost 15,000 patients die every year. BCG immunotherapy is used clinically for non -muscle invasive bladder cancer, while radical cystectomy represents the standard treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer. Incorporation of cisplatin -based neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to radical cystectomy confers a survival benefit when compared to surgery alone, and is therefore the recommended treatment strategy for advanced disease. While BCG treatment reduces recurrence in early stage bladder cancer, and approximately 40% of patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy exhibit a complete pathologic response, 60% will have residual disease at time of cystectomy with a fraction of them progressing while on chemotherapy agents. Prognosis in such patients is poor. We hypothesiz e that both novel and previously described mutations associated with bladder cancer will be predictive of therapeutic failure in patients undergoing treatment for bladder cancer. The research objective of this project is to develop the research stream nec essary to identify genetic alterations associated with response to therapy in these patients, and to identify the specific genetic traits and/or alterations that are associated with response to therapy in bladder cancer patients. Such knowledge may permit more accurate selection of patients optimally suited to receive and therefore respond to specific treatment regimens. In addition, knowledge gained through this study may identify novel actionable targets for exploitation in bladder cancer patients. We p ropose three specific aims: Aim 1: We will develop a research stream to enable the use of high throughput, next generation exome sequencing to identify differences in the mutational landscape of bladder cancer patients who differentially respond to BCG in the setting of non -MIBC, and cisplatin -based chemotherapy in the setting of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E. Report Pennsylvania State University - 2014 Formula Grant Page 7 Aim 2: We will perform bioinformatics analysis to identify significant differential mutations and genetic alterations in patient transurethr al resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) samples, and dissect the molecular pathways associated with response and resistance to BCG in the setting of non-MIBC, and cisplatin -based chemotherapy in the setting of MIBC. Aim 3: We will determine if alterations in the exonic sequence of a panel of specific genes significantly correlate with therapeutic resistance and/or progression in TURBT specimens.

Raman, M D; Matthew Kaag, MD; Kristin Eckert, PhD Joshi, Sheldon Holder, MD , PhD; Zhaohai Yang, , ; Molly Pells, B S; Syndi Reed, BS ; Joshua Warrick ; Tiffany Bohr, BS - employed by The Pennsylvania State University Expected Research Outcomes and Benefits Bladder cancer is the second most common urologic malignancy with the predilection for recurrence after initial therapy. Thus, the health care associated costs of initial treatment, surveillance, re -treatment, and treatment of associated complications are a major economic burden. Economic studies have shown that among Medicare and non -Medicare beneficiaries bladder cancer has the highest li fetime per -patient cost of all malignancies.4, 5 The identification of a biomarker of response to the standards of care (BCG and cisplatin -based combination chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy) has the potential to personalize therapy and streamline care thereby dramaticall y reducing healthcare costs and resources associated with this disease. Furthermore, this approach could assist in the identification of adjunctive treatment strategies for use in combination with chemotherapy, as well as a second -line targeted approach for individuals who fail neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This therapeutic strategy directed at genetic aberrations has successful precedence in multiple other cancers including lung, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma. Finally, biomarker identification may serve to simplify surveillance regimens for bladder. Specifically, evaluation of biomarker status in urine samples to assess for disease recurrence is a promising, less costly alternative to the current standard of cystoscopy for screening and surveillance. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E. Report Pennsylvania State University - 2014 Formula Grant Page 8 Summary of Research Completed Aim 1: We will develop a research stream to enable the use of high throughput, next generation exome sequencing to identify differences in t he mutational landscape of blad der cancer patients who differentially respond to BCG in the setting of non -MIBC, and cisplatin -based chemotherapy in the setting of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Progress to date: We applied for, and received Internal Review Board (IRB) approval for this project on October 1, 2014. We have made significant progress in developing a research stream to enable the use of next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify mutations associated with the response of bladder cancer patients to clinical treatment. 1. Patient accrual: Jay D. Raman, M.D., and Matthew Kaag, M.D., with the assistance of Molly Pells and the Institute for Personalized Medicine (IPM) have accrued a total of 39 patients into this study . Of the 39 patients accrued, we have transurethral resection (TUR) or bio psy tissue (frozen and formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE)), as well as peripheral blood collected from 25 patients. In addition, we have collected urine from 14 patients at the time of surgery, including 10 patients for whom we have additionally collected tumor and peripheral blood samples. Therefore, we have exceeded our accrual goal of 31 patients into the study by the first reporting period. 2. Selection of tissue from accrued patients for further study: Of the 25 patients with both tumor tissue a nd peripheral blood, Dr. Joshua Warrick has performed an extensive review of FFPE tissue, which will be used for sequencing, resulting in the selection of 16 patients for DNA extraction. We have decided to use FFPE for analysis, as this approach enables D r. Warrick to select areas with a sufficient epithelial component with pathologic homogeneity, for downstream sequencing. Selecting the optimum areas for DNA extraction is essential, as the goal of this project is to identify tumor specific genetic altera tions that are associated with treatment response. That being said, frozen tissue has been procured and can be utilized if needed. Aim 2: We will perform bioinformatics analysis to identify significant differential mutations and genetic alterations in pat ient transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) samples, and dissect the molecular pathways associated with response and resistance to BCG in the setting of non-MIBC, and cisplatin -based chemotherapy in the setting of MIBC. Progress to date: We h ave purchased the supplies to perform DNA extraction from the 16 patients selected through Pathology review by Dr. Warrick. DNA extraction will be performed in Dr. DeGraff's laboratory and quality control will be performed by the IPM prior to library prep aration. Aim 3: We will determine if alterations in the exonic sequence of a panel of specific genes significantly correlate with therapeutic resistance and/or progression in TURBT specimens. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E. Report Pennsylvania State University - 2014 Formula Grant Page 9 Progress to date : 1. NGS sequencing: The original proposal involved the use of whole exome sequencing to identify differences in the mutational landscape that were associated with the response of bladder cancer patients to treatment. Because of the magnitude of data that would be generated by whole exome sequencing following study initiation, significant concerns arose regarding the ability of this approach to identify robust predictors of clinical response based on a relatively small patient population. Because Aim 3 originally proposed t o perform focused analysis on the identification of mutational predictors in genes identified by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) study of bladder cancer, we have decided to use a gene panel based on the original genes proposed in Aim 3, and expanded to incl ude several other genes. 2. Capture panel creation: A capture panel targeting the coding regions of approximately 500 genes was constructed ( http://www.nimblegen.com/nimbledesign/ ), in order to increase depth of coverage of genes of interest and allow a mor e focused analysis. Gene selection was based on several factors, and included genes identified by MutSig analysis (https://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/mutsig ) of the most significantly mutated genes in muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma in the TCGA data set, infrequently mutated genes in commonly mutated pathways in urothelial carcinoma per the TCGA data set, genes commonly involved in copy number alterations in urothelial carcinoma, and significantly mutated genes in squamous cell carcinoma. This l atter category was chosen based on recently identified genetic similarity between urothelial carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Mutations in genes involved in DNA repair have been shown to predict response to chemotherapy, and a set of such genes was t hus included in the capture panel. This panel will enable us to interrogate the mutational profile of several genes implicated in human bladder cancer. Once we confirm our ability to extract high quality DNA from clinical samples as outlined in Aim 2 pr ogress, this panel will be ordered for our studies. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E.

Obesity i s also linked to hepatosteatosis, which can lead to hepatocarcinogenesis and liver failure. We and others recent ly established intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) as a major regulator of diet -induced obesity.

We propose a study to better understand Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Elimination (ADME) of this agent before starting a phase 1 trial in human s Anticipated Duration of Project 4/1/2015 - 6/30/2016 Project Overview Obesity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide and is associated with chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, hepatosteatosis, and cancer. We and others recently established intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) as a major regulator of diet - induced obesity. Our study demonstrated a direct biochemical link between the gut microbiota, nuclear receptor signaling, and metabolic disorders. In addition, the agent to be studied improves insulin resistance, glucose toleranc e, and reverses and/or prevents the development of fat. The specific aim of this project is to identify through in vitro and in vivo approaches the key determinants and pharmacologic consequence of FXR antagonism by specific bile acids in the gut. We will prepare a non -radiolabelled and radiolabeled test agent to complete the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Elimination (ADME) studies. This will improve our basic understanding of pharmacodynamics of the te st agent and lend crucial insight into the bioavailability of the test agent as a potential therapeutic agent . We have already overcome a major technical hurdle - the chemical transformation used for the synthesis of the proposed agent - and we will use simi lar procedures for the preparation of radiolabeled compound. To understand the ADME of the test agent, we propose to study in vitro metabolic stability, metabolite profiling , half -life and decomposition products, and plasma protein binding of non - radiolab eled test agent. We also propose to study the in vivo tissue distribution and tissue specificity of radio -labeled test agent in a mouse model. The in vitro and in vivo studies proposed here will be carried out following similar procedures that we reporte d from studies in male C57Bl/6 mice. The quantification of unbound concentration will be calculated using Liquid chromatography/Mass Spectrophotometer (LC/MS). _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E.

Box 850, MC CH74 Hershey, PA 17033 -0850 PhD; Mallapa Vijay - employed by The Pennsylvania State University Expected Research Outcomes and Benefits It has been estimated that obesity alone will co st about ~$190 billion in added medical costs every year which represents almost 21% of total U.S. health care costs. Obesity is metabolically linked with type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance) an d hepatosteatosis, which can lead to liver failure. An experimental compound which is proposed here , suppresses appetite, blocks dietary fat absorption, and / or increases metaboli sm and would be ideal in the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders We hope to identify new areas for pharmacologic treatment of obesity and help solidify our understanding of the mechanisms by which the host and gut microbiome interact. The research finding from this project will bring us one step closer to initiat ing a clinical trial in human s. The PSU investigators are considering establishing a company to take the experimental agent to the next level including phase 1 and 2 clinical t rials. This includes obtaining SBIR funding to complete the GLP toxicology, GMP manufacturing, and establishing a clinical trial protocol in order to submit an investigational new drug application to the FDA. Summary of Research Completed The funding for this reporting period was activated on April 1st, 2015. Experiment 1: Synthesis of -Muricholic acid ( MCA, 9), Gly --Muricholic acid (Gly MCA, 10). -Muricholic acid, 9 was prepared by following the literature procedure with minor modification as illustrated in Fig.1. In brief, the hydroxyl group in 3 -position of methyl chenodeoxycholic acid ( 2) was protected with ethyl chloroformate to give carbonate 3. Compound 3 oxidized with potassium chromate gave ketone 4 in good yield. Bromination with 47% HBr solution gave bromo compound 5, which on reduction with NaBH 4 gave key intermediate, bromohydrin 6 in moderate yield. Reductive dehydrobromination with zinc metal provide d olefin 7 in good yield. Oxidation with osmium tetroxide gave cis diol 8 followed by hydrolysis provided MCA ( 9). The structure of MCA was confirmed by proton NMR, and by MS analysis. A suspension of _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E. Report Pennsylvania State University - 2014 Formula Grant Page 12 ethyl glycinate was reacted with MCA ( 9) in the p resence of EEDQ. The residue obtained after usual workup and purification was dissolved in boiling ethanol and hydrolyzed with 10% K 2CO 3. The aqueous solution was acidified to give Gly MCA ( 10) as a white powder in 74% yield. The structure of Gly MCA was confirmed by proton NMR, and by MS. We have prepared GlyMCA (1g) to be used in Experiment 2. Experiment 2. Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Elimination (ADME) studies of unlabeled GlyMCA was initiated to provide information for the characteri zation based on their properties - before clinical phase in human are carried out. These studies will give us an important information regarding the molecule after its administration in to the body, i.e. how fast and in what proportion it reaches the bloo d circulation, how much and when the maximum concentration of the drug in blood is reached; which organs it enters in the body; via which route and how fast it is eliminated and how it is metabolized by the enzymes present in liver and some other organs as well. To understand the ADME of Gly MCA, we have initiated the following study. Decomposition products of Gly MCA. Half-life and decomposition products of non - radiolabeled Gly MCA will be identified using established protocols. Briefly, Gly BMCA concentration in control buffer will be quantified using a liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry assay. A standard solution of Gly MCA was prepared by dissolving 0.91mg/1.82mL of THF (0.5mg/mL; 0.5 g/L). Buffer (600 L) was treated with 60 L of GlyMCA standard solution. An aliquot (50 l) was removed immediately and stored at -80\u00b0C for analysis by MS/MS (0 minute time point). The remainder of the solution was incubated at 37C. Fifty l aliquot was collected at T=0, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes and stored at -80\u00b0C for analysis by MS/MS. The area under the concentration curve (AUC) will be determined by injecting 1 L of sample using an ACQUITY UPLC BEH (C18, 1.7 \u00b5m) column and a solvent system of water and methanol on a Shimadzu Prominence UPLC sys tem coupled with an ABSciex 5600 TripleTOF -MS system. A linear plot of the compound peak area remaining at each time point versus minutes will be generated to determine the half -life of decomposition (Dt1/2). The outcome of this assay will provide informa tion regarding the stability of the compounds. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E.

From these identified mutat ions, we will determine the number and type of potential targets created that can be recognized by T lymphocytes capable of destroying the cancer cells. This knowledge will be used to identify predictors associated with clinical response to immune -based an d standard cancer therapies in order to improve success rates and reduce treatment costs associated with therapies that are unlikely to benefit individual patients. Anticipated Duration of Project 6/1/2015 - 6/30/2016 Project Overview Melanoma comprises only 2% of all skin cancers, but it is by far the most deadly form. Approximately 76,000 new cases of invasive melanoma are expected to be diagnosed in 2014 with 1 in 50 Americans at risk for developing melanoma during their lifetime. Metastatic melanoma has a very poor prognosis with only a 10 -15% 5 -year survival rate. Clinical trials indicate that the immune system can be effectively recruited to treat widespread gross metastases with therapies targeting cytotoxic T cells showing part icular success. Recently, several studies using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) have revealed that T lymphocytes isolated from patients that experienced dramatic tumor regressions following immune therapy recognize tumor -specific antigens derived from so matic point mutations. Defining somatic mutations in cancer patients may identify potential immunogenic targets that serve as indicators for patient response to immune -based therapies. Thus, the hypothesis driving this project is that patients with increas ed numbers of somatic mutations that create novel T cell determinants in their cancer will have a higher likelihood of developing durable responses following immune therapy with or without additional therapies. Two specific aims will address this hypothesi s. Specific Aim 1: Identify cancer -specific somatic point mutations and their relationship to patient response using next generation whole exome sequencing. DNA will be extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor samples from at least 30 patien ts who show either no response to therapy or response to therapy. Bioinformatics will be used to identify and quantify patient -specific mutations that occur in the tumor. Patient response rates will be correlated with number and types of mutations identi fied. Specific Aim 2: Define the relationship between patient response and the frequency of predicted T cell epitopes. Those mutations that result in amino acid changes will be evaluated for their potential to create novel T cell epitopes using available MHC -binding prediction algorithms. Patient response rates will be correlated with number and types of predicted T cell epitopes . _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E.

Helm, MD - employed by Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center Expected Research Outcomes and Benefits The identification of patients with unique antigenic targets due to somatic mutations at sites that create novel T cell epitopes can be used to test the hypothesis of increased responsiveness toward immune -based therapies. Since immune thera pies are typically very costly (e .g., Ipilimumab ($120,000), high dose IL -2), this approach may identify those patients most likely to benefit. Identifying those patients most likely to respond may also reduce the number of different therapies that are at tempted before a response is observed, dramatically reducing treatment costs, but more importantly, directing patients to the most appropriate therapy. Furthermore, there is some evidence that epigenetic -based therapy administration may be able to induce expression of some of these mutations to further boost immune responsiveness when given prior to immune therapies, expanding the eligible patient population.

However, there is growing evidence suggesting that RYGB may lead to increased alcohol use whereas the underlying mechanism remains unknown . Our preliminary data in a rat model of RYGB suggests a key role for the gut-brain peptide ghrelin . This project will use rats and molecular, electrophysiological, behavioral methods, which cannot be used in human subjects, to test the role of ghrelin as potential pharmacological target for the development of effective treatment for alcoholism in general, and to reduce risk of alcohol use disorder after RYGB . Anticipated Duration of Project 1/1/2015 - 12/31/2015 Project Overview Obesity and its associa ted health consequences are among the main causes of preventable death. At present, RYGB surgery is one of the most effective methods of achieving significant, long - term weight loss. However, there is growing evidence suggesting that RYGB may lead to incre ased alcohol use. The ultimate neural mechanisms underlying how RYGB may increase and sustain motivation for alcohol use warrants investigation. Our research groups have recently found increased alcohol preference and intake in obese rats that underwent RY GB, a finding that parallels observations in RYGB patients. Furthermore, our preliminary data in RYGB rats suggests a key role for the orexigenic gut peptide ghrelin, which has been proposed to facilitate alcohol intake. This pre -clinical, proof -of-concept pilot project will use our RYGB high fat diet - induced obese rat model and molecular, electrophysiological methods to test the hypothesis that RYGB increases ghrelin signaling in the brain reward areas and in turn enhances motivation for consuming alcohol. Two aims address different components of this hypothesis. Aim 1 will investigate the effect of RYGB surgery on ghrelin signaling. The related experiments will assess plasma concentrations of total and active (acetylated) ghrelin (Experiment 1), and the expression of the ghrelin receptor GHS -R1A gene (Ghsr) mRNA using QRT -PCR in samples from brain areas related to reward including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (Experiment 2). Aim 2 will investigate if the NAc represents a critical site for ghrelin's action to modulate reward processes. The related experiment will demonstrate that GHS -R1A is present and functionally active in the NAc using whole -cell patch clamp recording (Experiment 3). The data generated from this project will serve as a platform for futur e projects to explore potential pharmacological targets for the development of effective treatment for alcoholism in general, and to reduce risk of alcohol use disorder in the large number of patients who have or will receive RYGB surgery. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E.

The least understood effects include altered brain functions following bariatric surgery. We anticipate that the project will resolve the conundrum of how an overall increased reward - sensitivity after RYGB could have both beneficial and adverse behavioral effects. Specifically, the concept th at ghrelin could potentially restore dopamine signaling impaired by metabolic/hormonal factors secondary to obesity is novel , and the successful outcome of the proposed research is of high impact . In this context, the proposed work will provide us with information on synaptic changes in the nucleus accumbens reward/aversion systems as well as the contribution of ghrelin which, in turn, may guide future investigations into specific pharmacological targets to treat obesity and alcohol use disorder. Overall, t his research will improve our understanding of factors that may positively or negatively influence long -term weight maintenance, and in turn, could elucidate new targets for developing less invasive treatments for obesity and for food or drug addictions. I nformation concerning essential changes in motivated behavior and underlying neural substrates produced by RYGB could assist in the development of effective non -surgical approaches. Summary of Research Completed The funding was awarded in the end of Janu ary and has been used to cover partial salary of research personnel. Unfortunately, the research technician primarily assigned to the project has left the lab on March 15 with a short notice. Temporary replacement started in June. This resulted in a setbac k in meeting the projected timelines of the project. Nevertheless, despite the very short time we have had for actual experiments, we can report on some progress with experiments related to Specific Aim 1 as outlined below. We have performed gastric bypa ss (n=6) and control (n=6) surgeries to address Specific Aim 1 to investigate the effect of RYGB surgery on ghrelin signaling at the periphery and in the brain. The related experiments were designed to assess plasma concentrations of total and active _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E. Report Pennsylvania State University - 2014 Formula Grant Page 18 (acetylated) ghrelin (Experiment 1), and the expression of the ghrelin receptor GHS -R1A gene (Ghsr) mRNA using QRT -PCR in samples from brain areas related to reward (Experiment 2). To determine time -point for plasma sampling, we measured body weight daily - critical information with respect to the efficiency of the gastric bypass surgery. Fig. 1 shows that whereas both surgical groups lost significant body weight over the first 15 days following their surgeries, it took a longer time to achieve significant dif ference between rats that received gastric bypass (RYGB) and those rats that received control ('Sham') surgery. In fact, on postoperative day 60, we observed a significant difference (p<0.0195, Fig 1) due to a slow recovery of the controls and the stabiliz ed lower weight of the RYGB rats. At this point we tested alcohol preference for low concentrations (2 -8%) alcohol (v/v/% ethanol in water) solutions which we earlier had found the RYGB rats prefer over control obese rats. As it is depicted in Figure 2, we did see significantly greater alcohol intake for the lowest concentrations tested (2 and 4 %) when computed daily (24h) intake of alcohol (normalized to body weight, and expressed as g/kg). We did not find any difference for higher concentrations. The r eason for this discrepancy with the previous study may be due to the access schedule, i.e. in the current study we only tested alcohol intake for 3 days instead of 5 -7 in the previous study. Initial aversion may occur on day one or two when an animal recei ves a higher concentration of alcohol. Regardless of the differences, the present findings did show an increased alcohol preference in the RYGB rats. Therefore we proceeded with taking blood samples from the tail vein and sent samples out to a collaborator for plasma ghrelin assays at the University of Rhode Island. Unfortunately, the results came back inconclusive due to suspected sample preparation issues. Having learned from this experience, we now are planning to repeat the experiment in a new batch of rats. (The rationale for using a whole new batch is that while waiting for the blood sample results the rats have grown older and they already had alcohol exposure.) At the end of the experiment, we have collected the brains from each rat for rtPCR analysis on the ghrelin receptor (GHSR -1A) expression (Specific Aim 1, Experiment 2). We will run the actual assays together with samples from the second batch of animals. Surgeries in a third batch of rats will be scheduled later this year to start investigation on Specific Aim 2. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E.

Report Pennsylvania State University - 2014 Formula Grant Page 20 Research Project 7 : Project Title and Purpose Diabetes -Induced Alterations in Translational Control Mechanisms in the Liver - The purpose of the project is to characterize translational control mechanisms and protein expression patterns that undergo acute variation in response to Type 1 diabetes. Contrary to the view that gene expression is primarily regulated at the level of transcription, we now know that this accounts for only about 40% of variation in protein expression. Instead, control of mRNA translation is now known to contribute more than 50% to variation in protein expression. Our preliminary studies show that diabetes -induced hyperglycemia leads to alterations in key components of the translational machinery. By characterizing these alterations, the project will yield insight into identifying targets for preventing diabetes -induced defects in liver functi on. Anticipated Duration of Project 4/1/2015 - 6/30/2016 Project Overview Diabetes and its associated hyperglycemia induce multiple changes in liver function, yet we know little about the underlying mechanisms. In the liver, diabetes -induced hyperglyc emia increases the flux of glucose through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway to increase production of uridine diphosphate N -Acetylglucosamine, which promotes protein O - GlcNAcylation of proteins, influencing their function by altering subcellular localiz ation, protein -protein interactions, DNA binding, enzyme activity, and turnover rates. Proteins modified by O -GlcNAcylation include those involved in mRNA translation. Understanding the role of mRNA translation in liver function is important because we n ow know that translation contributes more than 50% to variation in protein expression. Recently we showed that diabetes - induced hyperglycemia mediates a shift from cap -dependent to cap -independent mRNA translation in the liver. The shift was related to O -GlcNAcylation of a repressor of the mRNA 4E -binding protein 1 (4E -BP1), and did not occur in the absence of the protein. Selection of mRNAs for translation is governed by a multiple protein complex referred to as eIF4F w hich is composed of eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A. Assembly of the eIF4F complex is governed in turn by 4E -BP1 and PDCD4. Therefore, the broad objectives of the research project are to gain an understanding of diabetes -induced global changes in protein express ion patterns mediated by translational control mechanisms, as well as O -GlcNAcylation patterns of proteins involved in assembly of the eIF4F complex. The broad objectives will be accomplished by pursuing the following Specific Aims : (1) Characterize the effects of diabetes on gene expression patterns in the liver through the use of the ribosome profiling approach for comprehensive and quantitative analysis of in vivo mRNA translation; (2) Identify diabetes - induced changes in O -GlcNAcylation of 4E -BP1 and translation initiation factors comprising the eIF4F complex. Aim 1 studies will employ the new technique of ribosome profiling to identify the mRNAs that are being translated in the liver of control, diabetic, and phlorizin -treated diabetic rats. Aim 2 studies will use the same livers to identify O -GlcNAcylation sites in 4E - BP1, eIF4G, site mutagenesis. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E.

Salzberg, MS - employed by Penn State College of Medicine Expected Research Outcomes and Benefits Expected outcomes of the research project include identification of mRNAs that are translationally up - or down -regulated in response to diabetes -induced hype rglycemia. Additionally, the project should provide evide nce to suggest possible mechanisms through which mRNA translation is controlled, e.g. through uORFs, alternative start site selection, or ribosomal pausing. The project is also expected to identify not only the residues on 4E -BP1, eIF4A, eIF4G, and PDCD4 that are modified by O -GlcNAcylation, but also the mechanism through which O - GlcNAcylation of these factors alters eIF4F complex assembly. The benefit of this information is that it will be invaluable in defining the mechanism(s) involved in the modulatio n of mRNA translation that occurs in response to diabetes -induced hyperglycemia, and will likely provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Summary of Research Completed Our current efforts are directed toward accomplishing the studies described in Specific Aim 1 in the original application. The primary focus will be on using ribosome profiling (a.k.a. Riboseq analysis) to globally c haracterize the effects of diabetes on in vivo patterns of mRNA translation in the liver. Work accomplished to da te. Since the start of the project in April, we have focused our efforts in two areas. The first area involves generation of a group of diabetic mice. We purchased 12 mice and randomly divided them into two groups. One group was administered streptozot ocin (STZ; to induce diabetes) and the other vehicle by intraperitoneal injection. Recent blood glucose measurements indicate that all of the mice administered STZ have become diabetic, as determined by nonfasting blood glucose concentrations >400 mg/dl. In approximately two weeks, livers from the control and diabetic mice will be removed for ribosome profiling analysis. Second, because almost all of the previously published studies have used cells in culture for ribosome profile analysis, we have begun to optimize the procedure for mouse liver. The first step of the analysis involves isolating ribosome -protected mRNA fragments. To accomplish this, the liver was removed from a control (i.e. non -diabetic) mouse, immediately homogenized in ice -_________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E. Report Pennsylvania State University - 2014 Formula Grant Page 22 cold buffer containing cycloheximide, and then centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 10 min at 4C. The absorbance of the supernatant at 260 nm was recorded, and aliquots corresponding to 50 A260 units were incubated with various amounts of TruSeq Ribo Profile Nuclease at room temperature for 60 min. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged through MicroSpin 400 columns and RNA was extracted from the eluates. The digests were then subjected to electrophoresis through a 15% urea -polyacrylamide gel. As outlined by the red box in Fig. 1, ribosome -protected mRNA fragments were detected at each nuclease concentration tested, but the optimal amount was determined to be 5 units. The isolated ribosome -protected mRNA fragments were then used to generate a library using a kit fro m Illumina. First, ribosomal RNA was removed from the mRNA fragments using a Ribo -Zero kit according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The mRNA fragments were then subjected to end repair using TruSeq Ribo Profile Polynucleotide Kinase by incubation hr. TruSeq Profile 3 Adapters were added to the 3' of the mRNA fragments using Truseq Ribo Profile Ligase followed by reverse transcription using EpiScript reverse transcriptase according to the instructions provided by Illumina. Following PAGE purification, DNA was circularized using TruSeq Ribo Profile CircLigase, amplified by PCR, and then purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads. The size distribution of the library (140 -160 bp) was confirmed by PAGE. The library was sent to the Genomics Core Facility at the Penn State College of Medicine, and Dr. Yuka Imumura subjected it to RNA sequencing. A total of 10,437,038 reads were obtained, and after removing reads that were too short, non -clipped, or adapter only, 8,663 ,673 reads remained. Not surprisingly, ribosome -protected sequences from liver specific (e.g. albumin) as well as non -specific (e.g. ribosomal protein) mRNAs were detected. For example, the distribution of ribosome protected fragments for the albumin mRN A are shown in Fig. 2. As shown in the figure, thousands of ribosome protected fragments were detected across the coding region of the mRNA, beginning in the first exon that contains the AUG start codon for translation and ending in the penultimate codon that contains the stop codon. Figure 1. Urea -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of ribosome - protected mRNA fragments from rat liver. Supernatant was prepared from a rat liver as described in the text and then treated with 0 (lane 2), 1 (lane 3), 2.5 (lane 4), 5 (lane 5), or 7.5 (lane 6) units of TruSeq Ribo Profile Nuclease . An RNA control (lane 8) and size standards (lanes 1 and 7) were resolved on the same gel. The area enclosed by the red box in lane 5 was used for further analysis as described i n the paragraph above. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E.

This project will explore the influence of male and female sex hormones on a key process in the initiation of antibody response and on the molecular affinity of antibodies produced by women vs. men . We seek to identify hormonally -regulated processes that could serve as therapeutic targets to augment vaccine responses or to attenuate pathologic autoantibody production. Anticipated Duration of Project 1/1/2015 - 6/30/2016 Project Overview The immunoglobulin heavy chain gene in activated B cells undergoes recombination events that result in a switch in the class of immunoglobulin produced by the B cell. Under the same activating conditions the variable regions of both immunoglobulin heavy an d light chain genes acquire numerous somatic mutations \u2014allowing for the emergence of high affinity antibodies. These processes of Class Switch Recombination (CSR) and Somatic Hypermutation (SHM) are both driven (AI CDA), a DNA modifying enzyme that has now been recognized in vitro to be regulated by gonadal steroid hormones. We propose to test the hypothesis that the recognized sexual dimorphism of human humoral immune responses might be, at least in part, the conse quence of hormonal modulation of processes initiated by AICDA. We propose to establish critical methodologies for this assessment and to establish whether sexual dimorphism and/or hormonal modulation of these events at the molecular level suggest critical checkpoints for gonadal hormone action during B cell development or activation. Specific Aim 1 : We propose to test the hypothesis that the gonadal steroids in vitro alter the targeting of AICDA or its required cofactor Replication Protein A (RPA) to geno mic sites of action involved in CSR and SHM in activated human B cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation - deep sequencing (ChIP -seq) will be used to analyze targets of AICDA and RPA in genomic DNA from human B cells activated in vitro with interleukin 4 and CD 40 ligand under control conditions and in the presence of physiologic concentrations of dihydrotestosterone or estradiol. Specific Aim 2 : We propose to test the hypothesis that gonadal steroids might alter qualitative or quantitative aspects of somatic hy permutation in human B cells activated during immunization in vivo, and that this might be reflected in altered affinity of expressed antibodies for the immunogen. Antibody secreting cells that arise in response to influenza immunization in men and women will be flow sorted to allow single cell PCR amplification of expressed immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain genes. These PCR products will be cloned, expressed, and analyzed for their affinity for the immunogen. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E.

Kovacs , MD Professor of Medicine Penn State MS Hershey Medical Center 500 University Drive Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033 Other Participating Researchers Ann L Benko, PhD - employed by Penn State MS Hershey Medical Center Expected Research Outco mes and Benefits This project will seek to identify whether differences in male and female immune responses might be controlled by hormonal differences between the sexes. We will test the hypothesis that female sex steroids enhance or male sex steroids i mpair the actions of key regulators of activation of B lymphocytes, the antibody producing cells that control humoral immune responses to vaccines as well as pathogens. To achieve this, we propose to examine whether these hormones alter the targeting of a ctivation -induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA) and Replication Protein A (RPA) on the human genome. This DNA -modifying enzymatic complex is broadly targeted in the genome of activated B cells and induces mutations that, in the case of the immunoglobulin hea vy and light chain genes, alter the specificity and affinity of the encoded antibodies. We expect to find that gonadal steroid hormones alter the quantitative or qualitative targeting of AICDA and/or RPA to genomic sites of action, and that such hormonal effects result in antibodies with differing reactivities to immunogens. The project will establish new techniques in our lab (chromatin immunoprecipitation -deep sequencing, or ChIP -Seq, and in vitro expression of human immunoglobulins produced in single c ells in response to vaccines). These studies will provide new insight into how we might augment human responses to vaccines or how we might attenuate the disordered humoral immune function observed in autoimmune diseases such as Systemic Lupus Erythematos us. The project will also provide new technical bases for future research proposals for extramural funding. Summary of Research Completed We received our Award Letter for this project on 29 May 2015 and have begun work on Specific Aim 1 \u2014to identify effe cts of gonadal steroid hormones on the genomic targeting of Activation - Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AICDA) and its essential co -regulator Replication Protein A (RPA). To perform interpretable chromatin immunoprecipitation - deep sequencing (ChIP -seq) experi ments we first needed to identify suitable antibodies with high specificity for each of these targets. Western blot characterization of two \"ChIP qualified\" antibodies is shown in figure 1. We used cellular extracts from both normal human blood periphera l B cells isolated using anti - CD19 magnetic beads and cultured human Ramos cells, a neoplastic B lymphocyte line in which SHM and CSR have been extensively studied. Ramos cells constitutively express AICDA and RPA; the normal B -lymphocytes are activated i n vitro with IL4 and anti CD40 ligand antibodies to induce expression of these proteins.

Further testing with pre -adsorption of the antibody with specific AICDA peptide will be needed to conclude that this antibody is suitable for ChIP. We have a panel of three other anti -AICDA antibodies to test. The first anti -RPA an tibody tested yielded very clean immunoblots, with only a single protein identified at the expected molecular weight of 32 kDa. We are standardizing our method for mechanical shearing of chromatin in preparation for the first ChIP assays, which will utili ze anti -RPA. There is no progress to date on Specific Aim 2. Figure 1.

Report Pennsylvania State University - 2014 Formula Grant Page 27 Research Project 9 : Project Title and Purpose Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Infertility in Men: an in vivo Model of Spermatogenesis. - Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis and sperm function will contribute to the search for treatments and prevention of male infertility and subfertility, and may also help to develop a new approach for contraception in human and other mammals. As such, the purpose of this project is to generate and characterize an in vivo model of a conditional Pramel1 -knockout (KO). This will provide a valuable new tool for the advanced study of PRAME in spermatogenesis, particularly the stage -specific deletion of PRAME will provide novel insights into molecular mechanisms that regulate a crosome formation and sperm morphogenesis, two key steps in the formation of viable and productive sperm. Anticipated Duration of Project 5/15/2015 - 12/31/2016 Project Overview Subfertility and infertility are significant problems in men, which are ma inly caused by a reduced sperm concentration, decreased motility and abnormal morphology. A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis will help us to address issues related to male infertility/subfertility. The prefere ntially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME) protein belongs to a group of cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) that are predominantly expressed in normal testis and a variety of tumors. Members of the PRAME gene family encode leucine -rich repeat (LRR) proteins that fold into a horseshoe shape, which provides a versatile structural framework for the formation of protein -protein interactions in diverse molecular recognition processes. Although PRAME is known to play a regulatory role in cancer cells , the function of PRAME in germ cells remains unknown. The objective of this project is to determine the role of PRAME during spermatogenesis by generating and characterizing a conditional PRAME mutant. Our central hypothesis is that the PRAME protein interacts with protein phosphatase 12 (PP12) through its LRR domains, and plays essential role(s) in acrosome biogenesis and sperm function. This hypothesis is well supported by our preliminary results obtained in humans, mice, and cattle . Furthermore, our recent in vitro study revealed that PRAME interacts with PP12, a protein that is already known to be involved in germ cell development and sperm motility . We will test our central hypothesis and accomplish our objective by pursuing the following two specific aims u sing the mouse Prame -like 1 (Pramel1 ) as a representative of the PRAME gene family: Aim 1 . Generate an in vivo model - a conditional Pramel1 -knockout (KO) mouse; Aim 2 . Determine spermatogenesis by phenotypical, immunohistoche mical/histological and morphological analyses. This KO mouse will be used for in vivo experiments to investigate the effects of PRAMEL1 on acrosome formation, sperm function, and fertilization. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E.

We expect that a stage -specific deletion of Pramel1 will provide novel insights into molecular mechanisms that regulate acrosom e formation, sperm morphogenesis and sperm motility, all of which have been directly related to male infertility and subfertility. This project involves knocking -out a novel spermatid/spermatozoa -specific protein (PRAMEL1), and investigating the role of th is protein during spermatogenesis.

Report Pennsylvania State University - 2014 Formula Grant Page 29 Research Project 1 0: Project Title and Purpose FXR and the Gut Microbiota as Modulators of Obesity - Recently published data from our group and o thers strongly suggests that not only is farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonism important for the anti -obesity effects observed with tempol treatment or bariatric surgery but it also likely serves as a conduit by which the gut microbiome regulates and manipulates the host environment. These signals are likely through modification of bile acid pools and in particular through the deconjugation of bile acids such as tauro muricholic acid and glycine muricholic acid. Howeve r, how these compounds impact the microbiome and alter its metabolism and that of the host remains to be determined. Harnessing these changes to promote health is the focus of this project. Anticipated Duration of Project 5/29/2015 - 6/30/2017 Project Overview Our central hypothesis is that functionally significant changes (i.e., transcriptional, metabolic) in the gut microbiome results in altered agonism/antagonism of intestinal FXR that promotes a state of anti -obesity. Specific Aim: To determine the impact and specificity of FXR antagonism on the prevention and/or amelioration of obesity. Experiment 1 : Determine how genetic and chemical antagonism of FXR impacts the microbiome in mice. This experiment is critical to our establishment that, in th e presence of an FXR antagonist or in the absence or presence of FXR through targeted disruption of FXR in the liver or intestine, a functional change in the gut microbiome can be measured including changes in the gut microbiome metabolites and its transcr iptional profile. Experiment 2 : Determine how monocolonization with Lactobacillus johnsonnii (wild -type and bile salt hydrolase mutants) influences FXR expression using germ free mice. Using germ free mice, we wish to explore the novel concept that the gu t microbiome specifically alters the host environment through modulation of FXR signaling. Experiment 3 : Determine how genetic and chemical antagonism of FXR impacts diet -induced obesity. Our recent publications strongly support that FXR antagonism promo tes weight loss in mice on a high fat diet. However, we have not yet established the specificity of this effect using the appropriate mouse models, specifically how intestinal and liver specific ablation of Fxr modulates diet -induced obesity. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Pennsylvania Department of Health - 2014 -2015 Annual C.U.R.E.

Smith, PhD; Emmanuel Hatzakis, PhD; Istvan Albert, PhD - employed by The Pennsylvania State University Expected Research Outcomes and Benefits The scientific and medical community is increasingly appreciative of the important role that bile acids play in the host -microbiome axis. Bile acids not only serve to aid in the digestion and absorption of dietary fat and fat soluble vitamins but have been recently identified as potent signaling molecules that are modulated by the gut microbiome to profoundly impact many metabolic disorders including obesity. Recent evidence in both mouse models of diet -induced obesity and humans undergoing bariatric weight loss surgery suggests that the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a member of the nuclear receptor super family, is a central regulator of these anti-obesity effects and that bile acids pools and enterohepatic circulation are altered through FXR antagonism. In this project, we plan to address the fundamental gap in knowledge with respect to FXR antagonism and obesity. Through the innovative use of cutting -edge techniques \u2014including metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics \u2014and unique mouse models and s amples from bariatric patients, we plan to identify the functional changes imparted to the gut microbiome and host following intestinal FXR antagonism. This combination of approaches will allow us to identify new therapeutic FXR antagonists and to accurate ly assess how these compounds influence bacterial phyla dynamics with the ultimate goal of developing new obesity therapies. Summary of Research Completed We have just initiated the project and are planning to commence once several of the bacteria and transgenic bacteria are created. However, to support out project we have purchased a Seahorse XFe24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer to help profile changes in cellular metabolism in support of our other metabolism work using metabolomics approaches. We have just completed training on this platform and will start utilizing its capabilities for both human and bacterial metabolism. "}
