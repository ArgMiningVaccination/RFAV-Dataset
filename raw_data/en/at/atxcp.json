The field of PIM has evolved over the past 25 years, approaching child health with a number of guiding principles: preventive, context-centered, relationship-based, personalized, participatory, and ecologically sustainable. This manuscript reviews important time points for the field of PIM and reports on a series of meetings of PIM leaders, aimed at assessing the state of the field and planning for its future. Efforts in the first decade of the 2000s led to increased visibility in academic and professional pediatric organizations and through international listservs, designed to link those interested in and practicing PIM, all of which continue to flourish. The PIM leadership summits in recent years resulted in specific goals to advance PIM further in the following key areas: research, clinical practice, professional education, patient and family education, and advocacy and partnerships. Additionally, goals were developed for greater expansion of PIM professional education, broader support for pediatric PIM research, and an expanded role for PIM approaches in the provision of pediatric care.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2018-08-20", "cleaned_text": "Pediatric Integrative Medicine: Vision for the Future [3](#B3-children-05-00111), [4](#B4-children-05-00111)]. Chronic health conditions contribute to the global burden of disability [ [5](#B5-children-05-00111)]. Historically, the conventional solution has favored a 'disease-treatment system' that often incentivizes more invasive care at higher cost, an approach poorly aligned with the needs of today's children. Health care transformation is no longer optional; it is an absolute imperative. Advocates and stakeholders in search of better health care require new approaches to meet the complex health challenges faced by children. We are searching for safer and more cost-effective paradigms to optimize the health and well-being of children everywhere. Multidisciplinary healthcare models that implement integrative and complementary therapies for patients with chronic illness have shown improved clinical outcomes and quality of life [ [6](#B6-children-05-00111), [7](#B7-children-05-00111)]. In addition, health outcomes are improved through patient empowerment [ [8](#B8-children-05-00111), [9](#B9-children-05-00111)]. Integrative medicine promotes relationship-centered care and empowers individuals to incorporate wellness strategies such as improving nutrition, physical activity, and sleep hygiene. [10](#B10-children-05-00111)] (p. 214). - Preventive: True primary care pediatrics is proactive rather than reactive. Prescribing lifestyle solutions to prevent disease is generally preferable to costly and potentially risky treatments. Lifestyle prescriptions may include food, activity, nature, creativity, rest, mindfulness, and connection with others. - Context-centered: Children must be nurtured within the context of healthy families, communities, and schools. Health in mind, body, and spirit depends on how suitable the environment is for the child. - Relationship-based: Only through open communication and building trust are we best able to work together to ensure each child's optimal health. The connection between health professionals and families has its own healing potential. - Personalized: Health is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. Each child carries a unique potential based on a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. There is no medical treatment that can be guaranteed as safe for 100% of any population. Each family has the inherent right to make health care decisions for their children, keeping in mind the best interests of the child as well as legitimate public health concerns that ethically inform these decisions. - Participatory: Creating health should be a collaborative process, actively encouraging participation and putting children and families back in control of their own health. Patient-centered care creates hope and empowers families to make sustainable changes, inspiring children to create the future they deserve. - Ecologically sustainable: How we practice healthcare affects the environment, which has a measurable and cyclical impact on our health. The health and well-being of all the Earth's inhabitants are intimately tied to the health of our planet. - Evidence-informed: Therapies that are evidence-informed while using the safety-effectiveness rubric ( [Figure 1](#children-05-00111-f001)) are considered as part of the treatment plan. 2. Background [12](#B12-children-05-00111)]. Use of these therapies in pediatrics is significant, as the 2012 National Health Interview Survey revealed that 12% of children use complementary therapies [ [13](#B13-children-05-00111)]. Studies in specific chronically ill populations have reported complementary therapy use in up to 80% of study participants [ [14](#B14-children-05-00111), [15](#B15-children-05-00111)]. We use the term \"complementary\" specifically to delineate these therapies from those offered within conventional Western medical care systems. PIM, by definition, embodies the integration of complementary therapies with conventional pediatric health care in a way that is informed by best available evidence and centered on the individual patient and family. Truly effective and safe patient-centered care demands that we talk with our patients about therapies of interest to them and know where to find evidence to inform these conversations. [12](#B12-children-05-00111)]. In a national survey sent to members of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), most pediatric healthcare professionals (87%) had been asked about complementary and alternative (CAM) therapies by a patient/parent within three months of the survey [ [16](#B16-children-05-00111)]. In addition, over 80% of the pediatric healthcare professionals desired additional information on CAM, with fewer than 5% reporting being knowledgeable about individual CAM therapies [ [16](#B16-children-05-00111)]. Of the whether or not professionals 'believe' in these therapies is immaterial; patient-centered care and patient safety demand that professionals know what health approaches are being used and considered. Health professionals must remember that evidence-informed medicine is a triad: best available evidence, clinical experience, and patient preference [ [17](#B17-children-05-00111)]. Dr. Kathi Kemper and Mr. Cohen, JD, MBA, MFA published a now well-established rubric to evaluate the use of therapies [ [18](#B18-children-05-00111)], see [Figure 1](#children-05-00111-f001). [19](#B19-children-05-00111), [20](#B20-children-05-00111)]. The PIM Leadership Initiative (PIMLI) has developed this position statement to provide a unified vision for PIM to meet the needs of professionals in the service of pediatric patients and families. As PIM is still growing, although 20 years old, providing structure and vision is imperative for the continued, sustainable development of the field. 3.

Survey Summary [Figure 2](#children-05-00111-f002)) was created from stakeholder comments about what integrative medicine meant to them (unpublished data). 4.2. Parent Survey Summary [https://momsmeet.com](https://momsmeet.com), unpublished data) answered questions regarding their knowledge of PIM, PIM therapies they'd like to see offered in pediatric practices, and their willingness to advocate for insurance coverage of PIM therapies. Of note, even in this sample of natural health oriented parents, nearly one in four respondents were not familiar with IM. Fewer than one in seven definitively consider their pediatrician integrative while approximately 60% of parents believe having an integrative pediatrician for their children is important. Information about therapies is most commonly found online, and the two most desired in-office therapies are nutritional counseling and behavioral/mental health services. Key survey findings are shown in [Figure 3](#children-05-00111-f003)a-d below. 4.3. 2015 PIMLI Summit Summary [23](#B23-children-05-00111)]. Small groups were tasked with describing the existing gaps for each domain with specific strategies to address those gaps. The whole group then worked to clarify gaps and strategies to identify realistic and specific action steps to address each domain. - Expand the AAP Section on Integrative Medicine research and education grant program. - Explore the development of a multi-center PIM research network. - Publish PIM research articles in mainstream academic journals. - Promote use of existing quality clinical resources such as Pediatrics in Review articles, special issues in professional journals, well-designed research trials on complementary therapies, and integrative pediatrics textbooks. - Compile and distribute sample encounter forms, handouts, and smart phrases for electronic health records to support PIM clinical care. - Develop an interprofessional online clinical resource repository. - Maximize distribution and utilization of PIM residency curriculum and fellowship programs. - Facilitate a regularly occurring interprofessional conference to advance PIM education, leadership development, and to embrace and grow the PIM community. - Present PIM content at pediatric subspecialty meetings and other health professional conferences, including those targeting the underserved. - Participate in initiatives to address policy development for modern health problems such as chronic pain and opioid addiction that significantly impact children. - Develop multilingual descriptions of PIM therapies in child-friendly language. - Increase PIM content on the AAP's parent information website (healthychildren.org) by adapting existing Pediatrics in Review articles. - Develop an online video series featuring children and families discussing integrative care success stories. - Develop a robust library of PIM patient handouts for widespread use in the clinical setting. - Establish an online presence to serve as a strong independent voice advocating for PIM as mainstream pediatric healthcare, including a repository for research, clinical, and educational resources. - Partner with disease-specific organizations to spread knowledge of PIM therapies that may improve quality of life for their stakeholders. - Cultivate strong relationships with specialties also serving children, such as family medicine, medicine/pediatrics, and obstetrics/gynecology. - Work with federal and state organizations to develop and promote preventive lifestyle policies for children and families. - Contribute to resource development and advocacy efforts that support payment for PIM services and models of care. - Explore sustainable resources for philanthropy to support ongoing growth of the field. - Sustainable support for the AAP SOIM research and education grant program. - Re-printing and redistribution of the \"Talk with Your Doctor\" PIM poster ( [http://www.cpsp.cps.ca/uploads/publications/Posters-CAM.pdf](http://www.cpsp.cps.ca/uploads/publications/Posters-CAM.pdf)) to pediatricians. - Establishment of a new organization as the independent voice advocating for PIM as mainstream pediatric health care, engaging and nurturing current and future leaders of the PIM movement. 5. 2016 PIMLI Summit 2016 Professional Survey Highlights - A total 93 health professionals completed the survey. - Approximately 75% identified as pediatricians (MD/DO) with a total of 17 professional disciplines represented. - Approximately 50% had been in practice more than 20 years, and more than 80% had been in practice more than 10 years. - Over 75% stated that currently available PIM resources online are not sufficient to support their pediatric practice. - The top two most valuable current online PIM resources were the two listservs noted above; no current website was rated as valuable by more than 25% of respondents. - Membership for pediatric healthcare professionals providing specialized access to educational and community-building resources, including integrating existing interprofessional and international PIM networks (IPIM Network, PedCAM network). - Consumer and policymaker engagement via media tools and the development of short promotional videos profiling PIM \"success stories\". - Educational and Research Resource Repository, including professional presentations and a searchable PIM publication bibliography. - Continuing education online conferences and webinars. - Professional consultative service assisting the development of academic PIM centers and clinical practices. - Coordination of PIM efforts with the AAP SOIM and other reputable national/international organizations. [24](#B24-children-05-00111)]. The PIMR program consists of a 100-h online educational curriculum initially piloted in five diverse pediatric residency training programs in the United States. In 2016, the PIMR program had grown to include more than 500 residents nationally and internationally in nine residency programs. Of note, the PIMR program is specifically limited to pediatric resident physicians. The AAP SOIM sponsors PIM educational sessions each year at the AAP National Conference to a broader group of pediatricians, though these sessions are not accessible to many other PIM professional groups nor to nonmembers of the AAP. Ultimately, collaborative efforts to reinforce interactive and online curricula at various steps during training and practice may help to meet the demand for therapeutic options that are safe, effective, and aligned with patients' values. A comprehensive, accessible online professional PIM education hub would be optimally situated to meet the needs of the larger PIM community. 6. Vision for the Future - PIM exemplifies a mainstream model of comprehensive care that emphasizes a personalized, participatory, and evidence-informed approach to the whole child. - PIM emphasizes preventive health, understanding of the etiology of underlying illness, and exploration of all appropriate treatment options to optimize health and well-being. - PIM promotes a cohesive, respectful, and interprofessional team approach focused on the well-being of the child as a growing, developing individual in the context of the family. - Professionals collaborate across disciplines and geographic boundaries in advocating for the needs of patients and families from all socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. - Integrative professionals embrace self-care as a cornerstone of health. - Integrative professionals support identification of and access to reliable PIM educational, clinical, and research resources for all those interested in maximizing patient health and wellness. - Establishment of an international and interprofessional pediatric group to coordinate and advance the work of PIM in collaboration with the AAP SOIM. This two-pronged approach ultimately represents the optimal strategy to ensure the sustainable growth, evolution, and impact of PIM within the field of Pediatrics. - Medical schools, residencies, and other professional training programs teach PIM routinely and widely. - Hospitals, clinics, and academic centers promote co-located PIM services (e.g., credentialing nurses and/or other providers and staff in biofeedback, aromatherapy, clinical hypnosis, etc.). - Pediatric training programs implementing the PIMR curriculum and PIM fellowship programs experience high enrollment and active participation of alumni. - A yearly interprofessional symposium is established and brings together PIM professionals for collaborative learning. - PIM materials (e.g., description of therapies, licensing/credentialing information, clinical guidance, patient educational materials, research summaries, and updates) are compiled and hosted on an independent website for ready access by professionals, patients, and institutions. - PIM research is adequately funded to develop the science of utilization, safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of PIM therapies, and a multi-center research network is established to facilitate the acquisition of this knowledge. - Safe, effective, and cost-effective PIM therapies and health care systems receive endorsement from national organizations, hospital leadership, and other decision makers to judiciously expand PIM as appropriate.
