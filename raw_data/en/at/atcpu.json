Climate change and global warming are significant challenges that are driving companies to rapidly transform and reduce their carbon dioxide emissions. Valmet believes that technology plays a key role in mitigating climate change and global warming in the transition to a carbon neutral economy. That is why Valmet has created a comprehensive [Climate program](/about-us/sustainability/climate-program/) - Forward to a carbon neutral future, which includes ambitious CO2 emission reduction targets and concrete actions for the whole value chain. The program is aligned with the Paris Agreement 1.5\u00b0C pathway and UN Sustainable Development goals, and it continues our comprehensive sustainability work. Since 2020, Valmet have been developing its climate-related financial disclosures and implementing the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting recommendations to increase reporting of climate-related financial information. Valmet's climate-related disclosure is described around the four areas according to the TCFD recommendations: The Board of Directors is responsible for the administration and the proper organization of the operations of the Company. The Board also decides on significant matters related to strategy (including climate related issues), investments, organizational and finances and ensures that the Company has established the corporate values applied to its operations. The President and CEO guides and supervises the operations of Valmet and oversees the progress on targets set in Valmet's Sustainability agenda and related Climate program. Valmet's Sustainability360\u00ba Agenda has been approved by the Executive Team. The President and CEO oversees the progress of actions to reach Valmet's targets set in the Agenda. Valmet's Executive Team determines and monitors the Agenda and targets, as well as all related policies. Valmet's sustainability performance is reviewed annually by the Executive Team. The progress of Valmet's Sustainability360\u00ba Agenda is reported to the President and CEO quarterly and one to two times per year to the Board of Directors of Valmet. Climate-related issues are assessed and monitored widely by the organization management. Valmet is organized around five business lines and five geographical areas in addition to four corporate level functions (Finance, Marketing, Communication, Sustainability and Corporate Relations, Operational Development and Human resources). Climate-related issues are discussed in Executive Team as part of Valmet's strategy and thus all Valmet's operations. Valmet's Executive Team assists the President and CEO in the preparation of matters, such as Valmet's business plan, strategies, policies, and other operative matters of joint importance. The President and CEO acts as chairman of the Executive Team, where strategic level climate-related issues are managed. Valmet's Senior Vice President for Marketing, Communications, Sustainability and Corporate Relations is responsible for sustainability at Valmet. She is a member of Valmet's Executive Team and the Chair of Valmet's Climate Program Steering team, reporting to the President and CEO. Valmet's Climate Program Steering team is responsible for the Climate Program; follows the progress of the targets and provides status updates and guidance on governance and content quarterly. The Steering team includes two members of the Executive Team, the Vice President of Sustainability, the program part owners: Vice President of HSE, R&D and Supply Chain, and other key persons. The progress of Valmet's Climate Program is reviewed bi-annually by the Executive Team and annually by the Board of Directors. Valmet's Sustainability team is part of the Marketing, Communications, Sustainability and Corporate Relations function. The Sustainability team is responsible for coordinating and developing sustainability and related processes at the Valmet level and manages the Groupwide Sustainability Agenda and the initiatives it contains. In addition, all Valmet's corporate functions, business lines and areas are responsible for ensuring that all Groupwide initiatives are implemented to meet Valmet's sustainability goals. Valmet has tied selected sustainability topics such as health and safety and sustainable supply chain KPIs to remuneration. In 2022, Valmet's Board of Directors linked ESG targets to Valmet's Executive Team's long-term share-based incentive plan. The potential reward for the 2022-2024 performance period is based on an ESG Index with predefined targets linked to implementing Valmet's Climate Program and Sustainability Agenda, as well as targets supporting the company's long-term strategic and financial development. Sustainability is an integral part of our strategy and related Must-Wins that provide structure and focus for our strategic initiatives, decisions, and performance indicators. It is integrated in our processes through the comprehensive Sustainability Agenda and related Climate program. Our [Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda](/sustainability/sustainability-at-valmet/sustainability-agenda2/) has nine focus areas with systematic target setting, annual action plans and monitoring of progress. Valmet develops and supplies energy and environmentally efficient clean technologies that contribute to mitigating climate change. Climate change is also one of the main drivers affecting Valmet's business and strategy. The strategic importance increased in 2021, when Valmet's Board approved Valmet's Climate program, which includes long-term CO2 reduction targets for own operations, supply chain and our own technologies during use phase. Climate-related issues are relevant for the whole Board and discussed and monitored by the Board of Directors. Climate change and transition into carbon neutral economy are among the driving forces behind Valmet\u00b4s strategy. Valmet is mitigating climate change, adapting to global warming, and driving the transition of the pulp and paper industry towards carbon neutrality by enabling energy and resource-efficient, carbon neutral pulp, paper, and energy production. Valmet is the leading global developer and supplier of process technologies, automation and services for the pulp, paper, and energy industries. Valmet's technologies and services enable customers to produce their products with less energy and water, and fewer emissions, chemicals and raw materials, and to further improve flexibility in fuel source selection to replace fossil fuels with renewable ones. At Valmet, climate-related issues are integrated into key business processes including strategy, risk management, R&D, sales, project management, HR, procurement, and operational development. Climate-related issues are part of target setting, progress monitoring and reporting including financial KPI\u00b4s. Valmet continuously enhances [environmental efficiency](/about-us/sustainability/environmental-efficiency/) throughout its value chain. Our process technology, automation and services are designed to improve raw material, energy, water and chemical efficiency and reduce waste from processes. As Valmet sees transition to carbon neutral economy as an opportunity, Valmet has identified the development and expansion of low carbon and environmental efficiency technologies and services as a possibility to increase revenue. Valmet's systematic work on [Research and Development](/about-us/research-and-development/) gives a significant input to realizing this opportunity. Valmet's updated R&D technology vision for 2030 highlights the importance is the key to change climate-related risks to opportunities. Our R&D plays a key role in Valmet's Climate program ensuring we will meet our targets to improve energy efficiency and enable carbon neutral pulp and paper processes for our customers . Valmet focuses to develop environmental efficient, carbon neutral products and services in the long term to ensure our position as the preferred partner for customers. We aim to create growth by developing new technologies to replace fossil-based materials and energy with CO2 neutral options and to produce new high-value end products from fiber-based materials or waste streams. In 2022, Valmet launched a new R&D and innovation program called [Beyond Circularity](/about-us/beyond-circularity/), which improves Valmet's readiness to support the green transition in Valmet's customer industries based on the company's technology vision 2030. The project aims to further strengthen Valmet's R&D work in order to develop process technologies, automation and services for utilizing renewable materials and recycled waste and side streams. To support Valmet in achieving these ambitious project aims, Valmet will start building an ecosystem that aims to attract suppliers, universities, research institutes, startups, and customers to participate in making the green transition a reality within the pulp and paper industry. This ecosystem is expected to have more than 100 partners in 2025. Valmet plans to invest EUR 40 million in the project during the upcoming four-year period. The project is partly funded by Business Finland and is part of the \"Veturi\" initiative. Demand for carbon neutral technologies and services has impacted Valmet's strategy, products, services and offering. Valmet has a full scope [CO2 emissions reduction and environmental efficiency offering](/about-us/our-unique-offering/) that can reduce CO2 emissions while ensuring cost-efficiency. Valmet continues to invest in the development of new concepts and processes that reduces the environmental impact of the entire life cycle of its products. Read more on how we are minimizing CO2 emissions in [board and paper](/board-and-paper/sustainable-board-and-paper-production/) and [tissue](/tissue/sustainable-production/) production and how we can already today offer carbon-free [pulp](/pulp/sustainability/) and [energy](/energyproduction/energy-sustainability/) production. In addition, we see that [circular economy](/about-us/sustainability/circular-economy/) is an integral part of mitigating climate change. The fundamental idea of a circular economy is embedded in our mission: Converting renewable resources into sustainable results. We are constantly improving our processes to increase resource efficiency and aim to maximize the use of recycled materials in our technology offering. The successful management of climate-related risks and opportunities is a key element in the delivery of our strategy. Therefore Valmet has analyzed the potential impact of climate change on its operations and business environment by 2030 across the value chain, including the supply chain, own operations, and customers' use phase of Valmet's technologies. The potential long-term impacts of climate change have been analyzed through two different scenarios: in the first scenario the global warming is limited to 1.5\u00b0C and in the second scenario the global warming has reached 4\u00b0C. Read more about [Valmet's climate scenario analysis](/investors/sustainable-investment/tcfd/climate-scenario-analysis-valmets-risks-and-opportunities/). Below we have summarized the identified climate-related transition and physical risks and opportunities (see also [Sustainability risks and opportunities](/about-us/sustainability/sustainability-at-valmet/risks-and-opportunities/)). | | Transitional risks | | Financial impact | | Time horizon | | Key mitigating actions | | Regulation Stricter climate-related regulation and initiatives may change the availability and use of biomass, and increase the cost of raw materials (such as steel) and energy, result in new taxes and tariffs, and change our stakeholder's attitudes, which could impact Valmet's and its customers' operations and business environments. | | Medium - High | | Long | | Monitoring and participation to public discussion with facts, analysis and information on possibilities offered by different technologies. | | Technology If Valmet's technologies are not considered to be sustainable, their demand will decrease, access to capital might deteriorate and the cost of capital might increase in the long term.

Valmet has a systematic method to identify, assess and manage the probability and impact of climate related risks at all the stages of the value chain on a Group level and also within each reporting segments on a regular basis in short, medium and long-term. Climate-related risks related to direct operations, as well as the up/downstream are identified, assessed and responded with the same risk assessment process as other types of risks in the Group Valmet risk management. Risks management covers strategic, financial, operational and hazard risks, which includes climate-related physical and transition risks. The assessed risks are based on the [Valmet's risk profile](/globalassets/investors/governance/risk-management/valmet-risk-profile-2022.pdf) in which the company risks are listed on the headline level and covers all operations. Valmet's risk process promotes opportunities. Furthermore, it aspires to minimize the adverse impacts of strategic, financial, and operational risks and to remove or mitigate hazard risks. The line management of Valmet's businesses is operatively accountable for managing risks as part of its daily activities. Climate change and environmental risks are assessed once a year on a Group-level by Valmet\u00b4s Risk Management function. Valmet has defined targets and key performance indicators for climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process. Valmet's has set ambitious CO2 reduction targets and concrete actions for 2030 for the entire value chain. The program targets were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). More about the climate targets and actions, see [Valmet's Climate program ](/about-us/sustainability/climate-program/)and [Annual Review 2022](/globalassets/investors/reports--presentations/annual-reports/2022/valmet-annual-review-2022.pdf) p. 47-49 Valmet's greenhouse gas emissions are defined and reported according to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol guidelines. For a more comprehensive summary of Valmet's emissions and calculation methodology, see [GRI Supplement 2022](/globalassets/investors/reports--presentations/annual-reports/2022/valmet-gri-supplement-2022.pdf) p. 29. Valmet has also in place a dedicated Environmental Program, which sets targets for waste reduction and water consumption by 2025 and 2030. To manage and improve environmental efficiency in our own operations, we have had an environmental program in place since 2009, with ambitious targets for reducing energy, water, and waste. In 2022, we updated the targets and baselines of the program to 2030: Valmet monitors energy, waste and water amounts: More information, see [Annual Review 2022](/globalassets/investors/reports--presentations/annual-reports/2022/valmet-annual-review-2022.pdf) p. 51 and [GRI supplement](/globalassets/investors/reports--presentations/annual-reports/2022/valmet-gri-supplement-2022.pdf), p. 27-28 and 32. Valmet's new products and services reduce CO2 emissions, water and raw material consumption and waste, while increasing energy efficiency. Valmet monitors the market demand for more environmentally efficient technologies by monitoring the share of orders received from new products and services. Valmet's target in 2021 was to have at least 25 % of orders received coming from new products and services. More information see "}
