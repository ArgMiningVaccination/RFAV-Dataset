This book\u2014an imaginative, practical, and accessible guide to our inner organs\u2014is written for all who want to improve their health and develop resiliency against illness. Although trained as a medical doctor, Olaf Koob has the vision and experience of a holistic physician. He has surveyed diverse medical systems\u2014orthodox medicine, naturopathy, homeopathy, traditional Chinese, Ayurvedic, and anthroposophic medicine\u2014and found their common substance. Using this knowledge, he relates the essence of each human organ: its position, color, form, embryonic development, function, and characteristic attributes. Thus, the organs begin to tell their own stories, revealing their \"biographies,\" physiognomy, and the illnesses to which they are prone. Inspired by esoteric wisdom, Koob creates living images of the pancreas and the hormonal system and shows how the spleen, liver, gall bladder, heart, kidneys, lungs, and reproductive organs relate to the whole cosmos. He describes the nature of poison and detoxification, good and bad nutrition, and the importance of secretion and elimination. If the Organs Could Speak is a unique work that enables us to think more creatively about our bodies and how they function, and to help us cope with crises, suffering and pain.
