We vaccinate our children to stim- ulate immunity. We operate with sterile instru- ments to prevent infection. We educate preg - nant mothers in order to promote foetal health. As physicians we took an oath to treat our patients in the best manner possible, and we swore to \"first do no harm\". Preventing disease is still better than treating it. And that is what this report is about: choosing better alternatives in daily healthcare, in order to prevent disease further down the line. PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is a widely used plas - tic. It is often made more flexible by the use of the phthalate DEHP, long considered to have toxic characteristics. The European Union has banned the use of DEHP in toys for children under the age of 3 years (1999/815/EC). Young children tend to put toys in their mouths and DEHP leaches out of the plastics, exposing the developing child to the chemical. One of the first campaigns of HCWH Europe was to elimi- nate DEHP, the most commonly used phthalate, in intravenous drips. We've known for decades that phthalates leach out of medical devices such as tubing. Yet better alternatives were not available thirty years ago. That is no longer the case. It is then a matter of choice: do we choose better alternatives or do we choose to ignore the potential danger to the patients we are try - ing to treat? There is mounting evidence of en-docrine disruption: unintentionally influencing hormone systems is unwise. We have seen an increase in breast and testicular cancers, in thy - roid disorders, and infertility throughout Europe over the last decades. It is then alarming to note that these endocrine systems are influenced by phthalates. Similarly, bisphenol A (BPA) has been linked to endocrine disruption. This report presents the evidence in a clear and concise manner. BPA was initially developed as a synthetic oestrogen in 1891. Due to the availability of more potent synthetic oestrogens, such as thalidomide, BPA was not widely used until the second half of the twentieth century. Now it is a major part of daily life: from the ink of cash register paper to the linings of beverage cans - and in medical de - vices. Until recently BPA was also found in baby bottles. A number of years ago the American Medical Association issued a statement encouraging healthcare providers to reduce the use of prod- ucts containing PVC and DEHP, and to choose better alternatives (Res. 502, A-06). Many Eu-ropean healthcare providers have also made a conscious choice to eliminate PVC, DEHP and BPA from daily healthcare. A number of exam- ples are discussed in this report. But still not enough is being done. This is partly due to limit - ed political will. Although a number of European countries, such as Denmark and France, have taken bold steps towards elimination, European legislation is still lacking. Currently, the EU Di-rectives on medical devices are under revision and a new proposal for a regulation on medical devices is under discussion in the European in-stitutions. It would be disappointing should eco - nomic issues prevail above doing what is right: protecting our patients and preventing disease. This report presents evidence that policy makers should not ignore. The report is a plea to poli- ticians and governing bodies to adopt stringent legislation to eliminate the use of PVC, DEHP and BPA in healthcare. Legislation would stimulate healthcare providers to choose better products. What could be more important than the health of Europe's citizens? Gavin W. ten Tusscher, MD, PhD, paediatrician Westfriesgasthuis, Netherlands 6 Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices 7 Medical devices play a critical role in healthcare but may contain hazardous substances in their composition that can leach out into patients during their use, compromising patient safety. Concerns have been raised by different societal groups, including governmental bodies, health- care professionals, scientific researchers and civil society organisations, regarding the poten-tial health effects of chemical exposure through medical devices to vulnerable groups of the population. At the end of 2012, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a Reg - ulation to recast the existing Directives on medical devic - es. In its report, the Europe - an Parliament voted in favour of an amendment that would strengthen the current rules on hazardous substances in medical devices, enforcing the phase-out of these substances when safer alter - natives are available. Substances that are commonly present in med- ical devices and which are of particular concern are phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA). Phthalates are commonly used as softeners in PVC-based medical devices while BPA is used in a variety of plastics with applications in the medical device industry. One of the major reasons of concern with these substances is that they are endocrine disrupting chemicals that may interfere with the normal functioning of the endocrine system and present a hazard to different physiological and developmental processes. Health Care Without Harm Europe's mission is to transform the healthcare sector so that it is ecologically sustainable and no longer a source of harm to public health and the environment. At the same time, this must happen without Executive Summary compromising patient safety or care. This report is part of HCWH Europe's work to raise aware - ness on the presence of hazardous substances in medical devices and the risks to patients, and most importantly to promote the substitution of these substances by showing that many alterna- tives with better toxicological profiles are avail- able on the market. Change is not only possible but it is already on the way. This change is be - ing led by certain manufacturers, governments, health systems, hospitals and health practi- tioners and needs to be further encouraged and supported by political and regulatory action. HCWH Europe proposes a number of specific recommendations to promote a move towards non-toxic healthcare, minimising the hazards to patients without compromising medical care: European legislation should protect the most vulnerable groups and create the conditions to rapidly reduce or eliminate human exposure to hazardous chemicals such as phthalates and bisphenol A con-tained in medical devices; Standards for pre-market evaluation of medical devices should include more data on chemicals used in medical devices and allow a performance comparison of indi- vidual substances; The market authorisation process for med- ical devices needs increased transparency; Sustainable procurement guidelines should provide incentives for the substi- tution of hazardous chemicals in medical devices; Labelling requirements for hazardous chemicals in medical devices should be expanded; Funding for research and development of alternative substances and products and for clinical and epidemiological projects that compare the performance of these al-ternatives should be prioritised. Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices \"HCWH Europe's mission is to transform the healthcare sector so that it is ecologically sustainable and no longer a source of harm to public health and the environment.\" 8 Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices 9 Medical devices (see Box 1) are essential in healthcare, playing an important role in pre - vention, diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of diseases and disabilities. Hazardous chemi-cals are present in medical devices as additives to improve plastic performance. These addi- tives can represent a high percentage of the final product and include, among oth- ers, plasticisers, flame retardants, fillers, colourings, impact modifiers and stabi- lisers. Many of these substances can leach out of the product and have adverse effects on human health and the environment. Concerns regarding hazardous chemical expo - sure through medical devices are particularly relevant to groups of vulnerable patients that undergo multiple medical interventions or are exposed chronically over extended periods, including infants in neonatal care or dialysis patients. Substances that are commonly found in med- ical devices and are of particular concern are phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) (see Boxes 2 and 3). These substances have been the subject of an intense political debate in recent years due to their widespread use in consumer prod- ucts and the risks they pose to human health and the environment. In September 2012, the European Commission adopted a new proposal for the regulation of medical devices to recast the existing Directives on medical devices (Proposal for a Regulation Introduction of the European Parliament and of the Coun-cil on medical devices, and amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009). The Council of the European Union and the European Parlia-ment are currently debating this new propos - al. Despite the many claims that exposure to hazardous chemicals through medical devices represents a small proportion of an individual's overall exposure, the European Parliament has recognised that this exposure can be harmful for patients and should be avoided whenever possible. Therefore, the European Parliament approved an amendment to the medical de - vices proposal that calls for the phase-out of hazardous chemicals in medical devices where safer alternatives are available (1). Definition of medical device under the European Union legislation (Directive 2007/47/EC) \"...any instrument, apparatus, appliance, soft - ware, material or other article, whether used alone or in combination, together with any ac - cessories, including the software intended by its manufacturer to be used specifically for diagnos - tic and/or therapeutic purposes and necessary for its proper application, intended by the manu-facturer to be used for medical purposes for hu-man beings for the purpose of: diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury or handi-cap, investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process, control of conception, and which does not achieve its principal intend-ed action in or on the human body by pharma-cological, immunological or metabolic means, but which may be assisted in its function by such means.\"BOX 1Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices Hazards of chemicals contained in medical devices Human biomonitoring studies have detect - ed hazardous chemicals like phthalates and BPA in almost every individual analysed and in a variety of human tissues and fluids such as placental tissue, breast milk, amniotic fluid, urine, blood and saliva (2-5). One of the major reasons for concern is that phthalates and BPA are endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that can mimic or otherwise interfere with hormone production or function\u2014and as such can inter - fere with organ formation and growth, sexual maturation, stress response, behaviour, appe - tite and thirst (6). An increase in the incidence of diseases and illnesses in humans at the dif - ferent stages of life, from neonatal and infancy through to adulthood, has been associated with exposure to these substances (5, 6). As traditional risk assessment procedures lack integration of endocrinology concepts, the ef - fects of EDCs in human health and the environ- ment are mostly dismissed. In particular, effects from early life exposures, chronic low-dose ex - posures and the fact that humans are exposed to a large number of chemicals simultaneously are not taken into consideration. Researchers and healthcare practitioners are particularly concerned that exposure to these substances through medical devices adds to exposure from other sources since these com-pounds are ubiquitous and the entire popula- tion is already exposed. Moreover, vulnerable population groups, such as babies, children, pregnant and breast-feeding women and the elderly are not adequately protected from the risk of exposure to these chemicals. A precautionary approach, eliminating expo - sure to hazardous chemicals wherever possible is appropriate in the case of medical devices as the users will be primarily from these vulnera-ble populations or maybe rendered more sus - ceptible to toxic insult through illness.What are phthalates? Phthalates are a group of chemical substances, primarily used as plasticisers (softeners) in plas - tics to make them more flexible. Depending on the number of carbon atoms in their alkyl side-chains they are divided into high-chain length (e.g., DINP, DPHP and DIUP) (e.g., DEHP, DBP, DIBP and BBP) six carbons and low-chain length (e.g., DEP and DMP) with less than three carbons. They are abundant in polyvi-nyl chloride (PVC) medical devices such as blood bags, intravenous bags, nutrition pockets, tubing, catheters, respiratory masks or disposable gloves. More than 40% of all plastic-based disposable medical devices are made from PVC. Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) has been for many years the most commonly used phthalate ester plasticiser in medical devices. A recent sur - vey among the Danish Medical Device Industry found that 95% of the products contained DEHP (7). DEHP can contribute up to 40% of weight of intravenous bags and up to 80% of weight in medical tubing (8). DEHP, like other phthalates, can leach out of the plastic matrix and accumu-late in tissues. DEHP has received great attention due to its production volumes and wide usage, particularly in PVC plastic. Leaching of DEHP from PVC medical devices has been documented since the late 1960s (9, 10).BOX 2 10 Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices 11 Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices What is bisphenol A? Bisphenolo Ao(4,4-dihydroxy-2,2-diphenylpro - pane or BPA) is a chemical substance used as a monomer in the production of polymers such as polycarbonate (PC), epoxy resins, polysulfone, polyacrylate, as an antioxidant and inhibitor in the polymerisation of PVC and as a precursor for the synthesis of the flame retardant tetrabromo - bisphenol A (TBBPA). An estimated 1.5 million tonnes are used in Europe, the majority (80%) in the production of polycarbonates (11). In healthcare settings, BPA applications include devices made of polycarbonate, polysulfone and PVC that have both direct and indirect contact with patients such as medical tubing, catheters, haemodialysers, newborn incubators, syringes, surgical trays, blood oxygenators, eye lenses, nebulisers and dental sealants and coatings (12). BPA derivatives are used also in dentistry appli-cations. BPA has been shown to leach from vari-ous materials into liquids as a result of diffusion of residual BPA left during the manufacture and hydrolysis of PC polymers (13). BOX 3 Hazards for human health There is growing evidence that many phthal- ates and BPA can present a hazard to human health. Evidence comes from clinical and epide - miological studies, animal and in vitro studies encompassing both prenatal and postnatal ex - posures (see Box 4 for an overview of types of scientific evidence). Some phthalates are documented or suspect - ed endocrine disrupting substances, which can inhibit the production of testosterone in the testes (14). In human studies, in utero and post-natal exposure to phthalates has been linked with reduced ano-genital indices, repro - ductive alterations (low sperm concentration, endometriosis, hypospadias, shorter pregnan-cy duration, etc.), changes in neurobehaviour in neonates, infants and children, cholestasis, dermatitis, heart disease and perturbations in inflammatory responses (15-17). A recent study reinforced that even low level exposures to DEHP during pregnancy can affect male genital development (18). Exposure to phthalates has also been linked to obesity, diabetes and asth- ma (3, 10, 19). In animal studies exposure to phthalates has been tied to toxicity in different organs, car - cinogenicity and a series of reproductive prob - lems in both males and females. The effects of DEHP in animals has been thoroughly revised in the latest Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) draft opinion on the safety of DEHP in medi-cal devices (20). In the case of DEHP there are different sensitivities in reproductive endpoints in different age groups and in various animal species (20). Among other effects, exposure to phthalates has been tied to testicular dysgen- esis, hypofertility, polycystic ovaries, birth de altered brain development, hae - matological, metabolic and pulmonary troubles (21). BPA is an endocrine disrupting chemical able to interfere with the action of estrogenic hor - mones that are essential for the development and function of the reproductive system. It is also able to interfere with the action of other endocrine receptors, such as the thyroid hor - mones, which are important in the regulation of metabolism and the development of the nervous system (22). A recent review identi-fied more than 75 studies where exposures to BPA were associated with health effects in hu- mans, including reproductive effects (erectile dysfunction, miscarriage), thyroid, immune and metabolic diseases (diabetes) (22). Despite the different study designs, times of exposure and studies with subsets of populations and the dif - ficulty of deducing causal links in epidemiology, the increasing numbers of studies associating exposure to BPA with effects on human health raises serious concerns. Exposure in utero has been linked with spontaneous abortion, child- hood obesity, neurodevelopment impairments, respiratory conditions and behaviour alterations (anxiousness, hyperactivity, depression) (23-26). An expert appraisal by the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) concluded that \"exposure of preg-nant women to BPA posed a risk to the mammary gland of the unborn children\" (11). In animal stud- ies, foetal exposure to BPA has been linked with earlier onset of puberty and increased rates of breast and prostate cancer (27). Research needs Clinical research There is only a limited amount of research that has evaluated chemicals used in medical devic - es in healthcare settings. But such work could in theory provide relevant data to help establish the potential benefits of using one type of alterna-tive over another. Clinical research can provide the strongest evidence of the potential toxic ef - fects of a substance on human health, but there are obvious ethical limitations regarding human experimentation. Epidemiological research Epidemiological research is the most relevant for human health, but relies on finding strong cor - relations between exposure and disease, which may take many years to establish. However, it is very difficult to establish specific biological ef - fects, as effects may occur at different periods after exposure and/or the effects can be very subtle. Animal studies Fully controlled studies of the specific biological effects of particular substances using an animal model could be undertaken. In most cases such studies offer the best evidence available for a particular substance, although the results may not be extrapolated easily to humans. In vitro studies In vitro studies may allow the study in isolation of the mechanism by which a substance has an effect, but because they study the cells or bio - logical molecules outside their normal biological context it can be challenging to extrapolate their results to human health.BOX 4Exposure through medical devices Exposure to hazardous chemicals through med- ical devices can be enteral (digestive tract), through inhalation. Dietary exposure to phthal-ates and BPA is expected to account for the ma-jority of human exposure. However, non-dietary exposure has not always been well document - ed. In the case of phthalates, and particularly for DEHP, several studies have described leach-ing from medical devices and have recorded levels in urine and blood (28). According to the latest report on DEHP exposure through medi-cal devices by SCENIHR, premature neonates in neonatal intensive care units, infants subjected to repeated medical treatment using medical devices and patients undergoing haemodialysis are at risk of DEHP-induced effects (20). Recent studies show exposure to phthalates in both premature and healthy full term infants (29). DEHP exposures in neonates in intensive care are much higher than estimated safe limits and might contribute to common early and chronic complications of prematurity (30). FIG 1. Medical devices are one of a number of sources of exposure to phthalates and other endocrine disrupting chemicals.12 Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices 13 For BPA, data on leaching and exposure in pa- tients undergoing medical treatment is lacking. Nevertheless, leaching of BPA and increased levels in urine have been reported (31). Length of contact time, temperature and pH, among other parameters, have been shown to increase the release of BPA from polycarbonate (12). Several authors have also described leaching of BPA from haemodialysers (32). A number of observations from the scientific lit - erature follow, confirming the link between use of plastics in medical devices and exposure of patients to phthalates and/or BPA. Ventilated newborns with high levels of DEHP experienced respiratory degrada- tion associated with progressive radio - logical infiltrates (33). Patients undergoing regular continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis using plasticiser-free devices had reduced levels of phthalates in urine and blood (34). Serum DEHP levels in blood from healthy donors that were subjected to apheresis increased by 232% (35). A strong monotonic association was found between the use of DEHP-con- taining medical devices and urinary concentrations of three DEHP metab - olites in infants receiving care in two neonatal intensive care units (36). BPA was found to leach into the blood of patients during dialysis with a dialy - ser housing made of polycarbonate (37, 38). Infants in neonatal intensive care units using a large number of PVC-contain- ing medical devices had urinary BPA concentrations one order of magnitude higher than the median concentration and almost twice that of the 95th per - centile of the general population in the US (39). The use of infusion systems containing DEHP for total parenteral nutrition was linked with a 5-6 times increase in the risk of cholestasis in infants in neona-tal intensive care units. Moreover, the level of cholestasis in neonates was re - duced from 50% to 13% in neonates fed through a DEHP-free catheter (40). Medical procedures with potential for high exposure to DEHP (12) Exchange transfusion of blood in neonates Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment of neonates and of adults Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) in neonates Multiple procedures in sick neonates Haemodialysis in peripubertal males Haemodialysis in pregnant or lactating women Enteral nutrition in neonates and adults Heart transplantation or coronary artery bypass graft surgery Massive blood transfusion of red blood cells and plasmaBOX 5 Are neonates and children more vulnerable? The levels of exposure to hazardous chemicals are of particular concern for unborn children, neonates and children. These groups are be - ing exposed to hazardous chemicals at a high-ly vulnerable moment when various aspects of their development can be altered, perhaps with lifelong consequences. Furthermore, their low body weight means the exposure can be higher per kilogram than for adults. Premature babies are subject to an even higher risk due to their lower birth weight combined with the fact they require many medical interventions. In addition, the unborn and young are not able to metabolise chemical substances in the same way as adults, due to the on-going development of their organs and maturation of the different systems. For ex - ample, the glucuronidation mechanisms that are responsible for the excretion of some phthalate metabolites are not fully developed before the age of 3 months (3). Finally, expected longer life spans could mean that this group will be exposed for a longer time to these substances. All these factors may put this group at an increased risk of suffering deleterious effects. BOX 6 Premature infants in neonatal intensive care units undergoing treatment were found to have BPA levels 10 times high- er than the general population, pre - sumably from BPA leaching from medi-cal devices (41). Women who had been recently subject - ed to a caesarean procedure had elevat - ed levels of BPA and DEHP metabolites when compared with females who had had a natural delivery (2). The authors hypothesised that this was due to the use of urinary bags for those undergo - ing caesareans. DEHP leached from endotracheal tubes immediately after being used in high-risk newborns (42). Premature neo - nates receiving treatment through feeding tubes and endotracheal tubes had increased levels of DEHP in their urine (43). Levels of DEHP metabolites in urine were related to the number of DE-HP-containing medical devices. With- in six hours, neonates receiving lip - id-based infusates through a PVC infusion line received a DEHP dose exceeding the lower limit of the tolera- ble total daily intake (14, 44). Phthalates and BPA have been detected in aquatic and marine environments, terrestrial ecosystems and in the atmosphere in concen- trations that are likely to adversely affect a number of species (45, 46). These substanc - es have also been shown to bioaccumulate in some species of molluscs and crustaceans (47). Phthalates and BPA can reach the environment from industrial discharges, sewage, landfill leachates and natural breakdown of plastics in the environment. BPA is classified as \"moder - ately toxic\" and \"toxic\" to aquatic organisms by the European Commission and the US Environ- mental Protection Agency respectively based on data reported from aquatic invertebrates and vertebrates (46). Data collected from wild- life studies, laboratory experiments and in vitro studies show that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of BPA have shown detrimental effects in invertebrates and all ver - tebrate classes (46). Similarly, exposure to dif - ferent phthalates and/or their metabolites has caused adverse effects at various endpoints in aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant exposures (48). Besides the chemical contamination of a wide range of natural habitats, these compounds also create a waste management problem. The disposal of PVC medical waste can release diox - ins and other persistent environmental pollut - ants, which can have a detrimental impact on human health and the environment.Hazards for the environment14 Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices 15 The European legal framework on hazardous chemicals in medical devices In the EU, manufacturers of medical devices have to comply not only with the Directives on medical devices but also with the regulations on chemicals in products - the EU Regulation 1907/2006 on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and the EU Directive 2011/65/EU on the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS II). The REACH Regulation The REACH Regulation (Article 3.3) differenti-ates between medical devices that are chemical substances on their own or as mixtures (e.g., dental filling materials, bone cements, etc.) and articles where the function is not determined by the chemical composition (e.g., catheters, medical implants, diagnostic instruments, etc.). The first type of medical device is subject to most of the requirements of REACH, including registration, while articles are usually exempted (Articles 60(2) and 62(6)). Article 60(2) states: \"The Commission shall not consider the risks to human health arising from the use of a substance in a medical device regu-lated by Council Directive 90/385/EEC of 20 June 1990 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to active implantable medical devices, Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices or Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1998 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices.\" Nonetheless, suppliers, dis - tributors or retailers of medical devices have the duty to communicate information (within 45 days) about the presence of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs) if requested by a consumer (Article 33) (49). Several phthalates are classified as toxic for re - production under the EU Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 on the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (the CLP Regulation) and are listed on the Candidate List of SVHCs under REACH (see Box 7). In the case of BPA, in March 2014, the Risk Assess - ment Committee of the European Chemicals Agency adopted an opinion that BPA should be classified as toxic to reproduction based on animal experiments - Category 1B (50). If BPA becomes officially recognised in this category, it will become eligible to be classified as an SVHC. RoHS II Directive The RoHS II Directive (2011/65/EU) was adopt - ed to limit the concentration of six hazardous substances (including lead, mercury and tox - ic flame retardants) in electric and electronic products. From July 2014, the RoHS II Directive also applies to electric and electronic medical devices. In vitro medical devices will be covered from July 2016 and active implantable medical devices are exempted. Additional seven-year exemptions have been added (Annex IV) for products for which a reliable alternative is not available. Currently, RoHS II covers neither phthalates nor BPA, but a revision of the sub - stances limited under RoHS is expected in the near future. Medical Devices Directives According to the current EU medical devices Directives (90/385/EEC, 93/42/EEC, 98/79/EC and 2007/47/EC), medical devices have to be manufactured so that the risks posed by leak - ing substances are reduced to a minimum, with special attention given to substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduc - tion (CMRs). However, the regulatory frame - work does not include concrete mechanisms to phase out these substances within specific deadlines or enforce the development of safer alternatives. Instead there are only two specifications, the first on labelling (2007/47/EC): \"If parts of a device (or a device itself) intended to admin-ister and/or remove medicines, body liquids or other substances to or from the body, or devices intended for transport and storage of such body Phthalates in the Candidate List of Substances of Very High Concern (REACH) DHP: contain phthalates which are classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, of category 1 or 2, in accordance with Annex I to Directive 67/548/EEC, these devices must be labelled on the device itself and/or on the packaging for each unit or, where appropriate, on the sales packaging as a device containing phthal- ates\" (Figure 2). The Directive also specifies that if such devices are intended to treat children or pregnant or nursing women, the manufacturer should provide justification for the use of these substances, information on residual risks for these patient groups and if applicable, advise on appropriate precautionary measures. The European Commission has adopted a new proposal - COM(2012) 542 final - to recast the ex - isting Directives (Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on med-ical devices, and amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009). The proposal has been un- der intense debate. The European Parliament has voted favourably on several amendments to the Commission's text, while the Member States, through the Council of the European Union, have not yet adopted a position. FIG 2. Example of DEHP labelling DEHP DEHPPHT PHT Why publish this report now? Alternative substances and materials have be - come available in recent years for many of the most hazardous chemicals used in medical de - vices, such as phthalates and BPA. Alternatives tend to appear when legislators, procurers and patients demand them. However, the surge of new alternatives has not been accompanied by a surge of data on their safety, and regrettable substitutions must be avoided. In this report, we discuss why society is demanding a phase- out of phthalates and BPA in medical devices, provide information on how these substitutions can be promoted and achieved, and give an overview of which alternatives are available for phthalates and BPA.HCWH Europe is not alone in supporting a precautionary approach and the phase-out of hazardous chemicals in medical devices when- ever possible. A number of non-governmental organisations, consumer organisations, unions, researchers, healthcare professionals and, more recently, the members of the European Parliament have noted that the substitution of hazardous chemicals by safer alternatives is needed. As Kambia and co-authors stated more than ten years ago in the International Journal of Pharmaceutics, when exposure to hazardous chemicals in medical devices can be avoided through careful selection of materials, not car - rying out such substitution is both unprofes - sional and undesirable (51). 17 16Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices Exposure to phthalates or BPA can be mini- mised by adopting a precautionary approach and replacing medical devices with phthal- ate-free and BPA-free devices which can pro - vide the same efficiency. The precautionary principle is enshrined in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (EU) and aims to ensure a high level of environmen-tal, consumer and human health protection through preventive decision-making in the case of risk. Nevertheless, the principle is rarely ap - plied in practice and decision makers prefer to wait until overwhelming scientific evidence is gathered - often taking a long time to achieve, and potentially delaying action to a point where risks and effects cannot be undone. On the European market, several manufactur - ers offer products where phthalates/PVC or BPA have been replaced by alternative materi-als or substances. In the case of the phthalates, phthalate-free or PVC-free medical devices are available for nearly all product categories ex - cept blood bags. This is nonetheless expected to change in the near future thanks to an EU pilot project (see Box 8). Chapter 1 Substituting hazardous chemicals in medical devices Many hospitals have already made consider - able progress, having adopted phase-out poli- cies and committing to using products that are less harmful for patients (see Chapter 4). How - ever, most of these initiatives are happening in such hospitals only due to the commitment of individuals because of the lack of the necessary political or regulatory support. In a project for the European Commission's Directorate General Environment, the Swedish Environmental Management Council developed a set of EU Green Public Procurement (GPP) cri- teria with regards to electrical and electronic medical devices. In July 2014, the Commission published these voluntary GPP criteria. The draft criterion on BPA entailed the phase-out of BPA in certain parts of specific medical de - vices that come into contact with the body of patients. Regrettably, the initially agreed and envisaged criterion on BPA was excluded and does not appear in the final published version. The PVC-free Blood Bag Project The PVC-free Blood Bag Project is a Life+ collab - orative project between industry and the health- care sector that aims to demonstrate that it is possible to produce a blood bag without using PVC and to increase market demand. Four Eu-ropean companies are working together to pro - duce this blood bag. The project, which should be completed in 2016, is now in a testing phase. PVC-free blood bag prototypes are being tested in the Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden. Readers working in the healthcare sector who would like to support the project are able to sign an online petition available at the project's web - site (www.pvcfreebloodbag.eu). This will help show demand for PVC-free blood bags.BOX 8 19 18Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices Governmental initiatives Three European countries, Denmark, France and Germany, have taken legislative steps to re - duce the use of phthalates and/or BPA. All three countries have addressed - to varying degrees - the issue of DEHP-containing medical de - vices. These actions provide welcome political support to efforts to improve healthcare in this regard. The Nordic Council of Ministers, the of - ficial inter-governmental body for cooperation in the Nordic Region also promotes the Swan Ecolabel, which among other product catego - ries also includes certain healthcare products. The Danish example Denmark introduced a national ban on DEHP, DBP, DIBP and BBP under its national phthalate strate - gy, initially set for December 2013, later postponed to 2015, and challenged in July 2014 by the European Commission (52). The ban was only appli-cable to consumer products and did not cover medical de - vices. Nonetheless, the Dan-ish Health Minister had also supported the phasing out of phthalates in medical devic - es, pushing for the creation of partnerships between indus - try, national authorities and experts to call for a European phase-out within a reasonable time frame (53). Within the phthalate strategy, in 2013 the Dan- ish Health and Medicines Authority (DHMA) published a set of guidelines to help Danish regions and municipalities reduce the use of particular types of phthalates in medical devic - es by means of their general purchasing poli- cy (54). The main goal is to: \"take initiatives to ensure a continued reduction of the use of classi- fied phthalates in medical devices whenever pos - sible without compromising patient safety and to constantly work to minimise the use of classified phthalates in general\". The DHMA suggests including a \"free of classi-fied phthalates\" requirement as a competition requirement in the tender process that would be preferably, but not necessarily, fulfilled. Thus suppliers would gain an advantage if they ful- filled this requirement, providing an incentive and contributing to phasing out phthalates in medical devices. The guidelines provide exam- ples of requirements and suggest that require - ments should also be established for invasive medical devices not covered by the labelling rules. The guidelines focus on a progressive phase-out of the use of phthalates in medical devices. The Danish Ministry of Environment also collat - ed a list of medical devices that do not contain any of the phthalates that are subject to com-pulsory labelling. The goal of the list was to in- spire procurement officers and others involved in purchasing medical devices (55). The French example In December 2012, the French Senate approved a law that bans, for the first time, the use of tubes containing DEHP in paediatric, neonatol- ogy and maternity wards (Law No. 2012-1442 - Article L. 5214-1). The ban, which will enter into force in July 2015, foresees the possibility to also prohibit the use of DEHP and other phthalates like DBP and BBP in all medical devices if alter - native materials are available and the safety of the device is guaranteed. The same legislative act also introduces a ban on food packaging containing BPA intended to come into direct contact with food. The German example In May 2006, the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices issued a recom- mendation (Reference Nr.: 9211/0506) to push hospitals to minimise or avoid the use of DE-HP-containing medical devices in specific pop - ulation groups, including premature babies and newborns, infants and toddlers, children and adolescents, pregnant women and nurs - ing mothers (56). The recommendation also in-cludes a call for manufacturers to step up their production of alternative products. However, as this recommendation is only voluntary it is THE MAIN GOAL IS TO: \"take initiatives to ensure a continued reduction of the use of classified phthalates in medical devices whenever possible without compromising patient safety and to constantly work to minimise the use of classified phthalates in general\" . difficult to assess how it has been applied across the different German hospitals. The Nordic or Swan Ecolabel The Nordic or Swan Ecolabel (www.nordic-eco - label.org) is a known and trusted ecolabel. In- troduced by the Nordic Council of Ministers, the label is an official, but voluntary, ecolabel for the Nordic countries. The label covers more than sixty product categories and now includes disposable healthcare products that do not con- tain PVC or harmful plasticisers. In the case of healthcare products it covers disposable prod-ucts intended and marketed for intravenous (IV) infusion treatment, peritoneal dialysis treatment, treatment of urinary retention and incontinence and also ostomy pouches and ac - cessories for treatment following ileostomy, co - lostomy or ureterostomy surgery. In the future, the label might be extended to more product categories, depending on request from manu- facturers. Manufacturers interested in carrying the eco - label on their products agree to follow a num- ber of requirements that include environmen- tal, quality and health criteria (see Box 9) (57). Compliance with the requirements for a specific product is assessed via independent laborato - ries, certification procedures and on-site in- spections. Summary of environmental and health requirements for the Swan label on disposable healthcare products Halogenated plastics, such as PVC, are not allowed in the product. No plasticisers or other additives added to the plastic nor adhesives used in or on the various parts of the product may: Be classified as, or meet different cri-teria, of hazard classes or categories of the EU Dangerous Substances Directive and Dangerous Preparations Directive 67/548/EC and 99/45/EC as amend-ed and the CLP Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008.BOX 9 Have properties categorised in REACH as substances of very high concern and similar substances including: CMR sub - stances (carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic) categories 1, 2 and 3; PBT substances (persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic) and/or vPvB substances (very persistent and very bioaccumulative); substances considered to be or have po - tential to be endocrine disruptors (EDCs) in accordance with EU reports and lists concerning EDCs; other substances re - corded on the EU's Candidate List of DBP, DINP, DIDP. The relevant national regulations, laws and/or industry-wide agreements on recycling systems for the packaging must comply with those of the Nordic countries in which the product will be marketed.20Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices Non-governmental initiatives The Safer Medical Devices Database by HCWH Europe One of the issues that hospitals face when start - ing a phase-out programme for phthalates or BPA is knowing what alternatives are available and the impact of the new substance. Engage - ment and communication with manufacturers is therefore essential. However, this can be a very time-consuming activity for an individual hospital. To facilitate this task, HCWH has main-tained lists with examples of phthalate-free or PVC-free medical devices available on the Euro - pean and North American markets. In July 2014, HCWH Europe took a step forward and launched an online listing of phthalate-free or PVC-free medical products available in the European market - the Safer Medical Devices Database (safermedicaldevices.org, see Box 10). The goals of the new open-access web- service are to enable healthcare procurers to identify medical devices that do not contain PVC and/or phthalates and that are already available on the European market, and to provide mar - ket evidence that the phase-out of phthalates and/or PVC in medical devices is feasible. For each product category, registered manufactur - ers can add their products directly into the da- tabase (which is maintained and administered by HCWH Europe). Registered healthcare pro - fessionals that procure or use these medical devices can leave comments on the feasibility of specific products. In the near future BPA-free products will also be listed on the database. The Swedish Substitution List by the Substitution Group on chemicals HCWH has not been alone in producing tools to help healthcare procurers. The Swedish regions and counties and the Swedish Environmen- tal Management Council, through the nation-al Substitution Group on chemicals, maintain and regularly update a Substitution List for hazardous substances in the healthcare sec - tor, available online (www.kkv.se/upphandling/ hallbar-upphandling/stall-hallbarhetskrav/ke - mikalier/nationella-substitutionsgruppen/). The Substitution Group is a voluntary initiative of engaged personnel at Swedish hospitals and universities who exchange information on saf - er alternatives for both products and chemicals. The Substitution List compiles information on products available in the Swedish market to help healthcare procurers make healthier and more informed choices (58). Products are or - ganised by product category (use), and possible alternatives of the hazardous substances are listed for each product, including at least one supplier. The Substitution Portal by Kooperationsstelle Hamburg IFE GmbH and partners The Substitution Support Portal - SUBSPORT (www.subsport.eu) - is a multi-lingual collab - orative project coordinated by Kooperations - stelle Hamburg IFE GmbH (a consultancy based in Germany), the International Chemical Sec - retariat - ChemSec (a non-profit organisation based in Sweden), Grontmij (a consultancy How to use the HCWH Europe Safer Medical Devices database Users of the website (safermedicaldevices.org) can search the database by inputting a search term of interest. The search returns information on medical devices that contain the introduced word or combination of words - their Global Medical Device Nomenclature (GMDN) name, product category, manufacturer and country where the product is available. An optional tick box allows users to select only PVC-free products. The results of the search are downloadable in an excel file. Manufacturers of medical devices can register free of charge on the database to add their prod-ucts provided they follow the standard question-naire and submit requested information. Procurers and users of medical devices working in healthcare institutions can also register free of charge to provide comments about the per - formance and feasibility of particular products should they have specific knowledge of their use. BOX 10 21based in Denmark) and the Instituto Sindical de Trabajo, Ambiente y Salud - ISTAS (a technical body of one of the Spanish workers unions). The project aims to provide useful information on substitution and provide resources to those interested in substituting hazardous chemicals in products. The portal contains legal informa- tion on substitution throughout Europe, a da-tabase of restricted and priority substances, a compilation of criteria for the identification of hazardous substances, organisation of training programmes and provision of materials, discus - sion forums and a database comprising case stories. The Case Story database in the portal can be searched by substance and/or by sector, in-cluding \"human health, social work and veteri- nary activities\". Under this sector, 61 results are available (in English) including the assessment of alternative substances for ten substances or groups of substances of high concern - includ- ing BPA - plus several case studies from hospi-tals (60).The GreenScreen\u00ae Chemicals Alternative Assessment and the Plastics Scorecard by Clean Production Action The GreenScreen\u00ae for Safer Chemicals (www. greenscreenchemicals.org), developed by the non-profit organisation Clean Production Ac - tion, employs an open, transparent methodol- ogy to perform chemical hazard assessment. It is used by a wide range of professionals, gov - ernmental and non-governmental bodies and manufacturers to assess the hazard of chemi-cals and their potential effect on human health and the environment. The goal is to push for the substitution of hazardous chemicals by saf - er alternatives. Clean Production Action has used the Green- Screen\u00ae to assess and determine the hazard level of chemicals for its Plastics Scorecard re - port (61). The report details a method for evalu- ating the chemical footprint of plastics that can help guide business, hospitals and individuals to select safer alternatives. One of the case studies of the report is the comparison between two types of plastic IV bags - Polyolefin IV bags and PVC/DEHP IV bags. 22Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices DEHP has long been the principle phthalate used to soften PVC for the purpose of manu- facturing medical devices. There are reports that the use of DEHP has diminished. Howev - er, these reports seem to be anecdotal. In a re - cent survey of the Denmark medical industry, 95% of the manufacturers still used DEHP (7). However, 60% of the companies have products which do not contain phthalates and 80% of those using phthalates believe that substitution should not be problematic over a period of 3-5 years (7). Alternative substances for replacing phthalates exist for a number of products, in- cluding the majority of applications in medical devices (8). The alternatives are sometimes other plasticisers and sometimes the substi-tution of PVC with other materials that do not need a plasticiser (61, 62). No clinical studies have systematically com- pared the health outcomes of different sub - stances used in medical devices, particularly comparing DEHP and other phthalates with alternatives. Nonetheless, a few studies from manufacturers, regulatory agencies, research-ers and NGOs have looked into alternatives for phthalates or PVC in medical devices (20, 60, 63-67). For example, the Dow Corning Corpo - ration compared three common materials used in catheters: silicones, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and latex rubber. The goal of the study was to provide a strong case for the use of catheters with silicone traded by Dow Corning Corpora-tion, by focusing on the reduced risk of allergic responses to silicone as judged by the incidence of phlebitis, frequency of sepsis, encrustations, infections and deflation (63). In 2014, the Danish Environmental Protection Agency published a report looking at alterna-tive plasticisers in medical devices to DEHP, Chapter 2 Alternatives to phthalates BBP, DBP and DIBP. The overall purpose of the report was to come up with a list of alterna- tives to help guide manufacturers of medical devices to substitute these plasticisers (65). The report screened available information ex - isting in the REACH registration dossiers for a list of substances and found that the values of the \"no effect level\" (DNEL) for the general population were all higher in comparison with DEHP, meaning these substances would in prin- ciple be safer than DEHP (65). In the Plastics Scorecard report, the plastic footprint of poly - olefin and PVC in IV bags was compared (60). The results of the comparison showed that the substitution of PVC bags by polyolefin-based polymers greatly reduced the chemical foot - print of the products. Two research studies also reviewed the exist - ing alternatives to DEHP and PVC in medical devices and identified several research gaps (66, 67). These studies supplement a variety of other studies that have assessed the safety and performance of specific substances in specific categories of medical equipment (28). In the following tables we summarise the ap - plications, advantages, disadvantages, toxicity and main knowledge gaps of known alternative plasticisers to phthalates (Table 1) or known al- ternative polymers to PVC (Table 2) based on information available in existing reviews, as - sessments and studies. 25 24Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices Alternative Plasticis - er (CAS)Advantages Disadvantages ToxicityDataLowest NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) (critical (65)Application Further Research needed Acetyl-n-butyl DEHP (20)Leaching in feeding solutions volatility (65)Can bioaccu-mulate toxicity in body weightInhibits the prolif - eration of lymph node T cells (68)300 mg/kg bw/day (liver weight)Blood bags and medical tubing (extra-corpo - real tubing)Effects from pro - longed exposure unknown (65, 67)Data on reproductive toxicity lacking (65) n-Butyr - yl-tri-n-hexyl-ci-trate - BTHC (82469-79-2)Leachability into (69)Incidents of activity)Blood and storage bagsData on reproductive and developmental toxicity and on endocrine activity are needed (65) Acetyl-tri-n-hexyl citrate - ATHC toxicity (66)No genotoxicity (66)No data Data on human lacking (66) trimel-litate - TOTM/TEHTM/TETM (3319-31-1)Lower bw/day (reproduction)Haemodial-ysis tubing, blood bags, infusion setsResearch needed on the toxicity, metabolism and long-term effects in humans (67)Limited data on environmental effects (68) Di-iso-nonyl-cy - environmental persistence (66)Low migration rate (65)Controversy on toxicity results presented by the manufacturer and independent research (20, 68)Low acute toxicity (73)No reproductive toxicity (20)Repeated exposure caused increased liver, kidney, respiratory tubes, packaging for nutrient solutions, catheters, gloves and breathing masksNo data on effects of environmental exposures (64)Independent studies and reproductive toxicology (67) Polyadipates (several CAS)Leaching a problem (65)Higher volatility (65)Mild sensitisation (68) No data Gastric tubes Developmental and reproductive toxicity data non existent (67)No data on bioac - cumulation (68) Sulfonic acids, mg/kg bw/day (foetoxicity)Medical devices circuitsNo comprehensive study on toxic effects or environmental exposures (64) Glycerides, cas - tor-oil-mono-hy - drogenated, ace - (736150-63-3)Low migration potential (65)Low volatility (65)No carcinogenicityNo risks to workers(75)> 1000 mg/kg bw/dayTubing, connec - tors, dialysis catheters, fluid bagsData on reproductive toxicity missing (65)No data on environ-mental exposures (68) Epoxidized soy - bean oil - ESBO (8013-07-8)Low volatility (65)Biodegradable in aerobic envi-ronments (68)Asthma in work - ers (68)Bioaccumulative (68)Skin and eye irritation (76)Repeated exposure suspected to have effects on kidney, liver, testis and uterus (76)100 mg/kg bw/day (liver weight) TABLE 1.

Applications, advantages, disadvantages, toxicity and main knowledge gaps of known alternative materials to PVC in medical devices (Adapted from reference (64) A concern that has been raised by a study from Genay and coworkers is that not all DEHP-free devices are in practice DEHP-free, as DEHP con- tinues to be used in smaller quantities below the thresholds of contamination defined by REACH (0.1% by weight) (84). According to this study only two out of nine tested medical devic - es (infusion and extension sets) manufactured with alternative plasticisers were truly DEHP free. These results point to the necessity for manufacturers to verify the purity of raw ma-terials for all plastics used in the composition of the various parts of a medical device and not just PVC (84). 26Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices The hazardous properties of BPA and those of some of its alternatives have been reviewed re - cently in several studies (12, 59, 85, 86). None of these reviews looked specifically at BPA al-ternatives in the medical device industry. The SCENIHR report on BPA in medical devices made only a brief overall note of existing stud- ies on both bisphenol S and bisphenol F toxicity (12). The most thorough review was the ANSES report, which identified 73 alternatives to BPA, including 21 for polycarbonate plastic, 18 for ep - oxy resins and 34 for thermic paper (85). One common conclusion from all the reviews is that because BPA is used ubiquitously, there is no single replacement for all industrial solutions. As for phthalates, the substitution of BPA can be done by replacing BPA with chemical alter - natives or by substituting the plastic polymer with another plastic polymer or material. Other bisphenols have been indicated as po - tential substitutes for BPA. This is the case for bisphenol S, bisphenol F and bisphenol AP (al-though there is no indication at the European level that bisphenol AP is being used in med- ical devices) (see Table 3). However, existing data shows that due to their similar structure they can have similar or even worse health ef - fects than BPA (11, 87). Other bisphenols like bisphenol M and BADGE are used in medical devices but cannot be used as alternatives to BPA (11). Known alternatives to BPA or to the plastic polymer containing BPA that are used in medical devices include many of the alterna-tives for phthalates such as polyethylene, poly - propylene, polyurethane, silicone and acetylo - nitrile-butadiene-styrene (see Table 2). Other common replacements that will not be detailed in this report include ceramic, stainless steel, glass and acrylic. The information available for the alternatives to BPA in medical devices is considerably less than that existing for phthal-Chapter 3 Alternatives to bisphenol A ate alternatives. More specific BPA alternatives have only appeared more recently and informa- tion about them is much more sparse and the data gaps much bigger. Manufacturers already replacing BPA in their medical devices include, for example, Didac - tic (www.didactic.fr) (88), Technoflex (www. technoflex.net) (89), Mamivac Fresenius Medical Care (www.fmc-ag. com) and Nipro Europe (www.nipro-europe. com). Two recent studies, one of them including med- ical devices containing alternative substanc - es to polycarbonate plastic, have found that many of the alternative products also leached chemicals with estrogenic activity (90, 91). However, one of the studies identified prod-ucts made with glycol modified polyethylene terephthalate (PETG), COC) as poten- tial alternatives that did not release chemicals with detectable estrogenic activity under the conditions tested (91). The applications, advan- tages, disadvantages, toxicity data and main knowledge gaps for known replacements of BPA are presented in Table 4. A substance that has been indicated as a potential substitute for BPA in some reviews is a polyamide registered as Grilamid TR-90TM (CAS 163800-66-6). How - ever, as little information was found about this polyamide and concrete use in medical devices we have not detailed its characteristics in the Table. 28Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices Alternative Bisphenols (CAS)Advantages Disadvantages ToxicityDataLowest NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) (critical endpoint) (65)Use Further Research needed Bisphenol S - (92)Leaches from and materialVery limited number of in vivo studies, no data on chronic and human toxicity (11) Bisphenol F - BPF (620-92-8)Estrogenicity (87)Anti-androgenic materialVery few in vivo and human studies (11)TABLE 3. Applications, advantages, disadvantages, toxicity and main knowledge gaps of possible bisphenol alternatives to BPA in medical devices. Concerns about BPA in dental materials BPA has been detected in the saliva of patients after dentistry treatments (103). In dental ma-terials, BPA is used during the synthesis of the monomers of dental composites, sealants, ce - ments and orthodontic appliances. The handling and polymerisation of these substances is partly done inside the oral cavity of patients. The majority of dental composites are based on bisphenol A glycidyl methacrylate (bis-GMA), BPA is never present in its pure state, but can appear either as an impurity from the synthesis process or can leach into the saliva as result of the hydrolysis of bis-DMA (104-106). A recent study found increased concentrations of BPA in both saliva and urine after compos - ite placement (107). Different studies have also demonstrated that BPA is released from dentist - ry material into the oral cavity in a time-depen-dent manner (108). Most studies have found that levels of BPA in both saliva and urine return to pre-restoration levels in the space of hours or days, but additional studies are needed to ad-dress the effects of those peaks in human health and in patients with multiple large restorations. The SCHENIHR report on BPA in medical devices has reviewed thoroughly existing exposure and BOX 11toxicity studies of BPA in dental materials (12). Healthcare practitioners should be particularly cautious about placing composites containing BPA in pregnant women. Manufacturers should correctly label their products and develop mate - rials with less estrogenic properties (105, 109). Practitioners of dental restoration work should prefer alternative materials that do not contain mercury, do not release BPA and that do not put at risk the health of patients. 29Alternative Material (CAS)Advantages Disadvantages ToxicityDataUse Further Research needed classified as possible human carcinogen (83)Lack of estrogen-ic activity (91)Medical syringes, catheters, medical diagnostic componentsNo information on toxicity or ecotoxicity Poly-lactic acid - PLA (26199-51-6)Biocompatibility (96)Produced from a renewable resource (86)No chemicals of concern (86)High cost (97)Slow degradation rate (97)Might plasticisers (86)Production can problematic (86)Durability (86)Heat sensitive (98)No known health effects (86)Medical implants, bone fixation devicesNo data on chronic and human toxicity Polyetherimide (61128-46-9)Good technical, mechanical and elec - trical properties (85)Heat resistance (85)No known human health effects (4)Low acute toxicityResins for healthcare applications, sterili-sation trays, dentist devices, pipettesNo data on chronic and human toxicity Polyethersul-fone - PESU (25667-42-9)Durability (85)Sterilization re - sistance (91)Very persistent in the environmentContains BPS (85)PESU does not show estrogenic activity but its metabolites do (99)Medical tubing, dialysers, orthopaedic, dental and surgical instrumentsNo data on chronic and human toxicity Polyphenylsul- fone - PPSU (25608-64-4)Resistance to UV and temperature (85)Not biodegradable (100)Might contain carbon black (potential carcino - genic substance) (100)Not harmful to hu-man health (100)Medical tubing, or - thopaedic, dental and surgical instrumentsGeneral lack of toxicity data Terephthalate polymers - PET / PETG (several CAS)Safe for use in med-ical devices (101)Stability (4)Cost (59)Lack of performance at high temperatures (4)Some products leach endocrine dis - rupting chemicals (4)No genotoxicity (4)No toxicity (4)No suspected risks to human health (59)No suspected risks to the environment (59)Lack of estrogen-ic activity (91)Heart valves, endovascular devices, sutures and vascular graftsNo data on data regarding estrogenic - ity (86, 90, 102)No skin irritation or sensitisation (86)IInfusion devices, syringes, medical devices housing, renal and blood apparatus componentsIndependent stud-ies neededTABLE 4. Applications, advantages, disadvantages, toxicity and main knowledge gaps of potential BPA replacements in medical devices.31 30Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices Healthcare facilities and professionals play an important role in the substitution of hazardous chemicals. They have both an ethical responsi- bility to use products that are less hazardous for patients and an enormous purchasing pow - er that can push manufacturers in the right di- rection. In Europe, public procurement of goods accounts for 16% of the European market. In fact, public authorities purchase large amounts of products and services for the healthcare sector alone. Healthcare facilities are major consumers of standard products and materi-als \u2014 everything from electronic equipment to paper, hospital gowns, packaging materials, pa- per towels, surgical instruments, to name but a few \u2014 and eighty per cent of these products are thrown away after a single use. Hospitals throughout Europe are working to minimise the exposure of their patients to hazardous chemicals. The first step of many hospitals has been to identify which products contain substances of concern and develop an internal substitution strategy/policy. Many have launched substitution projects, particularly tar - geting DEHP and PVC in medical devices. These strategies and policies help hospitals in their purchasing decisions. In 2008, HCWH published a report with infor - mation, examples, and guidance for healthcare facilities to improve their purchasing decisions regarding chemicals - Guide to Choosing Safer Products and Chemicals: Implementing Chem-icals Policy in Health Care (available online at noharm-uscanada.org/sites/default/files/doc - uments-files/57/Guide_to_Safer_Chems.pdf). For the present report, HCWH Europe has col-lated information on best practices in Europe - an hospitals and approaches towards non-toxic healthcare.Chapter 4 Best practices in European healthcare Hospital of Southern Jutland substitution project (Denmark) 32The Hospital of Southern Jutland started a sub - stitution project in 2005 to replace medical devices containing PVC. The project focused on medical devices coming into contact with patients, primarily neonates and children. At the beginning of the project the alterna- tives were 2.5 to 3 times more expensive, but nowadays there is no difference in price at this hospital. The alternative products sup - plied by different manufacturers had the same quality and applicability as the prod- ucts containing hazardous substances (110). Stockholm County Council has a strategy in place to phase out or reduce the use of certain groups of chemicals in all their realms of activi-ty, including healthcare (111). The Swedish local and national governments were behind the im- plementation of the phase-out strategy, expect - ed to be concluded by 2016. The strategy covers several chemical classes including phthalates, PVC, BPA, brominated flame-retardants, mer - cury and glutaraldehyde. Products that contain substances to be phased out cannot be pur - chased and products that contain substances to be reduced can only be purchased in exception- al cases. The phthalates BBP, DBP and DEHP are are on the reduction list. The County Council also started a project in 2004 to progressively phase out PVC exam-ination gloves in its hospitals. These gloves are among the most extensively used products in healthcare settings and can contain as much as 50% of PVC. The adopted procurement guide - lines required that gloves be free of phthalates, PVC, latex and powder and have only low levels of rubber additives. The guidelines address not only the hazard of phthalates but also the prob - lem that both latex and powders in gloves can trigger allergenic reactions. Nitrile, neoprene and polyurethane have been recommended as substitutes for PVC and latex in examination gloves. The procurement guide - lines adopted by the Stockholm County Council not only allowed the replacement of PVC gloves but also resulted in a progressive lowering of the price of the nitrile gloves. Over a 5-year period, the price of nitrile gloves decreased by one half. Stockholm County Council's phase-out list (Sweden) 33Anaesthesia products 60-80% Blood collection products 80-100% Blood monitoring systems Drainage devices sets 40-60% Urology and incontinence products 80-100%TABLE 5. Karolinska University Hospital - substitution levels of PVC and phthalates in medical devicesKarolinska University Hospital substitution programme (Sweden) Karolinska University Hospital is conducting an active substitution programme in agreement with the Stockholm County Council chemicals strategy. Since 2006 the procurement of sub - stances in the list has declined by 88%, with some substances having been completely phased out. All the divisions and departments of the hospital follow the substitution programme. Table 5 shows an overview of some of the prod-ucts and the correspondent substitution levels for PVC and phthalates at the hospital. Doctors and nurses in the Westfriesgasthuis Hospital pushed for a procurement policy to phase out PVC medical devices in the Neona- tology and Paediatrics Department. The policy covers all product categories used in the de - partment and allows for substitution of a ma- jority of the products (80-100%). The hospital has not carried out a thorough assessment of PVC-free Paediatrics and Neonatology Department in the Westfriesgasthuis (The Netherlands) PVC-free Neonatal Intensive Care Units of the Vienna Hospitals Association (Austria)the costs, but estimated a slight increase in the costs in the short-term. Contrary to common belief, they found that some of the alternatives were cheaper than the PVC-containing ones. To avoid unnecessary health burdens for pre - mature babies, the Vienna Hospitals Associa-tion adopted a PVC-free policy in their Neonatal Intensive Care Units. The criteria cover invasive consumables and products that come into con- tact with the skin of babies. In the Neonatol-ogy Unit of the Glanzing Children's Hospital, the phase-out of PVC started in 2001 and the PVC content of invasive medical products was halved by 2010, with an estimated increase in prices of less than 15% (112). Medical Device Substitution LevelNon-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices34Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices A number of governments, regulatory author - ities, healthcare systems, hospitals, healthcare professionals and medical devices manufactur - ers have endorsed a move towards medical de - vices that are free from hazardous chemicals, so that patients do not have to be exposed to unnecessary risks when safer alternatives are available. This is even more important when patients' expo - sure can be minimised without compromising medical care. It should be simple enough to prefer a device that does not in- crease health risks for patients. In June 2013, HCWH Europe launched a declaration asking for the phase-out of hazardous chemicals in medical devices. The declaration was supported by international and European organisations representing more than 500 hospitals, medical institutions and healthcare systems and 16 million healthcare professionals (noharm-europe.org/documents/ declaration-safer-medical-devices). This HCWH Europe report shows that the med- ical device industry is already phasing out haz - ardous chemicals like phthalates and BPA from their products. The availability of alternatives confirms that this change can be done and the existing research, even if limited, shows that the choice of a device can make a difference in exposure terms. Although concerns have been raised in the past regarding the higher cost of safer alternatives, this is not the experience of the healthcare providers that have undertaken substitution. Indeed, the health costs associat - ed with the use of medical devices containing hazardous chemicals are either not account - ed for or highly undervalued. For example, the United Nations Environment Programme, Chapter 5 Recommendations and Conclusions of Health Care Without Harm Europe using existing numbers for 2004, reported that globally almost 10% of the deaths are related to environmental exposures (113). Furthermore, the case studies presented in this report show that there is not always a difference in price, and, if there is, it is likely to be negligible in the long term. Health Care Without Harm Europe will continue to raise awareness on the poten-tial exposure of patients to hazardous chemi-cals via medical devices and to disseminate and promote safer alternatives. \"Health Care Without Harm Europe will continue to raise awareness on the potential exposure of patients to hazardous chemicals via medical devices and to disseminate and promote safer alternatives.\" 35Labelling requirements for hazardous chemicals in medical devices should be expanded Introduce obligatory labelling of haz - ardous substances in medical devices. Develop harmonised environmental cri- teria for hazardous chemicals in medi-cal devices. The labelling of DEHP introduced in Directive 2007/47/EC has been a driver for substitution by raising awareness in the healthcare commu-nity about the chemical composition of every - day products. Labelling increases information for healthcare staff. Therefore, labelling require - ments should be expanded to other substanc - es, besides DEHP, such as other phthalates and BPA. Improved disclosure of product ingredi-ents would allow healthcare professionals to better understand where these substances are present and to prioritise their replacement. The EU Ecolabel and the Nordic Swan label, among others, can help establish harmonised environ-mental criteria for medical devices and differ - ent groups of hazardous chemicals to avoid any gaps or inconsistencies. Moreover, the adoption of obligatory labelling for hazardous chemicals in medical devices will increase general aware - ness on the issue pushing patients and health- care professionals and facilities to demand saf - er products. European legislation must protect European citizens and, in particular, the most vulnerable groups, by creating the conditions to rapidly reduce or eliminate human exposure to hazardous chemicals such as phthalates and bisphenol A contained in medical devices. Apply the precautionary principle in EU legislation by creating a regulatory framework that requires the phase-out of hazardous chemicals, such as phthal-ates and BPA contained in medical devices, and protects the safety of pa- tients and healthcare workers. Legislation has a crucial double role in both protecting patients and consumers from expo - sure to hazardous chemicals and in sparking innovation. The adoption of strict progressive pieces of legislation can be a huge driver of innovation and push for the invention and de - velopment of safer alternatives (112). The inclu- sion of certain phthalates in the Authorisation List under REACH, for example, has led to an increase in the number of patented alternatives (114). Therefore, an expected phase-out of haz - ardous chemicals in medical devices, under the new Medical Devices Regulation, would also ul- timately lead to an increase in innovation in the health technology sector. Standards for pre-market evaluation of medical devices should include more data on chemicals used in medical devices and allow a performance comparison of individual substances Avoid regrettable substitutions. Improve data requirements for medical devices approval. Subject medical devices (articles) to the requirements of the REACH Regulation. Innovation cannot be the only driver for regu-lation. The safety evaluation of medical devices also needs to be improved. The substitution of a hazardous chemical with a structurally simi- lar substance to minimise impact on the man- ufacturing of the product or with a substance for which toxicity data is not available must be avoided (114). A key element for generating data on chemi- cals used in medical devices is reforming the existing data requirements, which hamper the development of adequate data and safer alter - natives. Currently a medical device has to pass a minimum benchmark as defined by a series of standards (ISO 10993) in order to be ap - proved for use. The benchmark itself produces little toxicological data. No comprehensive tox - icological testing, of the sort that would allow relative performance of individual compounds, or post-marketing evaluation, which would HCWH Europe's Recommendations 36Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices 37follow clinical outcomes caused by varying com- position of devices, is apparently in place. Even worse, if a compound has a history of use, then its on-going use is assured. For example, con-tinued use of DEHP is justified on the grounds that it has been used for many years and that it helps in treating patients, regardless of its neg - ative health impacts. Better evidence and tech- nical performance of alternatives is needed to guarantee that safer alternatives are used. Increase transparency of the market authorisation process for medical devices Improve the access to the authorisation data on medical devices. The market authorisation for medical devices needs to be improved to ensure that approved medical devices are both efficient and safe for patients. The European Commission's database on devices approved in the European market (Eudamed) should be publicly available, so that procurers, researchers and other stakeholders have easy access to data on the devices. Clin- ical data used to approve devices should also be made publicly available so that healthcare professionals can better evaluate the risks and benefits of the medical products and make in-formed decisions. Sustainable procurement guidelines should provide incentives for the substitution of hazardous chemicals in medical devices Adopt EC Green Public Procurement (GPP) criteria for chemicals contained in medical devices. Adopt regional and national strategies and tools to phase out hazardous chem-icals in medical devices, such as the substitution group of chemicals created by the Swedish Environmental Manage - ment Council and the Swedish County Councils (see p. 16). Procurement practices can contribute to a quicker phase-out of certain hazardous chem- icals in medical devices by driving manufac - turers to develop alternatives to those chemi- cals/products and by assessing if the available alternatives are feasible. The healthcare sector is a growing industry with a high demand for equipment that can, through responsible pur - chasing policies, drive the market. Hospitals are increasingly demanding products that are free of certain groups of chemicals, thereby driving research, innovation and lowering the market price of the products. The introduction of green procurement criteria at the regional, national and European levels can lead to the phase-out of hazardous chemicals in medical devices. An attempt was made in 2014 while setting EU GPP criteria for electric and electronic medical de - vices (see p. 13). Funding for research and development of alternative substances and products and for clinical and epidemiological projects that compare the performance of these alternatives should be prioritised Make available research funds for clin- ical and epidemiological studies on chemical exposure, particularly for comparing exposure and outcomes in patients being treated with similar de - vices but containing different chemi- cals. Prioritise research and innovation fund- ing for the development of safer prod-ucts that reduce chemical exposure of all types in the health technology sector. Provide more incentives for healthcare facilities to consider substitution. Governmental authorities should support the development of safer alternatives to medi-cal devices containing hazardous chemicals and prioritise funding for the development of those substitutes. The diversion of funding for these alternatives can be complementary to the adoption of stricter regulations.European manufacturers of medical devic - es, under some regulatory pressure, have increased the development of alternatives to both phthalates and BPA in medical devices. In the case of phthalates, the Danish medical device industry has taken a lead and supported the view of many healthcare professionals and NGOs that a phase-out of phthalates is possible and should be promoted (7). As new alternatives appear on the market, it is of utter importance to weigh their bene - fits. Unfortunately, for many of the new alter - native substances and materials chronic and sub-chronic toxicity studies are still missing. However, different studies have pointed out that many of these alternatives show better toxicological profiles than certain phthalates and/or BPA (65-67). Our analysis of the existing alternatives reveals knowledge gaps for many of the alternatives, particularly the ones for BPA that in some cases have appeared more re - cently on the market. Conclusions However, inert polymers that leach fewer chem-icals are less likely to cause harm than contin- ued use of those that leach large quantities of phthalates or BPA. The benefits of substitution might take many years to be apparent, and the extent of the benefit may never be totally clear, but that does not mean it is not favourable to carry out substitution, reducing exposure to a potentially harmful substance. In the absence of sufficient data for a full risk-benefit analy - sis of a medical device, substitution is the best course of action. 38 Non-toxic Healthcare: Alternatives to Phthalates and Bisphenol A in Medical Devices 39 1.
