What is High Dose Vitamin C? Vitamin C (aka. L-ascorbic acid or ascorbate) is a key nutrient that humans must ingest from food or any other dietary supplements. Vitamin C cannot be made in the body. When the body does not get enough Vitamin C, many of the key processes in the body begin to fail and the development of scurvy, lethargy and blood thinning occur. High Dose Vitamin C therapy is the infusion of a 'large load' of Vitamin C directly into the bloodstream to kick-start the physiological processes that prevent the conditions named above from occurring. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that prevents high levels of oxidative stress, one of the major causes for illness and disease. Free radicals (oxidative stress) jump around the body destroying DNA, thus causing mistakes when our cells replicate. What happens after [DNA is damaged inside of a cell](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4026755/) and the immune system is unable to detect the cell with damaged DNA? Oxidative stress occurs as a result of psychological, physical and environmental stress. It is also a natural process that occurs in our body when our mitochondria creates ATP from oxygen and water.
