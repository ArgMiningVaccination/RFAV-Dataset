Although the FDA is projected to add the new warning to the labeling for the vaccine, the agency still calculates the benefit of vaccination with the J&J product continues to outweigh the risk. Benefits include [protection against the Delta variant](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/954173) and serious COVID-19 outcomes. More than 100 cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a federal program for reporting vaccine issues, spurred the FDA to act. Men and people older than 50 appear to be at highest risk, according to reports of a July 12 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statement. The CDC also revealed that most cases occur about 2 weeks following immunization. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome often causes muscle weakness and sometimes temporary paralysis. Most people who develop the rare syndrome recover. Such was not the case for a 57-year-old man, The New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/us/fda-warning-johnson-johnson-vaccine-nerve-syndrome.html) Monday. He had a history of both a heart attack and [stroke](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1916852-overview) in the previous 4 years and died in April after vaccination with the J&J vaccine and developing Guillain-Barr\u00e9. The new warning comes in the wake of a number of setbacks for the company's COVID-19 vaccine. On April 13, the FDA and CDC both recommended a 10-day pause on administration of the J&J vaccine after reports of [rare blood clot events](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/949174) emerged. In mid-June, the FDA requested that Johnson and Johnson [discard millions of vaccine doses](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/952979) produced at a manufacturing facility in Baltimore. The mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are not affected by the new FDA warning. The Biden administration is expected to make a formal announcement of the new warning for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as early as Tuesday, the Times reports.
