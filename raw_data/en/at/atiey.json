Natural and peaceful. Organic and vegetarian meals. The treatments that are both healing and rejuvenating. My wife and daughter took a week long Ayurveda treatment of Shirodara and a few more. The doctors and staff are well versed in the art of Ayurveda medicines. They are highly dedicated to the cause and the patients. Even though a bit expensive but the treatment part is excellent and hygienic. I made an appointment with the Ayurvedic Doctor to have my pulse checked. As I was in silence retreat, I preferred not to speak. The doctor diagnosed my situation accurately. I was amazed as I didn't utter a singe word. She then recommended a 3-day massage treatments and herbal medications for 1 month. As with any doctor, sometimes they get it right, sometimes they don't. The massage treatments were rather sacred. The therapists said prayers before they commenced, giving me a feeling that the body and massage techniques were honoured and respected. After completing the 3-day massage treatments, I am glad to have the ache and pains in the body disappeared as they have been disturbing me for the past few months. Upon completing the 1-month medication, I felt good and well. So far it has been 4 months since I completed the course, the body is still in a wonderful state of balance with no aches & pain. This is my second try at Ayurveda. First time, many years ago to balance my digestive system and now for hormonal imbalance. Both times the results are positive and the issues have yet to recur. I am thankful for the healing and the ancient art of Ayurveda. Please give it a shot as the healing is down to the root cause and long-term. My sincere gratitude to all at Panchakarma. All in all, a pleasant and amazing experience. Few suggestions: 1) To improve the reception experience as the 2 ladies seems to have some communication issues compromising guests experience. Massage appointments over 3-days can't be confirmed at once, making it difficult for visitors without local number to plan schedule in advance. Always have to keep walking back to the reception to find out massage timing. 2) Also to have the fees officially published in a \"Fact Sheet\" to avoid miscommunication and wrong impression of mischarging. The hotel is clean, nice and peaceful. Staff is very slow. Something that strikes me: when it comes to prices of food and treatments it is never clear. None of the prices are written down in a brochure or elsewhere. Only after you check out you can have a clear idea of your bill. Something strange taking into account the nature of this organisation. i loved being there! we were there for a week! free wifi, organic food, and pancha karma treatments made it a complete package. the shuttle service was fantastic! I was scheduled to work in Kuala Lumpur during the third week in August and we wanted to find somewhere that was on the way back from Malaysia to England where we could have a complete rest for a week. Friends in London told us that there were some excellent Ayurvedic health venues in Bangalore so we started looking there online. My friend Kay, whose family originates from southern India had previously taken me to an Ayurvedic health weekend in England and I'd had a couple of Ayurvedic massages in Coventry, so I already had some appreciation and a lot of respect for Ayurveda which, having been around for more than 3,000 years, is the oldest health system in the world. When I told one of my work colleagues that I had booked to stay at Sri Sri Panchakarma, she was mightily impressed. \"Wow, that's run by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. He's a world famous Indian spiritual leader. I went to his meditation in London at the Royal Albert Hall last year. It was amazing!\" I'd never even heard of Ravi Shankar. We had booked the Panchakarma because we liked the reviews on TripAdvisor and in Outlook Traveller magazine. The drive from Bengaluru airport to the Panchakarma took about 90 minutes. We passed through the inner city bustle of Bangalore, through multiple sets of roadworks (the infrastructure investment in new roads and the metro is impressive) with lots of cows wandering across the traffic-laden urban roads. The contrast, as we left the city and drove into the lush open countryside where the Panchakarma is situated, was stark. We arrived at Sri Sri Panchakarma which is a self-contained unit, separated by a road from the massive ashram (properties and buildings housing a spiritual community) run by the Art of Living Foundation, established by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. Panchakarma is a purification therapy that takes place over several days. It's based on the Ayurvedic principle that when our energetic forces (doshas) known as vata, pitta and kapha get out of balance, it lowers our digestive fire (agni) and toxins (ama) are created. This is detrimental to our prana (life-force or energy), tejas (metabolic energy), and ojas (immunity). Panchakarma is a thorough cleanse that aims to detoxify the body and reduce the imbalances in the doshas that cause disease and discomfort, rather than just dealing with symptoms. Shortly after we arrived at the Panchakarma, we went for a consultation with the Ayurvedic doctor, Dr Gayathry. The consultation began with Naadi Pareeksha, an Ayurvedic pulse analysis that diagnoses physical, mental and emotional imbalances as well as diseases. Dr Gayathry told me that my prakruti (the constitutional balance that I was born with) is Vata. If the proportion of doshas in your current state is close to your prakruti, then your health will be vibrant. However, if your current state is different to your prakruti state, this imbalance can create disease and discomfort. Vikruti is the term used to describe this imbalance. My vikruti, as diagnosed by the doctor, is Vata Pitta. I looked up the characteristics of people with a Vata Pitta vikruti. They are described as highly mobile, talkative, having a friendly attitude, flair and individuality, highly creative with original ideas and a consistency to stick with the project to the very end. Yes, that sounds like me. Each evening, I received a programme of treatments for the next day, that the doctor had designed for me personally. In addition, I took Ayurvedic pills morning and evening to aid my detox and I was put on a strict Ayurvedic diet for the first couple of days (no spicy, curd, oily or fried items). Either Dr Gayathry or Dr Akhil came to check up on me every day, The doctors are in charge of both the therapists and the restaurant staff and nothing happens at Sri Sri Panchakarma without the doctor's say so. Typically, I had four treatments a day. I had the same therapist, Adheena, for all my treatments. She was very well trained and highly skilled. Everything had to be done in the proper way and the right order. Nothing was rushed. If it took longer than the allocated time on my schedule, so be it. I was supposed to have three hours of treatments each day but mostly it was nearer to four hours. For most of the treatments the only thing I wore was a couple of pieces of linen that were tied together like little sumo wrestling pants. After about day three I learnt to assemble my pants myself. At the start of each treatment session, the therapists sang a little blessing to me and at the end of the session, Adheena rubbed a peppery brown spice into my scalp and added red dots to my forehead and throat, as a further blessing to awaken my inner wisdom. I loved these touches. Over the six days I was undergoing Panchakarma, I had 18 different treatments. In the morning I got \"heavy duty\" massage treatments, involving hot oils imbued with herbs. There was Abhyangra with light rhythmic strokes for relaxation and Uzhicil, a deep tissue massage for improving circulation and toning the skin. Several of the treatments involved massage and pummelling of the skin with boluses (cloth balls) infused with hot oil and herbs or rice in milk. In the afternoon I had lighter treatments. There were beautiful Mukhalepa facial treatments where my face was cleaned with fresh milk and fresh papaya was applied. There was Shirodhara, a process to improve the functioning of the central nervous system, where medicated warm oil was continually streamed onto my forehead for 45 minutes. There was Marma, a light touch therapy to open up the blocks to energy across my body and enhance the flow of prana. Not all of the therapies were strictly Ayurvedic. For instance on my second day I had a Japanese treatment called Rakkenho where the therapist covered me with a sheet and stepped on me at key pressure points all over my body. All of the herbs that are used in the treatments are organically grown in the ashram and only ground up immediately before use. At first I found the smell of some of the medicated oils to be unpleasant. Either I got used to it or the smell improved as the week progressed. I spent many hours on the treatment table over the week. I didn't really think of anything most of the time I was lying there. I wasn't asleep but I went off to a very calm peaceful place, somewhere in my head. It is hard to describe. We ate three meals a day in the Sittvic restaurant as part of our Panchakarma programme. The food was outstanding. All the ingredients are organically grown on the ashram and are freshly prepared. It was much more protein light and carbohydrate heavily than what I would normally eat but I have probably never enjoyed eating vegetables so much. I've resolved to eat more vegetables when I get home. This the food we were served in the restaurant on 2nd September (I have also loaded photos): Breakfast: Poori bhaji sabzi, panchmel dal, grilled mixed vegetables, amara beans stir fry, curry leaf buttermilk served with red rice, Indian flatbread and boondi ladoo Dinner: Beet apple soup, Russian salad, nilgiri korma, grilled carrot and okra, bitter gourd stir fry, lentil gravy, served with pudina pulao and Indian flatbread We stayed at the Panchakarma guesthouse, the Meera Vanam. It's a beautiful building, with the guest rooms designed around a nadumuttam, a traditional courtyard style.The room was very comfortable with air conditioning and ceiling fans, a kettle for hot drinks, a laundry service, a hot shower and an internet connection that worked most of the time. The building was very clean, in fact it seemed to be being constantly cleaned the whole time we were there. There was a 24 hour front desk and the staff went out of their way to be helpful. To give an example, we had to get a flight back to London very early on Monday morning so we decided to stay in a hotel in central Bangalore the evening before. We booked a taxi to pick us up from the hotel via Anish from the front desk team at Meera Vanam. Anish got up at 3.30am to call us to make sure the cab had arrived at the hotel, even though we were no longer his guests. These are my reflections at the end of my stay: -I really appreciated the holistic approach, combining physical, mental and emotional aspects -This was as close to being a total detox as I would probably want. It was as much a tech detox (no television, radio, newspapers, far fewer phone calls and emails) as a physical and mental detox -I've enjoyed learning about Ayurveda as an approach to health -I've proved to myself that I can spend several hours a day lying still, doing nothing and I've never been able to do that before -I feel physically and mentally refreshed by the experience and I would definitely do Panchakarma again -I don't think that I will be abandoning conventional medicine for Ayurveda anytime soon but I can see that there are many benefits to its complementary approach I'm not someone who does yoga or meditates or spends a lot of time thinking about spirituality or other existential questions.I met a number of people at Sri Sri Ayurveda Panchakarma for whom these activities are the centre of their lives. I think I had just a good experience as they did, just in a different way. "}
