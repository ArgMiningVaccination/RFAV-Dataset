We never take lightly the fact that you've trusted us with your health\u2014and that's why all the supplements we carry go through a rigorous screening process by our quality standards experts. If we won't take it, you won't find it here. In fact, what you won't find on our shelves is as important as what you will find. We've put together a growing list of the most problematic supplement ingredients, many of which are still commonly found in supplements at other retailers and online\u2014but never here. As new research becomes available, an ingredient that might not have been considered problematic may now be an ingredient of concern or unacceptable.
