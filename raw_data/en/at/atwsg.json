Some websites contain current, authoritative, well-research information. Others sites offer out-of-date, misleading, or flat out false information. As such, it is especially important to be a critical consumer of information when locating sources on the open web. The Medical Library Association's guide to finding good health information online is directed towards patients and consumers, but is helpful for any web-user wishing to evaluate the health content they locate online. Health professionals may also benefit from reviewing the information outlined on the [Evidence-Based Practice](https://guides.nyu.edu/cam/ebp) section of this research guide. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is the Federal Government's lead agency for scientific research on complementary and integrative health approaches. It is 1 of the 27 Institutes, Centers, and Offices that make up the National Institutes of Health (NIH) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The mission of NCCIH is to determine, through rigorous scientific investigation, the fundamental science, usefulness, and safety of complementary and integrative health approaches and their roles in improving health and health care. The NCCIH website contains information for both consumers and health care professionals. "}
