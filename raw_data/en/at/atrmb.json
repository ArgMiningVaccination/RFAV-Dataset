Why should your child be vaccinated? 1 2 COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that can range from mild to severe disease. Spread is mainly through droplets, airborne particles, or touching contaminated surfaces. Symptoms appear 2 to 14 days after exposure, and can include fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, runny nose or loss of smell or taste. Complications can include respiratory failure, heart attacks, blood clots and other long-term problems. Children who get infected with COVID-19 can develop serious complications like Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). All vaccines used in Singapore comply with World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, and are assessed by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) to ensure quality, safety and efficacy standards are met. The overall safety profile of the Pfizer-BioNT ech/Comirnaty vaccine was observed to be comparable to that seen in adults and adolescents. Phase 3 trial done on 2,186 children showed very strong efficacy of 90.7% against symptomatic infection, and observed no serious adverse events related to vaccination for children. Both the HSA and the EC19V have assessed that the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNT ech/Comirnaty vaccine outweigh the risks when used in a paediatric dosage (10 micrograms) for children aged 5-11 years, especially in the current setting of ongoing community transmission. COVID-19 vaccination dosage of 10mcg for children 5-11 years old will be based on age, not weight of children. Safety and efficacy of vaccine for your child3 Vaccination can help reduce the risk of infection and severe disease in children. Children also spend a lot of time in schools or preschools where infections can spread quickly as they interact with other children. Vaccination will further reduce the risk of transmission in schools, and disruptions to education as well as co-curricular activities. It will also reduce the risk of transmission within households. 1 2WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE VACCINATING YOUR CHILD VACCINATES PROTECT ME3 4Who should or should not get the vaccine?6 Your child should NOT get this vaccine if he/she had a high risk allergic reaction (including anaphylaxis) to a prior dose of this vaccine if it occurred within 4 hours of vaccination, or if he/she has a known allergy to any ingredients in this vaccine such as Polyethylene glycol (PEG). If your child had an allergy or anaphylactic reaction to other vaccines,he/she CAN receive this vaccine without the need for an allergist's review. If your child has cancer and is on active chemotherapy, you should consult your child's cancer specialist on the best time for your child to be vaccinated. Children with weakened immune systems, either from illness or medication, may still receive the vaccine because it isn't a live vaccine (i.e. a vaccine that uses a weakened form of a germ or virus to prompt an immune response). It is even more important for them to be protected against COVID-19 infection. For children who had COVID-19 infection, they would be recommended for 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine 3 months after the infection. Does COVID-19 vaccine cause myocarditis or pericarditis?5 Severe allergic reactions of mRNA vaccines are rare. The national incidence rate of anaphylaxis for individuals aged 12-19 years is 0.40 per 100,000 doses. Serious health events like myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) are also rare. Majority of the individuals who developed myocarditis or pericarditis had mild disease, responded well to the treatment and recove red. In contrast, MIS-C (inflammation of multiple organs which can include the heart) after COVID-19 is more common (more than 60 per 100,000 persons infected). Risk Factors 4 The number of children who have been infected with COVID-19 has been increasing along with the number of community cases. Since 15 Oct 2021, more than 10,000 children aged 0-11 years had been infected with COVID-19. Risk factors for COVID-19 infection are young age, chronic co-morbidity, obesity and high inflammatory markers. Although children have a low risk of severe disease, some of those infected with COVID-19 have developed life-threatening disease and severe late complications, such as MIS-C and required treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU).ENSURE YOUR CHILD IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE VACCINATION6Pain, redness, swelling at the injection site Fever, chills Headache, muscle pain, joint pain Lymph node swelling at neck or armsSee a doctor if: The side effects persist or get worse. Heart or chest symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heart beats develop. In very rare cases, this vaccine can cause severe allergic reactions, including difficulty breathing, swelling of your face, throat, eyes or lips, a fast heartbeat, dizziness and weakness, a bad rash all over your body. If you ex perience a severe allergic reaction, seek medical attention immediately. Call 995 or go to the nearest A&E immediately. If you experience side effects after vaccination which are not listed above, please consult your doctor. Tiredness Those with fever are advised to self-isolate at home until the fever subsides. Paracetamol dosed according to the child's weight as needed. Usually gets better by itself in a week or soRestSide effects 8WHAT TO TAKE NOTE AFTER VACCINATION 5If you experience severe or unusual side effects, see your doctor, who will be able to advise you and report the side effects to HSA. You may also report side effects directly to HSA on a form by scanning this QR code. After Vaccination7 Advise your child to rest and avoid strenuous exercise for 2 weeks no jogging, swimming, cycling, school PE or sports. Your child might have side effects but of most of them would be mild or moderate, and usually get better within a few days. Use the appropriate dosage of paracetamol for your child's weight for pain/fever; avoid ketoprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac in the 1-2 days after vaccination. T o register your child for the COVID-19 vaccination, "}
