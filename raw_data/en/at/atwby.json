In time, she was granted political asylum. She eventually studied to become a nursing assistant, passed her certification exam, and got a job in a nursing home. The work was hard and didn't pay a lot, she said, but \"as an immigrant, those are the jobs that are open to you.\" (Andrews, 2/3) [ KHN: Montana Lawmakers Seek More Information About Governor's HEART Fund ](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/montana-lawmakers-seek-more-information-about-governors-heart-fund/) A fund championed by Gov.
