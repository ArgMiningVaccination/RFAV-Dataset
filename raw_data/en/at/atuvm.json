What was once only enjoyed in Buddhist monasteries of China and Tibet is now practiced the world over! TCM integrates spiritual beliefs with theories of life-force and bio-energetics, Qi ( or Chi, pronounced \"chee\"). Priests treated members of their communities with herbs, animal products, acupuncture, cupping (pressure cups applied to the back), and moxibustion (a warming herb that is 'smoked' along with meridian points). Needle acupuncture has to do with the insertion of thin, sterile needles along energy points of the body. This healing practice evolved from a discernment of energy meridian points along the skin's surface that correlates with organs like the lungs, liver, stomach, and kidneys. Furthermore, all forms of body disharmony, illness, and disease are effectively treated by restoring harmony to the qi along the meridians and thus healing organs and body systems. Western Medicine is currently looking into the ways in which TCM actually works. Modern science has developed the technology to detect and measure the subtle bio-energy and confirm the acupuncture points along the meridians. Although this research is still ongoing, Western medicine has acknowledged the positive health effects of TCM, particularly needle acupuncture. According to TCM, meridians traverse all tissues and organ systems of the body. Therefore, acupuncture can affect all aspects of health.
