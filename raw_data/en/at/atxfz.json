Following on the heels of the initial summit, which tookplace Jan. 11 at the AmericanAssociation of State Counsel-ing Boards Annual Conferencein Phoenix, 20 delegates from awide range of counseling orga-nizations met in Montr\u00e9al toidentify and discuss issues theybelieve must be addressed toensure the profession's futurehealth. Many issues were givenvoice, but one in particular spoke most clearly to those inattendance. \"I believe the majorissue that the counseling profes-sion identity,\"said the delegaterepresenting \"While we all identifyourselves as in it is clear that not allcounselors self-identify as coun-selors first and their specialtyarea second. ACA began as acoalition of organizations, andsome counselors believe thatmodel is how we should contin-ue to operate. I believe, as doothers, that we are all counselors first, that there is a core body ofknowledge and skills and a pur-pose that unites us (and that) weneed additional training andexperience to be effective in the(specialty) area in which wechose to practice. While thismay sound like a chicken-or-egg discussion, it lies at theheart of our profession. Are weone profession or many relatedprofessions under an umbrella?Until we decide this issue, it willbe hard for us to move ahead.

Eisenhower's People to People Ambas-sador Programs, will conduct a counseling delegation to RussiaMay 12-21. Twelve members of ACA, led by ACA Chief Pro-fessional Officer David Kaplan, will travel to Moscow and St.Petersburg to meet with counselors and representatives fromvaried mental health service venues, including the Russian Psy-chology Society, TRIALOG Counseling Center, Bekhterev Psy-cho Neurological Research Institute and the Humanitarian Gym-nasium #11, a school of 800 students. The 10-day journey will give the Western counselors a new perspective on Russian culture as well as the country's mentalhealth needs and treatment methods. At the Russian PsychologySociety, delegates hope to discuss and compare not only thecounseling professions of Russia and the United States but alsothe structures of the professional counseling organizations foundin each nation. Working at the TRIALOG center are experienced psycholo- gists and psychotherapists who are associates and members ofthe Department of Psychology at Moscow State University. Thecenter's theoretical basis is humanistic psychology and ontopsy-chology. The center offers many types of services, includingindividual counseling, Internet counseling, family counselingand group therapy. Next the delegates will tour the Bekhterev research institute, which is a unique, scientific practical facility with special clin-ics and laboratories that work to comprehensively develop theissues of psychiatry, neurology, neurosurgery, addictions, clini-cal psychology, psychotherapy and rehabilitation of patients. The final stop for the delegates is a meeting with school coun- selors at Humanitarian Gymnasium #11 in St. Petersburg. Dele-gates will get to witness firsthand the school counseling struc-ture as well as the counseling theories, approaches and tech-niques utilized in Russia. This is the fifth in a series of counseling delegations organized by ACA. This fall, ACA Past President Sam Gladding will leadthe next delegation to South Africa.

ILetters Reader offers additional observations about theChinese school system I was very interested to read Counseling Today's articleabout school counseling andcareer development in China(see \"Unveiling 2006). I have a master'sdegree in counseling psycholo-gy and am currently teachingpsychology at Hebei Universityin Hebei, China. I am interestedin staying in China at leastanother year, and I'm lookingfor a job that will help me whenit comes to applying to doctoralprograms. I have spent a lot of time with students in China discussing thepressures they face from societyand their parents. I have alsonoted a startling amount ofcheating taking place, much ofwhich is condoned, that seemsto result from this pressure. I'd like to make a few points related to your article. As for China becoming a bilingual country, signs arebeing replaced everywhere(radiating out from the majorcities) to read in Chinese charac-ters, Pin-yin and often English. Not only are children with severe emotional or learningproblems not placed in publicschool (as Kelly Duncan noted);you also don't tend to see chil-dren with any disabilities either.(There is a school for the deafhere in Baoding though.) From my perspective, the lack of discipline problems(also noted by Duncan) is basedon two things. First, the teach-ers actively try to entertain thestudents, especially in universi-ty. The second, and possibly bigger rea-son, is that they donot teach criticalthinking skills here.The students don'tcause trouble because,to they to deviate from thestandard. They're boredbut have the prescribedtechniques to use (sleep-ing or quietly studyingsomething more interest-ing while the teacher islecturing); they don't tendto employ novel ones thatwould get them into trou-ble. As the schools haveincreased the critical thinkingthey teach, they are facing moreand more of the discipline prob-lems we face in the West. To pass the national entrance exam to get into university or toenter graduate school, the stu-dents must pass an English lan-guage section. Scores on the testdo not in any way seem to reflectactual language ability. This is,in part, the same issue that facesall standardized tests \u2014 thequestion of how to measure whatyou are actually trying to mea-sure. If a student doesn't pass, itis seen more as the failure of theteacher than of the student. Thisplaces amazing pressure on theteachers themselves and has ledto a very relaxed attitude towardcheating. The students here have a ded- ication to learning that is rarelyseen in the United States. Theywork harder than any other stu-dents I have seen and are eagerfor an opportunity to learn more.The teachers, especially the younger ones, are all very eager to embrace new and betterteaching techniques, while try-ing to maintain the positiveaspects of the traditional system.They seek a balance of old andnew. If China can get its education- al system sorted out, it will veryquickly rise up to become oneof the most powerful countriesin the world. The people sup-port each other and almost alleffort is joint effort. Workinggroups and any sort of team-based effort (scientific collabo-ration, for example) will beincredibly effective here once amore advanced set of problem-solving skills is in place.Mark NicholsHebei University Hebei, China paragot@gmail.com ICounseling T oday IMay 2006 4 Counseling Today Staff Publisher Richard Yep 800.347.6647 ext. 231 ryep@counseling.org Editor-in-Chief Jonathan Rollins 800.347.6647 ext. 339 jrollins@counseling.org Senior Staff Writer Angela Kennedy 800.347.6647 ext. 320 akennedy@counseling.org Advertising Representative Kathy Maguire 317.873.1800 kmaguire@counseling.org Graphic Designer Carlos J.

From the President - BY PATRICIA ARREDONDO Counseling T oday IMay 2006 5The Dalai Lama has been known to say, \"When I meetpeople, I don't need introduc-tions. After all, we are all humanbeings.\" I felt this way as Imoved around at our inauguralinternational convention inMontr\u00e9al. There was a multicul-tural joie de vivre , a special sense of spirit and delight as wemoved from session to session,from headquarters hotel to theconvention center, and to thebustle of receptions and otherfestivities. This month's column is my retrospective on the annualAmerican Counseling Associa- tion Convention, which this yearalso included the CanadianCounselling Association. I hopethe photos in this issue (pictorialcoverage begins on page 41) willhelp those of you who did notattend to get a sense of the pow-erful energy of connectednessthat I experienced. I believe in the importance of recognizing the contributions ofindigenous peoples for allowingus to be on their land. However,at the convention, I was remissin not acknowledging theMohawk Nation, whose landspreads from northern New York into Canada. My sincerest apolo-gies for my error. Engaging the multicultural, humanitarian spirit It was a privilege to serve as ACA president during this trulymulticultural conference. Myfamily members joined me andparticipated in the learning andcelebrations. At our OpeningSession, Jos\u00e9 Cervantes of Cali-fornia State University-Fullertonled us through a mestizo ritual that signaled the opening of theconvention and also causedmany of us to feel a spiritual,heartfelt connection to oneanother. Using a conch shell, heblew to the four directions oflife, invoking the role of naturein our collective humanity. Theuse of Hawaiian leis engendereda sense of Ohana , or family. An American Indian, Morning Dove, stated poetically, \"...everything on the Earth has apurpose, every disease an herb to cure it, and every person a mis-sion. This is the Indian theory ofexistence.\" Through Dr. Cer-vantes' mestizo ritual, I felt a reconnection to my sense of pur-pose as a helper and as a leaderin a caring profession. The power of caring Among conference traditions are the Opening Sessions withour special keynote speakers.This year, Stephen Lewis andTipper Gore opened our heartsand minds to the spirit of human-itarianism across cultures andcontinents and to messagesabout family-centeredness beingessential to mental well-being. Stephen Lewis gave an impas- sioned speech about his work inAfrica with victims of theAIDS/HIV pandemic. I wasmoved by his stories of childrencaring for their dying mothers, ofgrandmothers becoming caretak-ers for entire villages of childrenand of the endless need for coffins to bury the victims of theAIDS/HIV scourge. His wordshad an immediate effect on oursensibilities as helpers, and Iknow that many of us feel com-pelled to \"do something.\" ACAwill take a leadership role aswell. Counselors care, and wewill respond. Thanks in large part to Tipper Gore, the profession of counsel-ing is validated. Through herpersonal story about clinicaldepression, she continues to helpdiminish the stigma surroundingmental health services. Herexamples of advocacy, particu-larly on behalf of the homeless,also resonate for counselors.Advocacy is a counseling skill. This year's convention theme was \"Culture-Centered andDiversity Counseling EmpowersAll Families.\" And for at least afew days, ACA and CCA came The beauty of multiculturalism in the counseling profession Continued on page 35La belleza del multiculturalismo/La beaut\u00e9 du multiculturalismeI am sure they share in my con- gratulations not only for all thatyou have accomplished so farbut, more importantly, for allyou will be doing as you workwith clients, help students,teach others, write books orconduct research. Many of youwho are graduating this monthwill be taking the profession ofcounseling into the middle ofthe 21st century. Much rides onyour shoulders if the professionis to thrive. I also want to let you know that ACA welcomes you to therank of professional member.However, we also realize thatyou may have a few collegeloans to pay back, so keep inmind that ACA does have a\"new professional\" category ofmembership. This will allowyou to pay student dues whilestill enjoying the benefits ofprofessional membership uponfirst graduating. ACA will also strive to be there for you when you needresources such as professionalpublications, information pack-ets, licensure information,answers to ethics questions, lia-bility insurance and career ser-vices. Ultimately, you will judge whether membership inthe largest organized body ofprofessional counselors issomething that makes sense foryou. I hope you will see value in continued membership inACA. But if you have anyquestions about that decision, Iencourage you to contact meand let me know about yourconcerns. I understand that it is tough right out of graduate school.You will be looking for a job,perhaps relocating to a new cityand simply trying to get onyour feet so you can finallytake the first steps in an incred-ible journey that you worked sohard to begin. However, I amconfident that the products andservices ACA is offering to younow (and new innovations thatwe'll offer in the future) willprove valuable to you \u2014 valu-able enough that you will wantto continue your membership. It may seem like a long way off, but I encourage you tomark next March on your cal-endar right now. That is whenyou will have the chance toattend your first ACA Annual Convention as a professionalmember. I hope you will find away to join thousands of yourcolleagues as they gather inDetroit from March 21-25. Youonly need to look through thisissue of Counseling Today and the coverage of the recent con-vention in Montr\u00e9al to get asmall taste of what the annualconvention offers. Let me close by once again congratulating the Class of2006 as you all begin what Ihope will be careers that aretruly enriching, both profes-sionally and personally. Yourhard work has already paid off,so remember to take a fewmoments to bask in the glow ofgraduation, because you cer-tainly deserve that. As always, I hope you will pass along any comments,questions or suggestions thatyou might have. Please contactme either via e-mail at ryep@ counseling.org or by phone at 800.347.6647 ext. 231. Thanks and be well. ICounseling T oday IMay 2006 6Let's hear it for the Class of 2006 The month of May is signifi- cant for thousands of AmericanCounseling Association mem-bers, as it will mark a milestonein their lives. I am referring, ofcourse, to May being the monthwhen many ACA student mem-bers complete their studies andgraduate with their master's ordoctoral degrees. While thismarks the completion of manylong hours of work, it is inmany ways the beginning ofyet another important chapterin the lives of these individuals. To those of you who are graduating this month (or next),I congratulate you for the dedi-cation, commitment and com-passion that you have demon-strated in obtaining your ad-vanced degree. In addition to the ACA staff and myself,many others wish you well. Forinstance, I know that ACAPresident Patricia Arredondohas made the support of gradu-ate students one of her primaryfocuses this year, and she cer-tainly acknowledges your ac-complishments. In addition,ACA President-Elect MarieWakefield has said that she willbe looking at the concept oflegacy when she assumes officein July. Your matriculation issomething that helps to rein-force that the counseling pro-fession does indeed have alegacy. And let's not forget the more than 50 past presidents of ACA. Executive Director's Message - BY RICHARD YEP Counseling T oday IMay 2006 7 Counseling T oday IMay 2006 8BY ANGELA KENNEDY Last month at the American Counseling Association/Cana-dian Counselling AssociationConvention in Montr\u00e9al, and the credential registry. licensure ments vary from state to state,licensure portability has beenan ongoing concern for li-censed professional counselorswho wish to practice in statesother than where they wereoriginally licensed. Currently,counselors who move out ofthe state in which they arelicensed cannot take that cre-dential with them. They mustapply for another license intheir new state of residency,which means they are facedwith the hassle of digging outold school documents, supervi-sor evaluations and test scoresto start the application processall over again. However, AASCB is en- gaged in talks with 20 states tochange their current licensurelaws to facilitate adoption theNational Credential Registry,will make it easier for licens-ing boards to allow counselorsto retain their license whenthey move. \"This has thepotential to be a very powerfultool to counselors, potentialemployers, state licensureboards and, ultimately, thepublic,\" said AASCB PastPresident Jim Wilson. The future of reciprocity lies in the hands of the state licens-ing boards. AASCB recog-nizes the many different statelicensure requirements and hasprovided its members withtwo options. Eligibilityrequirements for PortabilityPlan registrants will fall intoeither Group I or Group II,based on AASCB memberswho require 48 semester hours for licensure (Group I) or 60hours (Group II). For the com-plete list of Group I and GroupII requirements for mandatorysupervised hours and post-license experience, refer to theAASCB website at www. aascb.org . Once states designate them- selves either as a Group I orGroup II state, licensed coun-selors who previously prac-ticed in another state with thesame group designationwould no longer have to applyfor a new license when theymove in. \"Right now, portability is really difficult because of thewide variations and standardsamong the states, so we areworking hard to overcomethat,\" said AASCB President-Elect Barry states are tonegotiate with AASCB's plan,he explained that it would takeanother year for each state'sofficials to approve the regula-tion changes. \"We don't wantto mention exactly what states are working with us until theregulation has been adopted,\" hesaid. \"It's a delicate process. Wedon't want the Division of Con-sumer Affairs to be flooded withcalls. Until the regulations arefinal, there are no guarantees.But the more we get on board,the more will follow.\" Charter member discount for credential registry AASCB also used the conven- tion Education Session on\"Licensure Portability: to announce National CredentialRegistry charter appli-cation for convention attendeesas well as ACA members whowere unable to attend. The National Credential Reg- istry is a service where, for a fee,counselors can house informa-tion about their education andwork history. The registry isessentially a centralized, elec-tronic filing cabinet that protectsa counselor's professional docu-ments and educational data,including college transcripts,supervision documentation, of recommendation, resumeand continuing education cred-its. When necessary, individualsmay request their records fromthis hub location rather thancontacting various relevantagencies to round up the neededinformation. The registry will bebeneficial to students, recentgraduates and licensed profes-sionals. It will also make it moreconvenient when counselorswant to move and take theirlicense with them, access cre-dentials at a later time or applyfor an additional credential orcertification. The National Credential Reg- istry's charter member applica-tion fee of $150 is available untilMay 31. Effective June 1, thefee will increase to $200. Indi-viduals who remit a $50 pre-payment now will be \"locked in\" to the discounted price.Applicants will have until Dec.31 to collect and submit theirNational Credential Registryapplication and initial credentialdocuments (counselors onlyneed to begin the process of sub-mitting their credentials by Dec.31). The remaining $100 of theapplication fee will be due atthat time. This allows coun-selors and students to commit tothe application process now,while still having a generousamount of time to complete theapplication, collect documenta-tion and save the additional$100 for the final payment. \"I like to use this illustration,\" Wilson said. \"An individualapplied for licensure inDelaware. He was a psychother-apist, worked for child protec-tive services (and) child advoca-cy, and he was a U.S. Marine. Hehad a master's in counselingpsychology and a doctorate inpsychology. He was a memberof five professional societies andhad three professional certifica-tions, including NBCC (Nation-al Board for Certified Coun-selors). He worked for 10 yearsin one organization under onesupervisor. The problem was henever sought licensure in anystate, and he was unable to locatehis clinical supervisor. He pro-vided the board with affidavitsof diligent searches for hissupervisor but couldn't even findout if the supervisor was dead oralive.

Graduate Student Association Task Force Co-Chairs Renee A.Middleton and Hugh Cretharwere recruited, along with sev-eral graduate students and pro-fessionals from various univer-sities, to help with the effort. Atthe ACA Convention in Mon-tr\u00e9al, the Graduate StudentAssociation team hosted the firstGraduate Student Summit toannounce its mission statement,gain student support and gatherfeedback from attendees. Arredondo kicked off the event by addressing the graduatestudents in attendance. \"I recog-nize how necessary it is for thementoring as well as the engage-ment of all of you in ACA, andengagement happens by havingthis summit and providing opportunities for graduate stu-dents to feel they are making acontribution,\" she said. \"Thefuture of ACA lies with all grad-uate students, but it is alsodependent on professionals whohave been graduate students andknow the journey of a graduatestudent and know what it meansto be embarking on your career.\"She added that many profession-als within ACA are activelycommitted to helping studentsfind their way in the association. \"I believe GSA will become a permanent part of the ACA orga-nizational structure,\" Arredondosaid. \"Its mentoring opportu-nities. We also want divisionsand regions of ACA to have theGSA be a destination point forstudents interested in specialtyareas as well. I see GSA evolv-ing to include interest groupsbased on specialties and alsoinclude an international studentinterest group.\" Courtland Lee, a past ACA president, also provided to the students. \"Iattended my first ACA confer- ence as a graduate student in1975 in New York,\" he said.\"What I remember about thatconference as a graduate studentwas that I was a volunteer. I real-ly didn't know what I was get-ting myself into, but I rememberhelping out in the sessions, and Igot to actually meet the peoplethat I was reading about in myclasses. Here I was face-to-facewith some of the giants in thefield, and I realized that thesepeople weren't just names on thecovers of books, but they werereal live human beings and regu-lar people. It was an eye-openingexperience.\" Lee said those initial encoun- ters with counseling's Who'sWho hooked him, and he knewfrom that point on that he want-ed to be a part of ACA. \"Afterthat,\" he continued, \"I got realinvolved, and I believe that I'veattended every conference sinceabout 1979. As a part of that,I've come through the ranks soto speak. At my first confer-ence, I was a runt as a graduatestudent volunteer, then I be-come involved in several lead-ership positions as a youngassistant professor, and it justblossomed from there \u2014 com-mittees, task forces, divisionpresident and, ultimately, it ledto me being elected president ofACA in 1997. So as I lookaround the room, I see brightand chipper faces and perhapssomewhere in this room a futurepresident of ACA.\" Lee exhorted the students to get involved in ACA as much aspossible. \"We need your ideas,your energy and your youth asACA moves forward,\" he said.\"Take leadership opportunitiesand use ACA and its resourcesto really help you grow as a pro-fessional. ACA is here to helpnurture your skills as a profes-sional counselor and your skillsas a leader.\" Developments so far \"The task force has already made much headway towardcreation and development of aGraduate Student Association,\"said task force member AmneyHarper. \"One of the short-termgoals of the task force is to haveall graduate students automati- cally become members of theGraduate Student Associationwhen they sign up for ACA stu-dent membership. This involve-ment would result in direct con-nection with other ACA com-mittees, including the Inter-Professional Committee, to sup-port and further the goals andmission of ACA. Additionally,as graduate students, we wouldbe encouraged to become moreinvolved in ACA, which in turnwould provide opportunities forour professional developmentand leadership. This would alsosupply an opportunity for us tomake significant contributionsto the life of ACA.\" Harpernoted that this process wouldmake the transition from studentto professional membershipmuch easier. \"We believe that getting grad- uate students involved in ACAthrough our own (organization)will benefit not only graduatestudents but also the professionthrough empowering future pro-fessionals,\" she said. \"But tosucceed in our mission, we willneed the collaboration of profes-sionals and graduate students.\" To tailor bylaws and provi- sions to best suit students,Graduate Student AssociationTask Force members created anonline needs assessment sur-vey, which is still availablethrough the ACA website atwww.counseling.org/students . The survey allows counselingstudents across the nation totake an active part in shapingtheir organization. At the convention, the Gradu- ate Student Association TaskForce also presented its pro-posed mission statement: \"The Graduate Student Asso- ciation is to be a voice for coun-seling students in ACA and thecounseling community and tofacilitate and promote a suc-cessful transition from graduatestudent to professional coun-selor practitioner and/or educa-tor.

I mean a real family, like the one Ihungered for when I watched The Waltons, Little House on the Prairie or The Cosby Show. But doing a genogram for one of my classes was a painful reminder of the fam-ily that I did have. As I stared at the circlethat was supposed to represent me, I wasconfronted by the truth behind the discon-nected lines that were running all over thepaper. I felt disconnected not only frommy family but from my peers and, sad tosay, even from myself. As a child I rarely spoke. Deep down I felt that I was different from the otherkids. But I didn't have time to sit andthink about my inability to make friends; I had too many responsibilities at home. Iwas the little mother because my ownmother lived at her job where she workedas a maid. I rarely saw her, but I neverthought that was a problem when I was achild. Sometimes I was happy that shewas gone because I didn't want to hearher scream or watch my father drag herout of the house like a log that was tooheavy for him to carry. Maybe that's whyI lost my voice \u2014 because if I madefriends, maybe then they would know thatmy father beat up my mother. Then whowould want to be my friend? With my mother gone, I was the one myfather chose to shoulder the responsibil- ity of taking care of my two younger sis-ters and my older brother. My father wasalways gone, so that meant we rarelyate. Oh, we'd find food \u2014 perhaps half-eaten fruit people had thrown in thestorm drains on the streets or in theneighbors' trash cans. My fatherworked, but we saw a few pennies onlyif we stole them while he slept. He fre-quented the pub down the street andwould leave only when he was soakingdrunk. Food was not his priority, so welearned how to survive many days with-out it. When we did have a meal, Ilearned to eat very slowly. Who could I talk to about this? There was no one. Besides, if I had foundsomeone and Daddy discovered it, he'dprobably have beaten me like he did mymother. My father was unpredictable inhis behavior. Many times he would beatus for no reason. He would often beat usuntil there were huge tracks of welts onour bottoms and legs. I covered the scarswith lots of clothing. What made this even sadder was that we weren't allowed to cry during thebeatings. I had to take the beating whilegrinding my teeth. If I made any sound ofdiscomfort, the beating would go on end-lessly. After my father beat us, he wouldhave us kneel down in front of him just tomake sure that we didn't go off to cry.The next day, he would act cheerful, as ifnothing had happened the day before. Henever told us he was sorry; he nevershowed us any affection. I grew up think-ing that it was normal for a father to beatnot only his wife but also his kids. As I experienced bits of my father's violent behavior, I was learning some-thing \u2014 how to suppress every emotion.I was learning that I would be punishedif I showed anger, and I couldn't showlove because I wasn't sure what that was. With my mother now gone, my father also chose me to sleep with him. He saidmy sister could have the bunk bed forherself. I thought that was fine until hestarted touching me in areas I didn't yethave words for. All I knew was thatdaddy was hurting me \"down there.\" Itold him he was hurting me. He wouldoften respond, \"That's OK. Just don'ttell anyone.\" In the morning he wouldact cheerful, so I started thinking some-thing was wrong with me. This must bewhat daddies do to their daughters, so Ishould be happy about it. I must be hisfavorite because I get to sleep in his bed. Confusion soon became acceptance. I had no idea that what he was doing to mewas wrong, although something alwaysfelt strange about my father being happyin the morning because he was almostnever happy about anything. Still, Ibelieved that I was the one being stupid because all daddies did this with their lit-tler girls. So I created a world where Iwas silent because that was my way ofprotecting Daddy. And that was also myway of protecting myself \u2014 exactlyfrom what I didn't know. I didn't feel connected to anyone at home. No one noticed that I was actingdifferent, but I certainly felt differentinside. I now know that I was reallydepressed as a child. I was withdrawnand many times thought about killingmyself. I was walking around with ahuge hole in my soul. That hole gotdeeper the day my mother took mesomewhere and dropped me off. I sawher talking to a woman who later tookmy hand and led me away to a room withother kids. I started screaming at the topof my lungs, \"Don't leave me, Mommy!Don't leave me!\" She never lookedback. I saw my mother walking out ofmy life again, and it was terrifying. I feltso alone with these people I didn't evenknow. I later learned it was school. At school, like home, I learned not to challenge authority. If I got a spanking atschool, I would also get one at home tomatch it. I soon forgot what my fatherwas doing to me at home because I wasmeeting new friends. I didn't tell themDaddy's secret though. I chose two orthree students to hang out with, and Ibecame a clown. I made silly faces andwould often talk when the teacher wastalking. I was told, in no uncertain terms,that I would have to remain silent; thatwas what good girls did. So I stopped talking at home and at school. If I was angry, I couldn't tell any-one or even show it. I respected myelders like I was \"taught.\" I once told mymother \"no\" for something; the scar shegave me on my knee was a reminder notto say \"no\" again. My mother also hit mewith a broom that had a wire on it, notbecause I raised my voice or yelled ather but because I challenged her by say-ing no. What I learned that day wasnever to question an adult. In school we weren't allowed to ask questions unless the teacher inquired ifwe had any. These messages from adultsto keep my mouth shut at all timesbecame a part of who I was. I recallneeding to use the bathroom in elemen-tary school, but I was afraid to raise myhand to be excused. So I pooped in mypants and sat through the entire class.How disturbing it is for me to rememberthis incident. I quit talking because I thought I was a problem. It reached the point wherepeople thought I was dumb. I was scaredof growing up mainly because I was ter-rified of having to learn new words. I How I lost my voice and found it again how free I felt in those moments, and that is where I found the strength to survive. I have chosen many paths, but I always come back to something in my heart thatpulls me toward being a counselor. I firstneeded to find out who I was, so my jour-ney began when I started to read. It waswhile reading a book that I found outabout incest. I could finally put a name towhat I had experienced as a child. I foundother answers in books as well. It was(and is) in training to be a counselor that Ilearned to love myself. Above all else,that is the gift I want to share with myclients. No matter what people are goingthrough, my desire is to help them seehow beautiful they really are and toaccept that their traumas do not makethem less of a person. Most people would never be able to tellwhat my story was by looking at me today because I do not carry myself likethe lost child I was growing up. I lockedall my secrets of abuse in a closet, but thetruth was that I was hiding in there withthem. I cried many nights locked in thatcloset \u2014 hungry, beaten, bruised and sex-ually abused. It was during my journey to becoming a counselor that I found my voice. It's avoice I intend to use to help others findtheir own way.

Submit columns for consideration to jkottler@fullerton.edu .didn't understand what sexual abuse was, but I knew it made me feel differentfrom the other kids, so I decided to stayaway from them. Growing up in my world was lonely. It seemed as if I was wearing a sign thatinvited men to rape and molest me. Per-haps I was simply easy prey because theyknew I wouldn't talk about what theywere doing. They were right; I never did. I found peace by the sea, which is where I also asked many questions ofGod. But I felt He was just like mebecause He never spoke. Time passed,and I put my experiences of abuse in acloset, vowing never to tell anyone. Italked to people when I got to knowthem, but I never shared the truth aboutmyself. I was scared that if they saw howdirty I was, they would leave me. Ilearned to look outside myself for love and caring, always seeking these thingsfrom other people. People would tell meI was beautiful, but for me this was a lie.If they knew my secret, they would seehow ugly I was. I would often sit by the sea and wonder if there was another child like me. WhenI watched other kids play, I questioned iftheir daddies were doing the same thingsto them that mine was doing to me, but Inever asked. Later I read in one of mytextbooks about the resiliency of kids,and I thought about myself. Yes, I wasresilient, and many of my moments ofhope came from nature. I felt such a pos-itive connection when I went to thewoods to collect firewood and listen tothe birds, or when I sat by the sea staringat the sky and the waves. I remember Counseling T oday IMay 2006 14BY STACY NOTARAS MURPHY One of Tony Brunswick's clients was wrestling with the\"higher power\" component ofhis substance abuse recoveryprogram. The client struggledwith his concept of God andorganized faith traditions, mak-ing his 12-step-style recoverymore difficult. Brunswick, anAmerican Counseling Associa-tion member who is a counselorat the So Others Might Eat Jor-dan House program in Washing-ton, D.C., suspected that hisclient might appreciate a visualtool to help him map the originof this conflict. \"We used a timeline to illus- trate his spiritual journey,\"Brunswick explained. \"Therewas a lot of activity during hisearly childhood. We also createda 'loss line,' which incorporatesall the significant periods of life. When we putthe two timelines together, werealized that there were a lot ofabuse-related issues when hewas young and that the abusewas perpetrated by people in hischurch. On the spiritual time-line, we saw a lot of spiritualexperiences occurring at thesame time as the abuse. You could just see on the paper thatthe conflict was visible, but yetit had gone unnamed for him forso long.\" The client had never before considered that during the timehe was enduring abuse, hesimultaneously had experiencedstrong faith in God. \"His under-standing of God was very mas-culine, authoritative and veryabusive,\" Brunswick said.\"With the timeline, he was ableto make the connection thatsome of the role models of faithfor him were some of the perpe-trators of the abuse. His abilityto establish a relationship withGod has been difficult becausethe imagery he uses to under-stand God also is very mascu-line. As a result of the timelines,he realized that there was a lotof connection between his con-flicted God images and hisexperiences with abuse when hewas young.\" Spiritual assessment tech- niques such as the spiritualitytimeline can serve as an entry-way for counselors to begin con-versations about faith and mean-ing making in their clients' lives.Counselors may use a growingbody clients'spiritual development, includingself-awareness andonline surveys. Specific toolscan be as formal as research-based assessment scales andinventories or as simple as draw-ing a family tree that includesspiritual events and overtones. Research suggests that coun- seling clients are open to thiskind of discussion. A 2000 sur-vey commissioned by the Amer-ican Association of PastoralCounselors and the SamaritanInstitute found that 83 percent ofAmericans believe their spiritualfaith and religious beliefs areclosely tied to their mental andemotional health. Further, 75percent of respondents said itwas important to see a profes-sional counselor who integratedtheir values and beliefs into thecounseling process. AAPC President Anne Ross Stewart, a member of ACA, sug-gested that the rising interest inspiritual assessment techniquesparallels the increasing interestin pastoral perspectives in thetraditional counseling world.\"Many students in pastoralcounseling programs today havenot had a degree in theology, andmany do not even intend to getone,\" Stewart said. \"They don'thave the background of some ofthe theological and spirituallenses that one might acquire inseminary education such as pas-toral diagnosis or inquiry, whichmight be more comparable towhat is understood in the main-stream as 'spiritual assessment.'Most traditional counselors, andeven some pastoral counselors,are trained today without a theo-logical background and, there-fore, may not have as many'windows' to get into the spiritu-ality of the clients. I think that ispart of why these assessmenttools are coming into play moreand more.\" Questions open the door While the list of available spiritual assessment techniquesranges from the casual to thecomplex, Carol Fournier's fa-vorite is quite basic. \"I reallythink it's essential,\" explained Fournier, a board member of theAssociation for Spiritual, Ethi-cal and Religious Values inCounseling, a division of ACA,\"to just be asking the questions:What gives meaning to yourlife? Do you believe in an ulti-mate reality? How would youname this? What does this meanto you? What is the foundationfor your values and some ofyour choices?\" Fournier, an assistant profes- sor at the University of Vermont,said many people have both pos-itive and negative experiencesof religion and spirituality, andlearning about those episodescan be critical to understandinga client's mental health. \"Any-thing you don't bring into acounseling situation gives theimpression that someoneshouldn't be talking about it orthey may not think to talk aboutit, and yet it might be having astrong influence on how they areliving their lives,\" she said. \"I've found it's really impor- tant to spend time flushing outwhat that story is in someone'slife,\" she continued, \"because itreally permeates all aspects,either consciously or uncon-sciously. I think the more ques-tions that can be asked ... theeasier it is to see its impact andto support someone in their over-all movement toward health andhealing. I think it's a disservicenot to ask those questions,whether that's choosing to use amore elaborate assessment toolor simply to bring the questionsinto the initial interview. It'samazing the responses you getjust by (saying), 'Tell me a littlebit about your experience of reli-gion.' There's just a lot of storyunderneath those questions.\" The four stages of faith development Once a counselor has asked those questions, however, it canbe helpful to have some knowl-edge of a theoretical model forinterpretation. Brian Griffith, anassistant clinical professor in theDepartment of Human andOrganizational Development atVanderbilt University, created aDivine interventions Spiritual assessment techniques meet mainstream counselingCounseling T oday IMay 2006 15religious identity status model that applies James Marcia'sidentity formation model to afaith perspective. The four stages of identity status are: IDiffusion, when there is no clear understanding or a lackof motivation IForeclosure, when a superfi- cial religious identity isadopted IMoratorium, which is a time of significant questioningand searching IAchievement, which is char- acterized by commitmentand spiritual maturity By asking specific questions about religious practice andconceptualization, counselorscan assess a client's stage offaith development and tailorinterventions based on thatknowledge. \"The religious identity status model is a process model,\"Griffith said. \"It assesses peo-ple's faith based on where theyare in a process; it's not judg-mental. Other assessment toolslook at things like content (whatdo you believe) and practices(how often do you go to churchor synagogue). This model ismore process-oriented, andthat's a little less threatening.The goal is to have the personfind their own belief system,integrate it into their own iden-tity (and) to live more faithfullyto their core spiritual center.The counselor is not definingthat core spiritual center but justfacilitating the process for theclient to get here and live con-sistently with that.\" Griffith noted that religious identity formation is not perma-nent. For example, clients mayreach one stage and then spinback into the searching processof moratorium following spe-cific life events such as births,deaths or divorces. \"We re-evaluate our spiritual beliefsystem,\" he said. \"To furtherrefine it, my faith at age 44 iscertainly different from what itlooked like at age 24. For me,in some ways the more I know,the less I understand and themore complex and nuanced itbecomes.\" Counselors can usethe stages to help conceptualizea client's situation and deter-mine appropriate interventions. Sincere social science Still, for many, the warning to steer clear of religion and poli-tics at family gatherings alsoapplies in the counseling room. There, counselors may be con-strained by the rules of theiremployer, while clients may notsee a connection between theirfaith experience and their cur-rent functioning. Ralph L. Pied-mont, an ACA member who isdirector of doctoral research forthe Department of PastoralCounseling at Loyola College inMaryland, set out to discover anew way to talk about spirituali-ty that would not get boggeddown by political correctness ordenominational doctrine. \"One of the problems of working in the field of spiritual-ity and religiosity is that it oftenreflects a very specific religiousorientation, such as the orienta-tion that is modal for the UnitedStates,\" he said. \"But it leavesout a lot of people, like Jews,Hindus, Muslims and peoplewho don't have religion but con-sider themselves to be very spir-itual or who may have a spiritu-ality that doesn't fit into any ofthe above categories. Whatabout their spirituality? Wheredoes that fit in? How do I mea- sure that, and how do I workwith these individuals?\" Piedmont continued, \"Our goal in developing our measureof spirituality was not to bedenominationally based. So weasked the question, what is itthat all religions seem to have incommon about their spirituali-ty?\" His research team gatheredrepresentatives from a variety ofreligions to take part in an\"interfaith conferencein 1997. said, \"which seemedto be the point of commonalityfor all faiths in that our religiousbeliefs are basically trying tohelp us step outside of ourimmediate sense of place andtime and to recognize thatthere's a bigger process goingon beyond who we are. \"Spiritual transcendence is the ability of the individual to stepback and construct a broad senseof united meaning and purposefor their lives; they recognizethat there is some transcendentreality out there that seems to provide an organizing frame-work for a person's life. ... Thatbasically means, since we knowthat we are going to die, how dowe make sense of the life we'releading? That's essentially theessence of all spirituality \u2014 trying to answer that question.\" Utilizing this new concept, Piedmont developed a spiritualtranscendence assessment thatis known as the ASPIRES scale(Assessment of Spirituality andReligious Sentiment). It mea-sures both spiritual transcen-dence and religious involve-ment. The survey tool offersboth long and short formats,and may how the meaning. Talkingabout that is what therapy is allabout. Giving the instrument isopening the door (and) tellingthe client that it's OK to talkabout these themes. Spiritualityis a long continuum, from peo-ple who are very materialistic to people who are transcendentand people who fall somewherealong that continuum. The scalegives a therapist some idea ofwhere a client is on that contin-uum so they can engage theclient where he or she is at.\" The scale has been used to predict outcomes in substanceabuse recovery programs, inwork with chronic arthritis suf-ferers and around the worldwith a vast list of cultures. \"Agroup of people is using it withMesoamericans who are gayand HIV-positive,\" Piedmontsaid. \"They liked the scale be-cause it captured aspects ofMesoamerican spirituality thatseem to have been left out inmore Christian approaches. Thethings about connectedness andhonoring the dead, havingongoing relationships with peo-ple who have died \u2014 those areimportant themes for thosefolks.\" Christian fundamentalists, on the other hand, have generally Continued on page 49 Counseling T oday IMay 2006 16In today's schools, students are faced with numerous andvaried sources of stress, frombullying to testing requirementsto the aftermath of natural andmanmade disasters. On March21, the American CounselingAssociation co-sponsored thefirst Senate briefing on school-based mental health servicesand their link to student success. \"Removing Barriers to Learn- ing: The Role of School-Employed Mental Health Ser-vice Providers\" addressed howschool counselors, school psy-chologists and school socialworkers eliminate barriers tolearning by helping studentsimprove their academic achieve-ment, develop interpersonal andsocial/emotional skills and pre-pare for positive postsecondaryopportunities. The briefing, co-sponsored by the AmericanSchool Counselor Association,the National Association ofSchool Psychologists and theSchool Social Work Associationof America, had bipartisan sup-port from Sens. Edward Ken-nedy (D-Mass.) and PeteDomenici (R-N.M.). The brief-ing was planned and organizedby Chris Campbell in ACA's Office of Public Policy and Leg-islation and lobbyists fromASCA, NASP and SSWAA.Connie Garner and ChrisCollins, staff members forKennedy and Domenici, respec-tively, spoke at the briefing,which was very well attended bystaff from other congressionaloffices. ACA Executive Director Richard Yep introduced the pan-elists, which included ASCAPresident Barbara Blackburn, amember of ACA. Other pan-elists included John 2003School of the Year;Randy Fisher, executive directorof SSWAA; of School in Va.; and Patricia G.Renie, parent of a student atWestfield High School in Chan-tilly, Va. \"If we really want to ade- quately prepare our youth to besuccessful in the real world,\"Yep said, \"we must have appro-priately trained and preparedmental health professionalsworking in our schools. In orderto do this, public policymakersat the local, state and federal level must understand whatresources are necessary to makethis happen, which is why wewere so pleased that Sens.Kennedy and Domenici werewilling to host the Capitol Hillbriefing. It is critical that publicpolicymakers understand theemerging role of school-basedmental health services. Schoolsare no longer just a place toacquire knowledge;they are social, emotionaland 'street smart' experiencesare gained.\" Said Kelly, \"It is going to take a serious recognition by ourcountry and educational systemthat a child's emotional well-being is not separate and apartfrom their education. On thecontrary, school-based mentalhealth services are an integralpart of a child's education, aswell as the continuum of ser-vices designed to meet chil-dren's emotional needs.\" Blackburn pointed out that research shows students whoreceive social-emotional sup-port and prevention servicesachieve at higher levels. Shenoted that a recent longitudinalstudy provided strong empiricalevidence that interventionswhich strengthen students'social, emotional and decision-making skills have a strong cor-relation to higher standardizedtest scores and better grades. \"Professional school coun- selors implement comprehen-sive, developmental programsthat promote and enhance acad-emic andsocial and careerplanning for all students,\" \"These programs provideeducation, prevention and inter-vention services, which areintegrated into all aspects ofstudents' lives. Despite criticalstaffing shortfalls in someschools, districts and states,school counselors work daily toprovide support and assistanceto all students. School coun-selors are committed to getting this message out and to workingwith stakeholders at every levelto improve the schools for thestudents of today who willbecome the adults and leadersof tomorrow.\" The briefing was part of plan- ning for the upcoming reautho-rization of programs at the Sub-stance Abuse and Mental HealthServices Administration and theNo Child Left Behind Act. Pan-elists emphasized that childrenneed public policy that: IExpands and improves school-based mental healthservices IEnhances coordination and leadership between the Sub-stance Abuse and MentalHealth Services Administra-tion and the Department ofEducation IStreamlines funding to follow children's needs IProvides funding for adequate numbers of highly trained,school-employed providers IProvides funding incentives such as loan forgiveness pro-grams to reduce shortages inthese professions IFocuses on evidence-based programs and interventions \"School counselors are now in a position to take a leading rolein structuring school programsto more adequately meet theneeds of students by includingother mental health providers asneeded,\" Blackburn added. \"It isextremely important that wework together, not separately.Speaking with one vision andone voice is a must. We must letour national legislators knowthat we need well-trained mentalhealth providers in the school towork with the whole child.\" Campbell and his colleagues at ASCA, SSWAA and NASPare building on the success ofthis briefing by working toincrease policymakers' recogni-tion of the importance ofschool-based mental health ser-vice providers.

In last month's issue we looked at the application of drumtherapy in structured or clinicalsettings. With the increased uti-lization of drumming applica-tions in the world of therapy, onemight assume an abundance ofresearch also exists that probesexactly why these interventionswork so well. Specifically, howdo drums affect the brain, andhow do rhythms alter our physi-ology? Surprisingly, such empirical research is very sparse. Neurol-ogist Barry Bittman, director ofthe Mind-Body Wellness andneurological function is itsinfancy. ... We're just beginningto understand the mind andmusic.\" Ultimately, we find onlyscattered pieces of relevantresearch. We'll touch on someof that research later, but firstlet's reflect on a time beforepeople used terms such as \"neu- rons\" and \"brain waves,\"because the drum's longbefore PET scans and MRIs. Weneed only look to our ancestorsto discover just how fundamen-tal the drum is to human culture. Indigenous cultures have tapped into the spiritual andcommunicative power of thedrum for tens of thousands ofyears. Drums were originallycreated using natural materialssuch as animal skin and wood,making them perhaps the oldestmusical instruments in humanhistory. Tribes have used drumsto communicate with each other,the spirit world and even theperson within because therhythms a person generates areoften a very accurate representa-tion of the player. Medicinally,shamans were the primary usersof the drum as a healing instru-ment. Lou Farley, a licensedprofessional counselor andmember of the American Coun-seling Association who usespercussion to supplement talktherapy in his private practice,said that a shaman would use thenatural vibrations and forces ofthe drum to \"move the energy orspirit of the ill person,\" these ills being physical or mental. Drumtherapy may be the oldest formof psychotherapy in existence. Thousands of years after indigenous cultures first inte-grated percussion into healingpractices, it appears that theWestern world of psychothera-py is also beginning to \"discov-er\" the drum's healing powers.Carl Jung was initially skepticalupon learning that certain thera-pists were incorporating musictherapy into their practice. Butlate in his life, Jung met Mar-garet Tilly, who incorporatedmusic therapy into an analysisof Jung. In directly witnessingthis power, Jung noted thatmusic should be incorporatedinto alltherapies. Jung came to believe that music was a projec-tion of unconscious motives andthat it could probe aspects ofpersonality that were not acces-sible via talk therapy. Asresearcher Carl Seashore noted,\"All rhythm is primarily a pro-jection of personality.\" With the drums, sounds can represent certain emotions ormay tap into a memory. Simi-larly, Patricia Skar has foundthat \"analysands seem to intu-itively choose instrumentswhich enable them to return toor enact a repressed aspect ofthemselves.\" In short, drumsprovide an elegant way to sortout the disorganization of ourunconscious. Farley has a slightly different outlook here. In my conversa-tion with him, Farley first fo-cused on the walls, or resistance,that people build as protectivepatterns in their lives. He notedthat these habituated and prac-ticed behaviors are easily acces-sible to clients during talk thera-py. But when a drum is in-volved, he said, \"It moves thedialog away from those usualpatterns of protection, and(clients) are no longer able toaccess their usual defenses.\"This results in a very clearexpression of the client's trueself. In fact, Farley takes thisone step further. He believesthat, especially in the stripped-down context of the drum, peo-ple are unable to lie about whothey truly are. So how does this work with the drum? Enter the counselor.Farley asserts that it is the coun-selor's responsibility to \"tuneinto\" the frequencies generatedby the client. These frequenciesare a pathway that leads direct-ly to the client's heart. To dothis, the counselor must havegreat self-awareness. For exam-ple, counselors who utilizedrums in session need to have an intimate understanding ofhow they feel, not only whenproducing certain patterns onthe drums but also in their dailyliving. This will allow them tomake accurate inferences aboutthe client's world. What the research shows Let's go back to the research about drums and their effectson the brain. Again, the re-search is scant, but it has pro-vided some promising leads. Inparticular, the brain seems tomimic the rhythmic nature ofthe drum. It is not new knowledge in the world of neurochemistry that thebrain has a fundamentally rhyth-mic nature. The coordinated andrepetitious firing of our neuronsis an unmistakable indication ofthe brain's nature as a percus-sionist. So it should come as nosurprise that the brain respondsremarkably well to a rhythmicstimulus from the outside world. Connie Tomaino of the Insti- tute for Music and NeurologicalFunction has conducted researchwith people who have weak orabnormal brain rhythms. She hasfound that when her patients lis-ten to music with strongrhythms, \"Their brain wavesbecame more organized, pro-nounced and higher in frequen-cy.\" While not yet conclusive,these results hint at the possibili-ty that rhythms produced bydrums or other musical instru-ments may help maintain brainfunctionality and health. So am I saying that the brain plays the drums? Quite possibly,yes. Further support for this lineof thinking comes from researchon the brain's response to con-centration on visual stimuli.According to Michael Stryker,the rhythms of electrical brainactivity and the sensory neuronsinvolved with vision are verysensitive to our varying atten-tion. It might be assumed thatthe neurons in our visual cortexstart firing in a frenetic waywhen we focus on somethingvisually. However, this mightnot be the case. In a study doneby Pascal Fries and others, itbecame apparent that when weare focused on a stimulus, a sub-set of our neurons begin firing ina coordinated way. In otherwords, it is only when our neu-rons fire in synchronicity that astimulus becomes more promi-nent in our consciousness. Thus,it is not a stretch to suggest thatwhen our brain becomes a morecoordinated drummer, we arebetter able to concentrate andgain awareness. Why the drum works wonders A closer look at the mind-music connection. Counseling T oday IMay 2006 19 The crash of the gong Where does this lead us? As Tomaino's research showed,when we listen to the rhythm ofa drum, it appears that our neu-rons become more organized.And according to Fries, ourbrain focuses and works moreefficiently when our neurons arein harmony and are \"drum-ming\" in a unified pattern. Theelegance of this reflexive rela-tionship is undeniable. To sum-marize, the brain seems to find ahigher state of order when in thepresence of rhythm; when itfinds this higher rhythmic order,we in turn are more focused andattentive. Ultimately, when wedrum with our bodies, ourbrains begin playing along. Theresult is that we become morefocused in both mind and spirit.That's almost magical to me. We've looked at how the drums affect an individualbrain, but as we saw last month,drums also have profound bene-fits for group interactions. Whyare the drums so magical in thisarena? Little if any research hasbeen done here, but as we foundearlier, we focus on things onlywhen our neurons are firing insynchronicity. Perhaps when wedrum in a coordinated gather- ing, we become like a group ofneurons firing together, focus-ing on a specific stimulus. Ingroup therapy, this focus seemsto be a unified spiritual connec-tion. Indeed, we find a beautifulparallel between neuronal activ-ity and group synchronization. So here we are, surrounded by a body of evidence that sup-ports the efficacy of drums inthe therapeutic setting. I playdrums, and I am a counselor-in-training. It seems natural that Iwould choose to incorporatedrums into my own practice.But first I must heed the advicereceived from a number ofcounselors: Know thyself.Specifically, I believe I need tocontinue playing the drumswith an increased focus on myown emotions and the way theyrelate to how and what I amplaying. As Farley suggested,this will assist me in tuning intothe rhythms of my clients. I do not think the drums will be appropriate to use with allmy clients. Some clients arehighly verbal and perhaps donot enjoy music. Others mayhave disabilities that prohibitthem from playing. However, ifa client expresses an interest inmusic and is having trouble connecting with his or her emo-tions, I can think of nothingmore fitting than the introduc-tion of drums to the therapeuticprocess. But I have also reflected on how this topic relates to the big-ger picture \u2014 and what therapyis all about. Drumming be-comes useful as a gateway to theinner self. It can help us toexplore our deep and sometimesguarded emotions in a safe andperhaps unexpected way. Forthat matter, it's even fun, whichis something that is undervaluedin therapy. Drumming can also help us to establish the therapeutic rela-tionship. It can serve as anotherpathway to forging the crucialconnection between client andcounselor that good outcomesare dependent upon. So here we are. We've taken a look at several drumming appli-cations currently being used inthe therapeutic world. We'velooked at the history andprocess of drum therapy. Andwe've looked at some researchthat might help us understandwhy it works. So where doesthis lead us? Ultimately, music therapy isalready a well-established counseling discipline and hasbeen for decades. In fact, theAmerican Music Therapy Asso-ciation is enjoying increasedvisibility, and that trend figuresto continue. Obviously, thisdoes not mean that we all needto become drummers or anyother type of musician for thatmatter. But it does have pro-found implications. Namely, counselors are branching out. We are continu-ally expanding our openness toalternate forms of treatmentwhile distancing ourselves fromthe stereotypical \"lay-down-on-this-couch-and-tell-me-about-your-father\" approach. Thedrum is only one of a virtuallyinfinite variety of tools that wecan use to foster client aware-ness, growth and connection.We could instead have clientsdraw, write a poem or shortstory, make a poster about them-selves, build a model or evenplay a game of basketball withus. Any of these approaches canprovide windows into how ourclients see both themselves andthe world. They could all serveas alternate avenues to bondingwith a client who is desperatelyin need of that connection. As counselors, we need to reflect on who we are as practi-tioners. What are we reallyabout? What moves us? Afterexploring these issues, how dowe incorporate those pieces ofourselves into the therapeuticrelationship? It does not haveto be drums or music or art. Butwe need to bring ourselves totherapy, and we need to findalternate ways to help ourclients be themselves, too. Isn'tthat what counseling is allabout?

David Jepsen is a professor of counsel- ing, rehabilitation and student develop-ment at the University of Iowa. He hasauthored nearly 40 refereed journal arti-cles and 17 book chapters. His line ofinquiry in career development has con-tributed substantially to our understand-ing of basic and advanced career devel-opment principles. He and his colleagueshave produced basic research that has ledto essential applications of these theoriesand models to the career development ofchildren, teenagers and young adults. Theoverarching strand of inquiry he has pur-sued and developed in the career field canbe best viewed as a description of careerdevelopment and career decision-makingacross the life span, both through synthe-sizing what has been learned and in con-ducting new empirical studies. Jepsen'sresults and conclusions have led toimportant applications of career develop-ment theory that have enhanced thedevelopment of a generation of youngand middle-aged adults. His research hasmade its way into many career develop-ment texts and applications.

Blustein, 2006, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 360 pages, $39.95, ISBN: 0-8058-5879-2. This is the kind of publication of which revolutions are made. David Blusteinexplores the changing nature of work atboth the national and global levels. Heboldly addresses the fallout of the rapidlychanging landscape of work, includingthe erosion of job security and the grow-ing isolation and disconnect of workersacross virtually all work settings. Blus-tein speaks to the need for us to recognizethe significance of work as it relates topower and survival as well as its criticalrole in facilitating social connectednessand, ultimately, self-determination. Blustein makes a most compelling moral argument, squaring off against thesocial barriers of racism, sexism, ableismand classism. He demonstrates with pro-found clarity the psychological and, ulti-mately, economic realities of each. Inaddition, he recognizes the role of well-informed public policy in improving theworkplace and thus enhancing access towork, or what he sees as \"the birthright ofeach person.\" Blustein advocates passionately for the inclusion of a variety of perspectives inthe search for a more comprehensiveunderstanding of the experience of workand its meaning in our lives. He gentlyreminds us that a great deal of what we perpetuate and practice as a professionexcludes a significant number of workersat home and abroad who do not experi-ence their work as part of the ratherWestern-centric grand career narrative. Incorporating literature, poetry, song lyrics and other works from several acad-emic disciplines, including those of cur-rent distinguished scholars in vocationalpsychology and counseling, he outlines aframework to strengthen both our studyof work and our day-to-day work withclients. Fusing traditional, empowering,postmodern and emancipatory communi-tarian approaches, he manages to treadlightly on the shoulders of the giants oftraditional theory. From the original work of Parsons to the modern contributions of colleaguessuch as Helms and Savickas, the con-struction of his innovative frameworkbridges past and present toward an opti-mistic future. One notable triumph withregard to practice is Blustein's thoroughdeconstruction and dismantling of theage-old disconnect between mainstreampsychology and counseling and issuesrelated to work. He repeatedly demon-strates via case studies from his own practice just how \"personal\" the experi-ence of working is within the livedhuman experience. His recommendationsfor public policy tackle everything fromeducation reform and the school-to-work transition to the role of diversity and cul-ture in the workplace. If Blustein's efforts are embraced, we may never approach work and work-related issues the same way we have inthe past theoretically, in our research, ourpractice, our communities and, ultimate-ly, in our world. In the spirit of Blustein'simplications for the future, it is my sin-cere hope that this book finds its wayacross academic roles and disciplines andinto the political discourse that informspublic policy. The book would make anexcellent companion text for a career ormulticultural class.

The Road to Tolerance: The Philosophy of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy By Albert Ellis, 2004, Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 275 pages, $21 paperback, ISBN 1-59102-237-1. Albert Ellis' book on tolerance is not what I expected. On the surface, it shouldbe a treatise on the all-too relevant topicof tolerance, but it's actually more thanthat. It's also a thorough (and not at allshort) restatement of the philosophybehind this profoundly effective andheavily outcome-tested method of psy-chotherapy. Its principles are once again convincingly offered as a sound basicphilosophy of life. But the book is about tolerance, too. The press release that accompanied thepromotional copy of the book says:\"REBT promotes an attitude of tolerance,an open-minded willingness to accept thefrailties, less-than-ideal behaviors andunique characteristics of both others andourselves.\" Tolerance, it seems, has beena large part of this philosophy all along. Ellis explains how intolerance toward others can be a destructive force in ourpluralistic society, diverse culture andglobal village, while a lack of self-toler-ance leads to self-disturbing beliefs andbehaviors and, ultimately, unhappiness.Tolerance, he asserts, is a rational, delib-erate choice we can make for ourselvesand for the good of the world. Early sections of The Road to Toler- ance trace the ancient Greek, Roman and Eastern philosophical influences that ledEllis to create the philosophy of REBT,which was a reaction to the stalwart and,by his estimation, largely ineffectivebehavioral and psychodynamic theoriesof the mid-1950s. We even get a clear his-torical explanation of how REBT becamea precursor and contemporary alternativeto the widely used cognitive behaviortherapies of Aaron Beck, DonaldMeichenbaum and others. In latter sections, Ellis unflinchingly discusses the perils of religious fanati-cism, draws comparisons between REBT,Zen Buddhism and the Judeo-ChristianGolden Rule, and even takes a shot atAyn Rand's objectivism and other secularextremist philosophies. This book serves as an excellent oppor- tunity for those new to REBT to discoverits core principles and the powerful sim-plicity of its technique. For current REBTpractitioners, the book is a comfortingreassurance that the prolific master is stillkicking out relevant material in his 90s.And like other Ellis material, this book isdoubly applicable to the lay reader whocraves a less \"disturbable\" life.

We need to define ourunique contribution to the men-tal health field and educate thepublic.

Sam Gladding, immediate past president of ACA and the facili-tator of the phase one meetings,views the \"20/20\" effort as criti-cal to ensuring the profession'sstability and well-being. \"Coun-seling is a relatively young pro-fession \u2014 much younger thanpsychology, social work, psychi-atry, nursing, etc.,\" he said. \"Weneed to be more proactive if weare going to be a core mentalhealth profession. We, as coun-selors, bring many specialties tothe table of wellness with ouremphasis on development andprevention as well as treatment.However, we have not been asgood at advocating for what wedo and our own uniqueness assome other professions. Hope-fully, this effort will help us all tobe more united in a focus and anemphasis and will help us notonly with our identity but with apurposefulness in our energy. ...I think the 20/20 summit is cru-cial to envisioning where we canbe in counseling. If we can seemore clearly where we want tobe in the year 2020, we are muchmore likely to get there as a pro-fession.\" ACA Chief Professional Offi- cer David Kaplan also views the20/20 undertaking as a crucialeffort for counseling's future.\"Our splintering and lack ofunity is hurting the profession,confusing the public and inter- fering with legislative efforts,\"he said. \"There have been peri-odic attempts to do somethinglike (the 20/20 counseling sum-mits) in the past \u2014 Chi SigmaIota led a noteworthy effort anumber of years back \u2014 but Ido think this is historic because,as far as I know, it is the firsttime all of the major players incounseling are coming togetherto hammer out a CORE, That makes 30 counsel-ing organizations working to-gether to plan for the future.\" The evolution of '20/20' Kaplan credited both the AASCB and ACA presidentialteams for their teamwork andthorough planning in getting the20/20 effort off the ground.\"The initial impetus came fromthe AASCB presidential team(Jim Wilson, Charlie Gagnonand J. Barry Mascari),\" he said.\"They realized that multiplevariations in state licensing titlesand regulations were hamperingefforts to develop and imple-ment the AASCB plan. The AASCBpresidential team then ap-proached the ACA presidentialteam and asked if it would makesense to co-sponsor a summit toaddress the lack of unity in thecounseling profession. After aseries of meetings, it was decid-ed to expand the summit toproactively look at all issues thatneed to be addressed to movethe profession forward over thenext 15 years.\"Sam Gladding came up with the creative name of 20/20: AVision for the Future of Coun-seling to signify that we are notonly looking at thorny issuesthat need to be resolved current-ly but also proactively planningfor a clear 20/20 vision of wherewe want the future of profes-sional counseling to be in theyear 2020.\" AASCB Past President Jim Wilson said two circumstancesled its leadership team to con-clude that the counseling profes-sion sorely needed to hold asummit meeting. One wasAASCB's work to formulate alicense portability plan (for arelated story, see page 8). In theprocess, he said, it became \"veryclear that requirements werevery different from state to state.Also, there were different kindsof counselors being licensed. Inessence, as I understand the sit-uation, counselor licensure wasthought to be a unifying eventrather than one which has, on anumber of levels, further frag-mented the profession.\" More red flags were raised by the dissertation of J. Barry Mas-cari, now AASCB's president-elect, which addressed the rela-tionship between counselorlicensing standards and viola-tions. Mascari found that thestandards were so varied that hecouldn't conduct the study hehad planned. \"The results indi-cated that the top three issuesthe counseling profession wasfacing in the future were profes-sional identity, portability and awide variation of licensing were intertwined.\"\"In my study,\" Mascari \"I found that our profession hastoo many individual confer-ences, too many codes of ethicsand we are pulled in directionsthat reduce our power ratherthan create synergy. ... My find-ings suggested that counseloridentity was less clear now thana decade ago. In my review, Ispeculated that the professionspent so much time on achiev-ing licensure that we neverthought about the answer to thequestion, once we were success-ful (with licensure), of 'Nowwhat?' Jim, Charlie Gagnon andI discussed this at our retreat andagreed that the greatest threat toportability was the identity issueand the threats posed by disaffil-iation from ACA. We believedthat our work in licensure waslike a traffic-copter \u2014 we couldsee the larger view, and thefuture was not as positive as welike to delude ourselves intothinking.\" Meeting in Montr\u00e9al At the summit in Montr\u00e9al, AASCB President CharlieGagnon stressed to the delegatesthat \"The idea of keeping theprofession unified is very im-portant. That way, when wewant to accomplish something,it will make it that much easier.\" Gladding also encouraged the delegates to look at the big pic-ture. \"I hope we'll think aboutthe profession of counseling(during this summit) and not justa particular group that we havean allegiance to,\" he said.

However, if we could take some magical leap across thatgulf, the counseling professionwould be on its way to a healthyfuture. The ship is big enough tocarry all of us in the future. Thequestion is whether (individualsin) a profession that prides itselfon diversity can accept eachother by putting aside our small differences for the good of theprofession. The leadership teamsbelieve that failure to move for-ward is not an option because, inthe end, it will be the clients whosuffer. Licensing has led our pro-fession in a wider direction,whereby we brought a new, non-medical, less pathologized ap- proach to mental health.

But much of the discussioncentered around strengtheningcounselor identity and haltingfragmentation of the profession.One delegate voiced the needfor counseling entities tobecome \"issue-driven instead ofturf-driven.\" As the 20/20 summit wound down, Gladding asked the dele-gates about their vision for thecounseling profession in theyear 2020. Among the respons-es, delegates voiced hope thatthe profession would be: IMore unified and synergetic IThe first group prospective clients think of when theyneed IOffering the most cost-effec- tive, nonpathologizing formof treatment ILeading the way for social justice by making qualitycounseling services availableto all people in society IAchieving common ground with portability and licensureacross the states Asked for his impressions of the summit meetings in Phoenixand Montr\u00e9al, Kaplan said, \"Ihave been very impressed. Thedelegates have worked hard todelineate the issues that need tobe addressed to move the pro-fession forward. There has beena clear consensus, with only onedissenting voice, that counselingneeds to view itself as one unit-ed profession with a variety ofspecializations. This wouldbring us into balance with physi-cians, lawyers, nurses and manyother professions.\" Mascari also believes the counseling summits have beenproductive but readily acknowl-edges that much hard work andmany tough decisions lie ahead.\"Several people at the sessionssaid if this summit is going tomove forward and have any pos-itive outcomes, we are all goingto need to be willing to give upsomething,\" he said. \"What thatsomething is remains to be seen....

But neither keynote speaker came to the ACA/CCA Conven-tion solely to pat counselors onthe back. Lewis in particularmade a passionate plea forcounselors to stand up and fillthe void as \"moral anchors\" fora world that oftentimes seemsadrift. Lewis, the former deputyexecutive director of UNICEFand former Canadian ambas-sador to the United Nations,said he was particularly dis-turbed that nations in the West-ern world are spending billionsof dollars to sustain wars butcan't seem to find a \"microscop-ic smidgen of that to sustain thehuman condition.\" A 'call for action' in Africa Much of Lewis' address on April 1 focused on what hetermed the \"almost hallucinato-ry nightmare\" of the HIV/AIDSpandemic in Africa. Based oncurrent projections, he said, by2012, the disease will havekilled or infected approximately100 million people. In his trav-els throughout Africa, Lewisregularly witnesses the devasta-tion wrought by HIV/AIDS.One person told him, \"My coun- try is living with a holocaust.\"Another simply declared, \"Mycountry is on its knees.\" In reviewing the program guide for the ACA/CCA Con-vention, Lewis noted that hesaw one session for counselorsthat discussed feminist theoryand another that focused ongrandparents who are raisingtheir grandchildren. Both topicshave relevance to the currentclimate in Africa, he said. No other communicable dis- ease has ever focused onwomen to the extent thatHIV/AIDS has, Lewis said. Insub-Saharan Africa, he ex-plained, 60 percent of thoseinfected are female. \"The strug-gle to empower the women ofAfrica ... is greateststruggles we \"You can't imagine howfrightened and anxious theselarge numbers of women are.\" Lewis said African mothers regularly ask him, \"What'sgoing to happen to my childrenwhen I die?\" Lewis admitted tothe audience that he doesn'tknow the answer to that heart-wrenching question, but he doesknow that Africa has a tremen-dous need for counselors. \"Counseling has become one of the most crucial componentsof treating this pandemic,\" hesaid. Some African nations arenow requiring that their citizensbe tested for HIV/AIDS, Lewissaid, and this testing requiresboth pre- and post-counseling.\"The best counselors I haveseen in Africa actually accom-pany the woman back home forthe moment of disclosure totheir husband,\" Lewis reported.As can be imagined, the atmos-phere surrounding these en-counters is often intense. Coun-selor mediation between thepartners \"is becoming increas-ingly important,\" he said. Orphans are another group in desperate need of counseling,Lewis said. No one anticipatedthe number of children thatwould be left behind by theonslaught of HIV/AIDS inAfrica, he said, and \"the delugehas become almost irre-versible torrent.\" Millions ofAfrican children have been leftto crave not only nurturance andlove, Lewis said, but simply atactile connection with an adult.When he travels in Africa, chil-dren regularly grab on to him,Lewis said, clinging to theslightest opportunity for physi-cal contact. Children as young as 8 are now heading siblinghouseholds, he said, while manyothers are reduced to wanderingthe landscape, overwhelmed bytheir circumstances. \"These kidsare desperate for some type ofthoughtful, sensitive, therapeu-tic response,\" Lewis said. The communities are too poor and the numbers too staggeringto absorb all the orphans, Lewisreported. In many cases, younggirls are persuaded to have sexfor pennies, while young boysare convinced to enter into egre-gious child labor because theybelieve it offers them their onlyhope of survival. Under these most trying of conditions, Lewis said, grand-parents \u2014 in particular, grand-mothers \u2014 have emerged asAfrica's unsung heroes. At anage when \"they should belooked after by their own chil-dren,\" he said, \"instead they arestarting to parent again.\" And intrying desperately to meet thechildren's needs, these grand-mothers have their own need,Lewis said. They often report tohim that they desire counselingeven more so than medicine ormoney, he said. While the efforts to find avaccine or develop drugs to treat HIV/AIDS are intense,Lewis said, what are not ade-quately taken into account arethe African societies raw withloss. That's why he told theassembled counselors that they\"have an extremely importantcontribution to make\" to theongoing battle against HIV/AIDS. Lewis said he couldenvision a \"Counselors WithoutBorders\" type of program andcharged those in attendancewith fashioning some type ofsolidarity with Africa and thedeveloping world. \"The opportunity, the possi- bility of the counselors of theworld united ... in decencythat pounds in your hearts,\"Lewis said, \"you can't imaginethe difference you could make.\" CCA President David Pater- son told convention attendeesthat Lewis' address should be\"taken as a call for action.\" When life skips a beat When ACA President Patricia Arredondo started thinkingabout possible speakers for theconvention, Tipper Gore was atthe top of her list. \"She is a tire-less advocate in eradicating thestigma of mental illness,\" Counseling T oday IMay 2006 29 Arredondo said. \"She is some- one who is so humble aboutwhat she does yet has madesuch an impact on our society.\" Indeed, Gore's career has been the embodiment of ac-tivism, including founding suchgroups as the CongressionalWives Task Force, the Parents'Music Resource Center andFamilies for the Homeless. Butin addressing ACA/CCA Con-vention attendees on April 2,Gore said she didn't originallyset out to blaze a trail as anadvocate and activist. An avidphotographer, she shared notonly her personal story with theaudience but also family photosthat marked her life's journey. Married at age 21, Gore envi- sioned herself becoming a fami-ly counselor and thought herhusband would become a writer.She went on to earn her bache-lor's degree in psychology fromBoston University and then hermaster's degree in psychologyfrom George Peabody Collegeat Vanderbilt University. Herinterest in family and mentalhealth issues was born in partfrom personal experience. Herparents divorced when she was4, and her mother struggled withclinical depression. \"At thetime,\" Gore said, \"mental ill- ness was something that wasn'tdiscussed\" outside of the home. Her plans to become a coun- selor changed, however, when\"life skipped a beat\" \u2014 a themerepeated throughout Gore's lifeand incorporated into herkeynote speech. In this instance,the change in life's rhythmcame about because of AlGore's decision to end pursuit ofa writing career and to insteadenter politics. Soon after he waselected to Congress, TipperGore established the Congres-sional Wives Task Force, whichfocused in part on the effect thatTV violence had on children. Gore's own children inspired her to take on the challenge ofadvocating for the homeless.One day, as she and her childrenwere out walking, they saw ahomeless woman. Curious, thechildren asked Gore why thewoman was talking to herself,and she explained that thewoman probably had a mentalillness. The children next askeda question that spoke to Gore'sconcern for the human condi-tion: \"Who's going to take careof her, Mom?\" Gore went on to co-found and chair an organization to help thehomeless, focusing especially on those who are mentally ill,and to raise public awareness ofhomeless issues. Gore herselfoften spent time talking withthe homeless population in La-fayette Park, across from theWhite House, and helping themto attain services. Having askedone woman what she could doto help, Gore vividly remem-bers her response: \"You canhelp me get my reality back.\"Today, Gore reported to theaudience, that same woman isliving independently and work-ing full time. During her time in Washing- ton, Gore made personal con-nections with many of the city'shomeless. \"This isn't what Idreamed of when I said I want-ed to be a professional coun-selor,\" Gore confessed to theaudience. Nevertheless, shesaid, building those relation-ships and playing some part inhelping others improve theirlives has proved to be both asatisfying and transformativeexperience. Despite Gore's personal belief in the importance of mentalhealth services, it took a neartragedy close to home and atragedy that shocked the entirenation a decade later before she embraced her role as an outspo-ken advocate and revealed herown story. In 1989, the Gores'son, Albert III, was struck by acar and almost killed. Followingthat accident, Tipper Gore said,she realized she was sufferingfrom clinical depression, whichwas successfully treated withthe help of professional therapyand medication. However, Gorewas too worried about the stig-ma attached to mental illness toreveal her struggle publicly. But an experience shortly after the nation's most infamousschool shooting convinced Gorethat she needed to speak out. Inthe aftermath of Columbine, shemet with students and teachersto talk about the issue of suicide.When asked if they or someonethey knew had ever consideredsuicide, a majority of the stu-dents in the room raised theirhands, to the dismay of all theadults present. When asked whythey were hiding their feelingsinstead of reaching out for help,many students responded,\"We're afraid. We don't want tobe labeled.\" Gore quickly real-ized that she was doing the samething. Unless she and others inthe public eye found thecourage to step forward, she decided, yet another generationwould suffer in silence becauseof the stigma of mental illness. From that point forward, she publicly acknowledged her ownstruggle with depression andbecame one of the nation's mostvisible advocates for mentalhealth care services. In addition,she served as chair of the firstWhite House Conference onMental Health. In preparing her talk for the ACA/CCA Convention and inreviewing the pictures she hadchosen for her presentation,Gore said she was reminded ofopportunities \u2014 both those shehad seized and those she hadmissed. When life skips a beat,she told the assembled coun-selors, it is wiser to embrace thechange instead of mourning thebest laid plans. \"It's the jour-ney,\" she said. \"The journey isthe reward. Make the most ofthe unexpected twists that havecome your way.\" I Jonathan Rollins is the editor-in-chief of Counseling Today .

I Counseling T oday IMay 2006 31 Counseling T oday IMay 2006 32 Division, Region & Branch News AGLBIC holds official same-sex wedding ceremony at convention Submitted by John Marszalek john.marszalek@gmail.com To enhance awareness within the counseling profession of therights and benefits denied tosame-sex couples in the UnitedStates, the Association for Gay,Lesbian and Bisexual Issues inCounseling hosted an officialsame-sex wedding event inMontr\u00e9al on 1 for coun-selors attending the AmericanCounseling Association/Cana-dian Counselling AssociationConvention. Four male couples and four female couples were marriedaccording to the laws of theCanadian province of Qu\u00e9becin a civil ceremony officiatedby Brenda Langlois. The cere-mony included opening wordsfrom ACA President PatriciaArredondo, a recitation ofvows, a unity candle ceremony,exchange of rings and the offi-cial signature of the registry.The couples came to Montr\u00e9alfrom as far away as Utah andhave waited to get officiallymarried as long as 23 years.Attending the ceremony werean estimated 300 family mem-bers, friends, ACA members,the current president of ACAand five past presidents, theACA president-elect and ACAdivisional leaders who wantedto show their support for thecouples and for the legal recog-nition of same-sex marriage.Following the ceremony, thecouples were honored at a wed-ding reception with champagneand a four-tiered wedding cake. Newly married AGLBIC President Joy Whitman said,\"Our purpose in sponsoring apublic wedding for same-sexcouples at this conference is tohighlight the inequity same-sexcouples experience and to raiseawareness of this inequity forcounseling professionals. Cur-rently in the United States,same-sex couples are spendingtheir lives together with loveand commitment, but they areunable to access the more than1,138 automatic federal andadditional state protectionsafforded to legally married cou-ples. One of our goals was toidentify conditions that createbarriers to the human growthand development of lesbian,gay, bisexual and transgenderclients and communities. Allcounseling professionals arecharged with the goal to advo- cate for clients and to changeoppressive systems \u2014 systemsthat serve as barriers to mentalhealth. I see this event as join-ing our mission with that ofACA and, in doing so, high-lighting that same-sex couplescontinue to face discriminationwhen it comes to the option tomarry in the United States. It isour hope that all counselingprofessionals, LGBT and het-erosexual, will join together tofight for this right and thereforeimprove the mental health ofLGBT clients.\" ACA, the Association for Counselor Education and Su-pervision and the AmericanRehabilitation Counseling As-sociation sponsored the cere-mony. In addition, the ceremo-ny was supported by Coun-selors for Social Justice and theInternational Association ofAddictions and Offender Coun-selors, all divisions of ACA.The organizations sponsoredand supported the event todemonstrate support for les-bian, gay and bisexual individ-uals and to bring to the fore-front ACA's commitment tosocial justice.

EB-ACA institute features creative group techniques Submitted by Christine Sloan Christine.sloan@cmtymail.6asg. army.mil The European Branch of the American Counseling Associa-tion held a 15-hour weekendLearning Institute on Feb. 25-26 in Germany, titled\"Creative Techniques.\"EB-ACA was fortunate to haveLaura Veach and Donna Hen-derson from Wake Forest Uni-versity in North Carolina aspresenters. Both brought exten-sive backgrounds in the field ofgroup counseling. The trainingfocused on two separate popu-lations: children and clients dealing with addictions. Veach spoke at length about the nature of addictions andexplained the biopsychosocialissues that clients must face.Group therapy was presentedas a wonderful and useful toolwhen working with addiction.The counselor's role is to helpclients understand their person-al truths of addiction and tohelp them with their goals ofrecovery. By showing clientstheir reflection, for example,they begin to replace denialwith their personal truth.Demonstrated group exercisesincluded using art expression,rewording song lyrics that nor-mally would cue the addictionand creating group fairy tales. Veach explained that many addicts who have issues withviolence and/or sexual abuseactually misread social cues.By working in a group setting,clients build social skills andlearn appropriate social cues.This helps them to interact withthe world and to create a substi-tute for substance use. Using creativity in the group sessions through experientialactivities must be done withcare. When creating new tech-niques or using researched tech-niques, Veach strongly suggest-ed being supervised, both clini-cally and by peers, throughobservation and taping. Henderson presented creativ- ity as it relates to children ingroups. Counselors must lookat their own expectations ofwhat children can do. If coun-selors don't believe in theclients, the clients won'tbelieve in themselves. Coun-selors need to be authentic andconsistent and should respectthe children without being in aparental role. Henderson explained that when working with children,the counselor should providemore structure and parametersin the group. Once trust isestablished within the group,the creative use of the imagina-tion \u2014 using literature, art, dra-matic play or music \u2014 can bevery effective. The point is thatchildren can be in control ofwhat they think about. Hender-son warned against the use ofvisual exercises when workingwith young clients dealing withpost-traumatic stress disorder. Creativity involves giving a voice to clients who needanother tool for self-expres-sion. This process can providevisual cues to the internal expe- rience and create opportunitiesfor self-examination and expe-riential learning. Perspectivescan change, and defenses maybe lowered. Tools such asbooks, music and even Play-Doh can be used in children'sgroup settings. Art can be usedas a group project to teachsocial skills or as an individualproject to help with self-expression. By having thesecreative tools in their \"counsel-ing bag,\" counselors will havemore ways of reaching thoseclients who were considered tobe lost.

TheSpecter/Harkin amendment passed by anoverwhelming 73-27 vote. The American Counseling Association thanks those counselors who respondedto our alerts; we would not have achievedthis win without your phone calls, e-mailsand faxes to your senators. Specter andHarkin deserve much credit for leading abipartisan charge to support education,health and workforce programs. If yoursenators voted in favor of the Specter/Harkin amendment, please take amoment to send them a quick thank youmessage. In contrast, the FY 2007 budget approved by the House Budget Commit-tee would cut federal spending on educa-tion by more than $5 billion. Rep. MikeCastle (R-Del.) is poised to offer anamendment on the House floor toincrease spending on education andhealth programs similar to that offered onthe Senate side by Specter and Harkin. Castle and roughly two-dozen other mod-erate Republicans have stated that theywill not vote for the budget bill unless itcontains the additional $7 billion includ-ed in his amendment. Loan forgiveness for counselors takes first step to becoming law The House approved legislation (H.R. 609) on March 30 to renew the HigherEducation Act for the next six years.Although large portions of the HigherEducation Act were reauthorized earlierthis year, H.R. 609 mostly covers theremainder of HEA programs, includingPell grants and campus-based aid such aswork-study. As part of H.R. 609, the House approved an amendment sponsored byReps. Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.) andIleana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) to addcounselors and other child mental healthprofessionals to a list of individuals eligi-ble for limited federal student loan for-Washington Update Continued from page 1 giveness. The Kennedy/Ros-Lehtinen amendment defines \"child and adolescentmental health professional\" mean anindividual \"employed as a psychiatrist,psychologist, school psychologist, psy-chiatric nurse, social worker, schoolsocial worker, marriage and family thera-pist, school counselor or professionalcounselor.\" H.R. 609 also makes librari-ans, early childhood educators and for-eign language specialists, among others,eligible for loan forgiveness. Counselors cannot receive loan repay- ment as a result of the House vote. TheHouse-passed language first must beapproved by the Senate, signed into lawby the president, outlined under regula-tions developed by the U.S. Departmentof Education and funded by Congressbefore any money can be disbursed. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee has approvedthe Senate version of the Higher Educa-tion Act (S. 1614), but it has not been con-sidered on the Senate floor. S. 1614 doesnot include the loan forgiveness languagefor counselors. ACA members are asked to contact their senators to request co-sponsorshipof the Child Healthcare Crisis Relief Act(S. 537), a Senate bill similar to theKennedy/Ros-Lehtinen amendment pro-visions. For more information, contactChris Campbell with ACA's Office ofPublic Policy and Legislation at ccampbell@counseling.org . Dangerous health insurance bill moving forward in the Senate The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee has approvedlegislation \u2014 S. 1955, the Health Insur-ance Marketplace Modernization &Affordability Act \u2014 that would under-mine comprehensive health insurancecoverage for millions of Americans.Although proponents claim the bill willincrease health insurance coverageamong small businesses, it would do soby expanding the use of bare-bones poli-cies and weakening existing coverage. ACA is joining a wide array of health organizations in opposing S. 1955because it pre-empts important, funda-mental state benefit and provider laws.Currently, 22 states require health plans tocover the services of licensed profession-al counselors or to offer such coverage,and 39 states have adopted mental healthinsurance requirements. HIMMA wouldoverride all these laws and wouldincrease insurance rates for higher-riskemployee groups. Counselors are encouraged to call their senators and ask them to reject S. 1955.For more information on this issue, con-tact Scott Barstow with ACA atsbarstow@counseling.org or by calling 800.347.6647 ext. 234. I Counseling T oday IMay 2006 35 together as an extended family. In some ways, I liken our gatheringto a family reunion, with familymembers in attendance from allparts of the world. Indeed, wehad participants from Guatemala,China, England and Brazil, justto mention a few places. Therewere more than 50 counselorsfrom Puerto Rico in attendance.Viva Puerto Rico! In a nation as vast as Canada, counselors fromVancouver and Calgary had totravel clear across the country toattend. Perhaps it was the coziness of the hotel lobbies or the smaller,older stone churches and muse-ums in the immediate environsthat enhanced the sense of multi-culturalism. Everything seemedvery familial. In Spanish, we talkabout the values of familismo and personalismo , referring to the importance of familylike and per-sonal relationships. Our ACA/CCA Convention truly possessedthat feel. Celebrating our accomplishments One of my goals as president was to initiate an ACA GraduateStudent Association. We are onour way and celebrated at theconvention with the inauguralGraduate Student Summit (seepage 10). ACA past presidentsand other association leaders lenttheir support by participating indiscussions about networking andmentoring. We all view graduatestudents as the future of ACA. I also greeted participants at the First-Timers Luncheon, whichwas hosted by ACA President-Elect Marie Wakefield. From per-sonal conversations, I learned thatmany first-timers plan to be inDetroit for the next ACA Conven-tion in 2007. We also celebrated the silver anniversary of CACREP and the20th birthday of the Associationfor Adult Development andAging. National awards werehanded out, and 10 memberswere named Fellows of ACA (seepage 20). Felicidades! Strengthening ACA This year, for the first time, I invited all the ACA task forcesappointed for the year to prepare aposter session. Members, studentsand professionals alike workedacross the country via listservsand teleconferences to prepareexemplary poster sessions full ofuseful information for all ACAmembers and professional coun-selors. We all benefit from theirdedication to their respectivetasks. I hope that the involvement of members in task forces such asthose dedicated to identifyingbest practices for working with immigrant families, promotingmulticultural and advocacycompetencies, and enhancingmental health practices in theschools will continue. Check theACA website ( www.counseling. org) in the next month or so to access all the resources preparedby the task forces, the Researchand Knowledge Committee and others. Taking time to honor cultural differences Our annual convention is an opportunity to celebrate ourfriends, colleagues and rolemodels, to both reconnect andmake new connections. I knowthat the students from the Uni- versidad del Valle in Guatemalawill become spokespersons forACA when they return. I trustthat the new Graduate StudentAssociation will strengthen allsegments of ACA \u2014 divisions,regions and branches. And Ibelieve that many ACA memberswill make a return visit to Mon-tr\u00e9al to savor the cultural rich- ness of this beautiful city. One of my tenets is that multi- cultural awareness is a lifelongjourney. I am fortunate to haveplayed a part in making historywith ACA's first internationalconvention. I know that my mul-ticultural journey was enrichedin the process. Adelante! IPresident Continued from page 5Counseling T oday IMay 2006 36Career counselors will more and more often find clients inter-ested in e-working \u2014 that is,full-time, home-based telecom-muters who have little face-to-face interaction with a mainoffice location and staff. In 2001,one out of five workers in theUnited States did some form oftelework, and one projection esti-mates that the nation will have 20million telecommuters by 2010. Working from home can seem attractive to many career clientsfor a variety of reasons: the flex-ibility of scheduling their tasks,the lack of a commute and a per-ceived opportunity to balancework and family life. Further-more, both employers and em-ployees benefit from telecom-muting's amenability to workerswith physical disabilities. In the March 2006 Journal of Employment Counseling (pages 39-46), James Kirk and RobertBelovics outline important con-siderations that counselorsshould be ready to discuss withpotential telecommuters. Theauthors point out several poten-tial drawbacks to e-work, partic-ularly social isolation, lack ofclarity in job expectations, man-agers' poor attitudes toward tele-workers and misunderstandingsabout promotional structure.Work overload, in which a home-based employee tries to performboth full-time home and workduties, is another real danger. Kirk and Belovics list five questions about e-working thatemployment counselors caninvestigate with clients. Theyalso provide website addressesfor 12 high-quality online re-sources about e-working. An innovative approach to therapist development In the counseling psychology program at Curtin University inPerth, Australia, a course basedon research in process, outcomeand therapist skill-building com-pletes the second year of train-ing. The course includes practicein the stressful situations pre-sented by clients who are hostile,angry, withdrawn, sullen, per-sonality disordered and trauma-tized \u2014 in other words, unlikethe usual practice client, who ispurposely selected to be less dis-turbed than most. Helping clients make decisions about telework The course design takes into account two predictors of goodoutcome: the strong therapeuticalliance and a counselor's abil-ity to manage strong emotionalreactions to clients. It is basedon research in training thatshows a consistent link be-tween theory and practice isnecessary and that live, experi-ential methodologies with ex-pert feedback are the best learn-ing settings. The course useslive actors to present complexcases, and trainees take turnscounseling the client and dis-cussing their reactions. Thethree focuses are alliance build-ing and repair, case conceptual-ization, and understanding andworking with transference andcountertransference. The course is described in Jan Grant's \"Training Counselors toWork With Complex Clients:Enhancing Emotional Respon- siveness Through ExperientialMethods\" in the March 2006issue of Counselor Education and Supervision (pages 218- 230). This innovative approachto therapist development willinterest builders of counselortraining curricula. Treating depression in older clients The number of people in the United States who are olderthan age 65 has more thantripled in the last 100 years, andthat figure continues to grow.Older adults are expected toconstitute a larger proportion ofcounseling clientele who oftensuffer from depression and dys-thymia (persistent low mood).Carlos Zalaquett and AndreaStens review the research litera-ture on nonmedical treatmentsfor depression and dysthymic disorder in older adults in theSpring 2006 Journal of Coun- seling & Development (pages 192-201). Four individual therapies were supported in empiricalstudies. Cognitive-behavioraltherapy changes depressingthoughts and negative interpre-tations of events, thus increas-ing pleasant experiences. Inter-personal therapy focuses onimproving social relationships,which also make life moreworth living. Brief dynamictherapy explores the olderadult's lifetime development,leading to insight about uncon-scious processes and to correc-tive emotional experiences.Reminiscence therapy alsoexplores the client's life time-line, reflecting on the past andderiving a meaningful interpre-tation of struggles and success- es through sharing memorabiliaand stories. The authors also mention family and group counseling aspromising treatments for olderadults, though not as fullyresearched Zalaquett informs counselorsabout research-supported prac-tices and the distinguishing fea-tures of the proven treatments.

WALSH AND NORMAN C. DASENBROOK Q:What is the best method for deter- mining what to charge for counseling inprivate practice? A:Putting a monetary value on what we do in the counseling profession canbe difficult. After all, we are caring pro-fessionals who want to help first andworry about money second. But if youwant to survive and even thrive in pri-vate practice, you will need to put a priceon your work. We like to ask the question, \"If you had a product that could heal old psychologi-cal wounds; help parents and childrencommunicate better; keep a family frombreaking up; help someone who isdepressed feel that suicide is not theironly alternative; diagnose anxiety, be very valuable?\" That productis you. We are some of the most well-trained, experienced, dedicated therapistsin the mental health field, and there isnothing wrong with being compensatedas such. Have you been to a doctor, dentist or other medical professional lately? Haveyou had your car repaired or neededplumbing done in your home recently? Ithink you see where we are headed here.These service professionals charge feescommensurate with their training, abilityand the laws of supply and demand.Counselors can too. Fees for counseling vary from commu- nity to community. Depending on thearea, fees can range from $60 to $150 persession or more. There is a concept called\"community standard\" that affects notonly fees but also standards of practice.Simply stated, this means you can askwhat other counselors, social workers orpsychologists in your area charge. Thiswill give you a range to work from so thatyour fees aren't too high or too low foryour area. Positioning your fees somewhere in the upper 50 percent would be a logical start-ing point. Resist the temptation to \"lowball.\" Setting fees below the communitystandard will not get you more clients.While fees are one consideration forprospective clients, most are more con-cerned about your competency and repu- tation than what you charge. Q:American Counseling Association members would like to have a \"one-stop\"place to access managed care links,billing information, website resources,National Provider Index registration andHIPP A compliance information. Cansuch a resource be developed? A:Currently you can find direct links to some managed care companies by goingto ACA's website at www.counseling.org , clicking on \"Private Practice Pointers.\" Under\"Provider Relations Contact List forManaged Care and Insurance Panels\" youwill find a few ready links where you canlearn more about the company and evenapply to be a provider. This month we will be updating our whole list of insurance and managed carecompanies, including providing clickablelinks to their websites so ACA memberscan apply for providership by having aone-stop place to do so. We are also plan-ning to make links for National ProviderIndex applications as well as billing andwebsite resources. Q:I am doing some private practice, and the practice I am with puts clients'names on the bank deposit slip each daybeside the amount showing their pay-ments for services and then takes it to thebank. Is it normal procedure to showclients' names in this regard? A:We never put the names of clients on our deposit tickets. There is no need todo that if your office or your accountingsoftware tracks payments. To meetHIPAA guidelines and ensure confiden-tiality, we recommend you delete clientinformation everywhere it is not essen-tial. Clients should not be able to look atthe appointment book. Also, try to have10 minutes between clients (a \"50-minute\" hour) if possible and discussconfidentiality with receptionists andyour answering service. The law says that clinicians are in com- pliance as long as they make reasonableefforts to comply. With this all written inthe informed consent document, the ther-apist should be within compliance guide-lines. The wording in our informed con- sent document (available on ACA's web-site under Private Practice Pointers/Informed Consent) states that the thera-pist makes every practical effort to pro-tect the confidentiality of the client. Thatsame website has a bulletin on HIPAAcompliance as well. Q:I attended your private practice workshop at the ACA/CCA Convention. Iam following up to get informationregarding contacts for the national billingservices. Thanks for an awesome work-shop filled with practical information. A:Good to hear from you.

Counseling T oday IMay 2006 39Student Focus - BY EMILY WISNIEWSKI \"Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listen-ing ear, an honest compliment or thesmallest act of caring, all of which havethe potential to turn a life around.\" \u2014 Leo Buscaglia I am so excited about starting a mas- ter's degree program to become a schoolcounselor. It's my answer to the ques-tion, \"What do you want to be when yougrow up?\" Thinking about myself in a profession in which I will be surrounded by peopleand faced with challenges that make eachday different and exciting is an amazingvision to have. School counseling doesexactly that. I can't wait to begin classesand learn ways to help students under-stand and deal with social, behavioral andpersonal problems that are barriers to aca-demic and life success. I anticipate that thenext two years of studying, researchingand working with a team of peers who arealso striving to become future counselorswill be two of the best years of my life.My passion for school counseling has existed for some time, but it wasn't a mat-ter of waking up one morning with adream. What has grown into a desire tobecome a professional school counselorstarted in middle school. Being helped My peers and I grew up in an environ- ment where education was the main con-cern and getting to the top was the chiefgoal. I learned as a child that the path tosuccess started with education, so engag-ing in my studies, setting high academicgoals and working diligently to achievethem was always a top priority. Thencame adolescence, and things changed.It took a great deal of learning to over-come the many obstacles that wereplaced in front of me during that timeperiod. I imagined that middle school would be stressful and demanding because ofthe unfamiliar routines and rigorousworkload. What I didn't expect was howdifficult it would be to maintain relation-A passion for school counseling ships with my old friends from elemen- tary school while also trying to branchout and create new friendships. Argu-ments between friends became all-con-suming, distracting me from everythingelse in life, including my studies, mygoals and even my position as captain ofthe swim team. These social stresses went far beyond my parents' abilities to help, so they sug-gested that I see the school counselor. Iwas hesitant to make this bold move,believing that seeing a counselor denotedmy inability to cope with everyday strug-gles. But Ms. Kropas' heartening smilemade the decision so much easier. Iremain thankful to this day that I found thecourage to let her into my life. Coming to her office week after week, I couldn't have felt any more comfortablethanks to Ms. Kropas' cheerful manner.The regular sessions of talking (and oftencrying) created a sense of relief because Iwas able to articulate so many repressedfeelings. I explained to her the struggles ofkeeping old friends, making new ones,receiving my first set of disappointing grades and all my other new concerns.Ms. Kropas listened, helped me see thestrengths I already possessed and taughtme ways to deal with the difficult changesconfronting me. The sense of comfort I felt sitting across from Ms. Kropas enabled me tospeak up openly without fear of beinglaughed at, criticized or demeaned. Theseweekly meetings revealed my personalstrengths and made me realize how muchmore able I was becoming in dealingwith life. A new sense of independence emerged in high school, and with it came maturity,self-confidence and the opportunity tohelp others. Roles began to reverse so thatI was the one talking to friends, listeningto their problems and lending support. Thefeeling of being needed and, even more,the reward of helping was wonderful. Thisled to my first real recognition of what Iwanted to do with my life. Continued on page 45 Counseling T oday IMay 2006 40 BY PAUL NELSON Ten to 15 percent of all reported claims cases handledby the insurance companies inthe American Counseling Asso-ciation-sponsored professionalliability insurance programrelate to suicide or attemptedsuicide. The costs associatedwith these claims amount toclose to 40 percent of overallexpenditures. In essence, thatmeans that premium chargeswould be much lower were itnot for this risk. In the aftermath of the Sep- tember 11, 2001, terrorist at-tacks, the suicide rate amongthose serving as rescue workersin the United States increased.More than three years into themilitary conflict in Iraq, the sui-cide rate among U.S. veterans isalso growing rapidly. Suiciderates are also climbing amongour youth and America's agingpopulation. The Suicide and Cri-sis Center reports that 2,000 sui- cides are attempted each day inthe United States. Of that num-ber, 85 people a day succeed intheir attempt, meaning that31,000 people die each year inthe United States due to suicide. In a case reported to the ACA Insurance Trust, the counselorwas called to a hospital to see aperson who had attempted sui-cide. The client had experi-enced a demotion at work, andhis fianc\u00e9e had broken off theirengagement only weeks beforetheir scheduled wedding. Thepatient was released from thehospital and shortly afterwarddid, in fact, commit suicide.The lawsuit named the psychia-trist, the hospital and the coun-selor for allegedly failing toestablish appropriate care toprevent his death. Mental health professionals can take some comfort inknowing that they can helppeople who are contemplatingsuicide. Regrettably, there will also be a greater need for coun-selors to help those grieving theloss of someone who has com-mitted suicide. Counselors are at legal risk for the suicide of their clients. Ifsomeone you counsel shows astrong desire to end his or herlife, then you have a legal oblig-ation to intervene. Applicablelaws usually indicate that theoutcome is judged by the degreeof risk assumed by the clientand the practitioner's ability toassess that danger. The family of a suicide victim may feel some aggression to-ward the deceased, asking howtheir loved one could have donethat. The family may also bedespondent, perhaps believingthey could have done more toprevent the loss. Those feelingsof aggression and guilt often gettransferred to the professionalwho was working with the per-son prior to the suicide.The costs to compensate a family who successfully estab-lishes negligence by the coun-selor can be enormous. In onecase reported to the ACA Insur-ance Trust, the family of a sui-cide victim established loss ofearnings from the decedent in anamount in excess of $1 million.There were also claims for lossof affection, along with legaldefense fees, funeral expensesand the like. The ACA Code of Ethics offers guidance concerning theissue of suicide assessment andintervention. Standard C.2.a.,\"Boundaries of re-sources when requested orneeded.\" To anticipate potential legal difficulty, it is important to con-sider your limits and then to consult and refer. Even if youknow you're doing everythingright, it is still a good idea toconsider consultation and refer-ral resources. Even if a client suicide oc- curs, it is unlikely you will befound guilty of negligence in acourt of law if you have actedappropriately within the profes-sional practice standards, in-creased the professional inter-vention and appropriately con-sulted and referred.

After many weeks ofwork, his report card arrivedwith all passing grades. I hadnever felt so much joy and satis-faction. The change I helpedtake root in Darrell's life mademe realize what a world of dif-ference a school counselor couldmake. What a gift for me! The high school internship gave me the opportunity to workclosely with the principal, staffand counselors and enabled meto see the full range of the pro-fessional school counselingfield. The school included nu-merous teenagers who requiredservices to meet many develop-mental, preventive and remedialneeds. The students varied inage, gender, race, ethnicity, reli-gion, sexual orientation, physi-cal and mental abilities, andsocioeconomic status. Theschool was an exceptional placefor me to witness the manystrengths and needs of people inenvironments I had never beforeexperienced. All my motivationsfor becoming a professional school counselor were rein-forced. The challenges and com-plexities faced by each studentwere fascinating, while the per-sonal rewards for being involvedwith the students' developmentwere tremendous. So much to learn I learned far more in that school than how to help, howev-er. So many things need to beevaluated around politics,threats, emergencies and more.Then there is adherence to ethi-cal standards while also abidingby the specific laws, policies andprocedures that govern a school.It was a privilege for me toobserve the wide range of inci-dents that occurred and how dif-ferent professionals throughoutthe school handled those situa-tions. It also became clear justhow important it is to listendeeply to the experiences andperspectives of everyone in-volved. Not only do people inthe school need such attentionbut also those in the entire com-munity. The importance ofbuilding trust and garnering sup-port for a school that values andembraces diversity requires thateveryone be heard and feel a sense of investment. Today's youth are living in exciting times that include anincreasingly diverse society,new technologies and expandingopportunities. Every studentneeds support and guidance toensure that they are properlyprepared to become the nextgeneration of parents, workers,leaders and citizens. I want to bethat professional who helps cre-ate the right atmosphere forlearning through a comprehen-sive developmental school coun-seling program. In such a pro-gram, counselors work along-side school staff, parents and stu-dents to create the caring, sup-portive atmosphere that is neces-sary for youth to learn and growto their full potential. My passion for working in the counseling field has grown witheach new experience. I was for-tunate enough to receive aninternship at American Counsel-ing Association headquartersthat has enabled me to learnabout the background issues thatoccur in the field. I even had theopportunity to represent myhome state of New York throughlobbying efforts, advocating forthe importance of professional school counselors and the effec-tiveness of grants and fundingfor school counseling programs.Working at ACA has againexpanded my vision for counsel-ing and my commitment tobeing a strong advocate for thiswonderful profession. I will always remember Ms. Kropas and the deep impact shehad on my life. I will never for-get the power of her cheerfulsmile and listening ear. I want tohave the same type of impact onmy future students and helpthem to turn their lives around.Professional school counselorsare needed more than ever, and Ihope that many of you readingthis will discover the sameenthusiasm for the field that hasbecome such an important partof my life. I Counseling T oday IMay 2006 45Helping others I started college thinking that psychology would be my path-way to helping others, but anexperience before my junior yearrefocused my efforts. That sum-mer, I worked at a camp where Ispent endless hours talking togirls who were preparing to enterhigh school. I spent many nightsrubbing backs as these girls criedand talked about how theirfriends had left them out at din-ner or how a best friend was flirt-ing with the guy they liked. I wasreminded of how hard it was tobe that age. Knowing I had beenthe backbone of these girls' livesduring a confusing time was themost rewarding experience ofmy life to that point. That's whenthe realization hit me that being aschool counselor could be won-derfully fulfilling life's work. School counseling is where my passion for helping seemsperfectly suited. The importanceof assisting in and supporting theemotional growth of studentstends to get overlooked becauseof the academic pressure onschools, but its connection toacademic achievement is begin-ning to garner more attention.My own academic success un-doubtedly relates back to thesupport and guidance I receivedfrom Ms. Kropas. The summer camp experience moved me away from the fieldof psychology and toward thecounseling discipline. Courseson issues related to the experi-ence of bisexual, gay, lesbianand transgendered persons, aswell as concerns with HIV andAIDS, added to my motivationand determination to understandand help others. An internshipworking with HIV/AIDS-infect-ed clients proved emotionallydifficult, but it felt enormouslyrewarding to help clients smile,laugh or develop a sense of hope. A very different internship then took me to a high school totalk with students about a varietyof issues, from failing test gradesto drugs to pregnancy. So manystudents came my way, but onetroubled boy made a specialimpact. Darrell was 16 and hadjust gotten out of jail. It wasobvious he would be a real chal-lenge, so I was very apprehen-sive about working with him.Day in and day out he wouldarrive and explain the discour-agement he felt from manyteachers. He thought no one hadfaith in him, and he was afraid ofeventually dropping out ofschool.

Enactment of this provision would establish an important source of support for counselors and o ther professionals serving this population. To help support loan forgiveness, counselors are encouraged to contact their senators to ask them to co-sponsor a related bill: S. 537, the Child Healthcare Crisis Relief Act.

This bipartisan legislation would provide loan repayment assistance for school counselors, mental health counselors, psychia-trists, psychologists and related professionals serving children and youth. The Center for Mental Health Servicesestimates that 20 percent of U.S. children and adolescents have a diagnosable mental health disorder and thatabout two-thirds of these children and adolescents do not receive mental health care. We desperately need morequalified professionals working to serve this population. The House of Representatives has already passed leg-islation similar to S. 537. \"I look forward to hearing the senator's position on this important issue.\"ACA Resource Chris http://capwiz.com/counselingThe Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee has approved S. 1955 (the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act). HIMMA is dan- gerous legislation that would severely erode the ability of states to protect health care consumers from steep health insurance price increases, to establish minimum benefit stan- dards and to regulate the provision of health insurance. S. 1955 is opposed by a surprisingly wide array of more than 100 organ izations representing both health care consumers and providers, women's health advocates, state insurance commissioners, unions, families and individuals with disabilities. The re are 22 states that require health plans to cover the services of licensed professional counselors or to offer such coverage, and 39 states have adopted mental health insurance requirements. S. 1955 would override all these laws and allow huge insurance premium hikes for sicker and higher-risk employee groups. The American Counseling Association is joining the Mental Health Liaison Group and the broader coalition of organizations in op posing HIMMA. ACA strongly encourages counselors to contact their senators to ask them to vote against S. 1955 should it come to the Senate floor.

State benefits laws and regulatory protections have been adopted because they are needed, and gettingrid of them is the wrong way to go about trying to improve private sector health insurance. \"The senator should vote against this dangerous legislation, which is opposed by a large array of disability advocates, health care consumer groups and insurance commissioners.

The elimination of ESSCP would end much-needed services to students in 103 school districts across 33 states and the District of Columbia.

RQuODE nominated Dahm\u00e9 for her innovation and her desire to help unem-ployed youth, which led Dahm\u00e9 tobecome one of the founding members ofthe first community-based training pro-gram in Qu\u00e9bec. Since becoming itsdirector in 1984, Dahm\u00e9 has steered theorganization toward developing a multi-tude of programs for different types ofclients, including unemployed workerswith a prolonged absence from theworkforce and women interested innontraditional jobs. The organizationhas also developed the Job Search Club,an outreach program for troubled youthand four youth employment programs.With an uncanny ability to see the larger picture, Dahm\u00e9 realized early onthe importance of exchanging expertiseamong community-based trainers byhelping to coordinate various researchprojects in the field. A founding mem-ber of the Quebec Association forEmployment Programs, she haspresided over the organization since itsinception in 1988. In 1992, she helpedfound the Canadian Coalition of Com-munity-Based Training, bringing to-gether employability programs fromacross the country.

I want spiritualityto be considered a psychologi-cal variable because we aresocial scientists. As social scien-tists, we need to concern our-selves with social issues. Wecan't be theologians or spiritualdirectors. That's not what we aretrained to be. We need to useinstruments that fit into thesocial science model. We haveto show reliability and validity.We need to have clear defini-tions (and) theoretical modelsthat are testable scientifically.Theological models can't fitinto that world.\" Narrowing the discussion to meaning making, rather thantheology, is what counselorsneed to do with their clients,according to Piedmont. \"Re- member,\" he said, \"spiritualityis not religion. So, to the ques-tion of whether it's appropriateto talk about spirituality with aclient, I say, why not? Spiritual-ity is about meaning, and that'sa good thing to talk about withyour client.\" Handle with care Amid the growing interest in applying such assessment tech-niques to counseling, it is key toremember that issues of religionand spirituality must be handledwith kid gloves, as their nuancesoften mean very different thingsto different people. Griffith recalled being inter- viewed for his Vanderbilt pro-fessorship eight years ago. Hisinterviewers asked about hisdissertation, which explored therole of spirituality and religionin counseling. \"I said, 'I alwaysapproach the topic of spirituali-ty much the way Moses ap-proached the burning bush inthe Christian Scriptures. Hewas told to take off his sandalsbecause it was holy ground. I really do believe that this isholy ground which we treadupon with very gentle andrespectful care.' \"One of my interviewers said, 'Actually, that's the JewishScriptures. It started in theHebrew Old Testament, so itmight be good to give credit tothe source.' It was a great casein point. I was considering theOld Testament as an exclusivelyChristian sacred document,when in fact it was originally aJewish sacred document. Shetook it with good nature, but itwas a great warning for me thatthese are very delicate issues.These are sensitive issues thatshould be talked about with del-icacy, gentleness and great carefor others.\" Griffith advises that clients need to invite therapists to inter-vene in this area. \"There is cau-tiousness around spirituality,\"he said. \"When counselorsdelve into issues of the soul,those are very delicate areas toexplore. There is this tendencyto boundary spiritual beliefs, to put them in categories andlabels, and to define one groupof people against another basedon those labels. So people arecautious about talking abouttheir deepest spiritual beliefsand feelings.\" Brunswick tends to use spiri- tual assessments such as thespiritual timeline with clientswho first volunteer informationabout their faith journeys.\"Usually I do it with peoplewho are currently in some sortof conflict with their faith expe-rience \u2014 with their image ofGod, with their sense of reli-gion or church,\" he said. \"It's away to sort of help determinewhat are the things about thattradition or that spirituality orthat experience that might becausing the conflict today. It'svery client-driven. I really wantthem to be the maker of themeaning of their own experi-ences. I certainly try to helpmake the exploration happen,offer insight and suggest possi-ble inferences that we can makefrom the experiences, but I real- ly hope that any insight they getcomes from them through usingthe assessment.\" Such techniques are also use- ful with clients who are notexperiencing a crisis of faith,Brunswick said. \"The spiritualtimeline is also used as an affir-mation tool as much as it is aclinical assessment,\" he said.\"It's not meant just to root outpathology or conflict or anxiety.It's also meant to be an affirma-tion of a person's particularjourney. Some people are cele-brating their faith experienceaside from other difficulties.This can be a really beautifulway for them to identify andhighlight what it is about theirexperience that they find souplifting.\" IDivine interventions Continued from page 15 Stacy Notaras Murphy is a pastoral counselor at PC&CCin Washington, D.C.
