Furthermore, the vaccine contains aluminium phospha te and sodium chloride. How effective is the vaccine? A major U.S. trial including 38,000 healthy children who underwent 4- dose vaccination with the heptava-lent vaccine yielded 97% protection against invasive pneumococcal dis- ease caused by the types of pneumo- cocci included in the vaccine. Fur- thermore, studies from the U.S. and Finland have shown that the vaccine prevents 6% of all otitis media cases, 34% of all pneumococcal-associated otitis media cases, and approx. 20% of all tympanostomy tube procedures associated with recurrent otitis me-dia. In addition, the vaccine may prevent approximately 20% of all x- ray diagnosed pneumonia cases. Does the pneumococcal vaccine protect against meningitis caused by the meningococcal bacterium? The pneumococcal vaccine does not protect against the meningococcal bacterium, which is the second most frequent cause of bacterial meningi- tis in Denmark. How long does vaccination protect? After a vaccination series, a child is considered to be protected against invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the seven pneumococcal types until the age of four. Above such age, invasive pneumococcal disease rarely occurs in children. Which interval is required between two vaccinations? Age 3-11 months at first vaccination: The minimum interval between the first and second vaccination is one month. The minimum interval between the second and third va ccination is two months. The third vaccination should be ad-ministered when the child is at least 12 months old. Age > 12 months at first vaccination: Two vaccines are given at a mini- mum interval of two months. Why should childre n above the age of 1 year only receive two vaccina- tions? In children above the age of one year, the immune system has ma- tured sufficiently to form adequate antibodies after two vaccinations. Is revaccination needed? Revaccination of healthy children who have received a full vaccination series is not recommended. In chil-dren above the age of two years with an increased risk of invasive pneu- mococcal disease, revaccination with the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine is recommended in accordance with the guidelines from the Danish Pae-diatric Society, EPI-NEWS 11/07. May the vaccine be given in con- junction with other vaccines? Yes, PCV7 may be given in conjunc-tion with e.g. the DTaP-IPV/Hib and MMR vaccines. The vaccines should always be given at separate injection sites. Which adverse effects may be ex- pected? Fever and local reaction presenting redness, swelling and tenderness around the injection site are frequent effects. After vaccina tion irritability, vomiting, diarrhoea and reduced ap-petite are also seen. Why should all children receive pneumococcal vaccination? The objective of the vaccination pro-gramme is to protect individuals as well as populations. When more per- sons are vaccinated, fewer remain to transmit the infection. A small num- ber of unvaccinated persons will be protected if only a sufficiently large proportion is vaccinated, as the bac-teria will not be able to circulate in the population. This is called herd immunity. Who should not be vaccinated? Children who are alle rgic to the in- gredients of the vaccine, including diphtheria toxoid. What is the difference between the two vaccines against pneumococci? The vaccine used in the childhood vaccination programme is a conju-gated vaccine containing capsule material from seven types of pneu- mococci which frequently cause in- fection in infants. The vaccine can be given from the age of 2 months. The other vaccine is a polysaccha- ride vaccine containing capsule material from 23 types of pneumo- cocci. This vaccine is ineffective in children below the age of two but recommended for children above the age of two years who are at in-creased risk of invasive pneumococ- cal disease and for healthy persons above the age of 64 years for whom the vaccine covers more than 90% of all cases of invasive pneumococcal disease. Are further pneumococcal vaccines in the pipeline? Within the next years, conjugated 10- and 13-valent pneumococcal vaccines covering 82% and 91%, re-spectively, of all invasive pneumo- coccal cases in children below the age of five years are expected to be approved. Type-i ndependent pneu- mococcal vaccines (Str eptococcus pneu- moniae) occur naturally in the nose and throat of persons of all ages worldwide. Carrier frequency is highest in children and particularly in those who attend day care and in adults who have close contact to children. How are pneumococci transmitted? Pneumococci are transmitted from person to person by sneezing, cough- ing or through direct contact. Which infections are caused by pneumococci? Pneumococci frequently cause acute otitis media, sinusitis and pneumo-nia. The most serious forms of inva- sive pneumococcal disease are sepsis and meningitis. How common is invasive pneumo- coccal disease? The highest occurrence of invasive pneumococcal disease is found in children under the age of two years and in elderly persons above the age of 64 years. In the period 2000-2005, the inci-dence among children below the age of two years was approx. 50 cases per 10 5 per year, which is approx. 2.5 times more frequent than in the total population. Invasive pneumococcal disease rarely occurs in older chil-dren and adults. In the same period, the incidence for elderly persons above the age of 64 years was approx. 70 per 10 5 per year. (P.
