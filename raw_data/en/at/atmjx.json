The pending rule becomes final and effective July 1, 2018, unless the rule is approved or rejected in part by concurrent resolution in accordance with Sections 67-5224 and 67-5291, Idaho Code. If the pending rule is approved or rejected in part by concurrent reso lution, the rule becomes final and effective upon adoption of the concurrent resolution or upon the date specifie d in the concurrent resolution. AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5224, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a pending rule. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 3 9-605, 39-906, 39-1603, 39-4502, and 56-1003, 56- 1005, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reason s for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change: Most of the larger hospitals in Idaho perform universal Critica l Congenital Heart Disease (CCHD) screening as part of the newborn screening panel. However, some of the small er, more rural hospitals and birthing centers do not. Idaho is the only state that does not have rules that cover the requirements for CCHD screening. This rule change adds CCHD to the uniform screening panel for all newborns in Id aho. Congenital heart defects are the most common birth defect and impact approximately 8 out of every 1,000 infa nts born. Of these, approximately 25% (2.4 per 1,000) are considered critical and require immediate detection and int ervention. In Idaho, it is estimated that approximately 55 infants are born each year with CCHD. The goal of CCHD scree ning is to identify and treat newborns with structural heart defects utilizin g a simple, cost-effective, and noninvasive screening test where oxygen saturation is assessed after the first 24 hours of life. Without this intervention, the rates of mortality and survival with significant disability are extremely high among infants with CCHD. This proposed rule change adds CCHD as a required screening and mandates that all newborns receive a CCHD screening shortly after birth. If the proposed rules are approv ed, the Department will add CCHD screening information to their birth certificate system in Vital Records. This would allow the Idaho Newborn Screening Program to monitor screening compliance and provide assistance to families including referrals for follow-up care on positive screens. The text of the pending rule has been amended in accordance wit h Section 67-5227, Idaho Code. Only those sections that have changes that differ from the proposed text a re printed in this bulletin. The complete text of the proposed rule was published in the September 6, 2017, Idaho Adm inistrative Bulletin, Vol. 17-9, pages 111-116 . FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: Federal funds will be used to cover the costs associated with implementation of these rules.

General hospital proced ural guidelines are being changed to provide a psychiatric services structure with which to align. General hos pital inpatient provisions are being changed to match current Medicaid practice and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requirements. Finally, under physician services, limitations for psychiatric evaluations and psychotherapy are being removed. Should the Department need to make adjustments to remain in compliance wit h federal requirements or to maintain appropriate utilization of services in the future, these changes will allow for modification for those needs.

The reimbursable reasonable costs for services rendered prior to the beginning of the princ ipal year, but included as prior period claims in a subsequent period's cost report, will be subject to the same op erating cost limits as the claims under settlement. (3-30-07) b. Application of the Medicaid Cost Limit. In the determination of a hospital's reasonable costs for inpatient services rendered after the effective date of a princ ipal year, a Hhospital Iinflation Iindex, computed for each hospital's fiscal year end, will be applied to the operating co sts, excluding capital costs and other allowable costs as defined for the principal year and adjusted on a per diem basis for each subsequent year under the Hhospital Iinflation Iindex. (3-30-07) ( ) i. Each inpatient routine service cost center, as reported in th e finalized principal year end Medicare cost report, will be segregated in the Medicaid cost limit calc ulation and assigned a share of total Medicaid inpatient ancillary costs. The prorated ancillary costs will be determine d by the ratio of each Medicaid routine cost center's reported costs to total Medicai d inpatient routine service cost s in the principal year. (3-30-07) ii. Each routine cost center's total Medicaid routine service co sts plus the assigned share of Medicaid inpatient ancillary costs of the principal year will be divided by the related Medicaid patient days to identify the total costs per diem in the principal year. (3-30-07) (1) The related inpatient routine service cost center's per diem capital and graduate medical education costs plus the prorated share of inpatient ancillary capital co sts will be subtracted from the per diem amount identified in Subsection 405.02.b.ii. of this rule to identify each inpati ent routine service cost center per diem cost limit in the principal year. (3-30-07) (2) If a provider did not have any Medicaid inpatient utilizatio n or render any Medicaid inpatient services in an individual inpatient routine service cost center in the fiscal year serving as the principal year, the principal year for only those routine cost centers without util ization in the provider's principal year will be appropriately calculated using th e information available in the next subsequent year in which Medicaid utilization occurred. (3-30-07) iii. Each routine cost center's cost per diem for the principal year will be multiplied by the Hhospital Iinflation Iindex for each subsequent fiscal year. (3-30-07) ( ) iv. The sum of the per diem cost limits for the Medicaid inpatie nt routine service cost centers of a hospital during the principal year, as adjusted by the Hhospital Iinflation Iindex, will be the Medicaid cost limit for operating costs in the current year. (3-30-07) ( ) (1) At the date of final settlement, reimbursement of the Medica id current year inpatient routine cost centers plus the assigned ancillary costs will be limited to th e total per diem operating costs as adjusted for each subsequent fiscal year after the principal year through the cur rent year by the H hospital Iinflation Ccost Iindex. (3-30-07) ( ) (2) Providers will be notified of the estimated inflation index periodically or Hhospital Iinflation Iindex (CMS Market Basket Index) prior to final settlement only upon writte n request.

Adjustments to the Medicaid Cost Limit . A hospital's request for review by the Department concerning an adjustment to or exemption from the cost limits i mposed under the provisions set forth in Section 405 of this chapter of rules, must be granted under the following c ircumstances: (3-30-07) a. Adjustments. Because of Extraordinary Circumstances. Where a pr ovider's costs exceed the Medicaid limit due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the co ntrol of the provider, the provider can request an adjustment to the cost limit to the extent the provider proves such higher costs result from the extraordinary circumstances including, but not limited to, increased costs attributable to strikes, fires, earthquake, flood, or similar, unusual occurrences with substantial cost effects. (3-30-07) b. Reimbursement to Public Hospitals. A Ppublic Hhospital that provides services free or at a nominal charge, which is less than, or equal to fifty percent (50%) of its total allowable costs, will be reimbursed at the same rate that would be used if the hospital's charges were equal to , or greater than, its costs. (3-30-07) ( ) c. Adjustment to Cost Limits. A hospital is entitled to a reasonab le increase in its Medicaid Ccost limits if the hospital shows that its per diem costs of providi ng services have increased due to increases in case- mix, the adoption of new or changed services, the discontinuation of services or decrease in average length of stay for Medicaid inpatients since the principal year. Any hospital maki ng such showing is entitled to an increase commensurate with the increase in per diem costs. (3-30-07) ( ) i. The Medicaid operating cost limit may be adjusted by multiply ing cost limit by the ratio of the current year's Ccase-Mmix Iindex divided by the principal year's Ccase-Mmix Iindex. (3-30-07) ( ) ii. The contested case procedure set for forth in IDAPA 16.05.03, \"Rules Governing Contested Case Proceedings and Declaratory Rulings,\" is available to larger ho spitals seeking such adjustments to their Medicaid Ccost Llimits. (3-30-07) ( ) d. Adjustment to the Proration of Ancillary Costs in the principal year. Where the provider asserts that the proration of ancillary costs does not adequately reflect the total Medicaid cost per diem calculated for the inpatient routine service cost centers in the principal year, t he provider may submit a detailed analysis of ancillary services provided to each participant for each type of patient day during each participant's stay during the principal year. The provider will be granted this adjustment only once up on appeal for the first cost reporting year that the limits are in effect. (3-30-07) 04. Payment Procedures . The following procedures are applicable to in-patient hospita ls: (3-30-07) a. The participant's admission and length of stay is subject to preadmission prior authorization , concurrent review, continued stay review, and retrospective review by a Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) designated by the Department. QIO review will be governed by pr ovisions of the QIO Idaho Medicaid Provider Manual as amended. If such a review identifies that an admission or continued stay is not m edically necessary, then no Medicaid payment will be made. Failure to obtain a timely QIO review as required by Section 40 52 of this chapter of rules, and as outlined in the QIO Idaho Medicaid Provider Ma nual as amended, will result in the QIO conducting a late review. After a QIO review has determined that the hospital stay was medically necessary, Medicaid will assess a late review penalty to the hospital as outlined in S ubsection 405 .05 of this rule. (3-30-07) ( ) i. All admissions are subject to QIO review to determine if cont inued stay in inpatient status is medically necessary. A QIO continued stay review is required when the participant's length of stay exceeds the number of days certified by the QIO. If no initial length of st ay certification was issued by the QIO, a QIO continued stay review is required when the admission exceeds a number of days as specified by the Department. (3-30-07) ii. Reimbursement for services originally identified as not medi cally necessary by the QIO will be made if such decision is reversed by the appeals process required in IDAPA 16.05.03, \"Rules Governing Contested Case Proceedings and Declaratory Rulings.\" (3-30-07) iii. Absent the Medicaid participant's informed decision to incu r services deemed unnecessary by the QIO, or not authorized by the QIO due to the negligence of the provider, no payment for denied services may be DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WE LFARE Docket No. 16-0309-1702 Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits PENDING RULE H - H EALTH & W ELFARE COMMITTEE PAGE 94 2018 P ENDING RULE BOOKobtained from the participant.

The pending rule becomes final and effective July 1, 2018, unless the rule is approved or rejected in part by concurrent resolution in accordance with Sections 67-5224 and 67-5291, Idaho Code. If the pending rule is approved or rejected in part by concurrent reso lution, the rule becomes final and effective upon adoption of the concurrent resolution or upon the date specifie d in the concurrent resolution. AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5224, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a pending rule. The action is a uthorized pursuant to Sections 5 6-202, 56-203, 56-250 through 56-257, and 56-260 through 56-266, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reason s for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change: The Department's Infant Toddler and Medicaid programs are both required by federal law (Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act) to pro vide access and reimbursement fo r early intervention services. Early intervention service requirements are being removed from IDAPA 16.03.10, \"Me dicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits\" and added as a new Section in this chapter. The rule text is being updated to support program eligibility, service coverage, limitations, provider, and reimbursement requirements. These ch anges will allow the Department more flexibility for collaboration within IDHW Divisions and ensure all Medicaid-eli gible infants and toddlers receive the right preventive services, at the right time, through the best financ ial means for the State. Updates to references or other minor technical corrections are being made as needed. Companion Docket No. 16-0310-1703 is publishing in this bulletin. There are no changes to the pendi ng rule and it is being adopte d as originally proposed. The complete text of the proposed rule was published in the October 4, 2017, Idaho Admin istrative Bulletin, Vol. 17-10, pages 272-279 . FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year as a result of this rulemaking: This proposed change impacts the Division of Medicaid and the D ivision of Family and Community Services. Currently both divisions support these services for children wi th special healthcare needs ages 0-3 through a combination of a federal grant a nd Medicaid benefits payments. This rule will enable additional Medicaid coverage for these se rvices, which will allow leveraging federal funds to support better services for Idaho. There is no overall impac t to the general fund; however, a transfer of general funds between divisions will be necessary. In addition, the FAC S division will require an increase of $1,129,800 in federal spending authority and will revert $1,126,700 in receip t spending authority. The net impact will increase federal expenditures for these ser vices but will not increase the general fund needs. This will allow us to increase services to children and use sta te general funds more efficiently.

If the pending rule is approved or rejected in part by concurrent resolution, the rule becomes final and effective upon adoption of the concurrent resolution or upon the date specified in the concurr ent resolution. AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5224, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a pending rule and is also adopting a temporary rule. The actio n is authorized pursuant to Sections 56-202(b), 56-264, and 56-1610, Idaho Code; House Bill 43 (2017); and Section 1915 (i) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396n). DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a concise explanatory stateme nt of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and a statement of any change between t he text of the proposed rule a nd the text of the pending rule: As part of the Jeff D settlement agreement and the adoption of HB 43 (2017) which is directly related to it, the Department has created the Youth Empowerment Services (YES) pro gram for children with Serious Emotional Disturbance (SED). The YES program will provide medical and beh avioral health assistance to this target population, including respite care. These rul e changes are needed so that t he Department can provide these services to YES Program participants in accordance with the Jeff D settlement a greement. This rulemaking adds new sections of rules to administer servic es and supports to be delivered under 1915(i) authority as a Medicaid state plan option. This will include th e service of respite care.

In accordance with Section 67-5226, Idaho Code, the full text o f the temporary rule is being published in this Bulletin following this notice. The text of the pending rule ha s been amended in accordance with Section 67-5227, Idaho Code.

The complete text of the proposed rule was published in the October 4, 2017, Idaho Administrative Bulletin , Vol. 17-10, pages 296-298 . TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor ha s found that temporary adoption of the rule confers a benefit in the fo rm of new services. These new services are being called Youth Empowerment Services (YES), and several other chapters of rules are implementing changes with the same effective date of January 1, 201 8, to meet the intent of the la w and the court-ordered settlement agreement. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year as a result of this rulemaking: The cos ts for the Youth Empowerment Services (YES) program were originally estimated in the fiscal note for House Bill 43 (2017) and funding was addressed in House Bill 31 3 (2017). A revised version of this fiscal note is presented in the follo wing paragraph. This rulemaking will have no impact to the State General Fund, but will have a federal fund spending authority impact of $2,968,400 in the Division of Medicaid for the last 6 months of SFY 2018. The Division of Behavioral Health's Children's Mental Health program reverted $1,181,600 G eneral Fund for services that do not draw a federal match in SFY 2018 under House Bill 313. The Division of Medicai d will leverage matching federal funds through Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) funding. In future years, as additional services are implemented as required by the lawsuit settlement agreement, there is an antic ipated annual ongoing cost of $8,300,000 ($2,363,200 General Fund/$5,936,800 federal funds).DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WE LFARE Docket No. 16-0310-1706 Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits PENDING RULE H - H EALTH & W ELFARE COMMITTEE PAGE 147 2018 P ENDING RULE BOOKIn addition to the above fiscal impact, Rule Docket 16-0318-1701 in the 2018 legislative session is bringing forward sliding scale premiums for participants with income lev els above 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, as directed under HB 313 in the 2017 legislative session.
