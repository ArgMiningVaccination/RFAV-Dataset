D.O.M.E. 1904 (June): Gillepsie (1925) notes: The first chiropractic school in California was started in June, 1904, at 1314 Telegraph Avenue, Oakland, and on January 24th, 1905, it was incorporated by Dr. H.D. Reynard, Maude L. Reynard, Dr. W.F. Booth, Dr. E.L. Lichty and Dr. Ruby A. Lichty. Later this school was broadened to include naturopathy in its curriculum, and at this time it enlisted Dr. Carl Schultz and his wife of Los Angeles. The seven people mentioned formed a naturopathic board with Dr. Schultz as president. They then besought the legislature of 1907 to pass a bill legalizing the naturopathic board with the power to issue licenses to naturopathic doctors. This bill was lost. 1904 (Sept): PCO returns to LA (Booth, 1924, p. 88) 1904 (Dec): DD and BJ publish first issue of The Chiropractor [1(1)]: -\"Harry H. Reynard, D.C. of Oakland, Cal., writes us: 'All the Chiro's seem to be doing fine.

Reynard of Oakland, Elza L. Lichty of Oakland, William F. Booth of Oakland, Isaac W. Bridenbecker of Oakland, and Joseph H. Merall of Berkeley CA, each of whom pays $25 into the corporation; articles are notarized by Oliver Young, Notary Public, and filed with John P. Cook, County Clerk, at Oakland; stated purpose of the corporation is: (a) to establish and maintain a college of learning in which shall be taught the science of Chiropractic and the sciences relating thereto, the structure and functions of the vertebrae and the cure of disease through the readjustment of the vertebrae, (b) the employment of and cooperation with such competent persons as will give instruction in Chiropractic and the principles cognate thereto, (c) the graduating of students who have secured such instruction, and the issuance to such students under the corporate seal of diplomas evidencing graduation, and (d) the acquisition, holding and managing of such real and personal property as may be necessary to effectuate the object of the corporation. 1905 (May): The Chirorpractor (1[6]), published by DD at the PSC, prints: -a letter from HD Reynard DC: Oakland, Cal., May 10, 1905 Dr. DD Palmer: Dear Old Dad: - Your letter came today in the form of The Chirorpractor ; was very glad to hear from you. The Chirorpractor is all right. I am sure that Weed letter made some person sick. I remember hearing Smith say once, that he wishedthat those other fellows would not teach Chiro, meaning Jones and Langworthy. When I first heard that the Governor had vetoed the Chiropractic bill in Minnesota, I felt real sorry, but since reading a copy of it, I feel satisfied that he did a noble act. I feel that there should be no medical laws, no political board of examiners. You may put it on record that the Chiropractors of California, always make it known that you are the Father, and the only Father of Chiropractic. Our literature always reads so. I am yours for pure Chiropractic. HD Reynard DC (p. 4) -a note re: naturopathy in California (p. 6): In Southern California, the Naturopath includes under the head of Materia Medica: 'That branch of medical science which treats of herbs, electricity, magnetism, massage, physical and mental culture.' Webster defines Materia Medica as a general term used for all substances used as curative agents in medicine. Dunglison says of Materia Medica: 'That branch of medical science which treats of drugs and the physiological phenomena produced by them in the human economy.' It looks to us as tho the Naturopaths had borrowed a term from the Medical School which they have no right to use, a term that does not cover the above remedies, except that of herbs. To use those suitable as an article of diet, would be all right, but under the head of Materia Medica, would be to use drugs as a medicine. -a letter from WE Ledyard DC and reply (pp. 7, 9): Oakland, Cal., April 28, 1905 My dear Doctor Palmer: Please answer the following questions in The Chiropractor. How do you adjust curvature of the spine? If by stretching, how do you stretch? Do you advise stretching by machine or by hand?\" WE LEDYARD, DC' We adjust the vertebrae of curvatures by hand, and never by a machine. We never stretch the spine by any means whatever.Wedge-shaped vertebrae make curvatures. These must be returned gradually to their former shape. To do this, there is much to be taken into consideration. The various curves of scoliosis, kyphosis and lordosis, are made by a great diversity of abnormally shaped vertebrae, which cannot be studied without specimens representing each kind. Add to these, those varying in consistency from as soft as chees in Osteo malacia to those as hard as ivory in specimens which have become eburnated. Then we find fractures, exostoses, ankyloses, and carious vertebrae. Each of these need special attention. Exostoses and ankyloses can be removed by continued proper adjustments, while those which have been fractured and more or less destroyed by caries, can not be returned to their normal condition. 1905: the Pacific School of Chiro-Practic, Inc., located at 1314 Telegraph Avenue, Oakland, California, issues its \"Announcement, Session of (Palmer Archives Call #B.J., LD, A5, and \"E.L. Lichty, D.C., W.E. Ledyard, M.D., D.C., W.F. Booth, D.C., The first graduates of the Pacific School of Chiro-Practic and the first graduates of any school of Chiropractic to receive a legal degree. All others have been complimentary\"; listed as members of \"THE BOARD Bridenbecker -text of the Announcement notes: Dr. Reynard is a graduate from the School of Dr. D.D. Palmer the discoverer and developer of CHIROPRACTIC, aand was the first chiropractor in Northern California. Definition of Chiro-PracticChiro-Practic is from two Greek words, Ki-ro, the hand, and Practos - done; done by the hand - a hand Practitioner - one who Adjusts - repairs with the hands - hand fixing.' - Dr. D.D. Palmer. It is the science of replacing with the hands any part of the human Anatomy that by accidents, such as falls, strains, wrenches, etc., may have become luxated (displaced) from their normal position. More especially the bones of the Spinal Column which when displaced press upon spinal nerves and thereby interfere with their function and cause a diseased condition in the part of the body that they govern. ANNOUNCEMENT THE PACIFIC SCHOOL OF CHIRO-PRACTIC As the first regularly organized and incorporated College of Chiro-practic in the State of California we make our bow to the people of this glorious commonwealth, especially to the young men and women who are looking for a place in one of the professions.... LOCATION Oakland, with its genial climate offers every advantage to the student. It is not only a city itself, but it has the extra advantage of being in close proximity to San Francisco, thus giving one the advantage of a large city without actually living in it. It has a fine Public Library always open to the student, and last but not by any means least is the opportunity offered for clinical demonstration by the poor of the cities around the bay who are anxious to regain their health and are not able to pay a regular Chiro-practic practitioner. COURSE OF STUDY The course of study covers a period of one year, divided into two terms of five months each. Students may matriculate at the beginning of each term. FIRST TERM Anatomy. Urinalysis. Toxicology. Physiology. Pathology. Symptomatology. Lectures on the Principles and Practices of Chiro-Practic. SECOND TERMAnatomy. Physiology. Symptomatology. Pathology. Minor Surgery. Medical and Chiropractic diagnosis compared. Chiropractic Technique, Clinical Demonstrations, Diagnosis and Practic. Hygiene and dietetics. TUITION AND EXPENSES The tuition is $500.00 payable in advance, or half down and balance note with approved security. Books necessary for the course will cost about $35.00, though any amount of money can be spent in reference books, charts, skeletons, etc. Expenses for board, rent etc., can be had from $25.00 per month up. ATTENDANCE Students are required to attend all classes unless excused by the professor in charge of the work. Sickness of self or friends will be the only excuse accepted for non-attendance.... THEORY AND PRACITCE OF CHIRO-PRACTIC The theory of Chiro-Practic is that luxations of bones cause disease. This theory is absolutely proven in the practice. Every move of the Chirorpactor is made with a definite object in view, each luxation requires a different move, therefore the student is taught to locate the luxation and to scientifically remove it. The knowledge must be exact. Random work will do more harm than good. CLINICS Ample opportunity is given the student in the clinic and sick rooms to gain a practical knowledge of Chiropractic Technique, and to become a competent Adjuster (Operator). And no student will be given a Diploma until he is thoroughly competent to take the patient, diagnose the case, and make the adjustments necessary, no matter how high they may stand in their other studies. MINOR SURGERY The senior class is drilled in the work of minor surgery. The text-book used is Wharton's Minor Surgery and Bandaging.1905: Carl Schultz MD, ND founds Naturopathic Institute of California in LA with $10,000 \"paid in capital\"; school continues until 1951 (SRI, 1960, p. 215) 1905: ER Booth, PhD, DO publishes his first edition of The History of Osteopathy (Booth, 1924) 1906: Los Angeles College of Osteopathy (LACO) is teaching broad osteopathy; inspected by Charles C.

Exponents of various healing arts, including some of these chiropractors, organized the Naturopathic Association of California, and in 1909 sought legislation to effect the establishment of a licensing board. An amendment to the medical law, having approval of the state medical authorities, was passed, by which anyone showing a certificate of membership in the association might receive the seal of the medical board, and this constituted a license. Educational and professional qualifications were not investigated. Two years later, this absurd law was repealed, but in the meantime, along with many indiscriminate drugless practitioners a number of chiropractors had gained credentials. The latter eventually became at odds with the majority of chiropractors, who under agreements of organization refused to acknowledge medical authority. 1908 (Feb 27): Charles Wood earns DC from National School of Chiropractic (Beideman, in press) 1909 (Jan 25): Thomas H.

The circular contains some valuable statments. For instance, it says: \"This society endeavors to impress on the public mind: That drugs, in whatever form, serums, vaccines, etc., are not only useless, but detrimental to the system. They suppress the symptoms of the disease at the cost of the patient's vitality, at the same time mislead people as to the true origin of disease. The only restorative factor in disease is the healing power of nature ('vis medicatrix naturae), if wisely preserved and directed. Many so-called scientists are still wedded to the superstition that drugs and serums cure, that by surgical operations the body's normal functions can be restored, that vaccines are preventive as if by magic. They are still looking for germs as the first cause of disease, because they cannot see beyond the microscope; they cannot recognize with their mental eyes that depleted vitality and disorganization of blood and tissues by wrong living are the underlying causes for all diseased conditions.\"The statements in the circular up to that point are not very objectionable, but in the next paragraph occur the following sentences: \"Every disease has its origin in unhygienic and perverted dietetic habits. The only permanent cure is rational living (sunlight, fresh air day and night, proper diet, adequate exercise and rest).\" I wrote to the circle, asking how they explained the results made by Chiropractors, if diseases are caused by \"unhygienic and perverted dietetic habits.\" The following correspondence then ensured: DR. CHARLES A. CALE Los Angeles, Cal., May 19, 1910 Dr. Charles A. Cale, 3737 Adair St., City. Dear Doctor: - Your kind letter of May 17th at hand. You evidently misunderstood our circular. We are not in the curing business, neigher do we conduct a repair shop for broken down human machines. Our aim is to teach people the principles of right living, in order to prevent disease. Chiropractic may be all right as far as it goes, but if the blood is impoverished and lacking in certain elements for its proper oxidation and purificaiton, you must supply these elements by proper selection of foods. I think by combining Chiropractic with proper diet you will be still more successful in your efforts. We do not say that all diseases are caused by perverted dietetic habits; we also say \"unhygienic habits\" which means, overwork, worry, sleeping in ill-ventilated rooms, lack of exercise, etc. We should be very much pleased if you would join our ranks and help the good cause along. We enclose application blank and remain, Most repsectfully yours, GLOBE HYGEINE CIRCLE.\" Los Angeles, Cal., May 20, 1910 Mr. Otto Carque, Pres. Globe Hygienic Circle, Dear Sir: - You have been kind enough to ask me to join the Globe Hygienic Circle. It would hardly be consistent for me to joing at present, and I will state the reason briefly. Your circular says: \"The only permanent cure is rational living (sunlight, fresh air day and night, proper diet, adequate exercise and rest).\" If thatis \"the only permanent cure,\" how do you account for the work which I am effecting by Chiropractic adjustments alone? I do not believe that \"rational living\" will ever cure a disease which is caused by nerve compression at the spinal foramina. Such diseases are readily reached by Chiropractic. Therefore, I think your circular is erroneous in its statement. Your circular also says: \"Every disease has its origin in unhygienic and perverted dietetic habits.\" But I believe that practically every disease has its origin in nerve compression at the spinal foramina. In proof of my statement, I can cite you to many persons made well by a few Chiropractic adjustments. And so, if I would join the circle, I would be helping to disseminate statements which I think are not true. If the circle will change its literature so as not to include any incorrect statements, I will joint. Will it do it? Respectfully, DR. CHARLES A. CALE Los Angeles, Cal., May 21, 1910 Dr. Charles A. Cale, City. My Dear Doctor: - Your kind letter of May 20th at hand. We are very sorry that we cannot accommodate you and must forego the pleasure of having you as a member of the Globe Hygienic Circle. We wish you the best of success in your chosen vocation, and remain, Most respectfully yours, GLOBE HYGIENIC CIRCLE. -letter from George A. Newsalt DC (pp. 43-4) Charles A. 44-6) Dr. M.P. Brown, Editor Chiropractor Dear Doctor: Enclosed please find a statment which I am using as part of a circular. It is creating a good deal of interest. Respectfully, DR. CHARLES A. CALE We, the undersigned students of the University of Southern California, have spent some time making an impartial investigationof the curative value of Chiropractic. We called personally upon a number of persons who have been adjusted byDr. Cale, and the following is a brief report of some of those whom we interviewed.\" We first called upon Miss S., on Grand Avenue. We found her a very enthusiastic believer in the Chiropractic system. She declares that she owes her life to Chiropractic. She also had a personal knowledge of a number of others who had been helped by the same method. We next interviewed Mrs. N., on West 36th Place, and found her very hearty in her praises of Chiropractic. One of the most remarkable cases investigated was that of Mrs. T., on Trenton Street. She had been almost blind for a number of weeks and was given up by one of the best eye specialists in Los Angeles. At that time she could hardly read the painted signs on the street cars. After taking Chiropractic for about six weeks she gradually began to improve and now, after four months, she ca read large type fairly well and her general health is much improved. (Note: Since the above was written Mrs. T. has so far improved that she can now read fine print quite readily. - Dr. Cale). Another interesting case was that of Mrs. H., on Santa Barbara Avenue, who was relieved of very annoying headaches. Her husband was also greatly benefited. He had been suffering from hayfever for a number of years. Mrs. G., on Maple Avenue, could hardly say enough in praise of Chiropractic. She had been prostrated before beginning the adjustments, but is now apparently enjoying good health. One of the most remarkable cases was that of a two-year-old baby, on Main Street. The child had suffered from infantile parlysis for more than a year. After adjustments for three months he is running around apparently fast regaining the full use of his limbs. Mrs. A., on Main Street, spoke very favorably altho she had only taken them for a short time -0 hardly as much as she needed. Mr. T., on West Santa Barbara Avenue, could hardly say that he had been helped. However, he had only taken six adjustments, but was going to continue and expected to take advantage of the special yearly offer that Dr. Cale makes.A very remarkable case was that of Mr. S., on Wall Street. For ten years his bread had been toasted for him and it had been necessary to have his oatmeal cooked for a number of hours to keep it from giving him great distress. Doctors had told him that tobacco was the cause of his indigestion. He began Chiropractic adjustments a few days ago. After two he was able to eat sausage, after three he ate canned sardines and fresh bread and his continued speedy recovery had been extraordinary. He had also had a bad case of catarrh of the nose and throat and that also seems much better. He is one of the most enthusiastic of the number whom we visited. Another very satisfactory case was that of Mr. H., on Trinity Street. He has received great help for his rheumatism and is rapidly improving. Of course, it was understood that the persons whom we interviewed were among those who had been most benefited, but the per cent of incurables is very small and failure is due more to the inconsistency of the patient than to any other cause. We found that Dr. Cale adjusts persons ranging in age from a month to seventy years old, and for every disease. He uses no medicine of any kind and seems to produce remarkable results without them. His adjustments are confined to the spine exclusively. In some cases it only requires a small number of adjustments to bring about a marked change in the condition of the individual, while in others it is necessary to continue them for a number of weeks. The Chiropractic method seems to have been especially helpful to those suffering from nervous disorders. Some of those interviewed seem to regard this method as a great step in the modern sciences. Dr. Cale is willing to give an examination free to any one. If for any reason he cannot help you he is frank to tell you so. Chiropractic is not faith cure, christian science, medicine, magnetism, electricity, osteopathy, massage, nor anything else, but just Chiropractic. Dr. Cale is a licensed, graduate, naturopathic physician. He was himself cured of liver trouble six years ago by Chiropractic, and he at once took up the study of the system, altho he hadeducated himself for a school teacher and had taught school for seven years. Mrs. Cale is widely known as the president of the Woodlawn W.C.T.U. She assists him on patients who call at the residence. The fundamental idea of the Chiropractic system is that the physical cause of disease is, with very few exceptions, due to some form of vertebral displacement, and that this cause can be removed by an adjustment of the spinal column, which may take one or more. Signed: M.M. LONGSHORE. R.T. HENDERSON 1910 (Sept): AP Davis teaches at a school in Pittsburgh PA until summer 1911 (Zarbuck, 1988b) 1910: Palmer (1910, p. 75) writes: ...You will be interested in the Dr. Story case as it demonstrates what can be done, in a moment, by replacing a vertebra. During the doctor's mental aberrations he was treated by a very prominent healer who used Suggestive Therapeutics...Suggestion, however, did not replace the displaced 4th cervical vertebra, did not relieve the pressure on sensory nerves... 1910: Carver wrote to DD Palmer (Palmer, 1910, p. 93) How much better it would have been in the case of Story, if, after having adjusted the luxated bone, you had been able to have gone on and driven out of his mind all of those adverse and morbid impressions\" (cited in Palmer, 1910, p. 93); DD replies: \"Immediately, instantly, Dr. Story was able to do his own 'auto- suggesting' after I had adjusted the displaced cervical. He was satisfied to remain in Los Angeles, the land of sunshine and flowers, avoiding the long cold winters of Wisconsin... 1910: \"Suspension by the neck is orthopedical. It has been practiced many years; it is given in orthopedic books. Thomas H. Story, D.C., of Los Angeles, Cal., has beenusing that form of treatment for eight years\" (Palmer, 1910, p. 187) 1910: Palmer (1910, p. 673) writes: ...I am pleased to know that other brains than mine are developing (not enveloping) this great work. So far, there is only two developments from other brains than my own; those are the bifid table from the fertile brain of Dr. T.H. Story of Los Angeles, Cal., and Dr. Henry's idea of placing the hands and arms along the sides of the patient's body to prevent 'bucking,' being rigid, getting their backs up, just at an unappropriate time. Thus I personally and willingly give credit where due... 1910: \"The science of Chiropractic makes another step forward, one in accord with, and demonstrated by, anatomy. this advance, like all others, with the one exception of the bifid table which should be credited to Dan Riesland or T.H. Story, has been made by me.\" (Palmer, 1910, p. 845); Riesland was probably a pre-1906 grad of PSC (Palmer, 1919) 1910: Turner (1931, p. 295) writes: The publication of Dr. Albert Abrams' Spondylotherapy in 1910 brought the condemnation of the American Medical Association This book advanced the theory that the organs of the body were governed by nerve centers in the spinal cord and could be made to dilate or contract by stimulating the nerve centers through the manipulation of the vertebrae. Dr. Abrams was vice-president of the California State Medical Society, president of Emanuel Polyclinic, president of the San Francisco Medical-Chirurgical Society, professor of pathology at Cooper Medical College and professor at Leland Stanford University. He was graduated as a doctor of medicine at University of Heidelberg before he had reached the age of twenty. He studied in Berlin, Vienna, Paris and London, and for many years was regarded as one of the foremost minds in his profession.1910: Eilersficken founds San Diego School of Chiropractic (SRI, 1960, p. 215); BJ lists a \"F.B.C.

The St. Louis Chiropractic College was incorporated under the laws of Missouri some months ago by L. William Ray, A.M., M.D., D.C., and three associates, and among the founders of this institution are some well qualified and able teachers.The union of the Palmer-Gregory College with the St. Louis College brings to the assistance of the excellent faculty of the St. Louis College the personal services of Alva Emery Gregory, D.P., M.D., D.C., who is now recognized as the greatest teacher and the greatest editor and author in the Chiropractic profession. The St. Louis will open its doors to students and begin active class work the coming fall, and the prospects are excellent for a good attendance and the class of students catered to are above the average in education and intelligence. The College course consists of two years of not less than nine months for each year, and the time in school will be devoted, by the teachers, to instruction in the most important, latest, best and most efficient Rational Therapy Methods, so that their alumni will be far in advance of the non-progressive Chiropractors turned out from ordinary Chiropractic schools. St. Louis is a most favorable location for a good institution, as living expenses are light, and this school has at hand ample laboratory facilities in anatomy, chemistry (urinalysis, blood tests, stomach fluid tests) and bacteriology. The special course of instruction which will be given in the St. Louis Chiropractic College, will qualify the graduates of this institution to register by examination, in states that have provided to license other doctors other than the regular M.D.s as have Illinois, Michigan, California, Washington and other states as they fall in line. The St. Louis Chiropractic College course of instruction will enable their graduates to qualify by examination and to receive regular medical license in several different states, where the state law does not require graduation from an AMA medical college before admittance to examination. This college will be a great honor and boost to the profession of progressive Chiropractic, and the old schools of Chiropractic shall be a thing of the past unless they widen out, when the public become wise to progressive Chiropractic.

You want to become better qualified, to handle successfully all forms of acute and chronic disease. You want to become qualified to go before the examining board of such states as Illinois, California, Washington and Michigan and secure a certificate for registration. The second year's course at the St. Louis College will qualify the present doctors of Chiropractic and other drugless practitioners to pass the examination required in these states. This school teaches progressive Chiropractic, which is much more successful in the treatment of all forms of acute and chronic disease, especially in stubborn cases of paralysis, rheumatism, constipation, chronic asthma and other stubborn forms of chronic disease.

The educational requirements necessary to qualify for the physician and surgeon certificate are a standard four-year high school course or its equivalent, and one year of work of college grade in each of the subjects of physics, chemistry, and biology, followed by a professional course of four years of not less than thirty-two weeks each (four thousand hours). Many osteopaths qualified as physicians and surgeons. For the drugless practitioner license the requirements are a standard four-year high school course or its equivalent, followed by a professional course of two terms of not less than thirty-two weeks each (two thousand hours). Other osteopaths preferred to qualify as drugless practitioners....From 1907 to 1919, osteopathic physicians and surgeons took and passed exactly the same State examination for licenses to practice as medical graduates. The medical board in 1919 arbitrarily refused to examine any more osteopaths for physician and surgeon licenses.

Davis is of Scotch-Irish extraction; born in Belfast, New York, in 1835; reared in Indiana from his fifth year; educated int he common schools and in Wabash College, Crawfordsville, Indiana; studied, first: the Botanic System of practice; the Thompsonian; the Eclectic; graduated in Rush Medical College in 1866-67; Pulte Homeopathic College in 1877; took a Post Graduate Course in New York, in Homeopathy and Ophthalmology in 1880; graduated inOrificial Surgery under Prof. E.H. Pratt; studied and graduated in Osteopathy in 1893 and 1894; in Chiropractic in 1898. Wrote three books -- \"Osteopathy Illustrated,\" \"Neurology,\" and lastly \"Neuropathy.\" He has the distinction of having the first place in the first Osteopathic School -- has kept abreast of the times in all advanced thought from every source. He has the endowment of an energy that knows no defeat nor stopping place, in his search for Truth, for the amelioration of suffering humanity. For this reason he has surmounted every obstacle thus far; and in the application of the sciences he has mastered, has but few equals, perhaps no superiors. Now, at an age beyond the ordinary, is active, with all of his mental faculties seemingly in as good condition as, if not better than, at any time in his life. He bears the distinction of being the head and front of physical manipulators. As a teacher of the Drugless Healing Sciences, has filled many places of distinction. As a teacher and practitioner throughout the United States, has treated creditablyand satisfactorily all the afflicted with whom he has come in contact, or dealt with. His career in Los Angeles is one of extreme activity, having a large and lucrative practice, which is increasing as the days go by. To be acquainted with him and know him is a source of gratification. His friends may be counted by thousands. His moral character is beyond reproach; his reputation is world- wide as an Author and Practitioner. To be treated by him is indeed a satisfaction and productive of good results. 1915: Benedict Lust MD, ND establishes department of chiropractic at his naturopathic school in NYC; FW Collins takes correspondence course from PSC and organizes the New Jersey School of Chiropractic, later renamed the Mecca College of Chiropractic, associates with Francis W.

Cale, who is now a student in the second year of the Los Angeles College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons. Dr. Cale stated that he was formerly associated with A.W. Richardson in the conduct of chiropractic college in the Mason Opera Building, but that A.W. Richardson was now conducting the California Chiropractic College. At present this institution had neither college facilities nor equipment and no students. Your committee was informed that in the Fall, night sessions would open for the teaching of students in chiropractic methods. Inspected by Dr. Molony 1915 (July 3): FHN [4(22)] BJ: (p. 2) OSTEOPATHIC CHIROPRACTOIDS Dear Dr. Palmer, Some time ago in one of your circular weekly letters you published a letter from Chas A Cale, Pres. of the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic in which he said he advised all his students to study 'Anatomy' at the Los Angeles College of Osteopathy, and that a dozen of them including himself was doing it. To show how well merited your wait was I'll tell you this. I had 3 friends here who were going to study Chiropractic. They had a lot of literature from the Palmer School and were headed there. One of them thought he would look up the Los Angeles proposition. He wrote to Cale and in a little while got a letter with the list of names of those of Cale's students who were 'studying anatomy,' etc. in the Los Angeles College of Ost. They wrote to them care of Cale's school and nearly every letter, except one to Cale himself was returned through the dead letter office. Catalogs though from the Los Angeles College of Osteopathy,from Shaw, the Sec. tell what a fine life work Osteopathy was, etc. began to arrive and letters were received. My friends found that the Chiropractic students of Cale were not such at all but had entered the Osteopathic School for the full course, were registered in catalogs. My friends wrote to the Sec. of Osteopathic School and said they wanted to study Chiropractic, not Osteopathy and asked about the price of his Anatomy instruction. No answer. It would seem Cale is simply a stool pigeon for the Los Angeles College of Osteopathy. How much per student he gets for diverting people who are thinking of studying Chiropractic to the Osteopathic College it would be interesting to know. Nice way of 'working for the legal recognition of Chiropractic' as Cale said in his letter to you he was doing, isn't it? 1915 (Aug 17): TF Ratledge writes to Charles B. Pinckham MD, sec'y of the Board of Medical Examiners (BME); letterhead indicates RSCS schools in \"Topeka, Kansas, Oakland and Los Angeles\"; Ratledge writes a \"follow-up\" letter requesting the requirements a school must meet to be approved by the BME, and notes that \"one school of a drugless character\" has been approved [Richardson's CCC] (Ratledge papers, CCCKC 1915 (Aug 19): Charles B Pinckham MD (now sec'y-treasurer of the CA BME, although letterhead says WW Vanderburgh DO is Treasurer) writes to TF Ratledge in response to inquiry of 8/17/15; notes Ratledge's \"address you made before Governor Johnson May 29, 1913, as follows: \"I don't believe and don't feel like these people (Medical Board) ought to be permitted to direct us, what we shall study and the way we shall study when we have principles of our own science which are absolutely and diametrically opposite those of medicine\"; Pinkham also indicates that in June, 1915 the BME had \"approved the California Chiropractic College for one thousand hours, such approval continuing until December 1st, 1915 and being contingent upon theproper conduct of the institution. After carefully examining and personally visiting each institution professing to teach a drugless system in this state, the Board determined that the California Chiropractic College was the only one which came anywhere near meeting the requirements of an institution professing to qualify applicants for examination for a drugless certificate under the exactions of the Medical Practice Act.\" (Ratledge papers, Cleveland/KC) 1915 (Sept 8): letter to TF Ratledge from J. Thornley DC, ST of 502-3 Bank of San Jose Bldg, San Jose and the Universal Hotel in Palo Alto indicates tuition is $75 at CCC, and that CCC claims to be \"recognized\" and that graduates \"are eligible to take the medical examination and therefore get a license\"; Thornley asks for Ratledge's advice (Ratledge papers, CCCKC Archives) 1915 (Sept 9): TF Ratledge writes to someone with initials \"WHJ\" (first page of 3 missing) re: Richardson's CCCKC Archives); TF notes of BME that: The Richardson school was only approved for 1000 hours, and for that only until Dec. 1st, 1915, and I have every reason to believe that it will not be continued over a longer period of time. Then, you can see that it is a scheme to get us under their thumb and then crush us out of existence. First they make a pretense to approve a Chiropractic school, although they say 'that it was far from deserving such approval' then they withdraw that approval after we have been all led up to the chopping block and politically decapitated... -TF recommends the best protection against BME is to join the UCA, and that no entanglements with BME (such as Richardson's CCC's collaboration) -TF asks WHJ to say hello to Dr. Bullis [presumably of the Oakland Chiropractic College; see Autumn 1911 and 1915; see SRI, 1960, p.

The name is The LOS ANGELES COLLEGE OF CHIROPRACTIC\"; Ratledge indicates that Anna Foy of Kansas BCE has agreed to refuse license applications from CCC grads [which may not be true...see 9/23/15]; see also CCC, 1917-18, wherein Richardson also claims to have been head of LACC in 1912-13; Ratledge indicates that his school now teaches a 2400 hour, 20 month course, but only 2 students are enrolled (Ratledge papers, Cleveland KC) 1915 (Sept 23): TF Ratledge writes to CB Pinkham MD, sec'y of CA BME; notes that although CCC had been approved by BME, CCC had no more equipment than did Ratledge College; notes that \"they have employed First-Year Osteopathic a local school, and M.D.s astheir \"Chiropractic\" instructors....a knowledge, ever so complete, of Medicine or Osteopathy does not in any degree educate in Chiropractic, but, to the contrary, educates away from Chiropractic, there being radical differences in their teachings in most every subject....\" (Ratledge papers, CCCKC Archives); mention of osteopathic students may Charles and Linnie Cale 1915 (Sept 28): TF Ratledge writes to Kansas BCE c/o Anna Foy DC; notes CA BME has approved CCC \"which school is headed by a man who in my opinion, is absolutely without principle....He was initiated into Chiropractic in the summer of 1912 and graduated after taking a twenty-day lecture course....having as instructors first-year Osteopathic students and some M.D.s of none too high station in their own ranks; notes that Ratledge College is \"now entering upon a two-year course....or a total of two thousand four hundred hours...\"; asks Kansas BCE to approve the Ratledge College (Ratledge papers, CCCKC Archives) 1915 (Oct 5): Wm R Molony MD, vice-president of CA BME & Chairman of the College Investigating Committee writes to RA Ratledge, sec'y of Ratledge Chiropractic College re: \"what the Board would expect of an approved Drugless School\": anatomy 485 hours, histology 115 hours, elementary chemistry and toxicology 70 hours, physiology 200 hours, elementary bacteriology 40 hours, hygiene 45 hours, pathology 150 hours, diagnosis 370 hours, manipulative and mechanical therapy 260 hours, gynecology 100 hours, obstetrics 165 hours, many other details; letterhead indicates BME members include Dean L Tasker DO of LA and WW Vanderburgh DO of SF (Ratledge papers- CCCKC) 1915 (Oct 5): TF Ratledge writes to Dr HC Graham of Santa Maria CA; notes that he has received a Richardson letter from Graham; asks Graham to write to CA BME to inquirewhether his Ratledge diploma qualifies him to sit for drugless practitioner exam; asks Graham to write to Richardson and get him to sign reply (Ratledge papers, CCCKC Archives) 1915 (Oct 5): TF Ratledge (Ratledge papers, CCCKC Archives): One 'AW Richardson,' who is the chief of traitors to Chiropractic and the 'ward-heeler' for the Medics here and is one of Gregory's ardent followers....many of his statements have been found to be untrue. Another statement which I also think is false is that he is a graduate in Chiropractic from the same school from which you graduated and as I cannot remember the name of said school or who had charge of it, I cannot check it up in any way other than asking your assistance....he claims seven years practice as a Chiropractor, and in 1913 he claimed the same years, which if true then should be nine years now... He is now trying to get all the Chiropractors here to go before the Medical Board for examination under a bill which is somewhat of the same Character of the Ohio bill, and many of them are for it, and it is going to be a great injury to our contentions that they are incompetent to examine us and will make it appear that we are provided for in law. I, with a few of the tried and true are going to resist all such to the last and now anticipate enjoining the Board to prevent them giving the examination and harrass them as much as possible and all the information I can get relative to the fraud of this fellow will help to show that the Medical men have combined with the incompetent crooks in our profession to get the advantage of us and destroy chiropractic in this State. 1915 (Oct 6): TF Ratledge writes to BJ Palmer (Ratledge papers-SFCR Archives): If you know the school from which Carver graduated, which no doubt you do as it was an Iowa institution, I would consider it a great favor for you to determine if possible if A.W. Richardson graduated from that school and if so, when.He is claiming now that he has been a Chiropractor for seven years and he made the same statement in 1913, which if true then would make him a graduate nine years now. He is in some kind of deal with the Medical Board now trying to get all Chiropractors to present themselves to the Board for examination and licenses, and is, no doubt, expecting to get one himself, but, if what I have been able to determine to date is true, he took up Chiropractic the first time here in 1912 under Gregory and is not entitled to go before the Board for examination under the 1000 hour-three year clause even, although I understand that he expects to get in under the six-year practice clause... Everyone of the Chiropractors who have had any of the 'Oswalt' tendencies have joined in an attempt to get a license from the Medical Board under the Drugless Practice provision of the Medical law and there are only a few of us to carry on the campaign.... -Richardson will continue to claim seven years experience as a DC in 1917 (CCC, 1917-18, p. 3), and in 1944 (Apr) he will claim 27 years experience (Ratledge papers-CCCKC Archives) 1915 (Oct 7): TF Ratledge writes to Anna M Foy DC, President of the Kansas BCE; notes CCC's approval by CA BME, again refers to CCC as \"crooks and incompetents\" and that he will claim CCC has \"no educated Chiropractors at any time as instructors in their school\"; asks Foy to have KS BCE write to CA BME to say that Ratledge College is only California school they recognize; notes that 90% of DCs in CA believe Richardson's and CCC's papers, Archives) incompetents\", and urges BJ to \"repudiate\" approval by the CA BME (Ratledge papers, CCCKC Archives): Well, the next thing that happened was for the Board to call Richardson to Sacramento for a conference and since he cameback I understand that there is a rumor that your school is to be approved.... ...We can at least prevent the Chiropractors, or any considerable number of them from trying to get a license from the Medical Board. Then they will all be glad to get into the UCA where once in good company, will follow the policies of same... 1915 (Oct 8): TF Ratledge writes to Willard Carver to ask that Carver write to the CA BME to indicate that \"this school is the only school in California which is a CHIROPRACTIC school...\"; notes that (Ratledge papers, CCCKC Archives): At their first meeting in June they got their heads togetwer with AW Richardson, a twenty-lecture graduate of Gregories, and placed their approval upon the school...which he has 'hollered' until his throat was sore.... 1915 (Oct 30): TF Ratledge writes to BJ Palmer re: his court case and that he will discuss it with Tom Morris, UCA counsel; also re: Richardson's chiropractic training; notes \"have heard directly from Dr. Parker who says he cannot recall any such perseon as him ever having attended his school, but asks that I send him a picture of said individual to make sure, which I will do.\"; also notes CME spies (Ratledge papers, SFCR Archives): Am informed that the Medical Board has someone in the California school who reports everything to the Board as soon as anything is sprung there, and presume that they were responsible for Richardson's going to San Francisco so soon after the Secretary and Counsel for the Board were here to 'fire' the Inspector. The real facts of the case are these, Somner had gotten so close to Richardson and his herd of dupes that he, because of purported friendship, could not continue without embarrassing the Board... I have some of Richardson's letters and the latest indicates that he is willing to make NO promises but says that he has assurances that the Board will abrogate the matter of 'practice' which is one of the prerequisites for examination, and will givelicenses to his students on the 'six year plan,' which is indeed weak, but he has to make some kind of pretenses I guess. 1915 (Nov 8): TF Ratledge writes to BJ: \"Two hundred Chiropractors graduates of Richardson school who have made application to the medical Board meet here Monday night, December 14, to consider withdrawing their applications. Entire Richardson bunch are in very bad.

Wood DC, who will found the ECC and later purchase and preside over the LACC from 1924-1947 [Chirogram 1931 (Dec); 7(10):8]:In 1916 there was an amendment made to the Medical Act which has been known as Section BB, which permitted the Medical Board to grant licenses to drugless practitioners who had completed a course of 2000 hours in a legally chartered school or college \"approved by the board.\" There were about one hundred practitioners licensed under this provision, but in a short time the Board withdrew its approval from certain drugless schools that had been approved, and since that time there have been very few licensed under the above provision.

The California 'Chiropractic' College with the support and approval of the State Medical Board is gone, Richardson, it's President and 'friend of the Medical Board' is under arrest at Sacramento, arrested BY the Medical Board on a charge of perjury and all of his followers floundering upon the rocks of disappointment and disgraceful failure; Cale's school IS and that is all, it being completely discredited while we are just the same as when we started except that the people now know where Chiropractic is represented in California.

Richardson and Jos. Cook, of the CHIROPR ACTIC college, 207 Powell St. \"Her complaint charges them with assault by violence to do great bodily harm. She declares she was urged by Cook to visit the college and receive treatment. She had been suffering from nerve trouble, she said. \"While the CHIROPR ACTIC say she was given the usual treatment, which consists of tapping certain nerve centers, Miss Chesterly says she received such blows in the back that she suffered extreme pain. \"An interesting legal fight is anticipated as CHIROPR ACTICs are expected to line up with Dr. Richardson in proving that the treatment would have proved beneficial if the patient had allowed him to complete it. \"Testimonials of other patients, books on CHIROPRA CTIC treatment and possibly even an exhibitionof treatment is expected when the charges are heard before Polic Judge Fitzpatrick. - San Francisco Daily News, 9-27-18. ------\"DOCTOR ACCUSED - CHIROPRACTOR CHARGED WITH ASSAULT BY ACTRESS HE TREATED WITH \"PLESAMETER\" \"HUNG BY HEELS \"Miss May Chesterly, a vaudeville dancer and singer, swore to warrants before Police Judge T.I. Fitzpatrick today, charging James Cook and A.W. Richardson, a Chiropractor, of 207 Powell St., with assault. \"According to the story told by the actress in court, Cook sent her to the doctor for treatment for nervous breakdown. In his consultation room Dr. Richardson struck her on the back of the neck with an instrument which he called a \"plesameter,\" [sic] and then asked her if she could feel the end of her fingers tingle. She said she could not and the doctor struck her another blow, which not only \"caused her fingers to tingle but also caused her great pain.\" \"After this preliminary treatment, she was told to disrobe and the doctor and his assistant then suspended her by the neck and heels between two chairs. She remained in this position until she got discouraged, she told the court, and then went home to the Hotel Alexander and went to bed. As soon as she recovereed from the treatment, she called up an attorney and the complaint for warrants was made. \"The actress declares she lost her position as result of her injuries and asks $5000 for physical injuries and $500 for the loss of the job. A.W. Richardson, said to be one of the owners of the college, is made a defendant in this suit. - San Francisco Examiner, 9-28-1918. ------ \"CHIROPRACTORS OF STAGE HAND LEAD TO SUIT HIPPODROME CHORUS MAIDEN CAUSES ARREST OF TWO PRACTITIONERS \"Chiropractics by \"Dr.\" Jimmy Cook, stage hand at the Hippodrome Theater, almost proved fatal to Mae Chesterly, twenty-three-year--old chorus girl at the Hippodrome, according to her demand for warrants for Cook and Dr. G.A.Richardson yesterday. At the same time she filed a civil suit demanding $5500 in damages. \"Miss Chesterly sought treatment for a sore shoulder resulting from a fall, and after being treateed by a vibrator, a lecture on the general principles of Chiropractics was given her, she told the district attorney's office. This, she said, ended with a physical demonstration to show her just how much the practitioners knew of their science. This demonstration, she avers, consisted of hitting her at the base of the skull with a mallet after she was dragged by the ears across the operating table. This caused the bones behind her ears to \"rattle, crack and snap,\" and she fainted, she says in her complaint. Since then, she says, the chords of her neck have swollen so that her head is drawn almost to her right shoulder. She says she is under the care of a physician at the Hotel Alexander and has had to give up her stage work. \"Cook has been active in sending patients to the Richardsons, the actress told the district attorney's deputies, mostly from the Will King company, where he is employed as a stage hand. Cook is studying Chiropractics, but has not recieved a license, and also lays claim to powers of hypnotism and necromancy and of being the \"Delphia Sybil of the dead,\" she says. \"C. Randall Sparks, attorney for the young woman, said: \"\"There probably wouldn't have been any suit if the 'doctors' had not gone outside their case to show the patient how much they knew by hitting her with a so-called plexometer and a mallet to maker her fingers tingle.\" \"Bail of $1000 was demanded of both Richardson and Cook. In the civil suit filed $500 was asked for loss of wages and $5000 for personal injuries. Dr. A.W. Richardson, president of the Calfironia Chiropractic College, is made a co-defendant in the civil action. According to Sparks, President Richardson advised his brother and Cook to settle the case by payment of $125 to the girl before the suits were filed, admistting the practitioner had hit the girl too hard.\"Dr. Richardson and Cook was arrested by Policeman Michael Walsh.

Randall Sparks, has prepared a civil suit against Dr. Richardson, his brother and Cook, asking damages to the amount of $5500. The $5000 is for the suffering she has been forced to endure as the result of the \"treatment,\" and the $500 for the loss of her position with the Will King burlesque company at the hippodrome Theater, where she was employed. \"Miss Chesterly, in her civil complaint, states that she had been forced to engage a regular practitioner of medicine to undo the harm resulting from the Chiropractic treatment. \"She asserts that she will be unable to resume her theatrical work for some time and claims that her suffering has been intense, her head being bent in such a way that it almost touches her right shoulder. \"Miss Chesterly, according to the complaint, has been confined to her bed at the Hotel Alexander, where she resides, and has been in a state of nervous collapse as the result of Dr.Richardson's treatment of her. - The Bulletin, San Francisco, Sept. 27, 1918. --------- \"Thank goodness, whoever, wherever you find the spurious, you'll also find the real.

DR LINNIE May 10, 1919.Dear Dr. Palmer: - Today is the first day I have had an opportunity to write the particulars relative to my \"Trial and Acquittal,\" and enclosed in this letter you will find newspaper write-ups in regard to same. The result of this has been a lot of good FREE publicity and a great many new patients; three of whom served as JURYMEN. Get the Idea; all else Follows. It has proven to be a great Victory for Chiropractic in California and has in a large measure set right many misunderstandings. Gov. Morris is absolutely the greatest asset the Chiropractic profession could possibly have in the way of legal talent and the way he handled the situation reminded me of a First Class book agent; always on the alert to drive home a counter argument that knocked the pins from under the enemy. From the time the Trial started, I felt confident Victory was ours and I am happy to say, \"I was not disappointed.\" Words utterly fail me in expressing my Gratitude towards him and my Regard for him as a member of the Greatest Protective Association the Chiros have today in The U.C.A. I never fully appreciated the Protection accorded a Chiropractor in time of trouble until I, myself was a victim of same but that is the case with a great many, otherwise they all would be members of the U.C.A. Take it from me and from one who knows and who has been through the mill, \"I appreciate the U.C.A. beyond expression.\" \"You Chiropractors,\" who are not members, get into the U.C.A. and do it in P.D.Q. time; YOU owe it to the Science of Chiropractic, (which is your bread and butter) yourself, your fellow members, and to those who are fighting for the Cause of Chiropractic with every breath. You Chiropractors who read this, know that every statement made herein is the TRUTH, based upon actual experience, \"ARREST.\" Lend a helping hand to a Just and Righteous Cause, by joining the U.C.A. for in Union, there is Strength; the World war demonstrated this and what the Result? (VICTORY, of COURSE). Let every Chiropractor unite into one solid body and WE, too, will Go Over The Top. Yours, for straight Chiropractic, E.B.

Any movement that has his opposition might just as well be abandoned, on account of his weighty influence. -Charles A. Cale notes BJ's comment that \"no one can work with TF Ratledge\" and suggests (p. 5): ...I hope no one will ever ask me again if Dr. Ratledge and I have gotten together. There are five Chiropractic school presidents in California and all of them but Dr. Ratledge are working harmoniously together for the Chiropractic Petition. Since four out of five agree upon the Bill, and since \"BJ\" says he will not oppose the Bill, can any reasonable person see any cause for discouragement in our fight for the adoption of our bill.... \"BJ\" Knows If our Chiropractic Bill were a vicious one, does anyone suppose for one minute that \"BJ\" would not oppose it? HIS LIFE FOR TWENTY YEARS HAS BEEN ONE CONSTANT BATTLE AGAINST THINGS WHICH WOULD INJURE CHIROPRACTIC. He certainly would fight our bill if it was very detrimental to Chiropractic. -BJ writes (p. 6):....Ratledge is a straight, specific, pure and unadulterated Chiropractor. He's for the same as I am. He practically insults every Chiropractor he wants support of and from. He can't concede any strength or viewpoint of value in any other person's ideas OF HOW THINGS OUGHT TO BE DONE. They could be agreed on principle and then he would insult them on policy.... Another way of expressing the local conditions, between the two local men, is to say that Ratledge has ideals but no ability or ambition or accomplishments. Dr. Cale, on the reverse, hasn't the Chiropractic ideals vision, but he has the ability, ambition and accomplishment. Given the two I would rather have Dr Cale's contrast, for the ability to accomplish WILL come the ideals, for men can't work to the end of nothing all the time. In the given years that each of these men have had to show what they were or could do, or even tried to do, it appears to me now that Dr. Cale has tried to do much, much of which I don't agree with, and Dr. Ratledge has argued and talked much, with all of which I agree, but he hasn't accomplished a thing but gotten practically all the chiropractors disgusted, dissatisfied and discouraged with him and his tactics. As is see it, Dr. Ratledge is being regarded as a has-been, a once-runner, a cold-potato. Having failed, they are now looking to Cale to see if he can pony up to the scratch, make a home-run. Whether he will, with his mixing of Chiropractic, remains to be seen. But he can't do any worse than Ratledge, so let's take a fling and give him the opportunity. -BJ reports (p. 6): Last night, at the Gamut Club, Dr. Cale had his eighth birthday anniversary celebration. The Los Angeles College of Chiropractic was just eight years old, and it was celebrated by speaking, music; a play and dancing followed. -BJ reports (p. 7): Dr. Cale kindly asked me several days ago if I would address them. Then was when I wired you for the Lyceum Film. I talked about 15 minutes on salesmanship, printer's ink, and I think put over a big message in a few minutes; this was followed with the film. It sure meets with applause....Out of that audience of possibly 200 Chiropractors or close Chiropractic friends, I doubt if there were over three who were at this last Lyceum, and I doubt if there were over 25 who had ever attended any. A movement was started last night to get a special Pullman from LA, another from SF, another from Portland and one from Seattle, all to meet at Salt Lake City and make a special train out of there. Dr. Cale made a motion, seconded by all present, that \"Spizz\" Parsons be given full charge between now and then to work up this special car for next year. -FHN reports that as of 1/1/20 the PSC \"will accept no more students for less than a three-year course\" (of 6 months each); \"The $300 cash...\" 1919 (Nov 8): FHN (Vol. 9, No. 8) reports 8th anniversary of LACC, war between Drs.

The counties the most active in the work were Los Angeles, San Franicsco, San Bernadino, Santa Barbara, San Diego and San Jose. \"Los Angeles County secured a large percentage of the names, but the bill has the support of 95 per cent of the Chiorpractors, and all the counties have been well represented, financially and morally.\"\"This bill was formed at the convention of over one hundred Chirorpactors. It is a broad bill, and not only provides for straight Chiropractors, but Sec. II of the bill says: 'Chiropractors may use all natural agencies such as light, heat, electricity, food, hydrotherapy, mechanical and manual manipulations.' So you will see that we are barred from nothing but medicine and surgery. \"Several other states are anxiously waiting to see what California is going to do, as all states will regulate the practice of Chiropractic in a very few years, so our victory not only means the liberation of California, but other states, which in turn will see what can be done by conducting a thorough campaign and by uniting the Chiropractors for one big definite aim. \"I suppose you know that thirteen states have Chiropractic boards, namely, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho, North Dakota, North Carolina, Florida, Connecticut, Nebraska, Kansas, Arkansas, Vermont and Minnesota. \"The bill provides for all who have honestly earned their diploma from a chartered school. We cannot, of course, recognize a correspondence course, but there is an allowance made for those who have been in actual practice and hold a residence diploma. The line is drawn where it should be, yet all the legitimate practitioners are provided for, and those who have not been in practice can take the examination. The Chiropractors do not object to studying a thorough course of 2,000 hours and some of our schools have increased the course to three years, or 3,200 hours, so that the doctors of medicine can no longer accuse us of wanting to get by 'easy.' The medical law requires only 2,000 hours for a drugless practitioner. \"Chiropractors have no objection to taking an examination before a state board, but they will never consent to be examined by the medical board, which is composed of their professional competitors. It would be just as reasonable to ask a Republican campaign speaker to go before a Democratic campaign committee to secure his credentials, or to ask a Protestant clergyman to go before a board of Catholic priests to secure his license to preach, as it is to ask a Chiropractor to go before a medical board. The medical board looks upon Chiropractors as fakes and quacks,therefore they could not give an unbiased examination. Besides, the members of the medical board have not studied Chiropractic, because it is not taught in their schools nor explained in their text- books. How, then, could the medical board test the proficiency of the Chiropractors? It could not. But a Chiropractic board would test the Chiropractors in regard to their efficiency as competent adjusters, and thus the public would be safeguarded from incompetent practitioners. \"The medical board wants to confine its examination of Chiropractors to those who come from schools approved by the medical board, but they will not approve any of the Chiropractic schools, either in California, Iowa or in any other state. \"The Chiropractors almost secured the passage of their bill by the Legislature this year, but they were tricked out of it by the schemes of the Medical Trust. So now we appeal to the voters for a square deal. \"Drugless healers made the highest percentage of cures of cases during the influenza epidemic last winter, and they believe the people will not want to see them persecuted out of existence by the Medical Trust.\" 1920 (Mar 4): TF Ratledge writes to referendum on chiropractic law (Ratledge papers- CCCKC): The passage of this bill by a vote of the people of the great State of California will add prestige to the profession all over the World, whereas the defeat of the bill by the people will be heralded by the medical trust as an argument against the legal recognition of Chiropractors everywhere. The State Supreme Court of California and the United States Supreme Court have upheld the constitutionality of the iniquitous medical law of California. Dr. Hubley has been sentenced under that law to go to jail six months. Dr. Hubley says he is willing to go to jail for six months for Chiropractic, but even if he does, that will not change the law. That vicious medical law will still be there when he gets out of jail. The Judge who sentenced Dr. Hubley admitted to Dr. Cale that the adoption of the bill by the people in November would cancel the jail sentence of Dr. Hubley....I am convincedthat the weight of your influence would be worth fifty thousand votes in this campaign...This bill does not contain the unjust exaction of a high school diploma, but if this bill fails, a high school diploma requirement will probably be included in any other bill drawn up in this State.... 1920 (May): The Federation News (2[3]) (of the National Federation of Chiropractors) notes: -trials of J.M Compton DC of Oakland & A.B. Hinkley in Martinez CA (p. 6): The case of J.M. Compton, of Oakland, came up Thursday, April 7, in the police court. The jury was out just twelve minutes, took one ballot, and brought in a verdict of not guilty. A.B. Hinkley's trial in Martinez last month resulted in a hung jury - four for conviction, eight for acquittal. It looks as if he would not be tried again. Editor's Note: The Federated Chiropractors of California and the affiliated local and county associations are all pledged not to pay fines but to serve time in jail if convicted. The members are pledged to do this in making applications for membership. None but straight Chiropractors are acepted as members in the Federated associations. -James Compton DC authors \"A California Martyr\" (p. 6): In the Superior court of Alameda County, California, on April 22, Linden L.D. McCash, Chiropractor, of Berkeley, was found guilty of practicing medicine without a license. The fine was fixed at $200, which he refused to pay, because 75 per cent of all fines collected in this manner goes into the pocket of the state medical board. It is manifestly inconsistent for a Chiropractor to pay good money to the medical board, to be used by them in employing \"stool-pigeons\" or for other equally disreputable purposes, the ultimate object being to brand the Chiropractic profession as law- evading charlatans, that they themselves may more firmly fasten their poisonous fangs upon society. The medical hierarchy, who masquerades as the custodian of the people's most sacred rights, will now have the supreme pleasure of seeing a dangerous competitor who possesses superior professional qualificationsspend one hundred days in the Alameda County Jail at Oakland. Doctor McCash commenced his jail term on April 23. Our constitution says that all citizens shall have the right of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, but the State Medical Board says that in the case of Chiropractors all Constitutional guarantees shall be suspended, moral rights ravished and demands for self- determination denied. 1920 (May Hubley, Leiser, Boswell, Calvert, Barlow, Neilson and Butler, according to letter from State Chiropractic Society to BJ Palmer (pp. 6-7) -full page ad (p. 8) from BJ says: 100 D AYS IN JAIL Belongs to the No-Fine, Go-To-Jail Club LD McCash, D.C.

McCash DC of Berkeley, who is serving 100 days in jail in Oakland for unlicensed practice; McCash is secretary of the Alameda County Chiropractors' Association (ACCA) and vice-president of the Federated Chiropractors of California\"; McCash is quoted: (p. 10)Not one member of the State Medical Board of Examiners is instructed in Chiropractic, yet the board is given authority to pass upon the eligibility of men in any profession. At present it is impossible for a chiropractor to obtain a license and there never has been a license issued to a chiropractor, as such. I chose to go to jail in place of paying a fine of $200 for the reason that 75 per cent of the fines go to the state board to prosecute other members of my profession. It is a matter of moral freedom, whether or not a man has the right to practice his profession free from the tyranny of the State Medical Board of Examiners, none of whose members have ever studies Chiropractic. -James Compton DC president of the ACCA is quoted: (p. 10) Dr. McCash is a martyr to our cause. He has never been defeated. Defeat is only for those who will admit defeat. He knows that he is innocent of any wrong-doing and he refused to pay the fine imposed, but went to jail as a protest against the infamies which the State Medical Board undertakes to perpetrate in this state under the pretext that they are protecting the public. -notes efforts of PSC alumni in CA and students from CA to encourage positive vote for Chiropractic initiative on November 20, 1920 (p. 16) 1920 (May McCash DC of Berkeley dated 5/14/20, written in Oakland County Jail, entitled \"Why I am Now In Jail\" (p. 5) -full page ad (p. 16) from BJ says: ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE NO-FINE, GO- TO-JAIL CLUB 50 DAYS IN J AIL Miss Hazel E.

Tracy, D.C. serving time in the County Jail at Los Angeles\" 1920 (June): The Federation News [2(4)], \"Official Organ of the National Federation of Chiropractors\" with headquarters in Chicago, includes: -letter from Linden L.D. McCash, D.C., incarcerated in county jail in Oakland CA, bannered \"Our martyrs in California\" (p. 3): I am the Secretary of the Alameda County Chiropractors' Association whose Constitution and By-laws require, among other things, that its members, upon arrest, plead not guilty and demand a jury trial. Then, if convicted, the members are not permitted to pay a fine (75 per cent of which would go to the State M.D. Board to prosecute other Chiropractors with), or to accept probation, or to compromise in any way with the State M.D. Board or its representatives. Our members, if convicted, must serve the equivalent of all sentences in jail.I was arrested and let out on bonds Dec. 16, 1919. I went through various preliminaries until my jury trial, April 21 and 22, before Superior Judge Church, who for some reason showed unquestionable prejudice. My trial was by a professional jury and a deputy District Attorney, coached by the Attorney of the State M.D. Board. All present, including three visiting attorneys, said that there could be no other verdict than an acquittal on the evidence presented. Thus everybody thought up to the time the jury came in, after just fourteen minutes' deliberation. But I was convicted. My patients were not permitted to testify as to the benefits received from adjustings. I was sentenced April 23rd, 1920, to $200 fine, or the equivalent, 100 days in jail. The least the judge could have given me would have been $100 fine or fifty days in jail, the sentence he gave our true-blue fellow member, Hazel Harper, D.C., now serving her sentence in this jail. Immediately upon refusing to pay the fine (though I am losing $800 to $1500 monthly income from my office), I was taken to jail (2 P.M., April 23rd, 1920) and locked up in a cold iron cell in the dope fiends' wad. I had nothing till night to sit down on but a cold iron bed frame. There was an open, connecting, foul smelling toilet in my cell, and raving, moaning, screaming and crying of the dope fiends all about me; cold, horribly staring eyes looking in upon me; nothing to read; impossible to sleep; impossible to eat the jail fare; hell is too mild a word to describe what I went through until moved to a more agreeable environment the next day. I am no a full-fledged \"trusty,\" with the freedom of the corridors of the jail from 6:30 A.M. until 7:00 P.M., being under lock and key at all other times. The officers of the jail are perfect gentlemen and treat me as such. They have nothing to do with my arrest and conviction, and I have nothing but appreciation for the courtesies they have shown me. I have my suit case table here and am adjusting 18 to 25 every day, including four of my deputy sheriff jailers, and I am getting fine results.We have had much publicity (the one weapon the A.M.A. cannot withstand) in the papers, and my mail is not the least factor in creating publicity. I have, to date, received 1,773 letters and cards and 451 visitors. I have now been confined here 38 days and have not seen the sun during that time. Hazel Harper, D.C. (age 23), our member, was convicted on the same charge and by the same stool pigeon witnesses, and sentenced May 22nd, 1920. Everybody should write to her. She was accompanied to the jail and in by fifty friends. The sheriff made a nice talk suitable to the occasion, and I was permitted to join the bunch and present the victim of medical tyranny with a bouquet of roses, after which I was accorded the honor of carrying her suit case and accompanying her to the matron's apartment door. Neither Dr. Harper nor I regard our incarceration as a personal matter, but rather as mere incidental factors in OUR fight for Chiropractic emancipation. Therefore we have no hesitancy in asking every Chiropractor, his every patient and friend to write to each of us A CARD (or a letter) A DAY, TO BEAT THE A.M.A. Will everybody, to aid our publicity campaign, grant three minutes of their time each day to comply with this request? We are giving you all our time. Our slogan is: \"Go to jail for Chiropractic; beg, buy or steal publicity.\" Yours in jail Francisco, Cal., May 8, 1920. Dr. B.J. Palmer, Davenport, Iowa. Dear Doctor: As secretary of the above named society, permit me to express to you our thanks for your action in endorsing and acting on the suggestions of Dr. Murdock, to-wit: That all chiropractors write to their California friends and acquaintances urging their support the Chiropractic Bill to be voted upon next November. Such a statement as contained in the current issue of The Fountain Head News cannot fail to be of material assistance to us in our battle.We have just learned that the number of our bill on the ballot will be Number FIVE, and we would thank you to so announce in The Fountain Head News. Dr. LaBarre, a PSC graduate of this city, had his trial yesterday. The jury could not agree, so he will probably be tried again. The California Chiropractic College of this city dismissed its classes so that all of the students might attend the trial and lend their moral support to Dr. LaBarre. Again thanking you for the material assistance you are rendering us in our campaign. Chiropractically yours, Jos. A.

Recently he delivered lectures, for a whole year, on dietology and dietotherapy at the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic, of which he is the honorary dean. At the same college he started on Wednesday, July 7, a complete course of lectures on psychology and psychotherapy, covering the whole field of normal, abnormal, new, practical and subconscious psychology and the most scientific and up-to-date methods of mental healing. The public is admitted to these lectures. 1920 (Aug 7): FHN 6-7): Dear Doctor: Your kind letter of June 29th received. I am immensely delighted at your announcement that you will give a week's lectures in Los Angeles. I assure you that myself and all the faculty and students of the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic will do all in our power to make your meetings a success. We are especially pleased that you state that you will speak in favor of the Chiropractic Bill which we are working so hard to have passed in California. Your active support of the bill was the one thing needful to harmonize all the chiropractors of the State. Since you have come out openly in favor of the bill, the opposition has faded away practically to the vanishing point. Now that all the chiropractors are working in harmony, the campaign is moving forward with leaps and bounds. This work has been on my mind every minute for the last three years. I have put over $1500 into this movement, and will add more right along, and so I feel personally grateful to you for your active support. It comes just at a time when we need it most to go over the top.You have proven to us your bigness and your qualifications for being the National and International Leader in Chiropractic, by your ability to support a bill which is for the general good of all chiropractors, when you, yourself, hold mental reservations against one feature of the bill. In this world all legislation is the result of compromise and give and take. The California Bill is as near perfect as it is possible to get where so many factions had to be harmonized. The Bill was formulated in a State Convention, which was attended by more than 100 of the most active chiropractors in the State, including the leaders of every faction. Every debatable feature of the Bill was discussed at great length through three sessions of the convention, and the bill was adopted by a majority vote. The State Chiropractic Society was instructed to secure the adoption of the bill, and more than 500 members of the State Society are now working like Trojans to win, and it seems now that victory will come this time. The persecutions of the medical trust serve merely to urge us on to greater efforts for success.

The vote stands 75,903 for and 53,232 against the amendment. The purpose of the measure was to license the profession and establish a board of control in California. In Southern California the bill carried by a fair majority, but a heavy vote against the chiropractors in the northern counties swung the balance. Losing in Colorado Denver, Col., Nov. 5. - (Special.) - With 812 out of 1,483 precincts in the state of Colorado heard from, the vote on the Initiative petition to establish a board of control for and license the practice of Chiropractic stands 65,084 against and 44,070 forthe petition. The measure is undoubtedly defeated. Practically complete returns from the city of Denver show that the measure lost here by a large majority. ----- Three chiropractors were elected to state houses of representatives in the recent election, it was stated at the local college today. George Lauby of Akron, ., will go to the state house at Columbus with a majority of 10,000, while N.P. Ross of Fort Wayne, Ind., has been carried into office by a majority of 20,000. Dr. Elliott, who was elected to the Iowa house by 16,000, is the third member. All are Republicans. The fight for the licensing of the profession, it was stated by Dr. Palmer today, will be carried into Ohio, Indiana and Iowa legislatures at the next session. - (The Davenport Democrat and Leader, Nov. 5, 1920). 1920 (Sept): The Drugless Physician (1[9]:32), published by the American Association of United Drugless Physicians, headquartered at Spokane, Washington, publishes ad for: LOS ANGELES COLLEGE OF CHIROPRACTIC Dr. Charles A.

When I left Davenport and THE PSC, it was with the exalted notion that I was to be the pioneer Chiropractor of the whole Mexican republic, but it was not necessary to go any farther than San Antonio to have that notion dispelled, for there I learned through Dr. Gurden , president of the Texas Chiropractic College, that three of his graduates had already located in Mexican towns. The first, if I am not mistaken, was Dr. S. Voquero, a native of South America, who, a few months previous had opened an office in Monterey, in the state of Nuevo Leon, northern Mexico, and the report was that he hwas having noteworthy success.

The board was not impressed with this so-called high school and decided to conduct a thorough investigation. A citation was served on P. Purviance, and subpoenas were issued for a number of graduates of the school. At the hearing, it developed that there had been no regular classes in high school subjects... Purviance defended his action in the conduct of his high school on the ground that all the students in the high school werealso students in his Berkeley Chiropractic College, so he gave them the high school credits for subjects pursued int he regular chiropractic course. In regard to such credits, Will C. Wood, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, said: \"It would seem to me that not more than three units could honestly be countes as high school work. So many rumors of alleged irregularities in the conduct of the Berkeley Chiropractic College came to the attention of the board, that it was decided that this institution should also be investigated. The hearing was scheduled to begin October 1st. Purviance, who had made such a miserable showing with his high school, undertook to put a stop to the board's program. He was successful in getting a court order restraining the board from proceedin with the case, but before the papers were served the board secured a modification order and the hearing was called as per schedule. On October 3rd, adjournment was taken and all remaining witnesses were instructed to return on December 4th, when the hearing would resume. The case of the Berkeley Chiropractic College et al., vs. James Compton et al. is still pending in the courts. On June 1st, 1923, according to the records of the board, Percy Purviance made application for chiropractic licensure. In his personal affidavit he attested to the fact that he had matriculated in the Howard College of Chiropractic in Chicago, on the first day of June, 1918, and graduated on the 17th day of August, 1921, after having pursued a residence course of 2225 hours in this institution. In the school or college certificate, J.F. Allen Howard signed a statement giving Purviance credit for 2225 hours in the various subjects required in the Chiropractic Act. Purviance wrote the examination under Section 8, and on May 11th, 1925, was issued license Number 1318. Percy Purviance was cited to appear before the board at Sacramento on November 5th, and show cause why his license should not be revoked. The charge is fraud or deception in apply for licensure. The records of the Department of Educaiton of the State of California show that P. Purviance was a teacher in California high schools in the years 1918, 1919, 1920 and 1921.W.E. Purviance of Los Angeles, now enters the ring with the bluff and bluster characteristic of his kind. The first move of W.E. was to employ the Burns Detective Agency to send a detective to Sacramento and get copies of the applications for license of six chiropractors, two of whom were board members. We suppose he employed a detective to do this merely to impress the secretary of the board with the seriousness of the matter. He was so sure that these applications would reveal the discrepancies for which he was looking that he did not wait until he got the copies into his hands before he started to 'show up the board members.' He went to several members of the board and demanded that his brother by 'whitewashed.' He insisted that unless the charges against Percy Purviance were dismissed he would 'pull the lid off,' disgrace the board, put one or two of its members in jail and 'give chiropractic a black eye in California that would take ten years to live down.' If W.E. had waited until he received the copies of the applications for which he was paying the Burns Detective Agency to get for him, he would probably not have made such wild threats. The applications in question showed that Purviance was in error and his charges were without foundation. Not content with trying to intimidate the board members, Purviance went to the Governor of the Sate with his sordid tale of corruption... 1922 (Jan 22): Pasadena Chiropractic College founded on January 22 (see 6/17/60-LACC Registrar's Archives) in Pasadena by Weberg with $500 \"paid in capital\", continues until 1948 when name is changed by [Ruth B?] Drown to Drown College of Chiropractic; in 1949 becomes Helen Sanders DC's Hollywood Chiropractic College (HCC) (SRI, 1960, p. 215-6), also known as Hollywood College, School of Naturopathic Physicians & Surgeons (see 6/17/60-LACC Registrar's Archives) 1922 (pre-Nov): LACC's \"1922-1923 Announcement, Eleventh Year\"; at 931 South Hill St, LA (LACC, 1922-23/SFCR Archives); photos of faculty and administrators; photo of college community \"in front of the college on November 21, 1921\"; no change in administration since 1921-22 Announcement; faculty Psychology\" -John W.

Heidelberg is said to have been careless in the conferring of degrees once upon a time. However, his wrigings show a broad grasp of medical lore. He has done some more or less commendable work in the past (Spondylotherapy) which built up a following. Suddenly he comes out with this newer idea: that disease can be routed by sending into the body \"vibratory rates\" destructive to the \"rates of vibration\" of certain basic disease taints (old-fashioned homeopathy revived?) There are pople who swear they have beencured by this new method. There are others who say the same thing regarding \"Tanlac,\" bread-pills, and sugar and water. He has an eye for business, demanding cash in advance for all instructions and apparatus (the latter is leased at so much per month). Those physicians taking up the work are made to give their word they will not open up the box-like instruments said to furnish the health-giving currents of electricity. The patient usually shows a basic strain of either \"congenital,\" \"bovine\" or \"acquired\" syphillis, when his or her blood is examined or tested by the diagnostic device. Also it may show tuberculosis, cancer, tumor, streptococcus infection or gonorrhea. The patient is then \"treated\" by a machine having a metronome attachment and an electrode contacted with some part of the patient's body.

The subject was the necessity of raising the standards of chiropractic education, particularly the pre- chiropractic educational requirements. Some oppose this step. We shall try to believe that their motives are sincere. That the early pioneers in Chiropractic did not possess a high- school education or its equivalent is no argument to be applied to the present situation. As Dr Forster aptly states, in those days it was chiropractic that was subjected to a test. Because of its inherent merit, that method has won the public confidence to an extent that assures it a place in the healing art for all time. Now, however, it is not chiropractic but chiropractors who are under examination by the public. The fact that Chiropractic has won recognition in many states of the Union, instead of assuring it a protected future, as so many seem to assume, is, in fact, the greatest menace to its perpetuation. Herein Dr. B.J. Palmer concurs, for he has consistently displayed in his utterances and writings a note of doubt as to the ultimate value of legal recognition to chiropractic. However, we believe his reason for believing so is incorrect. He is against raising the pre-chiropractic educational requirements because he evidently fears it will cut down the output of chiropractors, thereby permitting the opposition to maintain an eternal numerical supremacy. We believe there are enough chiropractors in the country to safeguard the privileges so far won. A sufficient number of people are believers in chiropractic to help defend those rights. -\"In remembrance\" of Joseph J.

Cale got into some trouble as result of which he left the state, and the college in the hands of his wife, who outside of what little Chiropractic she got from association with her husband, is strictly an Osteopath. For many years most of their instructors were undergraduate Osteopathic students in a local college. Therefore, I do not consider that the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic is, or ever has been, in a position to teach Chiropractic. Consequently, the inferior character of Chiropractic practiced by its graduates. Another college in Los Angeles of some years existence is called the Eclectic College of Chiropractic. It has as its head a man who was originally an Osteopath and another member of its faculty is an M.D. who is also a graduate of some eastern Chiropractic school, I think the Mecca College in New Jersey. The remainder of its faculty are its own graduates. You may draw your own conclusions. Another school has been started here within the last year, under the name of the Golden State Chiropractic College. They are claiming for it, the Palmer system. However, they have among their faculty members some of the most notorious mixers in the State of California. Men whom I consider were traitors to Chiropractic because they accepted drugless practitioners' licenses under the medical board during the time we were fighting for Chiropractic's independence in California. At least such men deserted the cause in the time of its greatest need, and I can have no respect for deserters. Most of them, in my opinion, deserted because their sympathy was not with Chiropractic and they are only using it as a \"catch penny name\" to induce patients to their offices.... The group of Palmer men who are in this Golden State College have not conducted themselves as Palmer men should, inasmuch as they have affiliated themselves with the mixers and mixer organizations in California, instead of joining the known straights.1923 (Dec 4): according to unsigned letter of certification of hours for Herbert Ray Graham DC, Wilma Churchill DC, PhC has replaced Lulu B Wood DC as sec'y of the ECC; GA Fisk DC PhC is listed as field Course at the ECC: The following is the course of study presented at the Eclectic, the 'hour' being the classical forty-five minute period:- Subject Hours Anatomy atrics............................10 0 An additional study has recently been added in a special course in the Physiology of Digestion and Food Values.

Alvin Fisk DC authors \"Editorial Notes: The truth about chiropractic\"; notes that: The so-called 'straight\" or radical school assumes and declares that a normal transmission of nervous impulses to all the bodily tissues is a guarantee of health, the conservative school maintains that there are instances when a perfectly healthy body needs assistance because there are influences against which it is not wholly capable of successfully combatting, e.g., certain parasitic or traumatic factors. The radical school 'proves' its contention by deductive reasoning, the conservation school by inductive. Both schools are necessary for the fuller development of chiropractic. The radical school practitioner will often effect a seemingly miraculous cure because he recognizes no limitations to his science, whereas on the contrary he may often bring it into disrepute through making preposterous claims for it. The conservative practitioner will sometimes be loath to attempt to effect a cure and will send the patient away for a surgical operation when possibly none was necessary; yet he will in a number of instances undoubtedly prolong the life of the patient by such advice, e.g., in carcinoma, which though it has been cured through adjustments, yet more often it has not, and surgical extirpation of the growth usually guarantees at least life's prolongation even if not a complete cure.\" (p. 2) -notes Frank Pyott, PSC grad, is managing the x-ray department (p. 3) and has organized a technique department at the ECC (p. 4) -Charles H.

Dr. Cross and myself experimented for about eighteen months with various electrical modalities, with the idea of discovering some way to make a machine that would be useful to Chiropractors and we were able to use the high frequency apparatus as well as the sinusoidal current and accurately determine nerve pressures. The work that we were doing at that time was discontinued because we felt that the time was inopportune for the use of machines, as there was much opposition throughout the Chiropractic field against anything that could be considered 'mixing', and I, as a school man, could not afford to incur the ill-will of the Chiropractor in the field, who was so violently opposed to the use of anything that savored of diagnosis, and indeed, I am pleased the BJ came out for the Neuro-Calorimeter, as his position on this matter but opens up the way for a broader and more progressive Chiropractic. -Charles Wood reverses his previous position and advocates re-election of George Cryer as mayor of LA (p. 3; Wood, 1925b) -notes LACC graduation exercises on 2/6/25; Gordon M.

It is a machine made and used for the purpose of locating impingements of nerves any place in the human body. It Positively Proves the theory of nerve impingements due to subluxations of vertebra, and can demonstrate this conclusively, proving its capabilities by doing ork that no other machine can do, and further will convince by its power of detecting impinged nerves that the philosophy of Chiropractic is correct. MEASURES RESISTANCE The Diagnostic Vibro-meter is not a heat registering machine, but measures resistance of the nerve, or nerves that are impinged. It is an electrical machine and not a thermo-couple-galvanometer device and does not infringe in ANY way on ANY machine now on the market. It demonstrates that subluxations of the vertebra, impinging on nerves, alter the rates of vibrations of such nerves, thereby causing mal-function of certain organs and tissues. AMAZING FACTS The Diagnostic Vibro-meter proves that only an adjustment will remove the impingements and is the only machine now used for the purpose of spinal diagnosis that will definitely prove the above facts. The thermo-couple-galvanometer devices only record surface temperature and the readings from the patient's back canbe altered by massage along the spine; by use of the Thermo- Lamp, by hot packs, and the many electrical modalities. This is readily demonstrable to anyone who will investigate. PREVENTS MAL-ADJUSTMENT The Diagnosis Vibro-meter readings can be altered only by a real adjustment, and any other method of treatment applied to the spine will not alter the readings of the machine. It positively picks majors and eliminates the posibility of over-adjusting -- or mal- adjusting; thus increasing the efficiency of the Doctor. INVESTIGATE A comparison with all other machines used for a like purpose is welcomed by the manufacturers, and requests to demonstrate to any body of scientific men will be welcomed. Satisfy yourself. You are not asked to accept this machine until every claim we make for it has been absolutely proven. We will readily appreciate an opportunity to prove, beyond any question, that the Diagnostic Vibro-meter is the most accurate and reliable of any machine used for a like purpose.\" For information write or phone Dr. CH Wood, 918 W. 16th St., Los Angeles, Cal. 1925 (June): Bulletin of the ACA [2(5):15] carries ad for West Coast Chiropractic College, \"Affiliated with California Chiropractic College\"; WCCC is located at 426 29th St, Oakland; Herbert B.

The X-ray Laboratory, Chemical Laboratory, class rooms, stock rooms, and the main office were all on the first floor. In fact, it was built specifically to serve and fulfill the needs of a Chiropractic College as they then existed. Upon my graduation in 1929, I was invited to join the Faculty. That was the beginning of a long and happy association with our College. 1928: W.H. Pyott, D.C., LL.B. of Salt Lake City, publishes Eating for chemical balance (LACC Rare Books Collection) 1928 (Feb 1): application for enrollment in the \"regular\" 3600 hour DC/PhC program at LACC (at 920 Venice Blvd, LA) from Arthur Vitalis Nilsson, who lists 18 months of business school and his profession as gardener; enrollment contract specifies $750 tuition for the course (LACC Archives) 1928 (April): Uken Taniguchi graduates from LACC , as reported in National Chiropractic Journal 1940 (Dec); 9 (12):17 and the July, 1940 issue of the Chirogram 1928 (May 26): JAMA [90(21):1733-8] notes: LOS ANGELES COLLEGE OF CHIROPRACTIC (Inspected, Oct. 5, 1927) This school is located at 918 West Venice Boulevard (West Sixteenth Street). It began in December, 1924, with the amalgamation of three schools: the Golden State College ofChiropractic, the Eclectic College of Chiropractic, and a small, struggling Los Angeles chiropractic college conducted for years by Charles A. Cale but seemingly taken over by his wife, Linnie A. Cale, at the time of their separation; Linnie A. Cale is now dean of the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic, and Charles A. is running a school bearing his own name. Building. - The schools owns a three-story building, all of which it occupies. Space is ample, but the arrangement is poor. The roentgen-ray department is given the most conspicuous place, on the first floor. Dr. CH Wood, the president, has his private offices in the front rooms of the second floor; all of his equipment, however, is used by the school. The assembly hall is on the third floor. Equipment. - This is the best equipped chiropractic school that the inspector has seen. There were said to be forty new adjusting tables, and several of these were seen. There were said to be twenty therapeutic lights, four of which were of the large Fischer type. Four Morse wave generators were mentioned. There were patients in almost every booth, and to insist on seeing this apparatus would have been embarrassing. However, it is the policy of the president to sell all old apparatus about every two years and purchase new. He probably acts as advertising agent for the manufacturers and purchases at a very low cost. The statement is made that about $11,000 worth of new equipment has been purchased within the past ten months, and the statement may not be grossly exaggerated. A new $85 adjusting table was given as a premium to every new student enrolling this summer; this was done as a \"substitute for a cut in tuition,\" but such a measure, together with the rapid change of its physical therapy apparatus, makes the school an agency for the sale of equipment - an objectionable feature in spite of the fact that it provides better equipment for the use of the students. There were said to be eight microscopes. The chemistry laboratory was small and meagerly equipped. The school offers a 'course' in 'urinalysis.' Faculty. - There are eight teachers, one of whom (the dean) is an osteopath; the others claim only chiropractic education.Students. - The present enrollment is said to be 225. One hundred of these are in the night class. The graduates last year numbered ninety. The year before there were 115. Requirements. - The state law demands of chiropractors petitioning for examination a high school diploma or its equivalent. The state's field agent, to whom the inspector talked, asserts that Dr. Winters, who grants the qualifying certificates, is a graduate of the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic. It was learned in San Francisco that the students in the Berkeley Chiropractic College send applications not to San Francisco but to Los Angeles , because it is much easier to get qualifying certificates from Los Angeles. Course. - The time required for the day course is eighteen months and for the evening course is thirty-six months. The schedule includes 3,600 hours - probably forty-five minute periods. Of this time, 200 hours are said to be given to dissection, and 100 each to roentgen-ray and minor surgery. Obstetrics and pediatrics are also taught, but all courses are included under the name of chiropractic, this being an all-inclusive name in California. The tuition is $750 cash or $850 in time payments; this price includes at present an $85 adjusting table as a premium (Schools, 1928). 1928 (June 10-15): graduation exercises at LACC, detailed in July issue of The Chirogram (p. 4) 1928 (July): Bulletin of the ACA [5(4)] -1928 ACA convention program at Yellowstone Park includes: -\"Carver Technique of Adjusting and Address, Dr Willard Carver\" (p. 4) -\"Specific Adjustment for the Cranial Nerves. - Demonstration and Address, Dr Linnie A.

Wood announces \"Revival of the Chirogram\" (Wood, 1928, p. 2): For many months past The Chirogram has failed to go to the field, due largely to the fact that everyone connected with it was very busy....Dr. Leo B. Arnold, has been appointed by the Directors of the College to edit and publish the College Chirogram...Dr. Arnold has had very splendid training in Chemistry and Physics, and has been a member of the faculty of the College for some time. He has done research that will be of value to the profession and we feel that The Chirogram will solve a problem that now exists in the Chiropractic Field - the problem of researching many therapeutic ideas and methods that cannot be ordinarily researched by the practitioner. There is great need for such work being done, as most of the practitioners have to depend on outside agencies on many subjects, when we should have a bureau of research of our own that would give us information of Chiropractic origin and information particularly adapted to Chiropractic needs. The Chirogram again makes its bow to the Field with the hope that it may be of service to every Chiropractor. -notes also that Samuel J.

Cale DC and his article (p. 11): Patience and Progress We are proud of the progress that our grand profession has made. We have proven to the public that the adjustment of vertebrae is by far the most important thing to be done for sick people. We try to be patient with practitioners who use other methods. We know, deep down in our hearts, that what sick people need more than anything else is to have their vertebrae adjusted. Correct diet is necessary, and the proper mental attitude is certainly a great help, but such things will not free impinged nerves and allow them to carry the normal amount of vital impulse to the organs of the body. If one sits cross-legged for half an hour, the foot goes to sleep, because the nerve is pressed by the other knee. Now, so long as the legs are crossed, that foot will remain asleep, because the cause is still there. A foot that is asleep in that way will remain asleepso long as the cause continues to act. Massaging the foot won't help; changing the diet won't wake up the sleeping foot; applying electricity won't do it; taking medicine won't be of any benefit; applying hot and cold packs to bring more blood won't wake up the foot; putting colored lights over the foot won't accomplish anything; these methods are ridiculous in the face of the fact that the pressure cause is still there. The only thing that can awaken a foot that has gone to sleep because the legs are crossed is to uncross the legs and thereby remove the pressure from the nerve which supplies the foot. A liver that is sluggish is sluggish for the same reason that the foot was asleep, that is, because the nerve to the liver is pressed upon,and this pressure is at the point where the nerve to the liver passes between two vertebrae at the intervertebral foramen or opening in the spine. A vertebrae which slips a little out of its proper position gouges into a nerve and in a measure, puts that nerve to sleep. If that nerve happes to be the one which goes to the liver, then the liver is sluggish. A sluggish liver fails to make bile properly; it also fails to store sugar properly, and the person begins to feel ill, all because the liver is not receiving enough vital nerve force to enable it to carry on its work efficiently. The liver struggles on like an automobile that is missing on one cylinder. We have people trying to wake up such a torpid liver by means of colored lights, electricity, massage, pills, diet, etc., but so long as the nerve which supplies vitality to the liver is pressed upon by a vertebra, so long will the liver continue to remain torpid. The only necessary thing to awaken a sluggish liver is to remove the pressure from the nerve which carries the life force or vital power to the liver. This done, the liver is able to carry on its normal function of secreting bile and of storing sugar. And, as the old saying goes, \"Life is worth living. -\"Disabled American Veterans\" by SE Vanancy (pp. 13, 28) -\"Medicine vs. Physicians\" by Hugh B.

Every Chiropractor should give 100% support to Dr. Skeen's undertaking, as Dr. Skeen is certainly deserving of every support for venturing his savings in trying to equip and maintain a Hospital that would not only be a credit to Chiropractic, but to any school of practice. The rates at this institution are indeed reasonable and there is plenty of electrical and hydrotherapy equipment so that the practitioner can give his patient just what he wishes in these modalities. Dr. Skeen is very particular in his selection of nurses and dietitian, and the Chiropractic Physician who sends his patients to this hospital can be assured of obtaining for his patient, the proper dietary measures and such other hygenic measures as he may direct. -Ad for Dr. ER Blanchard's \"Blanchard Colonic Tables\" (p. 8) -CR Garvai is Field Secretary of the LACC (p. 12) 1928 (Sept): The California Chiropractor, edited by CH Davis and published by the Chiropractic Publishing Company at Pasadena CA, publishes: - a poem, \"Don't Quit,\" by KJ Weberg DC -C Russell Willet DC discusses merger of CCA and the Progressive Chiropractors Association of California in \"The Great Amalgamation\" (pp. 8, 31) -CJ Ennis reviews convention of the National Progressive Chiropractors Association at LACC during week of Monday, August 6, 1928 (pp. 10, 29) -\"Basic Science Act\" reprinted from AMA Bulletin (pp. 13, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30)-\"The Ear\" by Clyde F.

That said defendant filed an application for license to practice Chiropractic with the Board of Chiropractic Examiners of the State of California. At the time of filing said application, and for a considerable time prior thereto, said defendant had been a resident of the State of California. That by the terms of said application said defendant did not meet the minimum education requirement necessary to secure for himself a license to practice Chiropractic under the Chiropractic Act of the State of California. II. That said defendant secured a license to practice Chiropractic from the Nevada State Board of Chiropractic Examiners for the sole and single purpose of secruing a license by reciprocity from the Board of Chiropractic Examiners of the State of California. III. That in securing said license to practice Chiropractic within the State of Nevada, said defendant never met the same general requirements prescribed by the Chiropractic Act of the State of California. IV. That said defendant never furnished the Chiropractic Board of the State of California with an affidavit that he had been in active practice at least one year in the State of Nevada. V. That the written agreement of reciprocity between the Board of Chiropractic Examiners of the State of California and the Board of Chiropractic Examiners of the State of Nevada, dated August 1st, 1924, was never regularly entered into. VI.That the Chiropractic Act of the State of Nevada has never fixed the same general requirements for the issuance of licenses prescribed by the Chiropractic Act of the State of California. VII. That the sole purpose of defendant in securing a license to practice Chiropractic by reciprocity from the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners of the State of California was to avoid the necessity of meeting the general requirements of the Chiropractic Act of the State of California. VIII. That said defendant never regularly secured his license to practic Chiropractic from the Board of Chiropractic Examiners of the State of Nevada. CONCLUSION It is the conclusion of this Board from the foregoing that said defendant never qualified for the issuance of a license to practice Chiropractic within the State of California under Sections 5 or 9 of the Chiropractic Act of the State of California. ORDER The Board having made its Findings and Conclusion all as aforementioned, hereby revokes the license to practice Chiropractic of Hugh Benedict Logan and hereby cancels and terminates the same, and the Secretary is instructed to certify to the fact of revocation under the seal of the Board to the County Clerk of the counties in which the certificate of Hugh Benedict Logan, whose certificate has been revoked by this Order, is recorded.

Dr. Edwin Celestine Fortin, proprietor of the Associated Pathological and X-Ray Laboratories located in the Loew's State Bldg., in Los Angeles, was tried on the grounds of fraud and deception in apply for his California Chiropractic license, in that it was alleged that he had obtained his Chiropractic credentials from the Palmer School of Chiropractic fraudulently, by gaining advanced standing in the class work through representations that he was a Doctor of Osteopathy and a Doctor of Medicine. Evidence was introduced that there was a discrepancy in the statements of professional education sworn to in the application for licensure offered to the Medical Board in Colorado, the Osteopathic Board in California and the Chiropractic Board in California, and evidence showing Dr. Fortin's sworn statements of his professional education and his period of practice in California since his advent here in 1919... The Board met in an Executive session on January 24, and after reviewing the volumunous evidence introduced, decided to revoke the licenses of Drs.

Cale continues as president of SCCC (see LACC Registrar's FRAME-UP\" (p. 4): Dr. Charles Cale, former owner and president of the Los Angeles College of Chiropactic, but at present, owner and president of the Cale Chiropractic College, recently turned his college over to the profession, through the agency of members of the Tuesday Noon Chiropractic Luncheaon club, and it was freely predicted that it was to become a factor in Chiropractic affairs in southern California. Mr. Bert Humason, on the last day that he was to act as investigator for the California State Board of Chiropractic Examiners, as we were informed that he had been 'dismissed for cause', which was to be effective July 1st, in company withtwo investigators from the district attorney's office, cause the arrest of Dr. Cale, which seemed to call for a lot of very damaging publicity. It looked as if someone in the profession who had an interest in Dr. Cale's or his institution's elimination, probably had a publicity bureau employed, and made good use of it to build stories for publication that had very little truth in them, except the fact that Dr. Cale was arrested, and which has damaged every Chiropractor. Since the above mentioned publicity has appeared, nearly every practicing Chiropractor, especially in Los Angeles, has been confronted with a resulting raction of their patients, that proves that such publicity cannot be broadcasted, attacking one Chiropractor, without it having a decidedly unpleasant effect on all, because very few patients will be interested enought to determine to their complete satisfaction who does, and who does not, have an honestly earned diploma, and rather than devote verymuch time to such an investigation, they will discontinue their adjustments, or if they are contemplating tratment by a Chiropractor, they will just forget it. It is unfortunate that we cannot determine the exact amount of money and opportunity to help humanity that is lost to our profession forever through the medium of such inordinate, unnecessary and wholly vicious activities. Perhaps it seemed like a dangerous move to a 'rival school' which possibly caused it to take the most direct and detrimental course to protect personal and school interests, with little thought given to the interests of the 2400 practicing Chiropractors of California, who, day after day, by conscientious effort, are attempting to hold the profession and their practice where the public may appreciate them at their true value. Until the profession, as a whole, and the members individually forget their fear psychosis of demi-gods and unite in one association, and break the last vestage of control of these trouble makers, they can never expect to attain their rightful position in the professional world, much less maintain the comparatively meager one they now possess. We are informed that a 'rival school head' has been very busy calling everyone who will listen to him, and insisting that he had nothing to do with Dr. Cale's present plight, but, that is just what would be expected in any event, which reminds us that 'the guilty runneth away when no man pursueth.' Someone, who had something to do with the frame-up, made the monumental blunder of planting a bottle of whiskey in Dr. Cale's office, which proves that somebody did not know that Dr. Cale was a tee-totaler, and that he had not tasted any kind of an alcoholic beverage since he was seven years of age. The publicity alleged that Dr. Cale had sold diplomas. Strange as it may seem, the charges, when read in court, were only to the effect, that Dr. Cale had accepted $14.00 from a student, and had not issued such student a diploma. The investigator for the board, who, it is alleged, was the willing tool of a rival school, took Dr. Cale's wife aside and told her that Dr. Cale was planning on selling a lot of diplomas, andthen running away with another woman, but was promptly advised by Mrs. Cale that as long as they tried to frame Dr. Charles Cale, that she could not be tricked into turning against her husband by such absurd stories. Dr. T.F. Ratledge, president and owner of the Ratledge System of Chiropractic Schools, has twice publicly state, \"that he has known Dr. Cale for many years, and that he did not believe any such charges, either as to Dr. Cale having liquor in his possession, or selling diplomas. In conclusion, it seems, from the evidence so far adduced, that the case will fall of itw own inertia and properly take its place among recent absurd charges brought against a large number of well educated and conscientious Chiropractors who could not be dictated to, thereby incurring the ruthless disfavor of certain individuals. -\"IS THIS WHAT WE'RE COMING TO?\" (p. 4): (from the Los Angeles Illustrated Daily News) CHIROPRACTOR ACTS TO COMPEL PERMIT \"Launching a fight for the right of Chiropractors to practice in California without a knowledge of medical science, a petition for a writ of review was filed yesterday by H.B.

As emanated from Degnen's Radio-Active Solar Pad it affords a continual, beneficial 24-hour effect, being worn on the back by day and over the stomach at night. This element of continuity is responsible for a great part of the success of this pad. And it truly supplements your office treatments because being worn between visits to your office it helps the patient to respond more quickly to your corrective efforts. An increase in blood cells and their hemoglobin content is quickly noted, together with a prompt normalizing of blood pressure. There is a beneficial effect on the circulation, an enlivening of every part and organ of the system, which enables nature to perform its healing, eliminative, recuperative and rebuilding processes. In thirteen years we have sold over 150,000 of these pads, most of them to people who had tried other methods without success, and all on a trial basis providing for refund in full if satisfactory benefit is not received. Thousands of unsolicited testimonials tell of restored health. Our standard pad and the one which has in the main made this wonderful record sells for $27.50.

The second charge was dismissed, and in regard to the third charge upon which Dr. Cale was arrested about the 11th of December, he, Dr. Cale maintains that a lady applied to him for an examination to determine the nature of a prolapsis, and while Dr. Cale was making the necessary examination, officers for the present Board of Examiners made their way into Dr. Cale's office and charge him with a heinous, unmentionable offense, which Dr. Cale says is not true, 'as he assumed no posture or position other than that which any Doctor would have to assume to make such an examinationi.' It is wonderful how some officers can be present at certain times, when certain patients are having certain examinations, in certain Chiropractors' offices, but who seem to be deaf, dumb and blind to all irregularities which exist elsewhere. If the reports which come to the Bulletin are true, there is considerable cause for an investigator for the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners to employ his time to better advantage than to participate in school squabbles. 1930 (Apr): Chirogram (Vol. 6, No. 4) notes that: -Arthur V.

Wood, LACC president or Leo B. Arnold, Chirogram Editor, write the following: American Chiropractic Association: The American Chiropractic Association is giving chiropractic lectures over the National Broadcasting System every Tuesday evening. The lectures are of great value to our profession as they are educational and interesting. Chiropractors should inform their patients and friends of these radio talks and should encourage them to write to the station and thank them for their efforts toward the education of the public in a progressive science of healing. If every chiropractor will boost the ACA programs it cannot but help to popularize chiropractic in the interests of every practitioner. Tune in, doctor, on your radio every Tuesday evening for the ACA program. The American Chiropractic Association has representatives in California at the present time to encourage enrollments for memberships in their organization. The ACA is the largest national organization of chiropractors in existence today and is a good organization, controlled by chiropractors, for chiropractors, no individuals or schoolheads having any supervision over its policies, which are progressive and for the interest and welfare of our profession. That there is need of such organization as the ACA no sensible chiropractor can doubt, as we must have such an organization to assist our general welfare. Every chiropractor should be a member of a national organization. We have several functioning and no doubt each one is doing good work. One of which is the old UCA, which did such valiant work in the past that it is doubtful if chiropractic could have succeeded in many states in maintaining its position had it not been for this organization, as the UCA protected and defended our practitioners who were persecuted by the medical trust. While the writer has the greatest respect for the efforts being made by all the different national organizations, he feels it incumbent upon himself to favor the ACA over and above the other organizations, for the ACA has a more definite progressiveplan of organization, is more democratic, has the largest membership and is in a better position to further the progress of our profession. It is to the advantage of every chiropractor to become a member of the ACA and secure the malpractice protection and such other legal help as is given, and also to benefit by the ethical and moral standing that is very naturally the result of the policies of this great organization. Another feature of ACA membership is that one can belong to any other organization of Chiropractors and at the same time become a member in good standing in the ACA by adhering to its rules and regulations.

The buildings will be Class A structures and will consist of a three-story, fifty-six bed hospital that will be modern, up-to-date in every way and will be equipped with every type of electro and physiotherapy apparatus. Careful attention will be paid to dietary regimen and to the cooperation of the entire hospital staff with every doctor that may send patients into the institution. The chiropractic college building will be a three-story structure, sixty feet by one hundred sixty feet deep, and will have the most modern laboratories and biological equipment that can be secured. The entire top floor of the building will be devoted to an auditorium so that it may be used for large assembly purposes. A friend of chiropractic has offered to donate a large organ for the auditorium so that it may be used for large assembly purposes. All classrooms will be well lighted and ventilated and with tilted floors so that every student, no matter in which part of the room he may sit, may see and hear all work given by the instructor. There will be in addition to the two buildings just mentioned atwo-story buiilding which will be known as a Liberal Arts College, which will be devoted to the Pre-Chiropractic work that will be required of all students. The three buildings will be located on a twenty-acre tract, which will give the college a large campus and make it possible for the students to take part in school athletics. The site of the college is very scenic and healthful as it will be located in the beautiful San Fernando Valley, not far from the location of the United States Government Hospital which is devoted to the care of T.B. war veterans. The student body of the Los Angeles College are quite enthusiastic over the possibilities for the future of chiropractic and the college. The new college will be located one block from the street car line, and after July 1, 1930, this car line will maintain rapid transit service to the city, and it will be possible to make the trip in from the college to the depot at Fourth and Hill in ten minutes. It is also anticipated by the management of the college that radio programs will be given by remote control so that Chiropractic lectures may be given daily to the public. The officers and directors of the college feel grateful to those who have donated the land for our purpose, and to those who have signed pledges for endowments. At the present time there is a possibility of the endowment fund reaching the sum of $300,000 or more. In the next or succeeding issues of the Chirogram a list of names of all the donors will be given. It is expected that ground will be broken for the buildings within the next thirty days as the plans are nearly completed at this time, and the architects have stated that the buildings may be completed in from three to five months. A notice will be given the chiropractic field of the celebration of the breaking of the ground and an invitation will be extended to all to attend the ceremonies. The present school building on Venice Boulevard will be used for post-graduate work in physiotherapy, electrotherapy, X-Ray and laboratory work, and also for clinics and such class work that may be given in the city.

Graduation requirements will be raised from 2,400 hours to 3,000 hours. Steps will be taken to consolidate institutions in overlapping territories. Night schooling will be eliminated. Six out of the seven chiropractic colleges of California joined together in an agreement signed Saturday at a meeting at the Hotel Fresno. The compact formed the California Association of Chiropractic Schools and Colleges, the first organiztion of its kind ever attempted in the state. \"This is the greatest step which has ever been taken in chiropractic history,\" Dr. Fishback said. \"California is far ahead of any other state in the strictness of its regulation. The formation of this association will bring with it a raising of standards which will put the state ever farther ahead.\" The meeting was called by S.J. Howell of Sacramento. Dr. Fishback suggested the voluntary adoption of a higher requirement in the number of hours of study because of thedifficulty of amending the state law which requires only 2,600 hours.

The right of mass organizations to protec the good name of their profession, has been officially established in one of the most improtant and far reaching decisions ever handed down in courts of law. In the case of Bert Humason vs. the California Chiropractic Association, Drs. C. Russell Willett, George H. Stricker, H.M. Florence Reeve, K.T. Shea, J.J. Tanner, John W. Hurley, 50 John Does, 20 Jane Does, 2 John Doe Corporations and 2 JohnDoe Associations, the decision marks the line between malicious attack and privileged communication to members of a profession. The plaintiff asked damages in the amount of $60,000 actual general damages, $50,000 exemplary damages, the cost of suit incurred therein and for such other and further relief as the court deemed just and proper. The opinion rendered inthis case holds that public officials are a public target for criticism, if such criticism is published by citizens in good faith, and for such privileged publication, no recover can be hand under the California law of libel. This decision further held that while the articles were libelous on their face, Humason could not recover damages because he was a public official whose conduct was of general concern to the Chiropractic profession; their right to comment upon Humason's acts were held inviolate and that, even if false, they were privileged because they were publishe in the interest of protectionto the profession and consequently without malice. -photos of CW Hoffmann DC, JK Gilkerson DC, TF Ratledge DC, James Compton DC (p. 3) -photos of Clement J.

Editor CH Wood approves of SJ Howell's (CA Chiro Board Sec'y) successful efforts to kill these bills; also notes: The proposed naturopathic law had as its chief sponsors a few Chiropractors in Northern California, one of whom is conducting a so-called naturopathic school. If this naturopathic bill should be passed, it would undoubtedly make it possible for a great number of short-course practitioners to open up and practice legally. It would also make it possible for a few individuals who are interested in \"naturopathic institutions of learning\" to make a great deal of money through the promotion of doctors of all schools who they evidently expect would be compelled by the passage of this \"naturopathic\" act to obtain licensure thereunder if they wish to practice physiotherapeutic measures.

Failing in this and with the rank and file of their own little group of followers demanding the entrance of the Progressive Association into the one state organization the Board and CH Wood became very desperate in devising ways of accomplishing the defeat of Chiropractic organizations in California, and were the objects of severe but honest criticism which was printed and circulated to the field by the CCA. Any criticism of Humason was not in any way personal but a denunciation of his acts which were believed to be under direction of the Board and CH Wood . The criticism of the Board and CH Wood was based on the contents of certain letters, statements, and acts of various individuals which, all together, made it appear that a conspiracy existed to do great harm to former Board Members, to certain highly respected and educated individuals (Chiropractors), to certain really Chiropractic Associations and certain of the better Chiropractic Schools.

He has always been the fly in the ointment and the thorn in the flesh; he is, without doubt, unredeemable. My association with him in the past has caused me to be cautious of the present. I have done much for him, not because of my admirationfor him but because of that for which his school stands. Gladly would I welcome his elimination from that institution, were it possible to obtain means to place at the head of the school a man of sterling worth and character. Thatwould mean, first the expenditure of money in taking over the institution which under the supervision and direction of a capable man would develop into a creditable and honored institution. This change, sooner or later, must come about. Second, this would eliminate Wood from the field of activity in school work, and relegate him to the ranks of the profession, by whom he is not well liked. In your sojourning about the state it may be possible thyou would meet such a one who could assume the duties of the office of president and manager, who may have the means or know of someone who could furnish some to relieve the said Wood of his present duties. In that institution we have the nucleus of a Profession, and with the co-operation of a favorable Board much could be accomplished in raising the standards and elevating the Profession.

As it now exists it is said that when the board was recently canvassed as to the relative uniformity of the climates of California and Florida three members voted for Florida (which, of course, is unusual for a Californian).Sometime ago the International Chiropractic Congress saved Chiropractic in California, and, of course, now it is saved. Even that did not answer their present problem. It seems to us that if they had seven members on the Board, having four from one Ass'n and...No, that wouldn't work either. Suppose they had six members on the Board, three from each Ass'n. -then ask them problems and broadcast the arguments.

Watkins, D.C., Chairman NCA Committee on Educational Standards, 1935-36 NCA Board of Directors, 1942-43 1932 (Feb 20): CO Watkins' Montana Chirolite reports: At a meeting instigated by the California Association of Chiropractic Colleges, invitations were sent to the officers of the California State Board of Chiropractic Examiners, the Chiropractic Association of California, and the Progressive Chiropractic Association, to meet with them jointly in the Hotel Fresno, Fresno, Calif., November 28 and 29th, 1931, to create a better understanding and a more harmonious relationship between the above branches of the profession. This meeting met with the hearty endorsement of Col. Carlos W. Huntington, director of the Professional and Vocational Standards department of the state of California, who has been deeply interested in assisting the chiropractic profession in its endeavors to eliminate the differences of opinions which has divided this profession for the past number of years. According toCol. Huntington, the chiropractors' professional differences lie in the solution of the school problems and he firmly believes that if this angle can be overcome and the profession unified from an educational standpoint the other difficulties would soon be eliminated. This meeting was attended by representative of the School Association, the Progressive Chiropractic Association and of the state Board of Chiropractic Examiners, but unfortunately the Chiropractic Association of California were unable to attend. At this meeting an unexpected turn of affairs occurred which resulted in the unanimous vote of the assembly to advise ways and means whereby all chiropractic schools and colleges in this state would be owned by the profession and operated by a board of regents or governors based upon a plan of operation outlined and followed by the University of California or similar institutions. It is believed that this plan will have a far-reaching effect upon the whole profession throughout the entire country (p. 2) -Watkins reports: \"The case agains Dr LW Hosford, that has been pending for the last several months, was terminated in Judge Lazarus' court December 16, 1931, when the jury brought in a verdict of not guilty, after deliberating less than ten minutes\" (p. 4): Dr Hosford was charged by the state Medical Board of practicing surgery when he performed a tonsilectomy by electrical-coagulation.

So far, chiropractors, you have been specialists, spine specialists, just another kind of a specialist among so many others. Some of you are earnestly trying to limit yourself to just such a specialty. You don't fill the most crying need of the patient! He will come to you when he thinks his spine needs cracking, but he will pas you by when he needs a doctor!A doctor is something apart from a specialist, whatever his specialty may be. The need for a doctor, confidant, wise man, is an instinct bred into mankind; the need for spcialism is something specialists are trying to 'sell people,' and it goes against the grain. It is expensive, complicated, unsatisfactory and contrary to the lay mind. Therefore, let me suggest that chiropractors walk into this neglected field, that they prepare themselves to be family Doctors, that they strive to fulfill this urgent need in the hearts of the people. Drugless healing has all that is necessary for this field, common sense, dietetics, suntherapy, water cure, and constructive psychology - what more is needed? -LACC claims: \"We own our own buildings, clear of all incumbrances, an investment of over $110,000\"; new term will start 9/5/33; degrees conferred: DC, PhC, ND (p. 20) 1933 (Oct 28): Rangnar C.

F. James at San Jose, California. The action is a suit by the people of the state of California prompted by the Chiropractic League of California, restraining Drs. RC Steele and LB Steele, of Palo Alto, charging them with advertising and administering iridiagnosis, colon hygiene, electronics, diathermy, ultra-violet rays and galvanic currents in violation of the state law. The real purpose of the action is to secure a court interpretation of Sec. 7 of the California Chiropractic code, infavor of a 'straight' chiropractic technique. The Chiropractic Association of California, after filing an intervention, have been named cross-defendants and are waging the fight in favor of a liberal, progressive interpretation. The case has stirred to the depths the entire Chiropractic profession in California and the fight between the very small Chiropractic League and the general Chiropractic Association is truly a serious affair. Dr. Hickey will keep us informed of all proceedings and the outcome of this important decision. 1933 (Dec): The Chiropractic Journal (NCA) [1(12)] publishes: -Arthur T. Schwietert, D.C., member of NCA Board of Directors, authors \"The new deal - underlying facts and philosophical conclusions!\" (pp. 3, 26) -C.O.

The immediate cause of this widespread attention is the case instituted against two California chiropractors, Drs. Steele & Steele, of Palo Alto. Drs. Steele & Steele practice rational Chiropractic, which in the opinion of the majority of the profession they are entitled to practice under the statutes of the State of California which states that \"a license to practice Chiropractic shall authorize the holder thereof to practice Chiropractic in the State of California as taught in Chiropractic schools or colleges; and also to use all necessary mechanical, hygienic, and sanitary measures incident to the care of the body, but shall not authorize the practice of medicine, surgery, osteopathy, dentistry or optometry, nor the use of any drug or medicine now or hereafter included in materia medica.\" A few b.j. ites of limited practice, constituting the California Chiropractic League, assisted morally and financially by B.J. Palmer and the Chiropractic Health Bureau, instituted a suit against Drs. Steele & Steele in the attempt to force them to limit their practice to the adjustment of the twenty-four movablesegments of the spinal column - nothing more. The Chiropractic League secured the cooperation and assistance of five medical doctors as medical experts to testify against Drs. Steele & Steele. We will here record a few high-lights of the case so that the chiropractors of the Nation may judge for themselves as to whether or not the b.j. ites are justified in this action. - Editor. The case is one in which they are suing in injunction, seeking to enjoin Drs. Steele & Steele from using any drugless methods or physiotherapy in their Chiropractic practice. The case was tried during the early part of October in Department 3 of the Superior Court at San Jose, Santa Clara County, California, with Judge James presiding. The People (that is, the Chiropractic League, etc.) were represented by Maj. Leon French, Deputy Attorney General, and Mr. Frank Kington, Special Prosecutor. The request for leave to sue was made by the Chiropractic League, relator, and is a voluntary organization composed of about twenty-six Palmer graduates. The complaint charges in effect that Drs. Steele & Steele used physiotherapy while not holding a license to practice medicine and constitute a public nuisance and are dangerous and therefore a menace to public health and safety, and further states that everything else except the adjusting by hand of the vertebrae of the spinal column is medicine, and therefore Drs. Steele & Steele are practicing medicine without a license to do so. The People's case (Chiropractic League) was presented by the expert testimony of five medical doctors, in addition to Dr. Hender, M.D., Dean of the Palmer School; Dr. B.J. Palmer; several Palmer graduates; and Dr. Glen J. Sipes of San Francisco, intervenor. (Dr. Sipes and Dr. Swick, both of San Francisco, had intervened in this case and therefore were also defendants with Drs. Steele & Steele.) Witnesses for the defense were: Deposition of Dr. C.H. Wood of Los Angeles, President, Los Angeles College of Chiropractic; Drs. Blything and Koer, of Los Angeles; Dr. Ramy, of San Jose; Dr. C.O. Hunt, of Sacramento, Secretary California Board of Chiropractic Examiners; Dr. Willard Carver, President CarverChiropractic College, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and several others. All of these witnesses were chiropractors. The trial continued through two days with a night session October 9. About three hundred chiropractors attended the trial, packing the court room, with many of them standing through the two days and night sessions. All the medical experts testified that physiotherapy was a part of medicine and surgery as did both Drs. Hender and Palmer. Dr. Palmer stated that these methods in the hands of chiropractors were dangerous and a menace to public health. He also testified that he had instructed the Chiropractic Health Bureau to pay $500.00 toward instigating and prosecuting this case, and he admitted that he might profit should chiropractors be prohibited from using these methods complained of. He also testified that he did not like the California Chiropractic law because it provided for things other than Chiropractic. Dr. A.B. Hender, M.D., Dean of the Palmer School, testified that he had never had any instruction in physiotherapy and knew nothing about it. Two of the medical experts testified that they had never had any instruction in physiotherapy and knew nothing about it except that it was medicine and surgery. The third medical expert testified that he had never had any instruction in physiotherapy, but that he sent all such cases to a \"Mr.\" Smith and upon cross examination he testified that \"Mr.\" Smith was not a doctor at all and had no license of any kind. The fourth medical expert testified that he had received instruction in physiotherapy and used it in his practice, he being a specialist in orthopedic surgery; but on cross-examination he said there were was no difference between the poles of a galvanic current and that there were three kinds of Ultra-Violet Ray, all being generated by as many different kinds of instruments, and the only one he could think of was the cold Ultra-Violet. He said he knew there was a water-cooled Ultra-Violet generator, but he did not know its trade name or its manufacturer. Attorney Castellaw, defense counsel, then made the following statement: \"Your Honor, this witness absolutely does not qualify as an expert on physiotherapy. Why, he doesn't know thedifference between the poles of a galvanic current. Even I know that one of them is acid and the other is alkali. He doesn't know as much about the subject as I do, and I know nothing.\" The witness was finally excused, and the plaintiffs afterwards tried to put him back on the stand to fix up his previous testimony but the Judge ruled against it. The fifth medical expert was fairly informed on the subject. He had received instruction and upon cross-examination testified that he agreed with the A.M.A. Hand Book definition that physiotherapy was a treatment \"other than medicinal or mental,\" but stated that it became a part of medical practice when an M.D. used it in conjunction with medicine and surgery. He made a distinction between general medicine and medical practice. He admitted that there were many definitions of \"medicine,\" one of which included everything even Chiropractic, and the other was a strict definition known as \"internal medicine.\" The defense contended that all drugless, non-surgical physiotherapy and modalities were a part of Chiropractic practice, especially when they were used preparatory to or subsequent to the adjustment of subluxations, and all defense witnesses so testified. All of these witnesses stood up fine in cross- examinations. Dr. Willard Carver when on the stand was not asked any questions regarding physiotherapy, either upon direct or cross- examination, but his testimony was confined to the history and development of Chiropractic. He red at length from the only book every published by Dr. Daniel David Palmer, founder of Chiropractic, to the effect that Chiropractic included the adjustment of any or all of the three hundred or more articulations of the human body, and he also testified as to what was taught in the various Chiropractic colleges of which he had first-hand knowledge. The oral argument of the prosecution was to the effect that Chiropractic is the adjustment of the vertebrae of the spine only, and by hand only, and absolutely nothing else, and that nothing could be added to or taken away therefrom. Mr. Kington stated that the chiropractor hoped and expected his patients to be cleanwhen they came to his office, but that if they were not the chiropractor could not even legally prescribe a bath for them, nor could he prescribe nor even suggest a diet for them. He stated that everything else except the adjustment of the vertebrae was medicine and that no one could practice medicine without a license to do so. The defense argued that drugless and physiotherapy methods were not medicine within either the medical or the chiropractic Act, and that they could be used as a part of the chiropractor's practice, and that according to Section VII of the Chiropractic Act they had a legal right to use any and all mechanical, hygienic, and sanitary measures incident to the care of the body. At the close of the defense argument the Judge asked Mr. Stewart, defense attorney, \"Just where would you draw the line of demarcation between what the chiropractor might do and might not do?\" Mr. Stewart explained that it would, perhaps, be difficult for his Honor to draw this line, but he contended that the chiropractor had the legal right to use any and all drugless and non-surgical methods in his practice so long as he did not use drugs or internal medicine or practice surgery, which is the severing of tissues. Judge James then asked, \"Could he introduce a speculum to look down the patient's throat? Or could he in a case where the central portion of the prostate gland had compressed the neck of the bladder, introduce a speculum with an electric light on it to view the condition or even the bladder? Or even further, could he in a case of pyelitis introduce an instrument to view the ureter or even the kidney, all of this being drugless and no tissue being severed?\" Mr. Steward replied, \"I admit, your Honor, that you have some task before you to find this line of demarcation, but the introduction and use of diagnostic instruments is neither medicine nor surgery because no tissue had been severed, and other drugless measures are necessary in medication since an adjustment would not remove the prostatic obstruction.\" The Judge here interposed, \"Nor remove a fish bone from his throat.\" Mr. Steward replied, \"No, your Honor, it would not.\"Mr. Kington in his closing argument strenuously contended that all other methods or modalities were medicine or surgery and chiropractors were not qualified nor legally entitled to use them in a Chiropractic practice. Judge James then asked Mr. Kingston, \"suppose the patient became faint upon the chiropractor's table, what could he do in that case?\" Mr. Kingston replied, \"Well, there are just lots of things that a chiropractor might do and one of them would be to call a medical doctor.\" (There was much laughter at this point, even the Judge joining). Judge James then asked Mr. Kington, \"Could the chiropractor put on a hot pack?\" Reply, \"No, sir!\" \"Could he put a hot water bottle to the patient's feet if the patient became cold?\" Reply, \"No Sir! The chiropractor can do nothing except the adjusting of the vertebrae. All of these other things constitute the practice of medicine.\" After the close of the case, among other things the Judge remarked was, \"Unfortunately this is a case in which there can be no compromise - it must be either one thing or the other.\" Briefs will be filed and the time agreed upon was to be ten- twenty-ten. That is, the prosecution has ten days to file, the defense has twenty days after that, and the prosecution is then allowed ten days. That will make a total of forty days before the Judge takes the case upon advisement to render a decision. Judge James is a very able and capable judge and attorney, and was extremely fair in his rulings as a whole. Those of the defense rather feel that they have the best of the argument so far, but of course since it is strictly a matter of law it is a very difficult thing for even an attorney, much less a layman, to guess the outcome. However, the decision is awaited with interest because it is a question of momentous importance to the chiropractors of California and of the Nation. -W. Franklin Morris, D.C. of Oakland authors \"Quo vadis: The chiropractic legal pathway in California\" which discusses the Steele case in San Jose court (p. 24):The Chiropractic Health Bureau through its boss, Dr. B.J. Palmer, and the California Chiropractic League (about 20 b.j. ites) instituted a suite here in California, entitled, State of California and the California Chiropractic League, Relaters, versus Steele and Steele and with Dr. Glen J. Sipes, intervening on behalf of the defendant, at the insistence of B.J. Palmer, acting as an officer as he said, of the Chiropractic Health Bureau, and as such officer contributing to the cause filthy lucre to the amount of $500.00. What adds weight, of a convincing nature, to persistent rumor is the fact that the California branch of the A.M.A. has openly announced that it has definitely entered politics in the state. The section of the Chiropractic Law definitely involved in the action under discussion was Section 7 which is, in words and figures, following: \"One form of certificate shall be issued by the board of Chiropractic Examiners, which said certificate shall be designated \"license to practice Chiropractic,' which license shall authorize the holder thereof to practice Chiropractic in the state of California as taught in Chiropractic schools and colleges; and, also to use all necessary mechanical, and hygienic and sanitary measures incident to the care of the body, but shall not authorize the practice of medicine, surgery, osteopathy, dentistry or optometry, nor the use of any drug or medicine now or hereafter included in materia medica.\" It will be observed that the intention of the suit is to limit the construction of this defining clause, and to cause Chiropractic to be construed as being the adjusting of the movable 24 segments of the vertebral column to \"relieve pressure on nerves,\" and nothing else. Dr. Palmer, familiarly know as B.Jabus, took the stand and testified that Chiropractic consists of normal transmission of \"mental impulses\" through all intervertebral foramina, and that when this situation maintains, the organism must be well. This conclusion, B. Jabus maintains, is based upon the philosophy that disease cannot exist if an when mental impulses are normally transmitted through all intervertebral foramina.This was fine and might have worked some disadvantage to the defendants and intervenors, if it had not been for the fact they had procured the attendance of that world recognized author and savant of Chiropractic, Dr. Willard Carver, of Oklahoma City, who is now and for many years has been the longest time student of Chiropractic and succeeded to that title at the death, October 21, 1913 of Dr. Daniel David Palmer, the founder of that system and method. Dr. Carver testified that he knew and was familiar with the faculties of sixteen Chiropractic schools and colleges, and that they all taught as comprehensively as did the founder of Chiropractic, and then to show how liberal that was, read into the record ten definitions of Chiropractic from the one and only book written and published by Daniel David Palmer, each of which included the 300 or more articulations of the human skeletal frame. Dr. Carver further testified that he had seen the founder of Chiropractic, Dr. D.D. Palmer, adjust hip joints, shoulder joints, wrists, elbows, ankles, legs, feet, and toes, all for the purpose of removing impingement or interference from nerves and all as being Chiropractic. Judge James, who tried the case, and who seemed so eminently fair, and exhibited such perfect decorum as a presiding officer, was very much interested during the time Dr. Carver was on the stand, and frequently joined in the mirth which was provoked by what the San Jose News called Dr. Carver's \"dry, caustic humor.\" This is what the News, among other things said: \"A second blow was dealt the State when it was testified that Chiropracty isn't necessarily confined to the adjustment of the spinal column alone, but includes the adjustment of any or all of the more than three hundred bones composing the human anatomy. \"This was testified by Dr. Willard Carver, operator of a Chiropractic college in Oklahoma. \"Dr. Carver, in a dry, caustic form of humor, which swept the crowd of several hundred chiropractors in the courtroom intogales of laughter, read from a book written by Dr. D.D. Palmer, father of modern chiropracty, to prove his contention. \"At one point even the sober countenance of Judge James lost its judicial dignity when Dr. Carver, in a somber, dry tone of voice, enunciating each syllable carefully, read from the book that \"even corns and bunions are caused by dislocation of bones.\" At the close of the evidence it was the concensus of defendants and intervenors three lawyers, and those closely assisting in the trial, that B.J.'s testimony was most favorable to the opposite side, agreeing that his fault was that he \"put on too much Johnson,\" as the billiard phrase has it. It was felt that his ridiculously narrow conception was seriously against the interests of the Plaintiff's case. The Plaintiff at the close of oral argument asked leave to file written briefs and for ten days time in which to do so. The Court, of course, gave Defendants and the intervenor's lawyers ten days in which to file reply briefs, and after these are all in, the Court will take the necessary time to consider the whole case. It is thought a decision may be handed down in thirty to forty days from date of trial. The chiropractors of California feel quite encouraged with the general situation, for at the worst, if they should meet with an adverse decision, there will be time enough, pending appeal of the case, to initiate a bill which will do away with all practice acts and boards, and will license those now holding a valid license upon the same by paying a fee, and hereafter will only permit those to have license who are graduated from reputable schools or colleges, thus putting all branches of the so-called medical and drugless professions upon the same footing. \"Glory be!\" Welcome the day! 1933: CCP&S offers \"Physicians and Surgeons Post Graduate Course\": an \"advanced course in medicine and surgery extending over a period of two years open to graduate chiropractors, who desire to increase their knowledge of therapeutics\"; among the faculty were Gordon M.

Palmer has been widely noising it abroad that his institution and those acting with it, had attained a great victory in California. In the last issue of the Journal there appeared certain matters taken from a newspaper in San Jose, under the title of \"Chiropractic Fratricide\" which was addressed to the decision of Judge James of San Jose. As strange as one would think it, neither the remarks of B.J., nor those of the newspaper, contain anything approaching the actual truth and situation in California. I was at San Jose for the purpose of testifying expertly in the injunction suit against Roscoe C. Steele, et al. In the trial of the case B.J. Palmer was put upon the stand and permitted to testify as to his definition of Chiropractic in detail, and to testify that his idea was taught in the P.S.C.; and the defense didn't develop, on cross-examination, that he used modalities in that he used the X- ray apparatus and the Neurocalometer, he use of which he now calls the \"hole in one.\" The defense counsel, three lawyers of California, would not permit me to state on the witness stand, what Chiropractic consists of or in; and what has always been taught in Carver educational institution, and what is taught generally in the majority of the standard Chiropractic institutions in California, and elsewhere. The lawyers were afraid to do so because they had the fixed idea that in doing so I would shut out all phases of Physio- Therapy, notwithstanding, I told them that I could take care ofmyself upon that proposition, on cross-examination, and not do their record any injury. Had they permitted me to testify fully there would not have been the adverse dicta tat is discovered in Judge James' opinion. However, Judge James' dicta did not do the situation any damage. I feel sure that no matter what had been done, Judge James would have split the case precisely as he did, and I also think that his opinion discloses reversible error, for the language of the statute in that part of it directed to the subject matter of the action, is quite clear and expressive. However, why should the judge who is a politician get the entire medical profession on his back when his office is at stake, when he could split his decision and carry water on both shoulders without spilling a drop? It is perfectly clear, from a perusal of the opinion, that the court does not hold Chiropractic is, nor does not decide what schools each Chiropractic, and therefore does not decide what Chiropractic is in California. It only holds as follows: \"It is the court's opinion that the practice of modalities herein questioned is not included in those things which may be done or practiced under the authority of a license or certificate issued under the Chiropractic Act, and as now in effect. It follows from the views herein expressed that a decree be rendered for the plaintiff and against the defendants, and each of them, as prayed for, enjoining the defendants from the practice of the modalities in question; and it is accordingly so ordered.\" It clearly appears from the decision that the only victory won by B.J. Palmer was to have certain complimentary statements made about him in the dicta of the learned court, which dicta he forsook when he finally reached his decision. The writer does not know what the chiropractors of California have done, or intend to do with regard to the decision of the case, which should have been promptly appealed but for the fact that my evidence had been kept out and therefore the record was in questionable shape. However, with the record as it is there wasno doubt in my mind that the Supreme Court would reverse Judge James, and order a different decree. 1934 (May 29): TF Ratledge DC writes (Ratledge papers, Stockton Foundation for Chiropractic Research): Universal Chiropractic College, 121 Meyran Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Gentlemen:Attention: W.E. Hickman, Registrar. Replying to your favor of the 24th instant, beg to reply that Dr. Logan was for several years a practising chiropractor in this state, having come here from the state of Kansas. He is of a rather impetuous and aggressive nature and has made both enemies and friends in California. He did Aquarian Age teaching in association with Dr. Hurley for a while and then took up this work on his own responsibility, teaching as I understand it, what he himself developed. Dr. Logan is energetic and always active and seems to be the center usually of some turmoil in connection with his activities. He did some very splendid work in California for which the chiropractors in this state should be grateful. If he has done anything to injure chiropractic, it appears that it could only be due to inadvertance. His California license was revoked by a former board which in my opinion was purely an act of reprisal against him because they could not suppress him, which they wrongfully attempted to do. The fact of his losing his license in California should cast no reflection upon him. I know so little of his work that I am not in position to comment on its scientific merits. Concerning the use of the information given herein, will say that I have no desire to be drawn into any unpleasant controversy or in any way to offend Dr. Logan, for whom I hold no personal brief, one way or the other, except as based upon my observation of his activities in the state of California.1934 (July 31): RC Howe DC, sec'y of College of Naturopathic Physicians & Surgeons (CNP&S) and CCP&S, certifies hours for sec'y of CCP&S at 1609 West 9th St at Union Avenue, LA, certifies hours for Dr. Herbert W Sanson (LACC Registrar's Archives) 1934 (Nov 14): Sec'y for the LACC, Standard School,\" to BE Dyer (in my LACC from Cleveland papers, CCC/KC): Mr. B.E.

The California Medical Practice and Chiropractic Acts were called unconstitutional by the United States Naturopathic Association, Ltd., its officers and individual members.It listed headquarters at Phoenix, Ariz., and a branch at Hollywood and asked an injunction against the Chiropractic League of California, State Board of Examiners, and State officials to prevent them frorm \"arresting and otherwise interfereing with\" the naturopaths, who also are Chiropractors.

Schuman has made rapid strides in building up the college. Ably assisted by a board of directors, consisting of leading chiropractors representing the profession on the coast and a faculty second to none, the school has exceeded all expectations. Enrolling over forty new students since February 1st and with every indication that new student material will gross the one hundred mark before fall, the college is making plans for the greatest activity in the history of the organization. While Mr. Schuman has had previous experience in the public schools of Illinois, he has been fortunate in obtaining as Dean of the college, Dr. Wolfe Adler, a noted authority in school work, public lecturing and an unlimited knowledge of chiropractic. In line with the policy of the college a curriculum has been formulated involving 4000 hours as covered by the amendment now generally accepted by the profession. Special free classes arebeing offered to the field in various subjects and lectures usually accompanied by motion pictures are a special feature every other Thursday evening in the college at 9th and Union Sts., Los Angeles. Inasmuch as this is a field-owned, non-profit institution, let's get behind the Southern California College of Chiropractic and make it second to none in the entire country. -\"Chiropractic nurses and technicians\" by \"Elizabeth Langmo, Retiring State President\" (p. 19) -letter from F.

Hon. Saito, Chief of the Committee, announced that next in order was the representation requesting the enactment of a law governing the Art of Chiropractic and its practitioners. Hon. Fukazawa, a prime-mover of this Representation, rose to urge the authorities to recognize the scientific nature of the theory and practice of Chiropractic. The Official Gazette, No. 3963, of March 25, 1940, announced that the representation concerning Enactment of Law governing the Chiropractic practitioners was passed by the Diet as reported by chairman of the Relative Committee - Taken from the July, 1940 issue of the Chirogram. 1940: George Starr White, Ph.D., M.D. at 327-333 South Alvarado Street in LA, former \"honorary dean\" of the LACC(circa 1919-1923), authors and publishes Cosmo-electro Culture for Land and Man; includes photo of Dr. White and info re: reformed spelling movement; claims he has authored >100 books (LACC Rare Books Collection) PHOTOGRAPH 1940 graduating class at Southern California College of Chiropractic (see SCCC/1940) 1940: photo shows 15 graduates at SCCC (LACC Registrar's Archives); Lee H Norcross DC, ND becomes Director of Clinics; *Norman K Lovas DC and *Ralph J.

Crider, who succeeded? Watkins); notes Crider's premature 1939 rating of schools (Cleveland papers-CCC/KC) 1941 (Feb 19): letter to Wilma Churchill DC LACC from J.N. Firth of the Lincoln Chiropractic College, who writes to Wilma Churchill DC, sec'y of LACC, suggests Lincoln College's intention to meet NCA accreditation standards, but will continue to offer both three and four year courses (Ratledge papers, CCCKC; in my Lincoln College file): Dear Doctor: A copy of your letter of December 14th to Dr. Goodfellow has been received anc carefully read. The educational policy of the Lincoln Chiropractic College is to meet all legal requirements of the various states of the Union and the Provinces of Canada. Toward this end we teach a two, three and a four year course of nine months. Hereafter, however, it is our intention to teach only a three and a four year course and not issue a D.C. degree upon the completion of two years. The N.C.A. Code adopted at Dallas in 1939 states that effective September 1st, 1941, \"schools must conduct a course of four years of not less than 3600 hours to be divided into terms of eight months each.\" My interpretation of that paragraph is that aschool may conduct other courses in addition to the one here specified. At the present time it is possible to meet the legal requirements in six or eight states with a course of two years of nine months or three years of six months each. In order to prepare students to pass the basic science boards, we have found it necessary to teach a minimum course of three years. There are now nine or ten states which require four years of training. It is for these reasons that we intend to continue conducting a three and a four year course. In my opinion it would be suicide to make the minimum course four years of eight or nine months each at this time. However, colleges that are preparing students for all states of the Union should experience no hardship by including a fourth year in their curriculum. It is our intention to complete the N.C.A.'s questionnaire and be inspected by their committee on education. We believe all associations and the field in general have a right to know the type of school we conduct. They are then in better position to decide whether they want to continue supporting our institution or shift that support to some other institution. The course of action we would take if not approved would be within our rights as much as the course of action the N.C.A. has taken in establishing the requirements of its code. We would have two choices. First, be approved and conform to the N.C.A. code, or be unapproved and continue teaching the courses we now teach. It is quite evident the colleges will do that which is most profitable.

SHA W, D.C. 1942 (Aug 24): TF Ratledge writes to BJ Palmer, notes a chiro research challenge\" (p. 52): The Chiropractic Centennial occupies most of the reflections of members of the profession this year, but or much of the world the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II has also been an occasion for looking back. In that watershed year the profession was poised for a resurgence that it could not have anticipated: the war years had depleted the student populations - and faculties - of its schools, but legislation which was enacted in 1944 and in January 1945 became the basis of a revival of the schools similar to the period after World War I. The \"GI Bill\" paid for hundreds - perhaps a few thousand - returning veterans to gain a chiropractic education. The American Society of Military Chiropractors during the war years had published a \"Military Roll of Honor\" for those \"chirons\" who served as both officers and enlisted personnel, in all branches and in all theaters of conflict. Some of the data remains to be found: how many went into the services, how many received their DC through the GI Bill, how many \"GIs\" entered practice and how many made the final sacrifice. This page from the August 1942 Chirogram, the journal of the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic is a reminder of that sacrifice: Missing In Action In Midway Dr. R. William Stewart Word has reached us that Dr. Stewart is missing in action at sea. That makes us who knew him sad. \"Bill\" was a fine fellow, ever cheerful and helpful. His sunny disposition was a dominating characteristic of his personality. He enlisted in the Navy, October 1940, and was one of the first chiropractors to receive the rating of Ph.M. 2/C as a starting rank. At the time of his absence he was serving on the U.S.S. Yorktown.1942 (Sept 26): TF Ratledge DC writes to William Randolph Hearst, publisher of the Los Angeles Examiner; notes upcoming initiative Proposition #3 on California ballot in November is attempt by California Medical Association to kill chiropractic profession through basic science legislation (Ratledge papers- CCCKC Archives) 1942 (Nov 8): TF Ratledge is chairman of the Legislative Committee of the CCA, according to letter to Los Angeles Daily News this date (Ratledge papers- CCCKC Archive) 1942 (Dec 10): J. Gordon Anderson joins U.S.N.R. 1942: \"In the early part of 1940, the leaders of the Ace Club, the California Chiropractic Association and the State Association met and discussed the possibilities of amalgamating these three organizations which held within their ranks the greatest strength in the profession. Many longs hours of discussion culminated in the organization of what is now known as the California Chiropractic Association. At a joint meeting of the officials of these three organizations in Fresno in 1942, the California Chiropractic Association was born\" (Stump, 1947) 1942: Gevitz (1988) notes: A spectacular and ultimately critical battle over the establishment of a basic science board occurred in California in 1942. Fifteen years earlier, George Kress, MD, editor of California & Western Medicine, wrote a series of favorable editorials about the concept of preliminary qualifying examinations. Kress ultimately led the long campaign to have his state added to the basic science board column. Both the osteopaths and the chiropractors had achieved much legal protection for themselves in California. In 1921, each movement gathered sufficient voter signatures to have initiative measures placed on the state ballot calling for the creation of separate, independent examining boards. Each passed by large margins andgave each group complete autonomy over its own affairs. These laws virtually insulated the two movements from any restrictive measures which the legislature might undertake in the future to interfere with or change the process by which these practitioners were licensed, since laws passed through the initiative could only be directly altered by the voters through other initiatives. Both osteopathy and chiropractic thrived in California. The DO's had won the right to the same scope of license privileges as had the MD's, the College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons (COP&S) was far and away the best equipped school in the profession, and the County of Los Angeles in the late 1920s built a separate 200-bed hospital for the DO's, which became the chief clinical training center for COP&S students. Osteopathic graduates from other schools came in large numbers to the state, to the point where 10% to 15% of the people of California relied upon DO's for primary medical care. The chiropractors also won considerable acceptance from the public, and in 1927 the state was the home of ten chiropractic schools. In 1931, of 5910 registered health practitioners in Los Angeles County, 806 (13.6%) were DO's and 1,272 (21.5%) were chiropractors. These figures gave the regular medical society little satisfaction. Throughout the 1930s the state medical society considered a number of ways by which a basic science board might be established and what form it should take....finally in 1942 the society levied a special assessment on their membership and gathered sufficient signatures to place the measure before the voters. The chiropractors waged a particularly tough and at times dirty campaign. As in other states, the threat of a basic science board helped to push the various warring factions of the movement together. In a clearly illegal action, the secretary of the Board of Chiropractic Examiners, a state agency, sent out a letter on official stationery to all licensees in the Bay area \"requesting them to attend an authorized meeting of all San Francisco and San Mateo County Chiropractors\" to organize political activity against the basic science board measure, ominously warning that \"a complete list of every Chiropractor in this area will be in the hands of theBoard Chairman, and a list [will be] made of all absentees,\" clearly implying that one's license might be in jeopardy for not participating. While the California Medical Society raised $50,000 for the campaign, the chiropractors generated twice as much. In the weeks before the vote, the chiropractors published huge numbers of anti-initiative flyers, sent out hundreds of thousands of postcards to their patients and others informing them of the threat to their practice, took out hundreds of inches of newspaper advertisements, and blanketed the state with 5,000 spot announcements on radio. Their main theme, as ever, was therapeutic freedom, which they combined with a local target - Ray Lyman Wilbur, MD, Chancellor of Stanford University, former president of the AMA, and them chairman of its Council on Medical Education and Hospitals. The chiropractors declared that Wilbur wanted to be \"the medical dictator\" of California. Immediately before the election, the Chiropractic Board had the attorney-general's office swear out warrants for two individuals who had allegedly notarized batches of the basic science initiative petitions without checking individual signatures. The widely publicized arrests helped to cast doubt on and to question the integrity of those sponsoring the measure. The medical society was outflanked and unable to respond adequately to the sensational charges and arguments put forward by their opponents. Furthermore, the issue, as most voters saw it, and as the chiropractors wished them to see it, was whether health professions had the right to set their own standards and whether patients had the right to pick the type of doctor they wanted. When the vote was in, the basic science initiative lost, 972,641 to 507,421, a margin of almost two to one. As for the future possibility of a basic science board for California, editor Kress, in his review of the vote, correctly predicted that given the size of the margin it was very unlikely that the issue would be raised again and sadly concluded 'Requiescat in Pace.' 1942: Ralph J. Martin (1986) writes:In 1942 the CMA launched an initiative bill to put DCs out of business by requiring all health licentiates to take the same Basic Science Board. It was a good idea, but the bill was written in such a way that the examiners could know which profession the applicants for examination are expected to practice in. This made it possible to find ways to flunk all chiropractic applicants. This infuriated all DCs throughout the whole state, and a statewide organization was formed to fight the measure. Dr. Dan Nash was appointed State Campaign Director, and it soon became obvious that he was having difficulties. Dr. Henry Higley and I met with him, and worked out a plan for him to leave Southern California to us while he covered the rest of the state. We had full support of all the schools of the state, and I put half a dozen telephones in my office, and had women students from the schools staff them and call the doctors of the South soliciting funds to support the campaign. As soon as a doctor would agree to make a donation, the girls would tell them that a student would be right out to their office to pick it up. We mailed out blazers of information about the importance of the campaign and news of progress. The support was wonderful, and after four weeks the campaign was red-hot. The election inf November was a smashing victory for chiropractic, and we won by the greatest majority ever logged in a Primary Election up to that time in California. From that time on for over a decade chiropractic clout in Sacramento was a historic phenomena, and the following year the DCs on a wave of enthusiasm formed the new CCA. I was a charter member, and our 1922 Initiative Law was our banner of unity. Dr. Duane Smith was the first president of the CCA. 1942: SRI (1960, pp. 29-30) notes: In the year 1942 a common ground of opposition to enactment of a California basic science law resulted in a truce on debate and dissension within the profession and led three chiropractic groups with divergent interests to present a solid front in the fight which defeated the proposed legislation. These groups were the California Chiropractic Association (CCA), the AffiliatedClub, and the Ace Club. The CCA, with less than 100 members, was an affiliate of the International Chiropractors Association, a world-wide organization of \"straight\" practitioners. The Affiliated Club, started in about 1933 and having some 1,200 members, was the state-wide affiliate of the National Chiropractic Association, a nation-wide organization of \"mixer\" practitioners. The Ace Club, organized in about 1939, was a fraternal type of organization of approximately 1,000 members, serving as a vehicle for chiropractic social activities ....In the following year these ranks were split by internal dissension and a particular group of practitioners withdrew from the CCA and formed its own independent association, the American Chiropractic Association (ACA). There were two primary reasons for this split: (1) that which has been referred to as the BJ Palmer \"puppet\" administration of the CCA and (2) the tendency for certain influential elements of the CCA to swing toward a \"mixer\" philosophy. In 1948 the CCA and the ACA attempted to reconcile their differences, but this effort proved fruitless and the ACA continues as the established association of 'straights' 1942: Chirogram indicates 36 LACC students serving in armed forces (LACC, 1986) 1942: AC Johnson DC, ND, DNT publishes Postural Correction in LA (Smallie, 1990); see also 1939; Johnson will be a regular contributor to the Chirogram in the 1940s 1942: Joe Shelby Riley MD, DO, DC authors 12th edition of Zone Reflex, published by Mrs TS Riley at 2418 Mayfield AVE, Montrose CA; Dr Riley credits Dr William Fitzgerald of Hartford CT as discoverer of Zone Therapy, shows picture of JS Riley using concussor [file in Instrument Adjusting folder; volume in Palmer/West Archives] PHOTOGRAPHSCCC graduating class of 1942 (from my in LACC photos folder; ND, PhC, is new Director of Clinics; faculty are: -Lee H.

As an organization, we must make these announcements, but, either Dr. Nugent or the Committee on Education should have written the provisionally approved schools immediately followingthe Convention, setting forth what changes they would have to make to get full approval. I took this up with Dr. Cregger, a couple of weeks ago, since he is a member of the Committee and he agreed to contact Dr. Crider and get some action. We will have to expect complaints. I have had several meetings here on the school question and am making progress. However, have not gotten far enough to make any announcement but hope, that in a couple or three months, to have a good report. Went to Oakland for a two day meeting last week-end. There was a good turn-out and I think, well worth the effort. I takes a lot of my time attending meetings - a week ago, it was seven nights straight and two full days. The report Dr. Rogers received from the Bureau of Standards in Washington indicates that we will have to find a laboratory and set-up a committee or council to handle the investigations ourselves. Dr. Murphy's findings indicate the same thing. It will be advisable to get an estimated cost for checking these various items, then set up the program where those applying for approval can be charged a fee commensurate with the cost. This, when worked out and put into operation is going to meet with enthusiastic support from the field.

Incidentally, as you may recall, we sent you some students who were transferred to California. About two years ago, one of our instructors, Dr. Francis I. Regardie, enlisted in the armed forces. Because of his health, and other conditions, he was recently discharged, and he is desirous of going to California, where he holds a license to practice. He is now 37 yuears of age, in the prime of life, an excellent speaker and writer, and formerly an instructor in anatomy in our school. If you can use his services in any way, please write me at your earliest convenience so that he will not have to make a contact with any other school.With best personal wishes, I remain, Sincerely yours,... FED/fir 1944 (June 24): letter from TF Ratledge to Frank E. Dean DC of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic at 261 W. 71st St. in NYC (Ratledge papers, CCCKC Archives): Dear Doctor Dean: Yours of June 20th. at hand and glad to hear from you. Also, thank you for the kindliness expressed in your letter. I recall something about some students who were formerly in your institution either enrolling here or at least talking about it, however, I do not remember details about them. I recall that a Mr. Richards from some school in N.Y. did start in to finish his course but when the war came on he discontinued the work. I believe that he was a native of Germany and perhaps had not completed citizenship in the U.S.A. At present I have no opening for additional instructor but, if Dr. Regardie does come out, have him get in touch with me and it might be that things would have changed by that time. Nothing is very certain these hectic days. I trust that your institution does not commit itself to the \"Baruch\" scheme to steal chiropractic by a failing medical click or in support of the bill now in congress which would place chiropractors in a service situation where they would be subject to medical control through the surgeon general's office. Either proposal is dangeraous and it is unfortunate that anyone, posing as representing the profession, should betray chiropractic by attempting to commit chiropractic to medicine or as any part of it. If Dr. Regardie ever expects to establish a practice there is no better opportunity than now in California. All the chiropractors are doing well, making money as they never did before. The only thing is, many of them are so anxious to make money that they sort of conduct a \"drugless department store\" office and let the patient decide what he needs instead of the Doctor making such decision and more and more people complain that they cannot getan adjustment any more. \"The chiropractors do everything else but give an adjustment\". I cannot understand why so many chiropractors have so little imagination that they cannot determine that the proper practice of chiropractic requires doing all of the things necessary in the complete application of the chiorpractic principles which are universally applicable in human health problems. With every good wish, I am, Very truly yours, 1944 (July 26): NCA Council of Past Executives votes to sponsor the Chiropractic Research Foundation (CRF; today's FCER); Gordon M. Goodfellow DC of California chairman of the board of the NCA, presents Articles and Bylaws for the Chiropractic Research Foundation to NCA Council of Past Executives (former Gavel Club); Goodfellow is one of the incorporators; on July 27 articles of incorporation are notarized in Cook County IL, and filed with the Secretary of State in Delaware (Schierholz, 1986, p. 3) 1944 -Robert O McClintock DC, \"President and Dean, California Chiropractic College, Oakland, California\" authors \"The neurological aspect of acute anterior poliomyelitis\" (pp. (Aug): National Chiropractic Journal (14[8]) includes: -Francis Regardie DC, a graduate of the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic and later faculty at LACC, member of ASMC, recounts his experience in the service in article, \"The status of chiropractic in the army\" (pp. 19-22, 48-); notes his disgruntlement with the army's assignments involving many menial tasks, private chiropractic care for selected officers and their wives, ultimately advances totechnical sergeant in charge of paperwork, repeatedly rejected for Officers Training presumably because of chiropractic background; notes: On April 28, 1942, I enlisted for service in the Army. Immediately of course there were the shots and injections, of which the least said the better - save that I began adjusting my fellow soldiers at basic training camp more or less immediately, to alleviate the distressing gastric symptoms and cephalalgia which were the direct sequelae to typhoid-paratyphoic injections. My assignment was to be the medical department for basic training at Camp ____. Apart from regular basic military subjects, the curriculum included litter-drill, the rudiments of first aid, anatomy and physiology - with all of whcih the average well-informed chiropractor is familiar... And I have written this report, not out of personal rancour and dissatisfaction with my two year army career - though of course this is present and active - but primarily to expose as thoroughly as possible the utter hypocrisy and stupidity of the army attitude. So long as medical men are in authority, never will the chiropractor be given the opportunity to prove what he can do for the alleviation of sickness and suffering. The conclusion remains that we must fight, with determiantion and adamant purpose, primarily to educate the public to the absolute necessity of chiropractic, and by these means force the conservative, complacent and reactionary authorities to adopt an entirely different and rational attitude toward our skill. These past two years in the Army have proved utterly useless, bot to me as an individual, as well as to the Army itself. Registered in my mind remains indelibly but one thing - a vindictive impulse to fight this incompetence wherever encountered with every ounce of energy at my disposal, both as a writer and as a speaker. Prior to my enlistment I was one of those unfortunate chiropractors who was content with his own practice, but who left it to the other fellow to do the political and oratorical haranguing. I realized the necessity of cooperation with others with similar ideals, but.....! Today, my inner attitude has changed. For I propose working with the NCA wholeheartedly, as well aswith the State Society in whatever State I happen to function, to aid them in every possible way to whip up chiropractic opinion and power to the requisite pitch, so that this present unholy and unrighteous condition of things may be eliminated from this democratic nation of ours. 1944 (Aug): The Chirogram [11(4)] includes: (pp. 12): \"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.\" The Chiropractic profession has been becoming increasingly conscious of the need for unity. This has been exemplified by the nerger of the associations of California into the present harmonious California Chiropractic Association. For the past year the though has been milling around in the minds of the Chiropractors of California, and gradually gaining momentum, that there should be an amalgamation of the schools in the North, and of the schools in the South. The ultimate outcome of which would be one big, progressive institution of learning and research for each end of the State. In any amalgamation there must be some few who will take the \"bull by the horns,\" undertake the preliminary steps, and lay the groundwork to bring about the materialization of the original idea. Therefore, knowing that it was in the interest of Chiropractic and the wish of the profession that such a move be made, Dr. George H. Haynes and Dr. Henry G. Higley, principal stockholders of the Southern California College of Chiropractic, and I have laid such necessary groundwork. Due to lack of time, it has been necessary that a great deal of the preliminary planning be already completed before consulting many in the profession. However, a few of the more active doctors, Drs. Goodfellow, Eacrett, Montenegro, etc., have been told of the plans. The curriculi of the two schools have been carefully scrutinized and it has been found that the students of both schools can be carried through the remainder of their courses with practically no rearrangement of classes, and no delay of the timeof graduation. In fact the students will profit by the increased faculty and the combined efforts and facilities of the two schools. The Southern California College of Chiropractic and the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic have both, in the past, been at a loss to properly accomodate those in the profession who have sought to obtain post graduate instruction. It is part of the plan of the amalgamation to make available to the members of the profession a post-graduate course separate and distinct from the under-graduate school. The graduate course will be a progressive one and will afford an opportunity for research and development of new phases of diagnosis and treatment. While the final arrangements have not been completed, it was felt that the amalgamation would not be endangered by giving out this advance information. Those who are earnestly interested in doing that which is for the best interests of the profession cannot help but support such a program. It has been gratifying to find such a unanimity of thought and desire for the advancement of Chiropractic as manifested by them up to now, complete lack of criticism of opposition to this worthwhile movement. The ultimate goal is, of course, that the Chiropractic institutions shall be owned by the State Association. And it is to this end that everyone is working. It is only a matter of time before the Association will be in a position to consummate such plans. 1944 (Aug 28): Wolf Adler DC, Dean of SCCC, writes \"to whom it may concern\" to ask for extra gas ration for student Della (LACC Registrar's Archives) 1944 Delbert J.

Dear Doctor Churchill: I have read with much interest the comments of Dr. Metzinger on my research questionnair. I trust you will be fair enough to print this brief reply. Far from admitting prejudice, my reference to the Carver concept was actually the statement of an open mind on the subject. Any other attitude at the present state of our knowledge would really have been prejudice. Dr. Metzinger seems to misunderstand the whole purpose of the questionnaire. It was not to settle anything by a vote of opinion, but rather to define and limit the area in which research is necessary. As for terminology, such terms as anterior, posterior, superior, inferior and so forth have but one standardized meaning in human anatomy, though the zoologists and comparative anatomists sometimes favor using the term anterior to mean headward, because they are thinking of animals that go on all fours, but we are not in the habit of considerating human structure from that point of view.

Nugent, Director of Education for the National Chiropractic Association, was present, and announced to the doctors present that he had come to California to amalgamate the Chiropractic Colleges of the state into one professionally owned non-profit college. I had a long talk with him after the meeting, and assured him that, as president of the Southern California College and of the Metropolitan District, he could count on my full cooperation. Dr Nugent immediately began negotiations with Dr Wilma Churchill, owner of LACC, and it soon developed that she refused to sell to the So. California College, so we began setting up a new holding non-profit corporation, the California Chiropractic Educational Foundation. During the latter half of 1946 I spent a great deal of time with attorney CP Von Herzen and Dr Nugent putting this corporation into functioning condition with myself as chairman of the new Board of Regents. As we went into the new year of 1947 all was ready, and funds for the purchase had been raised from the profession through the CRF, and we put $25,000 into escrow for a total purchase price of $225,000 for LACC. The escrow closed on May 7, 1947 after a stormy session with Dr Churchill the day before, as she now had misgivings about selling her school which had nearly 1,000 students enrolled. She refused to negotiate with Dr Nugent, knowing he was a very persuasive negotiator. He assured her that this was no problem, that I, Dr. Martin, Dr John Koer, and Dr Sidney Milbank would meet with her in his place. This we did, and after a couple of stormy hours we came out with the school, and the next day took possession. It has operated ever since under theownership of the California Chiropractic Educational Foundation. 1946: LACC graduation photo indicates 72 graduate (including 14 females); stable administration (Wood, Koer, Churchill, Cale); faculty Kirby (grad class advisor) -Dr. Leland P.

To the many pre-arranged meetings held throughout the length and breadth of California have come hundreds of members of our profession to hear the educational aims and objects of the NCA, as revealed by its Educational Director, Dr. John J. Nugent, New Haven, Conn. Having arrived in this state just five weeks ago, his message of chiropractic education has already been heard all over the state. Public school teachers, city, county and state officials int he department of education have already heard his message and though they came primarily to scoff and chide many stayed to congratulate and encourage this educator who represents us even in this Nation's Capitol. As the days pass the trying work of presenting this great program in advanced chiropractic education continues to grow greater and the stress is now beginning to show. But Dr. Nugent is happy; happy because he has found not only appreciative audiences to whom he addressed his messages but healso found the \"response\" from his audience that has been so greatly needed in this state. If the NCA will permit Dr. Nugent sufficient time in California we feel this great mission, so newly launched, will attain to mature growth and secure entrenchment. Due to a grave heart disorder, Dr. J. Ralph John has had to give up his work as State Chairman of the Chiropractic Research Foundation . In acknowledging the letter of recognition from Dr. John, our state president, Dr. I.A. Dundas, expressed warm appreciation for the ability shown by Dr. John in his initial organiztion of the 24 districts in this state. With regrets the board of directors accepted the recognition and offered a resolution of thanks and appreciation to the man known to us so dearly as J. Ralph. The CRF has been one of the major subjects of Dr. Nugent's many talks out here and in all of them he has praised highly the work done by the John's committee in behalf of the CRF, and most highly has he offered his praise to its fine and able leader, Dr. John. - Reported by E.H.

He gave them the old 'rush-act'. He was on his way to the National Convention and wanted to make a report to the convention to the effect that taking over the two Northern schools was now a reality. In contacting Dr McClintock first, he made a sad mistake in revealing hisunderhand methods, by relating to Dr McClintock how he had not been up and above-board in his dealings with Dr Churchill, holding out twenty-five thousand and telling her that he didn't have it for her when he had it all the while playing a hold-out game. And so Dr McClintock reasoned out that if he would do that with Dr Churchill, he could also do it with Dr McClintock. Nugent wanted to do business with Mac separately and use freeze-out tactics on Mrs Russell. Mac wouldn't go for it, so Nugent had to go to Mrs Russell. Mrs R gave him the old stall and so now poor Dr Nugent has to go to the National convention without the big news that Dr Nugent has been victorious in California. Perhaps you are right that eventually these dishonest dealings are detected by the people and the man hangs himself, -- for in addition to the above obstacles to the \"Nugent plan\", Dr Nugent has now gained animosity from State Board Secretary Percy, as a result of the recent attempt of Dr Nugent to direct Dr Percy as to what text books must be used. I admire your travelling to Sacramento and speaking up, on your own behalf, against the Nugent-CCA steam-roller, but in addition I would like to see some cooperative effort, on the part of those Chiropractors who know the true facts, in an attempt to inform the Chiropractors of the State who are in ignorance of 'what cooks' and are only hearing and being influenced by one side of the picture. I regret that Dr Sherwood did not even have the courtesy to answer my recent letter. Minor instances such as this are the influencing factors which lead Chiropractors such as myself to join organizations like the ACA, with the purpose of arousing action. Sincerely, Paul\" P.S. - My addrress during the month of August will be: c/o Dr LJ Smallie, 125 South J Street, MADERA, (Aug 4): according to Chirogram 1974 (Nov); 41(11): 11-14:In August, 1947, the Council on Education was officially created by the Committee on Educational Standards and the National Council of Educational Institutions. It was officially approved by the House of Delegates of the National Chiropractic Association on August 4, 1947. The following represented the colleges: Doctors Joseph Janse, Jack Wolfe, HC Harring, Hendricks, CW Weiant, R Mueller, PA Parr and Homer Beatty. Doctors EH Garner, T Boner, J Wood, J Schnick and John Nugent, Director of Education, represented the Committee. From its inception until 1970 the Council on Education operated as an autonomous council of the (NCA) American Chiropractic Association. In 1970 the Council on Chiropractic Education was incorporated as an autonomous body and the American Chiropractic Association and the Federation of Chiropractic Examiners approved sponsorship of the Council. The International Chiropractors' Association (ICA) gracefully declined to sponsor the CCE, though a place for them has been kept open. 1947 (Sept 9): Harold A. Houde DC, ND graduated from the LACC in 1922 and subsequently serve as instructor in pathology (probably at SCCC?); in 1937 \"he became co- owner of the California College of Natural Healing Arts (CCNHA); 9/9/47 became Chief of Staff of the Clinic at LACC (In Memoriam, 1958) 1947 (Oct): National Chiropractic Journal [17(10):8-9] includes photo of leaders of the CRF meeting with Leo Spears, D.C. during August 22-23, 1947; Spears had offered to provide his hospital as a research center for the CRF; depicted are Neal Bishop, F.

(LACC, 1971) 1947: according to Nilsson (1975): At that time [1929] the College was privately owned as were all Chiropractic schools in those early years, and the practitioners had too little time to spare toward professional organization. As the years passed the enrollment of new students increased, until after World War II, it was necessary to add a sprawling one-story building to accomodate the heavy post-war enrollments. By then, the practitioners out in the field had organized into a growing group which became known as the California Chiropractic Association. Among the members of this organization, a smaller group was formed, which, on behalf of leading Chiropractors, purchased the College from its principal owner, the late Dr. Wilma Churchill. She placed a very strong emphasis on academic qualities although because of economical necessities, she had to accept students with only a High School diploma (or the equivalent). The period of those years between 1948 and 1952were especially rewarding because of the physical and academic transformation the College was subjected to. Everybody was busy, schedules were reorganized, subjects were revised and improved, and a system of audio-visual methods were added to adid in the teaching procedures. How did all of us react to this change? Did it upset our former routines? No, indeed! It was exciting, interesting, gratifying! It was as if our College was undergoing growing pains. And then came Glendale! It was quite a change to leave the smaller class rooms as they were on Venice Boulevard and Ninth and Union Streets in Los Angeles to move up to the beautiful premises on Broadway in Glendale. No one complained. All of us were thrilled and happy! 1948: \"Dr RO McClintock took over the reins as Dean and President of the California Chiropractic College in 1928\" according to Chiro-Pulse 1948 Yearbook of the CCC; photos of all faculty administration include: -Robert Osborne McClintock DC, PhC, MC, theory & practice, neurology, osteology, pathology, physical diagnosis) -Ethel G.

He pointed out that of the forty-six states recognizing the practice of chiropractic, thirty-two states require four years of education for licensure; that of the remainder, ten states have basic science, medical or mixed examining boards whose examinations are of such a character as to require four years of education to qualify. The remaining four states, he warned, may quite likely raise their requirements while these students are still in school.Dr Nugent urged all students, particularly GI students, now enrolled in courses of less than four years to carefully consider the tragic predicament they may find themselves in later on when they attempt to qualify for licensure. He cited many incidents of disillusioned and embittered GI's, graduates of short courses, wandering from state to state futilely trying to obtain a license to practice. A vocational pamphlet giving information on state requirements can be obtained by writing the National Chiropractic Association, National Bldg, Webster City IA 1948 (Nov): ICA International Review of Chiropractic [3(5): 2] notes: CALIFORNIA CASE CLOSED... 400 Hour Rule Sustained The case of Hunt et al. vs. Board of Chiropractic Examiners has finally been closed with a court ruling adverse to the plaintiffs' contentions. The case was commenced in 1946 to test the validity of Board Rule 17 which increased requirements from 2400 hours to 4000 hours, and provided that candidates have 50 per cent vision and hearing, and no major physical defects. The trial court held in plaintiffs' favor on the ground that the Chiropractic Board was an administrative body, and had no power to amend the express terms of the initiative act of 1922. On August 4, 1948, the District Court of Appeals (First Appellate Division - Division Two) rendered an opinion reversing the trial court stating that \"It is settled law that when a statute imposes upon an administrative body discretion to act under certain circumstances mandate will not lie to compel the exercise of such discretion in a particular manner.\" Plaintiffs requested review of the case before the Supreme Court of California. The petition of plaintiffs was denied in a recent order issued by the Supreme Court. This has the effect of sustaining the opinion of the District Court of Appeal. Thus, Rule 17 is sustained, and hereafter all applicants for licensure must have 4000 hours, 90 per cent attendance. Certainmodifications may be forthcoming if Proposition No. 16 passes at the general election in November. 1948: Ruth B.

Martin, D.C., N.D., president of LACC, to Elizabeth Eckardt, D.C. (in my Martin file): Dr. Elizabeth Eckardt 516 Ogden Canyon Ogden, Utah Dear Dr. Eckardt: We are very much interested in your report on the Utah basic science struggle. Much thought has been given to your letter by the administrative committee of the college, but we find ourselvesunable to participate in any action until you furnish us with more information in the form of a copy of each of your bills Nos. 135 and 145. We are not in a position to oppose 'basic science' just because it is basic science for this would arouse public antagonism to our profession and do us all much damage. In 1942 we fought the basic science bill because it was unfair and discriminatory, giving control of the chiropractic profession to the medical profession. Thus we were careful to make the distinction that we were not fighting basic science as such but rather the particular objectionable basic science bill which was being offered. If medical doctors are going to sit on the board and no chiropractors, then you have a just basis of objection which the public will be interested in of course. Some of us may have to be in Nevada in a few day son a political situation there which affects the college and if you feel we could help you while there by coming on into Utah please let me know right away. Also copies of your bills, so we can see just what you are up against.

Merton, associated with him.He is the past president of the Los Angeles District Associaton (1935), California Chiropractic Association (1936), NCA State Delegate (1937-1944), Vice-President of the NCA (1946-1947), and Trustee of the CRF since 1948. He has also served for several years as a member of the NCA Committee on Radio Publicity. He has been active in civic and fraternal affairs, serving as District Officer of the Lions International for two years and as District Chairman for four years. He is a veteran of World War I, and a member of the American Legion Post No. 715. Dr. Cregger has always been in the forefront of all progressive movements in the profession and provided an enviable leadership for the NCA during his terms of office. He sponsored the NCA Key Member Club at Toronto in 1946, was elected president at Omaha in 1947, and has served efficiently since that time. The NCA Key Membership Club is one of the most exclusive organizations in the NCA, since membership is limited to those who have enrolled three or more new members in one year. Its membership now comprises nearly 100 members, all of whom have rendered yeoman service to the NCA. His most charming and capable wife, Peggy, has indeed been a helpmate to him, having served as President of the National Women's Chiropractic Auxiliary (1944-1946), and being still active in the councils of the organization. We acknowledge, with grateful appreciation, the outstanding example of service to the NCA that 'Dr. Floyd' and his wife, Peggy, have given unstintingly to the organization and the profession generally. May his enviable record inspire others to a life of service, which brings its own satisfaction and rewards.

I had put in a tremendous amount of effort to secure non-profit status for the Foundation and the school, and as elected President of the LACC, I no longer had a vote on the Board of Regents of the Foundation. When the regents agreed in the purchase of the property, to pay Cecil DeMille's taxes, I resigned as president in protest. I was immediately thereafter appointed to the Committee on Accreditation of the Council on Chiropractic Education of the National Chiropractic Association, in which capacity I served for nine years until 1960. This position involved meeting twice a year with the Council on Education, and evaluating the schools we had visited, and providing accreditation recognition as our standards were met.

There never has been and there is no connection between these irregular movements not originating within organized professional channels that purported to create a physicians and surgeons license. The college has not nor will it initiate or participate in any political activity to change the chiropractic law prior to an official endorsement of such a movement by the California Chiropractic Association. Political discussions involving these controversial subjects were ruled out of order in our class rooms and on our campus many months ago. It is the policy of the college that political issues involving questions of changing the scope of practice must be decided by the licensed men in the field and the state association and have no place in the college, distracting students from the pursuit of their courses. The purpose of this college is to fulfill the educational needs of our profession and we have striven to hold solely to that purpose and shall continue with that policy. - Ralph J.

Decision came in a ruling by which the court refused to order Mrs. Josephine DePonzi Doren, residing at Seattle, Wash., to pay the Credit Bureau of San Jose $123.40 for a course of treatments she had received between Feb. 7 and Sept. 8, 1947, from Dr. John W. Wehringer, 1715 The Alameda. The credit bureau was assigned the account for collection. The court said during the seven-month interval, Mrs. Doren made seventy-eight visits to Dr. Wehringer's office, seeking a cure for headaches. On seven visits she received manual adjustments of her spinal column, on eight visits was sold concentrated foods, Dr. Wehringer prescribed, and on other occasions was given radionic treatments. These consisted, the court said, of \"high frequency radio waves to produce a stimulating or relaxing effect\" on her body. Evidence showed, the court declared. Dr. Wehringer's total bill was $284.98 plus a $36.75 charge for the concentrated foods. She paid $195, and then stopped payments. Value of the seven manual spinal adjustments she received, the court stated, was far less than the $195. Radionic treatments are not chiropractic treatments,\" the court held, \"and the defendant is not obliged to pay for them.\"Mrs. Doren was represented by Bruce L. Griswold, attorney at law. Decision overruled a contrary finding by Justice John Dempsey. 1951 (Oct 10): letter on Ratledge College stationery from Carl S. Cleveland, Sr., D.C. to Vinton F. Logan, D.C. (in my Ratlege files): Dear Dr. Logan: California requires only 120 hours of Physiotherapy and no Minor Surgery. We teach the 120 hours of physiotherapy strictly to meet the laws' requirement and no more. This cycles over an 8 months period every 28 months. In other words, we do not teach physiotherapy for a period of 20 months out of each 28 months. We are teaching physiotherapy daily for the rest of this semester, approximately 40 hours remaining. Then, we do not plan giving any physiotherapy for 20 months. You have fine men and we would like to accommodate you. But, naturally we are minimizing physiotherapy and do not want to emphasize it more than actually necessary. Dr. Carl told me that he had agreed to play the recording for you some time when you were in Kansas City. There are many influences, as you know, out here working to destroy Chiropractic. We are working closely with Palmer and Ratledge Graduates. If you feel that we could be of service to you, Chiropractic, and your graduates here in an organization way, please advise us accordingly as we will be glad to work with you and with them. If you have any suggestions, feel free to advise us. With kindest regards to you and your Institution, I am Very sincerely yours,... CSC/an 1951 (Oct): Loy SH Baird, LLB, MSc, DC, ND, former professor public health and jurisprudence at LACC (see 1947) relocates from Tucson AZ to Redlands CA according to news item in the Journal of the American NaturopathicPhysicians & Surgeons Association (JANA) WORTHLESS Promotion of \"radio\" machines for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and every other serious disease was the most bizarre violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act tried in the Federal courts in September, the Food and Drug Administration stated October 17th. Ruth B. Drown, Los Angeles chiropractor, was found guilty by a jury. Judge Harry C. Westover will pronounce sentence October 19. Dr. Drown claimed that her machines can \"tune in\" the organs of the body with a single drop of the patient's blood, or two drops if the patient can't be there in person. This remote control is effective even when the operator does not know the patient's whereabouts, according to the Drown teachings At the 2-week jury trial in Los Angeles, one defense witness, a long-time patient of Dr. Drown's, said she had been treated successfully from Los Angeles when she contracted pneumonia at Atlantic City, N.J. She said she believed she would be healed even if she had an automobile accident in Moscow and the Drown machine had to tune in through the Iron Curtain. FDA said the promoter claimed in leaflets and circulars that the only current used is that of \"the patient's own body energy of life force.\" By tuning in on the radio frequency of the disease, according to Dr. Drown, the diseased cells automatically fall away. Her followers are careful to preserve their \"body magnetism.\" At the trial one gave enthusiastic endorsement to the Drown admonition against shower baths. He explained taht water is a conductor which would connect the patient with the vibrations of the sewer. The trial had its tragic side, FDA reported. The Government's key case history was that of a woman treated for cancer of the breast by the Drown Radio Therapeutic Instrument until her case became too advanced for successful surgery.Government experts prominent in the fields of medical and chiropractic treatment, radio, and physics testified at the trial that the machines were worthless. - News Release - Federal Security Agency, Food and Drug Administration, Washington, D.C. 1951 (Dec 28): letter from Paul O. Parr, D.C., president of Carver Chiropractic College, on college stationery; this will lead to the formation of the NAACSC (in my Carver files): TO ALL CHIROPRACTIC SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES ON THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT: After considerable discussion with the heads of other schools at the last several State Association meetings and much correspondence in the last sixty days, it seems to have fallen my lot to extend to you an invitation to attend a meeting, the date for which is tentatively set as March 8, 1952, the location for which is tentatively set for Chicago, since it is centrally located and has excellent transportation possibilities. The purpose of this meeting is the discussion of school problems by school men. You are cordially invited to be represented by any or all bona fide representatives of your school. We urge that you be represented by at least one of your clear- thinking, forward-looking authorities. In recent correspondence with deans and presidents of chiropractic colleges I have made many suggestions as to possibilities of organization of schools, etc. I had thought at first that I would include in this invitation a proposed outline for a school organization. I had even thought of stating my position as to having another accrediting association, but I have been advised by the president of one of the chiropractic colleges that this might be taken on the part of some of you as meaning that decisions have been made, when they have not. Should like to quote three sentences from this great educator's letter to me: \"I feel the only thing that is needed is an invitation to the schools to attend a called meeting, which would contain a designated place and time to consider mutual problems for the benefit of all. At the conclusion of such a meeting an association of chiropractic schools and colleges might beformed if that was the consensus of opinion of those in attendance. By this I mean that any action that might be taken and the nature of any association that might be formed would entirely depend upon those attending the meeting.\" It is a little difficult for me to inculcate in this letter the urgency I feel without discussing some of the problems of endangering the proposition by giving the impression that conclusions have already been formed. So, again let me invite you and even strongly urge you that in the interest of unity and advancement of our profession and toward the goal of better health services for our people, please, let us once get the brains of the school business into a close-harmony meeting.

WESTERN STATES COLLEGE, 4525 S.E. OF CHARGES Dr. L.S.H. Baird, Redlands, Calif., consultant, was acquitted of all charges of mail fraud after trial in the federal court in Tucson, Ariz., the subject matter of which was his radionic analysis service to the profession. The government's case was presented by a post office inspector and physician for the Federal Food and Drug Administration and involved switched and duplicate blood specimens submitted in the name of a fictitious \"Dr. W.F. Callas, Washington, D.C.\" Two local medical men also testified. The defense was quickly able to show that neither the specimens were properly prepared nor the case histories correctly reported despite the usual instructions. Moreover, it developed in the testimony of the government witnesses that they were completely unable to interpret Dr. Baird's reports, again in spite of an available paper on the subject. An able defense was made by local counsel, John F. Molloy, Esq., or Dr. Baird who was formerly public relations chairman of the Tucson County Naturopathic Physicians' Society and earlier was professor of public health and jurisprudence at the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic. Key defense witnesses were Dr. Robert T. Lustig, Grand Rapids, Mich., osteopathic physician and surgeon and instructor in atomic medicine, and Mr. Thomas G.

McClintock, D.C., President of the California Chiropractic College at 370 43rd St, Oakland 9, California (Cleveland papers, CCC/KC): Dear Dr. McClintock: I had upon my return correspondence from you dated February 29th. I am very glad to hear from you regarding your favorable sentiments toward our deliberations. You will no doubt be happy to hear that we formed the North American Association of Chiropractic Schools and Colleges, the press release for which is herewith enclosed for your information. I should like to personally, as a member, and officially, as President of the new Association, invite you to write me a letter applying to be considered for membership. I personally assure you that we are not forming for the purpose of combat, debate or argument with any other organization, but only to further those points upon which we agree for the mutual advancement of our profession and our institutions, and urge you to join us in these laudable endeavors. I feel quite sure that if you submit a letter of request to be considered a member, we can circulate the request among the members and obtain full consent of membership. I am sure it will enthuse those of us who are already members to have you join us and I feel quite sure that your counsel and advice would be of great aid to us. It is altogether possible that this strength, prestige and support can be of considerable moral and material aid to us. Sorry to hear of the illness of your Secretary and more deeply sorry that your institution could not be represented at the conference. There were other institutions that were similarlyprevented from attending that we have hopes will associate themselves as I am inviting you to do. Sincerely,... 1952 (Apr 1): letter on Carver College stationery from Paul O. Parr, D.C., president, at 521 Northwest Ninth St., Oklahoma City (Cleveland papers, CCC/KC, attached to Carl Jr.'s letter to Vinton Logan dated 6/20/52): TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF CHIROPRACTIC SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES: I would like to draw your attention to the following items: (1)I have not heard from most of you regarding the date I suggested in my last letter for the next meeting. This should be attended to as soon as possible so the date can be set and the reservations made at the hotel. (2)The North American Assocaition of Chiropractic Schools and Colleges has been chartered under the laws of Oklahoma as a non-profit corporation for educational and scientific purposes. Work is going forward int he office of the Secretary to have copyright processes on the name. (3)I have had brought to my attention by one of the member schools an application blank for listing in the College Blue JBook. It is suggested by this school that you note that the International Chiropractors Association and the North American Association of Chiropractic Schools and Colleges have not been listed in the key to abbreviations to be used. It has been suggested that an asterisk be put in this column on the form and that other appropriate material be substituted at the bottom. Example: International Chiropractors Association and/or member of North American Association of Chiropractic Schools and Colleges. It is suggested that a listing in the Blue Book would be of some prestige and will no doubt serve to introduce to them the fact that we have a North American Association of Chiropractic Schools and Colleges. An application blank will be enclosed so that you may use it if you so desire.(4)Correspondence has been received from the International Chiropractic College, Inc., Dayton, Ohio and from Dr. McClintock from California. These two institutions have been written letters inviting them to join with us in the Association. It is believed at the present time that they will avail themselves of this invitation. 1952-1955: Leonard J.

Thomas, D.C., dean 1957 (May): ICA International Review of Chiropractic [11 (11): 6-12] publishes \"Naturopathic scandals threaten chiropractic!\" including section on \"California\": Anyone acquainted with chiropractic knows, of course, that California is a focal spot for naturopaths, quasi-physicians, and a host of assorted technique peddlers and gadget users. A continual battle has been waged between the chiropractors on one hand and so-called liberals on the other. While naturopathy was formerly recognized, now it is not. With no place to go, many of them acquired chiropractic licenses without acquiring any knowledge, respect or use for chiropractic. Naturopathic and other irregular practices were purveyed to the public as chiropractic. The idea that chiorpractors should practice minor surgery gets its impetus in California, metastasis and implants itself in other states as well. As a matter of fact, just a few years ago there was a proposal that, with a few extra hours of instruction, chiropractors become full-fledged physicians and surgeons. Notwithstanding the fact that the California courts have consistently held chiropractic to be restricted to the adjustment of the articulations of the spine, the naturopathic element has contended that chiropractors could practice anything taught in a chiropractic school or college. These ideas are held by a majority of the present Board of Chiropractic Examiners - as evidenced by the latest official opinion on scope of practice issued December 8, 1956: 'The adjusting of subluxation and luxation of all structures of the body including soft tissues;'The use of physiotherapy as now known including galvanic and sinusoidal currents, electronics, ultrasound, long and short wave diathermy apparatus, infra-red rays, ultra-violet, heliotherapy, etc.; 'The use of hydrotherapy including colon therapy, etc.; 'The use of all vitamins, enzymes, minerals, dietary supplements and foods, (dietary supplements include those substances found in herbs, the earth and animal tissue, whether raw or refined); 'The use of antiseptics, analgesics, germicides, antibiotics and other hygienic and sanitary measures; 'The use of all diagnostic measures in determining the degree and kind of diseases including the drawing of blood or venipuncture, the use of X-ray and fluoroscopy; 'The practice of chiropractic as outlined by the Specialty Societies approved by the Board.' The proctologists are the strongest of the many specialty societies, and two members of the board are open and avowed practitioners of proctology. Some idea of the nature and scope of the 'specialties' may be gained from the announcement of the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic which last Fall offered graduate courses in the following subjects: Proctology, roentgenology; obstetrics and pediatrics; gynecology and cardiology. If that isn't sufficiently broad to suit one's purpose, then he may enroll in the Fremont College School of Medicine in Los Angeles, where he may acquire an 'M.D.' degree in three semesters (48 weeks - 16 hours per week - cost $1,250.00). The school comes completely equipped with four of the Maryland-type M.D. diplomates on its faculty and movie films by courtesy of the United States Army and the United States Armed Forces Institute. Although the faculty roster lists only M.D. and Ph.D. degrees,four names appearing on the faculty also hold chiropractic licenses. How long this state of affairs will be permitted to exist without drastic reforms is anyone's guess. But California chiropractors who want no part of this travesty on chiropractic have grave cause for concern about their future. Already in the legislative hopper are many bills aimed at the evil, including a basic science bill and a cancer quack measure. 1957-1959: RW Dishman DC, ND serves as Administrative Dean and Editor of the Hollywood Chiropractic College magazine, \"Chiropractic Life\" 1958: Henry G.

Although one faculty memberwas introduced as an \"associate dean,\" he had no assigned office space in the college or administrative duties outside his own classroom.

Martin (1986) wrotes: ...When, in 1962 Dr Haynes requested me to activate the Alumni for a fund raising campaign, I called Dr Joseph Berg, Dr Fred Bullard, and Dr Wayne Brown to join me in a Capital Funds Committee. In 1960 I had acted as chairman of a similar committee for the Southern California and Southwest of the Congregational Church Conference. The territory included southern California, southern Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and El Paso, Texas. The goal was to raise $2,000,000, and this was 80% achieved by 1960 due largely to the expertise of Richard Augustine, a professional fund raiser for churches. Our LACC 1,100 mile long state of California was larger than the usual church parish, but we managed to produce enough funds to pay off the mortgage to Cecil B. DeMille, and thereby eliminate the unfortunate burden of the DeMille taxes on the school property,and thereafter enjoy the benefits of our tax-free status. This fact gave Dr Haynes more freedom to pursue his objective as president of the ACA Council on Chiropractic Education, of Federal Accreditation of the Council. This was achieved in 1974, and it was a collosal achievement and a great personal victory for Dr Haynes. Without his personal dedication and expertise it may not have come about. PHOTOGRAPH M.

The amalgamation of the CCC student records with those of the LACC took place on August 3, 1963. Through the gracious cooperation of Dr G. Stanley Hesse the dream of amalgamating the graduates of the different California schools under one protective roof has taken another step towards realization.California Chiropractic College President Hesse, with a view to strengthen the educational development of our profession and desirous of protecting the graduates of his college, has transferred all his students' records to the LACC 'for that college to act as a permanent repository of records for the students of Chiorpractic that graduated or attended the California Chiropractic College.' He also wishes that the CCC graduates be considered as part of the LACC alumni. The college is more than glad to accede to this request. The LACC re-assures the graduates of the CCC of the fulfillment of all its obligations assumed by the amalgamation, including the certification of credits earned. This amalgamation following that with the Hollywood College of Chiropractic, took place last November fifth. It is powerful evidence of the rapidly developing solidarity of Chiropractic in California. A great debt of gratitude is owed to Dr Helen Sanders and Dr Robert Gray of the former Hollywood College for their unselfish action in supporting Chiropractic educational progress and forcibly giving it added impetus. 1963 (Nov): Chirogram [Vol. 30, No. 9]: -has a referee process for manuscripts (p. 2) -Ralph J.

The chiropractor, Marvin Phillips, 35, was found guilty on the prosecution's contention that the case fell under the state law that a death occurring in commission of a grand theft is second degree murder. Phillips was accused of fraudulently claiming that he could cure 8-year-old Lind Epping.

At this time there was a lot of talk about amalgamation of the 'straight' ICA and the NCA 'liberal' into one new organization, the ACA. Delegates Dr Asa Brown in Virginia and Dr Ruth Mandell in Maryland got wind of the fact that it was a sell-out to the ICA, and contacted me by phone. As soon as this information was confirmed I contacted all the Western states delegates by phone, and we set up a meeting in Reno, Nevada, the most central point for all of us. Flying to Reno I jotted down notes for an agenda for the meeting. As soon as we all got together at the designated hotel in the evening, we set to work on the agenda, and continued in session all night, and broke up at 6:30 the next morning. We met in Denver a few days later with nearly all the delegates, and hammered out strategy for the House of Delegates' official meeting the next morning. When the House of Delegates meeting convened, a motion was made and passed to go into a session of a Committee of the Whole. This was done, and the House of Delegates remained in the Committee of the Whole for nearly four days while we completely rewrote the new by-laws which had been prepared by the ICA-NCA negotiators. During this time, when we were not in official meetings, we kept all the delegates in closed caucus sessions. As a result, the actions of the Committee of the Whole were passed officially by a resounding majority, and the sell-out had been thwarted.1963: HCC merges with LACC 1990) 1963-64: LACC college catalogue lists \"38 active instructors, 18 of whom had academic degrees (three of these had Ph.D. degrees, but did not have DC degrees)\" (Homola, 1963) 1964: \"CA Attorney General Stanley Mosk rules that state welfare board cannot deny chiropractic services to welfare recipients\" (Smallie, 1990) 1964 (Feb): ACA & caption (p. 25): The ACA Council on Education is shown around the conference table at midyear meeting (left to right): Dr. L.F.

Maynard Lipe, (LACC Registrar's collection)1965 (June 21-23): \"Report of 32nd Annual Congress, Council of State Chiropractic Examining Boards, Diplomat Hotel, Hollywood, Florida\"; includes: -General Cronk gave a report quoting figures showing a drop in state licensing when states required two years pre-professional. Figures quoted for the states of North Carolina, Wisconsin, Connecticut and New Jersey. In each state as son as the requirements went into effect the number of licenses dropped considerably. Dr. Chambers, Secretary-Treasurer of the North Carolina State Board, stated the figures quoted for North Carolina were not correct. Dr. Cronk said there was a drop in student enrolment for this period also. Dr. Haynes asked if a study had been made as to the modification in number or percentage of students entering the school with college in relation to years past. Dr. Cronk said yes, there had been a small increase in percentage each year, it has been going up. About 25 to 30%, an increase of 5 to 6% from what we had about five or six years ago. If the enrollment were cut to this 25 to 30% the colleges couldn't survive. Dr. Haynes stated that in their case it is now 56%, and there is no question that there will be a decrease in enrollment, however, the question is which is the ultimate. Is our having two years of pre-college going to have any effect on our participation in the present health insurance program? Dr. Stoner asked if we are losing twice as many as we are producing, what effect is this having on the total profession. Large numbers are going into retirement age and we are not replenishing them. This is our major concern. Dr. Wolfe said they were hoping to move into this slowly so that the attrition rate on our profession is not too detrimental in the long run. Northwestern requires two years and they have experienced a drop in enrollment but it hasn't been as substantial as expected. They have already reached the point, after threeyears, where there is a substantial increase in the number of applicants. Dr. Cleveland feels that a chiropractor loss is serious whatever it is due to. Dr. Haynes thinks the situation is beginning to take care of itself much as the high school requirement did. Years ago we had quite a number of people with high school equivalent. That became less and less until now we have hardly any. Where a few years ago we had fewer students with two years college, that is on the increase. If we continue to work towards this it will bring about a larger percentage of student body with two years of college. It would be much wiser to work toward this among ourselves and not have it enacted into law. We have been losing about 255 a year quite steadily for several years. Dr. Fenton said we must recognize this and take definite steps now towards the goal we hope to reach in eight or ten years from now. He is not in favor of legislating this into law, but feels we must raise our standards ourselves. Dr. Sherman stated the schools are working towards this just as fast as they can and he is in favor of urging the schools to continue this. Dr. Janse stated that somewhere along the line we are going to have to make a conclusion. Our profession is going to have to establish a calendar. Whether the state boards do it or whether the schools do or whether both do, I don't know. The Council on Education of the ACA have assumed the responsibility and are going to discharge this responsibility. By 1968 all the ACA accredited colleges will accept students who have had two years of liberal arts education as of September 31, 1968. They must have it before they enter the colleges. We have to live with it. We do not believe that either Osteopathy, Dentistry or Medicine are going to do away with their pre-professional requirements. They may modify them to make them a little more human. Eventually, the best Doctor of Chiropractic will be the one who has had a substantial solid background in a good amount of college English, biology, some chemistry, psychology and literature. More isexpected of the Doctor of Chiropractic today than it was twenty years ago. Dr. Cleveland stated that he did not doubt the sincerity and honesty with which Dr. Janse and the others have gone into this problem. They have gone into it just as sincerely and honestly and understand that liberal arts education is a good thing. They want it to, and are striving toward it but feel that their colleges cannot survive if they accept the two year college requirement at this time or in 1968. They do not feel that the ACA colleges can survive on this program either. Dr. Sherman feels that students entering college for two years with the thought of going on to chiropractic school get sidetracked into engineering or some other field. We are losing some this way. He doesn't feel we should designate pre-college just yet. Dr. Janse stated that the total responsibility of this concern resides in the membership of our profession in the field. It is their responsibility to make the practice of Chiropractic more attractive, more rewarding, more secure, more insuring; so that the young man or woman that contemplates chiropractic as a career will not concern him or herself about one or two years of pre-professional requirement because the end result is so charged with the dynamics of invite, of proper professional status, that the sacrifice will be made without any question. The ACA colleges have committed themselves. Dr. Haynes stated that they came to this decision not because they felt there was something to gain monetarily for the schools, but with the idea that we as schools are facing a very difficult program. We know we are threatened with death as schools, that it is going to mean hours of... 1965 (July/Aug): Digest of Chiropractic Economics [8(1)] includes: -\"College reports: Los Angeles College\" (p.

Kimmel DC on ACA stationery as District Governor at 8514 Fifth Ave., Brooklyn NY 11209, to Stanley Hayes DC (Hayes collection): Dear Stanley: Sorry about the tone of my letter. Perhaps if I had waited a day or two it would not have been so sever. Actually, it wasn't meant to offend youl, but just to enlighten you as to the purpose of the resolution, and where I got the wording.In answer to your questions; first, I don't know why it took so long for the resolution to appear in the Journal. I can send you copies of correspondence in September, requesting Art Schierholz to get that in the Journal. He really didn't have an explanation when I confronted him with the same question in Des Moines in January. As for the reason my letter took so long, it is because your Bulletins don't arrive as first class mail, and the letter which was sent to you had to wait for the return of my secretary, who had been out sick. Believe me, I did not mean to offend you, or put you on the defensive. If I did, I'm sorry. You are so right, when you say that \"They are not going to let anybody with your ability get very far\", and that I am a \"conspicuously prominent danger to the clique\". As a matter of fact, I've been on a few peoples backs recently, and they don't like it when I start to call the signals. Frankly, Stanley, I don't know where to turn from here. This is very frustrating and time consuming position to hold, and honestly it's beginning to take its toll in loss of practice and time away from the office. My family is on my neck, my patient's resent my leaving so much and my practice is off over $1,500 from last year at this time. That's a significant drop and pays a lot of bills. To put it bluntly, I don't feel as if I can afford the luxury of going any further in ACA. If I were independently wealthy, and could afford it I would pave my way to President, but I'm just a chiropractor, who depends upon his practice for a livelihood, to support myself and my family. It's nice of you to say all those wonderful things about me, and it is certainly flattering to my generally deflated ego, but after being in this profession for half of my life (twenty years) I realize that if I were in any other endeavor, and I worked as hard for it as I have for chiropractic, I'd be a very rich man by this time. The time, devation, energy and oil that goes with it that I've given this profession seems to be, only in some small way beginning to pay off in some amount of self satisfaction that we may after all accomplish something.If I find that I am going to be thwarted at every turn, If I find that my time becomes so preoccupied with ACA and it's politics, I'm going to pick up my marbles and go home, reconcentrate my efforts in my practice, and go back to teaching (which I did for fifteen years) at the Chiropractic Institute of New York. It took me a long time to get my political feet wet, now that I have, I don't want to drown in the muck. I know the importance of good leadership, but unfortunately good leadership is not only hard to come by, but it does not come cheaply. I've been on top of Higley recently concerning research. He's been with us for about three years now and frankly all he's done is some work on methodology and statistics. Not one basic piece of research which scientifically substantiates chiropractic principles. He's beginning to feel my squeeze and he's hollern \"politics\". He doesn't realize that I'm on his side, just want him to do a better job. That's why I was instrumental in disapproving his five year research plan. In plain words, it was lousy! I may not do too well on a budget sub-committee, but when it comes to research, there I can function effectively. We'll see what happens. By the way, believe me when I say that our Board is clean. I can truthfully say that! If anything which smells badly comes out, it is the staff at Des Moines who is to blame not the Board. The \"harmony\" that existed during the mid-year meetings was preceeded by a hell of a lot of calling down on a number of issues, long before we officially went into our meetings and on the record. What may appear to be a smooth meeting was prolonged by many messy personal issues and grievances. Again, we'll see what the results of this will be. That's it for now - I hope I'm forgiven - Sorry for the misunderstanding. Sincerely,... 1966 (Mar/Apr): Digest of Chiropractic Economics [8(5)] includes: -\"College reports: Los -Anthony D.

Dr. Higley was one of the outstanding scientists in the country, with a listing and biography in both American Men of Science and in Leaders in American Science. His research extended not only into areas relating to chiropractic and physical medicine, but also into the fields of drugs and nutrition, space medicine, industrial problems, and he was a member of the Research Committee for the Los Angeles County Delinquency and Crime Commission. He had written and presented many important scientific papers for scientific organizations. His research on the Intervertebral Disc Syndrome and his work on Cineroentgenology of the Human Spine, met with world-wide acceptance. He was the co-author of a textbook on General Chemistry. Dr. Higley was born of American parents in Lima, Peru. He was educated in the University of Guadalajara, the University of Nuevo Leon, the University of Southern California, the Ratledge College of Chiropractic, and the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic.At the time of his passing, he was, in addition to his position with the American Chiropractic Association, the director of research and the chairman of the Department of Physiology of the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic in Glendale, California. He is survived by his wife, Mary, by one son, Henry, Jr., of Seattle, Washington, and by his mother, Mrs. Rosaria Higley, of Los Angeles. Funeral services were held in Alhambra, California on May 23.

This Corporation bought the old individually owned Los Angeles College of Chiropractic and merged it with the Southern California College of Chiropractic in 1947, thus forming the present LACC. Since that time the Alumni and most of the records of the California College of Natural Healing Arts, Continental Chiropractic College, San Francisco College of Chiropractic, California Chiropractic College and Hollywood College of Chiropractic have been merged with Los Angeles College of Chiropractic. The Foundation is non-profit containing in its recorded Bylaws a non-revocable clause to the effect that in case of dissolution the entire assets of this corporation must be turned over to the California Chiropractic Association and the American Chiropractic Association, who jointly would dispose of said assets. The Foundation's self-perpetuating board holds the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic corporation and its assets in trust for the profession. Desirous of indicating that this College does not only serve a California city but actually the State of California and the entire Southwest, a search for a new name was instituted. Being unwilling to give up the goodwill and high academic reputation attached to the name \"Los Angeles College of Chiropractic,\" the Board of Trustees saw fit to change the name of the \"California Chiropractic Educational Foundation\" to \"California Chiropractic Colleges\" without changing the name of the LACC corporation.Thus, from now on, the College will be known as \"Los Angeles College of Chiropractic, a subsidiary of California Chiropractic Colleges. 1971 (Feb 9): Sylmar earthquake damages to LACC total $35,000 (LACC, 1986) 1971 (Apr): Chirogram Frank E.

I have reference to the book \"A Doctor Dares to Tell,\" and \"It is Cheaper to Die,\" and in National Health Federation Bulletin; \"The Quality of Mercy\" by Selig Greenberg (that pertains to the prescription drug scandal), among others. It was therefore a surprise when one of my former colleagues, an M.D., sent me a photostat of an article by Richard S. Wilbur, M.D., which appeared in JAMA February 22, 1971. Dr. Wilbur, who is Deputy Vice-President of AMA, seems to be perturbed with the progress that the chiropractic profession (cult, according to Dr. Wilbur) is making. In the light of the number of criticisms being leveled at \"organized\" medicine, one might inquire why a man of the stature of Dr. Wilbur will take time to be concerned with the flea on an elephant's back when there is so much housecleaning to be done in his own organization. In the July, 1971 issue of Medical Economics is an article that may not be reproduced, quoted, paraphrased in whole or in part. It dares to take a view diametrically opposed to that of Dr. Wilbur. It happens that this small group of healers, the chiropractors, has helped thousands who were not helped by medicine and my name could be added to these thousands. I can think of no better way of ending this letter than recalling a very pertinent question in Matthew 7:3: \"Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own for Hiss MD's Functional Foot Disorders, 3rd Edition; published by Regent House, 108 N Roselake Ave -AV Nilsson DC, ND, LLB (cover) -notes Vierling Kersey PedD is still president, George Haynes MS, is Dean (p. 6); also lists (pp. 14-6) LACC faculty (full-time): -Wolf Adler DO, LLB, DC, Chairman of the Department of Pathology -JG Anderson DC, Chairman of Chiropractic Principles -JG Kirby DC, editor of Chirogram -AV Nilsson BA, DC, Dean of Students -Olson DC, Clinic Director -Harold H Payne DC, Chairman, Department of Diagnosis -Ralph Pressman PhG, MS, PhD, Chairman of Department of Public Health and Director of Research -Philip Runsten BA, DC, library supervisor, clinic x-ray department -Schultz BA, DC, laboratories -Stokes DC, photography, Chirogram -Valusek BS, DC, resigned in April, 1971 -LaDochy PhD, replaces Valusek -Watts BA, DC, Chair, Department of -Robinson clinician -Derk DC, clinician -lists (p. 16) BA, DC, on 1-yr leave of absence, psychiatry -Painton MA, EdD, psychology-Patton BA, DC, psychiatry -Phil Brown, LLB, DC, office procedures -Drengler BS, DC, physics, physical therapy -Jano BA, DC, Public Health II -Frank Schoenholtz DC, (June): ACA Journal from A.C.

Santos DC, chairman of LACC Department of Roentgenology (cover)1973 (Dec): Western Journal of Medicine [119(6): 44-5] issues statement of the California Medical Association: Chiropractic CHIROPRACTORS DISAGREE among themselves on the definition of chiropractic. One group, known as the \"straights,\" adheres basically to a rigid definition, holding that the sole route to restoration of health, no matter what the problem, is through manual manipulation of the spine. A second group, known as the \"mixers,\" advocates the use of such modalities as heat, light, water, electricity, vitamins, colonic irrigation and other physical and mechanical adjuncts, in addition to spinal adjustments. Each group is represented by a national organization. The chiropractic concept of disease is unsupported by scientific facts, and causes of infections and other diseases cannot be explained by the chiropractic theory of that disease is caused by a \"subluxation\" (partial dislocation) in the spinal column. Many chiropractors claim to be able to cure everything from headache to cancer by spinal manipulation - although medical research has proved their claims impossible. In regard to education, a study by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare notes \"irrespective of its theory, the scope and quality of chiropractic education do not prepare the practitioner to make an adequate diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment.\" Furthermore, no chiropractic school is accredited by any nationally recognized educational accrediting agency in the United States and chiropractic education is provided for the most part by chiropractors without a degree from an accredited college. Forty-eight states impose license limitations on chiropractic, prohibiting chiropractors from prescribing drugs and performing surgery. Two other states - Louisiana and Mississippi - do not issue even limited licenses. The scientific community - including the medical profession - regards chiropractic as an unscientific cult, the largest group of unscientific practitioners in the United States. CMA's PositionCMA has emphasized repeatedly that chiropractic is an unscientific cult and that its practitioners lack the training and background to diagnose and treat human disease. Chiropractic is not a practice of medicine and constitutes a hazard to health in the United States because of the substandard and unscientific education of its pracititoners and their rigid adherence to an irrational, unscientific approach to disease causation. A patient who relies on chiropractic may delay proper medical care until serious and irreversible damage occurs. CMA pursues public recognition of this principle through public education campaigns and works to discourage chiropractic and other cultism in all ways. The California Medical Association strongly disapproves of the payment of Medi-Cal, Medicare, Workmen's Compensation, Veterans Administration and other funds to chiropractors. In addition, CMA has worked against inclusion of chiropractors in any insurance contracts. 1973: Herman S.

It was pursuant to this authority that the Commissioner made his August 1974 decision. This decision of the Commissioner to list the Accrediting Commission of the Council on Chiropractic Education was made only after careful deliberation of all arguments both for and against recognition. The record reveals that prior to the Commissioner's decision, representatives of the American Medical Association reviewed the petition submitted by the Council on Chiropractic Education, submitted written material in refutation of the petition and appeared at the March 1973 meeting of the Commissioner's Advisory Committee on Accreditation and Institutional Eligibility to challenge the petition. The petition was subsequently denied and an appeal by the Council on Chiropractic Education to Commissioner was denied in October 1973. The petition was later reactivated by the Council and supplementary data were filed. Representatives of the American Medical Association appeared again at the May 1974 hearing before the Advisory Committee on Accreditation and Institutional Eligibility and protested the reactivated petition. The American Medical Association also met privately with the Commissioner prior to his final decision to recognize the Accrediting Commission of the Council on Chiropractic Education.I recognize the seriousness which you attach to this matter and the earnestness with which you have pressed your views. The authority for recognizing accrediting agencies rests by statute in the Commissioner of Education, and I believe the process by which the Commissioner reached his decision was fair to the parties concerned. I also note that the Accrediting Commission of the Council will be reviewed for renewal of recognized status in September 1975, and that the American Medical Association will have an opportunity to make presentations regarding that matter. After considering the viewpoints set forth in your letter of November 14, I have concluded that further action on my part regarding the Commissioner's decision is not warranted at this time... Dr. Hidde then submitted to questions from the floor... Dr. Hidde then stressed the importance of the various state boards recognizing the C.C.E. Standards either by Statute or by administrative rule, it would be helpful if by the latter part of the summer, probably August, they would send a letter of intent to C.C.E. stating that they have adopted a resolution and are preparing to accept the C.C.E. Standards. This would be most helpful to the C.C.E. when they go in for review of their H.E.W. approval in September.

It would seem that Ralph took offense at my candor, although he has known me for many years and should have realized that when asked for a frank assessment, he is likely to get just that, otherwise it would have been a non-committal, diplomatic response. I deeply regret any bruised feelings that may have been caused to one whom I have respected and admired for years, as well as thinking of him as \"friend.\"For almost 40 years I have been emphasizing the teachings of D.D. Palmer that environmental stress, mechanical, chemical and/or psychological causes subluxation, and the location is dependent upon heredity (body type), posture, prior traumata, degree of concentration of the stress, irritability of the N.S., etc. Such stress may well have an autonomic influence in addition to the somatic, since the body is an unit of structure and function and one system is not activated without activity in the other, i.e., muscle contraction requires increased blood supply (sympathetic control). However, the autonomic response, therefore visceral alteration, is generalized, as in the fight-flight mechanism. Another factor must be introduced to focus the dysfunction in a specific viscus or visceral system. This chiropractic does admirably... 1984 (Feb 17): letter from A.E. Homewood, D.C., N.D., LL.B. to Ralph J. Martin, D.C., N.D. (in my Martin file): Dear Ralph:- Yours of the 12th received today and, as I feared, offence was taken at my response to your criticism of chiropractic theory. I am at a loss to understand your remark, \"I am surprised that you discount my credibility of my many case histories, but I guess that explains why academia has give me such a bad time.\" There has never been any thought or intent to discredit any of your work or writings. I have never had anything but the deepest respect and regard for you as both a man and a practitioner. It is my intent only to share with you thoughts that might contribute to the total explanation and make it more meaningful for all concerned. D.D.'s chiropractic was so seriously bastardized by the one- cause-one-cure boys that it has taken many years to get across the idea that the subluxation is an important cog in the process from environmental stress to disease or pathology and, as I see the picture, without the subluxation the body response is generalized as in the flight-fight response. What I thought that I was doing for you, was to help you to see how your discussions of stress were likely targeting specific organs, not with any thought ofdenigrating your contribution to our understanding of the body's response to stress. Criticism of chiropractic always stirs the inferiority complex and causes a response that may be more harsh than justified. For such, I apologize and beg forgiveness. How strange that I never knew about your brother being a fellow alumnus of Homer Beatty's. Many thanks for the picture which is excellent of Homer and Louisa. There was one more to make it six children in all. He got off to a late start, but made up for lost time. It was interesting to learn that your son had been married in your home by the Rt. Rev. Dr. Jay Davis Kirby and that he was headed for Portland. Sorry to hear that your wrists are giving you problems. That must have been quite a fall. I finally got rid of my sciatica, after about 18 months of pain that I hope never to repeat. Now there is just the odd twinge in the hip. My #6 \"son\" arrived from Thailand on Dec. 19th and is struggling with the language. Don has returned to college and doing nicely. I hope to go up home in March to make some video tapes for CMCC on History, Principles and Technique, then bring my sister back with us. All the best to you and yours. Ever yours, Earl 1990 (Aug): Chiropractic Technique [2(3)] includes: -Ian D. Coulter, Ph.D., president of Canadian Memorial College, authors \"In memoriam: Dr. Earl Homewood\" (p. 74); presented at the Consensus Conference on Validation of Chiropractic Methods, Seattle, March 1990: I have been given the sad task of saying a few words in honor of Earl Homewood who passed away this week, and listening to the introduction to the conference I said to myself that it seems peculiar that this is an historic occasion and is probably the launching of a new future for chiropractic; and, on the very week that we are doing that, in the death of Earl Homewood, we alsosee the end of another tradition in chiropractic, the end of another era. Most of you know of the great achievements of Earl, not only at Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC), but his involvement at Los Angeles Chiropractic College , Western States, and Lincoln College. Probably the only individual in chiropractic to have that kind of a record. You know him from his scholarship and from his publications and you know him from his commitment to the profession. What I would like to do just briefly is to share with you something from my own personal relationship with Earl. I knew him a lot less than most of you did. Dr. Don Sutherland and Herb Vear, who are present today, probably knew him at least since 1945. I only knew him from my time at CMCC, which is about 8 years. I recall the first occasion I met Earl. He came to visit me and because I had heard of this man (at CMCC he is considered one of the greats) I was rather overawed by this visit. He proceeded to tell me that no non-DC should be president of a chiropractic college. Of course that is not an opinion I hold myself and so Earl and I had a very heated and lengthy debate about it. He went away and I thought \"that is probably the last I am going to see of Earl Homewood.\" Six months later he was back and this time the debate was about using Ph.D. faculty to teach the basic sciences. Earl was not in favor of that either. Again, I did not agree with him, we had another argument and away he went; and again I thought, \"Perhaps that is his last visit.\" I think that I saw Earl about every 6 months for the last 8 years, or heard from him. About 6 months ago, I had a lengthy letter from him, telling me how wrong it would be for CMCC to join a university. I tell you these stories because I think it is fitting in this context. He was a very cantankerous individual. The dean of CMCC, who met Earl about 6 months ago, came to tell me he had committed an awful faux pas. He had taken Dr. Homewood to lunch and had a very strong argument with him in the restaurant. The dean was not sure what Homewood was going to tell me. I said, \"He will be back. He has been doing this for 8 years.\" But Earl was very critical, very critical of what we do in the profession, very critical about what we are trying to achieve. Ibecame a very close personal friend of Earl Homewood; a very good friend, I think; and, I appreciated him very much. I did not always agree with him. He was an enigma. He was a giant in the profession yet he could be very annoying. I am going to regret his passing. I think the profession is. I just wanted to share with you that this was a giant. He had, I think, something that would have been absolutely essential at this conference, that is, the ability to be critical. He really would argue with anyone, about anything, and all in the interest of chiropractic. I do not think that there will be as many in the future who come along as important as Earl Homewood. His major publication, as a piece of scholarship, apart from the content of it, was a monument to a young generation. In the 60's he introduced to chiropractors the importance of being a scholar. However, I would like to share with you what was happening at CMCC during this period when he was doing that. We were on the brink of oblivion. We had a million dollar debt that would translate into about a $10 million debt in today's world. If we had that now, I would be looking for another occupation. Earl, of course, stayed around to do something about it. The city had appropriated a large part of our property; they built a subway under it; the building was partially collapsing; the student enrollment was falling off. It really looked as though CMCC might not survive. Dr. Homewood, however, was planning and dreaming and building another college, and he literally saved CMCC. The last comment I would like to make, in closing this tribute to Earl (and I know he would like me to say it, because he was a very honest individual) is that despite what he gave to the profession, Earl was not well treated by chiropractic. He was very bitter about that and spoke at some length about it. I have to say that I agree with him. I hope therefore that in death, we treat him kinder than we did in life.

As I continued with my research on Dr. Henry Harrower, I found that, although LACC indeed owned (or at least occupied) Harrower's buildings on East Broadway, there were several other owners in between. One of these, interestingly enough, was Cecil B. DeMille, who hoped to operate part of his filmmaking operation there. But the occupant immediately following the closing of Harrower's laboratory was the pharmaceutical company Lambert Pharmaceuticals. Their present owner, Pfizer, may indeed have what is left of the library. Here is the story from an article in the Glendale News Press: \"In 1945 the building was sold to Lambert Pharmaceuticals, which continued to produce the pill, then to filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille, who unsuccessfully tried to use it as a film laboratory. From 1950 to '82, the building was transformed from a mecca of endocrinology to what Joe Keating, professor and author of a book on the history of Los Angeles College of Chiropractic, calls the 'hub' of the chiropractic field. Today one can see the remnants of the school... In the last 20 years, the two-story, state-of-the-art clasroom added by LACC and the rest of the campus have been used by a burgeoning computer firm, Integrated Systems Group Incorporated in the early 1980s, and now by Tobinworld, a school for autistic and severly emotionally disturbed children.\" If you should discover more regarding the Harrower library, please let me know. In the meantime, thanks for your help and interest.

His wife, Clara C. Lackey, was a 1942 graduate of Los Angeles College of Chiropractic and she preceded her husband in death by three years. Dr. Lackey held dual degrees in chiropractic and naturopathy, practicing in the Los Angeles area for many years. He was a proponent of increasing educational standards within alternative health care education and spent many years teaching in addition to his private practice. He served as Academic Dean of the Southern California College of Chiropractic from 1944 to 1945 just prior to its merger with LACC. He concurrently served as president of SCCC's sister institution, the College of Naturopathic Physicians and Surgeons, from 1944 to 1946. In addition to his career in chiropractic and naturopathic education, Dr. Lackey played an important political role within the chiropractic profession. In 1939, he served as president of the National-Affiliated Chiropractors of California, an early broad- scoped professional organization. After the formation of the California Chiropractic Association, during the 1940s, he served that organization as its president from 1959 to 1960. Both of the Lackeys were avid golfers and Patrick maintained an outstanding collection of classic golf clubs and memorabilia. He had been a member of the Riviera Country Club and, in 1952, he was the Tournament Chairman for the Los Angeles Open. Patrick's brother, William D. Lackey, also graduated from LACC in 1941, and preceded his brother in death by several years. William's eldest daughter was named Patricia - in honor of his older brother. -\"In memoriam: Joseph Berg - 1944\" (p. 15): Dr. Joseph Berg died on January 12, 2003 in Bakersfield, CA. He was a native New Yorker and entered LACC at the age of 37. After graduation, he practiced in Los Angeles and San Marino, CA. For many years he served as faculty member in the Post- Graduate Division of the College. Dr. Berg also served as Alumni Association President during 1966. He is survived by his wife, Jean Baughman-Berg.2003 (Sept 28): e-mail forwarded from Lou Sportelli, D.C.: From: Karen Howard AANP Executive Director [mailto:bigenews092603@topica.email-publisher.com] September 26, 2003 3:07 PM Subject: LEGISLATIVE ALERT: CA BILL SIGNED!

Governor Gray Davis has signed SB 907 into law! After many long years, NDs will FINALLY be able to be licensed in California! The Naturopathic Doctors Act will go into effect on January 1, 2004, with the first NDs being licensed late next year. Our heartfelt thanks are extended to each and every one of you for your calls, letters, and show of support throughout this challenging licensure campaign. We could not have achieved so much without the collective effort of so many. We look forward to sharing the benefits of naturopathic health care with you in the future and hope that you will join with us in celebrating this tremendous victory for consumer access to natural medicine! Sincerely, Sally LaMont, ND, LAc CANP Executive Director Beth Wotton, ND CANP Legislative Chair A synopsis of the main features of the new law is included at the end of this email. 2. FROM THE OFFICE Karen Howard, Executive Director, AANP On this next Monday, September 29, 2003 the Washington DC City Council Committee on Human Services will hold a hearing on Bill 15-57, legislation to license naturopathic physicians. This is likely to be the only opportunity we have for public comment before the Committee and the City Council vote. The opposition is once again mobilizing, and while our support is strong it is critical that our voices be heard on this bill. If you have not already done so, please submit written testimony in support of thebill to Eric Goulet, Legislative Analyst for Health and Aging Issues Committee on Human Services at egoulet@dccouncil.us. Please provide your name, telephone number and organizational affiliation (if any). Statements being submitted for the record must be received within seven days after the hearing. The intent of this legislation is as follows: to define the practice of naturopathic medicine, and enable NDs to practice to the scope of their training; to establish the Advisory Committee on Naturopathic Medicine, which will develop guidelines for licensing and regulation of naturopathic medicine; to establish the requirements for licensure, including successful completion of a full-time, doctoral-level, accredited naturopathic medical program and successful completion of NPLEX, and to redefine the practice of naturopathy by prohibiting those who are currently registered with the District of Columbia as naturopaths from practicing outside the scope of their education and training, while at the same time permitting them to continue recommending natural medicines until the title of \"Registered Holistic Health Counselor\". As you all learned in the California effort, personalizing your message in a concise letter on your own letterhead is the most effective means of communication. The talking points are much the same, and the importance of passage just as essential to our profession. Imagine the impact licensure in the Nation's Capitol would have on our public policy efforts! YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION (IF ANY) Testimony in support of Bill 15-57 The Practice of Naturopathic Medicine Licensing Amendment Act of 2003 Council of the District of Columbia Committee on Human Services 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20004 Dear Chairperson Allen and Members of the Subcommittee: 1. Ask for support of Bill 15-57. Let the Committee know if you are a constituent, or if you want to move to the District topractice. Tell them what passage of the bill will mean to you personally. 2. District of Columbia residents have a right to access qualified, clinically-trained Naturopathic Doctors, just as citizens of the 12 states and two territories that currently license NDs. 3. Licensure of Naturopathic Doctors will: Improve access to natural health care: NDs will be able to practice to the full scope of their training in natural medicine. Consumers will benefit from disease prevention and health promotion. Natural medicine is an important part of solving the District1s health care crisis. Improve public safety: Creating new standards will help consumers identify NDs who have completed a four-year, graduate-level medical school program, passed board exams, and who meet federally recognized standards of education and professional accountability. Ensure accountability: Consumers deserve regulatory standards and oversight mechanisms for all primary care providers, including naturopathic doctors.

SYNOPSIS OF CALIFORNIA LAW by Michael Traub, ND, AANP President The link to the bill, as passed with amendments, is: http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/bill/sen/sb_0901- 0950/sb_907_bill_20030902_enrolled.pdf Words cannot express the gratitude that is due to all those who contributed to this success. In my opinion, this is the single-most important achievement to ever have occurred for the naturopathic profession, and possibly the most significant event which ever will occur in our profession's history. Special thanks to Sally LaMont, Beth Wotton, Jon Kvenvolden, Sandi Cutler, David Matteson, David Field, Carl Hangee-Bauer, all the past and present CANP members and officers, the lobbyists and consultants, all the college presidents and college representatives who assisted and provided testimony, and all AANP members who wrote letters in support of this bill.Summary of SB 907's main points: This legislation does not prevent or restrict the practices, services, or activities of any other practitioner, consultant, or individual; nor does it restrict or prevent individuals engaged in the sale of vitamins, nutritional supplements, herbs, homeopathic remedies, etc. Naturopathic medicine is a distinct and comprehensive system of primary health care practiced by naturopathic doctors for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of human health conditions, injuries, and disease that employs natural therapies, therapeutic substances, and education to promote and restore health by supporting and stimulating the individual's self-healing processes. With some exceptions (see below), NDs will be permitted to practice to the scope of their training, including diagnosis and treatment modalities such as natural substances, herbs, nutritional supplements, homeopathic remedies, physical medicine, and minor office procedures. NDs completing additional training in natural childbirth will be eligible for a specialty certificate in naturopathic childbirth attendance which will allow for the management of normal pregnancy, labor, delivery, and postpartum care. The titles and professional abbreviation reserved for individuals licensed under this legislation are: licensed naturopathic doctor, naturopathic doctor, doctor of naturopathic medicine, doctor of naturopathy, naturopathic medical doctor, and \"N.D.\" Those in violation of this law be subject to a fine of not more than $5,000, one year in county jail, or both. NDs licensed under this act will be subject to the same standards of regulatory oversight and peer review as other licensed health care professionals. The term \"naturopathy\" is NOT protected under this act, and is defined as \"a noninvasive system of health practice that employs natural modalities, substances and education to promote health.\" The act does not limit the practice of naturopathy, and does not restrict use of the terms \"naturopath, naturopathic practitioner, or traditional naturopathic practitioner.\"The act establishes a Bureau of Naturopathic Medicine within the Dept. of Consumer Affairs (DCA) , and an Advisory Council including 3 NDs licensed in California. The Director of the DCA will appoint a Naturopathic Formulary Advisory Committee to determine the naturopathic formulary based on a review of naturopathic medical education and training, and make recommendations to the Legislature not later than Jan. 1, 2006 regarding prescriptive authority. The Bureau will also establish a naturopathic childbirth attendance advisory committee to issue recommendations concerning naturopathic childbirth attendance, based on a review of education and training, by Jan. 1, 2006. And the Bureau will similarly make recommendations regarding minor office procedures by Jan. 1, 2006. The Bureau will establish requirements for satisfactory coursework in pharmacology as well. The act requires 60 hours of CE biennially, with at least 20 hours in pharmacotherapeutics. NDs may order and perform: phlebotomy, clinical lab tests, speculum exams and orificial exams. NDs may order diagnostic imaging, and may dispense and administer nutritional supplements, botanicals, homeopathic medicines, all dietary supplements and OTCs. NDs may do hydrotherapy, massage, electrotherapy, colon hydrotherapy, therapeutic exercise and \"joint play examination...exclusive of small amplitude movement at or beyond the end range of normal joint motion.\" NDs may prescribe therapeutic devices and barrier contraceptives, remove foreign bodies in superficial tissues, repair superficial lacerations and abrasions, but may not suture (until the Bureau makes recommendations regarding minor office procedures). Routes of administration include oral, nasal, auricular, ocular, rectal, vaginal, transdermal, intradermal, subcutaneous, intravenous and intramuscular. The furnishing and ordering of drugs and Schedule III - V controlled substances will be under MD/DO supervision. It does not require the physical presence of the MD/DO, but they must beavailable by phone at the time of the patient examination. Standard procedures and protocols must be established. NDs have independent prescriptive authority for natural and synthetic hormones and epinephrine for anaphylaxis. NDs cannot perform general or spinal anesthesia, abortions, and surgical procedures. NDs cannot perform acupuncture or traditional Chinese medicine unless licensed as an acupuncturist in California, including Chinese herbal medicines. NDs attending childbirth will be under the supervision of an MD/DO with current practice and training in OB. NDs providing childbirth services will be able to use appropriate drugs, IVs, vaccines, and equipment. Each director, shareholder, and officer of a naturopathic corporation, except assistant secretary or assistant treasurer, shall be a licensed healthcare provider as defined in the Corporations Code. The name of a naturopathic corporation shall contain the words \"naturopathic\" or \"naturopathic doctor.\" Naturopathic corporations must carry professional liability insurance. Karen Karen E.

My granddaughter, Debbie, is a wonderful lady. 9/1/37 I entered LACC as a student, evening classes. Dr. A.V. Nilsson taught anatomy. Dr. Wilma C. Wood was president of the school. Dr. Frank B. Hamilton taught O.B. and gynecology clinic. I did not meet Dr. Linnie A. Cale, but heard much of her. Dr. George Haynes was our chemistry teacher. Dr. Higley taught........ I heard much of Dr. Goodfellow, but never met him. I heard much of Dr. Bernard Jensen, but never met him Dr. Ralph Martin taught diagnosis. Dr. Maynard Lipe taught psychiatry.Dr. Delbert Metzinger taught technic and adjusting. He and Dr. A.V. Nilsson were backbone which held the college together. Dr. F. Miner was an excellent adjuster, student. Dr. Leo Montenegro was a popular student, not in our class. Dr. Lee Norcross became our CCA legal advisor. I visited the Ratledge school once. He preceeded me. Dr. L.P. Roberts taught diagnosis. 1941- I dropped out of school due to WWII, enlisted in U.S. Navy Hospital Corps, served with U.S. Marines, sent to Hawaii, completed a cost of Area Naval Hospital Base, returned and ????? discharge, and returned to Fresno, CA, to be with my wife and son and ??? twins. 1948- Returned to LACC to complete and graduate 6/15/50 with 5200 hours class time + navy experience gained. 1950. 1/15/50 graduated, passted State Board, received license. 9/1/50- Opened office in ???

I am now 80 years of age and ready to gbe transplanted to heaven to spend eternity with God. Best wishes upon your plans. David Aytes, D.C. _________________________________________ Letter from Robert W Dishman, MA, DC to J. Keating, 7/29/91: Dear Joe, I enclose a photo of myself as you requested. In reviewing the diploma records of LACC I note Ralph Martin graduated in the class of 1938-1939 from SCCC and who became pres. of LACC in 1949. I have his last address back in 1986 located in Arcadia (near Pasadena). EP Webb was clinic director and my first mentor for foot manipulation. Ralph Martin was on the teaching faculty the same year. Ralph Hoard DO also taught foot manipulation. Delbert Metzinger of LACC Faculty was a major contributor to my foot manipulation. In 1946-1947 B. Franklin Miner trained by Metzinger also was a major contributor to foot manipulation. Both Miner andMetzinger trained Elmer Bones DC who was on my faculty teaching manipulation head to toe. Dr. Miner I believe if my memory serves me was a member of the Board of Regents as was Paul Malipara DC. The latter has been a State Board member, but he remembers little or nothing of Hollywood College. Another resource for Hollywood College is Lavere H Latta BS, DC, who lives in Ventura or Santa Barbara. He is living and well. By the way, 1942 SCCC faculty is Clyde (not Claude) Martin who was a DO-physician & surgeon ENT specialist. Sorry - his last name is Gillette. There was a Clyde Martin in the era which has nothing to do with the subject. I will attempt to contact Ralph Martin by writing a letter. No phone is listed.

Logan (no relation to Vinton; wrote book on manipulation), Franklin Miner -Metzinger and Hiss Clinics were \"leading\" providers of foot manipulation -Dishman also learned foot manip informally from Mel Wheadon DC -Metzinger and Bones strove for audibles, sometimes hurt osteopathic techniques (\"relieving fibrosis by mobilization rather than thrusting\") & soft-tissue methods & stretching because more gentle, painless -Hiss Clinic: surprised Dishman; elevated chair for seated manip, some standing manipulations; no table; Hiss had a \"volume practice, but not as much as Locke\"; Hiss Clinic emphasized \"high velocity thrusting\" -\"Locke was a legend....probably an exaggeration....all different types of people.....ballet and other dancers were disabled....\", got quick relief from Locke -Locke's methods: Dishman had heard that \"he delivered a high velocity kind of thrust, and he did it very quickly. All the Locke maneuvers that we've been taught were high velocity thrusting....\" _________________________________________ Interview with William Andrew Nelson, DC, ND (1934 graduate of San Francisco College of Chiropractic [SFCC]) by J. Keating and R.A. Brown on 10/24/91; office: born on October 30, 1914-Nelson's diploma from SFCC dated March 9, 1934; date on seal says \"Incorporated June 13, 1922\" and is signed by \"LW Hosford DC, PhC, MC, of the Board\" DC, MC, Secretary of the Board\"; SFCC located on Sutter Street in SF -SFCC's president and owner was Leo W. Hosford , DC, who also operated a mortician's/embalming school, and possibly also the San Francisco College of Drugless Healing; Nelson recalls that Hosford \"was looking for any dollar he could get\" and he \"made a bundle of money\" -SFCC course was 2.5 years long (probably 2,400 hours); Nelson believes SFCC was only school operating in SF at the time; all 40 students (\"first, second and third year all together\") in one classroom on second floor of bldg; first floor was clinic, office and reception area; third floor was embalming college; no dissection: anatomy learned from textbooks; Hosford taught philosophy (i.e., \"chiropractic can cure anything\") -SFCC instructors included a Dr. Martin, who taught physiology, diagnosis, anatomy and patholgy, and Dr. [?Frank?] Hamilton, who taught OB/GYN [Frank Hamilton DC had been dept chair and taught OB/GYN at LACC in 1950 (Gibbons, 1982)] -Nelson's diploma from Sierra States University, College of Naturopathy [SSU/CN] dated March, 1939 & date on seal of SSU/CN is July 20, 1927; diploma signatories were \"Raymond L. Peters, President of the Board, Morie Peters, Secretary of the Board, FE Fiske DC, ND, GT O'Sullivan PhD, ND, Terrence J Bennett DC, ND\"; naturopathic school was apparently not successful, did not survive -although he was \"high man for the state\" on state board exam, Nelson doesn't receive license until 10/35, when he turns 21 -Terrence J. Bennett DC (who signed Nelson's DC diploma) may have graduated from Oakland Chiropractic College or from SFCC; Bennett was already practicing his NeuroVascular Dynamics (NVD) in 1937 when Nelsonmoved practice into Bennett's office; NVD was derivative of Hurley & Saunder's (1932) Aquarian Age Healing; Bennett had come from New Mexico, may have been a baker; Bennett \"had the advantage of not having too much education\" which made him more inquiring; Nelson recalls that Bennett's bookcase was FULL _________________________________________ Papers by Ralph J.
