As someone who always assumes the worst, I thought the process would be a mess. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the vaccine site was very organized and everyone was patient. It was also great because I didn't have to leave my car to get either shot. After my first shot, I had a very sore arm but no other side effects. After my second, I had a sore arm plus some flu-like side effects. Luckily, nothing lasted more than 24 hours. What was it like when you got your vaccine? What was the process like? Did you have any side effects?

The first shot was a sore arm. The second shot was severe flue like tired symptoms. Couldn't walk far, hold head up, with fever. Lasted about a day. Three weeks after the second shot I experienced my first ever MG symptoms. Eating lunch I had difficulty chewing swallowing. The next morning I went to the gym and realized while warming up that I had lost all strength in my chest and shoulders. By the end of the day I was slurring and my head and neck felt like 100 lb weight was pulling it down. My symptoms progressed to where my diaphragm was being affected and breathing became difficult. Two weeks later after blood work, CAT scan and MRI results concluded MG. I will not be getting a booster. I'll never know if the jab gave me this terrible disease or not but it did wake it up. Unfortunately the medical field now looks at us as collateral damage to the cause and are willing to look away, hopefully not forever. - [joseph-betts](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/huntersr/)MemberDecember 30, 2021 at 9:47 pm I sure am sorry you developed MG. I already had MG and my first two Pfizer shots were like yours. First just a sore arm, second shot was flu like symptoms for about a day. But then I had a very bad MG flare up that took about six months to recover from. I did get the booster shot about eight months after the second shot but fortunately another flare up didn't follow the booster. You may want to consider getting the booster. I'd rather not contract Covid on top of having MG. - [quentin](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/quentinw/)MemberJanuary 4, 2022 at 11:20 am I feel your pain, I had my first Pfizer shot in September and 4 weeks after, and just before I was about to get my 2nd shot I have my first ever MG attack. My Neurologist says that I probably had it any way and now I should more than ever before have the second shot to protect my now compromised immune system. I however have serious doubts, my life is now changed forever and I feel a second shot could make me worse. And on top of having to come to terms with the nasty effects of this illness mentally and physically, I am now also restricted to where I can go, certain retail and I have lost friends over this. Our government is also in total denial that anyone is suffering from the vaccine's effects and have promoted a campaign of hate against the unvaccinated no matter what the reasons. - - - [deborah-whited](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/debsrosie/)MemberJuly 19, 2021 at 3:59 pm Hello, I received my 2 shots in March 2021. The 1st shot I was sick for 2 days and the 2nd shot I was sick for 4 days. It felt like the virus all over again. I had Covid-19 in January and was sick for 6 weeks. I went into the hospital for 5 days. I lost 15 lbs. My husband received his shots in March also. They didn't bother him except for a sore arm. He's always been the healthy one. He started having problems in June. He would choke a lot had trouble chewing and swallowing. He lost 25 lbs in 2 weeks. I finally got him into a doctor and he sent us to the emergency room. They ran a lot of tests and kept him for a week on IV. Still couldn't eat. They thought it was ALS. He got to come home with a feeding peg. I feed him 5-6 times a day. We went to a neurologist and he felt it was Myasthenia Gravis. Did the blood work and that's what it is. I believe and will never change my mind that this is because of the Covid 19 shots. He went from very, very healthy to having this damn disease. - [amy-cessina](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/cessina/)MemberAugust 24, 2021 at 11:06 pm I can believe the vaccine was the trigger for it.

I haven't been right since and hope I get back on track soon. - [samara](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/samaras/)MemberAugust 26, 2021 at 1:38 am Hi Deborah. It sounds like you and your husband are going through a really rough time, and the pandemic is making it even more confusing and scary. Your husband's symptoms sound a lot like what mine were like in the beginning. Just know that it gets much better once you know what's causing it. I was diagnosed in 2007. The first 6 months were the hardest, and then the treatments started to work and I gradually got back to living my life. It hasn't been perfect, but the treatments have been good enough to keep MG symptoms to a minimum. I've never heard of a vaccine causing MG. I don't think anyone knows what causes it. But I can see how the timing of your husband's symptoms would make you suspicious. I've long believed that extreme stress that I was going through in 2007 was the trigger that made my body go haywire. But autoimmune conditions run in my family, so my guess is that it was just a matter of time until I got MG anyway. I hope your husband starts to feel better soon. - [joseph-betts](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/huntersr/)MemberAugust 26, 2021 at 10:15 am Hi Samara, I was also diagnosed with MG in 2007.

Thanks for any advice. - [samara](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/samaras/)MemberAugust 28, 2021 at 7:57 pm Hi Joseph. For me, it has been a gradual process. In the beginning, I had a thymectomy and took high dose Prednisone. That stabilized me but was not a long term solution because of the side effects. Then, for a number of years, I was on both IVIG and azathioprine. Eventually, I upped the dose of azathioprine and was able to stop the IVIG. Now, I'm back down to a lower dose of azathioprine + mestinon as needed. It's working for now. - [joseph-betts](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/huntersr/)MemberAugust 28, 2021 at 11:23 pm Samara, thanks for sharing! - [jacqueline-marquiz](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/jacquiej63/)MemberSeptember 2, 2021 at 2:24 pm I'm so sorry to hear about your husband. This is why people shouldn't be running out and getting a vaccine that hasn't been in existence for more than 18 months. There's not enough history. I'm not an anti-VAXer, but I haven't received the vaccine yet as there is a lot of medication to help with COVID-19. I've myasthenia gravis for six years and I am three years post thymectomy. I take my health very seriously and I'm at the gym every day. I'm not a fan of medication but have to take it for both MG and Hashimoto's. I'm starting prednisone tomorrow for two weeks as my muscles are rapidly wasting. I was tested for LEMs MG but they came back negative. Good luck, fellow MGers.

My husband started symptoms approximately 30 days after his second dose. I would urge you to phone Pfizer and have them mail you their adverse event reporting form, and also to ask your doctor to report the vaccine - MG timeline to the CDC. As it's rare, to begin with, the more incidences that are reported, the better chance that this rare side effect is 'seen' in the data. This might lead to salary loss compensation and coverage for medical expenses if the association becomes clear. - [alan-bridle](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/alanb/)MemberJanuary 3, 2022 at 1:55 pm I took your suggestion to report my adverse event to Pfizer. using their on-line form. [COVID-19 Vaccine Side Effects & Adverse Events (pfizersafetyreporting.com)](https://www.pfizersafetyreporting.com/#/en) Unless our MG community reports incidences, I feel sure nothing about the interactions with MG will get studied. I would like to know why MG severity interacts with these vaccines, and I suspect that won't be looked into unless a lot of incidents like those mentioned in this forum are reported to the vaccine makers. - - [tom-tebault](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/tomtebault/)MemberNovember 30, 2021 at 1:55 am Hello, I was a healthy 58 yr old , a prostate cancer survivor, since 2015, an avid gym rat, yard working, house remodeling kinda guy. It all changed after my 2nd covid shot, Pfizer. I got the regular side effects, tiredness, headache etc., but my face drooped, my voice went hoarse around 4 pm and I was beat. Primary care doc was stumped. Referred to an ENT, he was stumped, and sent me to a Neurologist. After testing and research on my own, I was diagnosed with MG. I was crushed, I have not been the same since. If I had known the risks involved with the Pfizer vaccine, I would have never taken the shots. I firmly believe the shot gave me MG, I will not be taking the 3rd shot, or the 4th etc. etc. I am on Pyridostigmine 180 mg a day, it helps, but I'm still tired. I have a daily headache and nauseated, if I try to act like I used to, I pay for days after, like a hangover I didn't enjoy getting. I'm still early into this, since April, and the sadness consumes me. I realize I have to live life differently or find a better solution or drug therapy. My Neurologist is overwhelmed, with other patients, he does not specialize in MG. There is another Neurologist in my city who has more experience with MG, I booked an appointment in April of this year, to see him in April of 2022. Ridiculous. For now, I will continue to research, look for a more natural approach to treating this disease. The vaccine is not for everybody!!! - [joseph-betts](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/huntersr/)MemberNovember 30, 2021 at 2:35 am Hi Tom, I'm so sorry you have contacted MG. I was an active do it yourself guy until MG hit me when I was 52. I still tackle the big do it yourself projects but they have to be done in small increments with lots of rest in between. The Pfizer didn't give me MG but it did hugely increase symptoms for about six months after receiving the first two doses in February. - [ronald](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/anaussiemate/)MemberJune 2, 2022 at 2:10 am Tom, I was put on Lipitor 60 mg to lower cholesterol within 3 months I had MG this was back in 2015. I have not take Lipitor since. My MG continues I have had my second booster Pfizer and this time I have had symptoms for the last 4 days and I hope these will allow me to play tennis tomorrow which will be five days after the jab. my meds are 5 mg pred mestinon daily 60 mg 4 times a day and before I got Covid a month ago I was taking 500 Mg myfortic twice a day plus IVIG monthly and this has kept MG under control. when I got Covid I was asked to stop myfortic I was put on antiviral meds and this seemed to clear the Covid within 7-10 days and I remain off the myfortic as I feel well however I will talk to the neurologist today to confirm whether to restart myfortic mestinon gives me urine urgency and I now sleep with a bottle as night visits to toilet could be four or more times I now sleep with a apnea machine which makes a difference to frequencies as I feel that the constant waking is a trigger to urinate which if I am sleeping is less of an issue. I normally play tennis doubles 4 hours at least 4 times a week which I am very pleased about however the MG has caused the loss of strength in my monkey muscles in legs which means that I cant stand on toes or walk on heels which impacts on my running greatly. supplements include Vit D,astaxanthin.krill oil, CoQ10 Ubiquinol green tea low carbs and red meat Mediterranean diet plants fruit and veggies and reduced sugar I have spent many hours researching the net looking for reasons for this disease and natural cures and this continues with the hope that something will make a difference I am very grateful because I am doing most of the things that I want to do except that i have a lack of confidence to travel and be away from medical assistance as I have experienced a crisis something that makes me realise how this MG can impact on one's life. I feel that fresh air exercise sunlight and most importantly connecting with others to make you feel like you are still part of normal society and this has been my reason for keeping positive Thanks to all who share their stories as this is very reassuring knowing that this disease is not always the same for all people and we all react differently to meds it would be perfect if one day medical science would come up with an injection that would suppress the one antibody responsible for theMG rather than suppress the entire immune system. I have been given Retuximad which is a sledge hammer to the immune system meaning that the B cells are suppressed which are responsible for building new antibodies meaning that my response to the Covid vaccinations has been almost zero so I ask the question from the immunity Dept in the hospital what is the purpose of me having the vaccinations when I can't build a immune response and they simply don't know and continue to recommend to get the vaccinations which I have done. all the best everyone we all need to place our trust in something to help us and medical science seems to be acting to do this - - - [carrie-mcdade](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/mcmaori/)MemberJuly 19, 2021 at 10:28 pm I was vaccinated while taking 20 mg of prednisone per day on January 30 and March 4 With the Pfizer vaccine. Due to my immunocompromised state, I am not immunized even though I am vaccinated. A recent Covid antibody test result was negative, meaning I have no antibodies. After each of the shots, I had a slightly sore arm and that was it. According to Dr. Fauci, if you are sick after you get the vaccine that means your body is responding strongly to the antigen, producing antibodies. - [joseph-betts](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/huntersr/)MemberAugust 22, 2021 at 4:29 pm Has anybody experienced increased MG symptoms since receiving Covid-19 vaccines? In January my MG was doing pretty well on 20mg of prednisone/day. I got the Covid vaccines in February. The first vaccine was just a sore arm, the second resulted in fever, chills and bad flu like symptoms. By March my MG flared up really bad and all of the MG symptoms increased about ten fold and still remain that way.

I was pretty confused by the new guidance on 3rd shots. After talking to my doctor, I plan to get a 3rd shot later this week. My doctor said that the evidence shows that people taking immunosuppressants might not develop enough antibodies after only 2 shots and that this accounts for a lot of the \"breakthrough\" infections in vaccinated people. The CDC website has really good info on this for anyone who wants to read the new guidance. I'm really hoping the side effects from the 3rd shot aren't as bad as from the 2nd!

The new guidance suggesting that immunocompromised people need a 3rd shot is based on new research. Its unclear from your post how soon you started taking prednisone after getting that vaccine, but I suggest you ask your Dr whether you are supposed to get a third shot. Update on my 3rd shot: I got it yesterday. Still had flu-like symptoms, but not as bad as with the 2nd shot.

Could be coincidental, but I no longer stare side-eyed at those I know who are holding out on vaccine...I wouldn't get it again. My symptoms started with blurred and then double vision, progressed within a month to paralyzed soft palate, making my speech incoherent. My primary doctor and ENT had no idea what was happening, they never even mentioned MG and treated me for dry eye and acid reflux, even as symptoms got worse. As my breathing became affected, I became increasingly curious about MG, and honestly was desperate for an answer that wasn't ALS or MS, so I went to ER and asked about MG myself and getting AchR binding/bonding blood work. ER doc consulted with a neurologist and they agreed, and results came back very conclusively positive...still waiting for my neurologist to plant a flag on the diagnosis for some reason but she seems fairly convinced and started me on prednisone (30 MG a day, immediately resolved 90% of symptoms) and then pyridostigmine (180 MG a day). The pyridostigmine hasn't seemed to incrementally help and has immediately caused crazy leg cramps and spasms. It seems a big part of this condition is dialing in the right meds, so I'm staying on everything and trusting my new neurologist for now. A search on cramps and spasms is how I'd stumbled upon this group, great info here! Anyway, posting on this thread looking for others who've seen a connection between their MG onset and the vaccine. I have a few doctor friends who have told me they've seen neurological and autoimmune symptoms/conditions that started right after vaccine, but we'll likely never know for sure. - [joseph-betts](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/huntersr/)MemberOctober 22, 2021 at 10:41 am I'm so sorry to hear that you contracted MG after the Pfizer vaccines. I've had MG for about 14 years and had it somewhat under control. BUT, after my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine in February I had a bad MG flare up and haven't nearly recovered back to where I was in January. I can't handle the pyridostigmine either, it gives me terrible digestive problems. So far prednisone is about all I can tolerate but it's long term side affects are also terrible. Good luck! - [mike-anderson](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/oldguy63/)MemberNovember 19, 2021 at 9:41 pm I received moderna my last shot being April.

Every doctor who saw me was uneducated neurologically ... including three Banner neurologists. In my case, I lost 43 pounds in the first 6 months, searching for my disease. If your doctor does not have you on CELLCEPT, ask about it. The STEROID PREDNISONE IS REALLY NASTY .. so try to get tapered off that as soon as your doctor can do it. PREDNISONE sends your blood sugar to the roof ... and it is famous for causing MG patients to gain 40 to 60 pounds of weight gain. So you will gain much more than the 40 pounds you lost. Ask your neurologist for his expert opinion. - - [joe-b](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/jbohunis/)MemberDecember 25, 2021 at 1:35 am My experience is exactly like yours.

By August 1, 2021, they were both showing symptoms of autoimmune diseases. It was my sister who was diagnosed with gMG. Prior to vaccination, she was a completely healthy 47 y/o woman. Approximately 6-7 years ago she started cardio workouts 4-5 days a week due to being over 200lbs on a 5'5\" frame. She changed her eating habits to healthier options, gradually and successfully lost 25-30 lbs in that time frame. She worked full time and Mom of two very active teens. She initially presented with ocular symptoms (diplopia, ptosis, nystagmus), \"nerves in her head \"zapping\", and always feeling tired. She lost weight because she noticed she had difficulty swallowing. Sept 2021 she got to see a neurologist. (Mestinal 60mg was initially prescribed by the family MD. She only tolerated 2 days worth of medication before severe dizziness, diplopia, and tiredness presented.). Neuro MD restarted Mestinal 30mg twice daily, prednisone 10mg once daily. These meds had little effect on all of her symptoms. In fact, her symptoms seemed to change rapidly, usually the next week: worsening of vision, respiratory distress during the night, increase or decrease in saliva production respiratory distress upon walking one flight of stairs, 20 lb loss by the end of September. NeuroMD (in Sept 2021) ordered IVIG x 2 treatments which she finally received at beginning of Dec 2021 and showed no improvement even after 2.5wks. Fast forward to 21 Dec 2021 during a telephone appt NEURO MD ordered her to go to hospital ER due to an increase in gMG symptoms. CT SCANS, XRays, blood work normal. She was sent to MICU due to increasing Carbon levels in her lungs; ventilated via CPAP. PLEX treatments ordered: 5 treatments, two days apart. Received her fifth and final dose today. Internal medicine and thoracic surgery have been consulted and are now looking at surgery to remove her thymus. Has anyone else had an experience such as my sister's? How did you/family cope? I'm not feeling good about her prognosis. Many thanks. Caroline. - - [theresag](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/theresag/)MemberOctober 22, 2021 at 7:56 pm I was on 15 mg pred and 180 mg mestinon, somewhat controlling my seronegative MG. had 1 then 2nd Pfizer completed in February. I'm Somewhat comforted in hearing these stories as my MG exacerbated for the past 6 months. I was under great stress, moving remodeling , so attributed it to that. My response to vaccines were headache and feeling crummy for 1-3 days, nothing terrible. Have not had Covid. Husband received at same time and he had no reaction. 3rd shot. - I had no side effects, husband felt terrible headache, achy, for 3 - 4 days. makes one wonder how it affects anyone. That said I have spoken to 5 top doctors and all recommend the 3rd vaccine. Especially over 65 and being on prednisone. my husbands cardiologist told us that all the people at the hospital since summer that are being ventilated and or death. It is tragic any of you that acquired MG post vaccine. I'm curious if you have autoimmune in your family where it was dormant until the vaccine/Covid. My neuro has just bumped my prednisone to 20 mg. I get really bad side effects, so we will be starting IVIG in the next week or so. while this steps out of the subject, I would love to hear from any of you who have reduced MG symptoms and or remission after IVIG. I will be doing 2 days every 2 weeks. thanks - [barry-c](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/bac881/)MemberJune 18, 2022 at 3:18 pm Theresa, how did IVIG work for you, I start in a few weeks and hoping it's the key to getting off prednisone. - [theresag](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/theresag/)MemberJune 18, 2022 at 5:21 pm Barry, IVIG was not a huge success for me long term. I developed side effects that outweighed any benefit. i started VYVgart 2 months ago, which has been a game changer for me. So simple, and it really made my life nearly normal until the dreaded Covid came and me on a 2 week hiatus after my second cycle began. today I start again post Covid. Hoping it proves as beneficial once again. It was a slow improvement over the first 2 cycles.'I'm now down to 7 mg prednisone and may stay at 5. We will see. That will be 2-3 months down the road so it is a wait and see. Wish you good with IVIG. It helps many. - - - [theresag](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/theresag/)MemberOctober 22, 2021 at 8:05 pm I started on 2\u00d760 mg/day, then bumped to 3. I began the cramps in 2, then the Gastro issues at 3. I would try to go to 4, and that caused lots of gastro. my neuro recommended taking 1,1/2,1,1/2 etc. this helped. Now 4 months later, I'm able to take 3.5-4 a day, and do 1,1,1/2,1. On about the 3rd day the gastric issues kick in so I will skip a pill or extend it an hour. so for me a gradual approach and allowing my body to acclimate helps. I will still occasionally get cramping but not the jump out of bed ones in the middle of the night. during the summer, watermelon helped a lot! - [john-ulfelder](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/jculfsr/)MemberOctober 23, 2021 at 12:09 am I had my double Moderna rDNA vaccination in January and February at the local Fairfax County ealth Department offices. Had a sore arm for two days; no other side effects. Since I am on prednisone, I went to a Harris Teeter pharmacy for a Moderna booster (same dosage as each of the original shots) several weeks ago as soon as they were available. Had a sore arm for two days; no other side effects. I have always had a question about my level of immunity due to the fact that I had IVig treatment and plasmapheresis in April as part of my treatment for MG. I am concerned that the treatments may have weakened my coronavirus immunity, but there is not good way to find out (antibody tests are not reliable). MDs ae not able to say with any certainty. Thus, the booster. In addition, I recently received my annual flu shot as well. Generally, I think vaccines are an important tool for everyone. I have receeived vaccinations over the years for pneumonia (both vaccines), tetnus (DPT) every 10 years, Sbingrix (chicken pox) and depending on travel in the past Yellow Fever, Menningitis, Hepatitus C, etc. No serious reactions. - [alan-bridle](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/alanb/)MemberDecember 29, 2021 at 7:40 pm I had my initial shots of Pfizer mRNA vaccine in January and February 2021 before I was diagnosed with MG. I now realize that I had been having typical MG symptoms for several years, so my MG onset itself preceded the two vaccinations. In August 2021 I had emergency surgery to remove blood clots from my left leg, followed by intensive PT and OT in a rehab hospital with outpatient follow-up. I was doing really well in rehab until early September when sudden onset of extreme tiredness forced me to drop out of the rehab program. In October I began to experience orthopnea, insomnia and some difficulty breathing even while sitting in a chair. My oxygen saturation was barely over 90% for most of the day. My cardiologist was treating my symptoms as CHF, based on evidence that I had had a \"silent heart attack\" several years earlier ... but with no success. I was diagnosed with MG by a neurologist in late October but had been less than a week taking Mestinon when I went for a third shot of Pfizer vaccine as a booster. That may have been a major bad choice out of ignorance! I went into full myasthenia crisis a week later and ended up in an ICU on a ventilator for almost two weeks. My neurologist has since told me I was his second patient to have had rapidly worsening MG symptoms shortly after receiving an mRNA booster. I had five sessions of Plex while I was in the ICU and I am now on Mestinon, prednisone and outpatient IVIG. I am doing very much better with all my MG symptoms improving but it's unclear to me whether I have any increased immunity to COVID from the booster after Plex and IVIG. Perhaps only well stabilized MG patients should get booster shots because the immune system \"jolt\" from the booster runs counter to what our MG treatments try to do. It's not obvious to me what is the best strategy for MG patients in the face of the highly transmissible omicron COVID variant. - [jonathan-a](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/jonathan-a/)MemberJanuary 1, 2022 at 10:57 am I have had three MODERNA shots with the last one on Tuesday 12-28-2021. I have had no problems, except a sore right bicep for a day on the last one. I started having MG symptoms on 7-25-2019, was diagnosed 8 months later eventually on March 24, 2020. My undiagnosed MG was so bad, with eye problems and weak muscles and swallowing that I went to the hospital URGENT CARE on Feb 4th of 2020 and it took three hospitals and over four months to recover from being undiagnosed from MG and getting even worse. So I had MG before the CORONA VIRUS PLAGUE ever arrived from China, and did not get out of third hospital till 6-11-2020. From what I am finding out from these comments, it almost sounds like the vaccines may have brought forward and exposed your still dormant and undiagnosed Myasthenia Gravis illness, and you could have been having MG symptoms and fatigue earlier. I guess much more research and gathering of MG patients information and their medical storylines for every MG patient must be documented and maintained .... to help future research and a possible cure. It is also a possibility that if patients have had MG for a while ... before Covid arrived, maybe our MG meds, for some of us, unaffected by the shots, helped us have minor or no ill effects. - [amy-cessina](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/cessina/)MemberJanuary 2, 2022 at 12:28 am I had the booster shot and aside from arm pain, chills, and fatigue for a day I was fine. I can believe there are triggers for MG being viral illness and vaccines etc. I don't understand it completely but they say similarity with epitopes on acetylcholine receptor and virus. So mistakes it and makes the bad antibodies. My MG was triggered by a severe respiratory illness somewhat like covid but years before the pandemic. Strangely enough a man at my work visited his family in Wuhan China of all places and came back sick , came to work sick and coincidently spread a viral pneumonia to his coworkers (actually my entire department) including me. I got MG very rapidly after contracting this horrible virus which sickened me for 5 months and three hospital visits to recover from the virus let alone MG. - [quentin](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/quentinw/)MemberJanuary 4, 2022 at 12:13 pm I had my first Pfizer vaccine in September and 4 weeks after I had my first attack which has since been diagnosed as MG. I am now under a lot of pressure from doctors and friends to get a second shot, but I have serious doubts and it seems easy for people to give out this advice when they are not the ones in the line of fire. I am now taking Mestinone 4 times a day, and although my syptoms have improved, my eyesight is still not great and I struggle going outside in the daylight. My left arm and leg get tired easily, I have almost continuous leg spasms, and I suffer from acute fatigue. I have also developed tinnitus in my left ear which is constant. As an unvaccinated person (although I am single vaccinated) I can no longer enter any cafe or restaurant, cinema, barbers, public building or any business that chooses to bar unvaccinated people. My Neurologist refuses to even entertain the idea that there is any connection between vaccines and MG and the government has instigated a campaign of fear and hate. I now feel very uncertain about my future and find myself withdrawing from society everyday. - [wayne-eisen](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/wayneeisen/)MemberJanuary 6, 2022 at 5:15 am Hi Folks - There is so much misinformation about covid and the vaccines.

This is my husband's experience. We have reported it to Pfizer and to the public health authorities where we live. We believe so strongly in the necessity of being vaccinated for covid, we have kept this by and large to ourselves, even with the devastating consequences of developing this devastating autoimmune disease. I have not noted a single anti-vaxxer here. But people who accept the risks for the greater common good who are harmed, while rare, should be provided with proper financial and social supports. - - [wayne-eisen](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/wayneeisen/)MemberJanuary 6, 2022 at 5:14 pm Thank you, Diane, for your very thoughtful words. I totally agree that those who have suffered from the vaccine should be provided with proper financial and social supports. My ocular myasthenia was turned into Generalized Myasthenia Gravis from the interferon I was prescribed for another disease I had. I don't blame my doctor since I hadn't shared the fact that I was seeing double occasionally. Best wishes to you and your husband!

First couple days I had 2 IVIG which did nothing and in ICU I had 7 plasma exchange. Needless to say, I will not be getting anymore vaccines. Was also in hospital in June and September for MG exacerbations. It was a rough year. UTIs were the culprit for the other two. One serious which I probably got in hospital. Exploring all avenues of infection. just a note - last year I received the 2nd Pneumonia vaccine and short time later I ended up in hospital with pneumonia. I am really thankful that so any of you had good experiences - but that's not my story. I am 72 years old and it seems the best place for me is at home now.

Fourteen days later my right eye stopped tracking to the right, resulting in double vision. The neurologist treated it as an MG exacerbation and we increased my Prednisone dosage from 7.5mg a day to 30mg a day. That had no affect so he prescribed two courses of IVIG, which also had no impact. I then lost all sense of smell and taste, a condition that has recovered, but only intermittently. Neither the neurologist nor a Neuro-ophthalmologist would attribute the exacerbation to the vaccine, simply recording it as an MG exacerbation. I have had ocular MG since 1974 and have had many exacerbations during that time, but never like this one. Oddly enough, while in the ER for another reason, the double vision and the right eye tracking returned to normal. I have since managed to reduce the Prednisone dosage back to 10mg/day. - [phyllis-scullion](https://myastheniagravisnews.com/forums/members/nozyupdate2/)MemberFebruary 23, 2022 at 3:54 pm I have had MG for just over 7 yrs I had 1st AZ jab in feb 21 severe flu like symptoms nausea and vomiting for 24hrs settled and back to normal after 3 days. 2nd AZ mild flu like symptoms for 24 hrs. 3rd Jab with Pfizer severe flu like symptoms and mild nausea less sever than with 1st AZ settled in 72hrs. 4th jab with Pfizer mild flu like symptoms for 24hrs. Overall I would say it had no obvious impact om my MG possibly more fatigued than usual but fluctuating fatigue is \"normal\" for me. Although I had 2 bad experiences with side effects it did not dissuade me from having vaccination for me the risk of unknown outcome of getting covid 19 infection was the main driver of having vaccinations.
