Beaty, Gorman, MD, MPH, MPH, and Allison Kempe, MD, MPH Introduction: In June 2019, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended shared clinical decision making (SCDM) regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for adults 27 to 45 years. Our objectives were to assess among primary care physicians 1) recent practice regard- ing HPV vaccination for adults 27 to 45 years, 2) knowledge of HPV and the new SCDM recommenda-tion, and 3) attitudes toward and anticipated effect of the new SCDM recommendation. Methods: From October to December 2019, we administered an Internet and mail survey to national networks of 494 general internist (GIM) and 474 family physician (FP) members of the AmericanCollege of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians, respectively. Results: Response rate was 64% (617/968; GIM, 57%; FP, new ACIP recommendation; 42% had recommended HPV vaccination to adults 27 to 45 years, butmost had administered HPV vaccine to very few of these patients (73% to 0% and 22% to 1 to 3). Fifty- ve percent and 63% were unaware that HPV vaccination does not prevent progression of existing HPV- related cancers or infections, respectively and 57% were not sure what to emphasize when having aSCDM conversation about HPV vaccination. A majority reported they will be more likely recommend HPV vaccination to adults in the 27-to-45-year age range as a result of the new recommendation. Conclusions: Physicians are interested in recommending HPV vaccination for adults age 27 to 45 years despite ACIP not routinely recommending it in this age range. The majority need more educa-tion about the optimal use of HPV vaccine in this age group. ( J Am Board Fam Med 2021;34:162-170.)

Downloaded from protects against HPV types that cause 90% of geni- tal warts and 92% of HPV-related cancers.3Until recently, 9vHPV was only licensed for use in ado- lescents and young adults less than 27 years.4-7 However, some men and women remain at risk for new HPV infections throughout their sexually active lives and HPV vaccines have been shown to be immunogenic in men age 27 to 45 years and to prevent persistent infection and HPV-related pre- cancerous lesions in women age 27 to 45 years.8-13 Countries have had different approaches in termsof licensing HPV vaccines and recommending HPV vaccination in this age range. For example,although China, Australia, Canada, and many European countries have licensed HPV vaccines through age 45 years, their national immunization programs have targeted younger age groups; out- side of targeted groups, vaccination costs are either not covered or incompletely covered by national health insurance programs. 14-16 In October 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration expanded the licensed age range for 9vHPV in the United States from 9 to 26 years to 9 to 45 years.17In June 2019, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) didnot extend the recommendation for catch-up HPVvaccination to include adults age 27 to 45 years, but instead, noting that some adults who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infections and might bene t from vaccination in this age range, recommended shared clinical deci-sion making (SCDM) regarding potential HPV vac- cination. 18Most health insurance should cover the cost of vaccination that occurs as a result of SCDM recommended by ACIP, under provisions of the Affordable Care Act.19Formal publication of these recommendations in August 2019 included 8 talkingpoints for physicians to consider when having a SCDM conversation with adults age 27 to 45 years about receiving HPV vaccination, including epide- miology of HPV infections and disease, vaccine ef - cacy and effectiveness in various age groups, characteristics of HPV vaccines including their expected prophylactic rather than therapeutic effects, and that no antibody test is available to determine whether someone is still susceptible to HPV infections that the vaccination can prevent. 18 Previous surveys of predominately insured American women in this age range have found that most would choose to receive HPV vaccination if it was approved for use in this age range.20,21Because a physician recommendation has been identi ed as an important predictor of receipt of vaccinations among adults in general22-25and HPV vaccination in particular,26the objectives of this study were to assess among US primary care physi- cians 1) recent practice regarding HPV vaccination in adults age 27 to 45 years, 2) knowledge of HPVand the new SCDM recommendation, and 3) atti- tudes toward and anticipated effect of the new SCDM recommendation. Methods Study Setting From October 2019 to January 2020, a survey was administered to a national network of physicians who spent at least 50% of their time practicing pri- mary care. The human subjects review board at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus approved this study as exempt research. Study Population The Vaccine Policy Collaborative Initiative, a sur- vey entity to assess physician practice and attitudesabout vaccines and vaccine policy, working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, devel- oped and conducted the survey among physician networks designed to be representative of the American College of Physicians and the AmericanAcademy of Family Physician memberships. 27-28 These physician networks are similar to physiciansrandomly sampled from the American Medical Association Master le with respect to demo- graphics and attitudes regarding vaccines. 27 Study Design The survey asked about whether HPV vaccines were stocked in the practice, and about physician behavior regarding recommending the vaccine for various groups of adults age 27 to 45 years: 1) healthy adults, 2) those with an immunocomprom-ising condition, 3) those with a new sex partner, 4) those who have multiple sex partners, 5) those in a mutually monogamous sexual relationship, and 6) men who have sex with men. The survey assessed frequency in the past 3 months patients in this agerange had requested always/always \"0,\"\"1t o3 , \"\"4 to 9, \"and \"10 or more \"). Physicians were asked about the types of patients age 27 to 45 years who doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2021.01.200408 Physicians 'Viewpoints on HPV Vaccination for Adults 163copyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from had requested it (worried adults who have low risk for HPV-related disease, adults at high risk forHPV-related disease, adults who are planning to have a new sex partner, and adults who already have an HPV-related infection or disease). Physicians were presented with a series of true and false questions aimed to assess knowledge ofHPV disease and vaccination and including a \"do- not-know \"response option. Four-point Likert scales were used to assess physician attitudes regarding HPV vaccination for adults age 27 to 45 years (\" strongly agree \"to\"strongly disagree \"). Physicians were provided the following informa- tion: The ACIP did not recommend routine catch-up vaccination for adults age 27 to 45 years. However, because some adults in this age range are at risk for new HPV infection and might bene-t from vaccination, ACIP recommended SCDM for these individuals, and the survey asked aboutprior awareness of this recommendation. Physicians were then asked how the new recommendation affects how they will recommend HPV vaccinationto adults in this age range in the future, with 3 response options ( \"I will be less likely to recom- mend, \"\"My recommendation will not change, \" and \"I will be more likely to recommend \"). A national advisory panel of general internists (GIM) (n = 3) and family physicians (FP) (n = 4) pretested the survey, which was then modi ed based on feed- back. The survey was then pilot tested among 60GIM and 8 FP nationally and further modi ed based on their feedback. Survey Administration Per individual physician preference, the survey was sent by e-mail or through US mail. The e-mail group was sent an initial e-mail and up to 8 e-mail reminders, and the US mail group was sent an ini- tial mailing and up to 2 additional reminders.Nonrespondents in the e-mail group were also sent up to 2 surveys by US mail. Due to an initial low response rate, GIM nonresponders received an additional reminder in a hand-written envelope. 28 The mail protocol was patterned on Dillman 's Tailored Design Method.29The survey was admin- istered 4 months after the ACIP vote in June 2019 and 2 months after formal publication of the rec- ommendation for SCDM regarding HPV vaccina- tion of adults age 27 to 45 years.18Statistical Analysis Results were similar by specialty so are presented together, with signi cant differences highlighted. Respondents and nonrespondents were compared on all available characteristics using t-test, chi- squared tests, and Wilcoxon tests, as appropriate. Chi-squared tests were used to compare responses over all response categories between specialties andto assess the potential associations between knowl- edge of the new ACIP recommendation and having recommended HPV vaccination in the past. Chi- squared tests and Fisher exact tests were used to compare physicians who had and who had not rec-ommended HPV vaccination to adults age 27 to 45 years in the past and likelihood of doing so based on the new ACIP recommendation. All analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Results The overall response rate was 64% (617/968); 71% (336/474) for FP and 57% (281/494) for GIM. Characteristics of respondents and nonrespondents are shown in Table 1. Respondents and nonres- pondents did not differ by census location (urban,suburban, or rural), region, or whether decisions regarding purchasing and handling of vaccines by the practice were made independently or at a larger system level. Male and older physicians and physi- cians from private and smaller practices were lesslikely to respond. Recent Practice Regarding HPV Vaccination for Adults Age 27 to 45 Years Seventy-four percent of respondents reported that 9vHPV was stocked in their practice (FP, 83% and GIM, 64%; P <.0001 for difference cialties). Forty-two percent of physicians had rec-ommended HPV vaccination to adults age 27 to45 years in the past; 35% to adults with multiple sex partners, 33% to men who have sex with men, 29% to adults with a new sex partner, 27% to adults with an immunocompromising condition, and 15% to adults in a mutually monogamous sexual relation-ship. Seventy-three percent had not administered HPV vaccine to any adult in this age range in the past 3 months; 22% had administered to 1 to 3 patients, 4% to 4 to 9 patients, and only 1% had administered to >10 patients. 164JABFM January -February 2021 Vol. 34 No. 1 http://www.jabfm.orgcopyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from Discussion This is the rst study to evaluate the physician per- spective on the new ACIP recommendation regard- ing HPV vaccination for adults age 27 to 45 years. Although the data show that nearly half of physi-cians had recommended HPV vaccination to anadult in this age group, most had not yet adminis- tered it in the several months after the new recom- mendation was made and published. Fifty-eightpercent of physicians knew of the SCDM recom- mendation and knowledge of this recommendation was associated with having recommended HPVvaccination to an adult in this age range. The vast majority of surveyed physicians, regardless of their previous practices regarding adults in this agerange, reported the new recommendation would increase their likelihood of recommending HPV vaccination to adults age 27 to 45 years. The majority of physicians were knowledgeable about other aspects of HPV vaccination recommen- dations (Table 2); however, some were not aware the vaccination series can be completed with9vHPV even if initiated with another HPV vaccine, the recommended series for adults initiating vaccina- tion is 3 doses, and that antibody testing is not recom-mended. FPs were slightly more knowledgeable thanGIM about other vaccination recommendations, likely as a result of caring for adolescents for whom there has been a longstanding routine recommendation forHPV vaccination. Gaps in knowledge of HPV disease and vaccina- tion identi ed here indicate physicians may be overestimating the bene ts of HPV vaccination for some populations. Although HPV vaccination is highly effective when given before rst exposure to HPV, HPV vaccination does not prevent the pro- gression of existing HPV infections or disease. 30,31 The nding that only 38% of physicians knew HPV vaccine does not prevent the progression ofHPV infection are in contrast to a 2010 study of Australian primary care physicians which showed almost all (95%) were aware of this. 32In addition, many physicians were not aware HPV vaccineeffectiveness is lower in adults age 27 to 45 years than in younger individuals. Because many adults have already been exposed to HPV, vaccine effec-tiveness is lower with increasing age. Thus, the public health bene t of HPV vaccination over age 26 years is expected to be minimal. 18 Knowledge gaps among physicians may make it challenging for them to have a SCDM conversationwith adults about HPV vaccination and likelyFigure 1.

Downloaded from contribute to physicians being unsure of what to emphasize during such conversations. There areseveral other factors to consider as well. First, to inform a SCDM conversation, physicians need to ascertain sexual history. Although sexual history taking by primary care physicians has not been extensively studied, at least one study, conducted before any ACIP HPV vaccination recommenda- tions, indicated that almost half of physicians did not take a sexual history as part of an annual exami- nation; very few physicians asked about sexual his-tory during every visit. 33Second, it is inherently difcult to know which adults might bene tf r o m HPV vaccination because this depends on both past and future exposures to vaccine-type HPV through sexual activity. This may be one reason why physi- cians, particularly those who had previously recom- mended HPV vaccination for adults in this age range, did not make speci c distinctions in their recommendations to various risk groups. Third, SCDM conversations may be viewed as potentially time-consuming, a challenge when there are time constraints during a primary care visit as the com- plexity and number of tasks for physicians to address per visit has increased.34,35 Our ndings suggest most physicians plan to recommend HPV vaccination to at least some adults in this age group. The ACIP recommenda- tion states, \"HPV vaccination does not need to be discussed with most adults aged >26 years. \"18This is an important consideration as there is a globalHPV vaccine shortage. 36The focus should remain on vaccinating adolescent and young adult popula-tions who are most likely to bene t; to date, the US HPV vaccination program, targeting these youngergroups, has been successful at reducing vaccine- type HPV infections and related diseases 37and has been cost effective and potentially even cost sav-ing. 38Extending vaccination to all adults age 27 to 45 years is predicted to have little impact on mor- bidity and mortality, resulting in considerably less favorable cost effectiveness ratios than vaccinating younger populations.39 Although this survey includes nationally repre- sentative samples of primary care physicians who care for adults in the United States and the response rate was high, the ndings are subject to several limitations. Males; older physicians; andphysicians from smaller, private practices are some- what underrepresented in these ndings and thus may limit the generalizability of the results. Theremay be an element of social desirability bias in terms of physicians reporting they will recommend this vaccine even though the survey included infor-mation stating that ACIP does not routinely recom- mend HPV vaccination for adults. The report of likelihood of vaccinating may not translate intoactually vaccinating, and the number of adults anticipated to be vaccinated could not be quanti ed from the survey. In addition, we did not ask physi- cians speci cally about having a SCDM conversa- tion about HPV vaccination. Primary care physicians, key stakeholders in the acceptability of HPV vaccination among adults 27to 45 years, expressed great interest in vaccinating this age-group against HPV, despite the lack of a routine recommendation from ACIP. Addressingknowledge de cits identi ed in this survey could assist physicians in implementing a recommenda-tion for SCDM with their patients. Developmentof a decision aid, which has been suggested to improve the quality of SCDM, 40may be helpful in prompting physicians to assess relevant patient his- tory, to cull the 8 talking points provided in theACIP recommendation, and clearly convey knowl- edge concepts and thus support physicians having conversations with adults age 27 to 45 years aboutHPV vaccination.
