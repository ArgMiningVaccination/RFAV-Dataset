FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION -2- A. Executive Orders and Definitions The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as other federal government agencies/departments as part of a government -wide effort, are working to address environmental, public health, and energy challenges affecting communities, and specifically those adversely and disproportionately affected by environmental, climate, and human health harms and risks. This includes communities historically underserved and adversely impacted by persistent poverty, inequality, and lack of funding/resources. In furtherance of this effort, this RFA is being issued to support Executive Order 13985 , Advancing Racial Equity And Support For Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government, issued on January 20, 2021, which expressed Administration policy that the f ederal government should pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all, including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, a nd adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality . The Executive Order defines \"underserved communities \" as \"populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life...\". As described further in the Executive Order, \" underserved communities\" include communities such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, r (LGBTQ+) with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. For purposes of this RFA, \"underserved communities\" has the meaning set forth in Executive Order 1 3985 and includes \"environmentally overburdened communities\" (that is, communities adversely and disproportionately affected by environmental, climate and human health harms and risks including remote, rural, and urban communities), and disadvantaged communities. This RFA also supports Executive Order 14008 , Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, issued on January 27, 2021, which deepened the Administration's commitment to advancing environmental justice by creating the Justice40 Initiative. The Justice40 Initiative establishes a goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments\u2014including those in climate change; clean energy and energy efficiency; clean transit; affordable and sustainable housing; training and workforce development; the remediation and reduction of legacy pollution; and the development of critical clean water infrastructure \u2014flow to disadvantaged communities. Increased technical assistance and community engagement of disadvantaged communities was included as a benefit under Justice40 per the Interim Implementation Guidance for the Justice40 Initiative (M-21-28). \"Environmental justice\" as defined by the EPA is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. Fair treatment means that no one group of people, including racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic groups, should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences -3- resulting from industrial, municipal, and commercial operations or the execution of federal, state, local, and tribal environmental programs and po licies. Meaningful involvement means that: People have an opportunity to participate in decisions about activities that may affect their environment and/or health; The public's contribution can influence the regulatory agency's decision; Community concerns will be considered in the decision-making process; and Decision makers will seek out and facilitate the involvement of those potentially affected. \"Energy jus tice\" as defined by the Department of Energy (DOE or Department ) is \"the goal of achieving equity in both the social and economic participation in the energy system, while also remediating social, economic, and health burdens on those disproportionately harmed by the energy system\" (Initiative for Energy Justice, 2019). At its core, energy justice applies the basic principles of civil rights to the climate space 1. Environmental justice and energy justice are based on the same equitable principles providing EPA and DOE an opportunity to further their common goals and core missions through this RFA. B. Back ground and O bjectives The missio n of the EPA is to protect human health and the environment for all people with an emphasis on assisting those communities adversely and disproportionately affected by environmental, climate , and human health harms and risks. EPA, as illustrated by the funding provided under the Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act (IIJA) and annual appropriations, intends to make significant investments in the health, equity, and resilience of these, and all communities, to address past, current, and future environmental health and justice challenges. To maximize these significant investments, new and innovative strategies and approaches for issues such as community engagement and participation in environmental programs, equitable distribution of financial resources, capacity -building and outreach, and technical assistance and training to enhance access to financial assistance 2 opportunities and promote effective grants management and performance, are necessary especially for underserved communit ies that have, and continue to be, plagued by environmental pollution and health, and environmental justice, challenges. One such strategy is to cooperate with other federal agencies whose mission also includes addressing these types of objectives, such as DOE , which has an added focus on energy justice as noted above. The DOE Equity Action Plan, released in April 2022, is designed to ensure that DOE eliminates barriers to access, and transforms programs and policies to open even broader 1 How Energy Justice, Presidential Initiatives, and Executive Orders Shape Equity at DOE | Department of Energy 2 Financial assistance includes grants and cooperative agreements. Cooperative agreements will be awarded under this RFA , but the terms are used interchangeably in the RFA . -4- pathways for under- represented groups, including underserved communities, to access DOE resources. Cooperating with EPA to advance shared environmental and energy justice goals furthers DOE 's programmatic mission and its commitment to embed equity in its work through all initiatives consistent with the Justice40 Initiative. EPA and DOE intend that the awards to be made under this RFA will be an integral component of government- wide collaborative efforts to support partners with capacity constraints, including underserved communities and rural/remote communities, in accessing federal resources and funding sources, and engaging in decision-making processes to address environmental and energy justice challenges. Historically, underserved communities have been d isproportionately burdened by environmental hazards and health consequences and have faced environmental and energy justice challenges. These communities are often exposed to unhealthy land uses, poor air and water quality, dilapidated housing, lead exposure, and other environmental threats that drive health disparities. Many of these communities are also surrounded by social inequities such as job insecurity, underemployment, linguistic isolation, underperforming schools, noise pollution, crowded homes, face high energy burden or fossil fuel dependence, and lack access to healthy foods and transportation. In addition, they often lack adequate resources and experience to navigate complex grant application and award making processes and have been limited in their ability to have meaningful access to, and participation in, governmental decision-making processes that affect them, including those relating to environmental health and justice , and energy justice. The combination of environmental risks and social inequities creates a cumulative, disproportionate impact that hinders optimal environmental health and justice particularly for these communities. C onsistent with EPA's mission and Administration priorities, including those set forth in Executive Orders 13985 and 14008, and using funding available for environmental justice, as well as potential DOE funding to be provided through an interagency agreement, and other potential funding as available and appropriate , EPA is seeking applications from eligible entities as described in Section III to establish and operate Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Technical Assistance Centers (EJ TCTAC) . The EJ TCTACs will provide technical assistance, training, and other eligible forms of assistance, resources, and support ( henceforth referred to as \"Eligible Services \"), as described below, to \"program participants (as used throughout this RFA) \" including but not limited to: Nonprofit organizations Community -based and grassroots organizations Philanthropic and civic organizations Underserved communities and organizations Rural and Remote communities and organizations Faith -based organizations and churches Educational institutions ( e.g., schools, colleges, and universities), including Minority Serving Institutions Individuals of underserved communities Disadvantaged Businesses Local, tribal, and state governmental units US Territories -5- Utility providers Health care providers and clinics Wh ile the cooperative agreements expected to be awarded under this RFA are part of a multifaceted approach to benefit all communities facing environmental and energy justice challenges, EPA and DOE are especially interested in the EJ TCTACs provid ing Eligible Services to program participants in underserved communities, in rural and remote areas , and to those with the highest degree of burden and capacity constraints. EJ TCTAC s will serve as a resource for program participants interested in participating in environmental and energy justice programs and policy development and understanding and utilizing environmental and energy grant programs to advance environmental and energy j ustice. In sum, the purpose of the cooperative agreements to be awarded under this RFA is to provide program participants with Eligible Services such as: Guidance, information, and technical assistance to identify and address environmental and energy justice needs and challenges in their community. Local environmental justice analyses and the ability to identify environmental justice issues and challenges that need to be addressed such as disposal of so lid and hazardous wastes. Assistance and training resulting in a strengthened ability to identify, successfully apply for, and effectively manage grants related to environmental and energy justice Assistance in navigating government systems used in the grant process such as www.sam.gov, www.grants.gov, EERE Exchange , and OCED Exchange . Knowledge and understanding of environmental and energy justice -related grant programs and how they can be used to help underserved communities address environmental health, pollution, and justice challenges. Assistance to facilitate community engagement and partnership building to address environmental and energy justice issues. Translation and interpretation services with respect to grant program awareness and application, award, and management process es to provide program participants a meaningful opportunity to participate in environmental and energy justice efforts Knowledge and understanding of federal, state, local, and private foundation grant laws, regulations, policies, procedures, and programmatic requirements , to facilitate understanding of complex grant award making and management processes to enhance their ability to effectively perform and manage grants. Assistance and training to have an increased ability to meaningfully participate in decision-making related to environmental and energy justice challenges to ensure that their perspectives, experiences, and expertise inform policy development and program design and delivery at all levels of government and with the private sector ; and Assistance to build capacity, including strengthening human capital to focus on environmental justice and energy justice issues and fostering third -party \"community champions\" (e.g., community advocates and volunteer leaders) to engage in decision-making p rocess so they will be in a strengthened position to participate in environmental and energy justice programs and address related challenges. -6- By increasing program participants, particularly underserved and rural/remote communities, access to and awareness of grant opportunities, knowledge of the grant application and management process, understanding of financing sources and grant requirements, and the ability to participate and engage in environmental and energy justice decision -making, they will be better positioned to advance and address environmental and energy justice issues nation -wide. This w ill lead to progress towards achieving the objectives of Executive Orders 13985 and 14008. EPA and DOE also recognize that it is important to engage all available minds to address the environmental and energy justice challenges the nation faces. Accordingly, both agencies want to expand the environmental and energy conversation by including members of communities which may not have previously participated in such dialogues to participate in this technical assistance program. For this reason, EPA and DOE strongly encourage all eligible applicants identified in Section III, including Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs ), as well as university business schools and business programs, to apply under this opportunity. For purposes of this RFA, the following are considered MSIs: 1. Historically Black Colleges and Universities, as defined by the Higher Education Act (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1061(2)). A list of these schools can be found at Historically Black Colleges and Universities . 2. Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), as defined by the Higher Education Act (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1059c(b)(3) and (d) (1)). A list of these schools can be found at American Indian Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities . 3. Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), as defined by the Higher Education Act (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101a(a)(5)). A list of these schools can be found at Hispanic- Serving Institutions . 4.

Authority Congr ess provided EPA with both funding and expanded authority to further environmental justice through financial assistance programs in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (Public Law 117-103), which provided funding for environmental justice implementation and training grants. EPA also has statutory authority to award cooperative agreements for technical assistance for environmental and /or energy justice activities under Section 103 of the Clean Air Act, Section 104 of the Clean Water Act, and Section 8001 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. In order to receive Section 8001 funding, applicants must speci fically address in their applications how they will perform training and public education activities to address environmental harms -7- caused by solid and hazardous wastes. EPA interprets the term \"training\" in these statutes to include technical assistance. DOE has authority to enter into cooper ativ e agreements and other similar transactions that support its functions and missions under Section 646 of the DOE Organization Act of 1977, and, further, to advance clean energy initiatives and related activities under but not limited to the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and the IIJA. Potential DOE funding toward s the awards under this RFA is authorized under the IIJA and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022. Additional and future funding for awards under this RFA is contingent on the availability of future appropriations. D. Technical Assistance, Training, and Support Activities The awar ds under this RFA will be for the establishment and operation of EJ TCTAC s, with a physical location or a virtual/technological presence, providing the technical assistance, training, and other eligible forms of support summarized above (the Eligible Services ), and more fully described below. Consistent with the objectives of thi s RFA, applicants should describe in their applications and workplan (See Section IV), and will be evaluated based on, the type of Eligible Services they will provide, how they will do so, and how program participants, and especially underserved communities and rural and remote communities, will be made aware of, and can access, the Eligible S ervices. Applicants are strongly encouraged to design their EJ TCTAC to provide the types of Eligible Services described below to meet the objectives of this RFA. The Eligible Services to be provided by recipients operating EJ TCTAC s should be based on accomplishing the following objectives to assist program participants, with a special emphasis on underserved communities and rural and remote communities, with information, tools, and assistance : To identify potential grant opportunities (e.g., federal, state, local, or private) related to environmental protection, health, and justice, and energy justice, and subaward (including loans under revolving loan funds) and procurement opportunities under those grants 3 On applying for grants related to environmental protection, health, and justice, and energy justice, preparing applications responsive to competitive solicitations, and effectively managing grants from an administrative and programmatic perspective - See Section I.E for limitations on this service.

Consistent with these parameters, applicants should design their EJ TCTAC to provide, at a minimum, the Eligible Services described below . Applicants may also propose approaches to addressing each area and service that differs from or supplements what is described below and may propose other types of technical assistance activities that meet the objectives of this RFA in the geographic area(s) they propose to serve as long as the activities are eligible for funding under the appropriate authorities. Priority should be placed on ensuring that efforts are made to make undeserved communities, communities in remote and rural areas, and program participants with the highest degree of burden and capacity constraints, aware of the EJ TCTAC s and how to access their services. 1. Outreach Efforts Applicants should describe their plan and approach to make program participants, particularly underserved communities, communities in remote and rural areas, and program participants with the highest degree of burden and capacity constraints, aware of their EJ TCTAC and the Eligible Services they intend to provide. Information disseminated through outreach efforts should include at a minimum: a. T he types of Eligible Services to be offered to program participants. b. I nstructions on how to access the Eligible Services in a user- friendly and expeditious manner, including in the predominate local language(s). c. I nformation about events, including workshops, seminars, or other training, that the EJ TCTAC plans to offer or participate in that may benefit program participants. A pplicants should design their outreach efforts to reach the widest possible audience and are expected to significantly invest in outreach to underserved communities , communities in remote and rural areas, and to program participants with the highest degree of burden and capacity constraints, in their geographic areas. In doing so, they should be building strong local partnerships, allocating resources to employee, contractor, and program participant travel for outreach activities, and creating awareness of the assistance, training, and suppo rt/resources to be offered by their EJ TCTAC through social media and/or other types of outreach mechanisms. 4 4 Refer to EPA Guidance on Participant Support Costs for information on the allowability of costs for program participant travel and stipends. -9- 2. Grant Technical Assistance, Training, Support, and Engagement Applicants should demonstrate how they will provide program participants, particularly underserved communities , communities in remote and rural areas, and program participants with the highest degree of burden and capacity constraints, with Eligible Services on environmental protection, health, and justice programs, and energy justice programs, and how to participate in them, apply for funding under them, and effectively manage grants administratively and programmatically. This may include but is not limited to assistance with environmental justice issues under air , water, energy, and solid and hazardous waste programs. Applicants should describe how they will provide these services to program participants through the most efficient and effective means practic able and how they will provide translation and other int erpretive services to make this assistance available to those not fluent in English or that have limited English proficiency. In providing the Eligible Services under this RFA , applicants should design an approach intended to assist program participants w ith assistance and information on: a. How to m eaningfully engage with governmental decisionmakers and the private sector to ensure that their perspectives, experiences, and expertise inform policy development and program design and delivery on environmental and energy justice issues including issues relating to energy generation, energy efficiency, and solid and hazardous w aste treatment, storage , and disposal facilities. b. How to f ind and approach grant and program offices for information, and grantees for contract or subaward opportunities available under grants, to further environmental and energy justice. c. How to i dentify, understand, and analyze financing options to pursue projects that meet environmental and energy justice needs in a manner that minimizes duplication of effort with other federally funded programs. d. How to p repare and submit applications for grants for environmental and energy justice projects including helping program participants understand the requirements of competitive solicitations and how to prepare a responsive application to a solicitation - See Section I.E. for limitations on this activity . e. How to r egister, properly use, and access information from government grant systems, including but not limited to the System for Award Management (SAM) 5 at www.sam.gov, Grants.gov at www.grants.gov, EERE Exchange , and OCED Exchange . f. Understanding and complying with administrative and programmatic post- award grant functions and responsibilities and federal grant regulations (e.g., 2 CFR Part 200, as adopted and amended by 2 CFR Part 910 and 2 CFR Part 1500, 2 CFR Part 35, 40 CFR Part 35) as well as applicable st ate regulations and private funding governance. g. Any other activities they believe will be effective in providing technical assistance, training, and support to program participants, and especially underserved , rural, and remote communities, to facilitate their participation in funding programs for 5 This includes the Entity Information and Assistance Listings sections of SAM.gov. -10- environmental and energy justice and in the environmental and/or energy decision- making process. 3. Community Collaboration, Facilitation, and Engagement Services Appli cants should des ign their EJ TCTAC to have the capability to help program participants facilitate meetings with local stakeholders, build partnerships and coalitions, and develop sustainable partnerships with other program participants and stakeholders to advance environm ental and energy justice. Collaborations, and relationships with program participants, and especially underserved communities and communities in rural and remote areas, are essential to sustainable and effective community work. This includes coordination and/or facilitation services and similar activities for meetings and communications between program participants/underserved , rural and remote communities/other environmental and energy justice stakeholders (e.g., community champions, such as advocates and volunteer leaders, local governmental officials, community groups) to address and discuss environmental protection and justice concerns, energy justice issues, and inform program and policy development and implementation. This approach to collaborations can also include a cohort approach (e.g., supporting communities with shared objectives and/or characteristics as a group through delivering curated capacity building, training, peer learning and support). This activity may also require performing analyses, and preparing reports, identifying environmental justice needs and challenges affecting certain communities and proposing recommendations to address them. 4. EJ TCTAC Geographic Coverage and Coordination As s tated in Section II, EPA intends to award between 5 -10 cooperative agreements under this RFA for approximately up to $10,000,000 each. Applicants can submit up to three applications under this RFA so long as each one describes the geographic area coverage of the ir proposed EJ TCTAC (see below) , is separately submitted through www.grants.gov , and each application is for a different geographic area(s ) or combination of geographic area(s) (e.g., an applicant cannot submit three applications for regional geographic area #1). A single application can cover more than one regional geographic area ( for example, a single application can cover regional geographic area s 1, 2, and 3). If an applicant submits more than 3 applications, EPA staff will contact the applicant to identify which 3 applications EPA will consider. If an applicant submits multiple applications and is selected for multiple awards, EPA may , if appropriate, combine those selections into one award (See Section VI .D). Any questions about submitting multiple applications should be directed to the contact identified in Section VII prior to application submission. The geographic areas are: Regional Geographic Area #1 includes EPA Region 1 (CT, ME, MA, NH, RI, VT) Regional Geographic Area #2 includes EPA Region 2 (NJ, NY, PR, VI) Regional Geographic Area #3 includes EPA Region 3 (DE, DC, MD, PA, VA, WV) Regional Geographic Area #4 includes EPA Region 4 (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) Regional Geographic Area #5 includes EPA Region 5 (IL, IN, MI, MN, OH, WI) Regional Geographic Area #6 includes EPA Region 6 (AR, LA, NM, OK, TX) -11- Regional Geographic Area #7 includes EPA Region 7 (IA, KS, NE, MO) Regional Geographic Area #8 includes EPA Region 8 (CO, MT, ND, SD, UT, WY) Regional Geographic Area #9 includes EPA Region 9 (AZ, CA, HI, NV, AS, GU) Regional Geographic Area #10 includes EPA Region 10 (AK, ID, OR, WA) Nationwide Geographic Area Applicants should design an approach to ensure that Elig ible Services are provided to program participants throughout the entire geographic area covered by their award including to rural and remote areas . Please note that the amount of funding provided to selected applicants will be commensurate with the level and amount of Eligible Services to be provided under the award. Those selected applicants providing less Eligible Services may receive lower amounts of funding than recipients providing greater amounts or serving a large r geographic area. Applications for Nationwide Geographic Area Coverage - In addition to demonstrating how they will provide the technical assistance and Eligible Services to program participants as described in Section I , applicants interested in proposing an EJ TCTAC covering the nationwide geographic area should be capable of identifying community -focused resources available nationwide (at the federal, state, local, and private levels ) that may be available to program participants to help advance and support the objectives of this RFA. For example, nationwide geographic area applicants may develop tools, databases, platforms, and/or clearinghouses to facilitate connecting program participants to resources for the next steps in their community projects and make these tools and/or resources available to the regiona l EJ TCTACs so that they do not duplicate efforts and may prioritize delivering direct Eligible Services to program participants. App licants for nationwide EJ TCTAC funding may also propose approaches (e.g., periodic virtual meetings) to coordinate services by the r egional EJ TCTACs to promote consistency and achieve efficiencies through consolidated competitions for consulting services. Applicants selected for award in a particular geographic area may also provide with EPA's approval Eligible Services to program participants in other geographical areas. For example, a recipient may provide technical assistance to an underserved community or organizations in a remote area outside its geographic area if it is uniquely qualified to provide a specific type of technical assistance, or if requested by a program participant, as determi ned by the EPA Project Officer. The final scope of work that EPA's P roject O fficer negotiates with successful applicants will specify the terms under which recipients may provide assistance outside of their geographic areas. Accordingly, it is expected t hat there will be multiple awards resulting from this competition and providing assistance outside of the geographic area of an award may be necessary . Applicants should describe how they would provide coverage outside the geographic area of their award, collaborate with other EJ TCTAC s and with other technical assistance providers (e.g., EPA Environmental Finance Centers and Technical Assistance for Brownfields recipients) to avoid duplication of effort, and share best practices among EJ TCTACs to maximize the value of the Eligible Services provided to program participants as envisioned by this RFA. This may include such things as including links on their EJ TCTAC website to help prospective and existing program participants determine which EJ TCTAC to access, and how to do so. Additionally, as provided in EPA's General Term s and Conditions \"Copyrighted Material and Data\" (a link to -12- which can be found in Section VI.w of EPA's solicitation provisions- see Section I. G), EPA may authorize all EJ TCTAC s to use copyrighted works or other data developed with Agency funds by other EJ TCTAC s when such use promotes efficient and effective use of Federal grant funds. 5. Resources To Operate the EJ TCTAC Appl icants should have the appropriate staff (e.g., project manager and other key personnel), resources, organizational expertise and experience, knowledge, and administrative/programmatic infrastructure necessary to provide the Eligible Services described above, either through their own organization and/or through the ability to obtain it through properly procured contracts, authorized subawards, or other appropriate non-financial partnerships and collaborative mechanisms. This also includes the technical competency and kno wledge of how to use government gr ant systems (e.g., www.grants.gov, www.sam.gov, EERE Exchange ), and the ability to interpret and translate grant requirements, policies and procedures into plain language and other languages besides English as necessary. Appl icants should also describe their plan and approach for establishing their EJ TCTAC to ensure that the Eligible Services described above will be able to start being provided to program participants, especially underserved , rural, and remote communities , as expeditiously as possible following award. Note that EPA will include a \"sufficient progress\" term and condition in all EJ TCTAC awards that will require recipients to meet specified benchmarks for project implementation in a timely manner. Applicants should also describe the faci lity(s), website presence, virtual means, or other technological abilities and means/tools for providing the Eligible Services described above to program participants that is easily accessible to all of them particularly underserved communities and communi ties in remote and rural areas. This should include ensuring that the EJ TCTAC will be accessible to program participants during normal business hours and the recipient should be able to, if necessary, adjust their accessibility and hours to meet the needs of program participants including underserved communities, communities in remote and rural areas, those in different time zones than that of the recipient, and/or those with internet or other technological challenges that may affect their ability to access EJ TCTAC services. Applicants should also describe how their EJ TCTAC website will contain relevant grant technical assistance, training, and support/research information including links to relevant grant and environmental program laws, regulations, policies and procedures (e.g., www.grants.gov, www.sam.gov , EERE Exchange ), environmental justice resources (e.g., Executive Orders, governmental documents), state and private funding, and EJ TCTAC events/training. 6. EJ TCTAC Results, Success Stories, and Feedback To facilitate program effectiveness, applicants should describe an approach for documenting and measuring the success of their EJ TCTAC, which may include information on success stories attesting to the Eligible Services provided to program participants and make this information available to EPA upon request. A success story is generally one that demonstrates an effort of the EJ TCTAC to help a program participant that generated a grant or other financial award, -13- engagement by program participants to inform environmental or energy justice decision -making, or similar successes or benefits to a program participant. Applicants should also describe an approach for seeking feedback on their EJ TCTAC from program participants and prospective program participants, that includes their satisfaction with the EJ TCTAC , ideas on ways to make it more effective and additional types of assistance it should consider providing (e.g., technical assistance should be a \"two-way street\"), and what steps the applicant will take to address the feedback to improve the operation of the EJ TCTAC. Applicants should make a concerted effort to obtain relevant feedback on their EJ TCTAC from underserved communities and communities in rural and remote areas. If the applicant intends to use EPA or DOE funds to develop and administer surveys or other information collections subject to 5 CFR Part 1320 for feedback, compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act by EPA may be necessary. 7. Energy Justice Activities Applica nts should explain how their EJ TCTAC will provide the following energy justice technical assistance, training and capacity building activities to program participants, and especially underserved communities and communities in rural and remote areas, and those in proximity to current and former mine land: Identifying energy justice objectives that are aligned with a clean energy transition including community opportunities and assets to advance these objectives and transition through clean energy demonstration, deployment , workforce development, and outreach projects, including on current and former mine land s. Identifying, understanding, and analyzing financing options, including public- private partnerships and innovative financing structures, to pursue clean energy demonstration, deployment, workforce development, and outreach projects that meet energy justice needs. Creating effective materials to enable underserved communities to collaborate with the private sector and investors, including venture and angel investors, public and philanthropic organizations, on clean energy demonstration, deployment, workforce development and outreach opportunities that advance energy justice objectives and the clean energy transition E. Ineligible Activities The following are examples of ineligible activities under the awards to be made from this RFA 6 General business training or financial assessments including assistance with business plans or marketing. For example, EJ TCTAC s cannot offer training, advice, or assistance on topics such as human resources, hiring, retention, health care, quality certifi cations, 6 This is not an exhaustive list of ineligible activities. All activities receiving EPA and DOE funding are subject to requiremen ts for cost allowability in applicable regulations including limitations on consultant fees in 2 CFR Part 1500. Additionally, only activities described in the EPA approved scope of work are eligible for funding. -14- Lean, Six Sigma, or manufacturing, except where the assistance specifically relates to compliance with grant requirements Recipients a cting as the program participant's representative (e.g., recipients cannot call federal or state personnel and as sert that they speak for program participants or call a help desk and act as if they are the program participant). R ecipients must maintain their role as providing assistance, training, and support/resources to program participants and not act as their rep resentatives in communications with other parties. Training (e.g., vocational type training) for program participant personnel unrelated to the purpose of a n EJ TCTAC . Assistance in establishing a new organization, business, entity Legal advice, services, or representation Funding from EPA and DOE may not be used by EJ TCTAC recipients for the writing and/or submittal of individual grant applications for, or on behalf of, program participants to a requesting entity. EPA funds, however, may be used by E J TCTAC recipient s to provide assistance to program participants on preparing applications for funding which includes providing assistance or \"tips\" to strengthen an application to enhance its competitiveness and responsiveness to funding opportunity announcements. Conversely, DOE funds may not be used by EJ TCTAC recipients for any assistance to program participants in connection with preparing, reviewing, negotiating, or submitting any application or workplan for DOE funding, or to provide support regarding the administrative policies and requirements, cost principles, or audit requirements for individual DOE awards. Any form of eligible technical assistance from recipients to program participants on how to prepare and submit applications does not guarantee a program participant will receive funding. See Section VI.C for additional information on requirements to separately track and report on DOE funding and EPA funding. F. EPA Strategic Plan Linkage and Anticipated Outputs, Outcomes and Performance Measures This announcement supports key priorities of the Administration as detailed in Executive Order 13985 signed by President Biden on January 20, 2021 titled, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government , and Executive Order 14008 signed by Pres ident Biden o n January 27, 2021, titled Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad. Specifically, the projects selected under this RFA will support the federal government's efforts to advance racial equity and environmental and energy justice, address health outcome disparities, and support underserved communities. In addition, pursuant to Section 6a of EPA Order 5700.7, \"Environmental Results under EPA environmental- results -under-epa-assistance -agreements ), EPA must link assistance agreements to the Agency's Strategic Plan. EPA's current Strategic Plan for 2022-2026 is available at : https://www.epa.gov/planandbudget/strategicplan . The activities to be funded under this RFA support the FY 2022-2026 EPA Strategic Plan . Awards made under this RFA will support Goal 2 (Take Decisive Action to Advance -15- Environmental Justice and Civil Rights ), Objective 2.1, ( Promote Environmental Ju stice and Civil Rights at the Federal, Tribal, State, and Local Levels) of the Strategic Plan which states that: \"Building Community Capacity and Climate Resilience and Maximizing Benefits to Overburdened and Underserved Communities: EPA will increase support for community-led action by providing unprecedented investments and benefits directly to communities with environmental justice concerns and by integrating equity throughout Agency programs.\" Applicants should explain in their application how their project will further this goal and objective and they will be evaluated on this under the evaluation criteria in Section V.A. EPA Order 5700.7 also requires that applicants adequately describe environmental outputs and outcomes to be achieved under assistance agreements. Applicants must include specific statements describing the environmental results of the proposed project in terms of well- defined outputs and, to the maximum extent practicable, well- defined outcomes that will demonstrate how the project will contribute to the goals and objectives described above. 1. Outputs . T he term \"output\" means an environmental activity, effort, and/or associated work product related to an environmental goal and objective that will be produced or provide d over a period or by a specified date. Outputs may be quantitative or qualitative but must be measurable during an assistance agreement funding period. Examples of expected outputs from projects may include the following: The number of program participants, including underserved communities, utilizing the services of an EJ TCTAC . Documented outreach efforts (e.g., webinars, in-person workshops, conference presentations) undertaken by an EJ TCTAC to make program participants and especially underserved communities and communities in remote and rural areas aware of their services . Tools developed by an EJ TCTAC to ensure that their services are accessible to program participants and especially underserved communities and communities in remote and rural areas. Reports on feedback received from program participants including underserved communities and communities in remote and rural areas to improve the operability of an EJ TCTAC. Reports on program evaluations for measuring the success of an EJ TCTAC in meeting the objectives of this RFA as described above . Numb er of improvements made to a n EJ TCTAC based on feedback from program participants . Number of clean energy demonstration opportunities identified that advance energy justice objectives and are aligned with a clean energy transition. Any other appropriate and relevant outputs identified by applicants that contribute to the objectives of this RFA. 2. Outcomes. The term \"outcome\" means the result, effect or consequence that will occur from carrying out an environmental program or activity that relates to an environmental or -16- programmatic goal or objective. Outcomes may be environmental, behavioral, health- related , or programmatic in nature; must be quantitative; and may not necessarily be achievable within an assistance agreement funding period. Additionally, outcomes should be organized by expected time period (short -term, intermediate, and long -term). Short- term outcomes refer to changes in knowledge or attitudes and usually occur during the project period. Intermediate outcomes refer to changes in behaviors and actions due to the knowledge acquired and are usually measured within several months after the end of the project. Long-term outcomes refer to changes in conditions and are measured a year or several years after project completion. Short- term, intermediate, and long -term outcomes are related and build on one another. EPA encourages recipients to identify outcomes wherever possible because they lead to environmental and/or public health improvement more clearly than outputs. Examples of expected outcomes from project s may include the following: Increase in the number, quality, and responsiveness of applications for funding submitted to Federal, state, and private sector (e.g., philanthropic foundations) funding sources by underserved communities. Increased stakeholder participation in EPA and DO E programs and in private sector decision -making impacting environmental (e.g., solid and hazardous waste) and energy justice. Increase in the number, quality, and responsiveness of applications received for EPA competitive grant awards including increases in applications from underserved communities . Increased stakeholder participation in EPA and DOE programs. More efficient and effective grant administration, performance, and management by program participants resulting in fewer questioned costs, audits, and performance issues. Decrease in the number of questions and issues received by EPA staff related to www.grants.gov and www.sam.gov . Decrease in late application submissions based on better understanding of the application process . Increase in stakeholder participation in DOE programs, including those targeted at rural and remote communities or in proximity to current and former mine land. Any other appropriate and relevant outcomes identified by applicants contributing to the goals of this RFA. 3. Performance Measurement Plan . Appl icants should describe how they plan to track and monitor their project performance and progress throughout t he p roject period including their success in meeting the expected outputs and outcomes. Outputs and outcomes are critical components of an applicant's overall plan for measuring their project's performance. Applicants will be evaluated on the quality of their overall performance measurement plan including the proposed outputs, outcomes, and associated timeframes for achieving those results. Generally, higher quality performance measurement plans include specific target metrics where possible for both outputs and outcomes. The a pplicant's performance measurement plan will help gather insights, will be the mechanism to track successful progress, output and outcome strategies, and will provide the basis for developing less ons learned to inform future recipients. -17- The following questions are also useful to consider when developing output and outcome measures of quantitative and qualitative results: Wha t are the measurable short term and longer term results the EJ TCTAC will achieve? How does the EJ TCTAC measure progress in achieving the expected results (including outputs and outcomes) and how will the approach use resources effectively and efficien tly? Are the projected outputs and outcomes specific and detailed? Are specific target measures included where possible? Are target measures reasonable and achievable within the project period and for the funding amount? G. Additional Provisions for Applicants Incorporated into the Announcement Add itional provisions that apply to sections III, IV, V, and VI of this RFA and/or awards made under this RFA, can be found at EPA Announcement Clauses . These provisions are important for applying to this RFA and applicants must review them when preparing applications for this RFA.

AWARD INFORMATION (back to Contents by Section) A. Funding Availability and Period of Performance EPA , w ith potential DOE funding, anticipates providing a total of approximately $100 million in funding for awards under this RFA. EPA expects to make between 5 to 10 incrementally funded awards with periods of performance of up to five years with total funding of a pproximately up to $10 million per award depending on funding availability, the quality of applications, satisfactory progress, and other applicable considerations. The specific number of awards and the amounts may vary from these estimates. For application submission purposes, applicants should prepare budgets for up to approximately $10 million over five years with up to approximately $2 million budgeted for each year. The amount of incremental funding available in subsequent years will depe nd on funding availability , satisfactory progress, and other applicable considerations with the understanding that EPA's Project Officer will negotiate the amount of the final budget based on these considerations. B. Number , Type , and Period of Performance of Anticipated Awards It is a nticipated that between 5 -10 awards will be incrementally funded under this RFA. The awards for selected projects will be in the form of cooperative agreements because the EJ TCTAC program requires substantial involvement and interaction between the applicant and EPA and DOE. Although EPA in consultation with DOE will negotiate precise terms and conditions relating to substantial involvement as part of the award process, the anticipated substantial federal involvement for these projects may include: -18- Close monitoring of the recipient's performance to verify the results proposed by the applicant; Collaboration during the performance of the scope of work; In accordance with 2 CFR 200.317 and 2 CFR 200.318, review of proposed procurements; Reviewing qualifications of key personnel (EPA and DOE will not select employees or contractors employed by the award recipient); and Review and comment on the content of printed or electronic publications prepared (the final decision on the content of reports rests with the recipient). EPA and D OE do not have the authority to select employees or contractors employed by the recipient or subrecipients. The final decision on the content of reports rests with the recipient. Applicants should plan for the period of performance for awards to begin on March 1, 2023. All awards are subject to the availability of funds, the quality of the application s submitted, and other applicable considerations. In appropriate circumstances, EPA reserves the right to partially fund applications by funding discrete portions of the proposed projects. If EPA decides to partially fund an application, it will do so in a manner that does not prejudice any applicant or affect the basis upon which the application was evaluated and selected for award, thereby maintaining the integrity of the competition and selection process. EPA also reserves the right to make additional awards under this RFA, consistent with Agency policy and guidance, if additional funding becomes available after the original selections are made. Any additional selections for awards will be made no later than 6 months after the original selection decisions. III.

B. Content and Form of Application Submission The forms and documents required as part of the application submission are described in Section IV.A above. Below are the instructions for the Workplan and several other application documents . 1. Workplan: The Workplan is one of the most important parts of the application package and describes the work to be performed during the performance period. Under this RFA, a pplicants must submit a Workplan for a federal award that addresses how the applicant's EJ TCTAC will meet the objectives of this RFA, perform the activities and provide the services described in Section I of the RFA (the Eligible Services), and also ensure that it addresses the evaluation cri teria in Section V .A and any applicable threshold eligibility criteria in Section III. The Workplan must not exceed (20) single--25- spaced typewritten pages and be on letter size pages (8 1/2 X 11 inches). Any pages beyond twenty (20) pages will not be read by the review panel. It is recommended that applicants use a standard font (e.g., Times New Roman, Calibri, and Arial) and a 12-point font size. While these guidelines establish the acceptable type size requirements, applicants are advised that readability is of paramount importance and should take precedence in selection of an appropriate font for use in the application. Other attachments such as resumes, partnership letters, itemized budget template, and information on endowment size and/or yearly organizational budget can be submitted as attachments and are not included in the 20-page Workplan limit. Workplans must address the information described above . Make sure they also include the following information which is part of the 20-page W orkplan page limit: a. Project Summary Page - Recommended not to exceed one page and include: Project Title Project Geographic Area- See Section I.D.4 Applicant Information (name, address, main contact information) Brief Description of Applicant Organization -- Provide a brief description of the applicant 's organization, including its mission and key ongoing projects/activities in which it is involved. List of Project Partners -- include partner name and stakeholder group. For example, State University (academic); County commissioner (local government); Local church (faith- based), Local supplier (business/industry), etc.). Project Abstract -- Brief description of the main objective, activities, and outputs/outcomes of the project, including the specific geographic areas of focus. b. Partnerships , Collaboration , and Letters of Commitment (See evaluation factor V.A.1.c) Partnerships and collaboration with other interested stakeholders in performance of the project are integral to the success of the EJ TCTAC program but must comply with regulatory requirements described below if federal funds will be used to compensate par tners . Given the nature of this program, failure to demonstrate effective partnerships or collaboration with other stakeholders may adversely impact the applicant's scoring under the relevant evaluation criteria in Section V.A and may render the application less competitive than others that include partnerships and collaboration. If an applicant does not demonstrate such partnerships or collaboration, they must be able to convincingly demonstrate in their application how they can effectively perform the pro ject, and establish and operate the EJ TCTAC, without any partners or collaboration. All letters of commitment for partnerships and collaborations must be submitted by the applicant with its application package by the submission deadline. The l etters of c ommitment must be included as other attachments in the grants.gov application package (Section IV.A ) and are not subject to the 20-page Workplan limit. The letters of commitment should include information about the role and activities each partner will play in establishment and operation of the EJ -26- TCTAC as well as any resources the partner will provide. The letters of commitment must be signed by the partnering organizations. Do not include generic letters of support or recommendation. Regardless o f the source, generic letters of support will not be considered in evaluating applications. If no letters of commitment are included, then it will be assumed the applicant has no partners and they must demonstrate how they can effectively perform the proje ct and establish/operate the EJ TCTAC without partners or collaboration. In addition, groups of two or more eligible applicants may choose to form a coalition and submit a single application under this RFA; however, one entity must be responsible for the grant. Coalitions must identify which eligible organization will be the recipient of the grant and which eligible organization(s) will be subrecipients of the recipient (the \"pass- through entity\"). Subawards must be consistent with the definition of that term in 2 CFR 200.1 and comply with EPA's Subaward Policy . The pass- through entity that administers the grant and subawards will be accountable to EPA for proper expenditure of the funds and reporting and will be the point of contact for the coalition. As provided in 2 CFR 200.332, subrecipients are accountable to the pass-through entity for proper use of EPA funding. For-profit organizations are not eligible for subawards under this grant program but may receive procurement contracts. Any contracts for services or products funded with EPA financial assistance must be awarded under the competitive procurement procedures of 2 CFR Part 200 and/or 2 CFR Part 1500, as applicable. The regulations at 2 CFR 1500.10 contain limitations on the extent to which EPA funds may be used to compensate individual consultants. Refer to the Best Practice Guide for Procuring Services, Supplies, and Equipment Under EPA Assistance Agreements for guidance on competitive procurement requirements and consultant compensation. Do not name a procurement contractor (including a consultant) as a \"partner\" or otherwise in your application unless the contractor has been selected in compliance with competitive procurement requirements. Note : If you intend to fund a named or unnamed partner's participation in the project your application must describe how the proposed financial transaction complies with applicable requirements in 2 CFR Part 200, EPA's Subaward Policy, the Best Practice Guide for Procuring Services, Supplies, and Equipment Under EPA Assistance Agreements or EPA Guidance on Participant Support Costs . Note that naming a contractor (including a consultant) as a \"partner\" does not relieve the applicant from complying with competitive procurement requirements. EPA does not accept sole source contract justifications for professional services (including environmental consulting services and consulting services on preparing grant applications) that are available in the commercial marketplace. c. Past Performance Submit a list of federally and/or non- federally funded assistance agreements that your organization performed within the last three years. Assistance agreements include grants and cooperative agreements, but not contracts. List no more than 5 agreements. For the agreements you list, describe: i. -27 -Whe ther, and how, you were able to successfully complete and manage those agreements and ii. Your history of meeting the reporting requirements under those agreements including whether you adequately and timely reported on your progress towards achieving theexpected outputs and outcomes of those agreements (and if not, explain why not) andwhether you submitted acceptable final technical reports under the agreements. In evaluating applicants under these factors in Section V .A, EPA will consider the information provided by the applicant and may also consider relevant information from other sources, including information from EPA files and from current/prior grantors (e.g., to verify and/or supplement the information provided by the applicant). If your organization does not have any available past perf ormance experience related to federal and/or non- federal assistance agreements, you should state this explicitly in your application (e.g., Our organization has no past grants experience.) Including this statement will ensure you receive a neutral score for these factors (a neutral score is half of the total points available in a subset of possible points). However, if you do not provide any response for these items, you may receive a score of 0 for these factors. 2. Itemized Budget Template (Optional template available in Appendix A ): Provide a detailed budget and estimated funding amount for each project component/activity. Identify therequested federal dollars. Applicants should budget for up to $10,000,000 of funding over fiveyears at $2,000,000 per year (keep in mind that EPA reserves the right to partially fundapplications by funding discrete portions of the proposed projects). Clearly explain how thefunds will be used. Applicants must itemize costs related to personnel, fringe benefits,contractual costs, travel, equipment, supplies, other direct costs, indirect costs, and total costs.All subaward funding should be located under the \"other\" category. This section provides anopportunity for na rrative description of the budget or aspects of the budget such as \"other\" and contractual. Provide itemized costs with sufficient detail for EPA to determine thereasonableness and allowability of costs for each workplan component/activity. Wherenecessar y, your itemized budget sheet should include a budget narrative to make it clear how you determined/calculated the costs for each budget category. In addition, demonstrate the cost effectiveness of the project in terms of maximizing to the greatest extent practicable the delivery of the Eligible Services to program participants, including underserved , rural, and remote communities, as described in Section I. In accordance with 2 CFR 200.414(f), recipients that do not have a current negotiated indirect cost rate under 10% are eligible for a de minimis rate of 10% of modified total direct costs for all Federal awards. Please see EPA's IDC Policy: https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021- 04/documents/indirect- cost-policy- for-recipients -of-epa-assistance details.

Failure to include this statement may result in your receiving a score of receive a score of 0 for these factors. 6 B. Review and Selection Process Applications will be reviewed and scored under the following process: -38- 1. Threshold Eligibility Review Process - All application s will be evaluated for eligibility using the threshold eligibility criteria described in Section III .C by EPA Office of Environmental Justice (OEJ) and DOE staff. 2. Review Panel and Evaluation Process -E PA will convene a review panel(s) to review, score, and rank all eligible applications that pass the threshold eligibility review based on the merit evaluation criteria listed above. The review panel(s) will include EPA staff and may also include staff from other federal agencies. After the evaluation process, the review panel(s) will partic ipate in a conference call with OEJ and DOE staff before final selection recommendations, rankings, and evaluation results are presented to the Selection Official, the Director of OEJ. The purpose of this call is to provide an opportunity for the review pa nel(s) to discuss their evaluation results and allow OEJ and DOE staff to ask any questions about the evaluations (e.g., to discuss any evaluation issues the review panels encountered , any evaluation scoring issues). Any changes that result to the evaluations or scoring as a result of the call will be documented and will only be based on the evaluation criterion above. 3. Final Selection Process and Other Factors - The review panel will present f inal rankings and selection recommendations to the Director of OEJ , who will then make the final selections for award. In addition to this information, the Director may also consider any of the following \"other factors\" in making final selection decisions from among the high-ranking applications: Geographic Diversity (e.g., t o ensure the broadest coverage of the EJ TCTAC s and to maximize nation -wide coverage). EPA and DOE Programmatic Priorities. Organizational diversity in terms of applicant type and size (e.g., endowment, organizational budget) in order to ensure a broad representation of applicants receiving awards to improve program effectiveness. Availability of funds. In addition, because the objectives of this RFA are part of a government- wide effort to address environmental and energy j ustice concerns and challenges as illustrated by Executive Orders 13985 and 14008, information pertaining to proposed selection recommendations may be shared with other governmental departments or agencies before selections are made in order to determine whether potential selections: (1) are expected to be funded by another department or agency to minimize the possibility of duplicate funding, (2) could be affected by permitting, regulatory or other issues involving another department or agency, and/or (3) will complement or can be used to leverage funding by another department or agency to maximize value. Accordingly, in making the final funding decisions, the S election O fficial will consider the review panel rankings and recommendations, OEJ and DOE staff input based on their call with the review panel(s ), and may also consider the other factors identified above including input from other government agencies and departments as described above. The \"other factors\" may only be considered by the S election Official when determining final selections after the scoring and ranking process is complete. -39- C.

March -April 2023 Post-award conference with awardees to coordinate EJ TCTAC coverage -40- award will be made. For example, statutory authorization, fu nding or other issues discovered during the award process may affect the ability of EPA to make an award to an applicant. The award notice, signed by an EPA grants officer, is the authorizing document and will be provided through electronic or postal mail. The successful applicant may be requested to prepare and submit additional documents and forms which must be approved by EPA before the grant can officially be awarded. The time between notification of selection and award of a grant can take up to 90 days or longer. B. Administrative and National Policy Requirements Th is award is subject to the requirements of the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards; Title 2 CFR, Parts 200 and 1500. EPA also has programmatic regulations located in 40 CFR Chapter 1 Subchapter B. A listing and description of general EPA regulations applicable to the award of assistance agreements may be viewed at: https://www.epa.gov/grants/epa-policies- and- guidance-grants . C. Reporting and Plans 1. Progress Report/ Final Report Requirement. The applicant's project manager will be required to submit two semi -annual progress report for each 12 -month reporting period throughout the duration of the agreement to update the EPA Project O fficer on project progress. The project manager will also be required to have , at a minimum, semi -annual calls/meetings with the EPA Project O fficer to discuss progress. Precise terms and conditions, including frequency of calls/meetings , will be negotiated by EPA and DOE staff as part of the award process. The project m anager will also be required to submit a Final Technical Report for EPA approval within 120 days after the end of the 12-month project period. A Financial Status Report is also required and will be described in the award agreement. The EPA may collect, review, and disseminate those final reports that can serve as models for future projects. Many applicants may find it useful to document their progress using various media. This may include, but is not limited to the use of videos, blogs and other forms of social media. 2. Funding Reporting As noted herein, awards are expected to be funded by both EPA and DOE, and this funding includes appropriations received by each agency under the IIJA, annual appropriations, or both. Recipients must therefore have financial and programmatic management system s in place to separately track EPA and DOE funds, as well as IIJA and \"regular\" annual appropriation funds, using EPA and/or DOE provided accounting codes and procedures. Other reporting or tracking requirements may apply. The award will include appropriat e terms and conditions to this effect. -41- 3. Justice40 Reporting The activities to be performed under the awards are expected to contribute to the President's goal that 40% of the overall project benefits flow to disadvantaged communities (the Justice40 Initiative - See Section I.A) . Recipients, therefore, will be expected to report on certain metrics to demonstrate to what extent the activities contribute to the 40% goal. The award will include appropriate terms and conditions to this effect. 4. Quality Assurance Project Plans (QAPP) Qu ality assurance is sometimes applicable to assistance projects (see 2 CFR 1500.12 ). Quality assurance requirements apply to the collection of environmental data. Environmental data are any measurements or information that describe environmental processes, location, or conditions; ecological or health effects and consequences; or the pe rformance of environmental technology. Environmental data include information collected directly from measurements, produced from models, and compiled from other sources, such as databases or literature. Once the award is made, if a Quality Assurance Project Plan is required for the project, the applicant will have to draft a QAPP prior to beginning work on the project. You must reserve time and financial resources in the beginning of your project in order to prepare your QAPP and include the cost for developing your QAPP in your Detailed Budget. Selected applicants cannot begin data collection until EPA approves the QAPP. D. Combining Applications Into One Award If an applicant submits multiple applications under this competition, and is selected for multiple awards, EPA may award a single assistance agreement that combines the separate applications . E. Post -award meetings and EJ TCTAC Coordination On ce awards have been made, EPA and DOE intend to meet with all the recipients to confirm the coverage of each EJ TCTAC and ensure they collaborate with each other (and any other EPA or DOE technical assistance providers as appropriate) to maximize the value of the program to attain its broadest impac t, and to avoid duplication of coverage and effort. In addition, EPA and DOE intend to host regular post- award meetings with recipients to provide a forum for them to exchange ideas and best practices to strengthen the technical assistance program with a special emphasis on underserved communities and communities in rural and remote areas. Recipients can use these forums to identify technical assistance areas that would benefit from harmonization and coordination, explore joint workshops and similar informational sessions, and share expertise and experiences. EPA project officers (and DOE s taff) will participate in these discussions as appropriate. Appropriate terms and conditions, as well as EPA and DOE substantial involvement, relating to EJ TCTAC coordination and coverage will be included in the awards. -42- F. Conflicts of Interest The award s will include terms and conditions requiring that the recipient ensure that Eligible Services provided under the award are performed in a manner that prevents conflicts of interest from tainting procurements financed with public or private funding. For example, if a consultant hired by an EJ TCTAC provides technical assistance on preparing an application for federal funding then the consultant may not participate in the development of procurement specifications or other activities that violate the pro visions in 2 CFR 200.319 on full and open competition for federally funded contracts. Consultants may not receive sole source contracts based on their role in preparing the application for federal funding. Award terms and conditions will also include restr ictions that prevent consultants from marketing their services or those of affiliated firms to applicants or recipients of federal grants while providing EPA funded technical assistance.
