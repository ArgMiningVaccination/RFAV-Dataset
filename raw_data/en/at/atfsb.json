The preference for alternative therapies, and herbal medicine were indicated, and the fear of relinquishing information regarding these practices were almost paralyzing. It seemed as though they were ashamed to admit to cultural healing practices, and did not divulge information to practitioners regarding their usage. The cultural disconnect was present as alternative/complimentary medicines are valued as a culture, and \"modern\" practitioners cast judgment on their usage. This perceived stigma additionally limited the information shared by the cultural participants with modern medical treatments, potentially causing additional harm, as some herbals are potentially toxic. Today we have alternative medicine which was developed thousands of years ago and have a long-standing historical value of effectiveness, advantages, and some drawbacks. Diagnosis was the first approach to any illness. Alternative medicine looks at the factors of equilibrium and the environment in which one lives and the disease is considered an imbalance between the two; cleansing the whole body than on a particular problem to get the balance back in sync. Very much the description of the Buddhist and the Greek cultures of medicine and healing the There are still many people on both sides of the spectrum that are skeptical about treatment methods that differ from what they are used to. The validity of an herbal healer in the western world is more likely to be questioned than that of a medical doctor; while in the east, families may have been seeing a healer for decades and are more likely to question the validity of a doctor practicing western From a young age, I wanted to be a conventional physician, but as I grew older, I became more disillusioned with our current medical system. As I became more disillusioned, I was more drawn to the naturopathic field and the opportunities it presented to treat problems naturally. In addition, I felt that the naturopathic field offered more personalized care to the patient as they struggled with their different health problems. The way that conventional medicine practices tries to treat as many patients as possible in the shortest amount of time. The field seems not to respect the patient as a person, and I feel like every person should experience a favorable level of respect when interacting with medical professionals. In addition, I feel that patients should know that their doctor cares for them and their health, and that is difficult to convey in a 15-minute appointment, especially when compared with a 45-minute appointment. As a Naturopathic Physician, I feel that I will be able to provide my patients with the care that they deserve. Through the enthusiasm of alternative medicine by patients, the health and social care sector comes across to:\" ethical issues of efficacy, training, competence and patient safety, \"according to (Nursing times ,2005). Therefore, it is important to understand the principles behind complementary therapies and their usage. Over the past 10 years, the pharmaceutical formulary for licensed Naturopathic Physicians has absolutely expanded. In many states where Naturopathic Physicians have licensure, they also have the ability to prescribe pharmaceutical drugs to help their patients. While the Physicians may not always choose to go with pharmaceuticals as a treatment Holistic Medicine Holistic Medicine, commonly referred to as \"Alternative Medicine\", is a vast and rapidly growing new scientific field. It is derived mainly from ancient, traditional methods of healing that have often been practiced in the East for centuries. These include a variety of techniques from herbal healing to acupuncture to homeopathy to energy channeling. Due to the large number of methods that are covered by the term, there are various definitions of Holistic Medicine. However, all literature seems to agree that Alternative Medicine, is exactly what the name suggests: an 'alternative' approach to healing and medicine. It is a more personal move toward health care, which attempts to connect the mind, body and spirit. Preventare: The last principal is the Naturopath's ultimate goal and that is to prevent diseases. We live in a fast-paced society and we have never learnt how to prevent diseases from the beginning, we always want the quickest and more efficient way to treat illnesses but it's generally after we become Though the question does not indicate whether the word has negative or positive associations the majority of participants chose words that expressed either full support for the idea or skepticism and words that pain \"natural medicine\" in a negative light.

The main purpose of this study was to see the effectiveness of using naturopathic medicine on people who experience depression and anxiety. II. Herbal medicine has been used for many, many years and is a great natural alternative to modern medicine. Most patients now prefer herbal medicine as compared to medicinal drugs. They are becoming popular to treat everything from minor to major to diseases. The reason why people are so into herbal medicine is because of their natural qualities that promote a healthy method of healing various products. The practice and participation of alternative medicine or complementary medicine is becoming more and more accepted, accessible, and utilized on a worldwide scale. Some possibilities to explain this are the perception of alternative medications and therapies as being more effective when reversing or treating chronic conditions and having fewer and less harmful or painful side effects as the pharmaceuticals which the majority of doctors prescribe to their patients in need (Belew, 1999). Estimations have been systematically calculated claiming that the earth contains approximately 600,000 species of plants with only five percent of them investigated chemically or pharmacologically (Bunce,1987). During current times, many have shifted These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). Personalized treatment - Naturopathy does not believe in flat treatments where patients receive the same prognosis for the same symptoms. Naturopaths study the symptoms and beyond to treat the problem at its roots and not just cure the physical symptoms. Thus two people with the same physical symptoms might not receive the same plan of treatment to cure them. This allows for personalized and individual treatments that are inherently applicable to each patient. Thus this form of medicine goes to the heart of the problem to rid the patient of physical symptoms as well as the underlying cause of the sickness or disease. "}
