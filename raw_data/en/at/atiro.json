United States General Accounting OfYIce Washington, D.C. 20548 Resources, Community, and Economic Development Division B-240304 August l&l990 The Honorable Dan Glickman Chairman, Subcommittee on Wheat, Soybeans, and Feed Grains Committee on Agriculture House of Representatives Dear Mr. Chairman: On August 10, 1989, you asked us to provide information on aflatoxin research funded as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) fiscal year 1989 appropriation. In addition, we are including financial data on each of the subject ARS research projects. To provide a more comprehensive overview of USDA's aflatoxin research efforts, we are also including information on (1) fiscal year 1990 research projects undertaken by ARS as part of a program devoted solely to the prevention of aflatoxin formation and (2) aflatoxin research projects that involve USDA's Cooperative State Research Service (CSRS). Some of these research projects are carried out by state institutions, including agricultural experiment stations associated with land-grant colleges and universities, and may be funded, in part, by the federal government. FISCAL YEAR 1989 ARS AFLATOXIN-RELATED RESEARCH PROJECTS The ARS data show a total of 11 research projects in fiscal year 1989 designed to address aflatoxin problems with corn (and other feed grains), cottonseed, peanuts, and domestic animals. Funding for these projects totaled $5,002,700, of which ARS designated $3,782,400 as supporting specific aspects of aflatoxin research. (See table 1.) The remaining $1,220,300 supported other aspects of four of the projects.

FISCAL YEAR 1990 ARS AFLATOXIN PREVENTION RESEARCH PROJECTS The ARS appropriation for fiscal year 1990 included a total of $4,248,700 for aflatoxin research. Of this amount, $750,000 was specifically earmarked to begin a research program devoted solely to aflatoxin prevention. ARS solicited research proposals for this effort from the nation's universities/experiment stations and established an \"Aflatoxin Task Force\" to review the proposals received. The Task Force was comprised of eight industry representatives, two from each of the corn, peanut, cotton, and tree nut industries, and was chaired by ARS. ARS received 23 research proposals in response to its solicita ions. CF On the basis of Task Force determinations, $665,500 was committed to aflatoxin prevention research-- 'Less than the $750,000 originally appropriated was subsequently available for this research because of Gramm- Rudman-Hollings budget reductions and associated ARS administrative/overhead costs. u 2 B-240304 $332,750 to start eight new research projects and $332,750 to continue funding for two existing ARS projects. The National Peanut Council's Director for Industry Services said that the aflatoxin prevention projects are concentrated more on research to eliminate aflatoxin, rather than its detection and control. Also, according to the director the proposed research follows two separate approaches: (1) developing aflatoxin-resistant varieties of major crops and (2) developing biocompetitive controls to the aflatoxin- forming mold. Once approved, the research projects were coordinated with the Multi-Crop Aflatoxin Working Group. The Working Group membership includes the California Pistachio Commission; Corn Refiners Association, Incorporated; National Corn Growers Association: National Cotton Council; National Cottonseed Products Association: National Peanut Growers Association; National Peanut Council; and the Prune, Raisin, and Walnut Board. In comments submitted to the Subcommittee on Rural Development, Agriculture, and Related Agencies, House Committee on Appropriations, in March 1990, the Working Group's Chairman said that increased funding is needed for the ARS aflatoxin prevention research program in order to eliminate aflatoxin by the year 2000. The Working Group Chairman believes that a funding level of $2.75 million is required for fiscal year 1991. Appendix II contains more detailed information on the fiscal year 1990 aflatoxin prevention research projects. CSRS AFLATOXIN-RELATED RESEARCH As of October 18, 1989, USDA's Current Research Information System (CRIS) listed 126 CSRS and state aflatoxin-related research projects as \"active.\" According to the CRIS Director, estimated completion time frames for research projects can change, and projects are retained in the system as active until an official termination report is received, regardless of the estimated termination dates given. The director said it was therefore possible that some of the state identified projects with termination dates that have already passed may have actually ended but that no 3 B-240304 termination report had been received. We were told that more current information on the actual status of some state projects might require direct contact with the individual research investigators involved. According to a CSRS Budget Office official, CSRS does not allocate research funds on an individual project basis. CSRS research funds are allocated to the states on a formula basis, and the individual research proposals to be funded with these dollars must be reviewed and approved by CSRS before these funds can be spent on them. The states, in turn, determine how the funds will be allocated among their various research institutions and/or approved projects. Also, most of the funds for these research projects usually come from state and/or private versus federal sources. Data regarding the state allocation of federal funds to individual CSRS projects were not available from CSRS or CRIS. The CRIS Director said that some state projects listed in the CRIS voluntarily participate in and share research information under the CSRS cooperative research program but are not financed with USDA funds. According to the director, regardless of funding source, the expenditures for all participating projects are reported to CRIS each year. However, amounts spent on various aspects of aflatoxin control research are not separately identified. Also, a substantial number of institutions and projects are included, and a time frame of several months or more is involved before all the information is received, compiled, checked for errors, and entered into the CRIS. According to the director, fiscal year 1989 expenditure information would not be available until mid-1990. Research objectives for the 126 CSRS and state research projects are provided in appendix III. SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY Information on ARS and CSRS research projects is maintained in USDA's computerized CRIS. However, ARS preferred to provide its data to us separately, based on its own records. We therefore obtained information on ARS research projects directly from the ARS National Program Leader for Food Safety and Health. We obtained data on CSRS and state research projects from CRIS, based on a search of about 28,000 research resumes in the data base. Information on research to prevent aflatoxin formation being funded under VARS' 1990 appropriation was obtained from the ARS National 4 'B-240304 Program Leader for Food Safety and Health and the National Peanut Council. The Council is a member of the Multi-Crop Aflatoxin Working Group-- an informal alliance of producers formed to seek scientific solutions to the aflatoxin problem. ARS met with the Working Group to coordinate and obtain industry views regarding the additional research projects approved for aflatoxin prevention. Although the information we are providing was obtained from and discussed with agency/industry officials who agreed with the information in the fact sheet, we did not independently verify data accuracy or try to validate the computer/information system(s) that generated it. As requested, however, we did not obtain official agency comments on this fact sheet. Information regarding ARS and CSRS research efforts can be obtained by contacting the ARS Information Staff, Beltsville, Maryland, 20705, telephone (301) 344-2264, or the CSRS Administrator's Office, Washington, D.C., 20250- 2200, telephone (202) 447-4423, respectively. As you requested, we are sending copies of this report today to Representative Jim Jontz. As arranged with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this fact sheet until 30 days from the date of this letter. At that time, we will provide copies to the Secretary of Agriculture and other interested parties. If you have any questions about the information in this fact sheet, please call me at (202) 275-5138. Major contributors to this fact sheet are listed in appendix IV. Sincerely yours, John W.
