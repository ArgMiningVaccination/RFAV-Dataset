Ready to dig deeper into your health? *Healthy Strategy consultations are a prerequisite for future appointments. **Consultations are for informational purposes only, and are not intended to take the place of seeing your regular physician or other healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment. Third Opinion MD expects clients to be in communication with their providers to discuss goals and changes to their healthcare regimen. \"I especially appreciated [Dr. de la Torre's] point to look beyond what had been done. I feel she gave great advice and would hope other doctors would lean more in that direction. She asked about nutrition, etcetera, and I feel came up with a great holistic plan for me.\" Reasons Why Common Client Concerns - Headaches - Palpitations - Frequent Colds - Anxiety - Stress - Depression - Addiction - Fatigue - Insomnia - Food sensitivities - Painful/Heavy Periods - Pregnancy & Fertility - Menopause - Heart disease - Skin problems - Poor memory - Attention problems - Post-Surgical Pain - Digestive problems - Lack of motivation - Burnout - Allergies/Asthma - Weight gain - Anger issues - Relationships - Chronic pain - Urinary problems - Cancer Healthy Strategy consultations are beneficial for you if: - You've seen multiple doctors for your concerns but your symptoms have persisted. - If you're tired of the pill for the ill solutions after a very brief one-problem visit with a doctor. - You've been told there's nothing more you can do and pain or chronic disease management is your only option. - You're frustrated by the lack of face time and true care you receive from your medical practitioner. - You suffer from chronic pain and are motivated to explore all the options that serve you best. - You want to explore reducing or getting off your prescription and over-the-counter drug regimen. - You want to potentially reduce your healthcare costs in the future. - You want to be a part of a significant transformation in the way health is achieved for you and your community. Healthy Strategy consultations are NOT intended to: - Diagnose or take the place of your regular physician/healthcare provider. - Address current emergencies - Take the place of the work you will do to make positive and lasting changes. - Promise a cure (But we can certainly keep it in the realm of possibilities) - Blame or vilify specific medical models or people. We want you to gather the best from each medical model available to you, and empower you with the best tools for the job. Let us help navigate your health. FAQs Do you take health insurance? At Third Opinion MD, we provide information and educate you about your health. We are not a clinic nor do we offer clinical services that fall under insurance plans. It's important to keep in mind that having health insurance is not the end of the road, only part of the equation. Health insurance limits coverage to what they deem to be valuable for their bottom line and for general health standards. They are by no means inclusive enough of your individual health needs. What is your privacy policy regarding health records? Are you HIPAA compliant? We take your privacy very seriously, and health and other sensitive information are secured via strict European GDPR standards. Our client platform offers a secure client portal to send and receive information. It is not HIPAA compliant. The biggest similarity between GDPR and HIPAA is that security is at their core. However, the two are not the same. GDPR sets standards for all sensitive personal data, while HIPAA deals with only Protected Health Information (PHI.) Any health information you send to Third Opinion MD is considered voluntary and you will be asked to agree to this prior to working with Dr. de la Torre. You can review the privacy policy [here](https://thirdopinionmd.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WEBSITE-Privacy-Policy-GDPR-compliant-updated-10-15-2021-1.pdf). What is the value in creating a Health Strategy when I already have a team of providers caring for my conditions? Every successful team needs a leader. At Third Opinion MD, we intend to guide and coach you to fill that leadership role to be your best health advocate. We can teach you how to advocate for yourself, how to navigate and communicate with your team members, to ensure that this team is serving your individual needs, and if they are communicating well with you and with one another. What other services or products are available? Currently, 1:1 consultations are available. In the future, there will be exciting learning opportunities that include self-paced classes, live webinars (in person when safe and available), and an upcoming book on navigating through the healthcare system.
