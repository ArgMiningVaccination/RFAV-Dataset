Healthy People 2020 recommends a national goal of 80 percent to maintain herd immunity (Child Trends Databank, 2015). Despite the life-saving importance of immunization, these stagnant rates show that many mothers of U.S. children do not adhere to vaccination recommendations. These critics and skeptics of vaccines are a part of the anti-vaccination movement. Originating upon the discovery of the first vaccine in 1796, this movement has progressed for hundreds of years. Currently, through media and prominent anti-vax social figures, the public can easily be relayed messages of vaccine controversies rather than scientific facts. Falsehoods include perceived low risk of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases, \"overloading\" the child's immune system, mercury in vaccines, reports of negative reactions after vaccination, and the infamously popular myth that vaccines cause autism (Mittenzwei, Morrison, & Williams, Knott 1 Ethan Knott Engrish 9 2 June 2016 How Vaccines don't cause Autism Imagine this, you have had your first child.

Your child is young and innocent and you want them to be protected from all illnesses. The doctor asks if you want your child to be vaccinated. You do a search about the risks from getting vaccinated and you learn that it supposedly can cause autism. Even though you know that you want your child to live a healthy life, you don't want to possibly give them autism. The question still remains, do vaccines cause autism? One of the most controversial stories in today's medicine is between autism and vaccinations. Autism is a disorder that makes it difficult for people to communicate with others and form relationships with them. It has been thought that vaccinations that children receive at an early age cause autism. Autism has become more prevalent over the years and scientists are still unsure how the disorder has come about. Some parents have taken it upon themselves to not vaccinate their children because they believe it will cause their child to become autistic. The real question is do vaccines really cause autism and if so which vaccine is it? Although the negative claims behind anti-immunization stances are deceptive and discredited, some parents find it difficult to accept that vaccines are necessary and safe. Many of these reasons are due to personal or religious beliefs that have persuaded parents to bypass immunizations for their children. Consequently, health officials are seeing disquieting rises of diseases that are easily preventable. The CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) has reported hundreds of measles cases in the United States in 2011, the largest number in 15 years (Ben-Joseph, Elana). Essentially, almost all of these cases were in individuals who had not received a vaccine shot. Also found in the article was that a great amount of the quarrel over the shots comes from a 1998 study that tried to connect autism to a type of vaccine that defends against measles. However, there has been no scientific evidence that a vaccine or a combination of any of the shots induces autism. Undoubtedly, the doctor that wrote the article, calling vaccines a \"deliberate fraud\" ,lost his license for not submitting any evidence of his claim and causing people to neglect shots for that year. Sadly, due to that article, 1 in 4 parents still believe that vaccines are Vaccinations and Autism Spectrum Disorder Summary of \"Vaccines Cause Autism\" In the article, \"Vaccines Cause Autism,\" Michael Snyder, an attorney and writer, attempts to convince parents of young children that autism is directly linked to childhood vaccinations. He claims that numerous toxins, including thimerosal, are present in vaccines that are forced into the bloodstream, later causing neurological and brain damage to children. He says that autism has risen by 78 percent over the past decade, and that 1/88 children in the US have an autistic disorder. Snyder believes that most autistic individuals start out completely normal, and that the vaccinations they are given are harming them. He blames the pharmaceutical companies for being too Every child born in America is unique: whether it be because of skin color, hair color, birth weight, complications while still in the womb, or difficulties at birth. Yet when it comes to vaccinations they are all treated equal and are expected to follow the government recommended vaccination schedule. Once these vaccinations have been given, they cannot be removed from a child's body. The harm they may have caused a child, cannot be reversed. Parents need to be aware of what is in these vaccines and the possible harmful effects they can have on their child. While the official cause of autism has not been clearly determined, parents of young children and expecting parents need to be aware that research shows a definite link between Some parental concerns persist that vaccines may cause Autism. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed throughout the years. There is a major worldwide increasing rate of Autism diagnoses. Theories have centered on measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, thimerosal, and the large number of vaccines being administered. Studies have showed that A recent hysteria has spread over the United States as fast as it did in Salem over three-hundred years ago. When people can not understand a negative reaction from the medicine they look towards rumors as answers. An instance is \" most prominently actress and model Jenny McCarthy, who has attributed her son 's diagnosis of autism to vaccination,\" (Smuskiewicz). There has been a growing number of rumors where parents attribute disorders to vaccines like multiple sclerosis, \"other claims have drawn associations between the hepatitis B vaccine and multiple sclerosis,\" (Smuskiewicz). All these disorders are known to deal with a weakened immune system, taking advantage of that fact upset parents are talking about \" toxic factors responsible for causing diseases and disabilities\" to which doctors have logical counterclaims. Many talk of how those vaccines are used in order to keep the public as a whole protected from the spreading of diseases, but \"...vaccine opponents fail to support their claims with plausible explanations for the biochemical mechanisms by which vaccines could cause the diseases, disabilities, or deaths that are claimed,\" (Smuskiewicz). Experts were able to prove doctors correctly as the proportions of mercury to the vaccine were \"too small\" to cause any actual harm over a few minor effects. A multitude of The topic of childhood vaccinations and the dangers that accompany them has been a topic of controversy in contemporary times. At the near edge of the twenty-first century, a man named Doctor Andrew Wakefield released a study which created a mass uproar in both parents and health professionals alike. Parents Science or Pseudoscience? I. Vaccines & Autism Do Vaccines cause Autism? II. Abstract Do vaccines cause autism is a question that has been bouncing around for over twenty years. The increase in the number of diagnosed cases of Autism Spectrum Disorder has increased significantly and due to the impact this has in people's lives Summary of \"Vaccines and Autism\" In the journal of \"Vaccines and Autism\" author Bernard Rimland looks at the possible role of vaccines in autism. Rimland provides crucial data in understanding autism, the possible role of vaccines in autism, and the risks of vaccines in certain children. Rimland states before One subject that has been very controversial for many years is the role of vaccinations causing Autism spectrum disorder in children. Since Eric Gallup was a healthy baby until he received was his first measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination in 1986. His parent noticed his behavior and ability to communicate after took the vaccinated. Eric had a serious reaction to the vaccine, according to his parent. In the year of 1989, he was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Eric Gallup's parents developed a hypothesis that childhood vaccine was responsible for Eric's autism spectrum disorder. The risk of Autism through vaccination theory was once again disproved by a study conducted in 2013 by the Journal of Pediatrics. At the head of the study was Dr. Frank DeStefano, who is the director of the Immunization Safety Office at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study was conducted using 256 children who had autism and 752 children who did not (Lindeman para 3). By looking at \"antigens, the substances in vaccines that cause the body's immune It's hard to imagine a world without vaccines\u2014a world where \"getting sick\" had the potential to be fatal (or at least cause irreparable damage to one's body). In this world, diseases robbed millions of bright-eyed children of their lives. Thankfully, though, with the development of vaccines, populations have grown larger and healthier over the past century. Sadly, despite the improved longevity of our species, many people are still undecided about\u2014or vehemently against\u2014childhood vaccination. They claim that vaccinations are dangerous and responsible for autism and other conditions. Medical experts, however, refute these claims by citing both the safety and effectiveness of vaccinations. In fact, according to Centers for Disease Control and Even though it is a requirement by law to have children vaccinated before starting kindergarten, parents are refusing or delaying their children to be given specific vaccines due to the risk of their offspring developing autism (Wakefield). The components of specific childhood vaccines are what scares the parents, not the vaccine in general. Childhood vaccines contain the compound thimerosal and mercury which is not even necessary in vaccines. These compounds are only added to vaccines to act as a preservative, which allows the vaccine to be protected against contamination since there are several doses of vaccines in the same bottle (Plotkin et al.). If the compounds are not used as a main ingredient in certain vaccines, then they should not be added due to the fatal side effects. With that being said, when \"a child gets a vaccine, the presence of the amount of mercury exceed the federal safety guidelines for the oral ingestion of mercury\" (Wakefield), and the federal guidelines for ingestion of mercury in children is 0.3 micrograms. Since the children will be inhaling or ingesting more mercury and thimerosal than allowed my law, it can lead to intestine and body mutations. More specifically, multiple vaccines can overwhelm the immune system, create wrong interactions with the nervous system and even damage to the brain tissue (Plotkin et al.). Not only will "}
