Founders Geraldine Howard and Sue Beechey began their careers in the 1970s as therapists, supplementing patients' sessions with the use of aromatherapy. After seeing the positive effects essential oils had on their own wellbeing and that of others, the therapists' passion for incorporating oils into their daily regimen grew. And, in 1985, the two decided to create their own proprietary blend of oils, and Aromatherapy Associates was born. Restless sleepers will find relief in the Ultimate Moment of Sleep set, which contains a bath oil, sleep mist, body butter, and eye mask. In need of a reset?
