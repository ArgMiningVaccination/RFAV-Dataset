Food businesses must ensure eating and drinking utensils and food contact surfaces of equipment: - are clean - have had heat and/or chemicals, or other processes applied to them so that the number of microorganisms on the surface or utensil is reduced to a level that does not: - compromise the safety of the food with which it may come into contact - permit the transmission of infectious disease. Clean and sanitary premises that comply with the relevant requirements of the Australian New Zealand Food Standards Code can demonstrate to the appropriate enforcement agency that a food business is serious about producing high quality, safe and suitable food. Meeting relevant legislation requirements for cleaning and maintenance is not only important for compliance reasons; it is also beneficial for the success of a food business. Consumers are now increasingly aware of the requirements of food businesses and the processes needed to produce safe and suitable food. Not only will consumers question poor food handling and hygiene practices, they are also more likely to return to clean, well maintained premises. Refer to the [Food Safety Standards (external site)](https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/foodsafety/standards/Pages/Food-Safety-Standards-(Chapter-3).aspx) of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code, specifically: - Standard 3.2.2 Food Safety Practices and General Requirements (clause 19 and 20) - Standard 3.2.3 Food Premises and Equipment.
