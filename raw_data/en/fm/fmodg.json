In addition to sensory physiology, the mechanics of sensory structures condition the sensory feedback and shape the information available to the nervous system. I study how biomechanics, sensory feedback and motor dynamics help achieve movement control. Movement control in insects is especially challenging because they perform extremely fast aerial maneuvers. Mechanosensors provide extremely rapid feedback on a wing stroke-to-wing stroke basis. Insect wings are covered with dome-shaped strain sensors, called campaniform sensilla which provide feedback about wing deformations that occur due to body rotations and hence inform about external perturbations as well as insect's self-motion. We used extracellular electrophysiology to record from campaniform sensilla on hawkmoth wings to understand how they capture information about wing motion. Using computational methods, we built neuronal models that capture the firing response of these sensors and predicted their response to more naturalistic wing movements. I will briefly discuss current projects that use biomechanical models and comparative methods to understand the interaction of wing mechanics and sensing. In addition to these strain sensors, insect cuticle is embedded with a variety of mechanosensors. Another mechanosensory organ called the pilifer, occurs as a bundle of hair bristles at the base of hawkmoth's specialized mouthparts. Hawkmoths are expert flower foragers and hover over flowers to feed from them, even as the flowers sway in the wind, typically in low light conditions of dusk and dawn. Our behavioral studies show that they systematically probe the floral surfaces with their extremely long and flexible mouthpart called the proboscis for tactile cues that guide the insect to a tiny nectary at the center of the flower. Moreover, other behavioral studies suggest that rapid mechanosensory feedback from pilifers must inform the moths about the relative position of the flower and hence help track a swaying flower successfully. Preliminary recordings from the pilifers show that these are extremely sensitive and respond within a few milliseconds of a stimulus. Future experiments will seek to understand how pilifers encode motion of the mouthparts, and hence extract tactile features of the flower, encode floral movements, and control flight movements. These results help us understand how insect sensory systems shape their flight and feeding behaviors. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| RNA has never been more in the limelight than today. RNA viruses, RNA vaccines, RNA therapies and much more have brought RNA to the forefront of science, technology and human health. Inspired by our studies on natural RNAs, my group is interested in developing translatable technologies for RNA-based diagnostics, therapeutics and novel solutions towards anti-microbial resistance. RNA localization, protein production, interactions with partners and even the lifetime of RNA in the cell are influenced by its structure. Hence, new advances in RNA-based technologies require an understanding of RNA structure along with function. Over the years, my group has developed various capabilities that let us identify, analyze, probe, compare and visualize RNA structure. In this talk, I will highlight our work on i) RNA-based technologies for diagnostics and surveillance, where we couple whole-genome local RNA structure analysis with engineered RNA biosensors and use this for specific nucleic-acid detection, ii) Riboswitches and non-coding RNAs as candidates for novel anti-microbial solutions, and iii) naturally occurring RNA switches in bacteria and viruses where we elucidate their mechanisms of translational control, their partnership with signaling proteins and ultimately their function in cells. Understanding the principles of structural switching and how structure enables function in these natural RNAs enables us to develop novel RNA switches for customized applications. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| VCA is a life enhancing procedure which comprises transplantation of organs with heterogenous tissue types such as face, hand and abdomen. Conventionally, systemic drug delivery has been practiced in VCA. The biggest hurdle preventing the widespread use of this surgery is daily lifelong immunosuppression which is systemically administered to patients to prevent rejection. The systemic immunotherapy leads to various adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, metabolic complications and malignancies. In current work, I will discuss two different approaches that we have developed for local drug delivery during VCA. One is the use of small amphiphilic hydrogelator, triglycerol monostearate (TGMS) for inflammation responsive drug delivery of an immunosuppressant, tacrolimus. In our first proof-of-concept studies, we show that a single dose of tacrolimus loaded hydrogel prevents graft rejection of >100 days compared to the same dose injection of tacrolimus alone, which gave a median graft survival of ~33.5 days. We have further modified this system for dual drug delivery and non-invasive monitoring of the drug depot using a near infrared dye. In another approach, we discuss the synthesis and characterization of a prodrug-based polymer. The polymer can be used to form microparticles and hydrogels, which can be used for localized drug delivery in VCA. | | Defects in chromosome-microtubule attachment can cause chromosomal instability (CIN), frequently associated with infertility and aggressive cancers. Chromosome-microtubule attachment is mediated by a large macromolecular structure, the kinetochore. Sister kinetochores of each chromosome are pulled by microtubules from opposing spindle-poles, a state called biorientation which prevents chromosome missegregation. Kinetochore-microtubule attachments that lack the opposing-pull are detached by Aurora-B/Ipl1 kinase. It has been a long-standing puzzle as to how mono-oriented attachments that precede biorientation are spared despite the lack of opposing-pull. Using an RNAi-screen, we uncover a unique role for the Astrin-SKAP complex in protecting mono-oriented attachments. We provide evidence of domains in the microtubule-end associated protein that sense changes specific to end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachments and assemble an outer-kinetochore crescent to stabilise attachments. We find that Astrin-PP1 and Cyclin-B-CDK1 pathways counteract each other to preserve mono-oriented attachments. Thus, CIN prevention pathways are not only surveying attachment defects but also actively recognising and stabilising mature attachments independent of biorientation. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Coumarin is a structurally simple scaffold widespread in nature, found in many plants and edible foods. Coumarins have attracted great attention in biological applications due to their three unique characteristics: 1) fluorescent, emit light in ultraviolet and blue; 2) photocleavable, routinely utilized to prepare caged compounds; 3) biologically active, many drugs and pharmacological contain coumarin scaffold. These properties can be modulated as desired by introducing substitutions on the coumarin core. I have used coumarins for preparing useful caged compounds for neuroscience, and better fluorescent stains for mitochondria, and thoroughly investigated the underlying mechanisms. My findings from mechanism details offered new applications in biology and medicinal chemistry. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Morphology is one of the fundamental dimensions for macroevolutionary studies. To understand intricate evolutionary patterns in structures and functional correlates of various adaptive morphological traits, several approaches have been developed in recent years. An integrated approach implementing understanding of natural history, phylogeny, biogeography, morphology and adaptive landscapes is instrumental to assess the evolution of organismal structures and functions. Recent advances in imaging and computational techniques have enabled biologists to estimate linear and non-linear measurements of structures and subsequent manifestation of these estimates to complex functions revealing biomechanical and kinetic aspects of functional morphology. Among various advanced methods, MicroCT and geometric morphometry have become instrumental in assessing functional morphology both qualitatively and quantitatively. These techniques along with advanced comparative phylogenetic methods further strengthen aspects of functional morphology revealing complex evolutionary patterns. To examine the effects of adaptive forces on the functional morphology of various traits, insects including butterflies with their greatly diverse internal and external morphological features is one of the best model systems. Additionally, butterfly assemblages in the unique heterogeneous habitat of India with their interesting evolutionary history provide with great opportunity to investigate complex evolutionary patterns. Therefore, I focused on understanding how advanced techniques enable the analyses of adaptive morphology to reveal evolutionary patterns in various Indian butterflies. I performed multiple case studies on the adaptive functional morphology of butterflies, using geometric morphometrics and MicroCT. Firstly, I investigated how mimicry drives the mode and tempo of the trait evolution such as flight morphology and wing colour patterns in the mimetic butterfly community of Western Ghats. Secondly, I explored the structures and functions of specialized organs that mediate the multimodal interaction between a myrmecophilic butterfly caterpillar and tending ant species, using MicroCT. Next, I examined the presence of mechanical lock and key between conspecific male and female external genitalia interactions among butterflies across different families using MicroCT. I further examined wing shape divergence in Calinaga butterflies and revised the taxonomic status of Indian Tarucus butterflies based on extensive natural history and morphological data. Collectively these works put together an integrative approach to answering questions in comparative and functional morphology. | | Lysosomes are key organelle for cellular protein degradation. Amino acids are being generated upon delivery and subsequent degradation of proteins within lysosomal lumen. However, the fate, function and patho-physiological significance of these lysosomally-generated amino acids are not clearly known. Moreover, the alteration of lysosomal amino acid pool in response to the changes in the nutritional status in extracellular microenvironment remained completely unknown. The newly emerging concept establishing this organelle as the signaling hub for amino acid homeostasis and its importance in age-related diseases are at its infancy. My work focuses particularly on non-traditional role of this conventional 'garbage-recycling' organelle. My work is a first ever attempt to understand the molecular logic of establishing lysosome as vital decision maker for amino acid storage and usage in cell upon communicating with extracellular environment. I will present my discovery showing the mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin)-independent, RagGTPase-Ragulator (essential components of the mTOR-complex)-dependent novel amino acid homeostasis pathway that generates essential amino acid storage in lysosome under starvation in extracellular environment. This lysosomal amino acid storage pool is further utilized for protein translation to potentially sustain cell growth in starvation. I have demonstrated role of this novel pathway in cancer, potentially in neurodegeneration, Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs) and aging, which awaits further discovery. I will also present my previous work in one of the neurodegenerative disorders, ALS, where I have identified aberrant mTOR-activity-mediated lysosomal-autophagy hyperactivation which potentially alter lysosomal nutrient storage in ALS-motor neurons in mouse model, which could have potential clinical significance. | | TANGO1, a transmembrane protein assembles into a ring at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit site. The cytoplasmic part of TANGO1 stitches the membrane enclosed within the ring (donor of secretory cargoes) to ERGIC (the next compartment in the secretory pathway). Fusion between donor and ERGIC creates a conduit, a tunnel, which is used to export cargoes from the ER. The transmembrane helices of TANGO1 in the ring form a barrier to prevent miscibility of ERGIC into the bulk of ER. This method of tunnelling cargoes from ER to the next secretory compartment, the ERGIC, is fundamentally different from production of known vesicles in exocytosis (Raote and Malhotra. Ann. in the ER lumen and recruits cytoplasmic tethering proteins to connect ERES to the next secretory compartment (ERGIC/cis-Golgi). The fusion of ERES to ERGIC is used to transfer cargo while maintaining the identity of the two compartments. In this assembly, COP coats remain as collars at the neck of this tunnel. | | Electrons and electron microscopy have the power to resolve atomic details. However, electron beam-induced movement and radiation damage are some of the factors that limit the resolution that can be achieved for biological specimens. In particular, the radiation damage of biological molecules by electrons requires averaging of multiple molecular images to obtain higher signal to noise ratio and thus higher resolution. During the last few years, there has been enormous technical progress in the structure determination of biological macromolecules by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) both as single molecules as well as ultrastructural features within the cells and has become a popular technique. In the lab, we use cryoEM as the major technique to tackle interesting and challenging biological problems in particular at the membrane interface. In this seminar, I will describe the structural and functional characterisation of two model systems: 1) a robust microbial enzyme with interesting biochemical properties and active site, which we have also been using as test sample for cryoEM specimen preparation and data collection 2) a highly dynamic membrane protein belonging to the class C GPCR namely the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGlu5) and how it is activated by its ligand to result in a signalling event. | | Calcium-induced mucin secretion from goblet cells by exogenous agonist-dependent (stimulated) and -independent (baseline) manner composes the mucus layer that protects our epithelial lining from pathogens and allergens. Hyper and hypo secretion of mucins is linked to several diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Crohn's disease and colorectal cancer progression. We would like to target mucins to control diseases of the airway and colon, but we first need to understand how cells secrete the right quantity and quality of mucins under normal physiological conditions. We performed a genome-wide screen to identify Proteins Involved in Mucin Secretion (PIMS) in colon cancer cell lines. Our data reveal that cooperation between the sodium channels TRPM4-TRPM5 and sodium-calcium exchangers (NCXs) promotes entry of extracellular Ca++ to release mucin by the stimulated pathway from goblet cells. Baseline mucin secretion, on the other hand, is triggered by intracellular calcium oscillations mostly by the function of ER-located ryanodine receptors (RYRs). These calcium oscillations act via a small Ca++ binding protein KChIP3 to control the fusion propensity of mucin granules. KChIP3-bearing mature mucin granules do not fuse to the plasma membrane. Upon binding to calcium, KChIP3 dissociates from mature granules, which then fuse to plasma membranes. In other words, KChIP3 attached to the granules acts as a brake- a negative regulator- for the fusion of mucin granules to the plasma membrane. Loss of KChIP3 results in mucin hypersecretion both in vitro and in vivo (colon of KChIP3-/- mice). KChIP3 thus emerges as a high-affinity Ca++ sensor to control baseline mucin secretion. We have identified a glycosyltransferase FUT8 that controls the viscoelastic properties of mucins. Defects in FUT8 are observed in patients with ulcerative colitis. Another gene from our collection is helping us address the long-standing question of how cells supervise the biphasic release propensity of secretory granules. | | | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Biotic interactions and abiotic factors (such as climatic and edaphic conditions) jointly drive ecosystem patterns and processes. At the same time, biotic interactions are influenced by and can influence abiotic factors. Therefore, predicting ecosystem responses to ongoing global changes including the decline in biodiversity and climate-change requires understanding how biotic and abiotic factors interactively affect ecosystem patterns and processes. In this talk, I will discuss some findings from my PhD research wherein I examined how herbivores and pathogens affect grassland responses to global environmental changes. In particular, first I will discuss how fungal pathogens that are often overlooked in grassland ecosystems shape the vegetation community and ecosystem functions. Second, I will share findings from a climate-change experiment in Asian highlands and how herbivores affect grassland responses to climatic changes. Next, I will discuss some upcoming work that builds upon these studies as well as other new research directions. The first of these studies, in collaboration with a national grassland research network, will examine the role that insect herbivores and foliar fungal pathogens play in structuring grasslands across a range of environmental conditions. The second study will examine how declining snowfall, which drives primary productivity in high-altitude grasslands, affects vegetation dynamics and nutrient cycling processes. Finally, I will share ideas for a new research direction in which I will examine some of these questions using theoretical models. Specifically, I will explore how incorporating nutrient recycling due to biotic interactions in existing biodiversity theory affects ecosystem scale patterns over ecological and evolutionary time scales. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Calcium functions as a key molecule at the interface of neuronal excitability and cellular signaling in neurons. The Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) which is an ER-resident Ca2+ sensor and an important component of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is a key regulator of neuronal Ca2+ signaling and mGluR mediated synaptic transmission in Purkinje neurons. Previous work has reported altered intrinsic plasticity of Purkinje neurons and impaired cerebellar motor behaviour in mice with abolished STIM1 in Purkinje neurons. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying changes due to altered levels of SOCE components in the context of mammalian neurons remain unexplored. In my talk, I will demonstrate the molecular and cellular basis underlying STIM1 regulation of mammalian Purkinje neuron function. Our study demonstrated that Purkinje neurons with loss of STIM1 affected the neuronal excitability and motor coordination ability in the mice model [1,3]. We also observed that loss of STIM1-mediated calcium signaling affected the expression of genes related to neurite development and synaptic organization networks in Purkinje neurons in an age-dependent manner. Moreover, gene expression changes correlated with altered patterns of dendritic morphology and greater innervations of climbing fiber neuron dendrites in ageing STIM1PKO mice [1]. Interestingly, our work also demonstrates that reduction or loss of Septin 7 which belongs to Septins (SEPT) subfamily (filament-forming GTPases) in Purkinje neurons with abolished STIM1 restored expression of a few subsets of genes belonging to calcium signaling and neuron projection development [2]. The rescue of gene expression was accompanied by normal climbing fiber- Purkinje neuron synapse numbers and an improved ability to learn a motor coordination task in ageing mice. Overall, my research work identifies STIM1 as an essential regulator of Ca2+ homeostasis and neuronal excitability required for an optimal transcriptional profile of Purkinje neurons with age. This work also identifies SEPT7 as a putative therapeutic target for various neurodegenerative diseases caused by loss STIM1 exhibit age-dependent changes in gene expression and synaptic components.

In nature, this is ensured with the help of proteins as they have the ability to control the relaxation processes in the chromophores. This research focuses on the chromophore Biliverdin (BV). BV-protein complexes are found across a wide spectrum ranging from viruses, bacteria to higher plants/animals and are involved in various biological functions .The current work deals with a fish protein Sandercyanin that modulates the behavior of BV. Sandercyanin-BV complex is produced seasonally in the fish Sander vitreus found in the Northern American lakes. The complex shows unusual red fluorescence on UV light excitation unlike free BV. Such a large difference in emission and excitation wavelength is generally not observed in proteins. Our main objective was to decipher the specific interaction(s) of protein with the BV that resulted in observed spectral features. We found that a single amino acid residue in SFP significantly controls the relaxation process and also plays a crucial role in conformational selection of BV. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (PIP2) is a signaling lipid primarily found on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane where it can regulate a wide array of subcellular functions. It has been proposed that functionally distinct pools of PIP2 underlie the ability of a single molecule to regulate such diverse functions with high fidelity but the mechanisms by which such pools might be generated and maintained remain disputed. One possible mechanism is that pools of PIP2, sub-serving distinctive functions are generated by unique phosphoinositide kinases at the plasma membrane. Drosophila photoreceptors express multiple phosphoinositide kinases that can generate PIP2; of these dPIP5K produces a unique, phospholipase C (PLC) sensitive pool of PIP2 required for sensory transduction. However, the mechanism by which dPIP5K is able to generate a PLC sensitive pool of PIP2 has not been established. In this study we show that the dPIP5K gene is alternately spliced to generate two protein isoforms (dPIP5KS and dPIP5KL) with a conserved lipid kinase domain but also an additional distinct C-terminal region. In vitro, dPIP5KL showed PI4P 5-kinase activity and in vivo, it is both necessary and sufficient to support PIP2 turnover during phototransduction. dPIP5KS does not show an in vitro catalytic activity but suppresses the kinase activity of dPIP5KL and its in vivo functions. Hence, the two isoforms of dPIP5K regulate distinct biochemical functions during PLC signaling. We also show that the activity of dPIP5KL in vitro is enhanced by depletion of PNUT, a non-redundant subunit of the septin family of GTP binding proteins and in vivo, depletion of pnut rescues the effect of dPIP5KL depletion on the light response and PIP2 resynthesis during PLC signalling. Lastly, we find that depletion of Septin Interacting Protein 1 (Sip1), previously shown to bind PNUT, phenocopies the effect of dPIP5KL depletion in vivo. Thus, our work defines a septin 7 and Sip1 mediated mechanism through which PIP5K activity is coupled to ongoing PLC mediated PIP2 depletion. We have identified novel regulators of lipid kinase activity during G protein coupled PLC signaling. Overall, our work provides exciting new evidence on the molecular mechanism by which cells sense PIP2 levels and trigger activation of lipid synthesis. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| To be announced | | Brains have evolved as balanced networks of excitation and inhibition. The assembly of balanced networks requires the establishment of appropriate numbers of interneurons during early post-natal development. The mechanisms through which this occurs remain poorly understood. Here, investigating nascent cortical and striatal circuits, I will demonstrate that activity dependant input-specific mechanisms play a key role in establishing appropriate ratios of excitation and inhibition. Next, I will discuss the consequences of perturbing these developmental processes and show that abnormal neuron numbers lead to modified behaviours. Finally, I will give an overview of the research program that I will carry out at the NCBS. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| The cell plasma membrane and its underlying actin cytoskeleton play a central role in providing mechanical stability, enabling vesicle transport, cell migration and cell division. My research interest lies in the understanding of the molecular and physical principles that govern these processes at the plasma membrane. To study these processes systematically, we use reconstituted minimal systems of the membrane - cortex interface and cell experiments. In combination with high-resolution microscopy and quantitative image analysis, this allows us to dissect and understand the interlinked contributions of membrane mechanics, cytoskeletal activity, and membrane organisation. Here, I will present our new findings about 'Curly', an N-terminal part of IQGAP proteins that binds actin and leads to the bending of individual actin filaments into tight rings when anchored to planar lipid membranes. We identified the Curly module within IQGAP1 (human), rng2 (S. Pombe) and iqg1 (S. Cervisiae). Membrane anchored Curly induces formation of F-actin rings of radii less than a micrometre and recognizes F-actin orientation. Decoration of actin filaments with the tropomyosin Cdc8 increases ring formation, while Fimbrin abrogates it. Addition of myosin II motors leads to the contraction of these actin rings, making it a minimal, four component contractile ring system. In addition, expression of Curly in mammalian cells leads to an increase of tightly bend actin filament structures at the cortex and in the cytoplasm. The discovery of Curly provides a new opportunity to address and control the curvature of actin filaments in cells and in vitro and will open new approaches to generate synthetic cells capable of division and controlled shape changes. | | Central to life is the propagation of genetic material. Cells constantly face the threat of DNA damage. Incorrectly repaired or unrepaired damage can lead to mutations, loss of genetic information, or even cell death. Thus, cells must ensure faithful duplication and segregation of DNA across generations. The importance of this process is highlighted by the presence of checkpoints to regulate cell cycle progression and cell division, coupled to surveillance for genome maintenance. Checkpoints for genome integrity are universally conserved across domains of life, as are the mechanisms for repair and error correction. However, although repair is essential for genome maintenance, some pathways are also sources of mutagenesis. Hence, repair pathway choice is regulated to (i) ensure that the appropriate pathway is employed during repair, and (ii) control activity of error-free and error-prone systems to ensure balance between genome integrity maintenance and rates of stress-induced mutagenesis. This becomes particularly relevant in microbial systems that live in constantly fluctuating environments, where modulation of these pathways can have a significant impact on cellular adaptation and survival under stress. While DNA damage responses and repair pathways have been well-studied in isolated contexts in vitro, their dynamics, mechanisms of action, and regulation in a living cell are still active areas of exploration. In our lab we study how genome maintenance mechanisms are coordinated and regulated in vivo in microbes. For this, we employ quantitative live-cell imaging techniques to follow repair in real-time, in conjunction with genetic and molecular tools to introduce specific perturbations. In this talk, I will share some of our recent efforts to understand how specific steps of DNA damage response and repair are regulated in microbial systems. | | Archives at the National Centre for Biological Sciences Public Lecture Series https://www.ncbs.res.in/events/apls 50th edition Monthly talks framed around explorations in and around archives. Discussions by artists, archivists, academics, lawyers, teachers, journalists and others. Forty Years an Archive Rat in Five Continents Ramachandra Guha sociology, Ramachandra Guha became a historian by chance, after a village elder in Uttarakhand told him an unlikely tale of peasant protest that he found confirmation of in the archives. This was in 1982. For the next four decades, Guha has scoured archives around the world, in search of materials for his books and essays. He has done research in archival repositories in different parts of India, the UK, and the USA, and in Israel, South Africa, and Australia. He has worked in government archives, university manuscript collections, company record rooms, and newspaper offices, and consulted personal collections held in private hands. This talk will recall some professional and personal highlights from those journeys. Guha will speak of different kinds of primary sources; government documents, personal letters, diaries, court records, fugitive newspaper reports, etc, providing illustrations of the insights each can provide into our past. Much of this work was done before the invention of the World Wide Web, when one had to go physically to an archive to know what it contained, and when one had to take notes by hand. He will end his talk with reflections on how the digital age simultaneously makes the historian's job easier as well as less enjoyable.

Whether all microglia can attain any required functionality, or whether there are dormant microglial subsets, poised to perform specialized functions has been a question of keen interest in the field. It is also unclear if and how microglia revert back to their original state after performing specialized functions. With these broad questions in mind, we examined microglia through the lens of a transcription factor, Tcf4 (Transcription factor 4). We focused on Tcf4 given its neuro-immune relevance. While Tcf4 function in brain development and neurological diseases is well-known, recent studies from our lab have identified important cell-specific functions of Tcf4 in the healthy adult brain. Formerly, Tcf4 was shown to regulate and maintain cellular fate of a blood cell type through regulation of cellular form and function. Given the relevance of functional-fate changes for microglia, we asked if Tcf4 could be involved. For this, we first characterized Tcf4 expression in microglia, which showed that while early-postnatal and aged-brain microglia express Tcf4, adult brain microglia in minimal Tcf4 expression. However, adult microglia up-regulate Tcf4 expression during injury-response, suggesting a context-specific role for Tcf4 in microglia. To test the function of Tcf4 using a loss-of-function strategy, we planned to use the Cre-LoxP system to conditionally delete Tcf4 in microglia. Surprisingly, we discovered a biological caveat in a widely used inducible-deletion system for microglia, the Cx3cr1-CreER system. This work demonstrated how chromatin accessibility, based on the cellular-state, could cause unwanted Cre-mediated DNA-damage. We demonstrated that Cx3cr1-mediated Cre induction, specifically in neonatal microglia, causes DNA damage leading to aberrant microglia development and function, while adult microglia are unaffected by Cre induction. In the final segment of my dissertation, I investigated the question of microglial functional heterogeneity and cell-fate during injury-response using single-cell transcriptomics. This study indicates the presence of distinct functional subsets of microglia and a potential role of Tcf4 in tissue recovery. Overall, my studies uncover a potentially important regulator of microglia and provide conceptual insights into microglia heterogeneity. As a tangent study, my work also identifies a hidden caveat of the Cre-LoxP system, emphasizing correct use of controls and providing useful strategies for microglial gene-manipulation using currently existing tools.
