There's nothing better in the world for hitting that reset button on life, finding yourself on the road ahead, and discovering inner peace. For such a wonderful occasion, you want to make sure you are getting the perfect retreat for yourself. After all...this is your vacation. Look not only at yoga retreats, but check out events with daily yoga classes that have the yoga style and other elements you want. Look at titles like yoga retreats, of course, but don't discount a [wellness retreat](https://bookretreats.com/s/wellness-retreats), a [meditation retreat](https://bookretreats.com/s/meditation-retreats) [ mindfulness retreat](https://bookretreats.com/s/meditation-retreats/mindfulness-retreats), even a [forest bathing](https://bookretreats.com/s/wellness-retreats/forest-bathing-retreats) hiking retreat with sound healing guided meditation to find exactly your sweet spot. Because these days your perfect retreat in a spectacular place you'll remember fondly forever awaits you. We'd love to make that happen for all world nomads and the yogi in you, so here are surefire ways to choose your best yoga retreat on planet Earth. If you're going on vacation, the first thing you want to think about is...where do you want to go? Do you want to be [by the beach](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/beach-retreats), near the [mountains](https://bookretreats.com/s/other-retreats/mountain-retreats), in the [forest](https://bookretreats.com/s/other-retreats/forest-retreats), amongst [nature](https://bookretreats.com/s/other-retreats/nature-retreats), where there is [tropical weather](https://bookretreats.com/s/other-retreats/tropical-retreats), or cool weather, on an [island](https://bookretreats.com/s/other-retreats/island-retreat), in the [city](https://bookretreats.com/s/wellness-retreats/urban-retreats), etc? Ask yourself this question: what surrounding area would help my yoga practice thrive? You want to be in a place where the daily yoga classes for guests are as conducive as possible for you to truly excel, and go deep within yourself. If you want to bask on the beach in your off time, you might consider places like [Bali](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/bali), [Thailand](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/thailand) (Koh Samui, Koh Phangan), [Costa Rica](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/costa-rica) (magnificent stretches of beaches are on both its Pacific and Caribbean sides), [Mexico](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/mexico), or [Hawaii](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/hawaii). Are you ok being in a place where English isn't the main language? If that would disrupt your relaxation, then consider finding a retreat in the [United States](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/united-states) (big names retreat centers are Esalen Institute at Big Sur, California south of San Francisco and north of Santa Barbara, Shambhala Mountain Center in Colorado, Omega Institute in NY, and Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health in Massachusetts.), [United Kingdom](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/united-kingdom) (the [Glass House Retreat in Essex](https://bookretreats.com/center/the-glasshouse-detox-and-wellness-retreat) for a wellness holiday is a winner for fitness classes, detox and relaxation), [Canada](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/canada), [New Zealand](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/new-zealand), or [ Australia](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/australia). In [Sri Lanka](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/sri-lanka), English is fluently spoken, especially for official and business purposes. Remember back in school when you had that teacher who was so inspiring that it totally changed the way you interacted with a certain subject? That's the power a good, professional yoga teacher has. A great teacher can inspire you and other retreat guests to heights beyond which you didn't think possible. A crappy yoga instructor can sour you on a subject (unfortunately). Make sure you get a good feeling about your yoga teacher. Check out reviews if they have any. If you've attended a basic yoga class at a yoga studio with them already, do you want to go deeper with them into yoga, guided meditation sessions or other wellness activities on a yoga holiday? In the end, it's best to make a decision with your intuition on this one. You're probably a good judge of people. What do you want in your retreat? It's a good idea to truly ask yourself this question. What am I looking to get out of this retreat? If you want to just relax on a beautiful beach, you definitely don't want to choose a [weight loss retreat](https://bookretreats.com/s/wellness-retreats/weight-loss-retreats) or a [hiking retreat](https://bookretreats.com/s/other-retreats/hiking-retreats) in the mountains. Maybe you do want spa treatments on a [healing retreat](https://bookretreats.com/s/other-retreats/hiking-retreats), and that's that. But you may want to go deeper into your practice, unplug from the craziness, recharge your batteries, be inspired to start a daily routine, lose weight, learn more about a certain yoga style like [Hatha yoga](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/hatha-yoga) or [Vinyasa just chill out with a [Restorative yoga](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/restorative-yoga) class or some [Nidra Yoga](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/nidra-yoga). Whatever it is you want, make a short list of the best yoga retreats in alignment with that. You'll be spending real quality time with like minded people who resonate with the same things, and true friendships can come out of the best [wellness, meditation and yoga retreats](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/yoga-and-meditation-retreats). We pay for the things we value most. When we truly want something, we always find a way to make it happen. If you're working so hard, you deserve to look at [affordable yoga retreats](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/affordable-yoga-retreats) that will truly bring you back to center. At BookRetreats.com you now have access to filters enabling traveling yogis to set a price range, and only see retreats that fit their budget. For example, If you're looking for a retreat under $1200, just use the slider and set the maximum to $1200. You'll save time by filtering out all the retreats that are over what you want to spend. You can also use the \"Sort By Lowest Price\" option. That will sort all the retreats by the lowest price. We often have retreats as low as $150-$200, so we've got something for every budget. But it's not always advisable to go for a cheap yoga retreat just because it seems too good to be true (which means, it probably is). It's best to choose exactly what you want and find a way to make that happen. You may be surprised that you can afford some [luxury yoga retreats](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/luxury-retreats) and get you the yoga vacation of a lifetime. That being said, it's important to double check whether the retreat price includes lodging and food. Most do, but you never want to assume... Remember the cost of your flight ticket as well. Here's a nice tip: some retreats can be cheaper in the low season when not so many tourists are in the area. Another money-saving tip: some retreats offer options for lodging such as a shared room or dorm, which can give a nice price saving. And if you're the outdoorsy type who likes [camping retreats](https://bookretreats.com/s/other-retreats/camping-retreats) with hiking and your yoga and meditation session in the forest, there are additional savings for sleeping in a tent or van. Do you just want to get away for a [weekend retreat](https://bookretreats.com/s/other-retreats/weekend-retreats)? Or do you want to take a week and really go deep into your practice? There's no doubt that you can touch places within yourself on longer retreats that are often not touched in a short break retreat. But you might simply be needing a weekend to touch base. Only you know. The wonderful thing is that you have a ton of options. Are you the high-flying kind with impeccable taste and a disdain for anything that crawls in the night? I wouldn't choose a camping option for your lodging. Do you need a room by yourself for absolute sanctuary? Or would you love the company of another person to make the journey with? Will you starve without Wi-Fi or is unplugging the exact thing you're looking for? Do you want a pool nearby, with massage therapists on staff at the retreat? Or do you just want to do some yoga and can care less about the rest? If you do a week-long retreat you'll be spending a LOT of time with other people, and a significant amount of time doing a certain yoga style. Make sure it's the right style for you. If you want a stronger, more powerful style of yoga then you might want something like [Ashtanga](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/ashtanga-yoga) or [Power yoga](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/power-yoga). If you are wanting a more gentle, fluid class then [Yin yoga](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/yin-yoga), [Vinyasa flow](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/vinyasa-yoga), or maybe [Nidra yoga](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/nidra-yoga) might suit you better. If you're new to yoga, you'll want to ensure that the retreat [serves beginners](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/yoga-retreats-for-beginners) with a good well rounded Hatha yoga practice. Thankfully, most retreats cater to people of all skill levels. But it's a common fear about not being flexible enough. The best way to calm that fear is simply to contact the retreat and ask. Do you want an early morning yoga class, then have the rest of the day for yourself for outdoor activities in nature or fitness on your own? Or a double yoga session daily, with [detox](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/detox-retreats), [spa treatments](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/spa-retreats) or massage therapy in between? Ask yourself how important it is to have meditation included. Do you want to learn more through guided meditation? Is chanting and singing kirtan a must for you? Evaluate the actual program of the retreat to see if it matches what you'd like your schedule to be. Here is a truism if there ever was one: Good food doesn't necessarily guarantee a great yoga retreat, but bad meals can sink even the finest yoga retreat experience. So get a real understanding of the food situation beforehand. One of the best things about yoga retreats can be the delicious (usually) [vegetarian meals](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/vegetarian-retreats). If you're vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free, you can check the proposed menu of the retreat. A yoga retreat or detox can be a great way to start new eating habits, and lose some unneeded weight in the process. Having a week of exercise, nurturing, and healthy eating at a living retreat center can do wonders for the natural health of the system. It can be an opportunity to step into a healthier interaction with the daily meals you choose in everyday life. Or just a delicious week of tasting local cuisine that you can't wait to eat (because you've been thinking about it for the entire practice). If you want a lot of personal attention from the teachers, it's better to go for a retreat with smaller numbers of people. If you want to make friends and aren't bothered by a large group, then you don't really have to concern yourself with the size. Some people are troubled by larger groups and a yoga retreat or meditation retreat can have anywhere from 3 - 50+ people in them. 10-25 is often a nice sweet spot that brings a variety of people, without being too overwhelming. Most retreat centers differ in their cancellation policies. It's standard to require a deposit of at least 15%, and often up to 50%. Because a retreat center wants to fill their retreats, they will often put a cut off date for when they will give a refund. This can be anywhere from 0 days to 3 months, so make sure to read the cancelation policy of your desired yoga, wellness, meditation retreat or yoga teacher training very carefully. It's no fun for anyone if this is skimmed over and misunderstandings occur. Double and triple-check to make sure you understand it correctly. Can't forget this one right?? You're planning an absolutely awesome time in your life and the planning process can be super fun too. Dreaming of all the wonderful times you'll have, the people you'll meet, the absolute sanctuary and inner peace you'll feel. Go ahead and imagine it all... ..and now go make it happen! Welcome to a relaxed Costa Rican tropical yoga escape! The groups here are intentionally kept small to give the yoga teachers more time to spend with the students.

Welcome to a 5 day retreat opportunity enabling you to walk part of the Camino and experience it first-hand. Check out what a previous retreat walker had to say: \"I had the wonderful privilege to attend the camino walking retreat. Going into the retreat my only intention was to walk in nature and get a break from the stress of daily life. What I got in return was a lot more than what I hoped for. I learned a thing or two about mindfulness and I am now equipped with some tools which should hopefully help to manage the stress of modern life. Needless to say, the whole experience was very nourishing and I can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.\" Let's go to Goa! I just had to say that :-) But seriously folks, this all-inclusive yoga holiday on the beach in tropical and laid back Goa, India may be the bargain of the century.
