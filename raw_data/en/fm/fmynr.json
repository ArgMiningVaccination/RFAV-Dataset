[A recent BMJ Open paper](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/7/e072619) sheds light on some of the reasons behind this hesitancy. A review of findings indicated that self-described vaccine-hesitant adults in Black and Latinx communities shared similar concerns about safety and efficacy, as well as the effects of structural racism on a community's risk of infection and vaccine access. The paper's authors also suggested steps to help clinicians overcome misperceptions and improve vaccine uptake. The authors conducted two secure online bulletin boards: one each for Black and Latinx communities. Each community consisted of 30 people who were not categorically opposed to vaccines, but were undecided about whether it was safe to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Researchers asked each participant a series of open-ended questions. After answering, participants could see how others answered the same question and were free to respond to what the rest of the community had posted. Participants were reminded to log back in periodically for possible follow-up questions over three days, with different sets of questions posted each morning and afternoon. The authors categorized responses into five main themes, which they noted \"were remarkably similar\" among Black and Latinx participants: Story Highlights Although participants in both groups acknowledged structural racism as a factor that could influence a community's risk of infection or ability to access COVID-19 vaccines, they did not cite structural issues as contributing to their own personal risk of infection or their individual decision to be vaccinated. Moreover, the public health benefits often associated with vaccination (such as protecting vulnerable communities or reducing the spread of disease) were not mentioned as motivating factors for receiving the vaccine. It should be noted that the bulletin boards were conducted in July 2021, before the FDA gave full approval of COVID-19 vaccines and before COVID-19 booster shots became available. Despite the age of the comments, the study authors said that the results remain important because they \"provide insight into important drivers of vaccine hesitancy in Black and Latinx communities\" and \"may help inform strategies to support future vaccine demand as new health care challenges inevitably arise.\" The authors proposed several strategies for improving vaccine uptake, including: \"In summary, bulletin boards with COVID-19 vaccine-hesitant people from the Black and Latinx communities revealed that the major factors influencing vaccine hesitancy involve fears of lack of safety and efficacy of the vaccines,\" the authors concluded. \"Future research will focus on strategies to improve vaccine acceptance that do not rely only on providing facts but account also for the anxieties and fears that motivate vaccine hesitancy.\" As COVID-19 [hospitalizations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklyhospitaladmissions_select_00) and [ER visits](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#ed-visits_separated_by_age_group) continue to trend upward, it's important that clinicians have a variety of tools to support conversations with patients about the vaccines. A good starting point is [a recent FPM feature article](/pubs/fpm/issues/2023/0300/vaccine-hesitancy.html) that offers several tips for effective conversations with vaccine-hesitant patients. Family physicians also have access to the AAFP's [educational series](/cme/all/online/improving-vaccine-confidence.html) on improving vaccine confidence, which features more than a dozen on-demand sessions. Other resources include [an FPM supplement](/pubs/fpm/issues/2023/0700/bivalent-covid-vaccination.html) on COVID-19 vaccines, a collection of fact sheets and patient educational materials on the AAFP's [Immunizations and Vaccines webpage, ](/family-physician/patient-care/prevention-wellness/immunizations-vaccines.html)a familydoctor.org [Doctors' Notes](https://familydoctor.org/covid-vaccine-information/) feature on talking with patients about COVID-19 vaccines, and [an updated familydoctor.org article](https://familydoctor.org/the-importance-of-vaccinations/) "}
