By: Graham Brant-Zawadzki Stanford University, Stanford, CA SIT: Tibetan Studies, Fall 2005 1Disclaimer First, Tibetan medicine opera tes on two functioning levels: 1) The Dharmic : Healing by tantric ritual which includes mantras and ceremonial rites, exorcism, and other religious practices1. This form of healing can only be pref ormed by high lamas 2) The Mundane : The material form of Tibetan healing consisting of medicine, acupuncture, massage, etc. In this paper, we are principally concerned with the later. The Dharmic level will not be compared to allopathic medicine due to prac ticality, lack of equiva lent terminologies and concepts in western medicine. Furthermore, all Tibetan terms will be spe lled out phonetically, but to avoid confusion Tibetan spellings will be provided in Ti betan in Appendix 1.

This mechanistic ideology, dubbed reductionism, finds its roots in the mathematical th eories of Newton, the philosophy of Descartes, and the methodological approaches proposed by Francis Bacon.2 The culmination of these ideologies lead to the belief that all complex syst ems could be understood and ultimately mastered by reducing them to their basic elements. Some texts, including Fritjof Capra's The Turning Point3 argue that once classical physicists established this type of thought, the other sciences, includ ing medicine, simply followed suit and came to accept the attitude as law. Today, the modern western, or allopathic, medical system continues to deal with diseases and treatments according to what's become known as the \"doctrine of single causation.\" As it implies, this ideology leads western doctors to seek a\\out and isolate specific causes for an ailment. Treatment, then, revolves around the elimination of that problem from the complex system which incorporates it. Consequen tially, despite a quick and precise cessation of the ailment, the overall function of the system may be affected. These side effects can range from acceptable (drowsiness, sensitivity etc. ) to debilitating and even fatal. 2 Drummer pg.127 3 Capra 7The East However, on the other side of the planet, some cultures took an entirely different approach in understanding the nature of the worl d. In large part due to powerful Buddhist influences, the Tibetan people came to appreciate the complex systems of our planet as a whole. These seemingly utterly interwoven relationships were valued for their function, not the \"materia l sub-strata of which they were composed\", but the synergy they created.4 The Tibetan people possessed a solid understanding of the intricate relationships they observed in the natural world and were sensitive to the effects brought on by changes in that world (including ch anges in time of day, temperature, season, etc.). So it comes as no surprise that Tibetan medicine developed a view of the human body, with its intricate anatomical, philosophical, and intellectual functions, as a micr ocosm of the natural relationships all around them. Tibetans understood disease as an imbalance within the functioning body and thus \"healing is effected by restoring the lost equilibrium and not by symptomatic treatment of a particular organ.\"5 Furthermore, Tibetan doctors are much more concerned with using symptoms and an understanding of these functions in order to identify the primary cause, or root, of a disease, going beyond the problem to find its much more subtle origins. Their texts state that symptoms are cau sed by a sort of 'chain reaction' of events within the body emanating from the primary cause. As a result, diagnosis may require proper environmental set ting and timing, while therapies can take significant time and patience as treating the entire system requires much more subtle and sensitive methods than we see in the west. 4 Finckh pg. 9 5 Ibid 8So Why Tremors? While the theories governing th ese two modern medical systems evolved from vastly different foundations, it is in practice that conflicts become most apparent. Through studying and comparing the alternate methods used to define and treat the di sease, we can better comp rehend each tradition as a whole (thereby using both reductionist and holistic perspectives). Yet to obtain such a thorough understanding, we must study an appropriate disease; one which exem plifies the inherent conflicts between the two ideologies, while concurrently shedding light on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach to treatment. The esse ntial tremor provides us just that . While tremors have afflicted mankind for thousands of years (ancient texts from both cultures acknowledge the ailment), it's only within the last century that western medicine has begun to truly understand and effectively treat the disease. This current curiosity leaves many res earchers more open to reco gnizing and investigating alternative theories. Additionally, current treatment s used by each tradition couldn't be more typical. Western methods involve invasive surgeries and/or harsh pharmaceuticals which promise rapid results, although sometimes accompanied by serious side eff ects. Meanwhile, Tibetan methods are slow, holistic, and organic, but can take months to years to gradually show results. Perhaps most significant is the fact that allopathic me dicine offers no actual cure for tremors, only treatments which may alleviate symptoms, while Tibetan physicians claim they can ultimately offer a complete cure. Thus, the essential tremor provides us with the perfec t lens through which we can analyze these complex traditions. 9Part I Defining the Disease In the West: Introduction Allopathic medicine cites the essential tremor as the most common movement disorder (a neurological condition which le ads to involuntary movements th roughout the body) afflicting human beings today.6 Fist documented by James Parkinson as an \"involuntary tremulous motion\" tremors are defined by western medicine today as a \"rhythmic, involuntary, oscill ating movement of a body part in isolation or as part of a clinical syndrome.\"7 Although the disease is not lif e-threatening, it can lead to serious functional and social disability. In order to fully grasp the allopathic perspectiv e of the disease, we must first attain a base understanding of the fundamental relationship between the human neural and muscular functions. The Western Brain The human brain is characterized by four main regions, or 'lobes:' the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital; with each contributing to neural functioning in a va riety of ways. Every voluntary movement made by our bodies originates in these structures, most specifically, in the primary cortex. Also known as the motor cortex (or primar y motor cortex, P.M.C.), this area forms a band separating the frontal and pa rietal lobes of the brain.8 To carry out movement, the motor cortex receives information from sensory neurons throughout the brain. This information includes the body's position in space (from the parietal l obe), goals ad strategies for m ovement (from the frontal lobe), memories of past strategies (from the temporal lobe), etc. These signals are sent deep within the cortex 6 www.ninds.com/tremor 7 Sweeny 8 Dubuc: The the basal ganglia, a group of neuronal structures. Once these have processed the complex information, they compile it into a signal, which is then channeled through the thalamus, back to the cortex, and on to the motor neurons.9 These motor neurons function like most nerve cells. Each is capable of creating an electronic impulse known as an action potential. This electroni c charge travels down the neurons to the synaptic cleft, where it stimulates the release of neurotrans mitters, chemical signals that can be picked up by adjacent neurons. These signals can either cause or prevent the next neurons in the chain from firing10. Different regions of the P.M.C. correspond to and control different parts of the body. Thus, these signals may originate from a variety of areas in the P.M.C.. A chain reaction carries these signals from neuron to neuron from the sensory somatic branch of th e nervous system to the skeletal muscle fibers. The signal terminates at the neuromuscular junction (the junction between th e last motor neuron, and the muscular fibers).11 In a healthy brain, voluntary movement requires instantaneou s processing on three distinct levels. First, the brain analyzes the task at hand and selects and appr opriate response. Then it plans the movement in physical terms, ad finally activates the motor neurons to execute movement. We can think of the thalamus as the last 'check point' for the processed in formation before it is sent on the motor neurons. Basically, the region acts like a bottleneck through which most of the messages sent from the brain to various muscles of the body must pass. Due to the integral ro le these structures play in determining various aspects of our movement, thei r malfunctioning can result in trembling, difficulty initiating or terminating movement, et c; in other words, tremors. 9 Dubuc: Making a Voluntary Movement 10 Freudenrich: Basic Neuron Types simply a type of synapse 11 Freudenrich: How Muscles Work\" 11 The Western Tremor Allopathic systems characterize tremors accord ing to both symptoms and etiology (causation) Despite the cause, tremors may manifest in a vari ety of ways, the most commonly believed causes of tremor and their manifestations can be found in a ppendix 2, but for the purposes of our study, we will focus on essential tremors. The specific mech anisms thought to produce essential tremor (among possible combinations of others ) are referred to as 'central oscillators.' These are \"Groups of cells in the central nervous system present in the thalamus, basal ganglia, and inferior olive. These cells have the capacity to fire re petitively and produce tremor. Parkinsonian tremor may possibly originate in basal ganglia, and essential tremor w ithin the inferior olive and thalamus.\"12 Prevalence of the disease vari es greatly depending on type and population. The highest recorded rates are found in central Asia with 5.6% of some populations afflicted. The disease shows a pattern of autosomal dominance, and thus family history is identified in over 60% of patients.13 So, with over ten possible pathological causes a nd five distinct symptomatic expressions, all driven by at least four pathophysio logical mechanisms, allopathic medicine cites at least two hundred different types of tremors. This meticulous categori zation is the result of discovering incredible details of the inner workings of the body, an d is a perfect representation of the reductionist approach. But, allopathic medicine is by no means the only, or ev en the first medical system to characterize and categorize the tremor. In Tibet: Tremors may also occur as a result of problems within the muscular fibers themselves, but these problems are usually a result of the effects of drugs or toxins. 12 Sweeny 13 ibid 12Tradition For centuries before Parkinson published his essay on the 'shaking palsy,' Tibetan doctors treated patients afflicted by an identical disease known in their culture as Tsakar , literally \"disease of the white nerves,\" but referred to as \"the shaking limb disease.\"14 The foundational text of the Tibetan medical tradition, the rGyud-bZhi15 or 'the four treatises.' As with allopathic medicine, to fully appreciate the Tibetan perspectiv e, we must review its foundations and the evolution of thought regarding the disease. Traditionally, \"the Buddha, in his manifestation of the Buddha of medicine, is regarded as the originator of Tibetan Medicine.16 The rGyud-bZhi is in turn regarded as a dialogue between two manifestations of the Buddha of medicine, one taking the form of the Buddha's mind, and the other the Buddha's speech. The text is written in the form of questions and answers regarding the nature and treatment of all disease.17 Recorded history paints a slightly di fferent picture. While modern Tibetan medicine is wholly interwoven with Buddhism, evidence shows that medical practice existed in Tibet long before the religion swept the region. This original practice was instead influenced by the shamanistic and bon religions. 18 As their heritages were rich in astrological principles, these found their way into medical practice of the day. The practices faded with the establishment of Buddhism as a state religion, the extent to whic h they influenced modern Tibetan medicine is unclear (although there is little doubt Tibetan astrology sprang from such origins).19 The Tibetan medical tradition we know today se ems to have originated between 348-468 c.a., with the arrival of two great Indian healers Biji Gaje and Bilh a Gaje, during the rain of the 28th king 14 Jimmy Lama 17/11 15 Jimmy Lama 17/11; Tsepak 20/11; Finckh pg. 19 rGyud-bZhi is an abbreviation of the full name of the text. It is also translated as 'the four tantras,' 'the ambrosia heart tantra,' 'the Secret Treatise of Instructions on the Eight-Branched Essence of Mortality,' and other names. 16 Khangkar pg. 8 17 Tsepak 22/11 18 Finckh pg. 8; Kangkar pg. 10 with considerable influence from Chinese and Indian astrological concepts as well 19 Saanga 18/11 13Lha Thotho RI Nyantsen. The king was so impressed by their abilities that he provided his daughter as a bride to Biji. In the early 7th century c.a., the 33rd king Songtsen Gampo invited the eminent physicians Bhardvaj from India, and Han Wang Hang De from China to share their knowledge with Tibetan physicians. One Hundred years later, ki ng Trison-Deutson convened what was probably the world's first medical conference at Samye, Tibet. Top physicians from India, China, Persia, East Turkistan, and Nepal discussed theory a nd compared medical systems for days.20 Yuthog Yonta Gonpo (personal physician to the king and member of the Yuthog lineage) re presented Tibet, and evidence suggests that he \"synthesized the best of the then known medical systems and re-wrote [or wrote] the rGyud-bZhi .\"21 The work has since been passed down through the generations, remaining the basis for the etiology of disease and the syst ems of diagnosis and therapy in Tibetan medicine today. Disease in Tibetan Medicine: A (very) brief summary of rGyud-bZhi As previously mentioned, health in Tibetan medicines is based upon equilibrium between the elements of which we are composed. Our bodies ar e thought to consist of th ree principal systems or humors: rlung (Wind) , thre-pa poisons' which lead to suffering: ded-chags (attachment), Zhe-dsang (hatred) and gTi-mug (delusions) respectively; and all of which are born fr om ignorance, the root of all suffering.22 In a healthy body, these humors are all in balance, but a disturbance in on e or more results in illness. Disturbances may arise from diet, behavior, or environmental factors, but these are known as secondary Thus beginning the famous 'Yuthog' medical lineage whose descendents served as personal physicians to the kings of Tibet for generations and whose works dominate Tibetan medical texts 20 Men-Tsee-Khang pg. 5 21 ibid pg 6 22 Saanga 16/11 14causes ( Kyen). The root of disease itself, or the primary cause ( Kyu) lies dormant within all of us, it is only when activated by a secondary cause that the kyu causes an imbalance resulting in illness.23 The Tibetan Tsakar In the case of Tsakar , Tibetan physicians cite an imbalance in rlung.24 rlung is believed to be responsible for all movement within the body: br eathing, circulation, even neural signaling and consciousness (it is often refe rred to as the horse carrying 'riders' throughout the body).25 There are five types of rlung, each contributing to specific bodily functions; for example, kyab-che rlung \"pervades from the brain to the toes... it helps in the extension of limbs, muscular action... and smooth performance of bodily functions,\"26 and a disorder in which may result in Tsakar . In addition to the character of these unseen forces, a doctor must unde rstand the structure of both the body and the presenting diseas e. In this regard, Tibetan medi cine agrees w/ allopathics in classifying Tsakar as a nerve disease. According to the rGyud-bZhi \u00b8 all nerves ( tsa-nye ) originate at the soktra , the root of all nerves, located in the crown of the mead and a major rlung 'artery' connecting the lepa (brain) to the rest of the body.27 So, the nerves grow down form the soktsa and spread throughout the body 'like the roots of a tree.' Two main types of tsa-nye exist: inner tsa-nye which are unseen and connect to our internal organs, and outer tsa-nye which connect to the limbs and muscles, and thanks to which all controlled movement is possible (we will focus on the later).28 Secondary causes of Tsakar (like allopathic tremors) may vary, but include taksha (over exertion, and especially at young ages), rimdoh (as a result of epidemic disease), tso-pa (fever), tson (an injury inflicte d by a weapon), or lung-tuk (when the body gets shake n, i.e. driving down a bumpy We may think of it in terms of everyone hav ing the potential for disease, as opposed to western medicine where disease is introduced. 23 ibid 24 Jimmy Lama 18/11 25 Kangkar pg. 16 26 ibid 27 Tsepak 20/11 15road). All of these causes result in an imbalance of kyab-che rlung and lead to lekun (brain dysfunction) and Tsakar .29 Tsakar itself, like all diseases, is characterized according to two criteria: chi (general structure) and chetak (specific structure). General struct ure refers to whether a disease is a hot or cold disorder. Chronic diso rders tend to be thought of as 'col d' diseases, while new or 'fresh' disorders are said to be 'hot.' Treatment will depend on whether a patient has only recently been afflicted by Tsakar or if symptoms have persisted over time. Specific characteristic s are slightly more complex, and depend on location and humor. The disease, while originating in the brain, presents itself in other locations or Neh in the body; the head ( can arrive from wind, bile , phlegm, or a combination of the three known as tuba.30 Tsakar can present itself in a variety of ways based on this structure, with each manifestation requiring a specific treatment. Thus, while their methods and goals may differ, Tibetan and allopathic physicians alike must meticulously analyze symptoms to accura tely diagnose and effectively treat Tsakar/tremors respectively. 28 ibid 29 ibid 30 ibid 16Part II Treating Disease: From Diagnosis to Results As with any disease, a physician must have th e ability to recognize and understand specific symptoms of tremors/ Tsakar. The Allopathic Perspective Diagnosis As described in appendix 2, allopathic medicine perceives five ways in which tremors present: resting, postural, kinetic, task-s pecific, or terminal. While th ese would seem to be obvious and straightforward symptoms, they require careful observation and examination to accurately discern between. Thus, a diagnostic evaluation of a tremori ng patient must include a nd investigation into the patients clinical history, a clinic al examination, and consideration of possible differential diagnosis.31 A patients clinical history should reveal past \"tremor onset, duration, seve rity, affected areas, activation factors (possibly like t hose Tibetan physicians would expect) relieving factors, effects of alcohol [or other substances], family history, and associated symptoms.\"32 Most, if not all of this information is obtained from simply questioning the patient or close family/friends, and significantly contributes to the doctor's following examination, help ing to rule out some po ssibilities and directing tests towards more probable ones. The purpose of the clinical evaluation is to de termine tremor rating and frequency. First the patient must be observed in resting, non-tremulous state. The, the tremor should be measured when the patient assumes various positions, and during movement (the doctor pays special attention to gait, 31 Sweeny 17muscle tone, facial expression, and dexterity).33 In order to \"measure\" tr emor, allopathic physicians use a scale based on severity: 0- No Tremor 1- Slight Tremor 2- Moderate tremor (less than 2 cm excursion) 3- Marked tremor (2 cm to 4 cm excursion) 4- Severe tremor (more than 4 cm excursion)34 Additionally, both amplitude and freq uency of tremulous oscillations help to pinpoint and rule out possible causes. Not surprisingly, a laboratory wor kup is unnecessary for most tremor patients, but can be helpful in ruling our confounding factors or diseases. Electromyogram (EMG) and EEG recordings may also be helpful. Treatment and Results Essential and Parkinsons induced tremors are sl owly progressive disorder s. While allopathic medicine offers neither preventative therapies, nor a ny complete cures, a number of effective treatment options, both pharmaceutical and surgical, are availa ble. Unfortunately, these treatments may have serious side effects; in some cases the risk s of medication outweigh its potential benefits.35 Typically, treatment programs begin with either primdone or propranolol. Both drugs block the action of stimulant producing neurotransmitters, and are most effective for upper limb tremors, with 60-70% of 32 ibid especially important for ruling out other diseases such as parkinsons 33 ibid 34 ibid \"A thyroid function test is helpful to rule out hyperthyroidism in patients with signs of thyroid disease and tremor, particularly postural and action types. In young patients (younger than 40 years of age) with signs of parkinsonism and tremor, a serum copper, serum ceruloplasmin, 24-h urinary co pper, and slit-lamp examination is necessary to rule out Wilson's disease. To rule out systemic causes of tremor, such as hypoglycemia, liver disease, electrolyte imbalance, or drug abuse, appropriate tests should be ordered.\" (Sweeny) EEG: An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test to det ect abnormalities in the electrical activity of the brain EMG: Electromyography is a test that assesses the hea lth of the muscles and the nerves controlling the muscles. 35 Duma 18patients noticing a reduction in tremor amplitude.36 Side effects of Propranolol include fatigue, bradycardia (a slowed heart rhythm), and peripher al vasoconstriction (resu lting in a shortness of breath), among others. Primidone, while more effective (in many cases reducing tremor amplitude by 60-70%) may produce vomiting, sedation, vertigo, at axia (loss of coordination), and headache (although some suggest side effects can be avoided by beginning treatment at very low doses and then gradually increasing doses). If taking wither drug se parately is not effective, the two may be combined together or with an array of other drugs further described in appendix 3.37 If there is no benefit from standard pharmacological treatments (a s is the case for one out of four patients) localized injections of botulinum toxin may be used. Yet, for patients with \"severe, disabling, medication-refractory tremors\" (or for those unwilling to take the described medications every day for the rest of their lives) surgery is also an option.38 In the past, thalamotomy (the destruction or removal of a portion of the thalamus) was advocated for these patients, but today, a much more viable option is available: Deep Brain Stimulation (D.B.S.). As previously mentioned, most of the messages sent by our brain regarding body potion must pass through the thalamus. In patients with tr emors, these messages be corrupted and 'firing' improperly. D.B.S. involves implanting an insulated lead wire capable of el ectronic stimulation into the thalamus. The impulses can interrupt and slow the corrupted messaging system and suppress tremors as well rigidity and stiffness associated with Parkinsons disease. 39 State of the art MRI brain mapping and real time imaging in the operating ro om precisely determine the exact location for implantation within the thalamus. Once implanted, th e lead is activated, test ed, and tuned for optimal effectiveness (all while the patient is still on th e operating table and conscious). A pacemaker-like pulse generator is implanted in th e chest and connected to the wire. The entire procedure from brain 36 http://www.wemove.org/et/et_pt.html 37 ibid Botulinum toxin is made by the same bacterium that causes food poisoning. A high dose of botulinum toxin could be fatal, just as food poisoning can be fatal. 19mapping to recovery room takes 2-3 hours and full e ffectiveness of the treatm ent may be experienced immediately.40 However, risks and side effects, while ra re, are ever-present. Surgical risks include: internal bleeding (2%), leakage of fluid into the brain (1%), seizure (1%), and infection (2%).41 Side effects from therapy may include paresthesia (tingli ng in the limbs), paresis (facial or limb muscle weakening), dysarthia (speech problems), dizziness, coordination problems, or jolting/shocking sensations. The procedure boast an 85% rate for 'complete control' of tremors, 10% partial control, and only 1% complication rate (with a 5% 'presumed failure rate).42 Thus, it is easy to see the nature of allopathic medicine in the tr eatment of tremors. Therapy is powerful, efficient, and precise. The most cutting edge technology is utilized (at no small expense to patient/insurance company) and can produce instantaneous results. But, the bene fits only exist as long as treatment persists (in most cases indefinitely) a nd a vast spectrum of possibl e side effects looms over every option. However, for every patient each deta il, from diagnosis to observed results and side effects, is meticulously recorded and analyzed. These painstaking procedures allow researchers and physicians alike to see the successe s and failures of the past and de termine what methods failed and which ones show the most promise, thus giving allopa thic medicine the ability to learn from the past and continually evolve and constantly deve lop new and better healing techniques. Now that we've reviewed the allopathic treat ments, it comes as no surprise that Tibetan medicine takes a somewhat different approach to treating the disease. 38 Sweeny 39 Duma 40 ibid 41 ibid keeping in mind this is not a cure, as tr eatment must be constantly administered. 42 ibid 20The Tibetan Perspective Just like western physicians, Tibetan doctors spend decades learning about symptoms and methods of diagnosis, in which the staples of the Ti betan tradition (interdependence, holistics, etc.) are blatantly evident. Every factor, ev ery action, every aspect of the patient is considered a clue as to the nature and necessary treatment of the disease.43 To Tibetan practitioners, \"Cause and effect operate on every level -horizontally, vertically, and in combination. Nothing is unrelated a nd should it appear to be, it is only apparently by chance.\"44 Once again, before explaining the deta ils of diagnosis and treatment of Tsakar , it is essential we review and understand general Tibetan methods of each action. Diagnosis Traditionally, and today, Tibe tan medicine uses three methods of diagnosis, referred to as inspection, palpation, and inte rrogation; and combine to satisfy four major goals: 1.) Determine conditions and circumstances which lead to disease (incl uding activities, environments, etc.) 2.) Ascertain living and dietar y habits prior to illness 3.) Ascertain nature of present habits 4.) Assess and classify symptoms45 Inspection consists of two principal aspects: inspections of the tongue and inspection of the urine. In each case, physicians look for three distinct signs, relati ng to each of the three humors as evidence of an imbalance (and in turn illness).46 Urine analysis is especially crucial as Tibetans believe 43 Jimmy Lama 18/11 44 Drummer pg. 75 45 ibid 46 Saanga 18/11 21it \"is like a mirror that reflect s the feathers of disorder.\"47 One telling characteristic is known as Kuya. Described as \"a cloud within the urin e,\" Dr. Tsepak, a physician at the Sorig clinic tells us that Kuya is like \"a merchant going everywhere in body and last into our urine. It carries message about disease.\"48 Inspection also includes ge neral appearances of the patient such as complexion, posture, attitude, etc., just as a phys ician from any tradition might (although Tibetans place emphasis on appearance of eye-lids and earlobes as well.)49 Palpation refers to diagnosis by touch, or pulse diagnosis; easily the mo st well known aspect of Tibetan medicine, and arguably the most important method of diagnosis. During this process, the doctor 'palpates' the radial artery of each of the patients' wrists. From this artery, the doctor can literally feel and 'read ' the twelve separate pulses emanating from each of our major organs.50 Finally, the interrogative diagnosis process consists of twenty nine distinct questions, each related to disorders/imbalances of a specific humor. The first quest ions revolve around general nature, followed by more specific inquiries aimed at estab lishing more precise information about both patient and disease.51 General Treatment Tibetan treatment is applied (in order) on four levels: 1.) Diet 2.) Behavior 3.) Medicine 4.) 'Surgery' 47 Men-Tsee-Khang pg. 27 Urine analysis is so complex and precise, a fair description w ould require a significant text entirely dedicated to it. An excellent reference can be found in the Journal of Tibetan Medicine, Vol. 3 Nov. 1983 48 Tsepak 25/11 49 Jimmy Lama 18/11 50 Tsepak 25/11 51 Finckh pg. 14 22A change in diet can be extremely sp ecific. The taste, temperature, nature, of every ingredient in ones diet and combinations of those ingredie nts may have a major impact on health.52 Usually, along with a change in diet (or if 1st treatment wasn't successful) a change in behavior is recomm ended. This can be anything from types of clothing to recitation of mantras and other ritual practice, avoidance of 'obstructing impulses' (hunger, excreti on, etc.), daily activities to participate in or avoid, and especially temperatures to monitor. Simply being too hot or too cold may mean the difference between life and death. If neither of these treatments are effective (o r if the doctor administers all three levels after the first diagnosis) medicine may be described. Tibe tan medicines come in various forms, each made according to explicit specifications a nd methods from only natural ingredients. Finally, as a last resort, and only after exhausting all other options, 'surgery ' may be recommended. However, Tibetan surgery is by no means comparable to invasive allopathic surgeries. Their procedures only include moxibustion, Che (acupuncture-like n eedle therapy), \"golden needle\" th erapy, cases blood- letting.53 Finally, Tibetan Medicine cate gorizes each disease according to severity and ability to treat, diseases may be: 1.) Easy to Treat : with proper medicines and cooperation of the patient 2.) Difficult to Treat : long term, multi-faceted therapies may be required, administered by skillful physician 3.) Incurable : physicians administer placebos and support. 4.) Treatment Must Be Withheld : treatment may hasten effects of disease. (See 9 fatal conditions in Appendix 4) For the majority of illnesses, a combination of dietary, behavior, and pharmacological treatments is recommended and may also include massage techniques as well. Tsakar is no exception. 52 Tsepak 20/11 Surgery was banned by the king in the 9th century after a royal patient died during a eye procedure 53 Jimmy Lama 17/11;, Tsepak 25/11; Men-Tsee-Khang pg. 63 23Treating Tsakar When diagnosing Tsakar , a Tibetan physician must determine two major aspect of the disease in a specific patient; its locati on and the out of balance humor, each of which can be determined by detecting very specific symptoms. Recall that Tibetan medicine agrees with the allopathic system in that the origin of the ailment may be far from the symptoms. The Tibetan system takes this in either the torso or limbs as well.54 Again, specific locations can be determined by specific symptoms. For example, while Tsakar causes tremors, limb paralysis, i nvoluntary muscle contraction, etc, Tsakar of the head may cause facial paralysis, insomnia, vo miting, loss of speech or senses and other location specific symptoms. Meanwhile, symptoms arising from Tsakar of the torso are \"speaking too much too quickly,\"55 speaking gibberish, inte nse shivering followed by intense thirst, etc. Similarly, the humoric characteristics of Tsakar can and must be identif ied according to their own specific manifestations. Tsakar is a 'cold disease' arising from a wind imbalance, thus a physician should expect signs of fatigue, intense thirst (drying out due to exce ssive 'wind'), and erratic thought (the \"horse of consciousness\" has been disrup ted), etc.. On some very rare occasions, Tsakar can be due to bile disruptions, where the pa tient develops fever (this form of Tsakar is a 'hot' disease) sever pain, and poor digestion. This form of Tsakar is known as Cho Long Me Pa (very difficult to cure).56 Both location and humoric characteristics may be determined through inspection and interrogation, while a pulse reading can aid the do ctor in determining which specific organs have been affected by the disease and in determining the most effective treatment.57 According to Tibetan medicine, every patient must be treated as a unique , individual case with an equally unique ailment, which requires a 'custom' treatment catered to the specific therapies demanded by the situation. At this point, the course 54 Tsepak 22/11 55 ibid Tibetan medicine sees the stomach as something of a burning fire, and digestion occurs as a result of 'burning food.' When a patient is afflicted with a hot disease, this heat has been disrupted (Tsepak 25/11) 56 Tsepak 25/11 57 ibid 24of treatment is entirely dependent upon the experien ce, style, and skill of the acting physician. Still, there are certain medi cines recommended by rGyud-bZhi and generally accep ted by the medical community as the most likely options, although comb inations, dosages, etc. may vary wildly. With regard to Tsakar medication is the principal form of treatment, followed by message and rest. Medications include: - DschuMar 25* - Adach 8, 15, 17, 20, 35* - Mutik 25 - Samnor* - SamKhyung Krag-Jaksung However, Dr. Ngawang Dhakpa (a.k.a. Jimmy Lama), a physician at the Kunphen clinic in Chhetrapati, Kathmandu is a perfect example of varying approaches to treatment. While most texts and physicians advocate 'surgery' as a last resort, Jimmy Lama c onsiders it, combined with medication, a standard treatment. In his procedure, Jimmy Lama loads a mixture of herbal remedies into a hollow, 24-k golden coil with a sharp needle at one end. He then superheats the tip of the needle, punctures the skin at a very specific point above the spine and injects the herb al mixture. The heat 'activates' wind within the body, which then carries the medicine directly to the nerves. Still this is only one example of treatment; the following specific case s come from Dr. Tsepak's persona l recollection and the records of Dr. Dickyi Yangzom of the Kailash Medical Center, also located in Chhetrapati: Numbers refer to the number of ingredients (each of which may themselves be composed of multiple elements) Spellings of Tibetan medications and Details of those marked by an asterix '*' can be found in the following chapter and/or Appendix 5 Unfortunately, Tibetan medical tradition has nothing in the form of written medical records (a fact to be discussed in further detail later on). The majority of clinics have no case reports from which I could report. Luckily, Dr.'s Tsepak and Yangzom recently began maintaining such records of their patients. While Dr. Tsepak assured me he had such records, he couldn't find them and so could only recount past cases fr om memory. Dr. Yangzom's records, while limited, were well documented and detailed. 25 Dr. Tsepak Case 1: Dr. Tsepak was visiting a village on the Nepa li-Tibetan border. One boy was brought to him with 'fresh' and significant Tsakar in all four limbs, and the face. The boy had lost all bladder control as well (indicating Tsakar of the torso). Dr. Tsepak had only limited supplies of medicine, and could only provide pharmaceutical treatm ent for one week. He then advised the boy's father to massage the boy's entire body with rancid yak butter (aged at least 1-2 years) ev ery day. After one week, the boy's arm tremors subsided considerably to the point where he could hold a cup. After one month the boy could walk without assistance. Since, Dr. Tsep ak has heard the boy made a full recovery Case 2: On man was afflicted so terribly by tremors in his legs that walking was extremely difficult. Dr. Tsepak treated the man with Che (needle therapy). He administered Adach, Samnor, and Mutik medications. After two weeks, the man saw 'noticeable improvement'. 58 Dr. Yangzom Case 1: 22/1/03 56 year old female showing tremors and arth ritis. Difficulty wa lking, can't put right hand behind back without inducing tremor. Allopathic doctor diagnosed her with poor blood pressure, treatment was not suc cessful. Dr. Yangzom prescribed nykil , Dhali 18, and Samnor for ten days. Ten days later, patient returned, showing im provement in the right hand. Dr. Yangzom prescribed LaMing 25, Nykil, and Samkyung, (a.k.a. Dschu-Mar 25 ) for one month. 4/3/03 Patient returned showing overall improvement (and no side effects of medication). Dr. Yangzom prescribed Adach 35, Tiota 18 and LayTeh for 90 days In May, patient returned. Hand was complete ly cured, legs were significantly improved Case 2: 28/1/04 34 year old female, new mother. Complained of feeling very cold during delivery. Also showing back pain, and tremors in both hands. Allopathic doctors determined it was a nerve disorder, but offered no trea tment. Dr. Yangzom diagnosed Tsakar due to rLung imbalance. Kundi, SamKhung, and Adach 35 for ten 8/2/04 Dr. Yangzom prescribed Potuk , PoChung, and KragJaksung for another ten days 9/4/02 Patient returns, significantly improved, but not cured. Dr. Yangzom prescribes Nykil, Samjung, and adach 35. 24/11/02 Patient returns to thank Dr. Yangzom, tremors are completely gone.59 58 Tsepak 25/11 59 Yangzom 27/11 26 Results, without accurate records and as proven by comparing the presented case 'reports', are nearly impossible to quantify, especi ally in any way which might hold up to western scrutiny. Yet, the presented cases, combined with information provi ded from other medical c ontacts, are intriguing nonetheless. As Dr. Yangzom explained (and as confirmed by other sources) treatment of Tsakar may take anywhere from three months to three years, depending on the severity and location of the disease as well as the skill of the physician (only in very rare cases are resu lts as rapid as those recalled the ones Dr. Tsepak). Improvements develop graduall y and diligence on the part of the patient is essential.60 However, despite the slow progress, each doctor claimed a very high success rate for completely curing the ailment and saw no side eff ects whatsoever from treatment (although none could offer any numbers supporting these claims). In the end, it's obvious that the Tibetan treatment of Tsakar , like its allopathic counterpart, is a perfect reflection of the system wh ich developed it. Neither the dis ease nor treatment are isolated in any part of the body, but are viewed as singular asp ects of entire functioning (or dysfunctioning in this case) systems, which then must be evaluated a nd treated accordingly in its entirety. Diagnostic instrumentation and technology is non-existent, medication is pr epared and produced by hand, and lacks any detrimental side effects; yet, detailed reco rds are just as lacking. Thus, any successes are, at this point and according to western views, utterly ' non-conclusive.' This lack of documentation leads to the most controversial aspects of th e Tibetan medical system, its pharmacology. 60 ibid 27Part III Tibetan Medication For years Tibetan pharmaceuticals and the patients and physicians who swear by them have battled with the western scientific community over the safety and valu e of Tibetan medication. Tibetan physicians are eager to practice and administer treatment, but the western world cannot, 'in good conscience,' allow such unproven therapies. Driv en by the scientific met hod (a \"guilty until proven innocent\" mentality), western science refuses to accept anything it hasn't proven multiple times over to be risk-free and effective. The case of Tsakar brings up a perfect example. As mentioned earlier DschuMar 25 (a.k.a. Ranasambe or \"the precious coral pill\") is one of the most popular Tibetan medications for Tsakar , among many other ailments. Yet, one of the main ingredients is Dnul-chu , known in the western world as mercury (Hg). Both in the west and in the east, mercury is regarded as a toxic substance, responsible for causing headaches, vertigo, involunt ary spasms, deafness, behavior change, severe mental disorders, insomnia, symptoms of motor neuron disease and tremors.61 As Tibetans understand these effects of mercury intoxication, it is essent ial that we understand the Tibetan perspective before examination this debate any further. \"Mercury poisoning is responsible for the \"Mad Hatter Syndrome.\" It's basis was the use of mercuric nitrate in the 18th & 19th century by English hat makers to soften the outer stiff hairs of felt. In the old medi cal literature, chronic mercury poisoning in the folks who were \"Mad as a Hatter,\" lead to behavioral changes such as \"accessive embarrassment\", timidity, withdrawal, fatigue, says there is nothing on Eart h that has no medicinal value,\"62 from the most basic elements to the most deadly poisons. This teaching evolved from the belief that all matter on earth, including the \"physique of se ntient creatures\" is composed of the same five basic elements: earth, water, fire, wind, and space; th e qualities of which are responsible for the material aspects of the three humors.63 Tibetan pharmaceuticals are created accordin g to very strict guidelines and specific recipes. Ingredients are broadly classified into three main groups: vegetable products, minerals/metals/precious stones, and animal products.64 Beyond preparing the desired drugs, each ingredient must be prepared, re fined, and purified (in every sense of the word). Faith in these purification procedures (whi ch are indeed 'heavy' on ritual) springs from the tantric roots of Tibetan medicine. Buddhist tantra incorporates the belief that anything can be transformed into something pure or holy, even substances which would otherwise be deadly.65 This tradition maintained a specific fascination with sexual flui ds \"as (generally internalized) power substances.\"66 During its development, another tradition, the alchemists of mediev al India, were also inte rested in sexual fluids which they believed reflected states of metal and discovered the perf ect mineral counterparts for human fluids: sulfur and mica for female and mercury for male.67 The metal's astonishing, almost unworldly chemical properties fascinated scientific and religious thinkers alike, especially its ability to seemingly absorb other substances as if in Ta ntric practice. It was believed merc ury had the ability to \"drive away disease\"68 and lengthen life, but its toxicity demanded recognition as well. Thus , Tantric ritual, along with numerous alchemical techniques, was incorporat ed in order to aid in purifying the precious, but 62 Men-Tsee-Khang pg. 66 63 ibid pg. 67; Dash pg. xx 64 Dash pg. xxiv 65 Lopez 29/10 66 White pg. 5 67 ibid 68 ibid pg. 6 29toxic metal, in theory dispelling all poisons and leaving only the pure element. Today, the mineral is believed to cure a wide range of nervous disorders from nerve damage, to memory loss, even paralysis and infection, but only if properly purified according to painfully meticulous guidelines.69 The rGyud-bZhi provides an eighteen-step purification process aimed at both refining the element and removing any contaminants, and purifying (or 'detoxify') the mercury itself. 70 Each step is revolves around a physical treatment and includes some of the rituals, a nd various Buddhist prayers and mantras associated with purification.71 As this form of \"detoxifi cation\" is as of yet unproven by western standards, it is thereby irrelevant according to western laws; to them, the purified form is just as poisonous and according to Dr. Phillip O'Carroll and prominent Neurosurgeon at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, CA \"The bottom line is all mercury is toxic.\"72 Yet, while Jurgen C. Aschoff, a prominent Tibetan scholar, worked with Tibeta n physicians, he observed that the \"processes unequivocally lead to the elimin ation of impurities trough mechanis tic treatment of the mercury.\"73 Additionally, from chemical perspe ctive, many of the 'purification techniques have the potential to effect the chemical composition of the compound. Interestingly, sulfur, the female essence in the alchemist tradition, is the most signi ficant ingredient in the process. Chemical analysis of 'purified' mercury in pills of DschuMar 25 revealed that most of the metall ic mercury (Hg) had in fact been converted into \"inert and therefore non-toxic Mercuric Sulfide\"74 (HgS) commonly known as cinnabar. However, tests also revealed th at roughly 10-30% (depending on th e medicines source) of the total mercury in each pill remained metallic mercury (around 5gm). 75 The EPA set safe weekly limits of 69 Saanga 19/11 While all 18 steps are recommended, only the first 8 are required, a detailed explanation of which is available in appendix 6. 70 Dash pg. 229 I have chosen not to include any examples of mantras both out of respect for the tradition and beliefs revolving around hard copies of such mantras, and the advice and wishes of my consultants. 71 Tsepak 25/11 72 O'Carroll 8/12 73 Aschoff 74 exposure a maximum of 0.3mg.76 Thus, every 'precious pi ll,' on average, contains roughly 17 times the recommended expos ure levels (pills are often prescribed to be taken 2-3 times a week for months at a time).77 Furthermore, when asked about the converted cinnabar, Dr. O'Carroll admitted \"mercury sulfide, being an inorganic form , is less toxic than elemental mercury\" as it disassociates more slowly in body fluids, but stood by th e fact that \"mercury in all it's forms organic or inorganic ingested or inhaled can cause multi or gan damage... the probability is [simply] less with mercury sulfide as it is one of the least absorbed forms.\"78 However, of the multiple physicians I consulte d, each insisted they have never observed the typical side effects of mercur y intoxication, in any patients treated with mercury-containing medication.79 Although the majority had only their experience to recall, Dr. Yangzom provided detailed records of multiple treatm ents being administered over long periods. At every 'check-up' symptoms were re-evaluated and recorded. After reviewing a numbe r of cases, we found no signs of intoxication. To date, neither the beneficial nor detrimen tal effects of mercury as a healing agent have been scientifically proven (by western standards) , nor are they likely to any time soon. From the Tibetan perspective, animal testi ng would be ridiculous, as medicati on is designed for and applies only to human anatomy.80 In the west, human trials are out of the question, as administering a known toxic substance to patients would be unethical and illegal. The pharmaceutical debate is a perfect reflection of the Tibetan relative lack of scientific method in their approach to health care and the allopathic over- dependence on it. Sadly, neither community admits to any fault in their methods, and thus constitutes the core conflict in this clash of traditions. Although this refers exclusively to inhaled metallic mercury vapor. Dietary restrictions are based on parts per million and refer to methyl mercury, not the' purified' element (because most people don't ingest pure mercury) 76 http://www.epa.gov/mercury/exposure.htm 77 Aschoff; Yangzom Neither of in allopathic medicine 80 Jimmy Lama 18/11 31Part IV Same, Same, But Different: A Brief Comparison of the Tibetan and Allopathic Methods At first glance, one can easily see the stark differences in th e methods in which these two traditions approach Tsakar/ tremors. From concepts of disease to treatments, parallels may be difficult to detect, but the disparities are obvi ous, and it requires an open mind an d careful thought to reveal that but both are at hand and potentially invaluable. Cause While westerners obsess over indivi dual functions at the cellular level, and Tibetans prefer the more holistic approach, both co mmunities reach the same general conclusions: wherever Tsakar /tremors appear, the problem finds its root (u ltimately) in the brai n. Additionally, although Tibetans use the term 'root' quite literally, allopa thics must appreciate the metaphor as well as the astonishingly accurate understanding of the nervous system despite any forms of synthetic diagnostic equipment or any records of formal autopsy.81 Both systems readily acknowledge that the brain controls all functions throughout th e body, and that specific regions of the brai n correspond to each different function. But comparisons don't end with defining the disease. Diagnosis With regards to diagnosis, the Tibetan traditi on is in danger of displaying some reductionist characteristics. When we observe the met hods of diagnosis, both by location and humoric characteristics, it's apparent that Tibetan medicine identifies twelve different forms of the disease, 81 Finckh pg.10 32compared to the ten in allopathic definitions.82 Additionally, any disease may manifest itself in four different forms, what we in the west refer to as a rating of severity, ju st as allopathic physicians use to characterize tremors. Yet, the west believes the dis ease can be isolated and c ontained, while Tibetans attempt to reincorporate an imba lance back into proper synergy, which leads to seemingly stark contrasts in treatment. Treatment Skeptical allopathics are quick to crucify Tibeta n treatments citing lack of conclusive data and clinical trials, while attacking the idea of using poisons in medicine. This turns out to be an interesting approach when we take into consideration the us e of botulinum toxins in treating many diseases, including, more recently, tremors.83 In addition, how many toxic and poisonous materials are used every day in pharmaceutical laboratories, any one of which, if isolated, could be lethal, yet when properly combined form our common and life-sa ving medications. How different are Tibetan purification processes from formulas followed by dr ug manufacturers? Furthe rmore, even in their 'safe,' processed forms, allopathic medicines can be poisons in themselves. Many of the 'side effects' of tremor therapies are identical or worse to symptoms of mercury in toxication. The intention here is neither to vilify one tradition nor co mmend the other but simply to illust rate the fact that differences are inherent, and should be inve stigated, not rejected. Ultimately, it is the combination of these para llel and contrasting elements which will prove most beneficial in the future. 82 Tsepak 22/11 83 Sweeny; http://www.wemove.org/et/et_odt.html 33East Vs. West: Final Conclusions can we deduce from this analysis? What c onclusions and suggestions can we draw? It is clear that each tradition carries wi th it great benefits, as well as re grettable failings; o bvious and subtle alike. First, there is no question as to whether or not Tibetan medi cine is effective. For over 2500 years it has withstood the tests of time, criticism, a nd personal testament. And even if its effects are purely psychological, as some critics claim, effects ar e seen regardless; shouldn't that fact in itself be reason enough to encourage further understanding of the tradition? Still, the world of western science demands documentation. So why don't Tibetan clinic s simply start keeping records? Dr. Jimmy Lama explains that records are unnecessary in Tibetan culture. The effec tiveness or failures of treatments were observed and then shared among peers a nd passed down orally through the generations. Physicians \"shouldn't be prideful [due to of successes] or sad [because of failures]\" as long as they did their utmost to heal.84 Therefore, no reason existed to falsify their experiences. As a result, it is conceivable that record keeping mi ght even take on a negative c onnotation, implying that a physician wanted to prove his skill. Jimmy Lama went on t e xplain that, as every patient is unique and treatment may only be administered on an individual level, each physician is practically required to treat each case differently, and thus records seem of little use.85 However, no one can convincingly argue against the invaluable benefits posed by records and provid ed to everyone from patie nt, to researchers, to physicians alike. It is these record s that have facilitated the rapid e volution of allopathic medicines. The information provided allows us to look back and process and analyz e our decisions. The subsequent knowledge makes it possible to constantly develop new and better means of addressing old dilemmas. Dr. Yangzom, as previously mentioned, is one of the few Tibetan medical practitioners today who maintains accurate records, but the number is growing. She insists such data is vital to accurately trace the effec tiveness of treatment, even citing a time when she used her records to 34convince her peers that Dhali 18 , a medication traditionally used fo r tremors and spasms, showed very positive effect on kidney function.86 Conversely, allopathic medicine has no shortage of failures of its own. Let's contemplate the Tibetan belief in the uniqueness of every patient. Although some in th e west consider it a 'less than scientific approach,' others find it quite refreshing. An editori al in the August 10 1984 New York Times described a growing trend of Americans \"groping for some extra dimension in health care,\" and general dissatisfaction w ith a \"purely scientific approach to healthcare.\" 87 Compared to the Tibetan tradition where \"compassion is the root of cure,\"88 western medicine today falls drastically short in the realm of patient/doctor relationshi ps. House calls and personal physic ians are virtually non-existent today as patients are passed off from specialist to sp ecialist, and treatment is restricted to affordability and the names provided on a list by tight-fisted insu rance companies. Wile western medicine is plagued by bureaucracy, economics, and an obsession with the scientific method; allopathic physicians would do well to remember that even the Hippocratic Oath recognizes spiritua lity and compassion as basic and necessary medical skills. So, what to do? We have at our disposal tw o great, but seemingly opposing healing traditions. With careful analysis, though, it's ap parent that where one fails, the other succeeds. Where Tibetans lack science and speed, allopath ics can provide technology and effi ciency. Where the west lacks compassion and knowledge, Tibetans offer humility and perspective. The two systems compliment each other perfectly. In a field wh ere holistics are left with few opti ons, western trauma care is second to none. And with regards to chronic illness, Tibetan medicine is decades ahead. With an understanding that harsh and invasive \"quick fixes\" are superficial at best, the Tibetan tradition offers persistent and effective cures, rather than a 'chr onic' treatment. But agai n, each has its strengths, 84 Jimmy Lama 18/11 85 ibid 86 Yangzom 27/11 87 Drummer pg. 123 88 Tsepak 20/11 35which leaves us with enormous healing potential. Jimmy Lama put it perfectly when he described the problem of migraines. If he has to work and needs quick relief, he takes an aspirin without question, but knows that won't stop the headaches from returni ng later. On the other hand, Tibetan treatment will end the attacks, but may take days or weeks and are less readily available to most of the world.89 So why not take both? One could administer allo pathic treatment to immediately relieve symptoms (especially debilitating ones as presented by Tsakar /tremors) thereby eliminating, or at least diminishing, the problem and simultaneously begin Tibe tan therapy to slowly degrade the cause. Every Tibetan physician consulted, and even His Holine ss the Dalai Lama, agree such an approach of \"combination therapy\" us in everyone's best interest (although Jimmy Lama recommended administering different treatments at least an hour apart).90 And such treatment is becoming more widely available. The Saychen clinic in Kathmandu, Nepal offers an amalgamation of treatments from Tibetan, Chinese, Nepali, and Indian medical practitioners. With the lo w cost and lack of side effects (accepted in the majority of treatments) it seems ther e is no reason for the allopa thic system to bar the incorporation of Tibetan medical theories and practices. And, hope exists, as Dr. Michael Brant- Zawadzki explains \"while most practicing doctors don't put much va lue on alternative medicine, many acknowledge medicine's effectiveness includes the 'art' of medicine, placebo effects, and that there's less science to what we do than we'd like.\"91 Similarly, due to recent grow ing interests in alternative approaches and scientific backing for others (e.g. acupuncture, meditatio n, etc) some institutions have begun investigating potentially useful methods. Some major universities are even developing programs in alternative or \"integrative\" medi cine. Yet the majority of the we stern world remains skeptical. Dr. Dave Krakow at the CIWEC clinic (an allopathic inst itution) in Kathmandu is slightly reluctant to refer patients to widely available holistic treatments, not because he disapproves, but simply because he is 89 Jimmy Lama 17/11 90 Jimmy effectiveness.92 Western science is still too hesitant to accept that which they can't see and physically demonstrate and define by objective terms. Even the 'mundane' level of Tibetan medicine is endlessly inte rtwined with religious prin cipal, thought, and theory that western science may never recognize. Most allopath ics cling so desperatel y to their foundation in physical mechanics and logic that western science has forgotten what it is to sense the unimaginable, the unexplainable; the very notion that science is born of. Today, wh en such unexplainable events occur such as 'miraculous' healings provided by a hardly unders tood tradition, they aren't considered and investigated, but quickly dismissed as 'impossible' or 'bullshit' simply due to our inability to explain them according to our own comfortable terms and th eories. For now, it seems that the gap between traditional Tibetan medical practice and the modern al lopathic treatment system of medicine may only be bridged when Tibetan medicine can comfort the western worl d by demonstrati ng a little more 'science' in their methods and when the allopathic of the west can summon the courage to have a little more faith. 92 Krakow 37Part VI Methodology My Methods: Over the past month, my research consisted of multiple in-person interviews, as well as interviews conducted over the phone and via email. When I began looking for contact, I had a very difficult time locating any Tibetan physicians who we re interested in speaking with me. Due to the nature of the disease I studied, I started at the gyenso khang (old folks home) asking about which physicians treated patients there. The doctor they referred me to had just left for Switzerland, and wouldn't return until my research period had ended. So, I combed the phone book for clinics, but each call got the same general response (ranging from a gentle 'no' to simply getting hung up on). After calling every Tibetan clinic in Kathmandu, I was about to give up when I decided to just go in person and ask again. To my surprise I was granted an interview on my first try with Dr. Saanga at the Saychen clinic (accidentally m eeting his wife on the way there he lped too). While at first he was skeptical, I think that when he saw my genuine interest in the subject he opened up and became an integral source. Inspired by my success, I walk ed (crutched actually) into the Kailash clinic and had an identical experience with Jimmy Lama. While the phone calls were useless, it taught me the best way to get things done is to do them in pe rson. Unfortunately, I didn't have as much success in getting samples of Dschu-Mar 25 analyzed in a lab. After spending weeks tracking down what seems to be the one lab in Kathmandu equipped to test for mercury, they denied my request (the military hospital isn't too keen on foreign visitors). Luckily I obtained data from an analysis preformed about ten years ago, but having my own, recent lab data would have been much more preferable. 38Suggestions for Future Research: As I said in my methods, my biggest advice, no matter what you're researching, is never take 'no' for an answer (but don't be rude about it), and do wh atever you can to demonstrate your commitment to the subject. As for research t opics, a study focusing on a cer tain aspect of Tibetan medical practice, such as Pulse Reading (Sphyg mology), or Urine anal ysis would be very interesting and I assure you, ther e enough depth and history in these practices to satisfy hundreds of pages of research. Another topic which I wish I could have spent more time on is the different Tibetan medical histories. There are definitely two succinct levels of the history of the practice: a religious history and (somewhat) recorded history. But even recorded medical history is fairly unclear, and looking into the roots of the practice in more detail coul d be very interesting. Finally, don't forget to use every resource available to you, especially local people. Even casual conversations I had with my landlords, shopkeeper s, and friends opened up whole perspectives which I had never considered. 39Works Referenced Electronic 1.

It is present in every normal individual during maintaining a pos ture or movement. Neurologic examination results of patients with physiologic tremor are usually normal. Enhanced Physiologic Tremor This is a high-frequency, low-amplitude, visible tremor that occurs primarily when a specific posture is maintained. Drugs and toxins induce this form of tremor . The suspected mechanism is mechanical activation at the muscular level. Signs and symptoms of drug toxicity or other side effects may or may not be present. Tremor symptoms may improve after discontinuation of the causative agent. Essential Tremor Essential tremor is the most common form of all movement disorders. Classical essential tremor is predominantly a postural- or action-type tremor and usually patient has positive family history of tremor. Drinking alcohol often temporarily reduces the tremor . Other associated symptoms may include mild gait difficulty and, as a group, patients with essential tremor ha ve increase hearing disability compared to controls or patients with Parkinson's Disease. The degree of hearing im pairment seems to correlate with the tremor severity. Parkinson's Tremor This is a low-frequency rest tremor typically defined as a pill-rolling tremor. In some patients, postural and action tremor may also occur. Parkinson's tremor usually occurs in association with other symptoms, such as micrographia, slowness (bradykinesia), and rigidity. Usually, there is no family history of Parkinson's tremor, and alcohol consumption does not decrease movement Cerebellar Tremor Cerebellar tremor is a low-frequency (less than 4 Hz) in tention tremor that usually occurs unilaterally. Common causes are multiple sclerosis, stroke, and cerebellar injury . Signs and symptoms of cerebellar dysfunction may be present, including ataxia, dysmetria, dysdiadokinesia and dysarthria. Holmes' Tremor The term Holmes' or rubral tremor designates a combination of rest, postural, and action tremors due to midbrain lesions in the vicinity of the red nucleus. This type of tremor is irregul ar and slow frequency (4.5 Hz). Signs of ataxia and weakness may be present. Common causes include cerebrovascular accident and multiple sclerosis, with a possible delay of 2 weeks to 2 years in tremor onset and occurrence of lesions. Drug-induced Tremor Types of tremors induced by drugs include enhanced ph ysiologic tremor, rest tremor, and action tremor. Signs and symptoms of drug-induced tremors depend on the dr ug used and on a patient's predisposition to its side effects. Some drugs cause extrapyramidal side effects ma nifesting as bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. It has recently been observed that tremor reappears in Parkin son's patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors reinforcing the observation that anticholingergic agents are very effective in amelurating the tremor of Parkinson's Disease. Tremor Due to Systemic Disease Tremor due to systemic disease usually occurs when the patient is moving or assumes a specific position. Associated symptoms include asterixis, mental status ch anges, and other signs of systemic illness. Diseases such as thyrotoxicosis and hepatic failure as well as deliriu m tremens and drug withdrawal are among the common causes. 46Psychogenic Tremor Psychogenic tremor may involve any part of the body, but it most commonly affects the extremities. Usually, tremor onset is sudden and begins with an unusual combination of postu ral, action, and resting tremors. Psychogenic tremor decreases with distraction and is asso ciated with multiple other psychosomatic complaints. Orthostatic Tremor Orthostatic tremor is considered to be a variant of essential tremor. This type of tremor occurs in the legs immediately on standing and is relieve d by sitting down. Orthostatic tremor is usually high frequency (14 Hz to 18 Hz), and no other clinical signs and symptoms are present. Manifestations: Rest or Resting Tremor Resting tremor occurs when a body part is at comple te rest against gravity. Tremor amplitude decreases with voluntary activity. Postural Tremor Postural tremor occurs during maintenance of a position against gravity and increases with action. Action or Kinetic Tremor This form of tremor occurs during voluntary movement Task-specific Tremor This tremor emerges during specific activity. An example of this type is primary writing tremor. Intention or Terminal Tremor Intention tremor manifests as a marked increase in tremor amplitude during a terminal portion of targeted movement. Examples of intention tremor include cerebellar tremor and multiple sclerosis tremor. General Cases Definite essential tremor: Postural tremor in the arms which increases during action in the absence of any condition or drug known to cause enhanced physiological tremor and in the absence of cerebellar symptoms and signs, and in the absence of PD and dystonia. Head tremor may or may not be present. Probable essential tremor: Postural tremor in the arms without increase during action in the absence of any condition or drug known to cause enhanced physiological tremor and in the absence of cerebellar symptoms and signs, and in the absence of PD and dystonia. Vocal and h ead or neck tremor in the absence of any condition or drug known to cause enhanced physiological tremor and in the absence of cerebellar symptoms and signs, and in the absence of PD and dystonia. Possible essential tremor: Postural tremor in the arms and action tr emor in arms in the absence of any condition or drug known to cause enhanced physiological tremor a nd in the absence of cerebellar symptoms and signs, but in the presence of PD and dystonia.93 93 Sweeney 47Appendix 3: Western Drugs Used in Tremor Therapy First-line drug therapies for the treatment of ET include... -Propranolol (Inderal\u00ae) : The response of ET symptoms to treatment with the beta-block er propranolol is highly variable. Beta-adrenergic blockers are a class of drugs that inhibit response to adrenergic stimulation by blocking -adrenergic receptors in heart muscle and other smooth muscle. Blockage of this stimulation effectively resu lts in a decrease in in heart ra te and cardiac output as well as a reduction in blood pressure. Approximately 50% to 70% of patients obtain some symptomatic relief. However, only in rare cases is the tremor totally suppressed. Beta-adrenergic blockage helps to control the involuntary, rhythmic movements of ET. Tremor amplitude is usually decreased; however, the frequency of tremor usually remains unaffected. The average reduction in tremor is about 50% to 60%. As the severity of the tremor lessens, functional disability also diminishes. However, some individuals will not respond to propranolol an d the drug is often not well tolerated in older individuals. The typical beginning oral dosage of propranolol is 40mg twice a day. The dosage may be gradually increased as needed to 120-320 mg/day in 2 to 3 divided doses. Propranolol and other beta-blockers may not be appropriate for patients with asthma, certain heart problems (e.g., advanced AV block, severe bradycardia, congestive heart failure, etc.), poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, pulmonary disease, or peripheral vascular disease (e.g., Raynaud's or Buerger's disease). Possible side effects of propranolol therapy include dizziness, fatigue, depression, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, changes in blood sugar levels, or sexual difficulties. Other more serious si de effects (particularly in susceptible patients with other preexisting medical conditions) may include difficulty breathing, sinus bradycardia, and hypotension. Patients should not abruptly discontinue their treatment with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent such as propranolol. Physicians typically work with patients to establish a schedule of a gradual reduction in dosage. In this way, patients are slowly weaned from the medication. Beca use propranolol may interact with certain other drugs (e.g., anti-hyperglycemic and antihypertensive agents, barbiturates, NS AIDS, etc.), it is also important that the treating physician review the patient's current and recent past drug regimen. -Primidone (Mysoline\u00ae) : Primidone, an anticonvulsant medication related to phenobarbital, slows the central nervous system and helps to reduce or control seizure activity in certain types of epilepsy. In addition, primidone is cons idered a first-line th erapy for the treatm ent of patients with essential tremor. The starting dosage for primidone is low (e.g., 25 mg) and raised very slowly as needed. Two formulations of primidone are avialable; namely, 50mg and 250mg. Most clinicians recommend that patients start with half of a fifty tablet of primidone. The maximum dosage is 750 mg/day in three divided doses. However, 150 mg to 300 mg, in a single or divided doses appears to be an effective dose that may work as well as higher doses. Six studies have been conducted to determine the rate of response to primidone. These studies reported varied rates ranging from a 60% to a 100% response. However, some patients will not respond to primidone therapy. One report estimated that about 71% of patients respond po sitively to primidone. Patients should not ab ruptly discontinue therapy with primidone. After consultation with a physician, the dosage is reduced gradually. When treatment with primidone is initiated, some patients expe rience an acute idiosyncratic toxic response to the drug. Symptoms of this type of reaction may include nausea, vomiti ng, fatigue or sleepiness, confusion, and ataxia. This initial toxicity may occur in as many as 20% of patients. These symptoms typically resolve in one or two days. Additional possible side effects of prim idone include vertigo, unsteadiness, irr itability, blurred vision, loss of appetite, or decreased sexual function. Primidone should be taken with meals to help minimize gastrointestinal (GI) effects such as indigestion and GI irritation. These side effects are typically short-lived and disapp ear with continued therapy. Side effects of chronic therapy are usually minimal and infrequent. Drug Tolerance : Some patients may develop a tolerance for propranolol and prim idone over time, although no controlled studies have been conducted to support this view. However, propranolol and primidone are effective long-term therapy for some patients with ET. Acute adverse reactions to initiation of primidone therapy and side effects with chronic use of propranolol may hinder continued therapy in some patients. 48Combination drug therapies : Primidone and propranolol may be used in combination if they have not sufficiently reduced symptoms when used alone. In such cases, primidone is usually prescribed at 25mg at bedtime. The dosage is then increased gradually to 250 mg/day. Propranolol is then added to the drug regimen, usually at 40 mg three times per day. Propranolol dosage may be increased to a maximum of 320 mg/day if the response remains inadequate. Alternatively, a long-acting formulation of propranolol may be substituted if once-daily administration is desired. One study reported that the combination of propranolol and primidone was more effective in treating the symptoms of ET than the individual use of either drug. 94 Other Drug Therapies Second-line drug therapies for the treatme nt of ET include benzodiazepines, a class of drugs that interferes with chemical activity in the nervous system and brain, serving to reduce communication between nerve cells and to a \"slowing down\" the central nervous system. Such medications promote sleep, relieve anxiety, reduce restlessness, and relax muscles. Examples of benzodiazepines that have been used to treat patients with ET include clonazepam -adrenergic receptor antagonist that is similar to propranolol. It may be an effective treatment for individuals with ET who were previously responsive to propranolol. Methazolamide (Neptazane\u00ae) has been studied and seems to have limited usefulness in the treatment of essential head and voice tremor. Side effects may include drowsiness, nausea, stom ach discomfort, paresthesias, or loss of appetite. The drug gabapentin (Neurontin\u00ae) has also been studied in a double blin d, controlled trail for its effec tiveness in the treatment of ET. The results suggested that, as an adjuvant therapy, gabapentin has limited benefit in patients with ET. Topiramate (Topamax\u00ae). According to the results of a randomized clinical, topiramate (Topamax from OrthoMcNeil) effectively reduces tremor. Tw enty-four patients with ET received either pl acebo (no drug) or topiramate. The dose was gradually increased to 400 mg/day over at least 8 weeks. This was followed by a 2-week period without drug or placebo and then reassignment to the other arm of the study. Fifteen patients completed th e trial; six patients withdrew while on topiramate (two for dizziness or disorientation) and three patients withdrew while on placebo (one for failure to take the placebo as directed one for memory problems and ataxia). In the 15 patients who completed th e study, the mean final dose was 333 mg/day. Topiramate treatment improved tremor scores by approximately 25%; placebo improvement was approximately 1%. Improvements remained significant for all scores except functional disability (p=.06). Selected patients with ET who do not respond to drug therapy may receive local inj ections of botulinum toxin (BTX) type A (Botox\u00ae). Some improvement in symptoms has been noted. Chemodenervation with BTX may significantly ameliorate essential hand tremor in patients who fail to improve with conventional pharmacologic therapy. A small, randomized study compared th e relative effectiveness of propranolol or gabapentin (Neurontin\u00ae) against a placebo. Treatment with propranol ol or gabapentin yiel ded improvement in symptoms as m easured by the Tremor Clinical Rating Scale (TCRS including clinical examination, motor task performan ce, ADLs, and subjective assessment), accelerometry, and a patient-reported disability scale. The results suggest that ga bapentin may have a role in the treatment of ET; however, more studies are needed to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of gabapentin for the treatment of individuals with ET. 95 94 http://www.wemove.org/et/et_pt.html 95 http://www.wemove.org/et/et_odt.html 49Appendix 4: Tibetan Medical Theories, Structure, and more -The 9 Fatal Conditions: \"The nine fatal conditions (incurable illnesses wh ich lead to biological dissolution death are: 1.
