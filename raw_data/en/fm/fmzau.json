Documentation The purpose of this standard is to stipulate procedures and toler ances in inspection that is performed at installation of electronic balances or inspection that is performed periodically. 2. Scope This standard shall apply to ins pection of electronic balances pe rformed by service engineers at Shimadzu's overseas sales companies or dist ributors. Note, however that this standard is a recommended standard laid down by the Weighi ng Instrument Group, Quality Assurance Department, Analytical & Measur ing Instruments Division, Shimadz u Corporation. If the party requesting the inspecti on specifies different standards, t hey shall be given preference. This standard shall not apply to inspection of Ty pe Approval Models laid down in OIML R76. 3.

Classification and Inspection Tolerances 1) Before inspecting electronic balances, deter mine the classification of instruments and the inspection tolerances (maxim um permissible errors). 2) Determine the classification by the mini mum number of display digits d and weighing capacity of the electronic balance, and set the inspection toleranc es according to the determined classification. To be more specific, this shall be in accordance with Tables 1 and 2. 3) For dual-range electronic balanc es (multiple range instrument s), set the classification and inspection tolerances for each range. 4) For electronic balances having an extended or auxiliary indi cating device, the display on the extended indicating device or auxiliary indicating device shall be regarded as minimum number of display digits d.

External Appearance and Functions There shall be no abnormalities in the extern al appearance and functions of the following and otherwise: 1) LCD Display 2) Level Gauge 3) Level Adjuster 4) TARE function 6-2. Performance 6-2-1. Repeatability (Ins pection is performed for both the small and large ranges in the case of dual-range electronic balances.) 1) In the case of models with built-in cali bration weights, calibration shall be performed using those built-in weights. 2) Repeat placing and removing a single wei ght (up to two weights if necessary) close to 1/2 or above the weighing capacity at least five times, and record the measurement values at the zero point and when the load is placed. Instead of recording the measurement val ues of the zero point, the load may be placed after setting the display to zero eac h time and only the measurement values when the load is placed may be recorded. 3) Calculate the width (maximum value - mi nimum value) for each of the zero point values and values when the load is placed (when the zero point is not measured in step 2) above, only the value when the load is placed). T hose values shall be taken as \"Passed\" if they fall within the inspection tolerances. 6-2-2. Eccentric Error (Only the large range shall be inspected in the case of dual-range electronic balances.) 1) Place a single weight close to between 1/3 to 1/2 of the weighing capacity in order at the following positions, and record the measurement values. Center, front left, front right, back righ t, back left, center (See figures below.) The \"center\" refers to the cent er of the dish, and other positi ons refer to the center of each area after dividing the top surfac e of the dish into four areas. For example, in the case of a round dish, pl ace the weight at posit ions half the radius away from the center of the circle. 2) If the differences (called the \"eccentric error\") between t he average value of the two values when the weight is pl aced in the center and the val ues at positions other than the center are all within t he inspection tolerances, then t hose values shall be taken as \"Passed.\" The difference with the first center value, not the average value of the two values when the weight is placed in the center, may be taken to be the corner load error. ZF4M-0015 (4/5) SHIMADZU CORPORATION 6-2-3. Linearity (Inspection is performed for both the small and large ranges in the case of dual-range electronic balances.) 1) Set four or more observation points including close to the weighing capacity. Set the observation points referring to the following: A) Points that divide the weighing range equally, or their vicinity B) Point where inspection tolerance changes C) Load region of special interest to the party reques ting the inspection 2) Place weights corresponding to the set obs ervation points in the following order, and record the measurement val ues. Instead of recording the measurement value of the zero point, the load may be placed after se tting the display to zero each time and only the measurement values when the lo ad is placed may be recorded. Zero point No. 1 (smallest) observation point No. 2 observation point No. 3 observation point x x x x Largest observation point (near weighing capacity) Zero point 3) Subtract the average value of the first and last \"zero poi nts\" from the measurement value of each observation point. (This is not required when the zero points are not measured in step 2) above.) 4) Obtain the differences (called \"linearit y\") between each of the values calculated in step 3) above and the conventional mass of t he placed weights. T hose values shall be taken as \"Passed\" if they fall wi thin the \u00b1 inspection tolerances. 7.
