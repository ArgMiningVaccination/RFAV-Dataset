The child may die if it fails to kill bacteria. Please share your comments. Thanks, Jagan --By Jagadheeswaran", "sitename": null, "date": null, "cleaned_text": "Vaccines are dangerous, Are vaccines necessary? If the bacteria are killed or half killed they have lost their virulence to cause the disease each of it can cause; and the immunity develops against the diseases that each bacteria can cause, only when the supposed bacteria are alive and active. This is common sense; but the allopathy bereft of this sense, indulges in vaccines impudently. The dead or killed bacteria having no activity is only circulating in the blood stream with its deadly anatomical particles getting lodged in various tissues of the organs of the human system as foreign bodies or as toxic materials; and since the deadly particles of the bacteria are not biologically viable to the bodily system, they will not be digested or will ever be metabolised or eliminated by the kidneys or through the skin or through the lungs or through the liver. Yet through all these means the body will try to eliminate the deadly particles of the killed bacteria contained in the vaccines with their inherent toxicity. The dangerous situation arises here for the children who receive such killed bacteria as vaccines. In all of these organs of elimination such as kidneys, liver, lungs and skin and the muscles, the toxic substances of the bacteria gets lodged and mix up with the cellular organelles and their genes and converts the cells as antigenic cellular material. This is the starting point of immunity against the original tissues of these organs; from this point develops auto immune diseases such as: muscular dystrophy, kidney failure, liver failure, lung failure and so on until the children become dead.
