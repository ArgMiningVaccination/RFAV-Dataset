Our trend-setting circumnavigator ticks off big nautical miles yet remains small enough to easily maintain and operate short-handed. With her heavily carbon reinforced structures and total epoxy construction she sails like a racer yet remains amazingly easy to operate and maintain. The ultra high-performance voyager was designed for sailors with speed in their hearts but luxury on their minds. Our long-distance, off-the-grid, expeditionary speedster was uniquely designed to carry significant cruising payloads without bogging down. Our stunning new flagship is a ground-breaking super-high-performance luxury adventurer that sports both a forward cockpit and dual bulkhead helms. Like many insurgent brands, Balance was born from our frustration. The catamaran market had simply become dominated by charter cats or racing cats, leaving few options for those seeking something in-between. We took our collective experience born from thousands of miles at sea to design and create truly balanced, handcrafted performance catamarans that would offer our customers years of blissful living and sailing. We are world-class sailors who saw a need for catamarans that merge open-water performance and modern livability. We were born out of listening to sailors and continue to grow and innovate by being a part of the Balance community. \"On the water, Balance Catamarans achieve the elusive combination of excellent performance in a broad range of wind and sea conditions, on most points of sail, with good payload-carrying ability.\" \"Truly impressive...With the scaled-down 442, Balance fills out the family offering with dimensions and a price point that make their designs more accessible to a broader swath of the cruising market.

Access for repairs is exceptional. The movement from helm to side decks and from side decks to foredecks is a breeze. The wiring and systems installations all reflect a commitment to functional excellence.\" \"Several Balance 526 owners have reported 24-hour periods covering 260 miles or more. This is one very, very fast catamaran, laden "}
