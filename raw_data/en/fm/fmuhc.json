It is non-pathogenic and immunogenic, which can replace the initial infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to obtain specificity after vaccination. The immune system can be used to prevent tuberculosis. 1 species BCG vaccine for intradermal injection can be divided into two dosage forms: liquid and freeze-dried. Because the liquid BCG vaccine has a short validity period, unstable quality, and difficult to store, it is rarely used now. At present, freeze-dried BCG vaccines are mainly used in China. 2 Vaccination target Because of the passive immunity without fetal transmission of tuberculosis, newborns are susceptible after birth. Therefore, the current immunization procedures stipulate that newborns should be vaccinated 24 hours after birth. Urban children should be immunized once at the age of 7 and rural children should be immunized once at 7 and 12 years old. 3 How to use Because the intradermal annotation method for BCG vaccination has the advantages of accurate injection dose and high tuberculin test positive conversion rate, this method is currently used for vaccination. The specific method is: dilute the freeze-dried BCG vaccine with the diluent, shake it well, and inject 0.1 ml intracutaneously into the middle of the deltoid muscle on the outer side of the upper arm. 4 Immune effect BCG has been used for more than 80 years since its inception. A large number of observations at home and abroad have confirmed that its immune effect is affirmative, and it can reduce the incidence, prevalence, mortality and incidence of tuberculous meningitis under 15 years of age. Both played an important role. The immune effect of BCG vaccine can be affected by many factors such as vaccine titer, vaccination technique, and local atypical mycobacterial infection. In recent years, due to the development of planned immunization work and the continuous improvement of the cold chain system in my country, the positive conversion rate of tuberculin test 12 weeks after the initial planting has generally increased, generally above 95%, and the average diameter of local blush is above 5.0mm. The protection rate of nursery is above 95%, and it can be protected for about 5-10 years. 5 Vaccination reaction Local redness, swelling and induration appear 2-3 weeks after intradermal inoculation of the BCG vaccine, generally with an average diameter of about 10mm, and then gradually soften in the middle to form small abscesses that can be absorbed or pierced into ulcers, with a diameter of about 3-5mm, 8-12 After weeks of spontaneous scab fall off, there is a concave scar. The whole process lasts about 2-3 months. A few people may cause swelling of the lymph nodes in the armpit or supraclavicular side of the inoculation side, but it does not exceed 10mm. The above are general reactions. Occasionally, a small number of children have severe reactions, with large and deep local ulcers, or cause lymph nodes to become purulent, and the scabs cannot heal for several months. Very few people may have keloids and other reactions. 6 Contraindications People with immune insufficiency of tuberculosis should not be vaccinated; fever, acute disease, liver, kidney, heart, and skin diseases should be vaccinated; premature babies, dystocia and those with a history of allergies should be cautiously vaccinated. 7 matters needing attention 7.1 The storage of BCG vaccine should be handled by a dedicated person, and it cannot be mixed with other vaccines and drugs. The product name, batch number and expiration date should be checked before use. If there is no label, the expiration date, broken ampoule, or unshakable pellets should be discarded. 7.2 The syringe and needle of the BCG vaccine should be dedicated. The dose of intradermal inoculation should be accurate and the injection should not be too deep. 7.3 When diluting the freeze-dried BCG vaccine, care should be taken to completely dissolve it. It should be shaken well during use, and should also be shaken well at any time after inhaling the syringe. 8 Transportation and storage The BCG vaccine should be transported and stored in a medical refrigerator at 2-8\u00b0C. Even the freeze-dried BCG vaccine should not be stored "}
