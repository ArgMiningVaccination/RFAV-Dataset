One of our staffers came to my office and told me: \"You have to stop inventing new products; we don't have any more room for them on the price sheet.\" And then: \"We know that you have a soft spot in your heart for those... those nontoxic cleaners. But, no one else cares!\" I laughed and bought a bigger price sheet. We kept making those nontoxic cleaners and in 2003 created the first USDA [non-toxic cleaning product formulated specially for Yoga Mats](https://shop.vermontsoap.com/product-category/yoga/yoga-mat-cleaner/). Other sprays and organic cleaners followed, many with USDA organic certification from VOF. Natural cleaners are now a multi-million dollar business, and Vermont Soap still makes the cleanest, most natural ones of all.
