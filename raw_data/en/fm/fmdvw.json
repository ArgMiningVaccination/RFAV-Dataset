Your immune system health has a lot to do with the way you feel overall, so it's important to keep it humming to reduce your reaction to these pesky irritants. While genetics can play a role in the way your immune system functions, there are certain things you can do to keep it healthy and happy, such as [naturopathy](/naturopathy). Read on for more information on immune system health and how to identify how yours currently stacks up. Gut health and your immune system health We know that [gut health](/gut-health) is super important when it comes to many areas of your overall health, and your immune system health is no different. In fact, 70% of your immune system is located in and around your gut and the bacteria that live in your gut play a big part in how well your immune system performs. So, if your gut isn't too happy it's safe to say your immune system won't be too chuffed either!

How do I know if my immune system is happy or unhappy? That pesky sniffle, tummy bug or the flu are the most common ways to know that your immune system health is being challenged, and these short term symptoms are the most common response of a well functioning, happy immune system. There are two main ways that your immune system becomes unhappy and your immune system health becomes affected; it becomes under responsive and that common cold takes weeks to clear, or you may feel vaguely unwell for longer periods of time. Your immune system is over responsive when your body typically overreacts or has an allergic reaction to certain stimulants such as pollen (hello, hay fever), or commonly in the case of autoimmunity or other diseases, such as: Rheumatoid arthritis Multiple sclerosis Crohns disease Cancer Coeliac disease Parkinsons disease Allergies Asthma Eczema Psoriasis Hashimotos disease Influenza Graves disease SLE (lupus) Sjogrens syndrome Kidney/Bladder infections Recurrent rhinitis/hayfever Ankylosing spondylitis Bronchitis Candidiasis Ear infection Common cold Chat to us about how our services can assist you to get your immune system health in tip top "}
