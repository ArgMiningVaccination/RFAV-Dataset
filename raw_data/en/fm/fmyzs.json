Dates: TBD Known as the \"Gold-Standard\" for learning mindfulness meditation for stress reduction and wellness, MBSR is a 9-week 27.5 hour training developed by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts's Medical Center in 1979. It has been featured in countless media segments, hundreds of research studies and is now offered all over the world in hospitals, schools, business and sports. And here at Avalon for the past 10 years! Intended for those who are motivated to be more active in their own well-being and health, this program provides intensive, supportive experiential training to guide you in that direction. Cheryl Kurash, Ph.D., a certified MBSR and yoga teacher and licensed psychologist, has been studying, practicing and teaching meditation for the past 30 years. Her interest in the ways these disciplines intersect, diverge and inform each other deepens her understanding of mind-body integration and guides her teachings. Cheryl completed MBSR Teacher Training and received certification with the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at UMASS Medical School, under the auspices of Jon Kabat-Zinn. Her study of contemplative practices includes Tibetan Buddhist (Shambhala) meditation, Vipassana (Insight) meditation, and Yoga - her love of which led to Teacher Training in Kripalu Yoga. A highlight of her study was a journey in 1987 with the Himalayan Institute for Yoga Science and Philosophy to Gangotri and Gomuk, India, the source of the Ganges River. "}
