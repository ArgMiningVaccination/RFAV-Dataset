S., the last five decades constituted a unique era. American children received more vaccines than any previous generation, and laws requiring their immunization agains t a litany of diseases became common. Vaccination rates soared, preventable infec tions plummeted, and popular acceptance of vaccines remained strong\u2014even as an increas ingly vocal cross-section of Americans questioned the safety and necessity of vaccine s and the wisdom of related policies. This dissertation examines how and why, betw een the 1960s and 2000s, Americans came to accept the state-mandated vaccination of all children against a growing number of infections despite the growing prominence of vaccine doubts. I argue that vaccines and vaccine policies fundamentally changed th e ways health experts and lay Americans perceived the diseases they were designed to prevent. Second, I demonstrate that vaccination policies and their acceptance throughout this period were as contingent on political, social, and cultural concerns as th ey were on scientific findings. Thirdly, I show how, as new vaccine policies took shape, fe minism, environmentalism, and other social movements laid challenge to scientific and governmental authority, with profound\u2014but previously overlooked\u2014implications for how Americans perceived vaccination. Finally, I argue that the relationship between vaccina tion beliefs and political ideology is more complex than historians have heretofore a sserted, for selective a nd blanket vaccination doubts at the end of the twentieth century we re as informed by leftist critiques of v capitalism and social hegemonies as by traditio nal American libertarian ethics. This work draws on a diverse set of sources, including presidential ar chives; government agency records and publications; popular and scientific print medi a; television broadcasts; newsletters; archives; documents a nd publications chiropr actic libraries; and the personal files of vacc ine scientists and critics. It contri butes to the histories of disease, women, the environment, and health politic s, as well as the sociology of social movements. By placing public health knowledge in historical contex t, this dissertation illuminates the many meanings of vaccination that lay between that of gold-standard disease preventive and hotly contested enterpri se at the end of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first. vi Table of Contents Introduction 1 Chapter 1 When is One Case Too Many?

The diagnosis prompted the Hansens to conduct their own re search into autism treatments and theories of causation. In the process, they learned th at thimerosal, a mercur y-based preservative, had been present in the vaccines their child ren had received. Thimerosal was removed from vaccines beginning in 1999, and countless studies and scientific reviews failed to turn up evidence of a link between thimerosal and autism. But that didn't matter to Jared Hansen, a former research chemist who said he was \"incensed\" when he learned that thimerosal had been in his children's vacci nes, because he recalle d treating mercury as carefully as radioactive materials when he was a student. Their faith in official recommendations shaken, the Hansens d ecided to conduct thei r own risk-benefit calculations on the recommended vaccines for th eir children. They concluded that shots against hepatitis B, flu, chicken pox, and pne umococcus weren't worth getting, since in their assessment the infections either posed lit tle risk to children or were rarely deadly. But they continued to vaccinate their child ren against other inf ections, including polio, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, measles, rubella, and mumps. 1 The author of the article in the Globe , pediatric cardiologist Darshak Sanghavi, condemned the Hansens for committing \"an ancient error\" by concluding, based on personal experience, that the mercury in v accines could have caused their children's 1 Darshak Sanghavi, \"The Secret Truth,\" The Boston Globe Magazine , December 4, 2005, 42. 2 autism. Sanghavi called the Hansens loving, devo ted parents, but then accused them of failing to be \"truly scientific and objective. \" Their case convinced Sanghavi that policies making vaccines mandatory for children were wise, since \"sometimes, personal freedom can be a dangerous thing.\" 2 In a follow-up letter to the ed itor, Jared Hansen asked that \"parents like us\" not be summarily dismi ssed as \"unreasonable\" and \"dangerous,\" and listed his own demands of the medical professi on: \"Your patients are not 'the herd,' but individuals. When doctors stop asking 'Has this child been vaccinated?' and begin asking 'Should this child be vaccinated?' they will ag ain be healers we can trust with the health of our children.\"3 The dispute between Sanghavi and the Ha nsens was emblematic of the polarized debate over vaccination that wa s increasingly featured on talk shows, magazine covers, and headlines in both the popular and scientific press in the first decade of the twenty- first century. Much as it was popular fodder for the media, this debate also drew scrutiny from both scientists and scholars of the medical humanities.4 But all of this attention has come at the expense of a more nuanced unders tanding of the myriad factors influencing Americans' attitudes toward vaccines and v accine policies. While polarized, the debate over vaccines is not easily defined as one that pits pro-vaccine forces against anti- vaccinators. As the Hansens' story shows, a ttitudes and beliefs toward vaccination in 2 Ibid. 3 Jared Hansen, \"Letters: Vaccines and Autism,\" The Boston Globe Magazine , January 1, 2006, 6. 4 Sanghavi's own article is an illustration of this trend.

More importantly, however, this debate is only one small piece of the larger story of vaccines and American culture, politics, and society at the end of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first. It is this larger story, with all of its complexities and nuances, that this dissertation analyzes , by examining the myriad factors shaping vaccination policies and reception from the 1960s to the early 2000s. This work is driven by two overarching research ques tions: First, how and why di d the universal vaccination of children against a list of diseases ranging in severity become such a widely accepted political, social, and cultural norm in this pe riod? And second, what forces gave rise and shape to the vaccine doubts whose pervasiven ess gradually increased in this period? A New Era of Vaccination This dissertation focuses on the social hist ory of vaccination in the U.S. from the 1960s to the early 2000s because, as I argue in the opening chapters, these five decades constituted a unique era in the more than two centuries of vaccination in the U.S. During this time period, the federal government assumed, for the first time, a prominent and authoritative role in the area of vaccination policy and practice. As their authority was consolidated, federal health o fficials began a push for univers al vaccination against what they called the \"milder\" diseases, including m easles, mumps, and rubella\u2014which (in the 1960s at least) were viewed as less severe than polio, smallpox, and diphtheria, the previous targets of mass vaccination cam paigns. This push was accomplished largely 4 through the vaccination of children, even when this meant vaccinating children against infections that posed a greater threat to other members of th e population (as rubella did to pregnant women, or mumps did to adolescen t males and grown men). To a significant extent, the mass vaccination of children was realized through the adoption and strengthening of a patchwork of laws at the state level, which made vaccines mandatory for school enrollment.5 The ease with which such laws were adopt ed in the 1970s created a new norm for vaccination policies in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s , when laws requiring the vaccination of children for school enrollment (or day care) became the de facto policy approach for many new vaccines. Since the 1960s, vaccine s have been recommended by a federal committee, the Centers for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which drafts the nation's recomm ended immunization schedules. The ACIP's guidelines are not enforceable rules, but th ey are generally used as the basis for legislative acts or regulations that make vaccinations mandatory at the state or local level for children. State laws a nd regulations requi ring children's immuni zation against the litany of targeted diseases\u2014hepatitis B, ro tavirus, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus flu, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chicken pox)\u2014are now common. As a result, American children today receive more vaccines and vaccine dos es than any previous generation. Between 5 These laws are typically referred to as vaccine \"mandates,\" even though exemptions exist for each required vaccine. In all states, children may be exem pted from required vaccines for medical reasons; in most states (save Mississippi and West Virginia) they may be exempted for religious reasons. Eighteen states also permit \"personal\" or \"p hilosophical\" exemptions. See National Conference of State Legislatures, \"States with Religious and Philosophical Exemptions from School Immunization Requirements,\" March 2011. Available at http://www .ncsl.org/default.aspx?tab id=14376, accessed May 2011. 5 birth and age six, children currently typically receive at least 32 recommended vaccinations, which protect them agains t at least 13 different infections.6 Over the last four decades, different federal administra tions have supported the cause of childhood vaccination to varying extents, but on th e whole from the 1960s to the early 2000s, vaccination rates soared, preventable infec tions plummeted, and popular acceptance of vaccines held strong. At the same time, an increasingly vocal cross-section of Americans questioned the safety and necessity of vaccines and the wis dom of related policies. The current reality, then, is this: national imm unization rates are unprecedentedl y high, but vaccine skeptics and detractors\u2014like the Hansens\u2014continue to grab headlines and bear much of the blame for preventable disease outbreaks. Scie ntific studies investigating the reasons behind vaccination status tend to turn up proximal explana tions for parental choices\u2014 parents who vaccinate their children trust their doctors, fear the preventable diseases, and want the best care for their kids, while parents who don't get a ll of the recommended vaccines for their children either lack acce ss to the health care system; distrust the medical profession, government officials, and pharmaceutical companies; or subscribe to 6 The Centers for Disease Control recommends that all children receive vaccines against hepatitis B, rotavirus, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus Influenza type b (Hib), pneumococcus, polio, flu, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chicken pox ). Some of these are ad ministered as combined vaccines; all of the recommended vaccines (combined or not) are administered in multiple doses, usually totaling between 2 and 4 doses. Children with certain ri sk factors are also advised to be vaccinated against hepatitis A and meningococcus.

But th ere are far more distal reasons that shape these responses, and they vary by di sease and vaccine and over time. Identifying and resolving these reasons requires asking a much broader set of questions about the very natu re of our vaccine policies and attitudes and how they came to be. What forces lent shape to our curre nt policy approach and its various iterations? Further, what do our vaccination policies a nd popular responses to them reveal about American values and cultural and political preoccupations? Why, for instance, did some parents question the chicken pox vaccine, whil e accepting vaccines against similarly mild (or even milder) infections, such as mump s or rubella? How and why, for instance, did health officials recommend and American pare nts come to accept the vaccination of their children against hepatitis B, when this infec tion is categorically different from smallpox and polio in its severity and its threat to ch ildren? As this disserta tion shows, parents and society at large are not always willing to accept the mandated vaccination of children against every preventable disease, no matte r how serious or widespread. Rather, the deployment and acceptance of these vaccines and others was shaped in each case by its social, cultural, political, and sc ientific historical moment. Four key themes guide this dissertati on's inquiry into the socio-cultural underpinnings of American vaccination polic ies and attitudes from the 1960s through the 2000s. The first is the state' s interest in disease prev ention through vaccination. The pursuit of public health\u2014speci fically, the prevention and management of epidemics\u2014has long served the economic and political intere sts of the state, broadly construed, as 7 historians Dorothy Porter, Elizab eth Fee, and others have shown.7 Disease prevention (and in the case of smallpox, eradication) through vaccination has been hailed as a crowning achievement of twentie th-century public health. But in the century and a half leading up to the mid-twentieth century, however, vaccinatio n was on the whole a local, reactive affair; cities, municipalities, and states primarily promoted vaccination as a means of protecting local populations ag ainst impending epidemics. The federal government assumed an authoritative role in regulating vaccines in 1902, when Congress approved the Biologics Control Act. But Wash ington largely avoided telling states which members of the population should be vacci nated against which diseases until mid- century, when popular agitation over access to the polio vaccine drove the Eisenhower administration to adopt federal vaccination le gislation. The administration's Poliomyelitis Vaccination Assistance Act of 1955 laid th e foundation for federal involvement in vaccination guidance and funding, upon which s ubsequent administrations\u2014Democratic ones in particular\u2014built, each in an attemp t to meet its own political and economic objectives. Significantly, in the 1970s a nd again in the 1990s, federal childhood immunization programs served as important t ools of health reform, as described in chapter 3. The second major theme running through this work is the framing of disease, a concept borrowed from hi storian Charles Rosenberg.8 Per Rosenberg, we understand and 7 Dorothy Porter, Health, Civilization, and the State (London; New York: Routledge, 1999); Elizabeth Fee, \"Public Health and the Stat e: The United States,\" in The History of Public Health and the Modern State , ed. Dorothy Porter (Atlanta: Rodopi, 1994), 224-275. 8 Charles Rosenberg, \"Disease in History: Frames and Framers,\" Milbank Quarterly 67, no. Supplement 1 (1989): 1-15; Charles Rosenberg, \"Framing Di sease: Illness, Societ y, and History,\" in Framing Disease: Studies in Cultural History , ed. Charles Rosenberg and Janet Go lden (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers 8 explain diseases with the intellectual tools of our time. To date, however, historians have not explored the process by which vaccines a nd the practice of vaccination refashion and interact with these tools, ev en though, as I argue in this work, this has had significant implications for how both scie ntists and lay Americans perc eived their disease targets over time. Diseases are described and underst ood in very different terms over the course of their vaccines' use\u2014 and, more importantly, because of their vaccines' use. Again, the ontology of an infection is in escapable in our understandi ng of it\u2014smallpox virus, for example, mutated into a milder form in the early twentieth century, which influenced lay rejection of enforced small pox vaccination in the Progressive Era, as historian James Colgrove, among others, has noted.9 Mumps, on the other hand, caused the same symptoms and complications in 1980 as it had in 1965, but cultural and scientific descriptions of the infection at these tw o points in time (an effective vaccine was approved for market in 1967) suggest two very different diseases. As described in chapter 2, one was comical and largely harmless, the other destructive if not deadly. Vaccines refocus our attention on their disease target s, which are then re-analyzed and understood anew within the context of their times. On occasion this re-analysis supports the cause of vaccination; at other times it works against it. For instance, the timing of the hepatitis B vaccine's approval, in the 1980s, shaped popular and scientific conceptualizations of the vaccine in a manner that supported the mass v accination of children against the disease. University Press, 1997), xxi - xxvi; Ch arles Rosenberg, \"What Is Disease?,\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 77 (2003): 491-505. 9 James Keith Colgrove, State of Immunity: The Politics of Vaccination in Twentieth-Century America , California/Milbank Books on Health and the Public (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006), 45- 52. 9 By contrast, the socio-cultural context into which the vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) was introduced, in 2006, subjected the vaccine to the specific criticism that its target disease was not intractable enough to warrant the mass compulsory vaccination of children. The third key theme of this dissertation is the interaction between shifting social norms and scientific authority. As new v accine policies took shape in the 1960s and 1970s, feminism, environmentalism, and other social movements were laying challenge to scientific and governmental author ity, with profound\u2014but previously overlooked\u2014 negative implications for how Americans came to think a bout vaccinatio n. A robust body of literature has examined lay resistance to vaccines and vaccine resistance in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, outlin ing dominant refrains in the process. Vaccination critics of a century ago decried vaccines for being unsafe and impure, and rejected enforced vaccination for repres enting a form of tyranny contradicting the principle of personal liberty on which this nation was founded. Religious, rights-based, and safety objections to vaccination are by now historically familiar, but the revival of vaccination skepticism in the la te twentieth century was in la rge part born of the rise of the New Left and its critiques of not just political but social hegemonies. The complex ideological underpinnings of late twentieth-c entury vaccine skepti cism\u2014specifically, the ways in which it was informed as much by traditional libertarian ism as by second-wave feminism and new environmentalism\u2014are a majo r new contribution of this work to the historical literature. The fourth and final major theme of this wo rk is that of the role of children as citizens, and specifically (to borrow a concept from Porter) health citizens. In the last half 10 century, vaccines and vaccine policies fundament ally changed the very nature of what it meant to be a child in the U.S. Infections such as mumps, rubella, chicken pox, and even certain types of diarrhea are no longer the common experiences of childhood that they once were. Instead, their vaccines and the laws and regulations requiring them for school now shape the experience of being a child. This experience\u2014that is, the act of being vaccinated\u2014also constitutes the health ci tizenship responsibilities of children, whose very participation in public li fe is now contingent on thei r immunization status. Policies requiring vaccines for children built on conceptu alizations of children as reservoirs of infection in their communities, as described in chapter 2. They also built on the practical and political expedience of vaccinating children, who with the rise of pediatric care in the first half of the twentieth century had more regimented and malleable contact with health care professionals than civilian adults had. In the second half of the century, I argue, both vaccination policies and vaccine acceptance reflec ted changing cultural valuations of and beliefs about children as fam ily members and as citizens. This dissertation thus cons iders the contemporary histor y of vaccines within the context of a broad set of soci al trends, values, and movement s. In the process, it bridges the history of vaccination to several subfie lds of history, including the history of women, the environment, childhood, and politics. In do ing so, it sheds light on the diversity of factors that shaped both state and individual decision-making with re spect to vaccination at the end of the twentieth century, in order to expand our general understanding of popular and expert attitudes toward and beliefs about vaccines. 11 Historiographical Relevance Compulsory vaccination has been an e ffective means of ensuring widespread adherence to immunization recommendations in the U.S., but the approach has also been hampered by resistance and noncompliance due to a variety of factors, a phenomenon that several historians of American medi cine and social history have described. Ideological resistance to vaccination on the part of anti-vaccinationists has been a particularly popular subject of vaccination histories. An early historiography on the subject\u2014Martin Kaufman's work is an oft-cited example\u2014was judgmental and dismissive of individuals who voiced th eir opposition to vaccines and vaccination campaigns in the nineteenth and early-tw entieth century. Kaufman identified anti- vaccination sentiment with so- called irregular medical practi tioners, including eclectics, hydropaths, homeopaths, and other believers in the \"healing powers of nature.\" In Kaufman's assessment, such practitioners and their adherents wrongly rejected vaccination as part and parcel of a w holesale rejection of orthodox medicine.10 More recently, however, historians have begun to demonstrate that opposition to vaccination has long been a far more complex social and political phenomenon than once thought. Nadav Davidovitch, for instance, has shown that many Victorian-era homeopaths did not reject vaccination as part of their rejection of orthodox medicine; in fact, many accepted it as a vindication of their law of similars. 11 Other historians have 10 Martin Kaufman, \"The American Anti- Vaccinationists and Their Arguments,\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 41, no. 5 (1967): 463-478. 11 Nadav Davidovitch, \"Negotiating Dissent: Homeopath at the Turn of the Twentieth Century,\" in The Politics of Healing: Histories of Alternative Medicine in Twentieth-Century North America , ed. Robert Johnston (New York: Routledge, 2004), 11-28. 12 related attitudes toward vaccination to a broa der set of political values. Michael Willrich has argued that vaccination was a key i ssue for Progressive Era Americans who demanded the preservation of individual libe rties in a time of mounting state power.12 Colgrove has described how Progressive Er a opponents of enforced vaccination in New York believed such policies infringed upon their rights to freedom and privacy.13 Robert Johnston has described a similar dispute in Progressive Era Portland, Oregon, where, he argued, anti-vaccinationists equated a lack of freedom in medical decision-making with political and religious oppression.14 These historians and othe rs have illuminated the deeper meanings of anti-vaccinationist activ ity, namely by placing such activity in robust historical context. Johnston, for instance, has argued that Progressive Era anti- vaccinationists were neither \"ignorant, del uded, [nor] marginal,\" and has urged other historians to view their struggl e as a populist crusade rooted in a belief in the ideal of full political participation of an informed citizenry.15 Much of the existing scholarship on \"anti -vaccination\" has focused on the clashes between medical professionals, health offici als, and active opponent s of vaccination a century ago or more. Johnston and Colgrove, however, have also analyzed contemporary opposition to vaccination. Colgrove has investig ated the success of state efforts to 12 Michael Willrich, \"\"The Least Vaccinated of Any Civilized Country\": Person al Liberty and Public Health in the Progressive Era,\" The Journal of Policy History 20, no. 1 (2008): 76-93; Michael Willrich, Pox: An American History (New York: Penguin Press, 2011). 13 James Keith Colgrove, \"\"Science in a Democracy\": The Contested Status of Vaccination in the Progressive Era and the 1920s,\" Isis 96 (2005): 167-191. 14 Robert Johnston, The Radical Middle Class: Populist Democracy and the Question of Capitalism in Progressive Era Portland, Oregon (Princeton: Prin ceton University Press, 2003). 15 Ibid. 13 encourage vaccination\u2014and popular faith in vaccines\u2014during the 1960s and 1970s, as well as the growing number of individuals w ho challenged vaccine policies in the 1980s and 1990s, on the one hand echoing earlier activ ists' assertions of freedom, and on the other demanding safer vaccines.16 Johnston, meanwhile, has described how contemporary anti-vaccine groups have strained to shake off the \"anti-vaccinationist\" label, arguing that they are not against vaccines on principle, but rather are in favor of safer vaccines as well as the parental right to choose which vaccine s their children receive. Johnston has argued that contemporary anti-vaccinationism has distan ced itself from its historical antagonism, and has moved instead \"toward an emphasis on what it views as the best traditions of modern medicine: better vaccines, be tter science, and informed consent.\"17 Indeed, the term anti-vaccinationist is an inadequate term for descri bing vaccination resistance in the late twentieth and early twen ty-first century, as it fails to encompass lay Americans' varied and selective objections to vaccines in this period, from blanket rejection of all vaccines to circumspection about only certain vaccines or vaccine types\u2014a position well illustrated by the decisions of the Hansen family described at the beginning of this introduction. This dissertation also engages with ex tant scholarship on popular responses to vaccination policies in other democracies, such as Roy and Dorothy Porter's and Nadja Durbach's analyses of the anti-vaccinati on movement in late-nineteenth and early- twentieth century England, and Paul Gree nough's account of resistance to the global 16 Colgrove, State of Immunity: The Politics of Vaccination in Twentieth-Century America . 17 Johnston, \"Contemporary Anti-Vaccination Movements in Historical Perspective.\" 14 smallpox eradication campaign as it was carried out in South Asia in the 1970s.18 Much of the work described thus far, howev er, analyzes the phenomenon of vaccination resistance; far less scholarship has focused, as does this dissertation, on the range of attitudes toward vaccination and their meanings that evolved at the end of the twentieth century in the U.S. Specifically, this di ssertation breaks new ground by revealing the process by which vaccines frame disease; illustrating how vaccination policies and attitudes have been influenced by shifting gender norms and environmental values; and demonstrating the importance of vaccinati on to Democratic political agendas and reforms. Several scholars have examined the role th at vaccines have played in the history of disease. The most familiar example comes from the history of smallpox, the disease against which the first vaccine was developed at the end of the eighteenth century; in the twentieth century, smallpox's v accine was deployed in a su ccessful and much-storied effort to eradicate the disease from the face of the earth. 19 The role of vaccines has dominated other disease histor ies as well. As historian Evelyn Hammonds has noted, no aspect of diphtheria's story in the early tw entieth century has rece ived more attention than the development of its immunization, one of the earliest and most visible products of 18 Nadja Durbach, Bodily Matters: The Anti-Vaccination Movement in England, 1853-1907 (Durham: Duke University Press, 2005); Dorothy Porter and Roy Porter, \"The Po litics of Prevention: Anti-Vaccinationism and Public Health in Nineteenth-Century England,\" History 32, no. 3 (1988): 231-252; Paul Greenough, \"Intimidation, Coercion and Resistance in the Final Stages of the South Asian Smallpox Eradication Campaign, 1973-1975,\" Social Science and Medicine 41, no. 5 (1995): 633-645. 19 Donald A. Henderson, Smallpox: The Death of a Disease (New York: Prometheus Books, 2009). 15 the bacteriological developments of the late nineteenth century.20 In the middle of the twentieth century, \"furious competition\" for a vaccine dominated the story of polio, as David Oshinsky has described. 21 These works regard vaccines as a singular, though important, component in the larger history of disease. This dissertation, by contrast, regards diseases as one component in the la rger story of vaccines. Vaccines would not exist without their target diseases, of course , and the role of vacci nes in eradicating or controlling diseases is well es tablished. But vaccines also fundamentally reconfigure the way in which we interact with and understand their target infections; I argue that they therefore play an important role in the so cial construction and framing of disease, a phenomenon that has not been explicitly explored by other historians. Also unexplored is the influence of the so cial changes of the last half century on vaccine policies and reception, even though th e influence of shifting social dynamics has been a major focus of scholarship in the history of medicine in recent decades. In the last few decades, for instance, a growing number of historians have turned a feminist lens on the history of pharmaceuticals. In particular, the work of such hist orians as Elizabeth Watkins, Andrea Tone, and Susan Speaker ha s situated the history of specific drugs within the context of the feminist and women's health movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Their findings have shown how gender ha s influenced patterns of drug promotion, development, and use; they and others have also shown how the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s, including the feminist, women's health, and consumer rights 20 Evelynn Maxine Hammonds, Childhood's Deadly Scourge: The Campaign to Control Diphtheria in New York City, 1880 - 1930 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002), 88. 21 David M.

The history of women's interactions with the medical profession is thus directly relevant to the history of vaccination. Johnston and Colgrove have described the emergence in the early 1980s of a group of parents, largely mothers, who or ganized to advocate for safer vaccines and vaccine policies in the U.S., following case reports of hazards allegedly stemming from the pertussis component of the DPT vaccine, wh ich protects against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus.23 Women emerged as leaders among these advocates, and much of the advocates' publicity efforts, in cluding the public ation of the book DPT: A Shot in the Dark , featured first-hand account s from mothers whose children were reportedly harmed 22 Elizabeth Watkins, On the Pill: A Social History of Oral Contraceptives, 1950-1970 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998); Elizabeth Watkins, The Estrogen Elixir: A History of Hormone Replacement Therapy in America (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007); Andrea Tone, The Age of Anxiety: A History of America' s Turbulent Affair with Tranquilizers (New York: Basic ational Cultural Assessment of Minor Tranquilizers in America, 1955-1980,\" Journal of the History of Medicine 52 (1997): 338-376; Sandra Morgen, Into Our Own Hands: The Women's Health Movement in the United States, 1969-1970 (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutg ers University Press, 2002). 23 Johnston, \"Contemporary Anti-V Movements in Histori cal Perspective.\"; Colgrove, State Immunity: The Politics of Vaccination in Twentieth-Century America . 17 by vaccines.24 Despite women's prominent roles as vaccine activists, women's attitudes toward vaccines and the role of gender in shaping respons es to vaccines and vaccine policies in the late twentieth century U.S. have received little sp ecific attention from scholars of the medical humanities. And yet th ere is substantial evidence to suggest that gender has played a measurable role in vacc ine reception and vaccine policy; sociologist Jacob Heller's research on th e rubella vaccine, for instance, has suggested that attitudes toward women and women's health issues (s pecifically, abortion) shaped the discourse around that disease as well as vaccin e policy from the 1940s through the 1960s.25 This dissertation therefore builds on this existing scholarship to demonstrate two previously unexplored phenomena from the last half of the twentieth cen tury: changing gender norms had a discernable role in shaping ne w vaccination policies in the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of second-wave feminism a nd the related women's health movement informed consumer doubts about the safety a nd necessity of vaccines and the wisdom of vaccination policies. Likewise, little historical work has direct ly related environmental ethics to beliefs about vaccines and vaccine-pr eventable disease in the late-twentieth century U.S. In recent years, scholars in the history of medi cine and health sciences have increasingly bridged the field with that of environmenta l history, revealing the unexpected ways in which environmental factors have influenced un derstandings of health and experiences of illness and disease. Conevery Bolton Valenciu s's work, for instance, has illustrated the 24 Harris Coulter and Barbara Loe Fisher, A Shot in the Dark: Why the P in the DPT Vaccination May Be Hazardous to Your Child's Health (Garden City Park, N.Y.: Avery Publishing Group, 1991). 25 Jacob Heller, The Vaccine Narrative (Nashville: Vanderbilt Un iversity Press, 2008). 18 common metaphors nineteenth centu ry settlers of the American west used to make sense of both their bodies and their physical environment.26 Greg Mitman's study of allergy in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries ha s shown how the experience of allergy was shaped by environmental factors and simulta neously influenced how people treated and perceived the environments around them.27 Michelle Murphy's anal ysis of sick building syndrome has investigated how the construc tion and manipulation of the physical (and social) environment can direct the experien ce of illness as well as responses to it.28 This form of analysis has reiterated that attitudes toward and beliefs about health and medicine are influenced by and simultaneous influe nce environmental values and beliefs. So far, however, this type of cr oss disciplinary analysis\u2014exploring understandings of and responses to the e nvironment in order to illuminate popular understandings of the body and illness\u2014has yet to be done with a focus on vaccination in the late twentieth cen tury. Scholars have produced evid ence to suggest that attitudes toward vaccination are indeed shaped by envi ronmental values, and it is well-established that vaccination resisters from the Victorian era through th e twentieth century decried vaccines as unnatural and therefore unsafe.29 But the precise ways in which these beliefs in the late twentieth century were inform ed by contemporaneous environmental politics 26 Conevery Bolton Valencius, The Health of the Country: How American Settlers Understood Themselves and Their Land (New York: Basic Books, 2002). 27 Gregg Mitman, Breathing Space: How Allergies Shape Our Lives and Landscapes (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2007). 28 Michelle Murphy, Sick Building Syndrome and the Problem of Uncertainty: Environmental Politics, Technoscience, and Women Workers (Durham: Duke University Press, 2006). 29 See for example Durbach, Bodily Matters: The Anti-Vaccination Movement in England, 1853-1907 ; Emily Martin, Flexible Bodies: Tracking Immunity in American Culture from the Days of Polio to the Age of AIDS (Boston: Beacon Press, 1994). 19 and values has not yet been examined. This dissertation shows that vaccine skepticism based on theories of natural healing in this period drew on century- old beliefs about the benignity of nature as well as uniquely late-twentieth century ideas about ecology, chemical exposures, scientific uncertainty, a nd risk, all of which were popularized by new environmentalism. Finally, no historian of vaccination has b een able to ignore the challenges faced by the practice of compulsory immunizati on in nations founded on principles of individual liberty. As Dorothy Porter has recounted, opponents to Britain's Compulsory Vaccination acts, enacted in 1853 and 1867, cite d vaccination failures, dangers, and the acts' encroachment on individual rights to justify their resist ance. Indeed, struggles over enforced vaccination throughout histor y\u2014in Britain, the U.S., and beyond\u2014have highlighted public health's ongoing struggle for balance betw een personal rights and the common good in democratic societies. The question of how far governments may go in curtailing individual rights for the great er good is not limited to the history of vaccination; it is also a key source of dispute in the history of efforts to manage sexually transmitted diseases and mental health.30 The popularity of universal childhood immunization campaigns among late-twentieth ce ntury Democratic administrations in the U.S. raises additional questions, not only about what ideological positions such efforts (and resistance to them) reflected, but also what political goals they served. This dissertation builds on existing analyses of the political meanings embedded in socio- 30 See for example Allan M. Brandt, No Magic Bullet: A Social History of Venereal Disease in the United States since 1880 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985); Paul A. Lombardo, Three Generations, No Imbeciles: Eugenics, the Supreme Court, and Buck V. Bell (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008). 20 political vaccination discourses by revealing that the mass vaccination of children in the late twentieth century served as an important testing ground fo r Democratic presidents to gauge popular acceptance of the expansion of universal health care programs; it also served as an expedient means for achievi ng budgetary and health reform goals for administrations with an express interest in expanding the reach of welfare state. The Science and Regulation of Vaccines Any discussion of the socio-politics of vaccination must be understood in the context of the science of vaccines. Vaccines protect against disease by prompting the body's immune system to generate antibodies and other immune cells that recognize and attack bacteria and viruse s. Vaccines protect individuals, but they also protect communities\u2014when a sufficient fraction of th e population is vaccinated against a virus or bacterium, the entire population is pr otected, because the decreased number of susceptible people means the pathogen no l onger has enough \"hosts\" to sustain itself in that population. The phenomenon of herd immunity means that not every individual in a community needs to be vaccinated to control or even eradicate a disease. As long as enough members of the herd are protected, the whole \"herd\" is protected\u2014including those who didn't get vaccinated or couldn't, fo r reasons such as, for example, age or pre- existing diseases affecting the immune system. Vaccines themselves contain all or part of the target pathogen, sometimes in its live form, and sometimes killed or in a weaken ed state. The Salk polio vaccine (the polio vaccine currently in use), for example, consists of inactivated or killed polio virus, which triggers the immune system to manufacture anti bodies that are effective against live polio 21 virus. Pertussis vaccine in its original form contained killed whole pertussis bacteria; the \"acellular\" pertussis vaccine now in use cont ains only key proteins from the bacteria. Vaccines against smallpox, measles, mumps, rubella, and rotavirus are live virus vaccines, meaning they contain a live version of the target viru s. In each case, the virus in the vaccine has been weakened or altered, either through passag e in animal cells or (more recently) through genetic engineering.31 The altered virus doesn't cause disease, but it is still familiar enough to the immune system to trigger the formation of antibodies. So-called \"recombinant protein\" vaccines, such as the vaccines against hepatitis B virus and HPV, contain antigens that were produced by genetically engineered or recombinant microorganisms; the hepatitis B vaccine, for example, contains antigens manufactured by recombinant yeast. 32 Vaccines are highly effective, but because of their very nature as biological products, they have been, on rare occasion, implicated in the spread of disease. Nineteenth century smallpox vaccination in the U.S. and Europe, which in one form involved transferring pus from the arm of one vaccinated person to the next, sometimes transmitted other infections as well, notably syphilis.33 In the U.S., the Biologics Control Act was signed into law in 1902 in response to an episode in which 20 children were sickened and 14 died after receiving dipht heria immunizations contaminated with 31 The rotavirus vaccine, for example, is made from weakened cow rotavirus that contains segments of human rotavirus.

Yet another contamination episode, the so -called Cutter incident\u2014in which polio vaccine manufactured by Cutter Labs was contam inated with live polio virus, causing the disease in more than 200 people\u2014prompted further federal involvement in vaccine regulation in the 1950s. The incide nt led to the establishment of the Division of Biologics Standards within the National Institutes of H ealth (which had been created two decades earlier from the PHS/MHS Hygienic Laboratory) to more carefully monitor vaccine safety. But following reports in the late 1960s and early 1970s that DBS had failed to properly screen vaccines for safety and effectiveness, oversight of vaccines was strengthened and transferred once again, this time to the Food and Drug Administration's new Bureau of Biologics. 35 The bureau, now called the Cent er for Biologics Evaluation and Research, currently regulates and license s both vaccines and vaccine manufacturers, in addition to other biologi cal products and their makers.36 Before licensing a vaccine for use, the FDA's CBER evaluates the vaccine's safety profile, its ability to provoke an imm une response, its ability to protect against disease, and its interaction w ith other drugs and vaccines. Sa fety and efficacy standards for vaccines are flexible. While vaccines are extremely safe, many do pose small inherent 34 Norman Baylor and Karen Midthun, \"Regula tion and Testing of Vaccines,\" in Vaccines Stanley Plotkin, Walter Orenstein, and Paul Offit (Philadelphia: Elsevier, 2008), 1611-1628.

The act was prompted by reports that pert ussis vaccine posed non-disclo sed risks of encephalitis, brain damage, and death. In addition to establishing a National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, the 1986 law also create d the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System. To this day, any individual may submit information on a vaccine reaction to VAERS, which is administered jointly by the FDA and CDC. How This Dissertation Is Organized This dissertation traces the interaction between vaccine science, politics, and society from 1962, when Congress approved th e Vaccination Assistance Act, to 2008, when proposals to make HPV vaccination manda tory for schoolgirls were universally rejected in state legislatures . Chapter 1 describes the growing federal role in setting national vaccination policy and guiding the form and content of polic ies adopted at the state level from the beginning of the twentieth century to th e 1960s. It focuses closely on the Vaccination Assistance Act of 1962 and cont emporaneous events, which set the stage for strong federal involvement in promoting th e universal vaccination of children against a range of diseases in the decades that fo llowed. Chapter 2 examines the history of one disease, mumps, whose vaccine was a product of the scientific developments of the 1940s 37 Ibid. 24 and 1950s that ushered in what vaccine scientists call the \"golden age of vaccine development.\"38 Mumps' pre- and post-vaccine hist ory reveals the role that vaccine technologies and policies played in reshaping co nceptions of and approaches to infectious disease; its story also serves as a window onto evolving vaccine science and policy more broadly in the 1960s and 1970s. Chapter 3 analyzes the dramatic push for childhood vaccination made by the Carter administrati on, and contrasts this approach with the subsequent push made by the Clinton administ ration fifteen years la ter. Taken together, both efforts were key in making school v accine laws the norm, making vaccinations available to all children, and ensuring that vaccination rates steadily climbed (as they generally, if imperfectly, did) from the 1970s through today. Chapters 4 and 5 examine the influence of shifting social norms and new social movements on vaccine policy and reception from the 1970s through the 1990s. Chapter 4 considers the impact of cha nging ideas about gender and, more specifically, the rise of second wave feminism and the women's heal th movement on vaccine policies and how women (especially mothers) received them . Chapter 5 examines the influence of a contemporaneous social movement, environmentalism, on how lay Americans understood vaccines and the risks they posed rela tive to the risks of the diseases against which they protected. Chapter 6 returns to a case study of a disease, using the story of hepatitis B to examine changing vaccine polic ies, the framing of vaccine-preventable disease, and the continued gr owth of vaccination resistance from the 1980s through the turn of the twenty-first centur y. The dissertation's conclusion uses these trends to analyze 38 Plotkin and Plotkin, \"A Short History of Vaccination,\" 7. 25 the fate of the vaccine against HPV, which was introduced in 2006, and which remains much debated in the media and me dical literature through today. The story outlined in this work highlight s several unresolved questions about the very nature and purpose of vaccines. Vacci nes are developed in response to disease threats, but they also fundamentally change how we think about disease. They are an important medical technology, but have been just as important as political tools in an era plagued by tensions over the cost and provisi on of health care. Resistance to vaccination and vaccine policy in recent decades has been complicated and deeply layered, and informed by social trends whose influence has yet to be fully explored. But just as interesting a line of historic al inquiry concerns the quest ion of how and why Americans came to accept the universal vaccination of thei r children against such a long and varied list of infections in the last decades of the twentieth century. The answer, as this dissertation demonstrates, has varied by v accine and by historical moment, but has always reflected cultural att itudes toward technology, state power, social hegemonies, children, and even toward disease itself. 26 Chapter 1 When is One Case Too Many? The Federal Government and Disease Prevention Through Vaccination, 1900-1968 In a speech before the American Me dical Association in 1963, Dr. James Goddard, head of the nation's Communicable Disease Center,1 summed up Americans' prevailing notions regarding vaccines: that they were for children; that they were needed only upon school entry; and, thanks to the nati on's experience fighting polio, that a one- time vaccination campaign was all that was need ed to wipe out an infectious disease. Goddard, a physician himself, pressed the asse mbled doctors to counteract these notions in their patients and urge them to get vaccina ted against not just polio, but also smallpox, diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus. For, sa id Goddard, although these diseases were \"of relatively minor importance in this country,\" they were\u2014thanks to vaccines\u2014\"diseases about which we could say that one is too many.\"2 Goddard's speech was part of a larger federal push to promote vaccination, which was expedited by legislation signed into la w by president John F. Kennedy in late 1962. Kennedy's Vaccination Assistance Act, a pers onal project of the president, provided states with federal funds to fight vaccin e-preventable diseases broadly, and it set a precedent for federal involvement in vaccinati on promotion that subsequent Democratic 1 Now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2 Diphtheria Immunization Against Smallpox, Tetanus, and Poliomyelitis, Speech Given by James L.

He and colleagues at the CDC were frustrated that vaccination rates for smallpox, diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus weren't as high as they could be. Americans' willingness to be vaccinated against polio, however, indicated to them a window of opportunity to encourage higher vacci nation uptake overall. (It also revealed a lay ambivalence toward the practice, whic h CDC officials would soon find themselves working to overcome.) That Goddard took the agency's message to the AMA illustrated the federal government's newfound authorit y in disease prevention via vaccination. Federal health officials would effectivel y wield this new authority to promote a vaccination agenda that would continue expanding into the 1970s and beyond. That this new vaccination agenda involved immunizing Americans against infections of \"relatively minor importance\" was also significant, as it represented another defining aspect of this turning point in the hi story of vaccination in the U.S. In the late 1960s, children would begin to become routinel y vaccinated against a growing number of infections, and despite the fact that some of these in fections could be described as \"minor\" in any way in 1963, none of them would be so described by the end of the 1970s. This reframing of these vaccine-preventable infections, a phenomenon that is examined in depth in Chapter 2, was one of several factors crucial to the success of this new federal agenda. 3 The \"mass immunization\" bill, as it was called by Kennedy staffers, was on the President's list of major legislative proposals for 1962, along with acts on trade expansion, tax reform, the Peace Corps, and a farm bill. One of the president's congressional liaisons called it a \"major point of President Kennedy's legislative program.\" Memo, Mumps Epidemics in Campbell and Fleming Counties, Folder: Legislative Files 5/1-18/62, Box 50, President's Office Files, Legi slative Files, John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. 28 All told, this period marked the nascen ce of a new era of mass vaccination, which began midway through the twentieth century an d persists to this day, characterized by general acceptance of federal au thority in the area of vaccination and the widespread administration of new vaccines, with an eye toward herd immunity or complete disease eradication. The goal of erad ication originally built on th e hubris that shaped the technical professions after World War II. The nation's unpreceden ted investment in scientific and medical research during and after the war yiel ded a substantial list of new vaccines and vaccine technologies, which seem ed to herald progress toward a future untroubled by disease. New vaccines protecte d against yellow fever, flu, polio, measles, rubella, and mumps, and improved versions of old vaccines\u2014including a new vaccine against typhoid and a single s hot that protected against dipht heria, tetanus, and pertussis at once\u2014made old vaccination practices safer and more cost-effective. New technologies, such as the jet injector and bifurcated needle , made vaccination faster and more efficient than ever before; the jet inj ector alone made it possible to vaccinate 1,000 people in a single hour.4 Postwar advances in medicine and lay fa ith in these new technologies combined to make the development of the polio vaccine and its use in the nation's triumphant defeat of the disease a defining aspect of 1950s America. Technological advances and the national crusade against polio, in turn, pave d the way for widely publicized eradication 4 The jet injector, developed by scientists at the Na tional Communicable Disease Center and the U.S. Army Research and Development Command, is best known for its use in the global Smallpox Eradication Program, though it was initially used to administ er both smallpox and measles vaccine.

Polio and smallpox (but not measles) did indeed disappear from the American la ndscape. As these dreaded infections faded from memory and as new vaccines against other infections piled up, federal health officials, now assuming a central role in what had once been a predominantly local affair, promised a new era of freedom from infectious disease. That health officials like Goddard were confident in the fu lfillment of this promise speaks both to their authority and the fa ctors that held it in place. Changes in the nation's disease priorities and na tional defense concerns led to the rise of epidemiology's scientific methods and the growth of the CDC in particular, bu ttressing centralized authority in the realm of v accination. At the same time, mi d-century attitudes toward science and technology in postwar America, new ways of thinking about the economics of disease prevention, and cha nging views of children, families, and their roles as citizens all contributed to new ideas about who to vaccinate against what, and when. Routine compulsory vaccination of children at ever younger ages, even against infections that posed little direct risk to them, became the norm, as did federal dictation of and support for vaccination policies. This expansion of state power at times rubbed up against traditional American ideals regarding the reach and role of government, and at times created inter-professiona l tension, as it represented an e xpansion of public health into a domain that organized medicine had previously tried to claim for its own. On the whole, however, this expansion progressed unimpeded. As a result, American vaccination policy and practice looked quite different in the latter half of the twentieth century than it did in the first half. This chapter traces the evolut ion of federal activities affecting vaccination 30 and the spectrum of attitudes toward these activities and vaccination generally, from the start of the twentieth century to the early 1960s, to illustra te why and how the stage was set for this new era of vaccination to begin. Jacobson v. Massachusetts: Federal Va lidation for Compulsory Vaccination For the first half of the twentieth century and before, vaccination as an American public health enterprise was an almost en tirely local affair. Throughout most of the nineteenth century, smallpox was the only in fection that could be thwarted with a vaccine.5 When the infection threatened ports and broke out in bustling cities, city councils and health departments took measures to isolate the sick and vaccinate the well, often writing, interpreting, and testing applic able local laws and regulations in the process.6 Efforts to mandate vaccination of h ealthy citizens during epidemics of the disease met not infrequently with resistance, which at times culminated in lawsuits. One such lawsuit, however, ultimately put to rest the question of the when and how compulsory vaccination could be applied. In 1902, a smallpox epidemic struck Cambridge, Massachusetts and the city adopted a resolution, in accordance with state law, that required all citizens to either be 5 A history of smallpox inoculation and vaccination (and the disease itself) is given in Hopkins, The Greatest Killer: Smallpox in History . An accessible account of the development and deployment of smallpox vaccine is also given in Part I of Arthur Allen, Vaccine: The Controversial Story of Medicine's Greatest Lifesaver , 1st ed. (New York: W.W. Norton, 2007). 6 See for example Judith Leavitt, \"Politics and Pu blic Health: Smallpox in Milwaukee, 1894-1895,\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 50, no. 4 (1976): 553-568.

But when the city vaccinator arrived at the door of Reverend Henning Jacobson, the reverend refused to do either, citing an invasion of his liberty and the oppressive nature of the law. Jacobson's refusal landed him in court, where he lost his case. But following several appeals, his suit ultimately brought him and his lawyer before the U.S. Supreme Court. 7 Jacobson wasn't to be vindicated: the high court's 1905 decision in Jacobson v. Massachusetts upheld the constitutionality of enforced vaccination. The decision also simulta neously upheld the auth ority of individual states to exercise police power s to protect the health of th eir citizens and established a national precedent for doing so.8 Writing the opinion for the majority in Jacobson v. Massachusetts , Justice John Marshall Harlan argued that despite Revere nd Jacobson's opinion of the Cambridge law, \"the liberty secured by the Constitution...does not impart an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all circumstances , wholly freed from restraint. There are manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good. On any other basis organized society could not exist with safety to its members.\"9 Harlan's opinion, excerpted in medical journals of th e day, was welcomed by health officials and private doctors, who called it \"a source of gratification to the medical profession.\"10 It 7 Colgrove, State of Immunity: The Politics of Vaccination in Twentieth-Century America , 38; Lawrence Gostin, Public Health Law: Power, Duty, Restraint (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000), 66. 8 Gostin, Public Health Law: Power, Duty, Restraint . 9 Jacobson v.

Massachusetts secured police powers for state health departments, but it also placed these powers within a set of well-defined limits. Henning Jacobson's claims had been based, in part, on the beli ef that smallpox vaccination would cause him harm. The Court's determination that he was, in fact, a \"fit subject of vaccination,\" was based on the Justices' extensive reading of the medical litera ture on vaccination's safety and effectiveness, which also led the court to acknowledge that some subjects were in fact not duly \"fit\" to be injected, and that vaccination's potential harms had not been well defined. 13 The Court's resulting decision, as public health legal scholar Lawrence Gostin has noted, thus \"established a floor of constitu tional protection for i ndividual rights,\" as well as four \"standards of judicial review\": Jacobson v. Massachusetts established that 11 Paul Starr, The Social Transformation of American Medicine (New York: Basic Books, 1982), 198-199. 12 Sydney A. Halpern, American Pediatrics: The Social Dynamics of Professionalism, 1880-1980 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988), 58-59; Nancy Tomes, The Gospel of Germs: Men, Women, and the Microbe in American Life (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1998), 46-47, 127-129. 13 This point is made in the discussion of Jacobson v. Massachusetts in Wendy Parmet, Populations, Public Health, and the Law (Washington: Georgetown University Pr ess, 2009), 40. It is also evident in Jacobson v. Massachusetts , 197 U.S. 11 (1905), p. 197 U.S., 36 - 37. 33 compulsory measures to protect health had to be necessary; reasonable; proportional to the extant health threat; and relatively harmless.14 The ruling in Jacobson v. Massachusetts , its limits aside, pr ompted doctors and health officials to predict a triumpha nt future for the cause of vaccination.15 By this time, smallpox was no longer the only vaccine at hand; following Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch's bacteriological discoveries of the late nineteenth century, scientists had developed immunizations against cholera, rabies, anthrax, and plague, and vaccines against tuberculosis, typhoid, and other infections were on the horiz on. But while lawsuits over compulsory vaccination measures did dry up in Jacobson 's wake, lay Americans opposed to the practice began to vigorously tackle them in state legislatures instead.16 (In an era when germs were still a novel idea, enforced vaccination was not only seen as oppressive by some but also, sometimes, as dangerous and suspect.) In what was perhaps an unexpected turn at the time, state laws , which were in fact rare before Jacobson , became even scarcer afterward.17 Just 11 states had compulsory vaccinati on laws prior to 1905.

Progressives, a group that comprised both lay activists and professionals , energetically sought to rectify society's ills by uncovering political corruption, educating immigrants and the poor, and taking messages of health promotion and diseas e prevention into neighborhoods, homes, and schools. 20 This largely middle-class movement wa s resisted by citizens who perceived it as an affront to privacy and freedom, as some did when Progressive ardor manifested in energetic vaccination drives. Anti-Progressi ve attitudes were well-encapsulated by medical libertarian and vaccination crit ic Lora Little, who in her 1906 book Crimes of the Cowpox Ring decried the \"corporation spirit\" of the medical profession, the \"business health professi onals, and society's \"meddle mania.\"21 The resistance movement to which Little belonged was dwar fed by the larger social movement of her 18 Samuel Woodward, \"Arguments in Favor of Compulsory Vaccina tion for Private School Children,\" New England Journal of Medicine 206, no. 11 (1932): 570-572. 19 See Chapter 12 in Johnston, The Radical Middle Class: Populis t Democracy and the Question of Capitalism in Progressive Era Portland, Oregon .

Diphtheria Immunization and Medical Authority Even as Progressive Era critics like Lora Little made gains against compulsory smallpox vaccination, diphtheria immunization became widely accepted, establishing itself as a staple of childhood medical care. Though the diphtheria vaccine emerged from the same set of discoveries that had led to the development of shots against rabies, anthrax, typhoid, tuberculosis, and cholera, it was the first of these to be used on a widespread scale to contro l an infectious disease.22 In the 1910s and 1920s, New York City\u2014and then New York state\u2014led the nation' s most aggressive and spirited campaigns to stamp out the bacterial infection through mass immunizatio n, manufacturing and distributing the antitoxin injection and pub licizing its benefits in newspaper and magazine ads, promotional films, poste rs on streetcars, and radio broadcasts.23 Capitalizing on the rise of advertising and consumer responsiveness, the health department did not stop with l eaflets and pages in the paper, but went on to stage street performances, erect massive rotating billboa rds in Times Square, and sponsor a dogsled race through lower Manhattan to attract the public's attention.24 22 See Chapter 3 in Hammonds, Childhood's Deadly Scourge: The Campaign to Control Diphtheria in New York City, 1880 - 1930 , 6-7. 23 For an analysis of New York City's anti-diphtheria campaign, see Ibid. 24 New York's anti-diphtheria campaign is also described in brief in Colgrove, State of Immunity: The Politics of Vaccination in Twentieth-Century America , 88-93. 36 Diphtheria causes a membrane to form over the throat and tonsils, leading to sore throat, painful swallowing, and breathing difficu lty. A steady, constant presence in turn- of-the-century cities, it dema nded a mass marketing campaign in a way that smallpox did not. Because diphtheria did not appear as s uddenly in the population and was not as life- threatening as smallpox, populations needed encouragement that it was in fact worth preventing. On the other hand, because its im munization left no scar (like smallpox vaccination did), and didn't cause disease (like both smallpox and typhoid vaccination sometimes did), it was a relatively easy sell.25 Marketing aside, however, there were several other key distinc tions between New York's promotion of diphtheria immunization and the local smallpox vaccina tion pushes that preceded it, both in New York and across the country. Throughout the nineteenth century, smallpox vaccination was typically encouraged\u2014usually through mand ate\u2014by cities and municipalities on an ad-hoc basis, often in reaction to imminent epidemics. In New York's anti-diphtheria campaign, by contrast, health officials inspired by the promise of the new bacteriological tools at their disposal took aim at a long-entrenched diseas e and determined not just to reduce the number of cases of the disease, but to stamp it out entirel y. Indeed, as historian Evelynn Hammonds has argued, health offici als undertook the imm unization-based anti- diphtheria campaign to prove the supremacy of laboratory science over sanitary approaches in controlling infectious disease for good. 26 25 See Ibid; Hammonds, Childhood's Deadly Scourge: The Campaign to Control Diphtheria in New York City, 1880 - 1930 ; Heller, The Vaccine Narrative . 26 Hammonds, Childhood's Deadly Scourge: The Campaign to Control Diphtheria in New York City, 1880 - 1930 , 73-74. 37 This emphasis on eradication marked a significant shift in public health approaches to disease. Sociologist Jac ob Heller has argued that New York's anti- diphtheria campaign redefined the focus of v accination campaigns from the prevention of deaths, the objective of smallpox vaccination, to the prevention of sickness, the primary objective of diphtheria vaccination (even though diphtheria itself could be fatal, too).27 The fact that New York health officials were successful in this endeavor also speaks to the expanding cultural authority of medicine ge nerally at the time, a trend that diphtheria vaccination actually helped shape.28 As sociologist Paul Star r has noted, medicine may have had little to offer every sore throat sufferer, but that didn 't stop parents from wanting doctors to inspect their children, on the off chance that they were in fact infected with diphtheria and could benefit from the new vaccine. 29 (In its earliest iteration, diphtheria immunization, a combin ation of the toxin produced by diphtheria bacteria and its antitoxin, both treat ed and temporarily prevented the disease.) Public health's growing reliance on la boratory techniques over the sanitary methods it had espoused in the nineteenth cen tury frequently put the profession at odds with medicine.30 Their dispute, as Starr has argued, typically concerned where the line between treatment (the traditional domain of medicine) and prev ention (the domain of 27 Heller, The Vaccine Narrative , 40. 28 Starr, The Social Transformation of American Medicine , 138; Hammonds, Childhood's Deadly Scourge: The Campaign to Control Diphtheria in New York City, 1880 - 1930 , 11. 29 Starr, The Social Transformation of American Medicine , 139. 30 The shift from sanitary to bacteriological method s in public health is described in John Duffy, The Sanitarians: A History of American Public Health (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1990). 38 public health) was drawn.31 With diphtheria, this line wa sn't easy to see. New York's diphtheria campaign drew deliberately on labo ratory methods for diagnosis of existing cases and immunization against potential ones. Perhaps paradoxically, the publicity it deliberately generated also drove parents to doctors' offices and further solidified the cultural authority of physicians.32 The diphtheria campaign also thus drew yet another line between public health and medicine: the former demonstrated the need for prevention, and the latter actually provided it\u2014at least to the ch ildren of middle and upper class families, for whom medical care , in the early decades of the twentieth century, was an increasingly sought-after commodity.33 The successes attributable to diphtheria i mmunization in this period are debatable; Historian James Colgrove points out that as many as two-thirds of children were already immune to the infection when the immuni zation campaign got underway, and diphtheria rates fell through the 1930s even as immunization rates stayed level or fell themselves.34 But the campaign succeeded in establishing va ccination as the preeminent approach to infectious disease management in the new century. According to Heller, New York's anti-diphtheria campaign constructed a new narr ative of disease contro l, with vaccination, a product of laboratory science, in the starri ng role. In this narrative, which would be repeated several times over the course of the twentieth century, a germ was identified in 31 Starr, The Social Transformation of American Medicine , 196. 32 Hammonds, Childhood's Deadly Scourge: The Campaign to Control Diphtheria in New York City, 1880 - 1930 , 10-11. 33 Halpern, American Pediatrics: The Social Dynamics of Professionalism, 1880-1980 , 94-102. 34 Colgrove, State of Immunity: The Politics of Vaccination in Twentieth-Century America , 107. 39 the lab; a vaccine against the germ was de veloped; the vaccine was tested in the population and, once proven safe and effective, administered on a ma ssive scale; lastly, the aim of disease eradication was declared.35 This narrative indeed held true for diphtheria; later, it would hold true for po lio, measles, rubella, and eventually, as discussed in the next chapter, mumps. Diphtheria eradication was never achieved, neither in New York nor elsewhere. As diphtheria rates declined throughout the 1930 s, New York health officials struggled to defend the continuation of their costly and resource-intensive anti -diphtheria campaign, which, with 125,000 infants born each year, se emed to call for \"perpetual\" effort.36 Some experts called instead for a move to make th e vaccine compulsory for all children, which would circumvent the need for perpetual pe rsuasion, but consensus on the issue could not be met. Indeed, throughout the 1930s, doctors and public health sc ientists across the country continued to work on clarifying the ma ny uncertainties that remained regarding diphtheria immunization, even in the wake of New York's campaign. The immunization's effectiveness a nd its duration of protection we re still being quantified, and health and medical professi onals debated in the literature and at conferences whether immunization was indeed responsible for diphtheria's decline in New York and elsewhere, or whether it was due to \"unknow n factors governing the natural cycles of disease.\"37 35 See Chapter 1 in Heller, The Vaccine Narrative . 36 Colgrove, State of Immunity: The Politics of Vaccination in Twentieth-Century America , 109. 37 Frank Harder, Abraham Gelperin, and Walter Cook , \"Active Immunization against Diphtheria: The Efficacy of Several Methods Used in a City of Medium Size,\" American Journal of Public Health 29, no. 10 (1939): 1119-1124. 40 Many health officials in New York and beyond seemed to agree nonetheless with the editors of the American Journal of Public Health , who called diphtheria immunization \"our most important [and widely accepted] success in the prevention of disease by specific immunization.\"38 They saw diphtheria immunization's safety, popularity, and effectiveness as adequate justification for making the shots compulsory, arguing that at present the re sponsibility for immunizing child ren rested with the family physician, who was generally \"rather negligent in recommending this valuable life-saving procedure to his clientele.\"39 Family physicians, meanwhile, we re split on the issue, with those resisting widespread di phtheria immunization often seei ng it as a threat to their professional responsibilities.40 \"In public health work, where there is not the close relationship between parents, doc tors, and children that there is in private practice, it is essential...that the methods used be as far as possible above criticis m. Seventy per cent immunity, which is a generous estimate for [diphtheria immunization], is not sufficient security for children,\" said San Fran cisco pediatrician H.E. Thelander.41 As the story of diphtheria immunization demonstrat es, the products of nineteen th-century bacteriological discoveries had caused medicine and public health to converge upon a single, contested 38 Editorial, \"Immunization against Diphtheria,\" American Journal of Public Health 26, no. 7 (1936): 733- 734. 39 Ibid. The attitudes of public health and medical professionals are summarized based on letters and reports in their respective professional journals from this period. 40 For further discussion of the tension between public health and medicine at this time, see Starr, The Social Transformation of American Medicine , 185-186. 41 Lillian Kositza, \"Diphtheria Immunization,\" California and Western Medicine 39, no. 5 (1933): 322-327. 41 territory in the early twentieth century.42 Caught up in the dispute between the two professions, statutes and re gulations making diphtheria im munization compulsory were therefore rare by the end of the 1930s. By 1942, only North Carolina required the shots for children; New Jersey and a few other stat es empowered districts to make the shots a condition of school enrollment as they saw f it; and Kansas and a few others authorized schools to exclude unimmunized children during outbreaks.43 But on the whole, despite diphtheria immunization's apparent acceptance among the public, states were either unwilling to require it of their citizens or simply didn't see a need to do so. Compulsion Revisited? Over the same period of time, state hea lth officials increasingly debated\u2014with more energy than they devoted to dipht heria immunization\u2014the merits of expanding compulsory smallpox vaccination. In the 1910s and 1920s, improved state-level data collection on smallpox cases revealed that the infection was still rampant, making the U.S. \"the most smallpox ridden country in the world bar possibl y China, India and (doubtfully) Russia,\" in the words of Massac husetts Medical Society president Samuel Woodward.44 By the 1930s, state-level data also br ought into stark relief the difference in smallpox rates between states with compulso ry vaccination laws a nd those without.

In the same period, Utah, which prohibited compulsory vaccination, had over 13,000 cases among its population of less than half a million residents. 45 In letters and edito rials penned throughout the 1930s, doctors and health officials expressed concerns about the ease with whic h the infection crosse d borders; the burden on schools when a single child fell ill; and the economic costs of smallpox. Caring for a smallpox patient cost $150, one St. Louis heal th officer noted, whereas vaccinating that same patient would have cost 4 cents.46 Medical and public health journals reported approvingly on the successes of compulso ry vaccination measures in Europe and elsewhere.47 Only a minority expressed worry th at mandating smallpox vaccination more widely would place the medical and public heal th professions on the edge of a slippery slope. If Massachusetts su cceeded in enacting a much debated 1930 bill to require smallpox vaccination of all infants, worried phy sician J. Walter Schirmer (presciently), \"what is to prevent our having laws enacted requiring [diphtheria immunization], and, as vaccines are developed from time to time, for use in the prevention of scarlet fever, 45 Ibid. 46 Ibid. 47 See for example, Ibid; Woodward, \"Arguments in Favor of Compulsory Vacci nation for Private School Children.\"; Fred Moore, \"Responsibilities of the Medical Profession in Health Program of Public Schools,\" The Journal of the Americ an Medical Association 94, no. 15 (1930): 1109-1112. 43 measles, whooping cough, influe nza, colds, etc., etc.\"48 Looking to the past, Schirmer worried that vaccines would be rendered usel ess by new discoveries; looking forward, he saw in their mandated use a looming dystopia: \"Perhaps...in the not distant future, we shall be required to report each morning at some laboratory for the hypodermic dose necessary to protect us agai nst the hazards of that part icular day. I do not wish to condemn the use or value of these agents to health, but...history has shown that so many of the therapeutic agen ts of medicine become obsolete in time.\" 49 Worries such as Schirmer's however, were only infrequently articulated in the 1930s. While health officials often encourag ed vaccination against smallpox, diphtheria, and typhoid, vaccination was rarely enforced. Th e Depression resulted in declining use of medical services overall, as well as diminish ed capacity on the part of local governments to launch vaccination campaigns. Even if m oney had not been an issue, professional opposition would have been. In the negotiations to adopt a set of social policies to restore economic security to the country\u2014Preside nt Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal\u2014the American Medical Association voiced fier ce opposition to any form of government intervention in the provision of health care.50 The AMA's position set the tone for the relationship between medicine and state in the 1930s: none. With nothing oppressive to resist, outspoken vaccine resistance, in turn, became increasingly rare. By now, it was 48 J. Walter Schirmer, \"A Defense of Anti-Vaccination Sentiments,\" New England Journal of Medicine 202, no. 10 (1930): 507. 49 Ibid. 50 David Blumenthal and James A.

Massachusetts had successfully curbed vaccination lawsuits, too; a 1942 survey of state di phtheria immunization laws not ed that roughly four decades of diphtheria immunization efforts had not resulted in a single court case.51 But perhaps nothing did more to quiet outspoken vaccination skepticism and swell popular sentiment in favor of vaccines than the second World War. Wartime news reports frequently told of the role vacci nes were playing in protecting troops and civilians. Thanks to vaccines, the papers reported, American troops were safe from tetanus, pneumonia, Rocky Mountain spotted fe ver, and yellow fever, and they would soon be protected against flu, one of the \"for emost military scourges\" of the first World War, too.52 In Europe, headlines announced, vacc ines had thwarted the spread of epidemics among allied troops in France and saved two million civilians from typhoid in war-torn Warsaw.53 When measles vaccine was discovered in 1940, it was described as a tool that would protect soldie rs from the pneumonia epidemics that frequently followed measles outbreaks in military encampments.54 Vaccines, that is, were deftly woven into the narrative Americans told (and were told) about the role scien tific and technological prowess played in making the U.S. the leader of the free world. 51 Fowler, \"State Diphtheria Immunization Requirements.\" 52 Gerald Gross, \"U.S. Army Better Equipped Today to Fight Disease Than in 1917,\" The Washington Post , October 8, 1940, 10; \"Influenza Immunization Test Started by Navy,\" Los Angeles Times , July 29, 1941, A5. 53 United Press, \"France Fights Epidemics,\" New York Times , August 5, 1940, 4; Alvin Steinkopf, \"Reich at War with Typhoid in Polish State,\" The Washington Post , October 14, 1940, 6. 54 Associated Press, \"Tell Discovery of a Vaccine to Avoid Measles,\" Chicago Daily Tribune , September 18, 1940, 1. 45 As the war progressed, health officials ur ged residents of U.S. cities to get immunized against smallpox and diphtheria to protect themselves against infections spread by migrating war workers and, late r, soldiers returning home from war.55 Vaccination was necessary to protect against epidemics and also to maintain a robust, war-ready population back home. New York he alth official Leona Baumgartner was one of many to note that wartime personnel shortage s made it apparent \"that it is of utmost importance that all needless illness be cut to a minimum.\"56 At the height of the war, Americans seemed to agree. In 1943, Baumgart ner reported results of a poll of American attitudes toward immunization: upwards of 90 percent trusted that vaccinations protected against death and serious illness, leading Baumgartner to conclude that most Americans were \"ready\" for immunization procedures. 57 Their readiness was indeed apparent in 1947, when a smallpox outbreak threatened New York City and more than 6 million New Yorkers patiently (and reportedly cheerfully ) lined up to get voluntarily vaccinated.58 Historian Judith Leavitt has attributed New York ers' alacrity to the voluntary nature of the city's vaccination campaign as well as the spirit of coope ration and sacrifice engendered by the war.59 Whatever the full spectrum of reasons, the cooperation was in 55 \"Adults Are Urged to Be Vaccinated,\" New York Times , May 24, 1942, 28; Adele Bernstein, \"U.S. Postwar Epidemics Foreseen,\" The Washington October 3, 1943, M12. 56 Leona Baumgartner, \"Attitude of the Na tion toward Immunization Procedures,\" American Journal of Public Health 33 (1943): 256-260. 57 Ibid. 58 Immunization Against Smallpox, Speech Given by Jame s L.

Polio, a viral infection that killed or crippled tens of thousands of Americans each year, was widely feared both for its devastating effects and because it seemed to be on the rise as ot her infectious killers faded from view.61 Unlike the diphtheria vaccine, which needed a publicity campaign to ensure its uptake, the polio vaccine needed none\u2014at least not initially. The high-profile, far-reaching fundraising efforts led by the National Foundation for Infa ntile Paralysis in the 1940s and early fifties had helped put the disease itself firmly on the national agenda and stoked American desire for a vaccine long before the first polio vaccine, developed by Jonas Salk, became 60 For examples of such episodes of resistance, s ee Colgrove, \"\"Science in a Democracy\": The Contested Status of Vaccination in the Progre ssive Era and the 1920s.\"; Leavitt, The Healthiest City: Milwaukee and the Politics of Health Reform , 76-121. 61 Polio was both less common and less commonly deadly prior to 1900 when, paradoxically, improvements in sanitation left middle and upper class children more vulnerable to the disease; poor children, by contrast, often obtained immunity by being exposed early in childhood. Even in the late 1930s, levels of the disease were low compared with wh at they would reach by the 1950s.

It also established a foothold for federal health officials, who would later use the c ountry's experience with polio vaccination to argue for growing federal involv ement in vaccination promotion.65 But the act was no easy political victory. A bitter dispute over national health insurance during the Truman administration had swung the nation to vote a Republican into the White House in 1952. An albeit moderate conservative, Eisenhower expressed little to lerance for federal 62For accounts of the Salk and Sabin vaccine trials an d the activities of the NFIP, see for example Jane S.

While the Republican-controll ed House favored limiting distribution of the vaccine to needy children, the Democratic Senate wanted to make the shots available to all children. The partisan dispute among lawmakers made headlin es, drew charges of socialism, and at one point forced Hous e Speaker Sam Rayburn to demand legislators take a \"cooling-off\" recess.67 The compromise bill, ultimately signed into law by Eisenhower in August 1955, allotted $30 million for states to vaccinate children under 20 and pregnant women\u2014as they saw fit.68 As the final bill was being hammered out and upon its approval, the press made much of th e fact that although a federally devised formula was being used to determine how mu ch vaccine each state received, ultimately the authority remained with each state, a nd not the federal government, to decide who would get the shots and where, whether in pub lic clinics or in private doctors' offices.69 The message was clear: the vaccine act should not be mistaken for socialized medicine. Congress's vaccine distribution scuffle wa s par for the course in a time when Cold War sentiment prompted most Americans to recoil at any whiff of communism. But despite such widespread sentiment, the polio scare would strengthen federal authority in health matters in another way, as well; namely, by amplifying the power and prestige of the nation's Communicable Disease Center.

Its focus, communicable diseases of th e tropical and zoonotic variety, seemed of declining import in an era of rising cancer a nd heart disease rates. In the early 1950s, the agency thus played only a minor role in the te sting of Salk's polio vaccine, which was led by the NFIP. But when a faulty lot of vaccine began causing cases of paralytic polio and even deaths in late April 1955, the CDC stepped in to play a crucial role in stemming the outbreak and maintaining confidence in the vaccine. 70 The agency's response to the scare (and to the Asian flu epidemic that followed) solidified its reputation as an authority on the prevention of communicab le diseases generally.71 Less than two weeks after the Salk vaccine had been approved and licensed for use in early April 1955, government officials began to receive reports of cases of paralytic polio in children who had recently been inoculated against the disease.72 On receiving word of the very first case, the CDC dispatched an officer in its still-new Epidemic Intelligence Service, which had b een founded in 1950 as a bulwark against the Cold War threat of biological warfare. By the time health of ficials received word of the fifth case, it was apparent that all of the affected children had received vaccine manufactured by the Berkeley, California-b ased Cutter Laboratory. Vaccine clinics throughout California were canceled, and Surg eon General Leonard Scheele asked Cutter 70 Elizabeth W. Etheridge, Sentinel for Health (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992), 74-76. 71 Ibid. 72 Paul Offit, The Cutter Incident: How America's First Polio Vaccine Led to the Growing Vaccine Crisis (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005), 83-84. 50 to recall all vaccine. He then assured Ameri cans that the cause of the outbreak would be identified, and the safety of the nation's remaining stocks of vaccines secured, by a new polio surveillance program led by the CDC. Over the next six weeks, CDC officials collected detailed data on cases of polio across the country; by the end of May, the outbreak had been definitively traced to live virus that had contaminated vaccine manufactured at the Cutter plant. 73 With the new surveillance system in place, the CDC went on to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of vaccine by anal yzing data from 8.5 million vaccinated and unvaccinated children\u2014far more than had b een included in the NFIP's previously unprecedentedly large trials of the vaccine. By the end of summer, CDC scientists confirmed that the Salk vaccine was both safe and remarkably effective. When Alexander Langmuir, head of the CDC's epidemiol ogy division, announced in November that, according to surveillance data, the nation would be spared a polio epidemic in 1956, the agency shared in the glory of the successes wrought by Salk's vaccine. A year later, CDC's data proved that the vaccine was 75 pe rcent effective against polio, even when children had received only one of the th ree recommended shots. The results, said Langmuir at Congressional hearings, \"exceeded expectancy on the basis of our previous knowledge, and [give] us a great sense of assu rance that with the large supply of vaccine 73 On the CDC's role in the so-called Cutter incident, see Etheridge, Sentinel for Health , 67-80. For an in- depth analysis of the episode, see Offit, The Cutter Incident: How America's First Polio Vaccine Led to the Growing Vaccine Crisis .

At House hearings to extend the polio vaccination act through 1957, Langmuir and Surgeon General Scheele were asked to give the asse mbled representatives an idea as to when polio vaccine programming would conclude. Langmuir responded by pointing out that even after 150 years, smallpox vaccination\u2014a nd research to improve upon it\u2014were still necessary to prevent epidemics from returning. 76 The remark provided insight into a still- nascent political agenda bei ng crafted in Washington and Atlanta: short of disease eradication, vaccination was an ongoing enterprise. Policies, therefore, had to support either one route or the other. The Vaccination Assistance Act of 1962 The CDC's hope for expanded federal support for immunization was fulfilled in October 1962, when President John F. Kennedy unceremoniously signed the Vaccination Assistance Act into law.

By 1962, the tail end of the ba by boom years, close to 40 percent of the nation's population was under 20. 80 This large stratum of the population, key to the 77 John F.

Polio wa s still a feared diseas e, even though, thanks to the widespread administration of the Sa lk polio vaccine, cases had fallen from over 30,000 in 1955 to less than 900 cases in 1961.84 The NFIP had spent the late 1950s reminding Americans that polio wasn't \"licked yet,\" and when a series of new, orally administered vaccines that protected against all three types of polio virus, developed by Albert Sabin, became available in 1961 and 1962, Americans turned out in droves once again to get immunized. On \"Sabin Sunda ys\" held across the U.S. in 1962 and 1963, 85 to 95 percent of the resident s in rural counties, small towns, and even cities took the 81 John F.

That year, smallpox returned to the U.S. for the first time in well over a decade when an infected boy, traveling with his family fr om Brazil to Canada, landed in New York's Idlewild airport, rode in a taxi, and hopped on board a trai n in Grand Central Station. Media outlets reported on CDC officials' e fforts to track down anyone who had come in contact with the boy and place them in quara ntine; they also traced CDC scientists' repeated efforts when smallpox broke out aboa rd an ocean liner from Naples, Italy that dropped off passengers in Washi ngton, D.C. later that year.86 In 1962 and 1963, health departments across the country reminded citizens of the importance of vaccination in an era when \"rapid international travel\" coul d reintroduce smallpox to the country at any time from foreign ports.87 85 For figures on vaccination coverage rates in 1962 and 1963, see Memo from Albert Sabin to William Seidman, August 16, 1976, Folder: CDC Liability Proposal, Box 8, Swine Flu Immunization Program Files, Record Group 442, Centers for Disease Control, National Archives and Records Administration, Southeast Region.

By then, about 8,000 children a year still suffered from pertussis, or whooping cough.88 But cases of diphtheria and tetanus (preventable with a combined vaccine available since 1947) had dropped to a few hundred each; none of the three was the subj ect of high profile campaigns or even occasional media coverage; in fact, the three in fections received only the rarest mentions in the press.89 The Vaccination Assistance Act, too, was hardly considered newsworthy. The program's initial announcement was overshadowed by the president's plan for health insurance for the elderly. When the vaccine act was signed into law eight months later, the Cuban Missile Crisis monopolized head lines and broadcasts, crowding out any mention of the new immunization agenda. Objections to the Vaccination Assistance Act were few and far between in 1962, a time when faith in science and government ha d not yet tumbled from its post-war apex. Protestations came from some religious gr oups, including Christ ian Scientists, who eschewed medical interventions on princi ple and saw in the act an unprecedented expansion of mandatory \"mass medication.\" 90 (This charge ignored the fact that the law specifically did not authorize states to require vaccination of people who objected to the 88 News Roundup, \"Kennedy Calls for 'Mass Immuni zation' against Diseases; No Details Supplied.\" 89 Disease incidence figures are taken from Fact Book Relating to the Vaccination Assistance Act of 1962. A search of 17 different newspapers, including the Atlanta Constitution , Chicago Tribune , and Pittsburgh Courier , turned up just 10 articles that mentioned either tetanus, diphtheria, or whopping cough in 1962; in 1963, the same search turned up just 4 mentions of these three diseases. 90 Editorial, \"Two Kinds of Immunity,\" Christian Science Monitor , May 12, 1962, 16; Editorial, \"Health Insurance, Plus Mass Inoculations,\" Christian Science Monitor , February 28, 1962, 14; Editorial, \"A Subsidy for Medical Compulsions,\" Christian Science Monitor , March 10, 1962, 16. 56 practice.) Political objections were also voiced: a group calling its elf the Commission on Constitutional Government bemoaned the law' s \"encroachment upon responsibilities that rightfully should be shouldered by the stat es, the localities, an d by private volunteer efforts.\"91 A few individuals sent letters to the pr esident saying that in a \"free country\" such as the United States, health decisions such as vaccination should be a \"personal matter.\"92 These objections echoed the protests of Progressive Era and earlier vaccination opponents, but they were fainter still and ha d no effect on the course of federal policy.93 The Vaccination Assistance Act's critics were further troubled by a provision in the law that permitted other diseases to be a dded to the original four as vaccines against them became available. In this respect, they would prove prescient. For no sooner was the immunization program proposed than health officials predicted it would soon support the prevention of measles, whose vaccine was then just over a year from being approved for use.94 Political objections to the Act were al so not off point. The Vaccination Assistance Act did expand federal involvement in immuni zation efforts beyond the level set by the polio vaccination act. It also established a leadership role fo r the Public Health Service, and the CDC in particular, in coordina ting and overseeing nationwide immunization 91 Hugh White, \"Vaccination Act,\" Christian Science Monitor , August 2, 1962, 16. 92 Letter to the President, Leslie Gampp, Laura Oard, et al., June 16, 1962, Folder LE/HE - LE/HE 6, Box 481, White House Central Files, John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. 93 The arguments of vaccination resisters from these earlier periods are further discussed in Chapter 5. 94 Marjorie Hunter, \"U.S. Hoping to Aid Fight on Measles,\" New York Times , March 2, 1962, 31. 57 efforts.95 Indeed, this was the administration's ob jective; the bill's purpose, according to Kennedy's Health, Education, and Welfare Secr etary Abraham Ribicoff, was to \"provide Federal leadership in assuring that these medi cal discoveries [vaccines] will be so utilized as to achieve the maximum benefits and protection to the public.\"96 The bill's Senate sponsor, Lister Hill, was less circumspect in justifying the Act, which, in his telling, would serve national defense and the ec onomy. For although the Act emphasized the immunization of preschoolers, it also provided for the immuni zation of all Americans. It would thus protect the populat ion against outbreaks of dipht heria in times of war or tetanus in the event of a nucle ar attack, he argued; it would also preserve \"the productive capacity of individuals who are now handicapped as a result of these diseases.\"97 Ribicoff's assertion\u2014that federal involve ment was necessary to ensure that vaccines were used by the public\u2014came directly from the nation's recent experience with polio. For although polio vaccine drives had succeeded in dramatically driving down rates of the disease, outbreaks still occurre d. And the CDC surveillance studies that began as a result of the federal government's polio vaccination act revealed why. Vaccine drives had failed to reach two groups, they found: chil dren under five, and people of all ages in the \"lower socioeconomic segments of the population.\" The pattern was well demonstrated by a CDC study of major polio epidemics that occurred in Des Moines, 95 Other scholars have made this same point. See Vivier, National Policies for Childhood Immunization in the United States: An Historical Perspective ; Colgrove, State of Immunity: The Politics of Vaccination in Twentieth-Century America , 144-147. 96 Vaccination Assistance Act of 1962, Senate Report Submitted by Mr. Hill, to Accompany H.R. 10541, August 22, 1962, 87th Congress, 2nd Session, Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office. 97 Ibid., 2. 58 Iowa and Kansas City, Missouri in 1959. In both cities, the scien tists reported, polio attack rates were tw enty to thirty times higher in \"Negroes and the poorer white residents\" than among the citi es' \"upper white\" populations.98 Attack rates were also highest among children under five, when in pr evious (pre-vaccine) epidemics in the same two cities, children aged 5 to 9 had expe rienced more polio than any other group.99 The \"pattern of incomplete protection\" creat ed by these groups constituted an \"epidemic hazard\" in communities across the count ry, Ribicoff noted. Without government leadership, he went on, there would be no gua rantee that the newly born or the hard-to- reach would be vaccinated each year, and the hazards posed by the unimmunized would never be overcome. 100 The Vaccination Assistance Act of 1962 was thus informed by the nation's experience with polio, buttressed by findings from epidemiological investigations, and validated by concerns for national secu rity and economic productivity. Unlike its legislative predecessor (the polio vaccin e act of 1955), the 1962 law represented a proactive effort to establish ongoing federal l eadership for local, state, and municipal vaccination decisions.101 With its passage, the CDC began to provide not only money, but 98 In this way, the scientific activities of the CDC re flected and reaffirmed preconceived notions about the origins of infection and disease in a society. This tendency is furthe r explored through the example of mumps and hepatitis B in later chapters.

But the AAP's recommendations were limited to the private pediatric care setting; the armed forces concerned itself with only the need s of its troops; and AP HA's recommendations were issued only every five years, thus fa iling to keep pace with the \"rapidly changing field\" of vaccine development.103 With the formation of ACIP, the U.S. had, for the first time, a singular, governmental authority a dvising the nation's health and medical professionals on who should be vacc inated against what and when. Vaccination and Disease Eradication Both the ACIP and the federal immuni zation grant program established by the VAA remain in place to this day; decades after its formation, CDC officials would 102 Ibid., 514. 103 Meeting Minutes, Meeting No. 1 of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, May 25 - 26, 1964, Folder: Info 3 ACIP Immunization 1964-5, Box 334062 No. 2, Record Group 442, Centers for Disease Control, National Archives and Records Administration, Southeast Region. 60 continue to refer to the grant program es tablished by the VAA (often referred to as \"Section 317\") as \"one of the most succe ssful prevention programs in public health.\"104 States still retained the sovereignty to launch immunization campaigns and purchase and distribute vaccine as they saw fit, but fr om 1963 on, they would increasingly do so with federal advice and resources. Private physicians, too, had to be reached with such advice, which is what brought CDC chief James Goddard before the Amer ican Medical Association in 1963. His comments, quoted in brief at the beginning of this chapter, refl ected the state of vaccination politics (wit h a lowercase \"p\") in the early 1960s. Immunizations, along with surveillance and quarantine, were part of a multipronged approach to infectious disease control, Goddard said; vaccines alone had never eradicated a di sease, he noted, and in the case of smallpox, improvements in environmenta l conditions and standa rd of living were crucial to the disease's disappearance. But changing times meant that vaccines were becoming increasingly important as a mean s of protecting all Americans\u2014not just children\u2014against these sometimes forgotte n diseases. For nothing but immunization would have guaranteed New Yorkers protecti on from the smallpox imported by the boy from Brazil, he said. And not hing but vaccines would protect the wives and mothers who now\u2014\"with the shifting patterns of society\"\u2014accompanied their families on camping and fishing trips, for example, where the ri sk of tetanus was ubiquitous. Goddard also 104 The Vaccination Assistance Act comprised Section 31 7 of the 1944 Public Hea lth Service Act, which consolidated laws relating to the Public Health Se rvice and established a framework for coordination of federal and state public health activities.

The CDC would advise, conduct surveillance, respond to outbreaks, and maintain the expertise to confirm diagnosis of infections , like smallpox, that were seen less and less often in doctors' offices. Organized medici ne, meanwhile, needed to convince as many patients to take the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines as had shown up for polio vaccine on Sabin Sundays.105 But doctors sometimes questioned the wisdom of mass vaccination. In 1965, one physician inquired whether a revision of sm allpox vaccination practices was in order, considering the rarity of the di sease in the U.S. against the vaccine's risks. (The vaccine caused one death in every million shots and an undefined number of cases of encephalitis, or swelling of th e brain). The CDC's Donald He nderson replied that even if smallpox vaccination were halted in the U.S., members of the military, medical practitioners and travelers\u2014a \"very large\" number of people\u2014would still need to be vaccinated because of the presence of small pox abroad. And given that adults appeared likelier than children to suffe r vaccine-related complications, he added, mass vaccination of children continued to make sense. 106 The circumstances dictating Henderson' s response, however, were about to change. Even as Goddard, speaking in 1963, e xpressed ambivalence about the power of vaccines alone to eradicate disease, the Worl d Health Assembly had pledged its support 105 Immunization Against Smallpox, Speech Given by Jame s L. Goddard before the Clinical Meeting of the American Medical Association. 106 General Commentary Regarding Smallpox Vaccinatio n, November 1965, Folder: Info 3 ACIP Imm 1964-5, Box 334062 No. 2, Record Group 442, Centers for Disease Control, National Archives and Records Administration, Southeast Region. 62 for a push to vaccinate 80 percent of the earth's population against smallpox.107 In 1966, the assembly formally adopted a resolution to eliminate the disease, and the CDC donated experts, equipments, and vaccine to the World Health Organization, which led the eradication program.108 In fact, it was the existence of th e WHO (created as an agency of the newly formed United Nations after World War II), and a series of technological developments (including the jet injector and freeze-drying techniques) that were credited with finally making eradication worth an attempt. 109 A diplomatic plea from the Soviet minister of health also pl ayed a role; as in the U.S., he noted, smallpox had been eliminated within the U.S.S.R.'s borders, but the disease's presence in other countries posed a perpetual threat of imported outbreaks.110 A few years into the program, containment of the disease in poor, populous countries with high rates of smallpox demonstrated that the disease could be er adicated even \"under the most difficult conditions expected.\"111 The U.S.'s commitment to smallpox eradication abroad was mirrored by a campaign to eradicate measles at home, announced officially by President Lyndon B. 107 Hopkins, The Greatest Killer: Smallpox in History , 304. 108 Horace G. Ogden, CDC and the Smallpox Crusade (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1987), 7-21. 109 Smallpox Eradication and Measles Control in Africa, Brochure Published by the National Communicable Disease Center and the Ag ency for Internati onal Development. 110 Hopkins, The Greatest Killer: in History , 302-303; Ian Glynn and Jenifer Glynn, The Life and Death of Smallpox (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 195-196. 111 Hopkins, The Greatest Killer: Smallpox in History , 305.

It was a disease of \"only mild severity,\" which caused \"infrequent complications\" and only rarely caused deat hs, noted Langmuir and CDC head David Sencer, in a presentation before the memb ership of the American Public Health Association.113 Over the last half century, they went on, \"man\" had developed a \"deep respect for the biological balance of th e human race with measles virus\"\u2014but this accepted doctrine, they argued, was ready to be overturned. In the plans they laid out, there were now three bases for the diseas e's eradication: an etiological one, a technological one, and an epidemiological one. The measles virus had been isolated and studied, and, like smallpox viru s, was now known to infect only humans, creating neither chronic carriers (as diphtheria could) nor \"inapparent\" infe ctions (as polio sometimes did). The isolation of the measles virus, furthe rmore, had led to several \"potent\" vaccines. Finally, epidemiological studies of the disease had demonstr ated both how it spread and how many \"susceptibles\" were needed to sust ain an outbreak. As with smallpox, it was clear that the disease could be eliminated with less than 100 percent vaccination coverage. Based on this statisti cal knowledge, the CDC official s confidently declared that 112 Measles Eradication 1967, Supplement to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, April 15, 1967, Folder: Information 3 Imm 1964-1967, Box 343357, Record Group 442, Centers for Disease Control, National Archives and Records Administration, Southeast Region.

Sencer, H. Bruce Dull, and Alexander Langmuir, \"Epidemiologic Basis for Eradication of Measles in 1967,\" Public Health Reports 82, no. 3 (1967): 253-256. 64 measles could\u2014and would\u2014be eradicated from the United States before the end of 1967.114 The decision to eradicate a \"mild\" disease largely because science possessed the means to do so speaks to the confidence in sc ience and technology that still reigned from the nation's victories against enemies both political and pathogenic in World War II . That these sentiments persisted, albeit in an e volving form, was well expressed by Boisfeuillet Jones, Kennedy's assistant secretary of Hea lth, Education, and Welfare, who noted in 1963 that the U.S. \"has the most vigorous, pr oductive, and imaginative total research effort that has ever been witnessed by the world.\" Jones went on to declare a new \"golden age\" of science, one focused on medical research and biol ogy: \"The potential consequences of advances in biology are as significant to mankind as advances in nuclear physics. There is in prospect the virtual certainty of contro l of what are now the major diseases of mankind.\"115 Such control had already proven to be within reach, as American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene president E. Harold Hinman noted. In 1965, Hinman took stock of the diseases that developed c ountries, including the U.S., had all but wiped out within their borders with the help of drugs, pesticid es, and vaccines. The list was long: typhoid fever, tuberculosis, diphth eria, smallpox, whooping cough, typhus, cholera, 114 Historian Elizabeth Etheridge also notes that wh en the Vaccination Assistance Act was renewed in 1965, federal funds became available expressly for measles vaccination; \"Thus, a disease previously given little thought worked its way to the top of the health agenda.\" Etheridge, Sentinel for Health , 169. 115 Speech given by Assistant Secretar y of HEW Boisfeuillet Jones, Univer sity of Pennsylvania, April 29, 1963, Folder FA5 12-16-62 - 4-30-63 GENERAL, Box 99, White House Central Files, John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. 65 plague, malaria, and yellow fever, among others.116 Hinman's conclusion echoed that of Langmuir and Sencer in their speech befo re the APHA. Nature no longer need be perceived as something to be tolerated or \"r espected,\" but was, rather, a force to be overcome with technical breakthroughs and scie ntific expertise. In this view, disease control was a minimum expectation; eradicat ion represented the pi nnacle of scientific achievement. This prevailing sentiment toward nature goe s far in contextualiz ing the decision to eliminate a \"mild\" disease such as measles, but there were more practical reasons behind such campaigns as well. One such reason was, simply, money. As Hinman put it, when it came to managing diseases, \"Cont rol is a continuing, costly pr ocedure. Eradication is a one-time capital expenditure.\" 117 Measles, the CDC calculate d, cost a city an annual $350,000 for every million residents; vaccinating t hose residents would cost less than a third as much\u2014and the differential was even bi gger when the costs of lost income were factored in.118 A separate justification concerne d the uncertain future created by a partially vaccinated populati on: in essence, vaccination against diseases created an imperative to eradicate those diseases. Me mbers of a CDC immunization committee (not the ACIP) noted that because the research community was uncertain about how long the \"artificial immunity\" created by vaccines woul d last, it was possible that vaccination of children was creating a situation in whic h, \"in the not too distant future, many 116 E. Harold Hinman, \"How Much Co ntrol of Communicable Diseases?,\" American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 15, no. 2 (1966): 125-134. 117 Ibid. 118 Measles Eradication 1967, Supplement to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. 66 adults...may become once again susceptible to su ch diseases as diphthe ria, pertussis, and measles.\"119 The notion prompted the committee members to remark on the \"sensitive balance of nature\"\u2014and to conclude that th e only answer to the potential dilemma was to immunize early and repeatedly, until na ture had effectively been conquered. Reframing Measles Such justifications held sway within th e profession, but the public was given a very different set of reasons why measles needed to be erad icated in 1967: namely, that measles was a serious disease with horrific and sometimes fatal complications. The CDC's campaign\u2014designed to reach 8 to 10 million children in need of measles vaccination\u2014produced radio and television spot s, billboard ads, films, comic strips, coloring books, and more with the message th at measles was an insidious threat. Radio and television stations across the country aired public service announcements notifying the public that \"measles is a serious diseas e that sometimes causes pneumonia, deafness, encephalitis and even death.\" 120 Personalities from the Surgeon General to Ann Landers spread the same message, emphasizing that m easles could leave children blind, deaf, and mentally impaired.121 \"There is no excuse for needlessl y prolonging the fight against this 119 Immunization: Theory and Practice, Report by V.F.

But they weren't quick to see it th at way, and neit her were all health professionals. The disconnect between measles' public image and its private one was addressed in a memo that Goddard sent to rally immunization personnel around the country to the cause. \"Measles has not suddenl y become a more seri ous disease. It has always been a scourge of childhood,\" Goddard wrote. \"It commands special attention now because modern medical research has pr ovided us with vaccines which can prevent 126 Trudy Stamm, \"Kim Aids Measles Drive,\" Children Limited 15, no. 5 (1966): 1.

In Delaware's anti-m easles campaign, the message \"that measles can be a dangerous disease with widespr ead complications was met by general public apathy,\" noted a state health officer. \"Measles, unlike poliomyelitis, is not a \"glamorous\" disease....It was found that for the most part the public still considered it a minor, childhood disease.\"130 Officials in Washington and Atlanta may have been eager for a new era of vaccination to begin, but the suppor t they needed from health professionals and the public was only halfhearted, at best. Measles was not eradicated in 1967.131 But an internal report published by the CDC late that year stated th at cases and deaths had mark edly declined and\u2014as a bonus\u2014 reporting of measles cases and outbreaks had gr eatly improved. As a result, a new picture of measles began to form: measles complications, once considered rare, now seemed common. Deaths, thought to occu r in one of every 100,000 cases, now seemed to occur in one of every 10,000 cases. 132 Indeed, the calculated representation of measles as a dangerous infection began to seem like a self-fulfilling prophec y. The measles vaccine became possible only with increased knowledge of the disease; with deployment of the vaccine (combined with disease surveillan ce) came even more knowledge about the disease and its dangers, which ultimately validated the impression that public health 129 Memo to Vaccination Assistance Program Field Pe rsonnel from Immunization Activities Office, CDC. 130 Edward F.

Within a decade, measles would no longer be referred to as a mi nor or mild disease, either by lay observers or health and medical professionals. And its vaccine would come to be widely accepted as a routine part of childhood health care. Vaccinating Children The measles eradication campaign, whic h was supported by a 1965 renewal of the Vaccination Assistance Act, focused on the vaccin ation of children. The original intent of the Act, however, was to encourage the vacc ination of both children and adults, namely preschool children and low-income adults. Me asles, like diphtheria and pertussis, was clearly a childhood disease. Smallpox and tetanus were not exclusively childhood infections, and nor was polio, as the sloga n of the NFIP's early 1960s vaccination promotion campaign\u2014Babies and Breadwinners\u2014be lied. That stated intent of the VAA, and the fact that the NFIP shifted the focus of its publicity efforts in the early sixties, reveals that the diverse community of prof essionals involved in the promotion and application of vaccination was still grappling, halfway through the century, with a rather fundamental question: who were vaccines for? The NFIP's polio campaigns did much to imprint the notion that vaccines were for children firmly onto the American psyche. Certainly, school-age children were most at risk of polio, but they were not exclusively at risk, as once starkly evidenced by former President Roosevelt's paralytic polio. Noneth eless, the images of poster children, Polio Pioneers, and, later, the rationing of limited polio vaccine to 5 to 9 year olds highlighted this group's risk to the exte nt that vaccination as a servi ce for adults was increasingly 71 overlooked. But the nation's experience with pol io wasn't the only f actor driving home the impression that vaccination was for childr en; it had much to do with the rise of pediatric care, as well. Although pediatrics first began to emerge as a category of care in the late nineteenth century, it did not become firmly established as a medical specialty until the 1930s. Pediatrics in this period became ch aracterized by regular, repeated medical examinations of healthy children. Children were x-rayed, weighed, and measured, and their blood and urine were tested, all in an e ffort to ensure their \"normal\" development and keep them free of illness and disease.133 Such preventive pediatrics was initially designed for the working class, as so ciologist Sydney Haplern has noted.134 And although well-child care did initially take place in he alth centers supported by the U.S. Children's Bureau (created in 1912) , and clinics supported by the Sh eppard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Act (passed in 1921), by the 1940s th is had changed. The professionalization of pediatrics, which followed the professionali zation of medicine ge nerally, had largely moved well-child care from public settings into private offices, making it increasingly the domain of the middle class. That preventive pediatrics was initially r ooted in public institutions in the early decades of the twentieth century also speaks to the fact that the field emerged, according to Halpern, in response to a broad social m ovement focused on child health and welfare. The rise of pediatrics was also, she notes, pa rt of a \"more general trend toward new forms 133 Jeffrey Brosco, \"Weight Charts an d Well-Child Care: How the Pediatri cian Became the Expert in Child Health,\" Archives of Pediatric Adolescent Medicine 155, no. 12 (2001): 1385-1389. 134 Halpern, American Pediatrics: The Social Dynamics of Professionalism, 1880-1980 , 32. 72 of societal regulation of children.\"135 The products of this movement, the roots of which (like pediatrics) reached back to the late nineteenth century, included the Children's Bureau and Sheppard-Towner Act, as well as laws governing compulsory schooling for children, child labor, and delinquency reform, among others. Indeed, the first decades of the twentieth century, dubbed the \"Century of the Child\" by reformers, were characterized by increasing federal involvement in children's lives.136 Though such federal activities came in res ponse to a broad social moveme nt, they also reflected the belief\u2014also held by Progressive activists\u2014that the welfare of children ensured a strong future for the state. Pediatricians' struggle to establish the sovereignty of their profession overlapped with the tense convergence of public health and medici ne generally. In the 1930s, pediatricians themselves increasingly saw v accination as an integral component of the preventive pediatric care they offered, as revealed by San Francisco pediatrician Dr. Thelander's comments (quoted on page 37). But if vaccination was a predominantly public good in the first decades of the centu ry, and a predominantly private good in the decades that followed, it became, at mid-centu ry, a shared responsibility of both public health and medicine\u2014or more accurately, pe diatrics. After the demise of Sheppard- Towner and the Children's Bureau, pediatrician s' offices became th e most logical setting for vaccination; a series of shots followed by boosters could be easily administered at the 135 Ibid., 14. 136 Joseph M. Hawes and N. Ray Hiner, American Childhood: A Research Guide and Historical Handbook (Westport: Greenwood Press, 1985), 491; Jo seph M. Hawes and N. Ray Hiner, eds., Children in Historical and Comparative Perspective (Westport: Greenwood Press,1991); Hugh Cunningham, Children and Childhood in Western Society since 1500 (New York: Longman Group Publishing, 1995), 163. 73 same time as a child's regular barrage of tests and measuremen ts. And indeed, this compilation of services would b ecome mutually reinforcing. Pediatric care offered a convenient setting, a set of professionals eager to own the practice of vaccination, and a captive audience that was increasingly targeted as a source of epidemics in communities. Turn-of-th e-century increases in immigration and urbanization had led social reformers to push for compulsory schooling; compulsory schooling, in turn, led to increasingly crowded schools. In the 1900s and 1910s, Progressive reformers made school s the site of compulsory me dical examinations to test hearing, vision, and dental health. Schools provided an expedient means of reaching children, but they also, vexingly, provided an expedient means of spreading contagious disease. People \"cannot imagine the variety of perplexing situations that arise in connection with attempts to el iminate contagious disease from school children,\" said the Des Moines, Iowa schools medical director in 1930.137 Every case of an infectious disease put boards of education up in arms, he noted: \"Now what shall we do? Should the children be vaccinated? Should the building be fumigated? Should school be closed temporarily?\"138 Answers to such questions would come from the CDC, whose Epidemiologic Intelligence Service dispatched more and more epidemiologists to identify the sources of community outbreaks across the country. The EIS's objective was disease control; the means it employed was to identify the origin s of epidemics. In the postwar baby-boom years, they responded to requests from school s and institutions for help managing the 137 Moore, \"Responsibilities of the Medical Professi on in Health Program of Public Schools.\" 138 Ibid., 1109. 74 spread of communicable diseases. Their finding s provided scientific proof that children's school attendance helped disseminate infections throughout communities. A 1962 diphtheria outbreak in Sioux City, for example, was traced to a 6-year-old girl who alone passed the infection to five siblings, four ne ighbors, and 36 classmates, all of them either unimmunized or insufficiently immunized agai nst the disease. But when looking for the source of the 6-year-old's in fection, the investigators were stumped. The city lacked a \"true skid-row section,\" they noted, and ther e were no \"districts catering to transients nearby.\"139 The notion that poverty spr ead disease was an old one; it was also one that was buttressed by the findings of the CDC' s polio surveillance during the 1950s, and whose persistence is evident in this investig ation and others from the 1960s. \"Transients\" and other low-income groups, as polio surv eillance showed, made notoriously difficult vaccination targets. But children were eas y ones, and epidemiology was proving their critical role in disseminating disease. After all, said the CDC's David Sencer during the measles eradication campaign, \"if measles is n't in the schools, it can't be home.\"140 Measles campaign-era activities thus prov ided an ever-more conclusive answer to the question of who vaccines were for. They were for children\u2014though at what age remained up for debate in the decades to come. Conclusion 139 T.E. Corothers and Gabriel S. Zatlin, \"An Outbr eak of Diphtheria: A Story of Investigation and Control,\" Clinical Pediatrics 5, no. 1 (1966): 29-33. 140 Anonymous, \"End to Measles Possible, Says MD,\" AMA News , October 31, 1966. 75 The Vaccination Assistance Act made vaccines available to private physicians, but only after a community's need for free vaccination was met.141 In this way, the Act aligned with the progressive agenda for which the Kennedy administration became known; it also aligned with the administration's focus on youth. The vaccination act joined other social policies that originated in the White House to support youth physical fitness, education, and employment. For th e administration saw the condition of the nation's youth as the measure of the stat e's future strength: \"If our young men and women are to attain the social, scientific a nd economic goals of which they are capable,\" noted Kennedy in 1963, \"they must all posse ss the strength, the energy and the good health to pursue them vigorously.\" 142 As in an earlier era marked by progressive politics, the interests of state and children we re equated as one and the same. On announcing the Vaccination Assistance Ac t, Kennedy also remarked that there \"was no longer any reason\" why American ch ildren should have to suffer from polio, diphtheria, whooping cough or tetanus. The act was meant to equalize access to health services across social strata, but vaccination served other purposes as well. As Kennedy's comment reveals, in the \"golden age\" of medici ne, these infections should be regarded as unnecessary inconveniences; vaccines had made it so. In this respect, vaccines supported productive, prosperous, convenient American lifes tyles. They safeguarded the family that camped together, protected the working mother's time, shielded the overseas traveler, and protected the children in bur geoning schools. Furthermore, they were a product of 141 Fact Book Relating to the Vaccination Assistance Act of 1962. 142 John F. Kennedy, Special Message to the Congress on the Nation's Youth. 76 American research efforts, and were theref ore the province of every American. And they saved money to boot. The federal government under Kennedy thus outlined a clear set of reasons why it was in the state's interest to maintain au thority over the ques tion of who should be vaccinated against what, and when. The authority they consolidated through their actions represented the culmination of decades of e xpansion of federal activity in the realm of vaccination. It also built on changes in the provision of medical care to children, developments in epidemiology, and popular attitudes toward science and technology. Though the Vaccination Assistance Act would e xpire before the 1970s, federal authority over vaccination would not. For the agenda of mass vaccination on a national scale to be accomplished, however, lay Americans would have to be convinced that vaccination against all preventable diseases\u2014not just the dreaded ones\u2014was worth pursuing. In the 1970s, as the next two chapters demonstrat e, this would be accomplished through new policies, as well as the re-framing of vaccine-preventable diseases. 77 Chapter 2 \"How Serious Is Mumps?\" Vaccination and the Framing of a Childhood Disease When the live virus mumps vaccine was first licensed for use early in 1968, it met with only mild interest from the publ ic, followed at times by confusion.1 Popular press coverage presented uneven portrayals of the infection's gravity and offered conflicting reports on who should get the mumps vaccine an d when they should get it. When Science Service reporter Faye Marley wrote up her investigation of why the mumps vaccine was so little used well over a y ear after its introduction, sh e opened her piece by asking a question on many parents' minds: \"How serious is mumps?\" The answer she dug up: \"It depends on how your doctor views it.\"2 In sharp contrast to, say, polio, popular consensus on the threat posed by mumps was lacking. And the reason why so many went without mumps vaccine, concluded Marley, was because doctors themselves didn't agree on whether or when to give it. Some wanted to give it to a ll children, some just to boys, ot hers only to males at puberty and after. Still others saw little need for the v accine at all, noting that nearly one-third of mumps cases produced no symptoms but nonetheless conferred lasting immunity. Within a decade, however, the notion that all children should be protected against mumps early in life came to prevail among both doctors and public health professionals. During the same period, mumps gradually but firmly acquired a new public image, one 1 The live virus mumps vaccine, first li censed in 1968, will be referred to simply as the mumps vaccine or Mumpsvax from here forward. 2 Faye Marley, \"Vaccine for Mumps Not Widely Used,\" Los Angeles Times , May 30, 1969, B4. 78 that downplayed the frequency of its mild a nd invisible cases in favor of emphasis on the disease's rare but serious complications. Mumps, that is, was transformed from a nuisance widely considered so harmless it was a frequent butt of jokes to an infection defined by its as-yet unquantif ied potential to harm the organs, cause deafness, and jeopardize the sterility of men. In his series of essays on the framing of disease, historian Charles Rosenberg has argued that a society's explanations of di sease are necessarily dependent on \"time-bound intellectual tools,\" and that even the most \"t echnical aspects\" of a disease, its causation, and possible modes of prevention \"exist in bo th social and intellectual space.\" How a disease is perceived at a given moment in time thus reflects contemporary scientific knowledge as well as popular values, cultural preoccupations, political priorities, and the like.3 Beginning in the late 1960s, the mumps vaccine refashioned the intellectual tools with which health experts and society at la rge made sense of the disease. This is significant because the manner in which mump s was framed after 1968 was crucial to the vaccine's acceptance in the growing arsenal of childhood immunizations that would become universally mandated by the end of the 1970s. Precisely how and why mumps was effectively reframed in this period shed s light on the pivotal but overlooked role that vaccines have played in shaping popular and professional perceptions of disease.4 3 See Rosenberg, \"Framing Disease: Illn ess, Society, and History,\" xvii. 4 This analysis is influenced by Rosenberg's theoretical work on the framing of disease. See for example Rosenberg, \"Disease in History: Fram es and Framers.\"; and History.\"; Rosenberg, \"What Is Disease?.\"; Charles E. Rosenberg, Explaining Epidemics and Other Studies in the History of Medicine (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992). 79 Certainly, the mumps vaccine was not sole ly responsible for altering popular and professional attitudes toward the disease; nor was the vaccine's manufacturer, Merck. Rather, the vaccine and the actions of its manuf acturer were critical in focusing attention on mumps at a time when humankind's relations hip to infectious disease generally had been transformed by the recent triumphs ag ainst smallpox globally and polio at home. The near-elimination of these dreaded diseases in the U.S. prompted some soul-searching on the part of doctors and health professiona ls regarding the appropr iate use of vaccines in this new era. Because of the timing of the mumps vaccine's approval, mumps became an important part of this dialogue; additio nally, outbreaks of the disease became an important testing ground for the application of vaccination against the so-called \"milder\" diseases, of which mumps was one. By nudging mumps into the spotlight in the late 1960s and 1970s, Merck's mumps vaccine thus played a key role in making mumps infection both a repository for and reflection of the medical, social, political, and cultural preoccupations of its day. These preoccupati ons, in turn, informed gradually shifting policies governing mumps' prevention. The reframing of mumps during the middle decades of the twentieth century is evident in representations of the illness from the period; such repr esentations, historian Sander Gilman has argued, ar e a \"paramount\" if inadequa tely examined means of probing cultural understandings of a disease and the responses to it at a particular historical moment. 5 The marked evolution in mumps repr esentations from the pre- to the post-vaccine era illuminates the many roles that vaccination has played in supporting the 5 Sander Gilman, \"Representing Health and Illness,\" Journal of Medical Humanities 32, no. 2 (2011): 69- 75. 80 perceived underpinnings of social order in America. Over time, mumps has represented a threat to U.S. military supremacy, commerce and trade, reproductive capacity, and middle-class security; at different points, mumps vaccine has been applied (or sought after) as a thwart against each of these thre ats and more. Mumps' history from the 1940s through the 1970s\u2014the subject of this chapter\u2014is thus illu strative of the political, economic, and cultural significance of vacci nes and vaccination programs generally in the twentieth century history of the U.S. A bove all, however, the story of mumps is an example of how a vaccine can reframe the wa y Americans think about a disease and the importance of its prevention. Preventing Mumps Between 1963 and 1969, several vaccines ag ainst measles, a vaccine against rubella, and a vaccine against mumps were developed and licensed in rapid succession. The deployment of the measles vaccine (as th e star of the seminal, federally sponsored eradication campaign described in the previous chapter) and the development of the rubella vaccine (which prevented birth def ects and was linked to abortion politics) both overshadowed the debut of the vaccine against mumps. 6 In fact, mumps was a disease of relatively little concern to most Americans wh en its live-virus vaccine made it to market in 1968. Its vaccine was never anxiously antici pated, nor did it become the subject of high profile campaigns, nor did it ever get caught up in scares over contamination or inherent risks. But its story is nonetheless important from an historical perspective 6 On the rubella vaccine, which is not addressed at length in this work, see Chapter 2 in Heller, The Vaccine Narrative ; Leslie J. Reagan, Dangerous Pregnancies: Mothers, Disabilities, and Abortion in America (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2010). 81 precisely because it was a vaccine against a li ttle-worried-about disease that, within a few years, was nonetheless administered to millions of American children. Popular accounts of the mumps vaccine's development often begin in 1963, when six-year-old Jeryl Lynn Hilleman came down wi th a sore throat and swollen glands. The girl's symptoms would have been unremarkab le if not for who her father was: Maurice Hilleman, head of Virus and Cell Biology at the burgeoning pharmaceutical company Merck, where his lab had just successfully de veloped the first live virus measles vaccine.7 Hilleman, a widower who found himself tendi ng to his daughter's care, was suddenly inspired to begin work on a vaccine agai nst mumps, which he began by swabbing Jeryl Lynn's throat. Jeryl Lynn's viral strain wa s isolated, cultured, and then attenuated (weakened) in Merck's labs, and after fiel d trials throughout Pe nnsylvania proved the resulting shot effective, the \"Jeryl-Lynn st rain\" vaccine against mumps, also known as Mumpsvax, was approved for use.8 This popular lore ignores the fact that H illeman was not the first to try or even succeed at developing a vaccine against mumps. Efforts to develop a mumps 7 Hilleman, credited with developing several dozen v accines (against human and animal infections) is a legendary figure in the fields of vaccine developmen t and public health. His m easles vaccine, notably, was licensed the same month his daughter came down with mumps. Hilleman's work at Merck is recounted in Galambos and Sewell, Networks of Innovation: Vaccine Devel opment Sharp & Dohme and Mulford, 1895-1995 , 79-121. A popular account of his life and scientific work is given in Paul A. Offit, Vaccinated: One Man's Quest to Defeat the World's Deadliest Diseases , 1st Smithsonian Books ed. (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Books, 2007).

Research on a mumps vaccine began in earnest during the 1940s, prompted by the U.S.'s entry into World War II. At that time, Public Health Service (PHS) researchers revisi ted data and literature on communicable infections among troops during the first world war. They noted that mumps, though not a significant cause of death, was one of the top reasons troops were sent to the infirmary and absent from duty in that war\u2014often for well over two weeks at a time. 9 Mumps had long been recognized as a common but not \"s evere\" disease of ch ildhood that typically caused fever and swelling of the salivary gla nds. But when it struck teens and adults, its usually rare complications\u2014including infl ammation of the reproductive organs and pancreas\u2014became more frequent and more tr oublesome. Because of its rapid spread through crowded barracks and training camps, and because of its tendency to inflame the testes, mumps was thus second only to vene real disease in disabling recruits. PHS researchers estimated that during World War I, mumps cost the U.S. close to 4 million 'man days' from duty, contributing to more tota l days lost from duty than foreign forces saw. 10 The problem of mumps among soldiers quickly became apparent during the second world war, too.11 But in the interim between th e two wars, the mumps virus had 9 Clara Councell, \"War and Infectious Disease,\" Public Health Reports 56, no. 12 (1941): 547-573. 10 Milton Levine, \"A Sponsored Epidemic of Mumps in a Private School,\" American Journal of Public Health 34, no. 12 (1944): 1274-1276. See also Councell, \"War and Infectious Disease.\" Flu and measles were of equal importance to mumps as causes of illne ss among troops during the first world war; measles and flu, but not mumps, were among l eading causes of death in that war. 11 A.C. McGuiness and E.A. Gall, \"Mumps at Army Camps in 1943,\" War Medicine 5 (1943): 95. 83 been identified as the cause of the disease.12 PHS surgeon Karl Habel noted that while civilians didn't have to worry about mumps, the infection was a serious problem for the armed forces, and that alone justified the search for an immunization.13 \"To the military surgeon, mumps is no passing indisposition of benign course but ranks with many of the more formidable diseases,\" confirmed two Harvard epidemiologists. 14 In the early 1940s, Harvard researchers began experimenting with promoting mumps virus immunity in Macaque monkeys. They had been tipped off to the problem of mumps by one Brigadier General F.F. Russell and funded by the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), the wartime agency created by Pres ident Roosevelt to encourage scientific research in support of national defense.15 For as long as mumps sent soldiers to the infirmary in the course of active duty, the dis ease was a threat in urgent need of an easily applied solution. Within a few years, the Harvard resear chers, led by biologist John Enders, had developed a diagnostic test us ing antigens from the monkey' s salivary glands, as well as a rudimentary vaccine.16 In a subsequent set of experiments, conducted both by the 12 C.D.

By the end of the 1940s, the Harvard group's research was being supporte d by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP), which was devoted to polio research, and no longer by OSRD.20 Enders stopped publishing on the mumps virus in 1949 a nd instead turned his full-time attention to the cultivation of polio virus.21 Habel, at the NIH, also began studying polio. Throughout the fifties, U.S. scientists on the whole devoted little time to mumps.22 With polio occupying multiple daily headlines, mumps was moved well off the nation's political and scientific agendas. Although mumps received scant resources in the 1950s, Lederle Laboratories commercialized the partially protective mumps vaccine, which was about 50 percent effective and offered about a year of protection. 23 When the American Medical Association's Council on Drugs reviewed the vaccine, they didn't see much use for it. The AMA advised against administering the s hot to children, noting that in children mumps and its \"sequelae\" were \"not se vere.\" The AMA acknowledged the vaccine's potential utility in certain populations of and adults and children\u2014namely, military 20 See for example H.

Edward Shaw, a physician at the University of California School of Medicine, argued that given the vaccine's temporary protecti on, \"deliberate exposure to the disease in childhood...may be desirable\": it was the only way to ensure lifelong immunity, he noted, and it came with few risks.25 The most significant risk, in his view, was that infected children would pass the disease to susceptible adults. But even this concern failed to move experts to urge vaccination. War had made mumps a public health priority for the U.S. government in the 1940s, but the resulting technology (imperfect as it was) generated little interest or enthusiasm in a time of peace, when other health concerns loomed larger. After the war but before the new live vi rus vaccine was introduced, mumps went back to being what it long had been: an innocuous and sometimes amusing childhood disease. The amusing nature of mumps in the 1950s is evident even in seemingly serious forums. A 1955 New York State health depa rtment brochure on mumps adopted a light tone and a comical caricature of chipmunk-ch eeked \"Billy\" to describe a brush with the disease. In Chicago, health columnist and Chicago Medical Society president Theodore Van Dellen noted that when struck with mumps, \"the victim is likely to be dubbed 24 Ibid. 25 Edward B. Shaw, \"Mumps Immunization,\" Journal of the American Medical Association 167, no. 14 (1958): 1744. 87 'moon-face.'\"26 Emblematic midcentury examples, these representations of mumps are also notable for the fact that they downplay ed the severity of the infection. Van Dellen noted that while mumps did have some unpl easant complications\u2014including the one that had garnered much attention during the war\u2014 \"the sex gland complication is not always as serious as we have been led to believe.\"27 The health department brochure pointed out that \"children seldom develop complications ,\" and should therefore not be vaccinated: \"Almost always a child is better off havi ng mumps: the case is milder in childhood and gives him life-long immunity.\"28 Such conceptualizations he lped shape popular representa tions of the illness, and indeed in the press an almost exaggera tedly lighthearted att itude toward mumps prevailed. Across the country in the 1950s, local papers reporte d on the oldest adult (age 99) to come down with mumps; the boy whose French poodle went missing when mumps prevented him from whistling to call his dog home; and the young couple who exchanged their marital vows by phone when the groom came down with mumps just before the wedding. 29 Mumps was comedy and a curiosity for readers of all stripes: the Los Angeles Times speculated on whether the word mumps wa s singular or plural; Chicagoans got a laugh over the Daily Defender 's photo of a fat-cheeked Mrs. Charlotte Meyer and her fat- 26 \"How Enlargement,\" Daily , February 26, 1950, 20. 27 Ibid. 28 \"Mumps,\" ed.

Articles speculated on that as well.31 But the top reason mumps made headlines th roughout the decade and into the 1960s was its propensity to bench professional male athl etes: track stars, baseball players, boxers, football stars, and coaches all made the news when struck by mumps.32 So did Washington Redskins player Clyde Goodnight, whose stor y revealed the paradox of mumps at midcentury. Goodnight's coaches giddily planned to announce his mumps infection to the press and then send him in to the field to play anyway, where the Pittsburgh Steelers, they gambled, would be sure to leave him open for passes. But the plan was nixed before game-time by the Re dskins' P.R. department, who feared the jubilant Goodnight might run up in the stands after a good play and give fans the mumps. Noted one of the team's publicis ts: \"That's not good business.\"33 Mumps was widely regarded with casual dismissal and a smirk, that is, even as large enterprises worried about the infection's potentia l to cut into profits. When Baltimore Orioles outfielder Fra nk Robinson came down with the mumps in 1968 during an away game against the Los Angeles Angels, however, the tone of the team's response was markedly different. Me rck's new Mumpsvax vaccine was recently 30 Frank Colby, \"Take My Word for It,\" Los Angeles Times , June 2, 1950, A5; UPI, \"It Only Hurts When We Swallow,\" Daily Defender , December 31, 1963, 4. 31 Associated Press, \"Tony, the Boxer,\" Chicago Daily Tribune , March 25, 1957, C10. 32 See for example \"World of Sports,\" The Washington Post and Times Herald , February 14, 1958, D3; Associated Press, \"VPI Tackle Richards Sidelined with Mumps,\" The Washington Post and Times Herald , August 30, 1955, 15; Associated Press, \"Mumps Bench Ram Star,\" Chicago Daily Tribune , December 21, 1955, B1; UPI, \"Albert Has Mumps,\" Los Angeles Times , July 13, 1958, C2. 33 Anonymous, \"Redskin Takes His Mumps,\" The Washington Post , September 28, 1950, 12. 89 licensed for sale, and the team's management moved quickly to vaccinate not just the players, but also their entire press corps and club officials.34 The Orioles' use of the new vaccine adhered to the guidelines Surg eon General William Stewart had announced upon the vaccine's approval: it was for pre-teens, teenagers, and adults who hadn't yet had a case of the mumps.35 For the time being, at least, it wasn't recommended for children. Despite their apparent odds of having come into contact with mumps in the field, however, the Angels decided not to vaccinate their own player s. Indeed, baseball's lack of consensus on how or whether to use the vaccine was symptomatic of the nation's response as a whole. The cultural ambivalence toward mumps on display in the 1950s and 60s had translated into an ambivalence toward the disease's new prophylactic. The nation's reception of the shot was well-captured in the 1968 hit movie Bullitt . In the opening scene, as San Francisco cop Frank Bullitt r eadied himself for the work day ahead, his partner Don Delgetti reached for the day's pa per and began reading th e top stories aloud: \"Mumps vaccine on the market...the government authorized yesterday what officials term the first clearly effective vaccine to prev ent mumps\u2014\" \"Shut up, Delgetti\" Bullitt cut him off, \"and have your orange juice.\" 36 Clearly, Bullitt had more important things to worry about than the mumps. So did the rest of the country: the Los Angeles Times 34 UPI, \"Mumps Hits F. Robinson,\" Daily Defender , April 23, 1968, 24. 35 UPI, \"Mumps Vaccine Ga ins Government Approval,\" Los Angeles Times , January 5, 1968, 12. 36 Peter Yates, \"Bullitt,\" (US: Warner Brothers, 1968). 90 announced the vaccine's approval on page 12 and the New York Times buried the story on page 72, as the war in Vietnam and the race to the moon took center stage.37 Also ambivalent about the vaccine\u2014or, more accurately, the vaccine's use\u2014were the health professionals grappli ng with what it meant to have such a tool at their disposal. Just prior to Mumpsvax's approval, the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at the Centers for Disease Contro l (CDC) recommended that the vaccine be administered to any child approaching or in puberty; men who had not yet had the mumps; and children living in institutions, wh ere \"epidemic mumps can be particularly disruptive.\"38 Almost immediately, groups of medical and scientific professionals began to take issue with various aspects of thes e national guidelines. For some, the vaccine's unknown duration was troubling (ongoing trials had by then demonstrated two years of protection); to others, the very nature of the disease agai nst which the shot protected raised philosophical questions about vaccina tion that had yet to be addressed. The Consumers Union flinched at the recomme ndation that institutionalized children be vaccinated, arguing that \"mere convenience is in sufficient justification for preventing the children from getting mumps and thus perhap s escorting them into adulthood without immunity.\"39 The editors of the New England Journal of Medicine advised against mass 37 UPI, \"Mumps Vaccine Gains Gove rnment Approval.\"; by U.S.,\" New York Times , January 5, 1968, 72. Among the nation's papers, only the Washington Post placed the story on the front page: Associat ed Press, \"Vaccine for Mumps Licensed,\" The Washington Post , January 5, 1968, A1. 38 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, \"Recommendation of the Pu blic Health Service Advisory Committee on I mmunization Practices,\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (1967): 430- 431. 39 Anonymous, \"New Mumps Vaccine Not for Everyone,\" Consumer Reports , July, 1968, 377. 91 application of mumps vaccine, arguing that th e \"general benignity of mumps\" did not justify \"the expenditure of large amounts of time, efforts, and funds.\" The journal's editors also decried the exa ggeration of mumps' complicatio ns, noting that the risk of damage to the male sex glands and nervous system had been overstated. These facts, coupled with the ever-present risk of hazar ds attendant with any vaccination program, justified, in their estimation, \"c onservative\" use of the vaccine.40 This debate over how to use the mumps v accine was often coupled with the more generalized reflection Mumpsvax helped spar k over the appropriate use of vaccines in what health experts began referring to as a ne w era of vaccination. In contrast to polio or smallpox, the eradicatio n of mumps was far from urgent, noted The Lancet 's editorial board. In this \"next stage\" of vaccination, marked by \"prevention of milder virus diseases,\" they noted, \"a cautious attitude now prevails.\" If vaccines were to be wielded against diseases that represented only a \"mi nor inconvenience,\" such as mumps, then such vaccines needed to be effective, completely free of side effects, long-lasting, and must not in any way increase more seve re adult forms of childhood infections. 41 Immunization officials at the CDC acknowledge d that with the approval of the mumps vaccine they had been \"forced to chart a course through unknown waters.\"42 They agreed that the control of severe illnesses had \"shifted the priorities for vaccine development to 40 Editorial, \"Mumps Vaccine: More Information Needed,\" The New England Journal of Medicine 278, no. 5 (1968): 275-276. 41 Editorial, \"Vaccination against Mumps,\" Mumps: A Review ce, Vaccine Development, and Recommendations for Use, Folder: Paper for Immunization Conference, Bo x 343357, Record Group 442, Centers for Disease Control, National Archives and Records Administration, Southeast Region. 92 the remaining milder diseases,\" but how to pr event these milder infections remained an open question. They delineated but a single cr iterion justifying a vaccine's use against such a disease: that it pose less of a hazard than its target infection.43 To other observers, this was not enough; a vaccine should not only be harmless, it should also produce immunity as well as or better than natu ral infection, maintain ed Oklahoma physician Harris Riley.44 The fact that the mumps vaccine in particular became available before the longevity of its protection was known compli cated matters for many weighing in on the professional debate. Perhaps, said Mass achusetts health officer Morton Madoff, physicians should be left to decide for themse lves how to use such vaccines as \"a matter of conscience.\"45 His comment revealed a hesitancy to delineate policy that many displayed when faced with the uncharted terr itory the mumps vaccine had laid bare. It also hinted at an attempt to shift future blame in case mumps vaccination went awry down the line\u2014a possibility that occurred to many observers given the still-unknown duration of the vaccine's protection. 43 Thomas Shope, Adolf Karchmer, and F.

Given a new tool, th at is, scientists were determined to figure out how best to use it. In th e process of doing so, they woul d also begin to create new representations of mu mps, effectively reframing the disease. A Changing Disease Shortly after the mumps vaccine's ap proval, CDC epidemiologist Adolf Karchmer gave a speech on the infection and its vaccine at an annual immunization conference. In light of the difficulties that he alth officials and medical associations were facing in trying to determine how best to us e the mumps vaccine, Karchmer devoted his talk to a review of existing knowledge on mumps. Aside from the fact the disease 46 See the Introduction for an overvi ew regarding the licensing and appr oval of vaccines in this period. 47 Editorial, \"Vaccination against Mumps.\" 48 Notes, March 12-15, 1968, Folder: Paper for Immunization Conference, Box 343357, Record Group 442, Centers for Disease Control, National Archives and Records Administration, Southeast Region. 94 preferentially struck children, particularly males, caused few annual deaths, and peaked in spring, there was much scien tists were still unsu re of, including the true prevalence of mumps (asymptomatic cases made commonly cited numbers a likely underestimate); whether the disease occurred in 6 to 7 year cy cles; whether infection was truly a cause of impotence and sterility; and th e precise nature of effects on the nervous system. Karchmer also expressed a concern shared by many: if the vaccine was administered to children and teens, and if it proved to w ear off with time, would vaccination thereby create a population of non-imm une adults even more suscep tible to the disease and its serious complications than th e current population? Karchmer and others thus worried\u2014at this early stage, at least\u2014that trying to control mumps not only wouldn't be worth the resources it would require, but might also create a bigger public health problem down the road.49 To address this concern, CDC scientists took a two-pronged approach to better understanding mumps and the potential for its vaccine. They reinstated mumps surveillance, which had been implemented following World War I but suspended after World War II.50 They also issued a request to stat e health departments across the country asking for help identifying local outbreaks of mumps that they could use as opportunities to study both the disease and the vaccine.51 Within months they had received several responses, and dispatched teams of epid emiologists to study mumps outbreaks in 49 Karchmer, Mumps: A Review of Surveillance, V accine Development, and Re commendations for Use. 50 Center for Disease Control, \"Current State of Mumps in the United States,\" The Journal of Infectious Diseases 132, no. 1 (1975): 106-109. 51 Memo, January 14, 1968, Folder: Epi Aid 58-51-1, Box 343357 No. 1, Record Group 442, Centers for Disease Control, National Archives and Records Administration, Southeast Region. 95 Campbell and Fleming Counties in Kentucky; Collin Anderson school for the \"mentally retarded\" in West Virginia; and the Fort Cu ster Home for the mentally retarded in Michigan.52 The copious notes the scientists took a nd the findings they later reported hint at deeply embedded preconceptions regardi ng the transmission of disease. These preconceptions, mapped onto mumps, forged ne w representations of the disease with important implications for evolvi ng mumps prevention policy. The Fort Custer Home in Augusta, Michigan hadn't had a single mumps outbreak in its ten years of existence when the CDC wa s invited to investigate a rash of 105 cases that occurred in late 1967. In pages upon pages of deta iled notes, the scientists documented the symptoms (largely low grade fe ver and runny noses) as well as the habits and behaviors of the home's children. They not ed not only who slept where, who ate with whom, and which playgrounds the children used , but also who was a \"toilet sitter,\" who was a \"drippy, drooley, messy eater,\" who was \"spastic\", who and who had \"impressive oral-centered behavi or.\" A child by the name of DeMiller was summed up as a boy who \"sits on toilet, not accepted by peers, seeks attention from attendants, sits and cries, picked on, not toilet traine d.\" The index case\u2014the boy who presumably brought the disease into the home\u2014was described as a \"gregarious and restless child who spends most of his waking hours darting from one play group to another, is notably untidy and often places hi s fingers or his thumbs in his mouth.\" The importance of these behaviors was unproven, re marked the researchers, but it seemed to 52 Documents pertaining to these outbreaks are located in folders titled Epi Aid 68-51-1; Epi Aid Epi Aid all in Box 343357 No. 1, Record Group 442, Centers for Disease Control, National Archives and Records Administration, Southeast Region. 96 them worth noting.53 Combined with other observations \u2014such as which child left the home, for example, to go on a picnic with hi s sister\u2014it's clear that the Fort Custer children were seen as a petri dish of infec tion threatening the community at large, much in the way their mental handicaps were pe rceived by midcentury society at large.54 Although the researchers' notes explicitly stated that the Fort Custer findings were not necessarily applicable to the genera l population, they were presented to the 1968 meeting of the American Public Health Associ ation as if they were . The investigation, the researchers reported, revealed th at mumps took about 15 to 18 days to incubate, and then lasted between three and six days, causing fe ver for one or two days. Complications were rare (3 children ages 11 and up suffered swo llen testes) and attack rates were highest among the youngest children.55 The team of investigators al so concluded that crowding alone was insufficient for mumps to spread; in teraction had to be \"intimate,\" involving activities that stimulated the flow and spread of saliva, such as the thumb-sucking and messy eating so common among not only institu tionalized children but children of all kinds.56 53 Notes, Fort Custer EIS Study, not dated, Folder: Fort Custer - Work Sheets and Potpourri, Box 343357 No. 1, Record Group 442, Centers for Disease Control, National Archives and Records Administration, Southeast Region. 54 On the subject of popular attitudes toward mentally retarded children in the 1950s and 1960s, see Steven Noll and James W.

But in asking a question about children, scientists ipso facto obtained an answer about children. Although mumps had previously been c onsidered a significant hea lth problem only among adults, the evidence in favor of i mmunizing children now began to accumulate. Such evidence came not only from studies like the one at Fort Custer, but also from local reports from across the country. When Bellingham and What com counties in Washington state made the mumps vaccine available in county and sc hool clinics, for example, few adults and older children sought the shot; instead, five- to nine-year-olds were the most frequently vaccinated. 57 This wasn't necessarily a bad thing, said Washington health officer Phillip Jones, who pointed out that there were two ways to attack a health problem: you could either immunize a susceptible population or protect them from exposure. Immunizing children did both, as it protected children direct ly and in turn stopped exposure of adults, who usually caught the disease from kids.58 Immunizing childre n sidestepped the problem he had noticed in his county: \"It is impractical to think that immunization of adults and teen-agers against mumps will have any significant impact on the total incidence of adult and teen-age mumps. It is very difficult to motivate these people,\" said Jones. \"On the other hand, parents of younge r children eagerly seek immunization of 57 A reviewer at the CDC noted that while many ofte n claimed that it was a challenged to immunize teens and adults, few had adequately produced quantitative support for this claim.

Polio immunization drives, as disc ussed in the previous chapter, had helped forge the impression that vaccines were \"f or children\" as opposed to adults. The establishment of routine pediat ric care, also discussed in th e previous chapter, offered a convenient setting for broad administration of vaccines as well as an audience primed to accept the practice. As a Washington, D.C. hea lth officer remarked, his district found that they could effectively use the smallpox vacci ne, which most \"mothers\" eagerly sought for their children, as \"bait\" to lure them in for vaccines against other infections.60 The vaccination of children got an added boost from the news that Russia, which by now was the U.S.'s key Cold War opponent and foil in the space race, had by the end of 1967 already vaccinated more than a m illion of its youngsters against mumps.61 The initial hesitation to vaccinate child ren against mumps was further dismantled by concurrent discourse concerning a separa te vaccine, against rubella (then commonly known as German measles). In the mid 1960s , rubella had joined polio and smallpox among the diseases actively instilling fear in parents\u2014particularly mothers. Rubella, a viral infection that typically caused rash a nd a fever, was harmless in children. But when pregnant women caught the infection, it posed a risk to the fetus. A nationwide epidemic 59 Ibid. 60 Stuart Auerbach, \"D.C. Has Rash of 261 Measles Cases,\" The Washington Post , February 10, 1970, Van Keep Chicago Tribune , September 30, 1967, B14. 99 of the disease in 1963 and 1964 resulted in a reported 30,000 fetal deat hs and the birth of more than 20,000 children with severe handicaps.62 No sooner had the nation's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices been fo rmed in fact, in 1964, than its members began to discuss the potential for a pending r ubella vaccine to prevent similar outbreaks in the future.63 But as research on the vaccine progressed, it became apparent that while the shot produced no side effects in children, in women it caused a \"rubella-like syndrome\" in addition to swollen and painful joints.64 Combined with the fact that the vaccine's teratogenicity was unknown, and th at the vaccination of women planning to become pregnant was perceived as logistically difficult, fede ral health officials concluded that \"the widespread immunization of child ren would seem to be a safer and more efficient way to control rubella syndrome.\"65 Immunization of children against rubella was further justified based on the observation that children were \"the major source of virus dissemination in the community.\"66 Pregnant women, that is, would be protected from the disease as long as they didn't come into contact with it.67 62 Brochure, not dated, Folder: 1964 Rubella Epidemic Cost Analysis, Box 343357, Record Group 442, Centers for Disease Control, National Archives and Records Administration, Southeast Region. 63 Meeting Minutes, Meeting No. 1 of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. 64 Memo from Adolf Karchmer to Martin D.

Eliminating rubella from communities was one means of obviating therapeutic abortions in women infected or exposed to the diseas e. The vaccine and abor tion were thus linked, argues Reagan, in the \"medical and scientific imaginary\" of the time.69 As a cause of birth defects and disabilities, rubella was more explicitly linked to the problem of \"mental retardation.\"70 Once perceived as a problem exclusive to the lower class, in the post-war decades mental retardation was increasingly perceived as a threat to the promise of mi ddle-class domesticity, notes historian Katherine Castles.71 Rubella immunization promotion thus built dir ectly upon the broad public's fears of both \"crippling\" diseases (such as polio ) as well as mental retardation.72 In its early years, so 68 Heller, The Vaccine Narrative , 62-63; Reagan, Dangerous Pregnancies: Mothers, Disabilities, and Abortion in America , 181. 69 Reagan, Dangerous Pregnancies: Mothers, Di sabilities, and Abortion in America , 180. 70 Though this term has since been abandoned as cruel and insensitive, it was a medically and socially accepted diagnosis at the time; I use it here as it was used in this time period. 71 Katherine Castles, \"Nice Average Americans: Postwar Parents' Groups and the Defense of the Normal Family,\" in Mental Retardation in America , ed.

Federal immuni zation brochures from the 1940s and 1950s occasionally mentioned that mumps could sw ell the brain or the meninges, the fluid surrounding the brain, but never mentioned a ri sk of brain damage. In the late 1960s, however, such insinuations began to appear in reports on the new vaccine. Hilleman's early papers on the mumps vaccine trials op ened with the repeated statement that \"Mumps is a common childhood disease that may be severely and even permanently crippling when it i nvolves the brain....\" 73 When Chicago announced Mumps Prevention Day, the city's medical direct or described mumps as a dise ase that can \"contribute to mental retardation.\"74 Though newspaper reporters focused more consistently on the risk mumps posed to male sterility, many echoe d the \"news\" that mumps could cause permanent damage to the brain. Such reports obscured substantial differentials of risk noted in the scientific literature. For un like the link between mu mps and testicular swelling, the relationship between mumps and brain damage or mental retardation was never quantified, even though \"benign\" swelli ng of meninges was documented to appear in 15% of childhood cases.75 In a nation just beginning to address the treatment of mentally retarded children as a social (i nstead of private) problem, however, any opportunity to prevent further cases of brain damage, no matter how small, was welcomed by both parents and cost-ben efit calculating muni cipalities. 73 See for example R. E. Weibel et al., \"Live Attenua ted Mumps-Virus Vaccine. 3. Clinical and Serologic Aspects in a Field Evaluation,\" New England Journal of Medicine 276, no. 5 (1967): 245-251; J.

The notion that vaccines protected the health (a nd, therefore, the productivity and utility) of future adult citizens had long been in place by the time th e rubella vaccine was licensed in 1969 (see Chapter 1). In addition to fulfilling this role, the rubella vaccine and the mumps vaccine\u2014which was most commonly depicted as a guard against sterility and \"damage to the sex glands\" in men\u2014were al so deployed to ensure the existence of future citizens, by protecting the reproductive capacities of the American population. The vaccination of children against both rubella and mumps were thus linked in the social imaginary to cultural anxiety over falling fertility in the post-Baby Boom U.S. This anxiety was captured in cultural productions as di verse as Paul Ehrlich's 1968 bestseller The Population Bomb and the popular television sitcom The Brady Bunch . 77 In a 1973 episode of the show, mumps caused panic in the Brady household\u2014with its three teenage boys\u2014when a presumably still unvaccinated Bobby feared he had caught the disease from his girlfriend and spread it to his family.78 This cultural anxiety in turn influenced immunization policy: CDC scientists stresse d the import of immunizing against mumps given men's fears of mumps-induced impotence and sterility\u2014even as they 76 Reagan, Dangerous Pregnancies: Mothers, Di sabilities, and Abortion in America , 181. 77 Paul R. Ehrlich, The Population Bomb , A Sierra Club-Ballantine Book (New York: Ba llantine Books, 1968). 78 Sherwood Schwartz, \"Never Too Young,\" in The Brady Bunch (USA: American Broadcasting Company, 1973). 103 acknowledged that such complications were \"rather poorly documented and thought to occur rarely, if at all.\"79 At the same time, the revolution in reproductive technol ogies, rights, and discourse that extended from the 1960s into the 1970s reshaped American\u2014particularly middle class American\u2014attitudes toward childre n in a manner that had direct bearing on the culture's willingness to accept a growing number of vaccines for children. The year 1967 saw more vaccines under deve lopment than ever before.80 Merck's own investment in vaccine research and prom otion exemplified the trend; even as doctors and health officials were debating how to use Mumpsvax, Hilleman's lab was testing a combined vaccine against measles, rubella, and mu mps that would ultimately help make the company a giant in the vaccine market. 81 This boom in vaccine commodification coincided with the gradual shrinking of American families that new contraceptive technologies and the changing social ro le of women had helped engender. The link between these two trends found e xpression in shifting attitudes toward the value of children, which were well-captured by Chicago Tribune columnist Joan Beck in 1967. Beck predicted that 1967 would be a \"vintage year\" for babies, for the 1967 baby stood \"the best chance in history of being truly wanted,\" and the \"best chance in history to grow up healthier and bright er and to get a bette r education than his 79 Karchmer, Mumps: A Review of Surveillance, V accine Development, and Re commendations for Use.

This attitude is indicative of the soaring emotiona l value that children began to accrue in the last half of the twentieth century, as historia n Mary Ann Mason has described.83 Beginning in the 1960s, vaccination advocates at times played to this valuation of children to emphasize the importance of vaccinating against diseases that seemed rare or mild, or whose complications seemed even rarer. Noted one CDC author, who extolled the importance of vaccination against increasingly rare diseases , \"the disease incidence may be one in a thousand, but if that one is your child, the incidence is a hundred percent.\" 84 Historian Paula Fass has pointed out that discourse concerning the \"wantedness\" of individual children in the post-Baby Boom era reflected a predominantly white, middle-class conceptualization of children.85 As birth rates continued to fall, reaching a nadir in 1978, vaccines kept company w ith other commodities\u2014a suburban home, quality schooling, a good college\u2014that shaped the truly wanted child's middle class 82 Joan Beck, \"It'll Be Vintage Year for Babies Born in the U.S.,\" Chicago Tribune , January 3, 1967, B1. 83 Mary Ann Mason, \"The St ate as Superparent,\" in Childhood in America , ed.

This portrayal dovetailed with the frequent depiction of the mild infections, and mumps in particular, as \"nuisances\" Amer ican no longer needed to \"tolerate.\"87 No longer did Americans of any age have to suffer the \"variety of spots and lumps and whoops\" that once plagued American childhood, noted one journalist.88 Even CDC publications commented on \"the luxury and eas e of health provided by artificial antigens\" of the modern age.89 And even though mumps, for one , was not a serious disease, remarked a writer for Changing Times , the vaccination was there \"for those who want to be spared even the slight discomfort of a case.\"90 Mumps vaccination in fact epitomized the realization of eas e of modern living through vaccinati on. Because it kept kids home from school and parents home from work, \"it is inconvenient, to say the least, to have mumps,\" said a health official from Mass achusetts, adding, \"Why s hould we tolerate it any longer?\"91 Vaccines against infections such as mumps might not be perceived as 86 Ibid., 182. 87 See for example Anonymous, \"Mumps May Be on Its Way Out,\" Daily Defender , June 27, 1966, 2; Van to Time,\" Mademoiselle , July, 1977, 126. 89 National Communicable Disease Center, Immunization against Disease (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1967), 1. 90 Anonymous, \"Vaccinations Everyone Ought to Have,\" Changing Times , September, 1974, 11-13.

That vaccination in general was an accoutrement of middle-class living was reified by reports in the early to mid-1970s of urban outbreaks. Throughout the 1970s, rates of vaccine-preventable diseases declin ed substantially. Nonetheless, epidemics did persist, in both cities and in smaller communities.92 Immunization rates were low enough among the urban poor to be singled out by federal health officials\u201460% of children in this population weren't protected against polio in 1976\u2014as a likely cause of such outbreaks. Federal health officials attribut ed these low rates to federal funding cuts, concerns about adverse reacti ons, and just plain ignorance. 93 And as outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases occurred in cities across the country, urban \"ghetto\" and \"slum\" areas with their \"highly mob ile, poorly educated, and impoverished population[s]\" were typically held to blame.94 Historian Charles Rosenberg has argued that disease etiologies (par ticularly hypothetical ones) \"p roject and rationalize widely 92 See for example R. D. Greenwood, \"Mum ps Outbreak in a Small Community,\" Journal of the Kansas Medical Society 78, no. 11 (1972): 493; B. P. Carlin and S. S.

Th e perceived link between disease and urban danger was colorfully (if insidiously) illu strated in the cartoon character Emmy Immunity, who was developed by health official s in the southeast to promote the cause of immunization on TV and in radio spots. Emmy cleverly fought agai nst the Dirty Disease Gang, an enemy whose very conception reflect ed prejudice against the perceived filthy, dangerous, and often non-white denizens of declining urban America.96 As the 1970s progressed, references to epidemics localized in the \"ghetto\" gave way to references to the \"inner city\" and \"urban poverty area,\" but the implications remained the same. Even though one-third to one-half of all U.S. children were lacking a ll or part of the series of shots that could protect them from polio, diph theria, pertussis, tetanus, measles, mumps, and rubella, the urban poor bore the lion's sh are of culpability for the persistence of vaccine-preventable diseases, including mumps, in the U.S.97 95 Rosenberg, \"Framing Disease: Illne ss, Society, and History,\" xxii. 96 Program materials, Folder: Information 3 Imm 1964-19 67, Box 334062, Office of the Director Files, Box 2, Record Group 442, Centers for Disease Control, National Archives and Records Administration, Southeast Region.

ACIP's 1971 recommendation to discontinue routine vaccination of children against smallpox was hotly debated in the medical and public health community for several years, during which many counties and individual doctors chose to continue vaccinating against th e disease. In addition to the diseas e's rarity in the U.S., ACIP cited in its decision low infectivity of th e smallpox virus, the effectiveness of vaccinating only close contacts of smallpox patients, and the adverse effects of smallpox vaccination, which carried a \"low risk of severe complications and death.\" See Center for Disease Co ntrol, \"Recommendations of the U.S. Public Health 108 Combined vaccines offered a seemingly elegant solution to the problem of immunizing poor, mobile, ignorant members of the population. As the number of vaccines grew, health officials often discusse d the need for \"new and simpler approaches to immunization,\" and the success of the comb ined vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DPT), availabl e since 1949, suggested a good model.98 Health officials had their reasons for wanting additional combined vaccines; Merck had its own. The drug company's experience promoting its vaccine against measles had illustrated the challenges of getting parents to accept an addi tional vaccine for their children, and Merck had anticipated a similar challenge with mu mps, according to historian Louis Galambos and Jane Sewell. A vaccine that combined mumps protection with other, accepted immunizations would ensure a place for Mu mpsvax in the market, reasoned Merck scientists and executives. It would also address competitive threats: other companies planned to add measles to DPT, and Merc k, which had no DPT vaccine, feared it would be \"squeezed out of the market.\" 99 In 1971, Merck released two combined vaccines: one against measles and rubella and another agai nst measles, rubella, and mumps.

But the combined vaccine also di rectly impacted evolving immunization policy, which in turn helped sell Mumpsvax. In its 1972 update on mumps vaccination, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices broadened its reco mmendation to state that anyone over the age of one could be vaccinated\u2014but that mumps vaccination should never take priority over \"more essential ongoing community health activities.\" (The committee declined to specify what these might be.) Combined vaccines, they noted, were still being tested. In 1977, however, the committee reaffirmed the stance that mumps was a low-priority disease but added that \"large-scale pr oduction\" of combined vaccines \"have made mumps vaccination a prac tical component of routine immunization activities.\" As a result, they wrote, \"Liv e mumps virus vaccine is recommended for all children at any ag e after 12 months.\" 101 In the same way that DPT enabled pertussis vaccine to \"piggyback\" on diphtheria vaccine's greater efficacy and acceptance, as historian James Colgrove has argued, MMR enabled mumps to piggyback on acceptance of vaccination against measles and rubella.102 The combined vaccine overrode for good 100 E.

Although mumps was relatively benign, argued the CDC's Karchmer, \"considerable morbidity, economic loss, and loss of productive time result because of the large numbers affected.\" 104 From the late 1960s through the 1970s, health officials increasingl y favored such cost-based arguments. The measles eradication campaign that the nation launched in 1966 added economic justifications to the list of bullet points used to encourage vaccine uptake among the public.105 Measles didn't just cost a family the pr ice of a doctor's visit, it also cost a family lost income if parents had to stay hom e to tend to sick child ren, and it cost schools funding in districts where budget allotments were based on attendance. Adding in the direct and indirect complications, any prev entable disease\u2014not just measles\u2014was an economic anvil when compared to the cost of vaccination. By keeping millions of Americans alive and in good health, vaccine s and other drugs helped contribute ten billion dollars a year to the U.S. ec onomy, noted AMA president Charles Lowell Hudson.106 Thus, while the \"humanistic benefits\" of vaccination were obvious, economic 103 Galambos and Sewell, Networks of Innovation: Vaccine Devel opment at Merck, Sharp Dohme and Mulford, 1895-1995 , 118. 104 Karchmer, Mumps: A Review of Surveillance, V accine Development, and Re commendations for Use. 105 Measles eradication was modeled on polio eradica tion, but health officials miscalculated popular demand for the measles vaccine; additional arguments were therefore deployed in order to encourage vaccine uptake. See Chapter 1 for fu rther discussion on this point. 106 Charles Lowell Hudson, \"Looking Ahead,\" Vital Speeches of the Day 33, no. 15 (1967): 465. 111 benefits were a crucial way of justifying vaccination programs, wrote CDC scientists James Witte and Norman Axnick in 1975. \"The expression in economic terms of the savings accrued by preventing disease require s a new parlance for physicians and other health professionals. The benefits derived fr om immunization must be described in terms that can be added or subtracted,\" they urged. 107 The imperative to de scribe vaccines in such terms was also created by the very prac tice of vaccinating against mild diseases, which necessitated new justifications for their use. Economic arguments not only acquired tr action as a means of justifying mass immunization against the mild er diseases. They also gained ground as the cost of vaccines and health care generally began to rise \"out of sight,\" as Pfizer president John J. Powers put it in 1970.108 Vaccines in particular were becoming more expensive because of the high cost of development, noted one FDA regulator.109 As they became pricier, the return on investment in vaccines for a cash-st rapped city or municipality became an increasingly requisite calcu lation. But the increasing prev alence of economic arguments in favor of vaccines was also a symptom of another trend\u2014growing awareness of vaccine hazards, which prompted some vaccine makers to leave the market and would soon begin to chip away at broad public acceptan ce of vaccination programs. The burdensome investment required for vaccine research and development had driven many small 107 J. J.

By the mid 1970s, even some large vaccine manufacturers were beginning to pull out of the market, prompted by profitability concerns that were being compounded by fear of lawsuits. During the 1960s, a series of lawsuits had been filed against manufacturers of both th e Salk and Sabin polio vaccines, including the deadly lot manufactur ed by Cutter Laboratories, described in Chapter 1. The rulings in favor of victims of the Cutter incident as well as two individuals\u2014a thirty-nine year old man a nd eight-month-old girl\u2014who had contracted polio following vaccination publicized the inherent risks of vaccination and spooked manufacturers. 110 By 1975, the 11 drug firms who had pr oduced the vast majority of the nation's vaccine stock in 1960 had been wh ittled down to six firms, making some vaccines available through only a sole manufacturer.111 The case of the eight-month-old girl, Anita Reyes, was particularly signifi cant in that judges he ld that the vaccine manufacturer, Wyeth Laboratorie s, was responsible for ensu ring that individuals were duly informed of the risks of vaccination before submitting to the procedure.112 The lawsuits were contemporaneous with a series of disputes and expos\u00e9s regarding the mismanagement of vaccine regul ation at the federal level. In 1971, Senator Abraham Ribicoff (formerly John F. Kennedy's Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare) publicly accused the federal Divisi on of Biologic Standards, responsible for 110 The cases, including Davis v. Wyeth and Reyes v.

Alerted to the fact by former DBS scientists, he ordered an investigation of the charges.113 The resulting report reveal ed that DBS officials responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of approved vaccines had ignored evidence of inadequately killed vi rus in polio vaccines and the pr esence of tumorigenic monkey virus in polio and adenovirus vaccines. They had also inadequately tested measles vaccines for safety; approved several flu vaccines using in adequate tests for potency; and reassigned or demoted DBS scientists who voi ced concern over the practices.114 The news that DBS had approved 32 vaccines that were later prove d to be either worthless or dangerous made some headlines\u2014\"Valueless Vaccines?\" ran the headline in Time \u2014but for the most part the dispute remained confined to government regulato rs and scientists.115 As a solution, in 1973, DBS's responsibil ities were transferred to th e Bureau of Biologics at the FDA.116 But regulatory snafus did not disapp ear. In 1975, a few government scientists again came forth, this time charging that FDA had not sufficiently te sted the long-term safety of unavoidable contaminants in live-virus vaccines.117 In 1976, government haste and oversight was prominently on display when a massive federal sw ine flu inoculation 113 UPI, \"Ribicoff Says Agen cy Ignored Vaccine Risk,\" Los Angeles Times , October 15, 1971, A12. 114 Nicholas Wade, \"Division of Biologics Standards: Scientific 115 Anonymous, \"Valueless Vaccines?,\" Time , April 17, 1972. 116 Nicholas Wade, \"Division of Biologics Standards: Reaping the Whirlwind,\" Gina Bari Kolata, \"Phage in Live Virus Vaccines: Are They Harmful to People?,\" Science 187 (1975): 522-523. 114 program was implicated in several deaths of elderly adults and hundreds of cases of the immune disorder Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome.118 The news prompted one mother to exclaim, \"That's it. There's no way they're going to get me a nywhere near a needle,\" as journalists began to ask, \"Just how serious is th e threat of a swine-flu epidemic this year? Are inoculations really worth the risk?\"119 These questions echoed questions from a decade before regarding the seriousness of mu mps, only now they were prompted not by doubts of necessity, but by fears of potential hazards. Mumps Post Vaccine The cumulative effect that these events w ould have on the state of popular faith in vaccines would not become starkly apparent until the early 1980s. In the meantime, the vaccination of children continued apace, incl uding vaccination against mumps. Despite confusion about mumps immunization in its early years, by 1972 Merck had sold more than 11 million doses of Mumpsvax.120 By 1974, 40% of U.S. children had been vaccinated against the disease.121 But even as mumps immunization rates gradually climbed, overall rates of immunization stagnate d or fell.

The Orange County, California health depart ment adopted a particularly intimidating motto to convey this idea, dubbing failur e to immunize against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, and rubella the \"seven deadly health sins.\" 122 The practice of portraying the vaccine-preventable diseases in this way culminated with an unprecedented childhood immunization effort sp earheaded by President Jimmy Carter's administration (described in the next chapter). In that late 1970s initiative, the campaign materials issued by local health departme nts and the flurry of accompanying media reports all contained the same message: any disease that could be prevented with a vaccine was dangerous, if not deadly, to childr en. In such accounts, any difference in risk or severity among infections was depicted as negligible. Measles was a disease that caused brain damage and deafness, mumps a di sease that caused deafness, polio a disease that caused paralysis or death.123 A 1978 article in Good Housekeeping told the stories of seven-year-old Joey, who became deaf after a bout of mumps, five month old Marcy, who died of whooping cough, and twelve year old June, who suffered measles-induced brain damage. Wrote the author, \"If this sounds scary, it's meant to.\"124 122 Anonymous, \"7 Health Sins Listed; Immunizations Urged for County Childre,\" Los Angeles Times , December 6, 1973, OC-A16. 123 Dan Kaercher, \"Immunization: A Call to Action,\" Better Homes and Gardens , September, 1979, 70. 124 Midge Lasky Schildkraut, \"The New Threat to Your Children's Health,\" Good Housekeeping , August, 1978, 219-220. 116 The transformation of mumps into a se rious disease of children was neither deliberately calculated nor entirely smooth. Hi nts that such a shift was imminent were evident in the late 1960s, when the prospect of a new mumps vaccine prompted a few observers to argue that the infection's occasional severity made it a disease worth not just preventing, but eradicating. 125 Between 1968 and 1978, scientific journal articles, press reports, and advice books for parents and docto rs contained uneven portrayals of the disease's severity. On the whole, however, mumps' image in this time period morphed from that of childhood nuisance to th at of deadly crippler. In 1968, the Washington Post called mumps a \"relatively harmless childhood disease,\" the Los Angeles Sentinel called it a \"mild childhood di sease,\" and the New York Times reported that \"serious complications in young children are unusual.\"126 Ten years later, all references to mumps as a mild disease vanished from popular portr ayals, with the exception of reports that sought to illustrate the danger of perceiving mumps in this way: \"Measles, mumps and the like...are not just part of growing up....thos e 'minor' ills can cripple and kill, too,\" reported the New York Times in 1978.127 125 Calls to eradicate mumps were in fact infrequen t, but see for example Anonymous, \"Georgians Play Major Role in Developing New Vaccine,\" Atlanta Daily World , January 7, 1968, 1; Reviewer comments, Re: Public Acceptance of Mumps Immunization. In 1 968, Massachusetts health officials announced that they had unanimously decided to eradicate mumps; the announcement sparked a debate between health officials and physicians, who argued that the vaccine's use should be left to their discretion. See for example, Fiumara, \"Use of Mumps Vaccine.\"; T. C. Peebles et al., \"Use of Mumps Vaccine,\" New England Journal of Medicine 281, no. 12 (1969): 679. 126 Anonymous, \"Mumps Vaccine Now Ready for Public,\" Los Angeles Sentinel , March 28, 1968, Dodi Schultz, \"Why Childhood Diseases Are Coming Back,\" New York Times Sunday Magazine , May 7, 1978, 35. 117 Mentions of the disease's severity in ch ildren versus adults also disappeared over the course of the 1970s. Mumps \"is an acute vi ral disease...which can lead to orchitis and meningoencephalitis,\" reported the Atlanta Daily World in 1978, making no reference to the actual risk of complications nor any distin ction between the risk of sequelae in adults versus children, or males versus females.128 Portrayals of the disease were still sometimes confused, but by now they were also consiste ntly daunting: \"Mumps frequently leads to inflammation of the covering of the brain (meni ngitis) or, more rarely, of the brain itself (encephalitis). As many as one in every se ven to nine children with mumps may show signs of these complications (but actual cases are not as common). Occasionally, permanent damage such as deafness results,\" Good Housekeeping reported in 1978.129 Such portrayals\u2014even if perplexing\u2014began to firmly level the playing field between mumps and the rest of the vaccine-preventable diseases, enabling the once mild infection to keep close company with long-dread ed diphtheria, smallpox, and polio. Notably, such portrayals directly and unquestioningly parroted the information coming from government sources. While CDC immunization reco mmendations from early in the 1970s had referred to mumps-i nduced meningeal swelling and deafness as \"rare\" and mumps-induced sterility as \"ver y rare,\" a 1978 HEW brochure informed the public simply, \"Mumps can cause deafness, di abetes, and brain damage. It can make boys sterile.\"130 The mention of diabetes is a clear si gnal that frustrated government health 128 Anonymous, \"Measles, Mumps and Ru bella Threaten the Unprotected,\" Atlanta Daily World , January 3, 1978, 3. 129 Schildkraut, \"The New Threat to Your Children's Health.\" 130 Education U.S. Department of Health, and Welfare, Protect Your Child (DHEW Publication No. OHDS 78-02027) (Washington, DC: Office of Human Development Services, 1978). 118 officials had decided, consciously or not, that any risk of disease complication was worth wielding in the crusade to encourage vaccina tion. For at that time, evidence of a link between mumps and diabetes was hypothetical , based on isolated case reports and the infection's potential to cause pancreatic swelling. The link was too tenuous to be mentioned in any of the Advisory Comm ittee on Immunization Practices' published recommendations on mumps immunization in th e 1970s, and it in fact remains disputed to this day. But a disease that reportedly cau sed diabetes, deafness, and brain damage was certainly as worthy of prevention as a dis ease that caused paralysis\u2014as indeed many Americans seemed to agree. Whether because of the accessibility of vaccines or the portrayal of vaccine-prevent able diseases during the Carter immunization campaign\u2014or both\u2014immunization rates rose, including rates of immunizat ion against mumps. By the early 1980s, 97% of American children were vaccinated against mumps. 131 In 1985, the incidence of the disease fe ll to just under 3,000 cases\u2014an all time low and a 98.1% drop from 1968 levels.132 Conclusion Mumps had of course long been categor ized as a common childhood disease. But resources to control the disease were corralled only when the infection posed a threat to the nation's security, by infecting grown men engaged in military or economically productive pursuits. From the beginning of th e twentieth century to the end, efforts to 131 Centers for Disease Control, \"Current Trends Mumps -- United States, 1984-1985,\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 35, no. 13 (1986): 216-219. 132 Ibid. 119 thwart mumps' spread through crowded set tings, whether barracks or work camps or mental institutions or school districts, belied a concern for the impact of epidemic mumps on the social order of the state. Vaccines against mumps\u2014from Lederle's half-effective vaccine to Merck's MMR\u2014were tools of govern ance that served the national interests of security and economic efficiency. Mumps vacci nation in the U.S. thus exemplified what historian Dorothy Porter has described as th e modern democratic, free-enterprise state's configuration of the individual citizen as a \"political and ec onomic unit of a collective whole.\"133 That Merck's new live virus mumps vaccine was ultimately sold and bought as an integral part of childhood car e is testament to the many socio-cultural meanings that mumps specifically and vaccination generally acquired from 1968 on. Before the 1960s, mumps was a threat to U.S. supremacy because it harmed soldiers and laborers; after its vaccine became available, it represented a threat to U.S. supremacy because it harmed the nation's ability to produce future soldiers and laborers. Before the 1960s, mumps was an uncomfortable if generally innocuous part of childhood, as captured in the Jimmy Dean lyrics about a daughter grow ing older: \"It's a rapid j ourney and you'll travel light, leaving behind you measles, mumps, freckles, bumps, bubble gum and me.\"134 By the 1980s, mumps vaccine, usually given as MMR, had replaced mumps itself as the uncomfortable if generally innocuous part of childhood. Playful cultural references to the disease became a relic of another era. And the value of vaccinating children was firmly 133 Porter, Health, Civilization, and the State , 57. 134 Jimmy Dean, To a Sleeping Beauty (Columbia Records, 1962). 120 calculated in terms of the dollars it save d families, businesses, counties, and the country.135 Federal health officials and pharmaceu tical giant Merck certainly played undeniably active roles in securing a place for mumps in the roster of childhood vaccines, but mumps vaccination was accepted by American s in this period because of what the disease itself came to signify. Once brought into the spotlight, mumps infection was framed by the cultural preoccupations of the day, including a ccess to technological conveniences, the growing emotional va luation of middle- class children, and predominantly middle-class anxieties a bout reproduction, mental retardation, urbanization, and economic security. Mumps ma y not have been a publ ic health priority when Merck's vaccine was introduced, but th e vaccine warranted the disease special attention, linking it to the issues of its day. In the end, Americans came to accept the widespread prevention of mumps among children as a remedy for a complex combination of social worries and a convenience no mode rn family should have to go without. 135 Melinda Wharton et al., \"A Large Outb reak of Mumps in the Postvaccine Era,\" The Journal of Infectious Diseases 158, no. 6 (1988): 1253-1260. 121 Chapter 3 A Shot at Reform Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and the Immunization of Children Mothers and fathers browsing throu gh the November issue of Parents magazine in 1977 came across an article from an unusual contributor: U.S. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Jose ph Califano. Califano's article informed readers that President Jimmy Carter had ma de a commitment to protect American children from preventable disease, but that this commi tment could only be fulfilled if parents cooperated and got their childre n vaccinated. Califano urged parents not to allow diseases that were once \"deadly, daily facts of life\" s only, or even most prominent, concern. \"The cost to each family, and the nation as a whole, of fully immunizing our nation's young is negligible compared to the cost, in dollars and human suffering, when children are attacked by diseases such as polio, te tanus, whooping cough a nd diphtheria,\" Califano wrote. \"All it takes to prevent these diseases is a few simple and inexpensive shots for every child.\" The shots, listed in an acco mpanying chart, included vaccines against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, m easles, rubella, and, of course, mumps.1 Califano's assertion\u2014that shots were ch eap and the diseases they prevented pricey\u2014was no mere selling point; it was, instead, th e very reason the Carter administration had thrown its support behi nd a nationwide initiativ e to vaccinate all American children. As Medicare and othe r public health care costs ballooned, no 1 Joseph A. Califano, \"Immunizing Our Children,\" Parents , November, 1977, 122. 122 president in the 1970s or afterward was able to ignore the economic burden they presented. Republican and Democratic administrations embraced a variety of public and private solutions to the problem in the last decades of the twentieth century. During that time frame, two Democrats, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, were elected on platforms that emphasized a need for health care reform that controlled costs and secured access to services for the majority of Americans. Once in office, both Carter and Clinton proposed\u2014with very different degrees of urgency\u2014substantial reforms. Neither President's proposals were adopted, but each one succeeded in implementing incremental measures toward reform that were ba sed on the cost-effect iveness of childhood vaccination. The childhood vaccination initiatives passe d under Carter and Clinton did much to shape the current state of vaccination in the U.S. School entry laws became the norm in states across the country in the 1970s, but were given teeth by changes championed by the Carter administration. Thanks to ch anges instated under Clinton, federally recommended vaccines are now available to al l children, no matter their family's income or insurance status; child vaccination rates ha ve also remained consistently high since Clinton's time in office. For Carter and Clinton, childhood vaccine initiatives fulfilled domestic policy agenda goals to improve th e plight of children. But the two southern Democrats also deployed vacci nation initiatives as politica lly expedient approaches to cutting health care costs; for both, the initiativ es characterized small steps toward a larger vision of overall health system reform. Cons idering these two initiatives side by side illuminates the ways in which vaccination po licies were deployed as instruments of health reform in the late twentieth century. Fu rther, it demonstrates the realization of the 123 long-held belief (see Chapter 1) that v accinating children is the most economically expedient route to a h ealthier popula ce overall. Despite their origins in Democratic ad ministrations, the Clinton and Carter vaccination initiatives reflected different se ts of political preoccupations and values concerning the health rights and responsibilit ies of American citizens. In addition to being shaped by different political philosophi es, the two federal va ccination initiatives were also shaped by the different economic, po litical, social, and cultu ral contexts of their times. As federal projects advancing the provis ion of health care to every child citizen, the two initiatives became important referent s in contemporary debates over the state of the nation's health care system and the governme nt's role in regulati ng or reforming that system. As effectively deployed tools of hea lth reform, the immunization initiatives of the Carter and Clinton administrations ha d a pronounced influence on attitudes and beliefs regarding vaccination in the late 1970s and the 1990s, two periods in which the scope and scale of vaccination programs were greatly expanded. The full impact of this influence on lay beliefs about vaccines is described in subsequent chapters; here, the initiatives are described and analyzed as political tools founded on and advancing the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating children. Carter's Childhood Immunization Initiative On April 7, 1977, newly elected Presid ent Jimmy Carter announced an unprecedented, \"high-visibility,\" two-year in itiative to promote im munization. \"Our goal is to reduce as much as humanly possibl e the numbers of youngsters without medical protection against many major childhood afflictio ns,\" Carter wrote in a memo to cabinet 124 members during his third month in office.2 The administration set a goal of immunizing 90 percent of all children ag ainst seven preventable inf ections by October 1979, and of establishing a permanent system to ensure the full and timely immunization of the 3 million children born each year. It was an ambitious undertaking: when Carter took office, 20 million of the nation's 52 million children under 14 weren't fully protected against polio, measles, mumps, rubella , diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus.3 The number of children getting vaccinated against polio, diph theria, tetanus, and pertussis had been steadily declining since the late 1960s; as a result, measles ca ses in particular began to rise in the early 1970s, with several outbreak s erupting in cities across the U.S. in 1976 and 1977. But while a national vaccination camp aign seemed an intuitive response to declining immunization rates a nd outbreaks, in another resp ect, the timing of such an initiative may have struck some observers as odd. A year earlier, President Gerald Ford, flanked by polio vaccine developers Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin, had announced an unprecedented campaign to immunize the en tire U.S. population against a prophesied epidemic of swine flu. The epidemic neve r materialized, however, and the $135 million project was abruptly terminated in Decem ber 1976, following reports of paralysis and deaths due to a neurological condition li nked to the vaccine. The immunization program was widely mocked in the press, and led to doubt and confusion among the public. Given \"this whole swine flu business... I am wondering now whether al l vaccinations are really 2 Memo, Jimmy Carter to Heads of Executive Offices and Agencies, 4/7/ 77, Folder: Immunization, Box 32, Collection JC-DPS, Jimmy Carter Library. 3 Fact Sheet, Childhood Immunization Initiative, Folder: Immunization, Box 32, Collection JC-DPS, Jimmy Carter Library. 125 safe and effective,\" a Chicago Tribune reader wrote to the paper.4 In a triple strike out for health officials, the swine flu debacle coin cided with two unforeseen outbreaks, one an unexplainable \"mystery disease,\" and another a flu outbreak that health officials had inadequately prepared for. \"The inability of federal health officials to explain the deaths of the people who attended the American Le gion convention in Philadelphia last summer, the hullabaloo over a swine flu epidemic that has not yet materialized, and the irony of not being able to get the A/Victoria flu v accine without receivi ng the swine flu shot obviously have left the public shaken,\" Harri s survey pollsters c oncluded in early 1977, just after Carter had taken office. 5 During the 1976 election, which took place as the flaws of the highly publicized swine flu vaccination program were b ecoming clear, Carter ran\u2014and won\u2014as a Washington outsider who pledged to return tr ansparency, fairness and efficiency to the federal government in the post-Watergate era.6 The 1976 campaign took place in the midst of a deep recession, high unemployment, and a staggering rise in fuel prices\u2014all of which colored Carter's approaches to his domestic policy agenda.7 In his inaugural address, Carter had called on the nation to take on \"moral duties\" and work together with 4 G.

Turning down thermostats in winter was cer tainly one form of individual sacrifice for the common good, but the invocation also aptly applied to the vacc ination initiative that Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, urged newly appoint ed Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) Secretary Joseph Califano to spearhead in early 1977. Califano, who had helped author Great Society le gislations as chief domestic advisor to President Lyndon Johnson, had sought the post in Carter's cabinet, eager to be part of a renewed push for social programs in the first Democr atic administration in eight years.9 Indeed, the media, and many Democrats, saw Califano's appointme nt as presaging \"a new dawn of social concern\" and a return to th e \"fond yesterdays\" of the L yndon Johnson years, when civil rights legislation was passed, the War on Pove rty declared, and Medi care and Medicaid established to provide health ca re to the elderly and indigent.10 Califano assumed the HEW helm with high energy and visibility, prompting one re porter to remark that \"he took on his job as though he in tended to carry out every Ca rter campaign promise before Congress even went home for summer vacation.\"11 8 Jimmy Carter, Inaugural Address, January 20, 1977 , The American Presidency Project, University of California, Santa Barbara. 9 Joseph A.

By 1977, health care spending constituted more than 8% of gross national pr oduct, and individual health care expenses ate up more than 10% of the average house hold's income. Runaway hospital costs and the high rate of health care in flation (the cost of medical se rvices was climbing more than 10% a year, 3% faster than th e rise in costs of other goods and services) were routine front page news. The administration would take two years to draft a proposal for complete reform, but childhood immunization presented itself as one cost cutting measure within easy reach. One reason why: the Carters had a proven model to follow. With a budget of just $100,000 and the coopera tion of county clinics, community groups, the National Guard, and a network of over 10,000 volunteers, the Ar kansas immunization campaign led by Betty Bumpers, wife of Se nator Dale Bumpers and a friend of the Carters, had fully immunized more than 225,000 Arkansas children in 1973\u2014a fact Bumpers and her husband reminded the new President and First Lady of just after Carter's inauguration. 12 Following Bumpers' model, the Children's Immunization Initiative, as the Carter proposal came to be known, was billed as a low-cost program with the promise of extraordinarily high returns\u2014 critical positioning in the mi dst of the deep economic recession Carter had inherited from Ford. In press conferences, releases, brochures and speeches, administration officials tallied the hi storical costs of not immunizing children: 12 Letter and Fact Sheet to Parents and Volunteers from Betty Bumpers, \"Every Child by 74\", 1974, Folder: Children's Immunization Program, Box 7, Collection JC-FL: Records of the First Lady's Office Jimmy Carter Library. 128 the rubella epidemic of 1964 had cost the U. S. $1.5 billion, and every child disabled by preventable disease cost states and the fede ral government a total of $900,000 in direct and indirect costs.13 By contrast, mass immunization against measles was estimated to have saved the country $1.3 billion in health care spending between 1963 and 1974.14 For $6 per child\u2014the cost of completely immuni zing every unprotected child in the country in 1977\u2014the nation could expect considerable savings on future health care costs, Califano told attendees at one conference. \"By immunizing children...we save millions of dollars that would otherwis e have to be used on hospital costs and long-term care for those who are seriously aff licted,\" said the Secretary. 15 Others, including Senator Bumpers, estimated that widespread immuniza tion would reduce the na tion's health care spending by $5 to $10 billion per year.16 In keeping with Bumpers' Arkansas mode l, Carter's immunization initiative was not a traditional big government endeavor. Like the Arkansas program, it was frugal: $57 million was appropriated for the program over three years, totaling less than half the budget for swine flu immunizations alone in 1976. Such a slim budget prevented Congress from looking like \"a bunch of fool s,\" the way funding the failed swine flu program had made them look, in Senator Bumpers' words.17 Bumpers advocated before 13 Senator Dale Bumpers (AR), Congressional Record, January 31, 1977, Washington, DC, S1661-1663. 14 Immunization promotional materials, Folder: Immunization, Box 32, Collection JC-DPS: Records of the Domestic Policy Staff, Jimmy Carter Library. 15 HEW Press Release, Secretary Califano's Address to the Second National Immunization Conference, 4/6/77, Folder: Immunization, Box 32, Collection JC-DPS: Records of the Domestic Policy Staff, Jimmy Carter Library. 16 Senator Dale Bumpers (AR), Congressional Record, Washington, DC. 17 Ibid., S1661. 129 the Senate for added funding for proven childhood vaccines, above the Ford administration's $13 million per year, but he stre ssed the need for an initiative that would be guided by federal government but carried out by both health workers and legions of volunteers. The Carter administ ration hewed to Bumpers' vi sion; as Califano described the initiative on the day he announc ed it to a gathering of public health officials, it \"is a campaign that must be waged with the will of our citizens, not the dollars of our treasury.\" 18 That will was mustered in large part by massive outreach on the part of HEW officials, including Califano. The final Immuni zation Initiative, as approved by Congress, directed HEW to \"stimulate immunization act ion\"; required the federal Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to administer grants to states to purchase vaccines and run clinics; and contracted the Na tional League of Nursing, with Betty Bumpers as chair, to mobilize and coordinate volunt eers. As the campaign got underway, Califano called and wrote directly to governors, labor leaders, publishers, heads of Fortune 500 companies, and television executives, urging them to e ducate constituents, employees, readers, and viewers of the importance of vaccination. The agency followed up by providing sample publications to print and dist ribute: \"(Name), (title) is coordinating the company's participation in the Immunizat ion Initiative. He urges that all employees check their records to make sure their children are fully protected,\" stated one sample press release sent to major employers by HEW. In response to Califano's direct pleas to leaders in several industries, network execu tives ran television spots feat uring Star Wars characters R2D2 and C3P0 and children's show host Captain Kangaroo enc ouraging immunization; 18 HEW Press Release, Secretary Califano's Address to the Second National Immunization Conference. 130 The National Football League made the campaign the focus of its public service announcements; and advice columnist Dear Abby implored her followers to protect their children with vaccines.19 Governors of the states without any immunization laws agreed, at Califano's direct urging, to put such laws on the books, and states with existing laws took steps to close loopholes and step up enforcement. But to truly keep costs low, and the imprint of federal government faint, the administration sought a campaign waged, like Arka nsas's, at the community level. \"If we can tap the deep well-spri ng of American idealism and draw upon America's notable tradition of voluntarism, then this immunization campaign can stand as a bright example, not of government helping people, but of people helping themselves,\" Califano told doctors and health officials gathered at the Second National I mmunization Conference, shortly after the campaign was announced. The administration's appeal to Americans' \"tradition of voluntarism\" reflected a set of commonly held beliefs and was calculate d to take advantage of nationwide social trends. Immunization education \"must take pla ce at the grassroots level, because that's where the people's attitudes and values are embedded,\" expounded a Johns Hopkins University professor at a national meeting of vaccine experts in 1976.20 Indeed, many specific groups served by HEW's policies and programs were already directly engaged in the social movements of the seventies, or ganizing, for example, to demand rights and 19 Abigail Van Buren, \"Immunizations Are Vital to Public Health,\" Chicago Tribune , January 26, 1978, A4. 20 Materials from National Immunization Conference held at NIH, November 12-14, 1976, Folder: Immunization, Box 32, Collection JC-DPS: Records of the Domestic Policy Staff, Jimmy Carter Library. 131 protections for the disable d, women, gays, and children.21 In its outreach efforts, the agency worked to turn this trend to its adva ntage. In letters and brochures sent out to local PTAs, women's clubs, chapters of the Red Cross, the National League for Nursing, and other community groups, HEW called on communities to form Immunization Action Committees. The brochures, with titles such as \"A Call to Acti on\" and \"Immunization Action Plan,\" laid out precisely how to wa ge a community-based campaign: \"set goals, recommend policies and procedures, initiate lo cal action...and make su re that things get done.\" The brochures suggested that committ ees meet with newspaper editors, hold fundraisers, give presentations to school groups and medical societies, and approach schools and doctors' offices to review records, identify children in need of vaccines, and directly contact their parents. But the agency warned would-be organizers to consult their local health department first: \"It is vital th at the health professionals be aware of your plans,\" the brochures stressed.22 The campaign would be a grassroots one, the administration seemed to be saying, even if its objective was to conform to a mandate from on high. In repeated interviews, including a televi sion interview with Barbara Walters in 1978, the Carters stressed a mantra of personal responsibility with respect to addressing domestic policy concerns, incl uding low immunization rates. \"We have tried to cure the social ills with massive government programs, [but] we've never been able to do that,\" the First Lady told viewers. \"I don't think government can solve all the problems. So I'm 21 A broad overview of the social movements of the 1970s and their context is given in Peter N.

Ms. Shirley Gomes of Boston wr ote the First Lady that th e Junior Women's Clubs of Massachusetts had voted Chil dhood Immunization as their stat e project. Mrs. Edward Dewey of Orlando wrote of her State Aux iliary Board's plans to highlight childhood immunization in their education programs . And countless others described local voluntary groups, education activities, and ar ticles authored, e xpressing thanks to Rosalynn, who was often put forth as the public face of the initiative, for highlighting an important cause in need of attention.24 Given the public skepticism that emerge d following the swine flu debacle in late 1976, immunization should have been a t ough sell in early 1977. But crafting a nationwide initiative that l acked the imprint of big gove rnment helped the Carter administration distance itself from the pr evious administration' s disgraced campaign. \"No nationwide campaign comparable to last year's swine flu vaccination program is planned,\" administration officials told the Associated Press, in what appears to have been a deliberate exaggera tion of the truth; a nationwide campaign was planned, albeit planned to take the form of a multitude of local campaigns. 25 The Carter program's relationship with the failed swine flu program was not one of simple rejection, however: Califano and 23 Film, ABC News Special: A Conversation with the Carters, December 14, 1978, Jimmy Carter Library. 24 Letters to First Lady Rosalynn Carter, Folder: Children - Immunization Correspondence,1/79, Box 7, Collection JC-FL: Records of the First Lady's Office, Jimmy Carter Library. 25 Associated Press, \"HEW Plan s Drive to Inoculate Children,\" Chicago Tribune , April 5, 1977, 10. 133 others pointed out that the childhood immuni zation initiative offered an opportunity to \"turn the swine flu machine\"\u2014that is, the dist ribution networks and state health offices mobilized to distribute and administer sw ine flu vaccine\u2014into \"a positive effort on behalf of children.\"26 The massive amount earmarked for the swine flu campaign positioned the Carter administration to demonstrate that they could do much more\u2014namely, vaccinate millions of children against known threats\u2014with far less money. The swine flu campaign, administered through the CDC, had also begun to mobilize a network of volunteers to drum up support for swine flu vaccination in the summer of 1976. Earlier that same year, Betty Bumpers ha d led the National League for Nursing in a move to launch a national immunizati on promotion campaign, but the effort was abandoned when state health officials turned their attention to swin e flu instead. For the Carter administration, the two pools of mob ilized volunteers amounted to a tremendous, ready resource. To the further advantage of the Carter initiative, the need for a nationwide push for immunization was made starkly appare nt in early 1977, as school-based measles outbreaks made headlines across the U.S. 27 Indeed, state leaders who had readily agreed to Califano's request that they tighten laws and step up enforcement likely complied less out of solidarity with the administration than out of fear of spread ing measles outbreaks. As the Carter vaccine initiative was taki ng shape, local governm ents were already beginning to exercise the enfor cement of often vague laws, most dating to the late sixties 26 Note from Kathy Cade to Rosalynn Carter, Folder : Children's Immunization Program, 2/77-12/78 [1], Box 7, Collection JC-FL: Records of the Fi rst Lady's Office, Jimmy Carter Library. 27 Vernon Thompson, \"Red Measles Ou tbreak Alarms Health Officials,\" The Washington Post , February 5, 1977, B7. 134 and early seventies, requiring children to be vaccinated befo re attending school. In March of 1977, Los Angeles County schools, responding to an outbreak of 1,416 measles cases and working in cooperation with the county he alth department, announced that as many as 50,000 unimmunized children in the district would be barred from school if not vaccinated by May 2.28 On the morning of May 3, in an unprecedented move, the district turned away more than 23,000 still-unvacci nated students when they showed up for class.29 Other districts followed the California county's lead in a nationwide crackdown that was bolstered by the national campaign. Pare nts in Chicago were told to keep their kids home from school if they weren't vaccinated by fall; Washington, D.C. area schools suspended thousands of students for showi ng up without their shots; and even rural Watertown, New York, suspended 56 students, including 5 kindergartners, for failing to rack up all of their required vaccines. 30 Throughout that spring, media outlets across the U.S. cooperated with the federal initiati ve's mandate: when not reporting on measles outbreaks or suspensions, papers publicized the dates and times of public immunization clinics, at which children were vaccinated not just against measles, but against all six targeted diseases. Eighteen months into the campaign, Calif ano and Rosalynn Carter addressed a conference held to thank many of the state health and edu cation officials and volunteers 28 Harry Nelson, \"Measles Ultimatum: L.A.

Califano announced that thanks to the initiative (he gave no credit to the pressure exerted by the measles outbreaks), 23 states had updated and strengthened their immuniza tion laws, adding new vaccines, such as those against rubella and mumps, to existing laws, for example, or expanding laws to apply to children in all grades in public and private schools. Thirty-one states had pledged to begin enforcing laws requiring children to be immunized before entering school, and 37 had undertaken review of all sc hool records to identify children who had \"slipped through the net.\" To state immuni zation rates rapidly approaching 90%, Califano attributed a 53% decline in measles cases, a 21% drop in mumps, a 13% decline in diphtheria, and an 11% drop in rubella.31 But the program's success was also measure d, critically, in dollars, and attributed to widespread cooperation acro ss all sectors of society. As Califano put it: \"We doubt, in the 70s, that the Postal Service can deliver a le tter in five days, and our doubt is too often justified. So it gives me great pleasure ... to talk about a government program that...is achieving what it set out to do, a program that has drawn the best of the voluntary sector of the states, of the cities, of our health syst ems, of our school systems, and of our federal system.... For an investment of only 3 million Federal dollars in polio vaccine over the past year, we saved the American p ublic $262 million....For $2.1 million spent by the government for rubella immunizations this pa st year, we believe we've saved $16 million in health care and other costs that would have been required had we not acted.\" 32 The 31 Remarks by Secretary Califano, Co nference on Immunization Held D ecember 12, 1978, Folder: Children - Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) Conference-Childhood Immunization, 12/12/78, Box 7, Collection JC-FL: Records of the First Lady's Office Jimmy Carter Library. 32 Ibid. 136 message was clear: vaccines were chea p, they prevented disease, and by taking responsibility and working in partnership w ith government and the private sector, the American public could tackle communicable diseases and the to ll they took on the nation's economy. Eradication to Epidemic The Carter administration's immunization initiative ha d such a pronounced effect on immunization rates and disease incidence that in the fall of 1978\u2014on the heels of the World Health Organization's announcement th at its coordinated vaccination campaign had effectively eradicated smallpox worl dwide\u2014Califano announced yet another goal, this one revived from a decade before: the eradication of measles from the U.S. The Carter administration's measles eradication effort combined disease surveillance and response measures with immunization promo tion activities, which included enforcing school entry laws and making the measles vaccin e available to all citiz ens, free of charge, at local health departments. By 1980, 96% of all children entering school for the first time were immunized against measles. In 1981, the year Carter left offi ce, there were just over 2,600 measles cases, an all-time low that le d public health officials to wax optimistic about the prospect of eradication within a year. Measles continued to dec line, to just under 1,500 cas es in 1983\u2014but the trend was short-lived. 33 By the end of the eighties, meas les had joined a list of resurgent infectious diseases that included tubercul osis, rubella, syphilis, and gonorrhea, among 33 Philip Ties Measles Epidemic to Breakdown in Health System,\" New York Times , January 9, 1991, A17. 137 others.34 Beginning in 1989, a series of measles outbreaks struck cities across the U.S., causing a total of 18,000 cases that year a nd over 27,000 the following year, in addition to hundreds of deaths.35 The epidemic disproportionately st ruck minorities in inner cities, and in particular struck the very young: in 1990, roughly half the measles cases recorded across the nation occurred in ch ildren under the age of five.36 The outbreaks disheartened health officials, who in early 1989\u2014just prio r to the start of th e epidemic\u2014had revised federal vaccination recommendations to reco mmend two (instead of one) measles shots before the age of 15 months. The revisi ons had stemmed from observations that throughout the eighties, persistent measle s cases had occurred among unvaccinated infants and schoolchildren who had r eceived just one dose of vaccine. But the measles epidemic of 1989-1991 indi cated that revised recommendations alone were insufficient to stop the spread of the disease. When a federal vaccine advisory panel studied the outbreaks at the behest of the Public Health Service, the resulting Measles White Paper contained much farther-reaching conclusions and recommendations. The panel wrote that alt hough measles immunization levels were close to 100% by the time children entered school, the epidemic was driven by a widespread failure to immunize children at the appropr iate age\u2014namely, before the age of two. A number of factors contributed to this failure: the lack of a nationally coordinated system to promote, monitor, and ensure immunizati on, and a host of health care system barriers, 34 Lisa Belkin, \"A Resurgence of Plagues and Pestilences of Yesteryear,\" New York Times , January 19, 1992, E4. 35 \"Current Trends Measles - United States 1990,\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 40, no. 22 (1991): 369-372. 36 Ibid. 138 including doctors who failed to encourage immunization at routine appointments, a dearth of public clinics a nd personnel, inconvenient clinic hours, and rules requiring physical exams, doctor referrals, or enrollment in well-baby programs prior to getting a vaccine. The measles epidemic was thus an indication of larger problems with the delivery of health care across th e nation, in the panel's opinion. 37 \"We also think there is some acute deterioration of the health care sy stem, and we fear that this\"\u2014that is, the recent measles epidemic\u2014\"may be a warning flag for other problems to come,\" National Vaccine Program Office head Kenneth Bart told the New York Times on the release of the panel's findings. 38 The measles epidemic thus granted health officials an opportunity to highlight fissures in the nation's health care syst em, and indeed many took advantage of the outbreaks to blame the Republican administrations of George Bush and Ronald Reagan for shortchanging public health programs throughout the eighties.39 But in the early nineties, health officials were not alone in pointing out the cracks in the nation's health care systems, both public and private. As in th e years leading up to Carter's election, the perilous state of health care\u2014the high cost of services, the large number of uninsured, the shortcomings of private insurance plan s\u2014was frequent headline news. In 1991, U.S. News and World Report called American health care \"scandalous\" for its failure to safeguard health and protect families from economic ruin, despite billions spent on 37 National Vaccine Advisory Committee, \"The Measles Epidemic: The Problems, Barriers, and Recommendations,\" Journal of the American Medical Association 266, no. 11 (1991): 1547-1552. 38 Hilts, \"Panel Ties Measles Epidemic to Breakdown in Health System.\" 39 \"The Shame of Measles,\" New York Times , May 22, 1990, A26. 139 insurance and services.40 Time magazine declared the nation' s health care in \"critical condition,\" citing prices in defiance of supply and demand and millions of employed uninsured.41 Time announced health care the new \"litmu s test of American politics,\" and indeed it topped the list of issues of major concern to American voters in the 1992 election, helping to sweep Demo crat Bill Clinton into the presidency late that year.42 Clinton's Childhood Immunization Initiative Like Carter, Clinton took office in the midst of a severe economic downturn and a federal budget crisis\u2014factors that prompted Carter to comment in early 1993 that Clinton was \"inheriting more problems than any other president in my memory.\"43 Clinton, like Carter before him, identified the nation's br oken health care system as a critical factor driving the country's economic woes. Since the 1970s, millions had been added to the ranks of those lacking health insurance, and health care sp ending had continued to climb as a fraction of family income and gross national product. By early 1993, more than 37 million Americans had no health insurance, health care spending totaled 12.3% of the GNP, and the inflation of health care prices was far outpacing inflation of other goods and services. On the campaign trail, Clint on promised a comprehe nsive overhaul that 40 Susan Dentzer and Dorian Friedman, \"America's Scandalous Health Care,\" U.S. News and World Report , March 12, 1990, 24-28,30. 41 Janice Castro, \"American Health Care Condition: Critical,\" November 25, 1991. 42 Theda Skocpol, Boomerang: Clinton's Health Security Effort and the Turn against Government in U.S. Politics (New York: W.W.

When Clinton took office in January 1993, he acknowledged that health reform was going to be a formidable task, but it was one that, according to the polls, the majority of Americans strongly supported: one survey revealed that 75% of Americans were willing to pay higher taxes in orde r to improve access to health care. 44 Although Clinton had initially promised a health care reform pl an within his first hundred days in office, a week after his inauguration he announced that his health care task force, headed by his wife, Hillary Clinton, would unveil a plan in May.45 In the meantime, he announced before a joint session of Congress in Febr uary, his administration would face its top priority: the recession. He announced plans for immediate measures to tackle the budget deficit and jumpstart the economy by creati ng jobs, cutting back on government \"waste\" and spending, and switching \"the balan ce in the budget from consumption to investment.\"46 Despite the slightly delayed timetable for health reform, Clinton' speech emphasized the centrality of health reform to any plan for an economic turnaround. He listed the toll that health care costs would take by the new millennium, when they were projected to swallow up 20% of the average American's income a nd account for half of the growth in the nation's deficit. \"All of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail 44 Hart and Teeter Research, \"NBC News/Wa ll Street Journal Poll,\" January, 1993. 45 Dana Priest, \"Clinton Names Wife to Head Health Panel,\" The Washington Post , January 26, 1993, A1. 46 William J. Clinton, Address before a Joint Session of Congress on Administration Goals, February 17, 1993, The American Presiden cy Project, University of California, Santa Barbara. 141 unless we also take this y ear, not next year...bold steps to reform our health care system,\" he told the nation. \"Reducing health care costs can liberat e literally hundreds of billions of dollars for new investment in growth and jobs.\" The nation faced an imperative for reform and recovery, and bot h would begin, he continued, with an immediate investment in the health of ch ildren. \"Each day we delay really making a commitment to our children carries a dear cost ,\" the President stated. \"Half of the 2-year- olds in this country today don't receive th e immunizations they need against deadly diseases. Our plan will provide them for ever y eligible child. And we know now that we will save $10 later for every $1 we spend by eliminating preventable childhood diseases. That's a good investment no matter how you me asure it,\" said C linton, citing a dollar figure that had been widely quoted by health officials during the m easles epidemic of two years before. 47 The seeds for what would come to be called the Childhood Immunization Initiative had germinated during the 1992 campaign, but were initially sown by the persistent measles outbreaks of the eightie s. In the aftermath of the 1989-1991 measles epidemic, states had informed the CDC that in order to stay abreast of immunization targets in the future, they needed not just a steady vaccine supply (during the measles epidemic, some clinics had run dry following unanticipated demand fo r shots), but also a total of 5,000 additional outreach workers and nurses to educate th e public\u2014particularly those in low income and minority communities\u2014and administer vaccines. Clinton campaign strategists took note of this figur e and placed immunization on a list of short- term public health stimulus measures to pot entially move on in a new administration. An 47 Ibid. 142 immunization initiative offered an opportunity fo r jobs creation, in their view, in addition to future cost savings. Strategists and subs equent advisors also saw an immunization initiative as a potentially cheap and polit ically popular move. \"Some funds will be required for vaccine itself,\" noted presid ential advisors Ruth Katz and Tim Westmoreland. \"This will, however, be a relati vely small portion of the spending because for these hard to reach children, most of the cost is in actually getting them in for immunization shots and making return visits for boosters.\" Katz and Westmoreland also pointed out that under the pr evious administration, childhood immunization legislation was authorized \"without dissent.\" 48 In the days leading up to Clinton's speech before Congress, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala request ed permission to begin drafting childhood immunization legislation, urgi ng the president to move quick ly to introduce a bill. She outlined the political benefits of passing such legislation, tying an immunization initiative to the broader goal of overall reform: \"Thi s initiative is ...both a first phase of your overall plan to reform the American health care system and a free-standing effort aimed at addressing a fundamental matter of public health safety for all Americans,\" she wrote to the President. \"It reflects two promises made during the 1992 Pres idential campaign: to assure all children access to pr eventive health services; and to control drug prices which now are escalating at three tim es the rate of inflation.\"49 Three days later, the Secretary 48 Memo from Ruth Katz and Tim Westmoreland, To Josh Steiner 12/9/92, Folder 15, Box 204, White House Health Care Interdepartmental Working Group - Participants Working Papers, William J. Clinton Presidential Library. 49 Memorandum to the President, 2/7/93, Folder 7, Box 14, Domestic Policy Council, Rasco Subject File, William J. Clinton Presidential Library. 143 sent the President a second memo identifying the five key components of the proposed bill. The initiative would lower the cost of vaccines, educate the public about vaccination, increase opportunities for people to get vacc inated, fund research in new and improved vaccines, and establish a computerized tracki ng system to monitor children's vaccination status nationwide. Unlike the Carter initiati ve, the Clinton plan was aimed at immunizing preschoolers. In an echo of the Carter plan, it aimed to immunize 90% of them, this time within three years, and to establish a perm anent system that would ensure the routine vaccination of all infants in the future. On April 1, 1993, Clinton submitted the Comprehensive Child Immunization Act of 1993 to Congress. The bill addressed the obj ectives outlined earlier by Shalala, and it proposed to meet two of them\u2014lowering the co st of vaccine and increasing opportunities for people to get vaccinated\u2014by instituti ng a universal purchase program and by reinstating the National Vaccine Injury Co mpensation Program. Created by an expired 1986 law passed in response to controversy over side effects linked to pertussis vaccination, the compensation program provided remuneration to families with children injured by vaccines, thereby removing th e financial burden of liability from manufacturers. Under the universal purchase program, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be authorized to negotiate with and purchase from pharmaceutical companies enough vaccines to m eet the needs of all children in the country and distribute them to public and privat e providers, so that a ll children could be fully vaccinated at little to no charge; the most a doctor or other provider could charge would be a federally determined administrativ e fee. Administration officials anticipated that universal purchase would be the toughest sell in the Imm unization Act, but it served 144 as an opportunity to set a critical preced ent (the administration planned to make immunization a mandated benefit under health reform), and as a key litmus test of support for a bigger government role in health care purchasing.50 Indeed, one cabinet member called the Act the \"lynchpin\" of the administration's campaign for health reform. 51 But if the initiative was a litmus test, th e results did not bode well. No sooner was the proposal announced than manufacturer s began voicing strong opposition to the universal purchase component, arguing that it would cut into revenues that were crucial for research and development on new and im proved vaccines. Universal purchase \"would just kill innovation,\" a vice president of the Pharmaceuti cal Manufacturers Association told the New York Times .52 Clinton officials struck back by arguing that the price of vaccines had become an insurmountable hur dle for many families\u2014and their target diseases an economic burden for the country. In a speech outside the Arlington, Va. county health department, Clinton told the story of Rodney Miller, whose hospital bills for meningitis\u2014a disease that could be prevented with a new $20 vaccine\u2014totaled more than $46,000. \"American taxpayers are getting h it with ten dollars in avoidable health care costs for every one do llar we could spend on i mmunization,\" Clinton said.53 50 Ibid. 51 Memo from Kevin Thurm to Christine Varney, Re Childhood Immunization Initiative, 3/21/93, Folder 8, Box 14, Domestic Policy Council, Rasco Subject File, William J.

Clinton Presidential Library. 145 Throughout the late winter and early spri ng of 1993, the President was active and visible in promoting the initiative, often in terms that lay the blame for low vaccination rates at the feet of greedy pharmaceutical companies. Vaccine prices, sa id Clinton, were rising at six times the rate of inflation, while pharmaceutical companies were spending a billion more each year to advertise and lobby than to develop new drugs. The prices of some vaccines had risen well over 1,000 percent in the previous decade.54 And while some states had succeeded in past years in contracting with drug companies to buy vaccines at federal discount rates (allow able under the 1962 Vaccination Assistance Act), in recent years, the industr y had refused to negotiate. \"Our message to the drug companies today is: Change your priorities. Y ou're not going to prof it at the expense of our children. These practices must stop,\" Clin ton said before the cr owd of reporters and health officials in Arlington.55 The message had traction, ma king headlines across the U.S. the following day. \"Clinton Knocks Drug Prices,\" read the cover of the Chicago Sun-Times .56 \"Clinton Calls Pharmacy Prices Shocking,\" announced the front page of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer .57 Newspapers widely reported figures cited by Clinton: that a full course of vaccines now cost nearly $250, up from less than $10 a decade earlier.58 Blaming drug company 54 Summary, Comprehensive Childhood Immunization Ac t of 1993, Folder 6, Box 14, Domestic Policy Council, Rasco Subject File, William J.

Skyrocketing health care costs had already incurred national outrage, with poll after poll revealing that Americans believed the costs of health care were too high.59 Compared to most other health care commodities, vaccines were cheap, but they provided the administration with a clear example of a set of health care prices that could be controll ed with government inte rvention. A lifetime of protection against six or more infectious diseases might cost well over $200 at the pediatrician's office, but public clinics were ab le to offer the same protection for less than half that price, in large part by negotia ting bulk discounts with vaccine manufacturers. Such discounts were attracti ng ever greater numbers to pub lic clinics, administration officials said, putting added pressure on an overburdened system. \"We need to stop pediatricians from having to send their patient s into already overcr owded public clinics,\" said CDC director David Satc her at one press conference; it was an anecdote that many cabinet members and aides would echo throughout the spring of 1993. 60 The unnecessarily high price of vaccines, and the sp illover of patients from private into public facilities, offered the administration two comp elling pieces of evidence that the private system was, in the words of one aide, \"unraveling.\"61 Clinton officials often repeated another piece of evidence during what would be a three-month push to move the immunizati on act through Congress. It was \"ironic,\" 59 Robert Samuelson, \"Nationalize Health Care,\" Newsweek , October 26, 1992, 50. 60 Federal News Service, News Conference Transcrip t: Vaccines for Children Program, 7/19/94, Folder 8, Box 33, Domestic Policy Council, Rasco Subject File, William J.

Clinton Presidential Library. 147 Clinton said, that the U.S. \"develops and pr oduces the majority of the world's vaccines\" but was the only industrialized nation that fail ed to guarantee those very vaccines for all of its children.62 The President, First Lady, and cabinet members told reporters that in the Western hemisphere, only Haiti and Bolivia ha d preschool immunizatio n rates lower than that of the U.S., and Shalala called affordable vaccines \"a tenet of all civilized nations\" that the U.S. was failing to embrace.63 A former chair of the Children's Defense Fund (CDF), a group that lobbied for children's intere sts in the capitol, Shalala was perhaps the staunchest supporter of this view and her c onnections to the orga nization appeared to have direct bearing on the content of the immunization act and the discourse used to promote it. In the eighties, CDF had launche d an effort to promote childhood vaccination, and during the measles epidemic of 1989-1991, the organization had conducted a nationwide survey of community health center s that revealed a s hortage of government funded vaccines.64 In the early nineties, the fund lo bbied Congress to increase funding for federal vaccine purchasing.65 With Shalala appointed to Clinton's cabinet in 1993, the organization's position was direc tly reflected in the Secretar y's proposed legislation. Sara Rosenbaum, director of the Fund's health divisi on, also served as an advisor to Clinton domestic policy staff. The Fund promoted v accines as a basic right of children\u2014a right that government should secure much as it did the rights to clean water and education. \"We don't means-test the right to public edu cation, to clean air or clean water,\" Shalala 62 Statement of the President, Arlington County Department of Human Services. 63 Memo from Donna Shalala to the President, 2/7/93, Folder 7, Box 14, Domestic Policy Council, Rasco Subject File, William J.

Such comparisons dated back to the late eighties, however; and they were often coupled with direct or indirect condemnations of U.S. social policy as unc ivilized. Indeed, it was during the measles epidemic that health officials began to point out that the U.S.'s immunization rate was worse than that of nearly every Latin American nation.68 \"Third World Rate Seen in the New York Area,\" proclaimed the head line of a front-page article in the New York Times Metro section, which went on to point out that when it came to preschool children, Grenada, Uganda, Mexico, Algeria, and El Salvador all had significantly higher immunization rates than New York City.69 \"The U.S. is failing a basic test of civilized societies,\" stated the paper's editorial boar d, criticizing government for failing to ensure the immunization of the nation's children.70 66 Robert Pear, \"Clinton, in Compromise, Will Cut Parts of Childhood Vaccine Plan,\" New York Times , May 5, 1993, A1, A20. 67 Memorandum for the President, Legislative Initiative to Comprehensively Address the Nation's Childhood Immunization Crisis, 2/7/93, Folder 7, Box 14, Domestic Policy Council, Rasco Subject File, William J.

But when newspaper editors, politicians, and laypeople were moved to compare America's health policy to that of \"civili zed\"\u2014or \"uncivilized\"\u2014nations, the impulse also had subtler and sometimes more insidious origins. If Americans in the late seventies had a renewed focus on internal affairs follo wing the country's arduous withdrawal from the Vietnam War, Americans in the nineties were increasingly preoccupied with the perceived globalization of media, technology, the economy, and even disease. As Clinton put it in his inaugural addre ss: \"There is no longer a cl ear division between what is foreign and what is domestic. The world economy, the world environment, the world AIDS crisis, the world arms race: they affect us all.\"72 In the U.S., the emergence of 71 Jay P. Sanford et al., \"The Ch ildren's Vaccine Initiative: Achievin g the Vision,\" (Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1993). (Electronic book.) 72 William J. Clinton, Inaugural Address, January 20, 1993, The American Presid ency Project, University of California, Santa Barbara. 150 AIDS, the reemergence of tuberculosis among poor and homeless populations in New York, outbreaks of malaria among refugees in California and North Carolina, and the epidemic of measles, previously seen at highe r rates in Latin America than in the U.S., all brought the globalization of di sease in particular into stark relief. Such episodes highlighted the U.S.'s poor performance in the provision of health care to its citizens, and also reflected moral panic concerning the pe rceived threat posed by the disease-breeding proclivities of predominantly poor, non- white nations. When H illary Rodham Clinton solicited letters from the public on the nation' s health care system in the spring of 1993, many reflected the notion that the country's fail ure to secure the health of its citizens was a sign that it was headed toward \"uncivilized\" disease and decrepitude. \"The business of health care is not compatible with the public need for services th at a civilized nation requires,\" wrote one citizen. Health care reform is crucial \"if the streets of America are not to become like Calcutta,\" wrote another. 73 Clinton's Comprehensive Childhood I mmunization Act, as introduced to Congress on the first of Apr il, was a $1.1 billion program th at would have vaccinated every child, expanded clinic sites and hours, educated the public, i nvested in research, and established a computerized system to keep track of all children's shots. Half of the requested amount\u2014about $500 million a year\u2014w ould have gone toward providing free vaccines to every child, and it was this aspect of the bill that attracted the most attention and controversy. Newspaper reporters had no trouble locating doctors and other health experts who opposed the plan, claiming that cost was not the number one barrier 73 Letters to the First Lady, Folder 6, Box 358, White House Health Care Interdepartmental Working Group, Participants Working Papers, Ira Magazi ner, William J.

Everett Koop (who served under Ronald Reagan) denounced th e plan as an attempt to treat \"the symptoms without trying to cu re the disease.\" Koop pointed ou t that a number of states had universal purchase programs in effect, and that at 63 percent, their preschool immunization rates were only marginally bette r than the 58 percent coverage in states without such programs.75 Initially, many of the bill's foes were pr edictable along party lines and interests, foreshadowing the fate that awaited the admi nistration's larger plans for health reform. Republican members of Congress argued that parental ignorance was a bigger problem than cost, pointing out immunization rates we re lowest among the poor, who already had access to free vaccines through Medicaid.76 Drug companies argued that universal purchase would use taxpayer dollars to vacc inate children in wealthy, insured families.77 Increasingly, Democrats also spoke out ag ainst the proposal; at a hearing, Senator Edward Kennedy pointed out that free vaccin es had done little to raise immunization rates when England had trie d the approach in the 1970s.78 Facing resistance from 74 Amy Goldstein and Spencer Rich, \"Health Ex perts Skeptical About Immunization Plan,\" The Washington Post , April 2, 1993, B1. 75 C. Everett Koop, \"In the Dark About Shots,\" The Washington Post , February 10, 1993, A21. 76 \"The Drive to Vaccinate,\" The Washington Post , May 3, 1993, A18. 77 Spencer Rich, \"Childhood Vaccines Pr ogram Cut Back by Administration,\" The Washington Post , May 6, 1993, A25. 78 Jason DeParle, \"With Shots, It's Not Only About Costs, but Stories,\" New York Times , May 16, 1993, E18. 152 congressional Republicans throughout April, House and Senate leaders worked out a compromise with the administration: to pres erve the other compone nts of the bill, the administration agreed to replace the universal purchase plan with a program that would provide vaccines for all Native American child ren, as well as children without insurance, those covered by Medicaid, and those whose insurance didn't cover vaccines. Ultimately, the Childhood Immunization Initiative was pass ed as part of the 1993 budget bill. Under the title Vaccines for Children, the modified program authorized the federal government to purchase enough vaccine to provide immunizati ons at no cost to th ese select groups of children. The program made federally purchased vaccines available to private physicians in every state. It also guaranteed states th e ability to purchase vaccines directly from manufacturers at federally negotiated pri ces, thereby securing them the option of establishing state-based universal purchase programs at their discretion. (Whereas a handful of states had succe ssfully implemented such programs in the 1970s and 1980s, states that had attempted to establish similar programs in the early 1990s had been rebuffed by pharmaceutical companies who began refusing to sell vaccines to states at the federally negotiated rates.) During the 1996 re-election campaign, Clint on staffers compiled a long list of health care measures passed during Clint on's first term; the Vaccines for Children program was high on the list. By then, 75% of two-year-olds were fully immunized, and more than 90% of the toddlers had at l east one dose of all of the recommended vaccines\u2014a \"historic high\" that surpassed the president's 1993 goals and that was touted, along with equivalent vaccination rates across ch ildren of all racial and ethnic groups, as one of the administration's major accomplishments. But Republicans and the media were 153 reluctant to credit the Clinton program. \"Immunization of Children Rises Slightly,\" announced a headline in the New York Times on the Childhood Immunization Initiative's progress.79 And during the partisan, polarized debates over health care reform, which the Clinton administration failed to enact, Republicans argued that immunization rates had risen through the nineties not b ecause of Clinton, but because of the steps taken by Bush officials in response to the measle s epidemics that struck in 1989.80 Immunization and Political Values Both Carter and Clinton's immunization initiatives served their respective administrations as political tools as we ll as instruments of reform. Despite both originating with moderate southern Democrat s moved to tackle the nation's health care woes, however, the two Presiden tial initiatives reflected funda mentally different beliefs about the barriers to universal vaccination as well as the appropriate role of government in the delivery and management of health car e. Each initiative's form and content also reflected the very different political, economic , social, and cultural context into which it was introduced. The prevailing views of the U.S. health ca re system and its most urgent failings informed the shape that the Carter initiative t ook in the seventies and the distinctly different shape that Clinton's initiative t ook in the nineties. In the seventies, as sociologist Paul Starr and ot hers have described, lawmak ers and experts were most 79 James Bennett, \"Immunization of Children Rises Slightly,\" New York Times , July 24, 1997, B8. 80 Peter Baker and Judith Havemann, \"Child Immunizations Rise Sharply, U.S. Says,\" The Washington Post, July 27, 1997, A16. 154 concerned over the excesses of the health care system.81 As political scientists Kant Patel and Mark Rushefsky note in their analysis of U.S. health care policy, from the 1940s through the 1960s, policies had be en designed to address shor tages in the health care system; the result, by the 1970s, was too mu ch: too much technology, too many hospitals with too many beds, too many physicians, and a glut of goods, services, and providers that (contrary to the classi cal economic model of supply a nd demand) drove prices up, not down, as it encouraged profligat e use of tests and treatments. 82 Applying this perception of excess to the problem of low v accination rates that th e U.S. faced in the mid-seventies meant that the problem was not pe rceived as one of a shortage of vaccines, but rather as one of people not making enough use of them. In the same way that the health care industry as a whole was engaged in a wide-scale effort to encourage the use of excess hospital beds and new technologies (w hile government, meanwhile, bemoaned the industry's lack of efficiency), the Carter in itiative was conceived as an effort to get people to avail themselves of the new and effective vaccines that medicine now had to offer. In the seventies, many of the reco mmended vaccines were indeed still relatively new: new measles and mumps vaccines had been licensed at the turn of the decade, and the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine was new as of 1971. Although the health care system could have been characterized by excess in the nineties, as well, this was not the prevai ling view, according to Patel and Rushefsky. During the Reagan administrati on, federal health care measur es often took the form of 81 Starr, The Social Transformation of American Medicine , 379-381. 82 Kant Patel and Mark E. Rushefsky, Health Care Politics and Policy in America , 3rd ed. (Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, 2006), 45. 155 cuts; preventive health program funding wa s trimmed and Medicare reimbursement rates were reduced, among other measures, all in effort s to contain the rising costs of the health care system. In the interest of reducing the scale of federal government involvement in health (and other social services), states and local governments were granted more spending discretion. But despite deep cuts, health care costs, in cluding the cost of Medicare, continued to clim b through the early nineties.83 By then, inequality, not excess, was viewed by many health officials an d health policy experts as the fundamental failing of the health care system, according to Patel and Rushefsky. Thirty-seven million were uninsured by the time Clinton ran for office, and even among the insured, lack of regulation led to uneven coverage. The measle s epidemic of 1989 revealed not only that the poor, Hispanics, and African Americans were not being served by the health care system, but also that the insured were not being served; the Measles White paper, for example, attributed the epidemic, in part, to the fact that less than half of conventional health plans covered the cost of vaccination.84 By the nineties, that is, the predominant view of the health care system that took shape among many health officials was that it was unjust, its doors closed to minorities, the poor, and increasingly, the middle class. In large part, the Clinton initia tive was shaped in response to this view: by attempting to secure free vaccine for every child, the initia tive was an attempt to address the failure of the private system to make affordable vaccine s available. By allotting funds to hire more health care workers and extend clinic hour s (which it succeeded in doing), and by 83 Ibid. 84 National Vaccine Advisory Committee, \"The Measles Epidemic: The Problems, Barriers, and Recommendations.\" 156 attempting to establish a system to track the immunization status of every child (which it didn't succeed in doing) the initiative also sought to decrease health care access differentials across lines of class and race. Whereas Carter's initiative was designed to encourage communities to take advantage of ex isting resources, the Clinton initiative, by contrast, was characterized primarily by an ai m to increase and redistribute resources; both approaches were responses to their po litical allies' dominant conceptions of the heath care systems in their times. Despite their apparent agreement that he alth care was a \"Democratic issue,\" as Clinton pollster Stanley Greenberg called it, Cl inton and Carter appro ached the politics of health care in ways that also reflected dis tinct political preoccupations, priorities, and values. Both took office in the midst of severe economic downturns, and both were compelled to address the nation's economy as a whole before offering proposals on reforming health care. Clinton, however, kept health care at the top of his agenda, even while introducing stimulus measures to re juvenate the economy. Carter, by contrast, believed that comprehensive reform would have to wait until the economy had substantially recovered; his stalling eventually frustrated and alienated many in his own party. 85 Whereas Clinton lost no opportunity to draw out the link between the failing economy and the broken down heath care system, Carter was far more tentative regarding the promise of health reform. Instead, he followed the counsel of his advisor Peter Bourne, who urged him to tell the public that national hea lth insurance would not be a panacea, and that there were a number of other ways\u2014childhood immunization among 85 Starr, The Social Transformation of American Medicine , 412-413. 157 them\u2014to improve health and lower costs \"w ithout massive new federal expenditures.\"86 Carter's immunization initiative is a prime example of the embodiment of this view. The gap between Carter and Clinton's po litical values became starkly evident during one month in the spring of 1993. As Clinton was attempting to push his immunization initiative\u2014reple te with universal purchas e provision\u2014through Congress, Carter was promoting immuniza tion in his own way, with st ar power and volunteers in his home state of Georgia. In April of that spring, Carter's Atlant a Project, a non-profit effort dedicated to improving quality of life for urban Atlantans, recruited 7,000 volunteers to knock on 200,000 doors to encourage parents to bring their children in for free shots at immunization drives held across the city. The project was funded by corporate donors; administered vaccines already on hand at state and local health departments; and promised volunteers and v accinees an audience with pop star Michael Jackson at the end of the campaign.87 By May, as the Clinton administration was announcing its compromise on the universa l purchase provision, the Atlanta Project announced that it had immunized 17,000 ch ildren, surpassing its goal of 10,000. \"We have to say, too, that we hope President Bill Clinton was watching what happened here,\" wrote the editorial board of the Atlanta Journal Constitution . \"If he was, and if he understands it, he may not feel so bad about having to drop his proposal to spend more than a billion dollars in non-existent federal money for mass free immunization.\"88 86 Memo from Peter Bourne to Hamilton Jordan, Kennedy and Health Policy, 1/28/79, Folder HE, Box HE- 10, Jimmy Carter Library. 87 \"Atlanta Project Pulled It Off,\" Atlanta Journal-Constitution , May 5, A12. 88 \"How Help Immunization,\" Atlanta Journal-Constitution , May 5, 1993, A14. 158 The immunization initiatives of Carter and Clinton also suggest two distinct views on citizenship, or, more specifica lly, health citizenship, the combination of health-related rights granted by the state and related re sponsibilities assumed by its inhabitants.89 Both administrations saw health citizenship as encompassing a balance of rights and responsibilities on the pa rt of citizens, but when it cam e to immunization in particular, they weighed these out rather differently. To the Carter admini stration, immunization was first and foremost a duty of citizenship; to the Clinton administration, it was a right of citizenship. In crafting the administration's message on health inflation, Carter's chief domestic policy advisor Stu Eizenstat urged an emphasis on personal responsibility\u2014the same tactic the administration had employed in the area of energy policy. \"There is no health inflation policy we can develop that would do more good than sensible living by the American people,\" said Eizenstat. \"The American people should reduce their intake of alcohol and tobacco; they should get more ex ercise and drive more safely; they should have their children immunized; and they should seek early care for pregnancy, hypertension, and other conditions.\"90 If health care prices were high, that is, it was up to individual Americans to take steps to avoid paying such pr ices. Government would help, but responsibility lay ultimately with each individual citizen. The Clinton administration adopted a very different position. The administration's view was epitomized by the argument, adopted from the Children's Defense Fund and articulated most often by Secretary Shalala, that vaccinations were, like clean water and 89 Porter, Health, Civilization, and the State , 57. 90 Memo from Stu Eizenstat to Jody Powell, 2/28/77, Folder: HE 1/20/77-7/22/77, Folder: HE 7/1/77- 1/20/81, White House Central File, Jimmy Carter Library. 159 education, fundamental rights that the stat e had a duty to provide to all children, regardless of family income. When me mbers of Congress denounced the Childhood Immunization Act for creating a new entitleme nt in the midst of a budget crisis, some suggested adding a mechanism to ensure that only needy children\u2014not all children\u2014obtained free vaccine. Shalala responded that vaccinations should be treated no differently than other basic, agreed-upon rights of every child, such as access to an education. When it came to matters of health, the Clinton administration (in 1993, at least) espoused the belief that citizens could not fu lfill their individual responsibilities unless the state fulfilled its obligations; under Carter , citizens were urged, first and foremost, to act responsibly in the interest of the state. These distinct views are indicative of personal differences and differences in political values, but they also reflect differences in the overarching social and political contexts into which the Carter and Clinton initiatives were introduced. With respect to vaccine-relate d events, Carter took office on the tails of the swine flu fiasco, a \"big government\" effo rt that ended in embarrassment for Congress and the Ford administration; Carter follo wed with a \"small government\" approach to encouraging vaccination. Clinton, by contrast, took office in the wake of the measles epidemic, during which Democrats and health officials loudly voiced frustration over the Bush administration's unwillingness to enforce federal leadership to stem the spread of infection. During the height of the epidemic, Bush told parents that vaccines were available, and that it was up to them to ensu re their children were properly immunized. 91 91 Ann Devroy, \"Bush Announces New Push to Improve Vaccination Programs,\" The Washington Post , June 14, 1991, A17. 160 Democrats, public health officials a nd lay observers responded by demanding government intervention to control vaccine pr ices and improve access to vaccines. Johns Hopkins University vaccine expert D.A. Hende rson attributed the epid emic to \"dangerous complacency\" on the part of the federal government.92 Senator Dale Bumpers (still in office) called for more federal dollars for immunization to expand clinic capacity and reach out to parents.93 Parents themselves called the pric e of measles shots an \"outrage\" and a \"disgrace.\"94 Clinton responded to these calls by lifting a pointed finger at drug companies and offering a big government, t op-down solution to the problem of low immunization rates. A broader set of issues and events ar e also reflected in each President's immunization promotion efforts. Taking office in the mid 1970s, with apartheid in South Africa and the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and dictatorial regimes in Argentina and Chile a constant theme of current events, Carter had placed the defense of human rights at the center of his foreign pol icy agenda; his domes tic agenda, in turn, often framed health care as a rights issue.95 When Carter announced the U.S.'s participation in the Interna tional Year of the Child in 1979, he explained the country's participation as a matter of human rights, ur ging that the U.S. c ould do better by its 10 million children who had never been to a doc tor, and the 25 million who had never been 92 Susan Okie, \"Vaccination Record in U.S. Falls Sharply,\" The Washington Post , March 24, 1991, A1. 93 Devroy, \"Bush Announces New Push to Improve Vaccination Programs.\" 94 Mary G.

Framing medical care, including immunization, as a right of children (a position cr itically distinct from frami ng it as a right of citizens) meshed with the \"generalization of rights\" that occurred in the early to mid seventies, in which movement upon movement advocated for the rights of \"women, children, prisoners, students, tenants, gays, Chicanos , native Americans, and welfare clients.\" 97 The subsequent \"generalization of doubt\" that spread in the late seventies refers to growing popular skepticism that social services, including he alth services, were either useful or effective; as Starr points out, so cial services were increasingly regarded as potential means of social control. Whether intentional or not, th e Carter's immunization initiative likely avoided this taint in part by vi rtue of its deliberate guise of a \"grassroots\" endeavor. The promotion of Clinton's initiative, meanwhile, reflected a different set of national preoccupations\u2014specifically, the promis e of genetic engineering and the specter of emerging and re-emerging infections. In 1986, the Food and Drug Administration had approved the first genetically engineered vaccine, against hepatitis B virus.98 The vaccine debuted with much fanfare, making headlines across the nation; scientists predicted\u2014and 96 Office of the White House Press Secretary, Re marks of the President Upon Announcing U.S. Participation in the International Year of the Child, 6/28/78, Folder: Children - IYC, Box 7, Collection JC- FL: Records of the First Lady's Office, Jimmy Carter Library. 97 Starr, The Social Transformation of American Medicine , 388. 98 Philip Boffey, \"U.S. Approves a Genetically Altered Vaccine,\" New York Times , July 24, 1986, A1. 162 newspapers reported\u2014that the successful deployment of the technology behind the hepatitis B vaccine opened the door for the development of a host of vaccines against incorrigible infections, including HIV and malaria. 99 The promise of new, safer vaccines held profound meaning in the early nineties: co ncerns about the safety of the whole-cell diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine, which had been linked to severe side effects and infant deaths, had led to a loss of popular fait h in traditional vaccine technologies in the early eighties. At the same time, the emerge nce and re-emergence of a host of infectious diseases\u2014paired with the discove ries that infectious agents were at the route of some cancers and ulcers, conditions previously thought to be incommunicable\u2014led to a national preoccupation with deadly infections , including AIDS, ebola, and tuberculosis, in the early nineties. The New York Times announced that the nineties were witnessing a \"resurgence of plagues and pestilences of yesteryear.\"100 The bestselling authors of books including The Hot Zone and The Coming Plague both capitalized on and drove the cultural obsession.101 The Clinton administration's rhet oric emphasized the promise of vaccines to combat deadly infect ions and the pride that the U.S. should take in its role in vaccine research and development. \"It's a mi racle of our system and our ingenuity that we can prevent the worst infectious diseases of children with vaccines,\" said Clinton.102 99 Nell Henderson, \"Genetically Engine ered Vaccine Approve d for Human Use,\" The Washington Post , July 24, 1986, A9. 100 Belkin, \"A Resurgence of Plagues and Pestilences of Yesteryear.\" 101 Laurie Garrett, The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World out of Balance (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1994); Richard Preston, The Hot Zone , 1st ed.

Clinton Presidential Library. 163 All that was necessary to meet the current scourge of infec tions were policies to ensure the bounties of American technol ogy were accessible to every ch ild in the country. In the administration's conception of health citizensh ip, that technology was the health right of every child citizen. In his analysis of the politics of vaccination, historian James Colgrove argues that over the course of the twentieth century, the prevailing explanati on as to why parents did not have their children vaccinated shifte d: prior to 1950, he writes, doctors, health officials, and lawmakers saw parental ignor ance as the key reason for low immunization rates; after 1950, low immunizati on rates were more likely to be explained as a failure of the health care system.103 Considering the Carter and Clin ton vaccination in itiatives side by side, however, reveals that this trans ition took place more slowly than Colgrove suggests. It also demonstrates that parental ignorance (a nd its correlate, parental or personal responsibility) is laden with significant mean ing in a nation seemingly intransigent on the question of national health care. During Carter's presidency, failings of th e health care system were a concern vis- a-vis low immunization rates, but the predominant discourse at the time held parents culpable. Educational materials printed by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare attributed low immunization rates to \"parental negligence,\" \"oversight,\" and \"misunderstanding.\" 104 In an editorial on i mmunization written for The Washington Post , 103 Colgrove, State of Immunity: The Politics of Vaccination in Twentieth-Century America , 11. 104 \"Feature\", not dated, Folder: Immunization, Box 32, Collection JC-DPS: Records of the Domestic Policy Staff, Jimmy Carter Library. 164 Rosalynn Carter lamented the \"laissez- faire attitude of many parents.\"105 In an article for Parents magazine, Califano called immuniza tion \"the job of every parent.\"106 Many members of the public agreed with this a ssessment: \"Place the blame where it belongs: on the neglectful, careless, t houghtless parent,\" wrote one Los Angeles Times reader in a letter to the editor.107 Of course, not every American agr eed that it was solely the parent's responsibility to ensure every child was im munized. \"We work hard to maintain a 97% immunization level in a rura l county, but can do it only th rough free clinics,\" said Marthella McLarnan, a nurse in Mt. Ver non, Ohio, in a letter to Rosalynn Carter.108 But even this request for the federal government to play a greater role in ensuring the widespread vaccination of childre n adhered to the widely accepted principle that personal (or in this case community) responsibility was the key to keeping immunization rates high. During the Clinton presidency, individua ls on occasion voiced the opinion that parents were to blame for not vaccinating th eir children, but condemnations of the health care system, which had gained currency during the measles epidemic, were far more common\u2014at least in the beginning. When Clin ton unveiled his vaccine initiative, many commentators agreed\u2014initially, at least\u2014 that it was a good idea for government to provide all children with free vaccines, precisely because inadequacies of the health care 105 Rosalynn Carter, Notes, 12/78, Folder: Children - Immunization, Box 7, Collection JC-FL, Records of the First Lady's Office, Jimmy Carter Library. 106 Califano, \"Immunizing Our Children.\" 107 Helen H. Doane, \"Letters to the Times,\" Los Angeles Times , May 11, 1977, E4. 108 Letter from Mrs James Conard McLarnan to Rosalynn Carter, 5/22/79, Folder WE 1, Box 138, Collection JC-FL, Records of the First Lady's Office, Jimmy Carter Library. 165 system appeared to be at the root of the problem. \"Most developed countries have a national system for child imm unization. We have only a loos e patchwork of private and public care, with uncertain funding,\" lamented one newspaper columnist.109 Even vaccine manufacturer Merck (trying to deflect attention away from outrage over high drug prices) took up the cry that the system was the probl em. \"The real barriers to preschool child immunization are failures in the health care delivery system,\" a company spokesperson told The Washington Post .110 But the consensus that placed blame on the health care system was fleeting\u2014and in retrospect seems a harbinger of what was to come for the overall Clinton health reform plan. As Clinton backed down on universal pu rchase, even the media seemed to change its mind about how much\u2014and what type\u2014of government intervention was need to boost immunization rates. When the Clinton proposal was first announced, the editorial board of The Washington Post supported the idea of universal purchase.111 In May, the board changed its position, positing that federa l funds would be better spent on education and outreach.112 The New York Times appeared to agree, r unning in mid-May a feature that highlighted the stories of poor families that failed to vaccinate their children not because of a lack of free vaccine, but because of the complexities of living in poverty.113 Clinton's own message would gr adually shift, too, in partic ular as his administration 109 Teepen, \"A Shot at Helping All Our Kids.\" 110 Spencer Rich and Ann Devroy, \"Pre sident Blasts Cost of Vaccines,\" The Washington Post , February 13, 1993, A1. 111 Editorial, \"Immunity for the Children,\" The Washington Post , February 4, 1993, A20. 112 Editorial, \"The Drive to Vaccinate,\" The Washington Post , May 3, 1993, A18. 113 DeParle, \"With Shots, It's Not Only About Costs, but Stories.\" 166 crafted its approach to its next domestic ag enda item, welfare reform. Clinton's welfare reform plan\u2014which Congress did enact in 1996\u2014espoused a strong emphasis on personal responsibility. \"Governments don't rais e children, parents do,\" was the message the President put forth, in the aftermath of the administration's failure to pass health care reform. Contrary to Colgrove's assessment, the notion that parents were to blame for their children's wellbeing\u2014including their i mmunization status\u2014was still firmly in place at the end of the twentieth century. 114 Conclusion The Carter and Clinton immunization initia tives were crafted with ostensibly similar objectives: the immunizatio n of 90% of the target po pulation (schoolchildren in the Carter years; preschoolers in the Clinton years) and the establishment of a system to ensure the continued immunization of all children, all in the in terest of reining in health care costs. Both initiatives also served as prototypes, in practice or in theory, that demonstrated potential roles the federal governme nt could play in the provision of health services to its citizens. Desp ite sharing similar objectives and originating in Democratic administrations, however, the prototypes were hardly congruous, as Carter's grassroots- type campaign now stands in sharp c ontrast to Clinton's top-down vision. This distinction between the two initiativ es speaks in part to differing political philosophies on the part of the two presidents. It also speaks to a larger, enduring debate over the appropriate balance of individual rights and res ponsibilities in the continuing 114 Talking points, 1/5/94, Folder 8, Box 13, Domestic Policy Council, Reed Welfare Reform Subject File, William J. Clinton Presidential Library. 167 endeavor to make health services affordable and accessible to all individual Americans, as well as the nation as a whole. To a degr ee, each president's respective emphasis was informed by the particular moment in whic h he introduced his initiative. The swine flu campaign, inflation, and concern for human rights abroad were all reflected in the Carter initiative, just as the measle s epidemic, the budget crisis, an d a resurgence of infectious diseases were all reflected in the Clinton in itiative. Ultimately, both initiatives achieved their stated goals; both have also had lasting effects on imm unization status in the U.S., by making vaccines widely available and the laws encouraging their use widely enforceable. However, between the two, only Cl inton's initiative did not survive in its original form, as it evolved from a progr am that would have made vaccination a guaranteed entitlement of all children to one that circumscribed the federal government's role in immunization provision much more narrowly. The political and popular response to both initiatives provides ev idence in support of an abidi ng American preference for emphasis on personal responsibility in health car e, even when it comes to the health care of the country's youngest citizens. 168 Chapter 4 A Mother's Responsibility Women and Vaccine Skepticism When Health, Education, and Welfare Secretary Joseph Califano and First Lady Rosalynn Carter addressed the National C onference on Immunizati on in late 1978, they congratulated health workers and volunteers on their progress vaccinating the nation's children. As they urged the crowd to keep wo rking toward the goal of immunizing ninety percent of all children, they stressed the need to reach out to parent s and inform them of the importance of vaccination. This outreach was largely targeted at a particular type of parent: mothers. Califano promised conferen ce attendees that they'd be discussing new plans to reach out to the mothers of the th ree million children born each year, to ensure that they received the message that vaccine s were vital for their children's health. \"Mothers need to know the crucial importance of shots early in thei r children's lives,\" Mrs. Carter told the crowd.1 Political discourse concerning vaccinati on from the 1970s through the early 1990s often emphasized parental responsibility for children's immunization status, as described in the previous chapter. However, in th e multiple vaccine-related discourses from the early part of this period\u2014in political as well as popular and scientific discourses\u2014 references to parental respons ibility were often understood as references to maternal responsibility. In the 1970s, polit icians, health professionals, and even parents themselves often saw mothers as the party primarily re sponsible for obtaining needed vaccines for 1 HEW Immunization Conference - Mrs. Carter's Re marks, December 12, 1978 , Folder: Children, HEW Conference, Childhood Immunization, Box 7, Collection JC-FL, Jimmy Carter Library. 169 children. The Carter administration's campa ign to immunize children thus targeted mothers, and indeed relied to a great exte nt on women volunteers to reach out to these mothers. The centrality of maternal engageme nt to federal immunization goals in this period had direct relevance for the vaccine cr isis that unfolded in the 1980s, a connection that has yet to be explored. If the Carter administration oversaw an expansion of federal support for immunization\u2014maternal involvement notwith standing\u2014the subsequent era, marked by the 1980 election of Ronald Regan, saw a contr action of this support. Reagan's promises of a new era of small government meant that federal immuniza tion funds were in constant threat of being slashed.2 A few years into his presidency, however, a coalition (albeit a tenuous one) of doctors, pharmaceutical compan ies, and consumers effectively lobbied for a new law that would increase government oversight of vaccine safety. That law, the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compen sation Act, was the pet project of a newly formed consumer group that called itsel f Dissatisfied Parents Together, or DPT, after the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus shot whose adverse effects came under nationwide scrutiny in the early 1980s.3 As its name suggests, DPT was comprised of mothers and fathers; however, the group's membership wa s predominantly female from its inception, and its members often fashioned themselves as mothers who, through the suffering of their vaccine-injured children, were vi ctims of the medical-industrial complex. 4 Mothers 2 United States Senate Committ ee on Labor and Human Resources, Immunization and Preventive Medicine (Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1982). 3 In this chapter, I use \"DPT\" to refer to the parent s group and \"DPT vaccine\" to refer to the immunization. 4 A.S. Relman, \"The New Medical-Industrial Complex,\" New England Journal of Medicine 303, no. 17 (1980): 963-970. 170 emerged as the most prominent leaders in the nationwide movement that DPT gave shape to, and they grounded their claims for a greater role in scie ntific and medical decision- making with respect to vaccinati on in their right, as mothers, to information relevant to their children's health, and in their expert ise as their children's primary caregivers. The story of DPT has been analyzed in brief by historians Robert Johnston and James Colgrove.5 To date, however, historians have ye t to fully consider the complexity of factors that affected the timing and content of mothers' critiques of vaccination in this period, or the factors that drove these mothers to voice their concerns and begin organizing for political changes affecting vaccination. This chap ter thus examines women's conceptions of vaccines and vaccine policies from the 1970s through the 1980s, in order to bridge the history of vaccines at this time to the history of women's health. Because changing vaccination policies focu sed on children in this period, mothers comprised the majority of lay women commenting on vaccines. During the 1970s, mothers were widely viewed as the party ultimately responsible for children's vaccination; during the same period, mothers (and grandmothers) expressed an ambivalence toward vaccines and vaccinat ion norms. Vaccination-related discourse at this time brought into relief tensions crea ted by second-wave feminism and the changing social, economic, and civic roles of women, pa rticularly mothers. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, women who began to openly voi ce criticisms of vaccines and vaccine policies employed a rhetoric th at reflected the influence of the New Left movements of the 1960s and 1970s, including the anti-medica lization, women's health, and health 5 See Colgrove, State of Immunity: The Politics of Vaccination in Twentieth-Century 263-266. 171 consumer movements. They were angered by what they perceived as the medical profession's tight control over knowledge relevant to their ch ildren's well being; they were also angered by what they construed as government laxity in the arena of vaccine safety. They complained that doctors and heal th officials lied to, belittled, and misled patients; that the doctors were male and the pa tients were female in the vast majority of accounts from this period ties thes e grievances to the feminist critique of medicine of the previous decade. However, despite the initial, arguably liber al, demands of these vaccine critics in the 1980s\u2014that is, for increased governmen t protection against vaccine risks\u2014the movement's conservative sociopolitical c limate in the late 1970s and early 1980s informed its frustration with \"Soviet-style\" i mmunization laws; this, in turn, helped form the basis for its argument for greater freedom of choice in health care decision making in the mid-1980s. While the argument for greate r independence in health care decision making can be viewed in part as a legacy of the women's heal th movement, in this case it also reflected a persistent American impatie nce for big-government health care policies. Vaccine skepticism in this period thus reflec ts a far more complex set of ideological influences than previous histories of vacci nation resistance, which have emphasized the importance of libertarian critics, have sugge sted. At the end of th e twentieth century, by contrast, vaccination criticism layered c onservative political ethics atop New Left critiques of social hegemonies. 172 A Mother's Responsibility The Children's Immunization Initiative that got underway in early 1977 was, at the grassroots level, carried out largel y by women and mothers\u2014members of local women's clubs, nursing league s, and parent-teacher asso ciations\u2014who volunteered to reach out to other mothers and urge them to vaccinate their children. The Carter campaign's dependence on women volunteers wa s, by then, a well-established tradition in the history of immunization promo tion. From the 1940s through the 1960s, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, th e national organization that supported care for polio victims and research on potential cu res and vaccines, relied heavily on its tens of thousands of volunteers to raise funds a nd promote its cause. It was the foundation's bevy of women volunteers who raised money fo r polio treatment and vaccine research and helped carry out vaccine field trials in the 1940s and 1950s, imprinting upon the American memory the legendary image of mothers marching en masse, posters and collection cans in hand. They were wome n in hospital boards and Parent-Teacher Associations with \"both the time and the pass ion to work against childhood disease,\" as well as a culturally informed sense that, as mo thers, involvement in such causes was their civic duty.6 Mothers did not always excl usively comprise vaccinati on-drive volunteers in mid- century; rather, they most often did so when children were the specific target of such campaigns. The Salk and Sabin polio vaccines that came into use in the 1950s and 1960s were administered in the early years not onl y to children, but to citizens of all ages. Capitalizing on postwar patriotism, the polio vaccine campaign rallied more than 90,000 6 Smith, Patenting the Sun: Polio and the Salk Vaccine , 413. 173 men and women volunteers to staff vaccination clinic days; men in short-wave radio equipped vehicles drove the perishable v accine from depots to clinics, while women oversaw the clerical duties necessa ry to vaccinating the population.7 The Carter campaign, which focused exclusively on the vacc ination of children, relied on volunteers in a manner that more closely resembled the ear ly days of the March of Dimes, as well as the statewide vaccination campaign that took pl ace in Arkansas in the early 1970s. At the urging of Betty Bumpers (wife of then-gover nor Dale Bumpers), along with beauty queen Miss Arkansas, mothers in the Arkansas campaign volunteered their time going door to door to spread the word about immunizati on and attending vaccination clinics, where they held children's hands and di stributed candies and balloons.8 In its push to promote immunization, the Arkansas campaign made dire ct appeals to women's sense of duty and potential for fulfillment as mothers: \"Protect these Treasured Moments,\" stated campaign materials that featured a sentimental illustration of an attractive young mother seated in a rocking chair, reading a bed time story to the smiling young s on curled against her breast and doting daughter nestled at her side. In the years preceding th e Carter era campaign, this type of appeal\u2014to a mother's sense of unique responsibility and love for her children\u2014was a popular one not just in Arkansas, but acros s the nation. \"Every mother who loves her children will get them vaccinate d both against rubella and against ordinary measles,\" wrote popular syndicated medical columnist Dr. Walter Alvarez in the Los 7 Gordon Grant, \"Vol unteers Will Help Keep Polio C linics Stocked with Vaccine,\" Los Angeles Times , November 26, 1962, E9. 8 Immunization Project Meeting Agenda, Governor's Mansion, Little Rock, AR, Mar 8, 1973, Folder: Children's Immunization Program, 2/77-12/78 [2], Box 7, Collection JC-FL, Jimmy Carter Presidential Library. 174 Angeles Times in 1972.9 Such appeals speak to tens ions between conceptions of motherhood in post-1960s America described by historian Rebecca Jo Plant; whereas modern motherhood was a private affair, this conception coexisted with a persistent ideology of moral motherhood that impresse d upon mothers a sense of lifelong and exclusive responsibility for th e wellbeing of their children.10 A mother's perceived duty to vaccin ate her children cut in two different directions. For health officials and politicians promoting the cause of vaccination in the 1970s, mothers were often viewed as a ready resource already dedica ted to the cause of protecting their ch ildren. On the other hand, when ch ildren went unvaccinated, mothers were often held culpable and labeled thoughtless, uneducated, and irresponsible.11 The development of a series of measles vacci nes in the early 1960s was followed, in 1966, by the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC's ) announcement of a measles eradication campaign. When measles outbreaks began erup ting across the country a few years later (after a dedicated federal funding program fo r measles vaccination had expired), many in the medical and public health community found fault with mothers: mothers who failed to bring their children to clinics, mothers w ho failed to realize the vaccine was available, and mothers who failed to recognize the new vaccine's importance.12 Mothers were chastised for mistaking measles for simple co lds and for treating it as a \"mild\" infection, something to be gotten over with by \"sending kids down the block to an infected family 9 Walter Alvarez, \"Epidemic of Measles Feared,\" Los Angeles Times , January 6, 1972, F12. 10 Rebecca Jo Plant, Mom: The Transformation of American Motherhood (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2010), 3, 15-16. 11 Ann Landers, \"Ann Landers: Consequences,\" The April 14, 12 Auerbach, \"D.C. Has Rash of 261 Measles Cases.\" 175 to catch it and have done with it.\"13 Health columnist Alvarez was straightforward in placing responsibility and blame on mothers. When measles erupted in Texarkana (a city straddling the Texas-Arkansas border), Alvarez blamed it on \"unwise\" mothers who were \"too poor\" or \"too ignorant\" to vaccinate their children.14 Even when the fault for low vaccination rates was distributed across multip le parties, the responsibility ultimately rested with mothers: \"the unnecessary case of diphtheria, measles, or poliomyelitis may be the responsibility of the state legislatur e that neglected to appropriate the needed funds, the health officer who did not implem ent the program, the medical society that opposed community clinics, the physician who did not immuni ze his patient, the religious views of the family, or the mother who didn' t bother to take her baby for immunization,\" wrote federal immunization scientists in the New England Journal of Medicine .15 It followed, then, that concurrent with the spread and enforcement of school vaccination laws throughout the 1970s, cam e vaccination promotion efforts that specifically targeted mothers. As Washington, D.C. attempted to combat the resurgence of measles that struck the c ity in 1970, health officials th ere implemented a plan to mail immunization reminder notices to mothers thre e months after the hospital birth of their child.16 New York City health officials worked with local hospitals to identify, at birth, mothers without pediatricians, so they could later be visited by representatives from local 13 Editorial, \"Measles' New Muscle,\" Chicago Tribune , August 3, 1971, 10. 14 Walter Alvarez, \"Poverty, Ignorance Halting Vaccination,\" Los Angeles Times , April 19, 1973, G20. 15 D.

When measles struck New Jersey in 1974, st ate health officials asked doctors to cull their files for patients in need of immunizations\u2014and then call their mothers. \"We want those mothers to get their kids to their doctor as soon as possible,\" said New Jersey health officer Martin Goldfield.19 Women generally and mothers in particular have, of course, long been viewed as a gateway to improved children's health. But in the 1960s and 1970s, efforts to encourage mothers to vaccinate their children\u2014either out of a sense of duty or shame\u2014were embedded within larger convers ations about the social and economic roles of women. As medical professionals and health officials de bated, beginning in the late 1960s, whether children should be universal ly vaccinated against measles and mumps, an economic argument in favor of requiring vaccines for children gained currency. While some doctors posited that both diseases were mild, a nd mass vaccination therefore unwarranted (particularly for children unlikely to suffer co mplications), others ar gued that vaccination offered an unprecedented convenience for famili es with two wage earners. When a child comes down with mumps, argued a Washington st ate health official, \"A working mother 17 Michael Stern, \"Immunizations Lag Called Peril in City,\" New York Times , June 17, 1971, 1. 18 Schultz, \"Why Childhood Diseases Are Coming Back.\" 19 \"645 Measles Cases Reported by State,\" New York Times , February 1, 1974, 64. 177 may have to stay home to care for him and more often than not, two to three weeks later, mumps develops in the susceptible siblings and adults in the family with another week or two of family disability.\" The implication of such arguments was that preventing the \"milder\" infections through vaccination had implications for family income, workplace productivity, and, following the argument to its logical conclusion, the economy as a whole. The new vaccines against commonpl ace childhood maladies, fortunately, made the potential loss of income associated with these weeks of disabil ity \"preventable and unnecessary.\" 20 Economic arguments (of a different sort) we re used to sell not only municipalities on the importance of vaccination against the milder infecti ons, but also women themselves. Not only could vaccination pr otect a woman's econo mically productive hours, it could also make\u2014or break\u2014her car eer, noted some vaccination proponents. A 1973 column by Dr. Alvarez promoted the cause of vaccination by telling the tale of a \"very intelligent woman whose very promis ing career as a university professor was stopped\" because she caught rubella, a v accine preventable disease, during her pregnancy. Because of her rube lla infection, her child was born deaf, and her career hopes were dashed as she devoted her time to the care of her deaf child instead of her work.21 Such narratives reflected changing demogr aphic realities as well as social ones: the women's rights movement altered the status and longevity of women in the workplace.22 It also opened the door for more women to enter the professions and the 20 Jones, \"Public Acceptance of Mumps Vaccination.\" 21 Alvarez, \"Poverty, Vaccination.\" 22 Susan Brownmiller, In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution (New York: Dial Press, 1999). 178 workforce generally, with the result that the numbers of women in the workforce began a steady ascent in this period.23 In this context, vaccines agai nst the milder infections were culturally positioned as modern conveniences that prevented children from thwarting women's personal goals or lifestyle choices\u2014much as oral contraceptives did. Over the course of the 1970s, concerns about protecting the productivity of the wage earner became increasingly central to vacc ination debates. Such justifications were not focused exclusively on the economic produc tivity of women, however. When Senator Dale Bumpers made his case for increased federal funding for vaccination programs in 1977, he stressed the need for vaccination programs that served families with two working parents. \"You have to provide clinic hours in the evenings so that working men and women can get their children to the clin ics,\" he said before the Senate in 1977. 24 His comment applied to a particul ar class of parents, as it came amidst an impassioned statement on the failure of vaccination awar eness programs to have any effect on \"the poor people in the inner citi es\" and in \"rural areas.\"25 As measles broke out in several major cities in the early 1970s, health offici als lamented that vaccination campaigns had missed \"Negro\" and \"Latin American\" childr en in urban settings. \"The problem is basically we have not learned how to reach the preschool child in the ghetto,\" said Dr. Alexander Langmuir of the CDC.26 23 Philip Jenkins, Decade of Nightmares: The End of the Sixties and the Making of Eighties America (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), 28-29. 24 Sen.

In Washington, D.C., a 1970 increase in measle s cases was attributed to \"poor mothers\" who didn't visit clinics because they \"have no one to leave ot her children with, or they don't realize measles vaccine is available.\"27 In 1973, lagging immuni zation rates in New York City were attributed to \"poor mother s\" who failed to prioritize vaccines because they were \"struggling to get up the rent money.\"28 Measles outbreaks in New Jersey that same year were attributed to \"poor moth ers...waiting until their children entered school for free inoculations.\"29 This assessment\u2014that vaccination uptake was lowest in low income areas because overburdened, uninformed, and impoverished mothers of color failed to seek free shots for their children\u2014w as not, however, paired with a complete exoneration of white, middle-class mothers. A third explanation popular among vaccine scientists and bureaucrats attributed mothers' failure to vaccinate their children to their age, and not their race or income. \"Today's mothers are in their 20s or early 30s,\" a CDC official told the Washington Post in 1975. \"They don't remember the polio epidemics of the 1940s and 1950s, the pictures of children in iron lungs or the mass closings of swimming pools in summer.\" The front-page artic le featured a large photograph of Karen Pfeffer, a white, middle-class, 22-year-old mother whose daughter Tracy contracted a near-fatal case of whooping cough. \"Whoopi ng cough? Who's ever heard of whooping cough?\" the paper quoted Pfeffer. \"I just didn't realize how se rious it could be.\" 30 27 Auerbach, \"D.C.

The frugal Carter campaign was deeply depe ndent on the voluntary services provided by such women as Connie Jones, Coordinator of Volunteer Services for the Alaska Hospital Auxiliary, Mrs. Ruth Sloate of the Volunteer Clearinghouse of the District of Columbia, Mrs. Virginia Weber of the Florida Federation of Women's Clubs, and the more than 40 other women listed on the campaign's rost er of Lead Voluntary Organizations.31 By the time the Carters entered the White House, however, second-wave feminists had spent several years chipping away at the notion th at volunteerism should be the universally accepted domain of women. At conferences in the early 1970s, the National Organization of Women had taken an offici al position against what they called the exploitative nature of volunteer work.32 Rosalynn Carter\u2014whose high-profile involvement in domestic and foreign affairs and equal partnership with her husband were favorite subjects of news outlets, even as she was ofte n criticized by feminist leaders for lacking an identity separate from her husband\u2014nonetheless champi oned the cause of volunteerism while in the White House.33 When one reporter asked her if it wasn't \"denigrating\" to ask women to engage in important work without pay, Carter acknowledg ed that it wasn't a widely popular cause. \"Voluntarism has a little bit of a bad connotation. I've been trying to say 31 List of Lead Voluntary Organizations, Folder : Children - Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) Conference-Childhood Immunization, 12/12/78, Box 7 (First Lady's Office - Projects Office - Cade Subject File), Collection JC-F L, Jimmy Carter Library. 32 Rhoda Gilinsky, \"Volunteerism and Women: A Status Report,\" New York Times , November 12, 1978, WC16. 33 Diane M.

But I don't think that limits them from doing good things for other people,\" she said.35 Carter's support for voluntarism was just one example of how her political choices sometimes rested uneasily in the shifting landscape of women's social roles. As First Lady, Carter de clined to wear her motherhood on her sleeve, turning down inv itations to chair both the Children's Immunization Initiative and th e International Year of the Child\u2014even as some of her female constituents saw her as uniquely quali fied to support such causes. \"Mrs. Carter, Please use your influence as a concerned moth er and as an intelligent participant in national planning to reinstate money in the budget for vaccines,\" one mother wrote in a letter to the White House.36 Such pleas, and Mrs. Carter's chosen public roles (she advocated strongly for the mentally ill a nd the elderly), map neatly onto Plant's framework of post-1960s motherhood as both a pr ivate affair and just one component of women's multi-faceted lives.37 In Plant's analysis, modern motherhood la rgely (but not completely) supplanted \"moral motherhood,\" a Victorian era relic that conceived of motherhood as an all- 34 Rosalynn Carter, \"The Gift of Giving,\" Good Housekeeping , December, 1978, 28-36. 35 Notes from an interview conducted by Suzanne Wilding, Folder: Suzanne Wilding, Town and Country Magazine Interview with RSC Nove mber 16, 1978, Box 7 (Mary Hoyt's Press Re leases and Speeches Files), Collection JC-FL, Jimmy Carter Library. 36 Letter from Mrs. James Conrad McLarnan to Rosa lynn Carter, 5/22/79, Folder: WE 1, Box 138, Collection JC-FL, Records of the First Lady's Office, Jimmy Carter Library. 37 Plant, Mom: The Transformation of American Motherhood , 3-6, 14-15. 182 encompassing pursuit characterized by suffering and self-sacrifice, and serving as the basis for female citizenship.38 Letters written by mothers to newspaper advice columnist Ann Landers on the subject of vaccines illustra te the persistence of moral conceptions of motherhood into the 1970s. \"Hear tsick Mother,\" whose son suffered permanent hearing loss after a bout of measles, wrote to ask that \"thoughtless, irresponsible\" mothers see to it that their children got vaccinated. \"I am se nding my letter to Ann Landers,\" she wrote, \"because this problem is bigger than our own two children. It involves all children everywhere.\"39 \"Mom Who Cares\" wrote to ask, \"W hy do mothers and fathers who claim they love their children neglec t to have them vaccinated agai nst diseases such as polio, diphtheria, measles and mumps? Don't they re alize they can get these shots free at the county or city health centers?\"40 As their monikers attest , both writers wielded their identity as mothers to legitimize the civic act of chastising other pa rents (of both sexes) for not vaccinating their children. A mother's decision to not vaccinate, as the first mother points out, was, after al l, not a private one, as it held implications for \"children everywhere.\" It was a view that many mo thers appeared to espouse. When the CDC mailed a vaccination survey to Louisiana mothers in 1970, the most common complain mothers jotted on the form was that it listed on ly one child's name, when in fact they had taken all of their children in for shots. Most of these mothers, presumably wishing on some level to be credited for their proper a nd thorough parenting, returned the form to the health officials with unsolicited details on thei r other children's vaccination experiences. 38 Post , June 1, 1976, B4. 183 The decision not to vaccinate one's ch ildren might have stemmed from ignorance or a lack of resources, as the comments of health officials during the measles epidemics suggested. It likely also stemme d, at least in part, from a gr adual erosion of faith in both medical professionals and the products of scie nce, trends that accelerated from the late 1960s through the 1970s.41 The same batch of survey re sponses mentioned above also suggest a direct, if subtle, challenge to th e authority and expertise of the questioning officials. While a few mothers attributed unforeseen powers to childhood vaccines (one mother claimed rubella vaccination had prot ected her daughter from coxsackie virus; another credited vaccination for improving he r son's disposition) such votes of confidence were rare.42 Far more mothers attributed to th e vaccines a host of side effects, many discrediting their doctors' opinions in the process. \"My pediatrician discounted the Rubella [vaccine] as the cause but call it a mo ther's intuition on what I say it definitely had an effect,\" wrote a New Orleans mother of her son's \"totally blocked nose\" and the pins and needles in his arms and legs, wh ich lasted for two weeks after his shot.43 Even more mothers expressed a level of impatience w ith the health officials' questions, tersely complaining, for example, that they had alr eady filled out the form, that their children's names had been misspelled, or that they ha d no way of knowing how the shots affected 41 Starr, The Social Transformation of American Medicine , 379-393. 42 Responses to a survey mailed by the Lousiana State Department of Health, 1970, Boxes 338638 and 338639, Record Group 442, Records of the Immunization Branch, Centers for Disease Control, National Archives and Records Administration, Southeast Region. 43 Ibid. 184 their children. \"Corey is 11 months old a nd cannot communicate,\" wrote one; \"If he did [have discomfort] I don't know because he is too young to tell me,\" wrote another.44 Of course, the survey responders were all mothers who had vaccinated their children. Testimony from mothers who chose not to vaccinate their children in the late 1960s and 1970s is harder to find, but the fact that some mothers made this choice is evident in media coverage. In the late 1970s, lett ers to Landers began to hint at a sense of doubt regarding the need fo r across-the-board immuniza tions against all childhood infections. A mother in Bat on Rouge described with frus tration her sister-in-law's insistence that \"it's much bette r for kids to get all the chil dhood diseases when they are young.\"45 A mother in Champaign, Illinois described her disagreement over vaccination with her sister. \"Mary says she is having her children immunized this week against measles, mumps, rubella and whooping cough. She also mentioned polio. I have not heard of a child getting polio for several years. I thought this disease was conquered. Also, what about the others? Why go to th e trouble if there is no danger?\" she asked.46 That doubt also became perceptible in ma gazines that targeted women, including Good Housekeeping , Ladies Home Journal , Parents , Redbook , and Better Homes and Gardens . Such magazines only infrequently covered the subject of vaccines in the years before 1976, when the threat of swine flu prompted several editors to run reports addressing the question of whether readers (and their children) should seek out flu shots. Coverage of vaccines generally increased sign ificantly in the followi ng years, in direct 44 Ibid. 45 Ann Landers, \"Ann Landers,\" The Washington Post 9, 1979, 46 Ann Landers, \"Ann Landers,\" The Washington Post , November 8, 1977, B7. 185 response to the massive publicity campaign la unched by Califano and the department of Health, Education, and Welfar e. During the campaign, article s urged parents to check their children's vaccination records and consu lt with their family doctors and local health departments, stressed the importance of immunizing children with all of the recommended shots, and borrowed warnings and horror stories directly from HEW brochures.47 But while they served the federally directed cause of vaccination promotion, many such articles also hinted at a rising tide of skepticism among pa rents. \"Misguidedly, some of us fear that vaccines are dangerous; but the minimal risk must be weighed against the much greater benefit, which is disease prevention,\" stated an article in Harper's Bazaar . 48 \"Parents frequently ask whether it's really necessary to immunize their children against measles, rubella, mu mps, and poliomyelitis, as well as against diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus\u2014after all, these illnesses are much less prevalent in recent years,\" wrote pediatrician Morris Wessel in Parents . \"The answer is an unequivocal yes.\"49 Such articles did not directly address the fears and questions of readers; instead they played up the risk of complications linked to vaccine preventable diseases, and urged readers to comply w ith vaccination recommendations. But their references to readers' doubts and fears indica tes the presence of an information gap, or a void, which women, their consciousness raised by the consumer and women's health movements, took note of a nd began to question. 47 See for example Lynne Lamberg, \"Immunization: A Call to Action,\" Better Homes and Gardens , September, 1979, 70; Schildkraut, New \"Immunizations Are Important,\" Parents , December, 1979, 28. 48 Elaine Fein, \"Immunization: Is Your Child Protected?,\" Harper's Bazaar , July, 1979, 75-76. 49 Wessel, \"Immunizations Are Important.\" 186 Questioning Authority The women's health movement, a component of second-wave feminism that emerged in multiple sites across the country in the 1960s, strove to democratize women's health-related knowledge and wrest control of women's health issues from the predominantly male medical profession. As me dical anthropologist Sandra Morgen has noted, at geographically diverse sites, its followers took multifaceted approaches to putting women's health in women's hands.50 They founded clinics, held cervical-self- examination workshops, conducted abortions, and wrote books exposing infractions of the medical profession and instru cting women on how to take charge of their own health. In a few highly visible instan ces, activists focused on exposin g the negative effects of specific drugs commonly prescribed to women, including the bi rth control pill, diethylstilbestrol (DES), and estrogen. Over the course of a decade, their efforts helped bring national attention to the risks of depr ession, blood clots, str oke, and heart attack associated with oral contraceptives; the incr eased risk of endometrial cancer in women who took estrogen for menopause; and the star tling frequency of reproductive cancers in the daughters of women who took DES dur ing pregnancy. The unveiling of such evidence drove feminist demands for informed consent in medical decision making and increased access to information, speci fically through drug package inserts.51 50 Morgen, Into Our Own Hands: The Women's Health Movement in the United States, 1969-1970 . 51 Elizabeth Siegel Watkins, \"Doctor, Are You Trying to Kill Me?

As historian Susan Speaker has shown, the impact of feminist critiques was thus fe lt beyond the arena of women's reproductive health; a general disillusi onment with the pres cribing practices of doctors and growing doubt about the safety of commonly prescribed drugs directly influenced, in her analysis, large-scale rej ection of minor tranqu ilizers in the 1970s. In Speaker's assessment, minor tranquilizers\u2014wide ly prescribed to women, their risks long suppressed\u2014became potent symbols of \"socia l control, big science, and big industry gone wrong....\" For women, what was \"wrong\" with the industry of medicine in particular was that physicians, who were mostly male, \"refused to listen to or believe female patients, withheld knowledge or lied to them, overcharged them, [or] performed unnecessary procedures.\"52 The reach of this general disillusionm ent\u2014which in the critiques listed above, notably emphasized the long-hidden side eff ects of widely prescribed drugs\u2014slowly began to spread to vaccines at the tail end of the 1970s. It was most evident, early on, in the pages of Mothering magazine, a new Colorado-based pu blication devoted to \"natural family living\" and a product of both the wo men's health and environmental movements. At the time, mainstream women' s magazines often ran articles that urged mothers to get their children vaccinated; several, including Good Housekeeping and Better Homes and Gardens , devoted an entire page to a tearsheet parents could use to schedule and record their children's vaccines. Mothering , too, printed a tear shee t on vaccination. This one, 52 Speaker, \"From \"Happiness Pills\" to \"National Nightmare\": Changing Tranquilizers in America, 1955-1980,\" 371-373. 371-73. 188 however, warned mothers to \"be cautious with vaccines.\" It warned t hose allergic to eggs and chickens to avoid measles vaccine, warn ed that vaccinating a child against polio could cause cases of the disease in other family members, and listed encephalitis and death as possible side effects of the pertussi s vaccine. This list of warnings was one small sign representing a much broader crystalliza tion of doubt regarding vaccines that took place at the beginning of the 1980s.53 That the warnings were taken directly from vaccine package inserts, as a note on the bottom of the page indicated, was a direct indication of the influence of the women's health movement, which had fought for such inserts for other drugs a decade before. 54 It was not just the timing of the appe arance of these vaccine doubts that linked their emergence to the feminist and consumer rights movements; they were also bound by their rhetoric. The experience of Peggy O' Mara, the New Mexico mom who joined the editorial staff of Mothering in the late 1970s (after the magazine moved its offices to Santa Fe), illustrates the link. O'Mara said she began questioning vaccination when she became pregnant with her first child in 1973: \"Because I was accustomed to making personal healthcare decisions, it seemed like the obvious thing to do,\" she later told readers.55 Her own questioning\u2014and that of her read ers, who from the late 1970s through the early 1980s sent more letters on vacci nation than any other topic (aside from circumcision)\u2014are the direct result of a broa d based movement that inspired women in 53 Carol Horowitz, \"Immunizations and Informed Consent,\" Mothering , Winter, 1983, 37-41. 54 Watkins, On the Pill: A Social History of Oral Contraceptives, 1950-1970 . 55 Peggy O'Mara, \"Editorial,\" Mothering , Summer, 1996, 25. 189 particular to question the advice and prescr iptions of their doctors\u2014and, in this case, their children's doctors.56 As in the women's health movement\u2014in which Barbara Seaman's The Doctor's Case Against the Pill laid bare the risks of oral c ontraceptives\u2014key expos\u00e9s alerted the public to the sometimes devastating side effects of by-then widely administered pharmaceuticals. The vaccine expos\u00e9s, a 1982 NBC broadcast on side effects connected to the pertussis v accine and the 1985 book A Shot in the Dark , which elaborated on the same subject, presented scientific eviden ce on the vaccine in lay terminology, arguing that the evidence had long been in the po ssession of\u2014and had long been ignored by\u2014the medical profession. Historian Robert Johnst on, who in a 2002 essay analyzed what he called the \"contemporary anti-vaccination m ovement,\" dated the beginning of that movement to the widely viewed 1982 NBC report, \"Vaccine Roulette.\"57 In a footnote, Johnston acknowledged that \"certain comm unities\"\u2014he referred to the readers of Mothering in particular\u2014were skeptical about vaccine s prior to this date. He also pointed out that the movement that emerged in th e 1980s was driven by mo thers, \"the parents most responsible for taking care of children, es pecially disabled ch ildren\"; he signaled that these women were not \"traditional\" moth ers, however, in that they had \"backgrounds in business or the professions .\" Johnston's analysis suggest ed that the movement had only shallow roots in 1982, and while he si gnaled that it was si gnificant that the movement's founding mothers were business or professional women, he stopped short of examining the deeper meanings of this fact. As their own accounts reveal, these 56 Morgen, Into Our Own Hands: The Women's Health Movement in the United States, 1969-1970 . 57 Johnston, \"Contemporary Anti- Vaccination Perspective,\" 263. 190 \"professional\" and \"business\" women were alert to the overarching messages of the women's health movement and to the potential for individual and organized resistance to effect changes in medical practice. Popular concerns about the side effect s and potential hazards of vaccines may have attracted widespread a ttention in the early 1980s, but they were not at all unprecedented. Johnston has described Progressive Era concerns over the risks associated with smallpox vaccination.58 Physician and vaccine chronicl er Paul Offit has detailed in length the episode in which hundreds of Ameri can children were para lyzed or died after receiving a polio vaccine contaminat ed with live virus in the mid 1950s.59 In the 1960s, pharmaceutical company Parke, Davis & C o. pulled a combined diphtheria-tetanus- pertussis-polio vaccine (Quadrigen) from the ma rket after reports of severe side effects, including brain damage.60 And in the 1970s, reports of convulsions, paralysis, and death following DPT vaccination\u2014and attributed to the pertussis, or whooping cough, component of the vaccine\u2014cause d vaccination rates to declin e dramatically in the UK, Sweden, and Japan.61 Even before the mass vaccination program that brought widespread attention to the risks of swine flu vaccin e in 1976, public concern about the potential hazards of vaccination had health officials anticipating the need for revised policies. \"General awareness of vaccine risks has increased rapidly in recent years,\" wrote 58 Johnston, The Radical Middle Class: Populist Democracy and the Question of Capitalism in Progressive Era Portland, Oregon , 177-220. 59 Offit, The Cutter Incident: How America's First Polio Vaccine Led to the Growing Vaccine Crisis . 60 Colgrove, State of Immunity: The Politics of Vaccination in Twentieth-Century America , 210. 61 Jeffrey P.

The hour-long broadcast, which was subse quently excerpted nationwide on the Today show, showed extensive footage of mentally and physically disabled American children whose handicaps were attributed, by parents and docto rs, to the pertussis component of the DPT vaccine. \"The medical establishment\" had been \"aggressive in promoting...the most unstable, least reliable vaccine we give our children,\" said re porter-producer Lea Thompson in her introduction to the report, which informed parents that one in 7,000 children suffered serious advers e effects related to the vacc ine, including high fevers, inconsolable crying, seizures , brain damage, and death.63 In interviews whose content echoed the themes of feminist critiques of medicine, mothers of vaccine-damaged children complained that their doctors hadn't listened to them ; dissident doctors testified that the vaccine was no longer necessary; a nd government scientists suggested federal 62 Memo, Unaddressed from Theodore Cooper, Assistan t Secretary for Health, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, July 1 975, Folder: CDC Liability Proposal, Box 8, Swine Flu Immunization Program Files, Centers for Disease Control, Nationa l Archives and Records Administration, Southeast Region. 63 The risk of severe brain damage or death was much lower but widely disputed; estimates ranged from 1 in 174,000 shots to 1 in 1 million shots. For a summary, see Roy Anderson and Robert May, \"The Logic of Vaccination,\" New Scientist 96, no. 1332 (1982): 410-415. 192 agencies had ignored and suppressed data implicating the vaccine in having caused harm.64 Doctors and scientists were swift and harsh in their response. They called the report imbalanced, distorted, and inaccurate , and accused Thompson of misinterpreting the science and committing \"journalistic malpractice.\"65 In the nationwide panic that ensued, physicians fielded thousands of calls from concerned parents, whom they often labeled \"hysterical\" (a term that would have struck feminists as particularly loaded).66 Thousands of parents also called the D.C. tele vision station to say that they believed their children had been harmed by the vaccine, too.67 Station representatives put a few of the parents in touch with each other, and a ha ndful of them\u2014Kathi Williams, Barbara Loe Fisher, Jane Dooley, Donna Middlehurst, and Middlehurst's husband, Jeffrey Schwartz\u2014 banded together to form an advocacy group they dubbed Dissatisfied Parents Together. The following month, Williams and Marge Grant, one of the mothers who had appeared in \"Vaccine Roulette,\" testified before a Congressional subcommittee. The Senate hearing that took place in May 1982 had origin ally been scheduled to address cuts in federal funds for immunization and strategi es for reaching children who remained unvaccinated in the wake of the Carter-era campaign. Instead the hearing, called by Senator Paula Hawkins of Florida (whose ow n son had contracted polio from the polio 64 Lea Thompson, DPT: Vaccine Roulette (Washington, D.C.: NBC News, April 1982). 65 United States Senate Committ ee on Labor and Human Resources, Immunization and Preventive Medicine , 7. 66 Elizabeth Gonzalez, \"TV Report on DTP Galvanizes U.S. Pediatricians,\" Journal of the American Medical Association 248, no. 1 (1982): 12-23. 67 Donna Hilts, \"The Whooping Cough V accine: A Protector or a Killer?,\" The Washington Post , April 28, 1982, Va2. 193 vaccine), featured extensive testimony by pa rents of vaccine-injured children, health officials, and other parties on the risks of vaccination.68 \"Vaccine Roulette\" and its fallout\u2014incl uding media reports on the vaccine and the parents group, congressional h earings, and the publication of A Shot in the Dark , co- authored by Fisher and inde pendent historian Harris Coul ter\u2014reveal that women's gendered experiences shaped the popular response to pertussis vaccine risks. Thompson, a \"consumer reporter\" for Washington's WTOP-TV who received an award for her reporting from the American Academy of University Women in 1978, did not focus exclusively on women's issues, but she did indicate that her reporting was at times directly shaped by her own experi ences as a woman and a mother. 69 Her report on asbestos-lined hair dryers led to a recall of 12.5 million hair dryers, and her report on nutritive deficiencies in baby formulas (which she took on following the birth of her own child) helped bring about a federal law enforcing routine testing of formula.70 In \"Vaccine Roulette,\" she interviewed male doc tors and health officials who denied the pertussis vaccine's risks, but gave equal time to these with interviews and footage of mothers struggling to care for their severely handicapped children. In several shots, these mothers were seated alongside their husbands , but in each case, the mother was the spokesperson for her child. 68 United States Senate Committ ee on Labor and Human Resources, Immunization and Preventive Medicine . 69 Robert Galano, \"Crusading Camera'd Champions of the Consumer,\" The Washington Post , March 30, 1980, TV3. 70 Susan Okie, \"How Two Angry Mothers Beat Uncle Sam at His Own Game,\" The Washington Post , October 11, 1980, A3. 194 In Thompson's interviews of these mo thers, a common narrative emerged; the same narrative appeared in A Shot in the Dark and other media from this period highlighting the risks of vaccina tion. In these stories, a mother senses that something is wrong with her child, either just before or just after a vaccine is administered; she questions her (nearly always) male doctor and is told not to worry or \"get upset\"; despite this assurance, her child suffers dramatic and irreparable harm; as a result, she is driven to advocate for a change in vaccination po licy. \"These doctors and officials in the government, who keep talking about the benefits and risks of this vaccine, better take fair warning,\" said Janet Ciotoli, a 27-year-old nurse whose son died following his DPT shot. \"My baby may be just another statistic to them , but he was my child and there is nothing more powerful than a mother's fight for her child.\" 71 Janet's fight, which she shared in A Shot in the Dark (the book alternated between persona l stories and detail ed exposition of the scientific studies on pertus sis) consisted of confronti ng her doctor and the coroner, who attributed her son's death to SIDS.72 Janet prevailed in having her son's death attributed to the vaccine; the steps she took to do so were legitimized, in her view, by her identity as a mother. Janet's story\u2014in which she, an educate d, professional woman, took her doctor's medical advice at face value, only to find that this quiescence would cost her her son's life\u2014was one of several in A Shot in the Dark that link the book to a series of popular books published in the late 1970s that chastised organized medi cine for its treatment of 71 Harris L. Coulter and Barbara Loe Fisher, DPT: A Shot in the Dark (New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1985), 13. 72 Janet's last name appears in her 1983 Congressional testimony; in A Shot in the Dark , the women who shared their stories at length were referred to by their first names only and are likewise referred to here. 195 women. The books, including Gena Corea's The Hidden Malpractice , Suzanne Arms' Immaculate Deception , and Gail and Tom Brewers' What Every Pregnant Woman Should Know , largely focused on an earlier stag e of motherhood, namely, pregnancy.73 They argued that the medical establishment had inst illed a sense of fear and powerlessness in women, subjecting them to unnecessary, overmedi calized procedures that posed harm to them and their babies, and that served to ma ke life more convenient for none other than their doctors. (These books were themselves influenced by Our Bodies Ourselves , the lay manual to women's health first published by the Boston Women's Health Course Collective in 1971.74) Women, they argued, were administ ered sedatives and subjected to procedures, such as pubic-hair shaving and fe tal monitoring, without their consent; they were also \"frightened into believing\" that an esthesia and other drugs were necessary for childbirth, and that birth, \"once a natural pr ocess\" must take place in the hospital, among strangers.75 \"I assumed no choices about my bi rth...I thought doctors must know what they're doing,\" recalled one mother after another in Immaculate Deception .76 A few years later, vaccine critics would pi ck up on these themes. \"The public has been intimidated by scare tactics and guilt either to immunize their children or be labeled negligent,\" wrote 73 Suzanne Arms, Immaculate Deception: A New Look at Women and Childbirth in America (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1975); Gail Sforza Brewer and Tom Brewer, What Every Pregnant Woman Should Know: The Truth About Diet and Drugs in Pregnancy (New York: Penguin Books, 1977); Gena Corea, The Hidden Malpractice: How American Medici ne Treats Women as Patients and Professionals (New York: William Morrow and Company, 1977). 74 Boston Women's Health Book Collective, Our Bodies, Ourselves (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973). 75 Arms, Immaculate D eception: A New Look at Women and Childbirth in America , 22,57. 76 Ibid., 58. 196 Maine physician Daniel Lander, who aut hored a 1978 booklet on immunization risks.77 \"I, like so many mothers, lacked the information necessary to even ask intelligent questions...instead, I trusted the experts, \" said Gerri Cohn, whose daughter Traci suffered brain damage subse quent to her DPT vaccine. 78 The (almost exclusively female) authors of the aforementioned volumes focused on the process of reproduction, and usually left off shortly after childbirth, arguing in favor of breastfeeding over formula but ve nturing no further into childrearing. As a result, they rarely, if ever, touched on i mmunization. Their work, however, was related to a separate but contemporaneous body of work that took broader aim at perceived transgressions of the me dical profession and that did specifically critique mass deployment of vaccination as a disease prevention strategy. In Medical Nemesis , historian and philosopher Ivan Illich argued that fact ors other than \"medic al progress\"\u2014including water and sewage treatment, better nutri tion, and sociopolitical equality\u2014were primarily responsible for improvements in health, and that professional medi cine was thus not deserving of the live-saving reputation it was so commonly, and exclusively, accorded. To Illich, the medical profession could duly ac crue only partial credit for the defeat of smallpox through vaccination. In his analysis , the importance of mass vaccination as a medical intervention had been dramatically overstated; deaths due to diphtheria, whooping cough, and measles, he pointed out, declined 90 percent prior to widespread 77 Daniel A. Lander, \"On Immunization,\" Mothering , Fall, 1981, 32-35. 78 Sandra Sugawara, Parents Gr oups Speak out against Multiple DPT Vaccine; Side Effects Blamed for Brain Damage,\" The Washington Post , February 8, 1985, D5. 197 immunization.79 Illich was often cited by physicia n-turned-popular-author Robert Mendelsohn, who became an outspoken and widely quoted critic of v accines in the early 1980s. Mendelsohn, who wrote in his book Male Practice that women were the \"primary victims\" of \"medical and surgical over kill,\" listed vaccines as one of several controversial and risky practices and proce dures women were coerced into accepting for their newborns.80 In his 1979 book Confessions of a Medical Heretic , he questioned the need for vaccines against mumps, measles, and rubella, diseases which, in his view, weren't nearly as severe as smallpox, tetanus, and diphtheria. He pointed to evidence that the diphtheria vaccine was sometimes ineffec tive, and he described the controversy over the safety of pertussis vaccination that wa s, at that point, br ewing only within the profession.81 \"Vaccine Roulette,\" an episode of the Phil Donahue show that aired months later, and A Shot in the Dark all transmitted this notion of medical overkill to a national audience, linking it to a critique of the pert ussis vaccine. All three expos\u00e9s pointed out that whooping cough rarely caused children to di e in the modern era, and that (borrowing Illich's point) the disease had declined significantly prior to widespread vaccination. Both Sweden and West Germany had abandoned th e vaccine over concerns about its side effects, \"Vaccine Roulette\" and A Shot in the Dark reported, and neither country had 79 Ivan Illich, Medical Nemesis: The Expropriation of Health (New York: Pantheon Books, 1976), 16. 80 Robert S. Mendelsohn, Male Practice: How Doctors Manipulate Women (Chicago: Contemporary Books, 1981), 188-191. 81 Robert S. Mendelsohn, Confessions of a Medical Heretic (Chicago: Contemporary Books, 1979), 143- 144. 198 suffered epidemics as a result.82 The widespread attack on pe rtussis vaccination shared this notion and several others with widely read works that had critiqued medicine at the end of the previous decade: not only were some vaccines possibly unnecessary, they were administered by male doctors who failed to listen to their female patients and who deliberately lied and withheld information from th eir patients to serve their own interests. In \"Vaccine Roulette,\" Wisconsin mother Emily Yankovich described her daughter Abra's inability to breathe in the hours after her DPT shot. She recounted taking her blue and trembling daughter to the hospital, and asking the doctor whether the shot could have caused her daughter's condition. \"H e said 'No, she probably was just choking, just take her home and she'll be fine.' Two weeks later she went into a grand mal seizure. She was very near dying,\" Yankovich reca lled. Evelyn Gaugart described taking her daughter Polly in for her DPT shot. \"I says maybe she should not have this shot because it seems to me she's just not quite herself. And he checked her all over and said, 'she looks OK to me' and then he gave her the shot. And the next, following morning, when I was feeding her, she went into a grand mal seizure, which, cause I didn't know what was happening, I thought she was dying in my arms , at that moment.\" After dogged pursuit and countless visits to specia lists, both mothers received conf irmation of what they knew all along, despite their doctors' dismissals: th at their children's symptoms were in fact vaccine related.83 82 Britain, by contrast, faced a pertu ssis outbreak in 1977-1979 that health officials blamed on a vaccination rate that had fallen 50% since 1970. Three deaths and 17 cases of brain damage were attributed to the outbreak. See Anderson and May, \"The Logic of Vaccination.\" 83 Lea Thompson, DPT: Vaccine Roulette. 199 In A Shot in the Dark , women referred to as \"a mother on the mother\" are just a handful of the mothers who r ecounted asking their doctors about their children's high-pitched screaming, high fe vers, and muscular spasms following vaccination, only to be told \"not to worry.\" In each mother's story, the child developed a seizure disorder or brain damage; a few di ed. With their emphasis on the need for mothers to question their doctors' opinions, th e women who shared their stories in the book reflected the influence of feminist and an ti-medicalization critiques of professional medical care. \"We are so conditioned to the id ea that our doctor's word is to be trusted without question that we don't think for ourselves. I am a nurse. I watched my son die that day, and I didn't even know what was happening until it was all over,\" said Janet in A Shot in the Dark . \"If this had not happened to my baby, I would still be part of the uninformed public. I would still be taking my doctor's word as the word of God, like most mothers do.\"84 The women who spoke out against va ccination in this period (fathers spoke only on rare occasion in both \"Vaccine Roulette\" and A Shot in the Dark ; none appeared to critique vaccin es at the 1982 Senate hearings ) frequently saw their doctors' perceived arrogance in distinctly gender ed terms. When Ellen, who described her daughter Sherry's DPT-induced brain damage in A Shot in the Dark , demanded answers to her questions about Sherry's condition, she recalled being \"officially labeled a 'troublemaker' and 'hysterical mother' in on: \"They 84 Coulter and Fisher, DPT: A Shot in the Dark , 9. 200 can be so damn patronizing. You know, pat the li ttle mother on the head and tell her to calm down.\"85 And then there were the mothers who rec ounted being misled: \"I asked the doctor what the odds are of our child having a si milar reaction,\" said Wi sconsin mother Gail Browne, who had heard about severe vaccine-re lated side effects from a friend before taking her son in for his shots. \"He said th at I didn't have anything really to worry about.... Then, he went into convulsions,...and th e doctors told me...it was nothing to be upset about.\"86 Mothers also described anger at not having been informed of vaccination risks: \"Never\u2014and I repeat never\u2014once was I warned of any possible severe neurological injuries occurring from that sh ot,\" said Marge Grant at the 1982 Senate hearings.87 In A Shot in the Dark , Janet and other mothers rep eatedly emphasized that the risks of vaccination\u2014and other forms of medical information\u2014were deliberately withheld from them. When Ellen, fearful that Sherry was no longer mentally alert, took her daughter in for tests, she battled to obtai n the results from her doctor: \"He kept the results from me. Instead he told me not to worry,\" she said.88 Still other mothers blamed not just do ctors but also the government and drug industry, alluding as they did to a large s cale cover-up of the dangers of the by-then widely administered vaccines. (By 1980, upwards of 96 percent of all children entering school were vaccinated against measles, r ubella, polio, diphtheria, pertussis, and 85 Ibid., 40. 86 Lea Thompson, DPT: Vaccine Roulette (NBC News, , 1982). 87 United States Senate Committ ee on Labor and Human Resources, Immunization and Preventive Medicine , 44. 88 Coulter and Fisher, DPT: A Shot in the Dark , 37. 201 tetanus.89) \"It appears to me that the manufact ures [sic] and/or certain government agencies are intentionally withholding v ital information,\" said Wendy Scholl, who testified before Congress in 1983 about her daughter Stacy's measles vaccine-induced paralysis, learning disa bilities, and seizures.90 Senator Hawkins shared this perception of deliberate dissemblance when she asked federa l vaccine officials, \"What symptoms or warning signals should the parents look for fr om the adverse reacti on from the vaccine, which I believe is the secret that has been held from them?\"91 The sense of a conspiracy was only heightened when officials defende d the practice of administering vaccines without informing parents of the risks, as one FDA official did in his interview with television reporter Lea Thompson: \"If we told parents there was a risk of brain damage, there's no question what their response would be,\" he said.92 The benevolent paternalism belied by the o fficial's comment was proof that if patients wanted objective information on medi cal risks, they were going to have to demand it, if not seek it out themselves. As historian Elizabeth Watkins has written, \"informed medical consumerism\" was a \"gui ding principle\" of the women's health movement.93 The women who spoke out against va ccines in the early 1980s followed in this tradition. In Mothering magazine, Carol Horowitz, a he alth educator with a masters 89 United States Senate Committ ee on Labor and Human Resources, Immunization and Preventive Medicine , 4. 90 United States Senate Committ ee on Labor and Human Resources, Task Force Report on Pertussis (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1983), 77. 91 United States Senate Committ ee on Labor and Human Resources, Immunization and Preventive Medicine , 41. 92 Thompson, DPT: Vaccine Roulette . 93 Watkins, The Estrogen Elixir: A History of Ho rmone Replacement Therapy in America , 130. 202 degree in public health from Berkeley, de scribed how she conducted computer-based searches of the medical literature on vacci ne risks for the years 1980 and 1981. \"What is known about vaccines is a whole other story fr om what is told. Health care consumers should insist on reading the package insert s which come with vaccines,\" she wrote.94 Much of the discourse that questioned vacci ne safety demonstrated support for the democratization of medical knowledge, anot her of the women's health movement's guiding principles. At the end of \"Vaccine R oulette,\" vaccine scientist Saul Krugman appeared on screen, saying that convulsions were not a contraindication against DPT vaccination. The camera then cut to reporter Lea Thompson, who read directly from the American Academy of Pediatrics' Redbook entry warning against giving the shot to children who had previously suffered convulsions.95 When the coroner refused to attribute her son's death to DPT vaccination, Janet, in A Shot in the Dark , recounted returning to him with a copy of The Physician's Desk Reference , in which her son's precise condition was described.96 The book concluded with the following admonishment: \"The time has come to be educated about vaccines.\"97 Framing their Demands The effect of the feminist and women's health movements was such that, as Watkins has described, women were, over the course of the 1970s, more and more likely 94 Horowitz, \"Immunizations and Informed Consent.\" 95 Thompson, DPT: Vaccine Roulette . 96 Coulter and Fisher, DPT: A Shot in the Dark , 10. 97 Ibid., 408. 203 to receive information from their doctors re garding the risks and be nefits of their own medical treatments; by then, the expectation that women should participate in their own medical decisions had permeat ed most doctors' offices.98 The late 1970s debate over the risks and benefits of taking estrogen, for ex ample, had focused on the need for women to make an \"informed choice,\" rather than simp ly listening to their doc tor, \"who, after all, does not have to live the woman's life,\" as New York Times writer Jane Brody put it.99 By the end of the 1970s, as a result of the femini st and women's health movements, this type of questioning had become mainstream. In the 1980s, women who expressed concern about vaccine safety mapped this previously self-limited behavior onto their children; many who did so stated that, after all, their children were \"part of them.\"100 And the vaccination of their children di d affect them directly; indeed, many who spoke out against the pertussis vaccine detailed how their lives were irreparably altered by their children's vaccine-related injuries . In \"Vaccine Roulette,\" Gail Br owne described how her son's disabilities had led her and her husband to abandon hopes of another child as they struggled to pay for his extensive care.101 Testifying before Congress, Wendy Scholl described an endless quest for providers a nd financial aid for he r disabled daughter's care, made worse when her husband lost hi s job and their new insurer wouldn't cover their daughter's condition.102 98 Watkins, The Estrogen Elixir: A History of Ho rmone Replacement Therapy in America . 99 Quoted in Ibid., 111. 100 Coulter and Fisher, DPT: A Shot in the Dark , 407. 101 Thompson, DPT: Vaccine Roulette . 102 United States Senate Committ ee on Labor and Human Resources, Task Force Report on Pertussis , 76- 78. 204 Whereas feminists and women's health activists demanded a form of social justice, however, vaccine activists dema nded political justice. DPT, as a group, acknowledged the importance of vaccines and the dangers of vaccine preventable diseases. Instead, they criticized the risk-benef it calculus cited by public health officials, who pointed out that the vaccine might cause a few dozen cases of brain damage, but that the alternative, whooping cough, w ould cause thousands of deat hs each year. \"No parent should be put in the untenable position of ha ving to choose between a bad vaccine and a bad disease,\" DPT founder Barbara Fisher wrote in a letter to the editor of The Washington Post . 103 To the parents of vaccine-injured children, it was unjust that they alone should suffer the high cost of achieving better health for the nation as a whole. \"Did these children, like soldiers, give their li ves so that others might live?\" asked mother Gerri Cohn at a Maryland state hearing on pertussis.104 Because the answer was yes, DPT listed among its demands safer vaccines, more information for parents, better studies of adverse reactions, and justice, in the form of remuneration, for the families of vaccine- injured children. That these parents viewed vaccines as a thre at to their children's health in this period relates to epidemiological and demogr aphic shifts that had occurred over the previous decades. Because of widespread va ccination, pertussis cases had diminished to just a couple thousand cases a year. Given th is figure, many parents who identified with the emerging vaccine-safety movement conclude d that the risk of vaccine-related harm was insupportable. CDC statistics calculated that collapse or convulsions occurred once 103 Barbara Loe Fisher, \"Why Not Use a Safer Vaccine?,\" The Washington Post , May 9, 1988, A14. 104 Elsa Walsh, \"State Defends Vaccine,\" The Washington Post , June 30, 1982, MD6. 205 in every 1,750 shots, and brain dama ge once in every 100,000 to 172,000 shots.105 But as Marge Grant told Senate committee members in a written testim ony, making liberal use of the shift key as she turned an old me dical adage on its head, \"I can tell you most assuredly, WHEN IT HAPPENS TO YOUR CHILD, THERE ARE NO \"BENEFITS\" AND THE RISKS ARE 100 PERCENT!\"106 (The phrase would later become the motto of the parent's group DPT.) The dispute between parents and health o fficials over the appropriate risk-benefit calculation for justifying mass vaccination took place not only in the context of diminishing pertussis disease rates, but also in the context of dimi nishing birth rates, particularly among white, middle-class Amer ican women, who comprised the bulk (but not all) of the vaccine safety movement's me mbers. The value of the individual child to the American family took on a new meaning at this time, epitomized by the emergence of a national obsession with the protection of ch ildren, which historian Philip Jenkins' work has analyzed. With the advent of the child protection movement at the very end of the 1970s, anti-smoking and anti-drug campaigns focused on the sanctity of children and citizens mobilized against a host of perceived social threats to child ren, including not just drugs, but also mass murderers, sexual deviants, cultists, homosexuals, child pornographers, and child abusers. 107 The child protection movement itself was also, to an extent, an outgrowth of feminism; as femi nist writer Susan Brownmiller has documented, 105 United States Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, Immunization and Preventive Medicine , 6. 106 Ibid., 55. 107 Jenkins, Decade of Nightmares: The End of the Sixties and the Making of Eighties America , 256-270. 206 it was feminists who brought th e issue of child abuse to publ ic light, and rape crisis centers founded by feminists that revealed th e extent of sexual crimes committed against children.108 Indeed, Mothers Against Drunk Driv ing, one of the child protection movements to emerge from this era, conceive d itself in distinctly gendered terms. As Jenkins described: \"This was a movement of women directed agai nst uncontrollable men, and the stereotypical drunk driver featured in publicity materials was invariably male.\"109 Jenkins added that the child protection move ment was also shaped by the conservative response to the advancement of a liberal soci al agenda over the pr evious decade; thus, singer-turned-conservative crus ader Anita took the name \"Save Our Children\" and framed itself as a movement to protect youth from a host of vices, from pornography to molestation.110 Jenkins' identification of the childho od protection movement's conservative underpinnings is instructive in understanding vaccine resistance. The organized vaccine safety movement that emerged contemporaneously rightly fits within this larger children protection movement, but once again, its targ et was not a social transgression, it was a political one. In describing the \"contempor ary anti-vaccination movement,\" in 2002, Johnston concluded that \"vaccine-activism clearly transcends the left-right divide\" at the turn of the twenty-first cent ury. This political transcenden ce can be traced back to the glimmer of anti-vaccine sentiment that appear ed in the seventies, when readers of both Ann Landers (a presumably politically di verse group) and the holistic-living tract 108 Brownmiller, In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution . 109 Jenkins, Decade of Nightmares: The End of the Sixties and the Making of Eighties America , 204. 110 Ibid., 120-123. 207 Mothering voiced skepticism regarding vaccines. But resistance coalesced only in the late 1970s, when, as Jenkins argues, a shift towa rd political conservativism was already underway, and the movement fully crystallized only in the 1980s, in the context of a staunchly conservative political climate. Thus , even as vaccine cri tics pressured Congress for a law establishing greater federal oversig ht of vaccine safety and a new federal compensation system for vaccine-injured children, they worked against the \"Great Society\" type laws that had made vaccines mandato ry for their children in the first place. When he won the 1980 presidential elect ion, Ronald Reagan rode a wave of popular support for his promises to slash bi g government, beef up defense, and restore America to a position of power on the international stage. 111 Viewed within this context, the emergence of an organized vaccine resi stance movement one year into Reagan's presidency can thus be seen as a movement against big government, writ small. The Carter-era expansion of vaccine laws, whic h became both universally enforceable and covered every federally recommended vacci ne by 1980, were clearly seen by vaccine resisters as an undue encroachment of government upon personal freedoms. As a response to these laws, the story of vaccine re sistance in the early 1980s thus parallels the story of Progressive Era resistance to smallpox vaccination, which historian Michael Willrich has argued encapsulated a demand for the restoration of personal liberties in response to the expansion of both \"the police pow er of the state and the cultural authority of medical science.\" 112 111 David Broder, \"Carter Yields Early in Night,\" The Washington Post , November 5, 19 80, A1. See also John Ehrman, The Eighties: America in the Age of Reagan (New Haven: Yale Un iversity Press, 2005). 112 Willrich, \"\"The Least Vaccinated of Any Civilized C ountry\": Personal Liberty and Public Health in the Progressive Era.\" 208 Indeed, in its earliest incarnations, th e vaccine-safety movement fought against the power of the state to loosen the grip of school vaccine laws strengthened in the 1970s. In its early years, its members (some of th em organized into local DPT chapters, some not) used evidence implicating the pertussis vaccine as justifica tion for policy changes that restored a greater parental role in vaccine decision making at the state level. Partnering with other Wisconsin parents, Marge Grant founded the Research Committee of Citizens for Free Choice in Immunizati on. The group recommended the dismantling of all state vaccine mandates, and it effectivel y lobbied Wisconsin legislators to amend a philosophical exemption clause to that state's vaccine laws.113 In Pennsylvania, parents pressured state officials to remove pertussis co mpletely from the list of vaccines required for school.114 In Idaho, parents lobbied for and achieved the same.115 That vaccine resisters in the late 1970s and early 1980s saw the new vaccine laws as an undue expansion of government is ex emplified by the frequency with which they compared the laws to those of the Soviet Union and Eastern European nations. When Maryland began enforcing its law requiring vaccines for school entry, Barbara Syska's son was expelled for lacking vaccines, and Syska, in response, filed suit against the board of education. \"My fight is because it's co mpulsory,\" Syska, who had immigrated from Poland, told reporters in 1979. \"I'm a refugee from a communist country. There the good of the largest number of people is important, not the individual. I came here where the 113 Thompson, DPT: Vaccine Roulette . 114 Peter Kelley, \"Whooping Cough Vaccine 's Tragic Side Effects Unmasked,\" Patriot-News , October 8, 1986, C1. 115 Sonia Nazario, \"A Parental-Rights Battle Is Hea ting up over Fears of Whooping-Cough Vaccine,\" Wall Street Journal , June 20, 1990, 17. 209 individual is supposed to have a say.\"116 The comparison of the U.S. vaccine laws to the practices of oppressive regimes soon became a common refrain among v accine critics. In her Senate testimony, mother Isabelle Ge lletich, whose son suffered brain damage following DPT vaccination, equated what she saw as the cover-up of vaccination risks as \"an American Holocaust.\" \"I wonder,\" she wr ote, \"are my son and I the survivors of a modern day Auschwitz, both of us left cr ippled and maimed by apathy and deceit?\"117 It is only in \"totalitarian societ ies where powerful bureaucrats rou tinely decide what is best for the rest of the population,\" wrote Fisher and Coulter in A Shot in the Dark .118 Epidemiologist and vaccine critic Gordon Stewart repeated the accusation on the MacNeil-Lehrer Report : \"It's only behind the Iron Curtai n that I know of any medical programs which are mandatory, aside from the so mewhat indirect mandatory effect in the United States.\" 119 Conclusion Vaccine critics achieved both the loosening of state laws and the passage of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensati on Act, which Reagan reluctantly signed into law in 1986. (Reagan openly opposed the Act, but signed it because of a provision permitting pharmaceutical companies to sell abroad drugs unapproved for use in the U.S.) 116 Emily Isberg, \"No School for Non-Immunized Child,\" Montgomery County Sentinel , February 22, 1979. 117 United States Senate Committ ee on Labor and Human Resources, Immunization and Preventive Medicine . 118 Coulter and Fisher, DPT: A Shot in the Dark . 119 The MacNeil-Lehrer Report: DPT Danger , (New York: WNET/Thirteen, 1 983). Stewart's word choice was a reference to the provisions in many state laws permitting childre n to forego mandatory vaccination for medical, religious, or philosophical reasons. 210 In addition to establishing a vaccine tax that would provide funds for the families of vaccine-injured children, the 1986 Act requir ed doctors to note vaccine reactions in patient records and report the reactions to federal authoriti es. After 1986, with Fisher and Kathi Williams at the helm of the organization, DPT continued to lobby for a safer pertussis vaccine, and helped families navigate the new federal compensation system. The organization also formed a clearinghouse, the National Vaccine Information Center, or NVIC, to disseminate information on vaccine risks and inform parents of their rights. By 1993, however, demoralized and short on funds , Fisher and Williams planned to shut down the organization. A speech that Fisher was invited to give before a group of pediatric chiropractors in Boston later that year caused them to rec onsider. Fisher's enthusiastic reception by the chiropractors\u2014and the practit ioners' generous pledges of financial support\u2014re- energized the flagging organization. \"Our or iginal goal was to get a safer pertussis vaccine for American babies,\" Fi sher later told a reporter for Today's Chiropractic Lifestyle . But after her speech in Boston, she said, \"we understood our fight was part of a larger fight for freedom of choice in health care.... So most of our work now is focused on fighting for the right to freely choose whethe r to take vaccine risks.\" It was a fight, she went on, against \"those who are trying to take away all freedom of choice in health care.\" 120 In 1993, NVIC's new focus was influenced by the national health care debate, described in Chapter 2, which pitted thos e who supported federal involvement in the expansion of health care coverage agains t those who perceived in reform efforts 120 Maria M. Lameiras, \"Fighting for a Choi ce: Vaccination - One Mother's Crusade,\" Today's Chiropractic Lifestyle , August, 2006, 31-36, 32. 211 government restriction on the poten tial to choose one's own care.121 That chiropractors loaned their support to the movement s poke to the movement's resonance with \"alternative\" and natural healing advocates, a subject that is addressed in Chapter 5. Throughout these changes, one element dictating NVIC's direction remained constant. Fisher, whose son Chris suffered a convulsion and encephalitis following his fourth DPT shot, often describe d her dedication to the cause in gendered terms. \"I was an educated woman,\" she said. \"But, when it came to medicine, I was clueless about vaccines....To know that I participated in wh at happened to my son because I did not become informed and because I trusted medi cal doctors without question is a difficult thing to live with, even now.\"122 In light of her organizati on's mission, Fisher's personal narrative illustrates the layered ideologies th at influenced vaccination skepticism in the last decades of the twentieth century. The organized vaccine safety movement that was spearheaded by Dissatisfied Parents Together was, of course, entirely distinct from the women's health movement. But its origins reveal spillover from the feminist movement of the 1970s: women who spoke out against vaccines in the early 1980s felt patronized and oppressed by the medical profession, and argued that the medical profession's tight control over information related to the pr ofession precluded them from making informed health care decisions. The effect of the earlier movement was, in effect, to produce what Ellen, in A Shot in the Dark , referred to as two broad categori es of mothers: \"those mothers who 121 See Skocpol, Boomerang: Clinton's Health Security Effort and the Turn against Government in U.S. Politics . 122 Lameiras, \"Fighting for a Choice: V accination - One Mother's Crusade,\" 36. 212 blindly accept a pediatrician's every word and can be easily reassured or controlled; and those mothers who question a diagnosis, ask for more information, and cannot be easily controlled.\"123 That the social movements of the 1970s resu lted in \"two types of mothers\" was (if an oversimplification of matters) of direct relevance for the movement that began to loudly criticize vaccine policies in the 1980s . In the 1970s, medical practitioners and health officials saw mothers as primarily re sponsible for children 's vaccination status; mothers, too, often saw themselves in this light. At the same time, vaccine-related discourse reflected changing conceptions of wome n's social roles, both as mothers and as citizens. The same discourse revealed hints of lay doubt regarding the need for and safety of vaccines; the broad anti-medicalization movement, which often spoke directly to women, sped the accumulation of those doubts. By the early 1980s, when \"Vaccine Roulette\" brought specific vacc ine risks to light for a national audience, women were widely equipped with the vocabulary to que stion those risks. A collective gendered experience was just one factor that shaped popul ar responses to vaccines in this period; concern for the protection of children and pol itical preoccupations\u2014including a rejection of big government vaccine policies\u2014also loomed large. Nonetheless, as this analysis has shown, the women's health and related moveme nts of the seventies had direct bearing on the shape and content of vaccine critiques th at gained visibility and credence in the eighties, and that gave rise to a movement that would continue to influence vaccine reception into the next century. 123 Coulter and Fisher, DPT: A Shot in the Dark , 41. 213 Chapter 5 \"Something About Tamp ering with Nature...\"1 Environmental Ethics a nd Vaccine Resistance In a 1985 letter to physician and newspa per columnist Robe rt Mendelsohn, the mother of a girl named Heather described he r and her husband's struggle to decide which vaccines to give their daughter. They had vaccinated her against polio, planned to vaccinate her against tetanus, were dead set against pertussis vaccine, but weren't sure what to do about diphtheria. They summed up their vaccine worries in a single sentence: \"We have been afraid to give them to Heathe r because we are concerned that they contain dreadful toxic things, that they would not cont ribute to her health and might cause harm to her immune system.\"2 Heather's mother was one of a growing nu mber of parents who, as described in the previous chapter, increasingly began to vocalize concerns about vaccines from the late 1970s onward. These worried parents, along with the small group of medical professionals who shared their concerns, constituted a grassroots movement that struggled against what they perceived as draconian vaccine polic ies and (as Heather's mom's letter reveals) unsafe vaccines. One as pect of this movement\u2014the formation and activities of Dissatisfied Parents Together (DPT)\u2014has received measurable attention 1 Colleen Redman-Copus, \"The Hot Dialogue on Immunizations Continues,\" Mothering , Summer, 1983, 11. 2 Robert S. Mendelsohn, The Risks of Immunization and How to Avoid Them (Evanston, IL: The People's Doctor, 1988), 51. 214 from scholars.3 But the vaccine-resistance movement in the 1970s and 1980s was far more diffuse than scholarly focus on DPT suggests, and the concerns of questioning parents were more general than the advo cacy group's initial focus on the pertussis vaccine would indicate. As the previous chap ter has shown, vaccine-ske ptical rhetoric in the 1970s and 1980s was informed as much by the publicized hazards of specific vaccines as it was by contemporary social movements, including the women's, women's health, and consumer movements. This chapte r considers the influence of a separate, but overlapping, social movement, the envir onmental movement, on vaccine beliefs and reception from the 1980s through the early 2000s. As Heather's mother's letter suggests, many who questioned vaccines at the end of the century worried that the trappings of modern life were \"toxic\" and therefore disease promoting. They frequently categori zed vaccines as modern technologies with unknown\u2014but likely devastating\u2014c onsequences for human health, and they were particularly concerned about the potential relationship between vaccination and the rising prevalence of chronic and newly emergent diseases. These same critics often espoused an ecological view of health, were troubled by what they saw as the artificial nature of vaccination, and were concerned that vacci nation represented a dangerous sort of tampering with the otherwise benign\u2014but poten tially wrathful\u2014entity known as nature. The lexicon and tactics employed by vacci ne critics from the 1980s through the early 2000s reflected a set of beliefs about the natural world and a set of ethics informed by the environmental discourses of their time. Over the course of these few decades, 3 Johnston, \"Contemporary Anti-Vacci nation Movements in Historical Pe rspective,\" 263-266; Colgrove, State of Immunity: The Politics of Vaccination in Twentieth-Century America , 211-217. 215 vaccine fears consistently mirrored larger, pe rsistent concerns about the uncertain, long- term effects of modern products and technol ogies, including pesticides, cigarettes, artificial sweeteners, and me rcury, and vaccine resisters fr equently used environmental metaphors to express these worries. Trepida tion about the unknown, long-term effects of vaccines was initially quite vague, but gradua lly these generalized anxieties evolved into well-defined fears of specific hazards, such as autism, linked to specific chemical vaccine components, such as thimerosal and aluminum . At the same time, an enduring belief in the beneficence of nature\u2014as opposed to scientists, doctors, and pharmaceutical companies\u2014led some vaccine-resistant parents to let nature immunize their children at the chicken-pox parties (and variants thereof) that became increasingly popular in the first decade of the twentieth century. This chapter traces th e environmental ethics evident in lay conceptions of vaccines and vaccina tion from the late 1970s through the early 2000s to demonstrate the varied ways in which vaccine doubts were informed by predominant patterns in thinking about natu re and the environment. Vaccine beliefs throughout this period bear the unmistakabl e impression of new environmentalist thinking as well as long-held ideas about nature (a category that encompassed both the external environment as well as the body' s natural immune system and naturally occurring bacteria and viru ses) as benign but vengeful; possessing a purpose beyond the comprehension of humanity; and worthy of a re spect and reverence usually reserved for a god. This chapter draws on a variety of sources, ranging from the prominent to the obscure, and includes the voices of a dive rse group of people whose thoughts on the subject of vaccination were not always uniform beyond bearing the imprint of new 216 environmentalism. In the1970s, the brand of vaccine skepticism strongly influenced by environmental ethics comprised only a small, diffuse movement. In the 1980s, with the founding of Dissatisfied Parents To gether and the publication of A Shot in the Dark , this type of thinking became much more visible; by the 1990s and 2000s, it became even more pronounced. I have found no evidence that self-described environmental groups expressed organized concern over the potential hazards of vaccination. Rather, my argument here is that the br oader social movement to wh ich such groups belonged had a pronounced effect on the way some Americans came to think about the environment, risk, and disease, with profound implications fo r the way they came to view vaccines. The Poisoned Needle: The Anti-Vaccinationist Legacy In the long history of vaccination resi stance, vaccine anxieties in the late twentieth century were nothing new. Nine teenth and early twentieth-century anti- vaccinationists had decried smallpox vaccina tion's potential to \"poison\" the blood by transmitting either the disease itself, othe r diseases, or animal matter with unknown consequences for health. Anti-vaccinationist fears were not unfounde d; the scratching of lymph taken from previously vaccinated (or otherwise infected) individuals into lacerations in the arms of those receivi ng vaccination under fre quently unsanitary conditions did on occasion result in infections and disfigurement. 4 The practice of vaccination (whether it used human or calf ly mph) also chafed against the ideals of nineteenth and early twentieth century health reformers and adherents of nature cures, who saw health as deriving from proper hygi ene, diet, and envir onmental conditions, and 4 Durbach, Bodily Matters: The Anti-Vaccination Movement in England, 1853-1907 , 3, 126-127. 217 who saw disease as a necessary means of ridding the body of impurities acquired by eating meat, drinking alcohol, or engaging in other unscrupulous behaviors. In Victorian England, for instance, where anti-vaccination activity was particularly robust, anti- vaccinationism found followers among medical botanists, hydropathists, hygiests and other alternative medical pr actitioners and their followers. But as historian Nadja Durbach has pointed out, the anti-vaccinat ionist cause\u2014which also found supporters among trade unionists and teetotalers\u2014was but one component of a larger culture of dissent in Victorian England, in which memb ers of the working and lower middle class threw their weight behind an array of \"pr ogressive and humanitarian campaigns\" that constituted a broad-based struggle agai nst state and industrial exploitation.5 As in Victorian England, in Victorian and subsequently in the Progressive Era U.S. anti-vaccinationism also found supporters among homeopaths, botanical physicians, hydropaths, and other medical \"irregulars.\"6 And in the U.S., as in England, anti- vaccination agitation was as much a rejection of dominant medical ideology as it was a struggle over the reach of state power, with prominent anti-vaccinationists labeling compulsory immunization a form of medical oppr ession akin to the re ligious and political oppression from which they believed their government was designed to protect them.7 Organized anti-vaccinationist activity gr ounded in such liberalist leanings 5 Ibid., 41. 6 Kaufman, \"The American Anti-V accinationists and Their Arguments.\" 7 See Chapter 2 in Colgrove, State of Immunity: The Politics of Vaccination in Twentieth-Century America ; Willrich, \"\"The Least Vaccinated of Any Civilized C ountry\": Personal Liberty and Public Health in the Progressive Era.\" 218 particularly robust in the Progressive Era U.S.8 But with changes in public health priorities and in organized medicine (see Chapter 1), and with the deaths, in close succession, of Charles Higgins and Lora Little, leaders of the Anti-V accination League of America and the American Medical Libert y League, respectively, anti-vaccination activity faded consider ably in the 1930s.9 It by no means disappeared, however, as a few devoted writers, including Annie Riley Hale, continued to attack the pract ice of vaccination thr ough the 1930s and 1940s as a form of tyranny propped up by false science and capitalism.10 A more vigorous revival of Victorian and Progr essive Era anti-vaccinationist thinking came in the 1950s, however, when California chiropractor and na turopath R.G. Wilborn founded Health Research, a small press that began republishi ng nineteenth and early twentieth century works on teetotalism, fasting, natural hygiene, and other nature cures, several of which rejected vaccination as part and parcel of a overall rejection of allopathic medicine. Wilborn's enterprise also sought out or iginal works by cont emporary alternative medicine adherents, and in 1957 the press published a book titled The Poisoned Needle , by California naturopath Eleanor McBean.11 McBean's book, a harangue ag ainst both allopathic medi cine and the practice of vaccination, compiled more than a century of commentary on the moral transgressions 8 See Part IV of Johnston, The Radical Middle Class: Populist Democracy and the Question of Capitalism in Progressive Era Portland, Oregon . 9 Colgrove, State of Immunity: The Politics of Vaccination in Twentieth-Century America , 74. 10 Annie Riley Hale, The Medical Voodoo (New York: Gotham House, 1935). 11 Eleanor McBean, The Poisoned Needle: Suppressed Facts About Vaccination (Mokelumne Hill, Calif.: Health Research, 1957). 219 and physical hazards posed by vaccination. While she cited the works of a few contemporaries, including American natura l hygienist Herbert Shelton and British anti- vaccinationist Lily Loat, the bulk of her volum e revisited the arguments of Victorian and Progressive Era philosophers, scientists, he alers, and anti-vacci nationists, including British philosopher John Stuart Mill, Britis h naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, and American hydropath and health reformer Ru ssell Trall. Quoting from this array of sources, McBean argued that vaccination poiso ned the blood with animal proteins, was based on the false premise of germ theory, a nd served only to gild the coffers of profit- hungry doctors. She decried compulsory vaccin ation as an act of \"medical oppression\" and a form of \"enslavement\" practiced only by the most \"backward\" of states. She also denounced vaccination\u2014compulsory or not\u2014as a di rect affront to the laws of nature. This particular premise of McBean's ha d long been held by anti-vaccinationists and so-called medical irregular s of all stripes. Wallace, be st known for articulating the theory of natural selection, saw vaccination as \"an attempt to cheat outraged nature\" at its own necessary endeavors.12 Quoting Wallace, Trall, Sh elton, anti-vaccinationist physician John W. Hodge, and ot hers, McBean rearticulated a philosophy that saw nature and its human inhabitants, in their untouched st ates, as existing in perfect equilibrium. In humans, poor nutrition and the consumption of processed foods disrupted the body's natural equipoise; it was these ha bits, not germs, that resulted in disease. Disease, wrote McBean, was the body's way of cleansing it self of \"excess poisons, waste matter, obstructions, and incompatible food.\" \"DISEASE IS NOT SOMETHING TO BE 12 Alfred Russel Wallace, The Wonderful Century: Its Successes and Its Failures (New York: Dodd, Mead, 1898), 314. 220 CURED; IT IS A CURE,\" she emphatically wrote.13 McBean quoted extensively from nineteenth century French bi ologist Antoine Bechamp, who had proposed that germs did not cause disease but were rather the result of disease, drawn to diseased tissue to consume it and return it to nature. Combining Bechamp's premise with Russel's theory of evolution, McBean argued, as other post-germ theory anti-vaccinationists had before her, that germs were \"useful wherev er they are f ound in nature.\"14 By fighting germs and not the true causes of disease, McBean wrot e, \"modern medical methods\"\u2014including first and foremost frus trate the unexcelled healing efforts of nature.\"15 Modern medical methods (understood as inherently \"unnatural\") were not the only threat to health; McBean documented a litany of modern commodities and habits that destroyed the wellbeing of both humans and their envi ronment. Like the century's worth of natural healers who came before her, she emphasized the centr ality of a diet of whole, unprocessed foods to good health. Bu t McBean's list of modern \"poisons\" included not only canned, refined, and otherwis e processed foods but also food additives and preservatives, Coca Cola, tobacco, and chem ical fertilizers and insecticide sprays. Writing just before Rachel Carson would begin work on Silent Spring , McBean denounced the use of DDT and blamed it and other sprays for a host of modern ills, including cancer, heart disease, and polio. In her view, mass vaccination was a calculated distraction from the true causes (\"foodless foods\" and \"poison sprays\") of allegedly 13 Eleanor McBean, The Poisoned Needle , 3rd ed. (Mokelumne Hill, CA : Health Research, 1974), 27. 14 Ibid. 15 Ibid. 221 vaccine-preventable diseases (such as polio ). Like Carson would, McBean (referencing the recent emergence of a literature on organi c agriculture) drew an ecological view of health, in which insecticides caused harm not only to birds, butterflies, and bees, but also to humans. Insecticide sprays poisoned food di rectly, she wrote, and were being washed from crops into soil, where they killed earth worms and other organisms vital for healthy soil, which was vital for producing health crops to fortify humans; the sprays caused even further damage by contaminating water supp lies that both humans and animals relied upon. To McBean, widespread pesticide applic ations, which citizens were powerless to avoid, were, like vaccination, crimes committed by government acting in the interest of powerful corporations with no regard for human health. She wrote, \"This staggering increase in a preventable disease is a grave reflection upon our present system of living with its popularized blood pollution practices by way of vaccination campaigns and mass poisoning as a result of government enforced spraying of fruits and vegetables with deadly lead arsenate and other poisons. The power politics of the drug and chemi cal companies have also influenced legislation to set aside vast sums of th e taxpayer's money with which to buy their poison chemicals.... The people are told th at these practices are beneficial but facts disclaim these statements.\"16 Like Carson, McBean tallied rising cancer rates and highlighted the correlation between increasing cancer prevalence and increas ing deployment of both vaccines and insecticides. She also drew a parallel betw een these two categories of modern hazards and a third: atomic radiation. In McBean's view atomic radiation was the only modern poison that caused more harm to human health than vaccination did. McBean's book likely had only a limited audience in the late 1950s; just 500 copies of the book's first edition were pub lished in 1957. But seventeen years later, 16 Ibid., 44. Emphasis in original 222 Health Research reissued The Poisoned Needle , this time printing 5,000 copies.17 By then, polio and smallpox had all but disappear ed from the U.S.; nonetheless, vaccination efforts were on an upswing. The 1962 Vaccination Assistance Act had allocated funds to help states expand their imm unization programs. In the years that followed, three new vaccines, against measles, mumps, and r ubella, had been licensed for use and recommended for children; in response, stat es began updating and expanding the scope of their immunization laws. The Centers for Di sease Control in 1966 announced a measles eradication campaign, and health official s began debating the broader utility of compulsory immunization laws for all vaccine-preventable diseases and not just smallpox, the disease for which the bulk of existing laws had initially been written. 18 (See Chapters 1 and 3 for a more complete discus sion of the expansion of federal vaccination efforts in the 1960s and 1970s.) These changes in the immunization la ndscape took place against a backdrop of great social change in the U. S. In the 1960s a series of new social movements began to emerge, embracing the principles of particip atory democracy to demand the granting and protection of an array of rights and freedom s. McBean's anti-professional stance, her assertion of the value of American freedoms, and her claims that ju stice (in matters of medical oppression and exploitation specifica lly) had too long been the exclusive province of the wealthy undoubtedly had part icular resonance for readers moved by the 17 Ibid. See message from the publisher, inside front cover. 18 Charles Jackson, \"State Laws on Compul sory Immunization in the United States,\" Public Health Reports 84, no. 9 (1969): 787-794. 223 rhetoric of the New Left. The same was lik ely true for the litany of environmental concerns she detailed as well. By 1974, the year The Poisoned Needle was reissued, Silent Spring had helped foster a new environmental movement, whic h had popularized concer ns about radiation, heavy metals, and pesticides; led to the passage of federal laws to protect the quality of air, water, and other natural resources; and demonized DDT in particular in a series of widely publicized hearings.19 The values that McBean wove together in The Poisoned Needle \u2014the preciousness of freedom and nature combined with a mistrust of government and industrialists\u2014anticipated popular attitudes of many seventies social activists by the better part of a generation. Indeed, as the 1970s progressed, McBean, then in her seventies, found a new audience for her though ts. She published three more anti-vaccine books between 1977 and 1980, and her followers began writing their own books and penned pieces inspired by her work fo r a range of \"altern ative\" publications.20 McBean's books may never have garnered a tremendous readership, but renewed interest in The Poisoned Needle in the 1970s was significant in th at the book carried over a set of anti- vaccinationist ideas from the first half of the century (and earlier) to the latter half. The book thus served as a bridge between the anti -vaccinationism that faded in the 1930s and the renewed vaccine skepticism that began to gain momentum in the 1970s. The attention 19 Samuel Hays and Barbara Hays, Beauty, Health, and Permanence: Environmental Politics in the United States, 1955-1985 (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1987), 175; Thomas R.

New Vaccine Fears The brand of vaccine skepticism that incr eased in prevalence at the end of the century inherited several key ideas from McB ean, and, in turn, from the natural healers and anti-vaccinationists whose work (am ong others') inspired her own. This long inheritance is evidenced in the vaccine doubts expressed by many parents, doctors, and others from the 1970s through the 1990s. Seve ral of their predominant concerns were grounded in the ideas that nature was benevol ent; that health derived from balance and harmony with the natural order; and that vacc ines were akin to environmental hazards inasmuch as they were products of industry with uncertain and pot entially harmful long- term consequences. The vaccine beliefs held by many critics in this period mapped neatly onto the \"natural values\" that defined postwar Amer ican environmentalism in historian Samuel Hays' analysis.21 According to Hays, the environmentalism that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s was characterized by (among other factors) the rise of popular ecology; concern with the health consequences of environmental choices; and a sense of a ubiquitously toxic environment. Over the course of the 1970s, a series of episodes\u2014 including the detection of cancer-causing chem icals in New Orleans' water supply, the discovery of toxic waste at Love Canal, and the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island\u2014 21 Hays and Hays, Beauty, Health, and Permanence: Environmental Politics in the United States, 1955- 1985 , 22-24. 225 helped create what Hays called \"a widely shared perception of harm\" along with the widespread sense that government and industr y had taken insufficient measures to protect the populace from harmful toxic exposures. The consequences of such exposures, as historians Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner have shown, were often slow in coming to light, hampered both by industry obfuscation and by the scientif ic challenges of proving a cau se-and-effect relationship between a single chemical exposure (such as tobacco smoke) and a health outcome that arose much later in life (such as lung or colon cancer). By the 1970s, Markowitz and Rosner illustrate, consumers had been given legitimate cause to question the safety of products as diverse as asbestos blankets and red food dye No. 2.22 The element of uncertainty\u2014a dominant theme in the history of environmental health\u2014linked the stories of such products.23 As Markowitz and Rosner put it, \"Lead, asbestos, tobacco, and radioactive materials became widely used because scientific studies could not prove with certainty that these substances caused harm.\"24 That such widely used products were ultimately demonstrated to be harmful, despite the assurances of industry, government officials, and health professionals, left an a rray of consumer products open to the critique that they too might someday be proven hazardous. This focus on the uncertain and unknowable long-term consequences of c onsumer-product interactions marks the beginning, in the 1970s, of what historians Jo seph Melling and Christopher Sellers have 22 Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner, Deceit and Denial: The Deadly Politics of Industrial Pollution , California/Milbank Books on Health and the Public (New York: The Milbank Memorial Fund, 2002), 4. 23 Greg Mitman, Michelle Murphy, and Christopher Sellers, \"Introduction: A Cloud over History,\" Osiris 19 (2004): 1-20. 24 Markowitz and Rosner, Deceit and Denial: The Deadly Politics of Industrial Pollution , 6. Emphasis in original. 226 termed a new \"industrial hazard regime.\" In this regime, lay environmental anxieties focused less on workplace or ambient envi ronmental exposures (as they had during earlier periods), and increasingly on the pot ential hazards of widespread everyday consumer product exposures.25 The new environmentalism thus provide d a framework for critics to question vaccines by highlighting the scie ntific uncertainties inherent in their use. Writing in 1978, Maine physician and vaccine critic Daniel La nder argued that \"in reality, no one knows for sure how effective or safe immunization rea lly is and it is unlikely that we will ever know....\"26 Across the country in Oregon, childbirt h educator Cynthia Cournoyer echoed this notion in a pamphlet she began self -publishing in 1983: When you vaccinate your child, she wrote, \"you cannot be sure you are not also administer ing a serious side effect. Some disadvantages have already been pr oven and much is left unknown. There is no conclusive evidence vaccines are completely safe.\"27 Richard Moskowitz, a Harvard and New York University-trained physician turned homeopath and vaccine critic, pointed out that not only were there uncertainties inherent in vaccine use, but that no effort had been made to uncover the long-term implications of their use. \"The fact is that we do not know 25 Joseph Melling and Christopher Sellers, \"Introduction,\" in Dangerous Trade: Histories of Industrial Hazard across a Globalizing World , ed. Joseph Melling and Christopher Sellers (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2011). 26 Lander, \"On Immunization.\"; Daniel A. Lander, \"Immunization: An Informed Choice,\" (Glen Cove, ME: Dr. Daniel Lander, Family Chiropractor, 1978). 27 Cynthia Cournoyer, \"What About Immunizations?,\" (Canby, Oregon: Concerned Parents for Information, 1983). 227 and have never even attempted to discover what actually becomes of these foreign substances once they are inside the human body,\" he wrote in 1984.28 In addition to providing critics with a new means of legitimizing vaccine anxieties, environmentalism also provide d a new lexicon with which to disparage vaccines. For many vaccine skeptics, the im age of a dangerously polluted environment served as a powerful metaphor for the c ontemporary condition of the human body. Such critiques viewed the human body as microcosm, facing the same onslaught of toxins that had threatened the wellbeing of the natura l macrocosm. Historian Peter Coates has pointed out that while nature has for centu ries been perceived as indomitable, new environmentalists simultaneously lamented its fragility and the loss of its purity.29 In the post-environmental era, vaccine critics saw the human body through the same lens. McBean and her followers embraced this line of thinking\u2014that no environment, ambient or bodily, could be purified via the addition of ever more pollutants: \"Certainly a city or other area cannot be immunized from po llution by introducing more contaminating substances into it.... Could a thinking public be so brainwashed as to believe that the addition of more smog to their city would possibly have the effect of purifying it?\" 30 Other commentators evoked the polluted environment to raise the specter of uncertain consequences of vaccination. Wrote herbalist Jaime Murphy in his 1994 book on vaccines, \"It is no mystery that we cannot dump raw sewage into our harbors without it 28 Richard Moskowitz, \"Immunizations: The Other Side,\" Mothering , 1984, 32-37. 29 Peter A. Coates, Nature: Western Attitudes since Ancient Times (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998). 30 Crawford, \"The Poisoned Needle,\" 40. 228 having a deleterious effect on the ecosystem. It is also clear th at we cannot bury oil drums or carelessly discard industrial solvents without seriously polluting the land, waters, or aquifers. Similarly, we cannot pollu te our cells and bloodstream with vaccines and other toxic drugs and thi nk that these will not produce damaging side effects over time.\"31 Earlier anti-vaccinationists commonl y referred to vaccination as blood \"pollution,\" but in the 1970s and afterward, this metaphor en compassed a distinct set of meanings. It evoked the irreversible biological and chemical pollution of bodies and the environment; it also evoked the hubris and shortsightedness of sc ience and industry, a portrayal that was a hallmark of the new environmentalism. Influential new environmentalists such as Barry Commoner popularized in the 1960s and 1970s the idea that society had establishe d a pattern of committing to new technologies\u2014nuclear weapons, fertilizers, insecticides, deterg ents, and automobiles among them\u2014before the consequences of mass deployment were completely understood.32 In the aftermath of several widely publicized drug scares (tha lidomide, DES), and following the revelation that the 1976 swine flu inoculation camp aign had done more harm than good, lessons initially relevant to the environmental arena began to colo r perception of mass vaccination as well. Wrote a Boston Globe reporter in response to the swine flu fiasco: \"it was as if Mother Nature were warning us ag ainst arrogance: there are many things in a world full of biological hazards that we don' t understand, don't even have the tools to 31 Jamie Murphy, What Every Parent Should Know About Childhood Immunization (Boston: Earth Healing Products, 1994), 20. 32 Barry Commoner, Science and Survival (New York: Viking Press, 1966). 229 understand.\"33 Moskowitz, among others, applied the lessons of environmental disasters to vaccination more broadly. As he put it in 1984: \"we have been taught to accept vaccination as a sacrament of our...participation in the unrestr icted growth of scientific and industrial technology, utterly heedless of the long-term consequences to the health of our own species, let alone to the balance of nature as a whole.\"34 In envisioning the potential for undesi rable long-term consequences, many vaccine skeptics invoked the e nvironmentalist metaphor of th e chemical time bomb. In How to Raise a Healthy Child in Spite of Your Doctor , Dr. Robert Mendelsohn (see Chapter 4) suggested that vaccines might be a \"medical time bomb\" simply because \"no one knows the long-term consequences of inje cting foreign proteins into the body of your child.\"35 To La Leche League founder Marian Tomp son, the consequences were clear: in her view, vaccination was creati ng a generation of weak, defens eless beings. \"Instead of taking personal responsibility for our body' s immunological system, we try to handle everything with a vaccine, insulting our bodi es and creating a sicker, more endangered species. We are, literally, walk ing time bombs!\" she wrote in 1982.36 Tompson believed, as many other vaccine critics did, that th e artificial nature of vaccination was compromising children's natural defenses. Bu t neither Mendelsohn nor Tompson pointed specifically to the explosive potential of any particular component of vaccines; to both, 33 Richard Knox, \"A Shot in Arm, a Shot in Dark,\" Boston Globe , December 26, 1976, A2. 34 Moskowitz, \"Immunizations: The Other Side.\" 35 Robert S. Mendelsohn, How to Raise a Healthy Child...In Spite of Your Doctor (Chicago: Contemporary Books, 1984), 232. 36 Reprinted in Marian Tompson, \"Viewpoint (1982),\" in The Risks of Immunization and How to Avoid Them , ed. Robert S. Mendelsohn (Evanston, IL: The People's Doctor, 1988), 31. 230 the vaccines in their entirety were the explosive material s encapsulated in human bodies. Sporadically in the 1980s and increasingly in the 1990s, however, critics began to focus expressly on the chemical components of vaccines; soon these became the ticking time bomb. As Murphy proposed in 1994, \"the co mbination of mercury, aluminum, and formaldehyde [in vaccines]...might have crea ted a kind of time bomb whose ultimate outcome was being played out in the cel ls, tissues, and blood of the human body, and whose effect no scientist w ould venture to predict.\"37 Within a few years, as described later in this chapter, concerns about these specific components of vaccines would in fact come to fully supplant more genera lized worries about vaccination. In the meantime, La Leche League's Tompson's worry\u2014t hat vaccination was weakening the species\u2014was related to a broade r set of perceptions regarding the artificial nature of vaccines, the superi ority of natural immunity, and the importance of balance to the pursuit of health. While many people began to merely question vaccines in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a subset re jected vaccines outright; many of the latter paired this rejection with a dismissal of germ theory. Li ke McBean and many of her forebears, some late-twentieth century anti-vaccinationists argued that germs did not cause disease, frequently referencing Bechamp, as McBean had. Vaccines were unnecessary according to this view, which portrayed sickness as re sulting not from microor ganisms but from an imbalance between \"a person's inner environmen t and the external world,\" in the words of Mothering contributor Leonard Jacobs. Jacobs added, \"Vaccinations for creating an artificial immunity against sickness then become unnecessary; we can avoid the problem entirely by establishing and ma intaining a healthy balance between the child and his or 37 Murphy, What Every Parent Should Know About Childhood Immunization , 39. 231 her environment.\"38 Jacobs and like-minded vaccine skeptics argued that immunity was \"the natural ability to maintain balance w ith the environment,\" and could be obtained through breastfeeding, a balanced diet, and exercise.39 (Others added such elements as \"relaxation\" and a \"positi ve attitude\" to the list.40) This ecological view of health, which persisted in vaccine-skeptical discourse th rough the 1990s, was not the exclusive purview of germ-theory nihilists, however. Some, like Mothering reader and New York pediatrician Victor LaCerva, shared the belief that health derived from internal balance and balance with one's environment while a sserting that viruses and bacteria caused disease in bodies \"out of balance.\"41 What, then, did \"balance\" signify for peopl e with vaccine doubts or, like LaCerva, vaccine circumspection? For many, including LaCe rva, it signified an approach to health that emphasized lifestyle choi ces, including the decisions to breastfeed, exercise, avoid processed foods, and get adequate rest, an appr oach that gained increased traction in the 1970s.42 It also signified the acknowledgement th at humans were part of an ecosystem, their own wellbeing dependent on the wellbeing of the larger environment in which they lived. It was this perception that prompted California physician Paul Fleiss to write (also in a letter to Mothering ), that vaccination was just one wa y of preventing disease, albeit a less important way than the pursuit of clean ai r and water and the avoidance of radiation 38 Leonard Jacobs, \"Eating Well--the Best Vaccine,\" Mothering , Fall, 1978, 17. \"A Mother's Research on Immunization,\" Mothering , Fall, LaCerva, \"Letter to the Editor,\" Mothering , Spring, 1979, 6. 42 See Part III of James C. Whorton, Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002). 232 and nuclear bombs.43 Balance also referred to a quasi -religious belief in the precise, perfectly calibrated interplay of natural syst ems, from the molecular to the macro, that was designed to promote health but was so intricate and complex that it was beyond the comprehension of humans. \"There is a wis dom within the body,\" wrote Maine physician and vaccine skeptic Lander, illustrating this point of view. \"The human body has the most complex organic machinery in the world. It pr oduces all the chemicals one will ever need to be healthy...The wisdom that created our bodie s is far superior to the finite mind of all scientists in the world.\"44 Lander and other vaccine critics deliberatel y distinguished between what they saw as \"artificial\" immunization\u2014that is, vaccina tion\u2014and natural immunity, which derived not from a pharmaceutical product but from lifestyle choices. As Jacobs put it, \"Immunity is completely natural and not a rare privilege to be bought with money or acquired from the technological arsenal.\" 45 Indeed, it was the artificial nature of vaccines that most often came under attack by critics from the 1970s onward, much as it had in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. (McBean herself fre quently decried the \"artificial\" nature of vaccines.) Vaccines were considered artificial not for their ingredients\u2014at least, not initially\u2014but becau se they represented a contrived way of encountering disease. As Oregon childbirth e ducator Cournoyer argu ed, injecting viruses and bacteria directly into the bloodstream was a \"unnatural way of handling foreign 43 Paul Fleiss, \"Letter to the Editor,\" Mothering , Winter, 1997, 45 Jacobs, \"Eating Well--the Best Vaccine.\" 233 material, contrary to all other forms of ingestion.\"46 To many skeptics, proof of the inferiority of artificial vacci nation lay in the ever-growi ng number of booster shots recommended for their children, and in the app earance of vaccine-preventable diseases in vaccinated children. \"Did you know,\" wrote La Leche League's Tompson, \"that when immunity to a disease is acquired naturall y, the possibility of reinfection is only 3.2 percent? If the immunity comes from a v accination, the chance of reinfection is 80 percent.\" 47 Vaccine skeptic Diane Rozario, who de scribed herself as a \"strong supporter of breastfeeding and proper nutrition and a de vout Roman Catholic,\" argued that for this reason, vaccines shouldn't be called immuni zations. \"Anti-vaccinationists don't like the word immunization,\" she wrote, \"because they don't think va ccines confer true immunity.\"48 That vaccines were perceived as artific ial\u2014and that their artificial nature was something to be abhorred\u2014was implied by the adoption of the term \"toxic\" to describe them. McBean (in the tradition of earlier anti -vaccinationists) had routinely referred to vaccines as \"poisons\"; writing in the 1970s, McBean continued to employ this metaphor, equating immunization to being bitten by a poisonous snake. In the 1970s and 1980s, however, the word had less traction than it onc e did, and vaccine critics broadly turned instead to the terms \"toxin\" and \"toxic,\" bot h of which were becoming popularly adopted with the diffusion of contemporary envir onmentalist thinking. As Hays points out, 46 Cynthia Cournoyer, What About Immunizations? Exposing the Vaccine Philosophy , 5th ed. (Santa Cruz: Nelson's Books, 1991), 27. 47 Tompson, \"Viewpoint (1982).\" 48 Diane Rozario, The Immunization Resource Guide , 2nd ed. (Burlington, Iowa: Patter Publications, 1994). 234 concerns about the toxic envi ronment were ubiquitous in th e early phases of the new environmentalism, but these morphed quickly into concerns about how substances wreaked toxic effects on human bodies.49 Pesticides, artificial sweeteners, food dyes, drugs, and other consumer products were al l subject to popular attack and government regulation for their potential or demonstrated toxic effects on humans, and vaccines, to some, seemed a logical inclusion. \"All vaccin es, like drugs, are toxic. None render the body healthy, but rather more toxic,\" wrot e natural hygienist Grace Girdwain in 1979.50 One referred to vaccines as \"s tandardly accepted injectable toxins.\"51 In a new edition of her self-published pamphlet, Oregon childbirth educator Cournoyer told readers that \"Manufacturers of vaccines admit they are highly toxic and by their very nature, cannot be made safe.\" Cournoyer went on to list the \"toxic ingredients\" in vaccines. In addition to \"horse blood, dog kidney tissue...and other decomposing proteins,\" she listed: \"Phenol - (Carbolic acid) a deadly poison Formaldehyde - A known cancer causing agent which is commonly used to embalm corpses. Mercury - A toxic heavy metal that is not easily eliminated from the body Alum - A preservative Aluminum phosphate - Used in deodorants. Toxic. Acetone - A solvent used in fingerna il polish remover. Very volatile. Glycerin - A tri-atomic alcohol extracted from natural fats which are putrified and decomposed. Some toxic effects of gly cerine are kidney, liver, lung damage, diuresis, pronounced local tissue damage, gastrointestinal damage and death. 49 Hays and Hays, Beauty, Health, and Permanence: Environmental Politics in the United States, 1955- 1985 , 171-177. 50 Grace Girdwain, \"Immunizations for Public and Mothering , Spring, 1979, 10. 51 Roxanne Bank, in Vaccinations O'Mara (Santa Fe: Mothering 1988), 235 Aluminum and Oil Adjuvants - Carcinoge nic (cancer-producing) in laboratory mice.\"52 This focus on the chemical components of vaccines marked a distinct departure from earlier vaccine criticism, which had fo cused exclusively on the potential hazards of the biological components of vaccines, including \"horse blood\" and \"cow pus.\"53 Cournoyer, writing in 1987, was not the first to enumerate the synthetic chemicals used in vaccines; public health worker Carol Horowitz had included a similar list in an article for Mothering four years earlier. \"Most parents who are trying to f eed their children properly would not let them eat a food which cont ained any of the many ingredients in immunizations,\" Horowitz wrote.54 Both Horowitz and Cournoyer employed the modifier \"toxic\" to refer to the nature of the chemical s they listed; by pointing out that some were carcinogenic, they implicated vaccines in the ever-growing epidemic of cancer. By pointing out that vaccines includ ed heavy metals, they hinted that immunization might be implicated in other epidemics as well. To Cournoyer, the presence of such compounds in vaccines was proof that the products were under-regulated and thus unsafe. \"When cancer causing elements are found in foods , they are either banned (remember cyclamates?) or an obvious warning label app ears on the package (saccharin, cigarettes),\" 52 Cynthia Cournoyer, What About Immunizations? , 4th ed. (Grants Pass, Oregon: Cynthia Cournoyer, 1987), 3. 53 Cournoyer still worried about such substances, but placed heavier emphasis on chemical ingredients in vaccines. To contrast her views with the wo rries of earlier vaccine skeptics, see McBean, The Poisoned Needle: Suppressed Facts About Vaccination . See also Durbach, Bodily Matters: The Anti-Vaccination Movement in England, 1853-1907 . 54 Horowitz, \"Immunizations and Informed Consent,\" 37. 236 she wrote, building to her conclusion: \"T here seems to be a double standard for vaccines!\"55 Chronic Disease Fears In the eyes of vaccine critics, both asp ects of the artificial nature of vaccines\u2014 their unique interface with the immune system and their contents\u2014implicated vaccines in an ever-shifting list of seem ingly modern epidemics. The suspicion that vaccines might be responsible for the emergence or increasi ng prevalence of new (or perceived-as-new) diseases was long held by anti -vaccinationists. In her 1935 book The Medical Voodoo , Annie Riley Hale argued in favor of the theo ry that vaccination wa s contributing to the steady rise in cancer.56 In 1957 and 1974 (her book was reissued a third time, in 1993) McBean argued that the \"900 percent increase\" in cancer deaths in the first half of the century was brought on by \"universal blood poisoning\" caused by vaccination.57 McBean, quoting Hale, maintained that mode rn medicine's greatest accomplishment had thus been to \"swap smallpox for cancer and t yphoid fever for diabetes and insanity.\" The suspicion that vaccinat ion had resulted in an unfavorable trade-off was oft-repeated by vaccine critics at the end of the twentiet h century. Popular physician-author Robert Mendelsohn proposed that Americans had \"t raded mumps and measles for cancer and leukemia.\"58 Cournoyer agreed, stating that through vaccination, Americans had 55 Cournoyer, What About Immunizations? , 3. 56 Hale, The Medical Voodoo . 57 McBean, The Poisoned Needle , 21. 58 Mendelsohn, How to Raise a Healthy Child...In Spite of Your Doctor , 211. 237 \"essentially traded off acute, epidemic diseases of the past century for the weaker far less curable epidemic of chronic diseases of the present.\"59 For much of the twentieth century, anti-v accinationists and vaccine skeptics were unanimous in their suspicion of a link between vaccination and cancer. But around 1980, fears that vaccines were res ponsible for climbing cancer rate s gave way to fears that vaccines were responsible for other epidem ics, namely, epidemics of autoimmune diseases, learning disabilities, and childhood be havioral disorders. These anxieties were linked to the belief that vaccination constitu ted an unnatural bodily intrusion, and they shifted in response to other cultural a nxieties. In the wake of the 1975 Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA, which followe d an explosion of findings on genetic disorders and great advances in (and trep idations about) the science of genetic manipulation, some scientists speculated th at vaccines might be introducing disease- inducing genetic material into the body.60 Vaccine skeptics quickly picked up on and circulated such hypotheses. In a 1976 issue of his newsletter, The People's Doctor , Mendelsohn described a theory proposed by a Rutgers University geneticist, that \"immunization programs against flu, measles, mu mps, polio, etc. actually may be seeding humans with RNA to form pro-viruses which will then become latent cells throughout the body. Some of these latent provi ruses could be molecules in search of diseases which under proper conditions become activated and cause a variety of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, l upus erythematosus, Parkinson's disease and 59 Cournoyer, What About Immunizations? Exposing the Vaccine Philosophy , 30. 60 On advances in genetic research in this period, see Chapters 17 and 18 in Daniel J. Kevles, In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity , 1st ed. (New York: Knopf, 1985). 238 perhaps cancer.\"61 Eight years later (follo wing, not coincidentally, the discovery of HIV), Mendlesohn wrote of the \"growing suspicio n\" among scientists that \"immunization against relatively harmless childhood diseases may be re sponsible for the dramatic increase in autoimmune diseases si nce mass inoculations were introduced.\"62 With the advent of AIDS, preoccupati ons with the potential link between vaccination and epidemic cancer were largely su pplanted by concerns that vaccines were responsible for epidemic levels of immune dysfunction. Some feared that AIDS itself might have been caused by mass inoculation, linking the emergence of AIDS to the deployment of specific, purporte dly tainted vaccines, such as those against polio and hepatitis B (see Chapter 6). Others linke d AIDS, and the \"overall immunologic weakening of our children,\" to the artificial nature of vaccination generally, and not to the contents of any one specific type of vaccine.63 Pennsylvania physician Harold Buttram and microbiologist John C. Hoffman, writing in 1985, contended that vaccines operated \"contrary to the principles of natural imm unity,\" because, as injections, they bypassed mucous membranes and instead directly stimul ated a set of antibodies that were not the body's usual first line of defense. As injections of \"massive antigenic material,\" vaccines thus constituted, in their view, a form of \"immunol ogic shock treatment\" that continuously depleted the immune system's re sources. They proposed that this artificial route to immunity (coupled with exposure to environmenta l pollution and consumption of 61 Mendelsohn, The Risks of Immunization and How to Avoid Them , 2. 62 Mendelsohn, How to Raise a Healthy Child...In Spite of Your Doctor , 211. 63 Harold E. Buttram and John Chriss Hoffma n, \"Bringing Vaccines into Perspective,\" Mothering , Winter, 1985, 42. 239 formula and processed foods) was responsible for causing an \"AIDS-like state\" in babies and young children that was manife sting as an overwhelming ri se in allergic disorders.64 One didn't need expertise in medicine or immunology to draw a line between vaccines, their purportedly artific ial nature, and intract able, high-profile epidemics. \"The thought of injecting toxins (of fairly dubious origin s) into my children, who have never known any illness more serious that an occasional cold, is absurd....In this era of malfunctions of the immune system\u2014cancer and AIDS speci fically\u2014our country w ould be better off spending its research money on learning about immune functions ,\" one parent wrote in a letter to The People's Doctor in 1988.65 Buttram continued to speak out against v accines and maintain ed into the 2000s that vaccination appeared to play a role in rising rates of auto immune diseases and allergies. In 1992, however, he ar gued that among recent trends in the health of American children and young adults, the \"most ominous of all is the rise in childhood behavioral disorders, including hyperactiv ity and learning disorders.\"66 These very same conditions presented themselves to Barbara Loe Fisher and Harris Coulter as potential vaccine hazards when they wrote their 1985 expos\u00e9 on the risks of pertussis vaccination, DPT: A Shot in the Dark (described in Chapter 4). 67 After perusing the medical literature to 64 Ibid. Buttram was not a traditional allopathic practiti oner; he espoused alternative medical views and had personal ties to the anti-immunization groups of the early part of the century, including the Anti- Vaccination Society of America. Biographica l details on Buttram appear in Allen, Vaccine: The Controversial Story Lifesaver , 338-342. 65 J.M., \"Reader Letter,\" in The Risks of Immunization and How to Avoid Them , ed. Robert S. Mendelsohn (Evanston, IL: The People's Doctor, 1988), 90. 66 Harold E. Buttram, \"Foreward,\" in Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective? , ed. Neil Z. Miller (Santa Fe: New Atlantean Press, 1992), 9-11. 67 Coulter and Fisher, DPT: A Shot in the Dark . 240 compile the evidence linking pertussis vaccinat ion and episodes of convulsions, seizures, encephalitis, and permanent brain damage in children, they addressed the possibility that the pertussis vaccine might also be respons ible for a far greater number of cases of \"minimal brain dysfunction, or learning disabi lities,\" including hyperactivity, dyslexia, and autism. Coulter and Fisher proposed th at the connection between vaccination and minimal brain dysfunction might have been mi ssed by scientists because of the lag time between exposure and effect. They found inspiration in Rachel Carson's Silent Spring , quoting her at the start of a chapter th ey titled \"Long Term Damage\": \"We are accustomed to look for the gross and immediate effect and to ignore all else. Unless this appears promptly, we deny the existence of hazard. Even research men suffer from the handicap of inadequate methods of detecting the beginnings of injury.\" 68 Throughout their book, Coulter and Fisher presented th e collected reports of parents who had documented allergies, deafness, and hyperactivity or other learning disa bilities in children who had suffered reactions to the vaccine as infants; for the authors, Carson's words suggested that no matter the time lag between the shot and these symptoms, a connection between the two was possible. They proceeded to point out that since the pertussis vaccine had come into use, the number of lear ning disabled children had been growing at \"a phenomenal rate\" and hyperactivity prevalence had increased to affect one in every twenty children. \"Is it a coincidence that this dramatic rise in America's learning-disabled population occurred precisely during the thr ee decades when the pertussis vaccine was being extended to include virtually all American children?\" they asked.69 \"Has the toxic 68 Ibid., 110. 69 Ibid., 115. 241 neurological effect of the pertussis vaccine left its stamp on the mental and physical makeup of two whole generations in the modern world?\"70 Coulter and Fisher laid all their grievan ces at the foot of the pertussis vaccine, unlike the parents who had, by then, been quest ioning the safety of vaccines generally for a decade in such periodicals as Mothering , The People's Doctor , and East/West Journal . Like other vaccine critics, Coulter and Fisher decried the pertussis vaccine's toxicity, but although they used a term that had come, in the wake of the environmental movement, to popularly connote the damaging effects of ch emical exposures, they used the term \"toxic\" in reference to the biological toxins in pertussis vacc ine. They described the efforts on the parts of scientists to isolate the neurotoxic component in pertussis bacteria and held out hope that a safe r vaccine was possible. A less toxic, acellular (as opposed to whole-cell) pertussis vaccine was already in use in Japan, and the authors demanded that the same vaccine be made available in the U.S. Thus, although their doubts were informed by questions about long-term sa fety that environmentalism had made mainstream, they did not reject all vaccines outright, nor di d they display the complete lack of faith in the promise of orthodox me dical technologies that many other critics did display. Coulter and Fisher's volume was one of several media that gave a mainstream voice to vaccine skepticism in the first ha lf of the 1980s. (Mendelsohn's books and his appearance on the talk show \"D onahue,\" in addition to severa l national news features on the dangers of pertussis vaccine, also brought vaccine criticism out of alternative health and natural lifestyle magazines and into the national spotlight.) Th eir book was distinct 70 Ibid., 52. 242 from the \"vaccine guides\" that would begin to increase in popularity just a few years later, many of which questioned the safety and value of vaccination generally and often displayed a penchant for natural and altern ative health methods, which, as historian James Whorton has pointed out, drew ever la rger numbers of adherents in the 1980s and especially the 1990s.71 Coulter and Fisher's book was c onnected to this subsequent literature, however, in the link that it proposed between v accination and neurological damage, especially that which resulted in lear ning disabilities and be havioral disorders in children. In A Shot in the Dark , Coulter and Fisher noted a parallel between pertussis vaccine-related damage and cases of autism, pointing out that infantile autism was first documented by doctors a few years after the pe rtussis vaccine was widely deployed in the U.S. One mother quoted by the authors descri bed the autistic-type behaviors in her son Richard, who suffered encephalitis following his third DPT shot and could assemble puzzles, but was unable to put on his own shoe s. \"I am convinced there is a connection between autism and pertussis vaccine,\" Rich ard's mother said. \"The relationship of uded Coulter and Fisher, \"deserves further investigation.\"72 The link between vaccines and autism was one of several which deserved further attention in the authors' estimation, but it was one of just a few that Coulter, an independent medical historian who had written extensively on alternative health, went on to investigate himself. For a subsequent book, he interviewed 60 parents of vaccine-damaged children in addition to the 100 he and Fisher had interviewed for A 71 See Chapters 11 and 12 in Whorton, Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America . 72 Coulter and Fisher, DPT: A Shot in the Dark , 124. 243 Shot in the Dark ; from these, he devised a theory that linked widespread vaccination to what he described as epidemic sociopa thic behavior in American society. Coulter's 1990 book, Vaccination, Social Violence, and Criminality: The Medical Assault on the American Brain , proposed that the side effects of vaccination were far more insidious than anyone had yet rec ognized, and had inflicted such widespread damage on the brains of children that they were responsible for the explosion of psychiatric disorders among American children since the 1950s, the social \"turmoil\" of the 1960s, increases in crime, alcohol, a nd drug abuse, and even the pathological behavior of serial killer and rapist Ted Bundy. Coulter gave special attention to the link between vaccination and autism, attributi ng the rise in autism to vaccine-induced encephalitis and determining proof of causa tion from the temporal correlati on between the first medical descriptions of autism in th e 1940s and the widespre ad use of pertussis vaccination just prior. He also offered an e xplanation as to why autism had so long been limited to the offspring of the upper class: until the 1970s, when new policies made vaccination widely available to all socioec onomic classes, he argued, only the wealthy could afford vaccines; thus, until then, only the wealthy had children with autism. To Coulter, a link between autis m and vaccination was indisputable\u2014despite the fact that scientists had yet to prove it.73 Coulter's 1990 volume was one of a wave of books on the hazards of immunization that came in the wake of A Shot in the Dark . Many of these were by observers who universally opposed all vaccin es on the premise that they had not 73 Harris Coulter, Vaccination, Social Violence, and Criminality : The Medical Assault on the American Brain (Berkeley: North Atlantic Books, 1990). 244 conclusively been proven safe, and that safe r routes to building i mmunity existed. (This position contrasted with that of Fisher, who repeatedly emphasized that she and her organization, Dissatisfied Parents Together, were not opposed to vaccines.) The authors of such books as Walene James' Immunization: The Reality Behind the Myth , Randall Neustaedter's The Immunization Decision , Neil Miller's Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective? and Viera Scheibner's Vaccination were not all natural healers by training, but all nonetheless shared a sense of skepticism about modern medicine paired with faith in the beneficence of nature. They worried about the artificial nature of vaccines, the lack of research on their long-ter m consequences, and their poten tial role in the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases , especially conditions affe cting the immune and nervous systems. James, a mother and writer living in We st Virginia, articulated a common fear when she wrote, \"recently I read that one out of eight infants born in the United States will grow up with some form of mental re tardation! Could mass immunization programs have something to do with this grim statistic?\"74 Neustaedter, a San Francisco homeopath and acupuncturist, argued that given the lack of research on the \"subtle and long-term damaging effects on the immune system and nervous system,\" a \"much more cautious approach to immunizations\" was warranted.75 New Mexico journalist and father Miller asserted that \"no one knows the long-term e ffects of tampering with the genetic codes 74 Walene James, Immunization: The Reality Behind the Myth (South Hadley, Mass.: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), 14. 75 Randall Neustaedter, The Immunization Decision: A Guide for Parents (Berkeley: North Atlantic Books, Homeopathic Educational Services, 1990), 8. 245 and delicate structure of the human organism.\"76 And Scheibner, an Australian physician whose vaccine-skeptical book was published in the U.S., argued that doctors and parents needed to \"start respecting na ture and recognize infectious diseases for the value they bring to children.\"77 Like Massachusetts herbalist and writer Jamie Murphy, she was a proponent of the view that even infectious diseases serve a pu rpose, and that nature gives all creatures everything they need to survive. To these and other writers, the emergence in the 1980s of so-called atypical measles, the term sometimes used to refer to measles that struck already-vaccinated children, was a troubling sign of nature's obstinacy. Recent history provided them with further exampl es in support of their overall view on the hazards of artificial vaccinati on: the \"pertussis vaccine catas trophe\" served as proof that vaccines could be proven harmful, to the neur ological system in particular, in the long run; the cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome induced by the 1976 swine flu vaccination campaign offered a similar example on a compressed time scale. Long-Held Doubts Confirmed A Shot in the Dark helped nudge vaccine skepticism to into the national spotlight and proved that there was an audience for in formation on vaccination alternatives\u2014or at least for more information on vaccines and si de effects than was generally provided in doctors' offices. But most authors of subs equent vaccine-critical books struggled to produce further evidence of harm. Several po inted to Coulter's theory, repeating the 76 Neil Z. Miller, Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective? A Parent's Guide to Childhood Shots (Santa Fe: New Atlantean Press, 1992), 49. 77 Viera Scheibner, Vaccination: 100 Years of Orthodox Research Shows That Vaccines Represent a Medical Assault on the Immune System (Santa Fe: New Atlantean Press, 1993), 92. 246 observation that the climbing prevalence of both autism and hyperactivity correlated with increased vaccination. And more and more e numerated the chemicals in vaccines and included details on their toxi city. Scheibner in 1993 wrot e that vaccines contained \"noxious substances\" including the well-known allergen thimerosal.78 Murphy, writing noted that vaccines cont ained a \"witch's brew\" of chemicals, including known carcinogens (formaldehyde), mercury (thime rosal), aluminum, and formalin. Murphy went on to describe tests th at had documented aluminum poisoning in factory workers and findings that led the EPA to classi fy formaldehyde as \"hazardous waste.\"79 Thimerosal, he pointed out, was a mercury de rivative, but no tests had been done to see how much of the well-known toxin remain ed in the body after vaccination. Pieces of evidence from other studies, however, did provide cause for concern. He described a study published in the British Medical Journal that had determined there was a \"theoretical risk\" of harm to patients r eceiving injections of immunoglobulin serum, which contained thimerosal. And he added that the mercury in once-widely used teething powders had been traced\u2014after seven d ecades of use\u2014to a condition called Pink Disease, a form of mercury poisoning, in ch ildren. Two years later, Neustaedter's book further condemned the preservative and linked it directly to neurological symptoms in vaccine damaged children. \"Mercury is a vi olent poison with many toxic effects,\" he wrote. He noted that it wa s toxic to the kidneys and cen tral and peripheral nervous systems and associated with tremors, demen tia, and memory loss, symptoms that closely resembled those seen in children who had reac ted adversely to the DTP, pertussis, and 78 Ibid., 259. 79 Murphy, What Every Parent Should Know About Childhood Immunization , 53. 247 Hib (Haemophilus influenza) vaccines, all of which contained thimer osal. He added that \"the neurologic toxicity symptoms caused by mercury compounds have a delayed onset after exposure, which may have significan ce for the suspected long-term neurologic symptoms of learning disabilities and beha vior disorders associated with pertussis vaccines.\"80 The increasing suspicion that the chemi cal components of vaccines\u2014especially thimerosal\u2014might be toxic to children's developing nervous systems took place against a backdrop of growing national concern about mercury exposure. Studies in the 1980s had revealed dangerously high levels of mercury in fish\u2014including some of the highest levels ever recorded in the U.S. 81 The findings, reported the New York Times , bore out environmentalists' warnings about pollutants in the food supply, whic h were especially troubling in light of growing fish cons umption among increasingly health-conscious Americans.82 As federal agencies examined the health and environmental effects of mercury emissions in the environment and debated the amount of mercury individuals could safely consume, state governments and community groups went ahead with steps to reduce exposure to the metal.83 States issued warnings agai nst consuming fish from local waters and passed regulations to monitor di sposal of mercury-c ontaining appliances; a 80 Randall ng an Informed Choice , 2nd ed.

Rice, and et al., An Assessment of Exposures to Mercury in the United States: Mercury Study Report to Congress (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1997). 248 few states even banned children's flashing sn eakers, which contained mercury switches.84 Advocacy groups began campaigns to phase out the use of mercury-containing thermometers and warned pregnant women and children to limit their canned tuna consumption.85 News reports on mercury throughout the 1990s emphasized that even \"tiny\" amounts of the metal were toxic, espe cially to the fetus, and that exposure could cause subtle but permanent damage; many ar ticles also quoted officials who compared mercury to lead and cigarettes, the hazards of which were long ignored and then suppressed. In a 1999 article that referred to \"mercury madness,\" Mothering notified readers about widespread warn ings against fish consumpti on and about the dangers of mercury thermometers, adding, \"It only takes a drop of the toxin to contaminate a whole lake\u2014or a child.\"86 The article in Mothering made no reference to mercury in vaccines, but it likely would have had it gone to pre ss just one month later. In July 1999, the Public Health Service and the American Academy of Pediat rics (PHS/AAP) issued a joint statement asking vaccine manufacturers to \"eliminate or reduce as expediti ously as possible the mercury content of their vaccines.\" The statement indicated that because of new vaccines and new vaccine recommendations, children we re at risk of \"exposure to a cumulative level of mercury over the first 6 months of lif e that exceeds one of the federal guidelines on methyl mercury.\" The risk of harm fr om this potential exposure was unknown but 84 Associated Press, \"Minnesota Ba ns Flashing Sneakers as Toxic,\" New York Times , May 10, 1994, A18. 85 Nancy Beth Jackson, \"Groups Debate Safety of Canned Tuna for the Very Young,\" New York Times , May 11, 1999, F14. 86 \"Ending Mercury Madness,\" Mothering , July/August, 1999, 11. 249 certainly smaller than the risk of infecti ous disease, the statement went on, but was nonetheless worth addressi ng \"because any potential risk is of concern.\"87 The determination that there was any risk from th e mercury in vaccines came as a result of an amendment to the Food and Drug Administ ration Modernization Act of 1997, which required the FDA to evaluate the mercury contents of drugs and biologic products.88 It also followed, by two years, the 1997 public ation of the Mercury Study Report, the EPA's examination of the health and envi ronmental effects of mercury emissions undertaken in response to the Clean Ai r Act Amendments of 1990. During\u2014and after\u2014 the production of the Mercury Study Report, th e safe exposure level was the subject of intense political debate; industry cited resu lts of a study finding no adverse effects among mercury-exposed children in fishing commun ities in the Seychelles, while public health and EPA officials cited a study of mercury-e xposed children in a fishing community in the Faeroe islands, whose motor function, la nguage and memory were all diminished compared to non-exposed children.89 The 1999 PHS/AAP statement on vaccines set off a second debate over the health effects of mercury exposur e, although this time the disagreement split the public health comm unity. Pediatrician and outspoken vaccine proponent Paul Offit called the statement a \"f lawed\" policy for elevating \"a theoretical 87 Public Health Service and American Academy of Pedi atrics, \"Notice to Readers: Thimerosal in Vaccines - a Joint Statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Public Health Service,\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Vol. 48, no.

In an editorial that explained and defended the call to remove thimerosal from vaccines, Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist and federal vaccin e advisor Neal Halsey equated the debate over mercury to that over lead, \"where se quential studies over many years provided evidence for subtle effects with progressively lower exposures.\"92 To Halsey, the theoretical nature of the risk of harm from thimerosal ha d to be balanced against the public's tolerance of that ri sk, which in his estimation was growing ever more limited. Furthermore, he posited, policie s to limit risk had to have the outward appearance of consistency. As he later explained to a New York Times reporter, his own position on the presence of thimerosal in vaccines was crys tallized while canoeing on a lake in Maine, where he came across a sign reading \"protect your children\u2014release your catch.\" It was problematic, he told the reporter, for the gove rnment to tell parents not to feed their children mercury-contaminated fish but to allow them to be injected them with the very same substance when it appeared in vaccines. 93 90 Paul Offit, \"Letter to the Editor: Prev enting Harm from Thimerosal in Vaccines,\" Journal of the American Medical Association 283, no. 16 (2000): 2104. 91 Stanley Plotkin, \"Letter to the Editor: Pr eventing Harm from Thimerosal in Vaccines,\" Journal of the American Medical Association 283, no. 16 (2000): 2104-2105. 92 Neal Halsey, \"Limiting Infant Exposure to Thim erosal in Vaccines and Other Sources of Mercury,\" Journal of the American Medical Association 282, no. 18 (1999): 1763-1766. 93 Arthur Allen, \"The Not-So-Crackpot Autism Theory,\" New York Times , November 10, 2002, F66. 251 Leslie and Robert Ball, the FDA scien tists who conducted the agency's risk assessment on thimerosal, also defended the recommendation to remove the preservative from vaccines for its feasibility in the in terest of limiting total human exposure to mercury and as a way of maintaining public confidence in vaccines. 94 Indeed, at the end of the century, lay confiden ce in vaccines did appear to be flagging. The National Vaccine Information Center (the new name gradually adopted by Dissatisfied Parents Together in the late 1980s) was operating with renewed vigor after finding a strong community of supporters among chiropractors a nd other alternative practitioners engaged in what Fisher called a \"fight fo r freedom of choice in healthcare.\"95 The fight, not coincidentally, followed close on the heels of the Clinton administra tion's push for health care reform and its announcement that it w ould fund an unprecedented federal initiative to vaccinate every child in the U.S. (see Chapter 3). In addition to well-publicized ideological arguments, the establishment of new means for monitoring vaccine side effects was also bringing incr eased attention to potential va ccine hazards. CDC officials reported that between 1997 and 1999, the national immunization hotline had been receiving increasing numbers of calls about vaccine safety. 96 The expansion of the immunization schedule\u2014vaccine s against chicken pox, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenza B, or Hib, had been added to th e childhood vaccination schedule in the late 1980s and 1990s\u2014had been drawing ire from parents and increased scrutiny from the 94 Ball, Ball, and Pratt, \"An Assessment of Thimerosal Use in Childhood Vaccines.\" 95 Lameiras, for a Choice: V accination - One Mother's Crusade,\" 32. 96 Bruce G.

But while many health officials blam ed a host of factors\u2014including newly recommended vaccines, the Clinton Administ ration's vaccination push, and the rise of the internet\u2014for fostering popular vaccine re sistance, most failed to acknowledge that the pile-up of negative, end-of-the-century vaccine news had served to repeatedly confirm skeptics' long-held fears and convictions. When The Lancet published a now- infamous report from British researchers noting a potential link between measles vaccination, bowel disease, and a form of autism, NVIC received the news with equanimity; after all, the organization's ne wsletter pointed out, the link between autism and vaccines was \"first reported in DPT: A Shot in the Dark fifteen years ago\" and had 97 Andrea Rock, \"The Lethal Dangers of the Billion Dollar Vaccine Business,\" Money , December 1, 1996, 148. 98 These events are discussed in more detail in the fo llowing chapter.

Alternative health writer and radio personality Gary Null welcomed the removal of thimerosal from vaccines but pointed out that \"vaccines may still contain formaldehyde (a highly carcinogenic material used to embalm corpses) and/or aluminum.\"101 To many critics, including physician Robert Sears (aka \"Dr. Bob\"), whose bris kly selling books and website offered twenty- first century parents an \"alternative\" schedul e for vaccinating their children, aluminum became the focus of continued vaccine fears.102 Calling it \"toxic and damaging to the brain and bones,\" it was the vaccine chemical that Sears, writing in La Leche League's New Beginnings magazine, said he was \"most concerned about.\" \"As more and more vaccines were added to the schedule, no one realized how much mercury or how much 99 National Vaccine Information Center, \"Autism and Vaccines,\" NVIC Newsletter , Spring 2000.

Its removal, if anything, merely proved to vaccine critic s that their long-held suspic ions had been justified. A Crisis of Faith In the first decade of th e twenty-first century, newspapers, television, and magazines continued to ramp up reporting on vaccine worries and doubts. In interviews with reporters, parents cite d a long list of increasingl y familiar-sounding reasons: they feared vaccines might cause au tism, allergies, or asthma, a nd they didn't understand the need to vaccinate their children against diseas es, like pertussis or hepatitis B, that they perceived as extinct or rare. \"It's not like we are in the 1800s anymore,\" one mother who chose not to vaccinate her daughter told the New York Post . \"Epidemics are a thing of the past.\"104 But many of those who resisted vaccina tion mandates in the 2000s cited another reason as well. As movie actress and someti mes pro-vaccination spokesperson Amanda Peet said, trying to explain the vaccination resistance among her peers, \"there's this child-rearing trend - only feed your kids or ganic food, detoxify your house. And there's a lot of anti-corporate fervor, an ti-pharmaceutical company fervor.\"105 Indeed, while vaccination resistance became increasingly visibl e in the early years of the twenty-first 103 Robert Sears, \"Childhood Vaccines: Making an Educated Decision for Your Children,\" New Beginnings , January - February, 2008, 4-9. 104 Levine, \"Calling the 'Shots' in Kids' H ealth: Vaccination-Fearing Parents Battle City Immunization Laws,\" New York Post , March 4, 2001, 8. 105 Donald McNeil, \"Book Is Rallying Re sistance to the Antivaccine Crusade,\" New York Times , January 13, 2009, D6. 255 century, many of its staunchest adherents were portrayed, by themselves and by the media, as those who, like the vaccine-questioning readers of Mothering three decades before, embraced a \"natural\" or \"green\" lif estyle, eschewing pesticide-laden foods, pledging themselves to breastfeeding, and placin g trust in the virtues of a healthful diet, exercise, clean air and water, and a balanced, respectful relationship between the body and the environment. This mode of child-rearing was as much a \"t rend\" as it was an expression of faith. In his 2004 book Faith in Nature , environmental historian Th omas Dunlap traced the parallels between American environmentalis m and (primarily Christian) religions. Environmentalism, like religion, \"invokes th e sacred,\" \"refuses to choose between intellect and emotion,\" and \"gives moral weig ht to the apparently trivial of daily life,\" Dunlap argued.106 Environmentalism and reli gious belief systems both, furthermore, grapple with questions of hu man existence and conceptualize life and the universe as a complex, quasi-mysterious whol e whose intricate work ings are beyond the comprehension of humanity. Over three decad es of resistance, vaccine skeptics applied this environmental belief system to beliefs about vaccines and their encounter with human bodies and the environment, conceptua lizing the immune system as sacred (much in the way environmentalists portray wild erness) and intricately complex beyond human understanding; as something, in the words of a vaccine-skeptical mom from Texas, not to be \"tampered\" with.107 106 Thomas R. Dunlap, Faith in Nature: Environmentalism as Religious Quest , Weyerhaeuser Environmental Books (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2004), 4, 149. 107 Redman-Copus, \"The Hot Dialogue on Immunizations Continues.\" 256 For many vaccine skeptics, nature offe red an answer to the increasingly complicated question of whether, and agains t which diseases, parents should vaccinate their children\u2014as well as the broader questi on of how to care for their children in a complex and incomprehensible modern worl d. The notion that everything in nature\u2014 viruses, bacteria, and dis eases included\u2014served an unknowable but crucial purpose was more comforting than the prospect of gambling with haphazard and ever-changing scientific knowledge. Not infrequently, vacci ne skeptics attributed the sanctity of everything in nature to the workings of a hi gher power; in this view, nature was not akin to a deity but was a deity. As the mother of a vaccine damaged son explained in A Shot in the Dark : \"I thought I was being a good parent to give him that shot. If I had known about the risks, if I had been give n an option, I might have taken my chances with the natural disease....I was so happy when he was born. He was so beautiful, with ten toes a nd ten fingers. God gave me a perfect child, and man, with his own ways, damaged God's perfect work.\"108 Many parents who eschewed vaccines expres sed a desire, like the mother above, to leave (or have left) their child's fate in nature's (or a god's) hands. In the 2000s, this desire evolved into a ritual of sorts with the revival of an event called the chicken-pox party: \"A little playing, some conversati on and some passing of the pox to the next family,\" as one Virginia mother put it.109 The development of a vaccine against chicken pox in the 1980s was followed in the 1990s by the adoption of state laws requiring proof of vaccination or immunity for children ente ring day care or school. Media reports soon 108 Coulter and Fisher, A Shot in the Dark: Why the P in the DPT Vaccination May Be Hazardous to Your Child's Health , 220. 109 Shannon Henry, \"A Pox on My Child: Cool!,\" The Washington Post , September 20, 2005, F1. 257 shared the news that parents in Britain were avoiding the chicken pox vaccine by hosting \"disease parties.\"110 In the U.S., internet discussion boards soon began to buzz with talk of the parties, and in 2004, Mothering published advice on establishing and proving immunity the \"natural\" way. Varicella, the chicken pox virus, \"is communicated easily through saliva,\" the authors wrote, so they suggested having child ren at a \"Pox Party\" share whistles.111 Parents who chimed in onlin e suggested passing around kazoos, popsicles, lollipops, or M&Ms while the gath ered children played games or did art projects. Over the next few years, popularity of the parties swelled, achieving a cult-like following and considerable pr ess in Marin County, Califor nia; Brooklyn, New York; and elsewhere. When interviewed by the media, mo thers who hosted or took their children to pox parties expressed a desire to give their ch ildren natural, lifel ong immunity that they, in turn, could pass on to their children. Th e language parents chose to describe their thinking on the subject was plainly evocative of a form of religion: \"I believe in the body's ability to build immunity and heal itse lf,\" said a Brooklyn mom and registered nurse who hosted a chicken pox party to spread her son's infection.112 \"I'm of the belief system that by putting a synthetic, or a dead virus, into a body as an inoculation creates 110 Jon Bowen, \"Germs Invited to the Party,\" Chicago Sun-Times , August 6, 2000, 8. 111 Brian Wimer, Jacquelyn Emm, and Deren 112 the Play Dates Are Fun, but Itchy,\" New York Times , August 21, 2005, B5. 258 an ongoing response to trying to build up immunity to that, and that ultimately it creates a situation where you have an overworked im mune system,\" said a California mom.113 In a brief essay on the shared characteristics between environmentalism and religion, historian William Cronon noted that the two also share a predilection for predictions of disaster as \"a platform for cr itiquing the moral failings of our lives in the present.\"114 In this way, too, pox partiers expressed a characteristically environmental and simultaneously religious view . The California mom's belief that vaccination would ultimately destroy her child's naturally well-functioning immune system was illustrative of the commonly held notion that widespread, mass vaccination was a long-term disaster in the making. Through vaccination, wrote holis tic health advocate Rhody Lake, \"the natural immunity built into the human organism by the wisdom of nature is destroyed a little more in each generation.\" 115 Parents who saw ultimate doom in acceptance of the chicken pox vaccine saw not only a progressive , cumulative assault on natural immunity in the making but also (because the duration of the shot's protection was unknown) the manmade creation of a generation of women with no maternal antibodies to pass on to their own children; an epidemic of shingles , the more serious mani festation of chicken pox virus infection in adolescen ts and adults; and a generatio n of daughters who could be susceptible to chicken pox during their ow n pregnancies, putting two generations removed at risk of birth defects. 113 Richard Halstead, \"Marin Fights Outbreak of Chicken Pox,\" Marin Independent Journal , November 15, 2006, 15. 114William Cronon, \"Forward,\" in Faith in Nature: Environmentalism as Religious Quest , ed. Thomas R.

Many parents who a voided the chicken pox vaccine in favor of natural infection (some vaccine critics, it's worth noting, argued that pox parties themselves were far from \"natural\") often saw nature as capable of unleashing epidemics of more intractable, untreatable conditions and diseases. The unpredictability of nature was a widely held environmental value by the end of the tw entieth century, as anthropologists Willett Kempton, James Boster , and Jennifer Hartley haved pointed out; it was also one that had long-informed vaccine reception.116 McBean, in 1957, believed that the \"infusion of poison injected into th e blood stream of the masses only served to intensify the disease in some cases, suppress the symptoms in others and create new and more serious diseases in stil l others....grow[ing] into a Fran kenstein monster of immense proportions.\"117 When an altered form of measle s began to appear in previously vaccinated children in the 1970s and 1980s, Sche ibner and other vaccine critics lamented that where nature had created measles (and other infections) to strengthen children's immune systems for the future, humanity had mu tated it into \"an especially vicious form of measles.\"118 Even the earliest discussions of th e use of chicken pox vaccine to prevent the infection in children provoked doomsday predictions that invoked nature as deity: \"Vaccines, as we learned recently about the proposed chicken pox vaccine, often produce not health but more serious diseases,\" wrot e Roman Catholic priest and author Andrew 116 Willett Kempton, James S.

In broad terms, vaccine resistance at the end of the twentieth century and beginning of the twenty-first was informed by long-standing ideas about nature and the environment and rela ted ideas about the body as environment and the body's health in relation to its external environment. From new environmentalism specifically, vaccine resistance in this period borrowed rhetoric and a set of prevailing ideas concerning, for example, the shortcomings of modern science and the uncertain fate that awaited those who adopted new technol ogies with only a lim ited understanding of their long-term consequences. Prominent li nes of thinking that overlapped between environmental sentiment and vaccine beliefs al so reflected a set of shared, traditionally American liberalist values. Historian Roderick Nash, writing in the 1980s, argued that American environmental ethics had come to be domi nated by the ideas that nature has both 119 Andrew Greeley, \"Searching for Nature's 'Message',\" Chicago Sun-Times , August 1, 1993, 40. 120 Mitman, Murphy, and Sellers, \"Introduction: A Cloud over History,\" 16. 261 \"intrinsic value\" and \"the righ t to exist,\" the latter an idea that placed environmentalism (an albeit \"radical\" movement) \"squarely in the mainstream of American liberalism.\"121 With the expansion of both the immunizati on schedule and immunization programs in the 1990s, vaccine safety groups increasingly advoc ated for their freedom to make health care decisions for their children, arguing that this was a right of parents upon which the state should not intrude. Historia ns have placed this demand, too, within the tradition of American emphasis on the importance of liberty and equality. At the same time, many vaccine critics argued for the importance of letting childhood diseases run their course\u2014 arguing, that is, for the \"inherent value\" of these creations of nature. The belief that everything in nature has a purpose may not have been as common among vaccine skeptics as was the belief in a parent's right to choose her or his child's health care, but both beliefs have direct correlates in Amer ican environmentalism as well as American political ideology as a whole. Even if every last germ was not of valu e, other forms of nature were nonetheless valued by many vaccine resisters for their salu brity. Like the nineteenth century settlers described by historian Conevery Bolton Vale ncius, modern vaccine critics often used environmental metaphors to describe the body, re ferring to it as \"terra in\" or \"soil,\" or likening its vaccinated condition to a po lluted piece of land or body of water.122 The body, like a pristine wilderness, was seen by many as standing the best chances of survival in an untouched state, sustaine d on pure water and whole, unprocessed foods\u2014 121 Roderick Nash, The Rights of Nature: A Hist ory of Environmental Ethics , History of American Thought and Culture (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989), 12. 122 Valencius, The Health of the Country: How American Settlers Understood Themselves and Their Land . 262 the fruits of nature, that is, not the products of humanity. Those who rejected vaccines because they subscribed to al ternative healing practices generally ascribed to nature a wisdom and beneficence\u2014and sometimes ev en a religious authority\u2014perceived by centuries of nature cure adherents before them.123 To cross nature could weaken the body and indeed the species, either by eroding \"n atural\" immunity or prompting the mutation of existing diseases into more horrific maladi es. It also smacked of modern man's hubris, as Moskowitz indicated when he argued that vaccination was a misguided \"attempt to beat nature at her own game, to eliminate a problem that cannot be eliminated, i.e., the susceptibility to disease itself.\" 124 Like processed foods and pesticides, v accination was also a viewed by vaccine critics as a product of humanity; thus it wa s an unwelcome addition to the internal environment, whose finely tuned balance it was thought to permanently disrupt. And just as the internal envi ronment existed in a precarious e quipoise, human bodies were also seen as one component in a larger environment, their health directly related to material flows in the world they inhabited. Envi ronmental pollution, made visible by the environmental movement, served not only as a metaphor but as a window into the state of the modern body. As one vaccine critic put it: \"The ethylmercury injected in our recently vaccinated child goes into the diaper and into the landfill. If we continue to use mercury, like quicksilver, it escapes us. Whether we use it in chlorine production, amalgam fillings, vaccines, or thermometers, the mercury gets away from us and sneaks into our 123 Whorton, Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America ; Dunlap, Faith in Nature: Environmentalism as Religious Quest . 124 Moskowitz, \"Immunizations: The Other Side.\" 263 food chain, into our bodies, into our babies.\"125 Bodies, that is, existed in a continuum with the environment; thus, there was little difference between environmental mercury and mercury in the body. As historians Mar kowitz and Rosner have shown, the histories of other materials, such as l ead, silica, and vinyl chloride had made this pattern clear by the end of the twentieth century, building a case for the application of the precautionary principle in environmentalism and in public health. 126 Perceiving vaccines as toxic\u2014a notion that environmentalism helped embed in late-twentieth-century American vocabulary\u2014vaccine skeptics argued that th e same principle should guide vaccination recommendations and use as well. The fact that the disruption of internal or external balance wa s not immediately or even easily perceptible was of no consequen ce to vaccine resister s, who had inherited from new environmentalist thinking the rhetoric with which to articulate their fears: that vaccines, like lead or DDT or cigarettes or cyclamates, would someday be proven to have caused long-term damage, no matter how dramatic or how subtle. Damage might be difficult to detect and harder still to prove, but time and again history had shown that the modern world was the root cause of modern illnesses. In this light, it seemed more prudent to add vaccines to the list of modern technologi es responsible for modern 125 Ann Montgomery, \"The Insidious Elixir - Mercury, Sources, Effects and What to Do About It,\" Women and Environments , 2003, 19-22, 21. 126 Markowitz and Rosner, Deceit and Denial: The Deadly Politics of Industrial Pollution ; David Rosner and Gerald Markowitz, \"Industry Challenges to th e Principle of Prevention in Public Health: The Precautionary Principle in Historical Perspective,\" Public Health Reports 117, no. 6 (2002): 501-512. The precautionary principle is a policy orientation that emphasizes taking caution when proposed activities pose a threat to the environment or health, even if that threat is not scientifically well-defined or understood; the principle also shifts the burden of proof of safety or harm onto proponents of the activity. Timothy O'Riordan and James Cameron, Interpreting the Precautionary Principle (London: Earthscan Publications Ltd., 1994). 264 epidemics, among them radiation, lead, cigarettes, thalidomide, DES, and even infant formula, than to wait for the accumulation of evidence that would undoubtedly be long in coming. \"We have seen [this problem] when the sons and daughters of the mothers who were given diethylstilbestrol showed up seri ously ill a generation later, and when infants whose mothers were given thalidomide were born deformed,\" wrot e a vaccine-critical breastfeeding advocate in a letter to the British Medical Journal . \"How long must a clinical trial be to ensure safety? One generation? Two? More?,\" she went on, implying no certain answer. 127 The logic leading to the conclusion that a cautious approach to vaccination was warranted was adopted not only by back-to- the-land types, organic food devotees, or even alternative medicine followers. Fisher and other members of Dissatisfied Parents Together, for instance, did not discard modern, orthodox medicine outright as part of an allegiance to natural healing methods; nonethel ess, they argued th at vaccines, though oft- touted as a triumph of humanity's mastery ov er nature, were insuffi ciently studied, their hazards poorly understood and possibly unknowable within the limits of modern science and technology. Both environmentalism and vacci ne resistance thus bore out the tensions between modern faith in the triumph of hu man logic and reasoning over the natural world and modern skepticism regarding humanity's ability to resist the unpredictable and constantly evolving nature of that world. For skeptics who believed vaccination was to blame for ever-escalating rates of modern epidemics, environmentalism was both a justification and an e xhortation to question th e assurances of those in authority that new 127 Nikke Lee, \"Letters - Breas tfeeding Should Be Promoted,\" British Medical Journal 321 (2000): 108. 265 technologies were fully vetted and safe. Coulter and Fisher illustrated this line of thinking when they quoted Rachel Carson at the very end of A Shot in the Dark : \"Just as we have polluted our enviro nment with man-made chemicals, we may well be polluting oursel ves with a myriad of man-made vaccines in our quest to eradicate all disease a nd infection from the earth. In her exploration of the ways that American s have polluted the air, water, and earth with synthetic chemicals, Rachel Carson concluded in Silent Spring that 'The choice, after all, is ours to make. If, having endured much, we have at least asserted our 'right to know,' and if, knowing, we have concluded that we are being asked to take senseless and frightening risks, then we should no longer accept the couns el of those who tell us we must fill our world with poisonous chemicals; we should look about and see what other course is open to us.'\" 128 Enduring ideas about the natu ral world cast childhood diseas es in an almost rosy light, imbuing them with value a nd entrusting their cour se and cure to nature. At the same time, environmentalist ideas cast the vaccines to prevent those diseases in a harsh light, characterizing them as hastily adopted tec hnologies with unknown risks. From those who believed vaccination was inherently worthwh ile but for a few unsafe vaccines, to those who believed that vaccination was inherently harmful in any form, contemporary ideas about nature and the environment played a profound role in shaping their views and positions at the turn of the twenty-first century. 128 Coulter and Fisher, A Shot in the Dark: Why the P in the DPT Vaccination May Be Hazardous to Your Child's Health , 219. 266 Chapter 6 \"Do We Really Need Hepatitis B on the Second Day of Life?\" Vaccine Acceptance at the E nd of the Twentieth Century In 1999, amidst what Time magazine called a national case of vaccine \"jitters,\" young children's vaccination rates reached \"reco rd high levels,\" according to the Centers for Disease Control.1 Ninety-six percent of children we re protected against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus, 93% were vaccinate d against Haemophilus influenza B (Hib), 91% had shots against measles, mumps, and r ubella, 90% against polio, and 88% against chicken pox and hepatitis B.2 These figures represented a substantial increase in immunization rates since 1992, the year that saw the lowest vaccination rates since the Carter administration's Chil dhood Immunization Initiative. Th at year, close to 20% of children weren't fully protected against diphthe ria, pertussis, tetanus, or measles, and close to 30% hadn't been vaccinated against polio.3 (Figures didn't yet exist for immunization against Hib, chicken pox, or hepatitis B, for all th ree had yet to be added to the recommended immunization schedule for children.) Despite the 1992 low, child vaccination ra tes generally rose from the 1970s into the 2000s, thanks in large part to the policie s that emerged from the Clinton and Carter 1 Jaroff, \"Vaccine Jitters.\" 2 Centers for Disease Control, \"National, State, and Urban Area Vaccination Coverage Levels among Children Aged 19 - 35 Months, United States, 1999,\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 49, no. 26 (2000): 585-589. 3 World Health Organization, \"WHO/UNICEF Estimat es of National Immunization Coverage: Estimated Coverage by Country, Year, and Vaccine,\" Immunization Surveillance, Assessment, and Monitoring , Last updated January 27, 2011.

During the same period, however, doubts about the wisdom of vaccination were in creasingly expressed by a cross section of Americans. The coexistence of these two contradictory but tightly intertwined trends\u2014 growing vaccination skepticism and growi ng vaccination compliance\u2014is testimony to the fact that vaccination resi stance is often an ideologi cal expression of libertarian discomfort with mounting state power. But the picture at the end of the twentieth century was also more complex than that, for many vaccine critics in this period asserted that they weren't anti-vaccine nor anti-big government. Rather, what th ey wanted was even greater government oversight of vaccine safety, free of corner-cutting, corruption, and conflicts of interest. These sentiments are apparent in the discourse over hepatitis B vaccination; this discourse is also generally illustrative of the nuanced and conflicted ways in which Americans viewed individual vaccines and vaccine policies in a time when the number and variety of shots for child ren was rapidly multiplying. The hepatitis B vaccine, which consists of a series of three shots, was one of four immunizations added to the schedule of recommended childhood vaccines in the last decade of the twentieth century. A blood-borne virus that attacks th e liver, hepatitis B was, like mumps, dramatically reframed by the introduction of subsequent vaccines against the infection and by the sociopolitical contexts into which these vaccines were introduced. From the early 1980s, when the fi rst hepatitis B vaccine was introduced, to the late 1990s, when the vaccine became required for most children in the country, hepatitis B morphed from a foreign obscurity of little direct relevance to most Americans, to a ubiquitous AIDS-like sc ourge, to a cancer-causing inf ection spread by teenage lifestyles. Over the same period of time, its v accine represented, at first, the promise of a 268 new era of pharmaceuticals; subsequently, ag ainst a backdrop of accumulating vaccine scares, it came to signify to vaccine critics the fallibility of all vaccines and vaccination policies. In addition to illustrating the persistent potential for vaccines to reframe the diseases they prevent, the story of hepatitis B also demonstrates the full realization of the \"new era of vaccination\" ushe red in three decades earlier, when the routine, universal vaccination of children against a variety of severe and mild infections got underway with the support of federal guidelines and financ ing. The widespread adoption of policies requiring the universal vaccination of all children against hepatitis B\u2014despite varying individual risks\u2014is a testament to the consol idation of federal aut hority in the arena of vaccination policy, as well as the centrality of convenience and cost effectiveness in shaping such policy. When these evolving pol icies ultimately landed upon the universal vaccination of infants, they placed responsibil ity for the nation's future physical and economic health on the shoulders of the c ountry's very youngest citizens. But this conceptualization of the hea lth citizenship responsibiliti es of children was not easily maintained. This policy evolution and the ne w era of vaccination it made manifest took place against a backdrop of eroding scientific authority. From the 1970s through the 1990s, the doubts raised by the women's, e nvironmental, and c onsumer movements, described in Chapters 4 and 5, had considerably chipped away at lay faith in scientific, government, and corporate pronouncements on the safety and efficacy of vaccines generally. Such doubts were at times overridden; in the case of hepatitis B vaccination, they were temporarily diminished by the AI DS epidemic, enthusiasm for genetically engineered drugs, and support for national he alth reform, among other factors. But doubts 269 nonetheless simmered from the moment the fi rst hepatitis B vaccine was introduced, and they reached a boiling point at the end of the century, as state laws requiring the vaccine's administration to all infants were being implemented. In the negative media and legislative attention hepatitis B immunizatio n attracted at the very end of the century, the vaccine thus became a fulcrum for the incr easingly public debate about the safety of vaccines and the wisdom behind U. S. vaccination policy generally. \"A Disease Affecting Health Workers, Male Homosexuals and Drug Addicts\" While hepatitis had long been a concern of health officials, the disease wasn't a terribly familiar one to most Americans in the decades prior to the hepatitis B vaccine's 1981 approval by the Food and Drug Administra tion. Two distinct forms of hepatitis, A and B (formerly \"infectious\" and \"serum\" he patitis, respectively) had been known since the 1950s. But countless cases of serum hepa titis had gone undetected, in large part because of the vague symptoms it caused. Inf ection with hepatitis B virus may or may not cause debilitating fatigue, nausea, and loss of appetite. These acute symptoms may or may not be fatal, and those who do recover may or may not become chronic carriers. Carriers, in turn, may or may not become vi ctims, decades later, of hepatitis-induced cirrhosis or liver cancer. 4 Hepatitis B's fairly mundane acute symptoms\u2014its attendant fatigue, nausea, and loss of appetite\u2014meant that for decades it was conflated with other conditions. In the 1970s, however, armed with a new set of diagnostic tools, researchers enumerated for the first time more than 200,000 new cases in the U.S. each year and 4 See Introduction and Chapter 11 in Baruch S. Blumberg, Hepatitis B: The Hunt for a Killer Virus (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2002). 270 more than 200 million carriers worldwide.5 Epidemiological studies were also now able to identify those at highest risk of the disease. In addition to health care workers, the list included hemophiliacs, prisoners , gay men, injection drug users, sex workers, native Alaskans, and immigrants from sub-Sa haran Africa and southeast Asia. Those new diagnostic tools emerged from the work of research physician Baruch Blumberg, who in the 1960s identified a pr otein in the blood of Australian aborigines, which he dubbed the Australia antigen. Austra lia antigen floated freely in the blood of people infected with serum hepatitis, and in 1967, the researchers determined that Australia antigen was in fact a surface protein on the virus that caused the disease. In related work, Blumberg and his colleagues found that monke ys injected with highly purified Australia antigen di d not come down with serum hepatitis; the discovery suggested that noninfectious but still protective material c ould be separated from the virus itself. The basis for a novel vaccine had been found.6 As development of a vaccine against th e infection accelerated in the late 1970s, Blumberg and other infectious disease expe rts predicted that an effective immunization would save hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lives.7 But news of the potential vaccine, and of hepatitis B its elf, rarely reached lay audi ences over the course of the 5 William Muraskin, \"Hepatitis B as a Mo del (and Anti-Model) for AIDS,\" in AIDS and Contemporary History , ed. Virginia Berridge and Philip Strong (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), 108-132. 6 See Chapter 5 in Blumberg, Hepatitis B: The Hunt for a Killer Virus . 7 Ibid., 134-136. See also B. S.

The disease had isolated moments in the spotlight: In 1974, the host of the television show Today's Health came down with hepatitis B when a surgical patient's blood splashed in his eye; he chronicl ed in detail the disease's \"mean, sneaky malevolence\" on TV and in print.8 Two years later, hepatitis B made headlines again when Blumberg shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work on the disease.9 The press also reported on the 1979 outbreak of hepatitis B among youth who shared needles to take the recreational dr ug methylene deoxyamphetamine.10 Such stories confirmed for the public the picture then emerging from epid emiological studies, which was that the disease posed a risk only to specific subsets of the populati on, namely surgeons and drug users. On the eve of the hepatitis B vaccine's 1981 introduction, most lay Americans thus had little reason to worry about the virus. Early press reports on the shot affirmed this notion. In 1980, the CBS evening news repo rted that hepatitis B struck developing countries in Asia and Africa in \"epidemic proportions,\" wher eas in the U.S. it affected mainly \"patients on dialysis, medical pe rsonnel, and people living in institutions.\"11 When news anchor Dan Rather reported on the new vaccine, he announced that it had been approved for \"a disease affecting h ealth workers, male homosexuals, and drug addicts.\"12 On NBC, the evening news anchor told Americans, \"hospital workers get it, 8 Norman Pastorek, \"Hepatitis,\" September, 1974, 46-69. 9 Boyce \"Sketches of Two Winners of Nobel Prizes in Medicine,\" New York Times , October 15, 1976, 13. 10 \"A Wave of Death from Hepatitis,\" Newsweek , August 27, 1979, 72. 11 CBS Evening News, September 29, 1980, Vanderbilt Television News Archive. 12 CBS Evening News, November 16, 1981, Vanderbilt Television News Archive. 272 so do drug addicts, mental patients, homosexuals, and millions of people in Africa and Asia.\" The network's subsequent segment on the vaccine focused largely on the \"medical adventure story\" of the virus's discovery, which a reporter recounted over grainy, choppy footage of Aborigines in nativ e attire, further reinforcing the otherness of the disease.13 Historian William Muraskin has argued that popular representations of hepatitis B in this period were deliberately construc ted by the medical prof ession, acting in self interest. Having been identified as a high-risk group themselves, health care workers, in Muraskin's analysis, endeavored to define he patitis B infection as an issue \"private\" to their profession and outside the public's pur view. The media, reliant on the medical community for information about the virus, re ported what they we re told: that gays, injection drug users, and certain immigrants and refugees were at high risk, and that the spread of hepatitis in iatrogenic settings was controlle d through the use of disposable gowns, masks, gloves, and other hygienic practices.14 The health care profession's internal policy\u2014of voluntary testing for carrier status\u2014became the implicit policy toward the population at large, too. The upshot of this policy, according to Muraskin, was twofold: it prevented \"hysteria and discrimi nation of carriers,\" but it also hampered public awareness of the extent of the ep idemic and the true risk of infection.15 Muraskin's assessment downplayed the role of bench scientists, epidemiologists, independent-minded reporters, and other Americans in constructing hepatitis B's popular 13 Ibid. 14 See for example W. Szmuness et al., \"Hepatitis B Vaccine in Medical Staff of Hemodialysis Units: Efficacy and Subtype Cross-Protection,\" New England Journal of Medicine 307, no. 24 (1982): 1481-1486. 15 William Muraskin, \"The Silent Epidemic: The Soci al, Ethical, and Medical Problems Surrounding the Fight against Hepatitis B,\" Journal of Social History 22 (1988): 277-298. 273 image (however faint) in this period. Represen tations of the virus as one that posed little threat to \"average American s\" were common in the late 1970s and very beginning of the 1980s\u2014but not merely because doctors willed it this way. This portrayal of hepatitis B made sense given the nation's health priorities at the time. Cancer and heart disease were by far the country's top kill ers; heart attacks alone caused 300,000 deaths a year. Hepatitis, meanwhile, appeared way down th e list; in 1981, many more people died of homicide and ulcers than died of hepatitis of any type.16 A disease doesn't have to cause high mortality, of course, to cap ture national attention, but he patitis also failed to align with nation's other health preoccupations: skyrocketing hospital co sts, environmental scares like the meltdown at Three Mile Isla nd, and a relentless \"flurry of strange new ailments,\" including Legionnaire's disease, Ly me disease, Reye's Syndrome, and Toxic Shock Syndrome.17 When, in 1981, a new ailment appeared with characteristics similar to hepatitis, however, hepatitis's public image unde rwent a radical reconstruction. In light of AIDS, control of hepatitis would take on a new sense of urgency. Two Novel Vaccines The hepatitis B vaccine that was appr oved by the FDA in 1981 was an unusual product in the history of vira l vaccine development. The va ccine didn't contain live, weakened virus (like the Sabi n polio vaccine) or killed, de natured virus (like the Salk polio vaccine). Instead, Heptavax B, deve loped by Merck, contained painstakingly 16 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nati onal Center for Health Statistics. Health Data Interactive.

This novel procedure earned Hepatvax B the title of the world's first \"subunit\" vaccine agai nst a virus\u2014meaning that it stimulated an immune response by using just a part, or subuni t, of the virus and not the virus in its entirety.18 In a display of awe and enthusiasm fo r scientific discovery, the same news reporters who had downplayed the disease's ri sk for average Americans played up, in the next breath, the new vaccine's development and its novel form. The vaccine, after all, was fairly big news: As news anchor Dan Rath er pointed out, it was the \"first completely new viral vaccine in ten years;\" it was also the \"first vaccin e ever licensed in the United States that is made di rectly from human blood.\"19 Newsweek called its blood-derived antibodies \"ingenious\" and magazines from Time to Glamour called the vaccine a \"medical breakthrough.\"20 Fervent reports in popular and scientific journals proclaimed that hepatitis B would soon join such we ll-known pathogenic villai ns as smallpox and polio as a problem of the past.21 This enthusiastic rhetoric was soon damp ened by yet another medical discovery. The clinical trials that had tested the hepa titis B vaccine's efficacy in the late 1970s had 18 The vaccine's development is described in Galambos and Sewell, Networks of Innovation: Vaccine Development at Merck, Sharp & Dohme and Mu lford, 1895-1995 , 181-193. 19 CBS Evening News, November 16, 1981. 20 \"Hepatitis Hope,\" Time , October 13, 1980; Jean Seligma n, Vaccine for Hepatitis,\" Newsweek , October 13, 1980, 132; Carl Sherman, \"Hepatitis: Why It's So Common,\" Glamour , March, 1981, 268-270. 21 See for example Seligman, \"A Vaccine for Hepatitis .\"; Lawrence Altman, \"Tests of Hepatitis B Vaccine Show Nearly Complete Rate of Protection,\" The New York Times , September 29, 1980, A1. 275 included only gay men, who had been identified as being at high risk of the infection.22 When, in 1982, the federal Advisory Comm ittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued its customary recommendations on who should receive the new vaccine, the list included those considered to be at highest ri sk for the disease, including health care workers with frequent blood contact; prisoners ; patients and staff of institutions for the \"mentally retarded\"; hemodialysis patients; in jection drug users; immigrants from eastern Asian and sub-Saharan Africa; and sexually active gay men.23 In the flurry of commentaries that followed in the medical lit erature, several reports highlighted the unique susceptibility of gay men to the infection. An editorial in JAMA identified the same list of groups to target with the v accine, but added that \"the highest HBsAG [hepatitis B antigen] prevalence in the Un ited States is among male homosexuals.... Frequency of intercourse, the number of se xual partners, and the prevalence of anal intercourse all contribute to this high prevalence.\"24 Indeed, hepatitis B-infected gay men along with other carriers of the virus had been frequent donors of blood for the vaccine\u2014a fact that gay media outlets initially reported on with pride. But the plasma-der ived vaccine's approval in late 1981 was quickly followed by emergent reports of a mysterious new illness causing \"immune 22 W. A.

The announcement spurred fears that th e new vaccine was contaminated with the pathogen causing AIDS, increasing ly presumed to be a virus.26 In 1982 and 1983, the press reported that gay men and injection dr ug users were frequent blood donors for the vaccine, and that many health care workers were refusing the vaccine themselves for this very reason.27 (Noted one physician to her daughter , in confidence: \"I know where the vaccine comes from.

And who knows what they've got.\"28) The CDC moved quickly to address su ch fears, announcing in 1983 that of 200,000 individuals vaccinated ag ainst hepatitis B since 1982, none had come down with AIDS.29 There were, however, cases of AIDS in gay men who had participated in the vaccine trials, and the theory that the hepati tis vaccine (among other vaccines) played a part in AIDS's appearance and spread woul d gain momentum among certain segments of the lay population as the 1980s progressed.

This new link, a recitation of the similarities between the two viral infections, would persist in popular and scientific discourse for we ll over a decade. The analogy be tween AIDS and hepatitis B infection had been drawn early on by epidemio logists working to di scover the causative agent of AIDS. Both diseases, scientists not ed, appeared to be transmitted sexually and showed a pattern of infection among in jection drug users and blood transfusion recipients. When the Centers for Disease Cont rol (CDC) identified in 1983 the groups at \"high-risk\" of AIDS\u2014gay men with multip le sex partners, IV drug users, Haitian immigrants and hemophiliacs\u2014these closely mi rrored the list of thos e earlier reported to be at high risk of hepatitis B.30 These parallels were repeatedly echoed by the media. As a 1985 cover story on AIDS in Time pointed out, both diseas es were scourges of \"drug addicts, blood recipients and gay men,\" and sc ientists were still uncertain as to whether hepatitis B was a \"co-agent of AIDS or merely tagalong infection.\"31 As AIDS gripped the nation's attention, inte rest in hepatitis also picked up. Media coverage pointed out not only how hepatitis B virus was similar to the virus that caused AIDS, but also how it was worse: fifteen times more prevalen t in the population, 200 times more infectious, far more stable in the environment, responsible for far more deaths, and, unlike the AIDS viru s, spread by casual contact.32 But the public could take 30 Centers for Disease Control, \"Current Trends Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Update -- United States \" Morbidity and Mort ality Weekly Report 32, no. 24 (1983): 309-311; \"Recommendation of the Immunization Practices Adviso ry Committee (ACIP) Inactivated Hepatitis B Virus Vaccine.\" This pattern has also been noted by historian Gerald Oppenheimer. See Gerald Oppenheimer, \"In the Eye of the Storm: The Epidemiological Construction of AIDS,\" in AIDS: The Burdens of History , ed. Elizabeth Fee and Daniel Fox (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988), 267-300. 31 Claudia Wallis, \"AIDS: A Growing Threat,\" Time , August 12, 1985. 32 See for example Cheryl Sacra, \"A Vaccine for Lovers,\" Health 21 (1989): 47. 278 solace, said the vice chair of the National F oundation for Infectious Diseases, in the fact that a vaccine existed to keep this \"cousin of AIDS\" at bay.33 This message, that the hepatitis B vaccine was a beacon of hope in a ti me of fear, was oft-repeated in the press. There's no cure for AIDS, Gay Community News told readers, but there is one for hepatitis B, which kills five times as many people each year.34 Mademoiselle issued the same message: \"There is no AIDS vaccine yet, but there are two new ones against hepatitis B.\"35 That second hepatitis B vaccine, widely av ailable by the late 1980s, was a vastly different product from the first, blood-deriv ed vaccine. Recombivax HB, the genetically engineered hepatitis B vaccine approved in 1986, contained viral pr oteins not harvested from infected patients in the clinical setting, but manufactur ed by genetically engineered yeast in the lab. The vaccine was hotly anticipated by medical and public health professionals for its potential to address the high cost and \"theoretic al disadvantages\" of plasma-based vaccines.36 And they weren't the only ones excited about a vaccine made with recombinant DNA. As news of Recomb ivax HB's impending approval began to leak, press reports hailed its potential to prove that genetic engineering would revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry.37 Scientists and the re porters who quoted them called biotech vaccines generally \"exciting and im aginative,\" and referred to the hepatitis 33 Sanford Kuvin, \"Vaccination Can Halt Epidem ic of Hepatitis B, Cousin of AIDS,\" New York Times , April 9, 1989, E24. 34 \"Hepatitis, Health, and the Hard Sell,\" Gay Community News , September 10, 1983. 35 Natalie Geary, \"Health News: Hepatitis B,\" Mademoiselle , April, 1993, 120. 36 Alter, \"The Evolution, Implications, an d Applications of the Hepatitis B Vaccine.\" 37 \"Uncorking the Genes: Biotech Stocks Just Coming into Own, Analyst Says,\" Barron's National Business and Financial Weekly , May 5, 1986, 10-16. 279 B vaccine specifically as a \"pioneering product.\"38 Researchers told the New York Times that biotech shots were \"cutti ng edge weapons\" that would el iminate not only hepatitis B, but also AIDS and malaria.39 The business press breathlessly reported on the race between \"tiny\" California biotech firms to produce the world's first genetically engineered vaccine, and when Chiron's R ecombivax was approved, Venture magazine crowned it one of the best entrepreneurial ideas of 1986.40 The approval of Recombivax HB\u2014the first genetically engineered vacci ne and the third genetically engineered pharmaceutical to make it to market\u2014was heralded on the front pages of the New York Times , the Los Angeles Times , the Wall Street Journal , and elsewhere for ushering in what FDA commissioner Frank Young called a \"new era in vaccine production.\"41 By the mid 1980s, that era had been long awaited. In the 1960s and 70s, lawsuits over polio vaccine tainted with live virus had prompted half the nation's vaccine manufacturers to pull out of the market al together\u2014a fact the business press reminded readers of as they reported on the new vaccine.42 More recently, publicity of the side 38 Claudia Wallis, \"Made-to-Order Vaccines,\" Time , October 31, 1983; Janice Castro, \"A Breakthrough for Biotech,\" Time , August 4, 1986. 39 Harold Schmeck, \"The New Age of Vaccines,\" New York Times Magazine , April 29, 1984, 58. 40 See for example Judy Packer, \"Chiron Nears Sale of New Hepatitis Vaccine,\" San Jose Business Journal 3, no. 41 (1986); Tom Post et al., \"The Year's Best Entrepreneurial Ideas,\" Venture 8, no. 12 (1986): 6. 41 Boffey, \"U.S. a Gene tically Altered Vaccine.\"; Marlen e Cimons, \"First Human Vaccine Produced by Genetic Engineering Okd by FDA,\" Los Angeles Times , July 24, 1986, 1; Joe Davidson, \"Lab- Made Vaccine for Hepatitis B Is Cleared by FDA,\" Wall Street Journal , July 24, 1986, 1. Some vaccine critics also saw genetic engineering as the answer to risks posed by vaccination. See National Vaccine Information Center, \"Pertussis Vaccine Research Update,\" Vaccine News 5, no. 1 (1990): 5. The first genetically engineered drug, a recombinant form of human insulin, was approved by the FDA in 1982; the approval of recombinant human growth hormone followed in 1985.

See also Chapter 2 of this dissertation. 280 effects of pertussis vaccine (described in Chapter 4) had drawn increased popular attention to the risks of vaccination generall y. The same year that Recombivax hit the market, President Ronald Reagan, under pr essure from consumer groups, signed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act into law, establishing a compensation program to reimburse families for the care of those harmed by recommended vaccines. The genetically engineered hepati tis B vaccine was therefore enthusiastically received by investors, the pharmaceutical industry, and hea lth professionals not only because it held the promise of a new generation of vaccines, but also for its potential to address persistent safety concerns. Scientists and drug company representatives alike also emphasized that the new vaccines would be cheaper, and w ould finally allow for the marketing of hepatitis B vaccine in developing countries, wh ere it was much more sorely needed than it was in the United States. 43 In the words of the Wall Street Journal 's editorial board, Ch iron's discovery had brought an end to the days when vaccine de velopment was \"an inexact scientific art.\"44 Because the new hepatitis vaccine did not c ontain a whole virus, it \"just can't do any damage, period,\" said a microbiologist at the FDA.45 Nodding implicitly toward past and present fears, researchers promised that ge netically engineered vaccines eliminated the \"risk of actually gett ing herpes, hepatitis B or influen za from the injection, since the 43 This was a long-anticipated advant age of genetically engineered vacci nes, particularly the genetically engineered hepatitis vaccine. However, when it was fi rst introduced, Heptavax B (the plasma-derived vaccine) was the most expensive vaccine ever mark eted. See for example Alter, \"The Evolution, Implications, and Applications of the Hepatitis B Vaccine.\" 44 Editorial, \"Science and Demagoguery,\" Wall Street Journal , July 31, 1986, 1. 45 Dori Stehlin, \"Hepatitis B: Available Vaccine Safe and Underused,\" FDA Consumer Magazine , May, 1990. 281 viruses themselves are not present in the formula.\"46 FDA Commissioner Young echoed these sentiments in a press statement he made upon Recombivax's approval: \"These techniques should be...extended to any virus or parasite,\" sai d. He went on to state that while the plasma-derived vaccine had never posed a risk of AIDS, the new \"lab-made vaccine\" should further reassure people. He also strongly urged those at high risk of hepatitis B to take advantage of this \"new life-saving protection.\" 47 A Push for Widespread Vaccination Young's plea came as public health o fficials were bemoaning stubbornly low hepatitis B vaccination rates. In the five ye ars since the ACIP had recommended that gay men, injection drug users, health care worker s, and select immigrants be vaccinated against the infection, hepatitis B preval ence had not only not decreased, but had increased, with rates particularly high among young adults.48 Incrementally, federal recommendations evolved in response. Instead of targeting all risk groups, however, the ACIP's new guidelines targeted only those gua ranteed to have an encounter with the health care system\u2014namely pregna nt women and their newborns.49 In 1984, the ACIP had recommended that all \"high-risk\" pregnant women be screened during prenatal care 46 Wallis, \"Made-to-Order Vaccines.\" 47 Associated Press, \"FDA Approves Gene-Engineered Hepatitis Vaccine,\" The Dallas Morning News , July 24, 1986, 5A. 48 Centers for Disease Control, \"Surveilla nce Summary Viral Hepatitis -- 1984,\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 36, no. 3 (1987): 42-43. 49 The targeting of women identified through their sexual (in this case reproductive) behavior is reminiscent of countless historical attempts to curb the spread of sexually transmitted infections by detaining and treating women, especially prostitutes, over men. See for example Brandt, No Magic Bullet: A Social History of Venereal Disease in the United States since 1880 ; Porter and Porter, \"The Enforcement of Health: The British Debate.\" 282 visits for hepatitis B, and if found positive, that their infants be immunized at birth to prevent them from harboring the virus.50 But the plan had little impact on total hepatitis B prevalence, because high-risk women were di fficult to identify and insurers weren't always willing to cover the cost of screeni ng them. As a result, th e ACIP later noted, the U.S. continued to add another 3,500 chroni c hepatitis B carriers (the unimmunized infants of infected mothers) to the population each year. To get around the difficulty of identi fying high risk women, in 1988 the ACIP recommended that all pregnant women be tested for hepatitis B, and, if positive, their infants vaccinated within tw elve hours of birth to preven t transmission to the next generation.51 But disease incidence continued to pers ist at high rates. And at the same time, the demographics of the infected seem ed to be changing: among the infected, the proportion of homosexuals had decreased si gnificantly since 1982, while the proportion of drug users and heterosexuals with no discernable risk fa ctor had increased. When it released these figures, scientists in the CDC' s hepatitis division suggested that the only way to combat the disease would be to im munize all infants, all adolescents, or both.52 The ACIP agreed and in 1991 altered its guidelines yet again, this time recommending that all infants be vaccinated against the disease at birth.53 50 Centers for Disease Control, \"Recommendation of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP): Postexposure Proph ylaxis of Hepatitis B,\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 33, no. 21 (1984): 285-290. 51 Centers for Disease Control, \"Recommendations of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee - Prevention of Perinatal Transmission of Hepatitis B Viru s: Prenatal Screening of All Pregnant Women for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen,\" Morbidity and Mort ality Weekly Report 37, no. 22 (1988): 341-346, 351. 52 M.

What was new, howev er, was that in the case of hepatitis B, children were being vaccinated at birth\u2014long before they coul d engage in the types of social activities, like school or play, generally implicated in the spread of contagious disease. By the early 1990s, the message that just a bout everyone was at risk of hepatitis B came to dominate media reports on the disease. Outlets from the Philadelphia Tribune to Good Housekeeping reported that a third of people who came down with the disease were not in any of the known risk groups.56 Redbook warned readers that hepatitis was \"spreading fast\" and the Boston Globe noted that the infection was spread by sharing Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP),\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 40, no.

The measles epidemic that swept the country in 1989 and 1990, infecting more than 50,000 people and causing hundreds of deaths, was the worst rash of measles the nation had seen in over a decade.43 Because of falling immunization rates generally, the incidence of rubella and pertussis was also on the rise. When a special federal advisory panel stud ied the measles outbreaks, their resulting White Paper (described in Chapter 3) conc luded that the epidemic was driven by low immunization rates among pre-school-aged children, which were the result of multiple components\u2014costly vaccines, inadequate insu rance policies, and other barriers\u2014of an overall broken health care system. 44 \"This isn't a measles problem, it's a systems 57 Leslie Laurence, \"Beware the Quite Killer,\" Redbook , October, 1991, 24, 28, 32; Sandy Coleman, \"Q&A with Leslie Hsu, South Cove Health Center in Chinatown,\" Boston Globe , Feb 15, 1998, 2. 58 Janice Hopkins Tanne, \"The Other Plague: Potentia lly Deadly Hepatitis Is Fi fteen Times More Common Than AIDS,\" New York , July 11, 1988, 34-40. 59 Ibid., 35. 285 problem,\" said renowned vaccine expert and panel member Donald A. Henderson.60 The Republican-controlled White House disagreed: \"The facilities are there...the vaccines are there...make sure your child is immunized,\" Pr esident Bush urged parents in a speech at the White House Rose Garden.61 As an incentive for the pare nts deemed most responsible for the rash of epidemics, his administra tion proposed tying welfare payments to children's immunization status.62 In the partisan dispute that erupted in response to the welfare proposal, administration officials maintained that in dividual citizens needed to assume more responsibility for their persona l health, while left-leaning me mbers of the public health profession accused the White House of \"punishing the poor\" and spending more on six hours of the Gulf War than it would take to curb measles.63 The administration's proposal never passed, but while the political battle over measles control raged, some vaccine critics began questioning the measles vacci ne as well as the constantly evolving guidelines on who should get it and when. In response to rising measles rates, the ACIP had revised its vaccination recommendations , adding a second recommended dose to the one dose previously advised for children, a nd adding preschoolers, college students, health care personnel and intern ational travelers to the list of those who should get the shot. The changes were necessary, th e committee wrote, to address the two causes of 60 Okie, \"Vaccination Record in U.S. Falls Sharply.\" 61 Devroy, \"Bush Announces New Push to Improve Vaccination Programs.\" 62 Robert Pear, \"Proposal Would Tie We lfare to Vaccinations of Children,\" New York Times , November 29, 1990, A1. 63 Phyllis Freeman and Anthony Robbins, \"An Epidemic of Inactivity,\" New York Times , July 10, 19971, A19; Jeremy Waldron, \"There We Go Again, Punishing the Poor,\" New York Times , December 12, 1990, A22. 286 nationwide measles outbreaks: unvaccinated pr eschoolers and vaccine failure. Among the roughly 17,000 measles cases that had occu rred between 1985 and 1988, 42% were in vaccinated people; in some school districts, measles outbreaks occurred even though 98% of the children were immunized. Scientists ha d a few explanations for why this might be: vaccine-induced immunity might be fading with time, and some children might be getting vaccinated at too early an age, when their maternally inherited measles antibodies were still present and could inte rfere with vaccine response. 64 But the committee's solution\u2014more shots\u2014struck some as confusing if not downright illogical.65 \"Does it make sense to offer booster shots of any sort if a single shot of the vaccine has not been shown to do the job?\" asked one mother, to whom the vaccine suddenly seemed \"too experime ntal, too ineffective, and too risky.\" 66 The risks of the measles vaccine, usually given as MMR, seemed to be proven by the outbreaks themselves; further, it was increasingly difficu lt for parents to balan ce these risks against the risks of the disease. In its revised gui delines, the ACIP described measles as a \"severe\" disease that caused en cephalitis in 1 of every 1,000 cases and death in 1 of every 1,000 cases.67 This rate of complications was dramatically higher than that measured when measles vaccination began in the 1960s, noted some attentive critics, who 64 Centers for Disease Control, \"Measles Preventi on: Recommendations of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP),\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 38, no. S-9 (1989): 1-18. College students were presumed to be at risk because the vacci ne they received back in the 1960s, scientists had concluded, was too weak to confer lasting immunity. 65 \"Are Vaccines Generally Detrimenta l to the Human Defense System?,\" Townsend Letter for Doctors & Patients , February/March, Mothering Disease Control, \"Measles Preventi on: Recommendations of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP).\" 287 questioned whether the fallible vaccine was actu ally responsible for having created this more severe disease. Joanne Hatem, a phys ician who had herself suffered an adverse reaction to rubella vaccination, noted that wh ile measles had indeed become a far more serious disease, the vaccine had its own fl aws, including a far-from-perfect rate of protection and its own risk of encephalitis and death. She advised a tempered approach to immunization, advising parents to give thei r children the MMR shot at 15 months, and then, if a booster became necessary, to get only the component of MMR that needed boosting.68 As some parents and physicians receive d the more-shots mantra with caution, proponents of a more robust imm unization infrastructure found an effective ally in newly elected President Bill Clinton, who spent the spring of 1993 championing the cause of childhood immunization.69 The administration's Vaccines for Children program (described in Chapter 3) appropriated $300 million to immunize Native American children, those on Medicaid, and those without insurance coverage or coverage for vaccines. The program also provided states with added funds for vaccination and provided safeguards guaranteeing states the ability to purchase vaccines at federal contract prices. 70 That same spring, Clinton signe d a proclamation supporting National Preschool Immunization Week, an annual week of coordinated efforts to fully vaccinate preschoolers with all federally recommende d vaccines, including the vaccine against 68 Joanne Hatem, \"MMR Update,\" NVIC News 1, no. 3 (1991): 9. 69 See Chapter 3 for an extensive discussion of Clinton's childhood immunization initiative. 70 Gary Freed and Samuel Katz, \"The Comprehensive Childhood Immunization Act of 1993,\" New England Journal of Medicine 329, no. 26 (1993): 1957-1960. 288 hepatitis B.71 In the context of a national dialogue about the broken health care system, which Clinton kept front and center during his fi rst season in office, the cost-efficiency of vaccination generally, and hepa titis B vaccination in particular, took on new salience. Vaccinating young children against hepatitis B saved more money than efforts to vaccinate any other group could ever save, health economists calculated, simply because it prevented the most chronic infections. 72 The enactment of the Vaccines for Children program coincided with yet another broadened set of hepatitis B vaccine reco mmendations by the ACIP. The committee now urged that all unvaccinated 11- and 12-year olds be protected against the virus, as well as all children under age 11 who were either P acific Islanders or who lived in households with immigrants from countries with high rates of hepatitis B. Health officials were blunt in justifying the widespread vaccination of adolescents. While universal infant vaccination would ultimately obviate the vaccin ation of adolescents and adults, in the meantime, vaccinating pre-teens would drive down disease incidence more quickly. Targeting immigrant children was necessary, they argued, because they continued to experience \"high rates\" of hepatitis B infectio n: 2% became infected each year and 2 to 5% became chronic carriers of the virus.73 The numbers may not have seemed objectively high, but they did seem excessive to those like Barbara Hahn, a deaf interpreter who, in her inability to trace her own hepatitis B infection, pinned it on immigrant children. 71 Office of the Press Secretary, Remarks by the Pr esident at Reading of Immunization Proclamation. 72 Harold Margolis et al ., \"Prevention of Hepatitis B Virus Transm ission by Immunization.

Is that how I got this dis ease?\" wondered Hahn. \"Did I get it from a child who ran into me on the playground or from the little girl who was upset and bit me while I was working at the Cincinnati public schools?\"74 This refocused attention on the infectious status of immigrants came at a time when concerns about immigrants, the resurgence of infectious diseas es, and the costs of health care were both prominent and intertwined. During his fi rst year in office, as he attempted to overhaul health care generally a nd access to vaccines in particular, President Clinton entered into a battle with Congress over his campaign-trail promise to overturn a 1987 ban on the immigration of people infected with HIV.75 Heated opposition to Clinton's plan reflected fear s about an impending wave of immigrants from Haiti, a country with a high rate of HIV-infected pe ople, as well as the nation's resurgence of tuberculosis, which was fre quently attributed to \"immigrants and travelers.\"76 Arguments against the importation of add itional infections frequently ci ted the burdensome costs of providing health care to the chronically ill. Growing resistance to the prospect of adding immigrants to these ranks was exemplified by California's passage of Proposition 187, 74 Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Po licy, and Human Resources of the Committee on Government Reform of the House of Representatives, Hepatitis B Vaccine: Helping or Hurting Public Health? , 106th Congress, 1st session, May 18, 1999. 75 Editorial, \"AIDS and Immigration,\" The Washington Post , February 12, 1993, A26; Clifford Krauss, \"Senate Opposes Immigration of People with AIDS Virus,\" New York Times , February 19, 1993, A11. 76 Robert Greenberger, \"Clinton Team Seeks Policy to Aid Haiti and Avert Feared Surge of Emigration,\" Wall Street Journal , January 4, 1993, A5; Laura Hawkins, \"Facing TB--in the Mirror,\" The Washington Post, January 12, 1993, 17. 290 which proposed severely limiting illegal immigrants' access to public services.77 As historian Alan Kraut has pointed out, such policies were simply \"old wine in new bottles,\" as throughout American (and even human) history, immigrants have often been held to blame for outbreaks and epidemics\u2014 real or imagined\u2014and the resources they consume.78 Immigration anxieties framed the context in which federal hepatitis B vaccination recommendations took shape, even if they weren't directly cite d by the state-level hepatitis B vaccination laws that soon followe d. As state health boards and legislatures began taking steps to mandate the hepatitis B vaccine for infants, ki ndergartners, and 7th graders, many instead attributed these st eps directly to the Vaccines for Children program. Minnesota's vaccine task force credit ed the Clinton program for the extra funds and discount pricing that made it feasible to require the hepatitis B vaccine for 7th graders.79 State health officials in Colorado, Loui siana, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere also credited the administration for making it possibl e to require the new vaccine for students, 77 Roberto Suro, \"Proposition 187 Could Open Pandora's Box for Gop,\" The Washington Post , November 11, 1994, A24; Bruce Nelan, David Aikman, and David Jackson, \"Not Quite So Welcome Anymore,\" Time , December 2, 1993. 78 Alan M.

When states such as Colorado, Idaho, California, and Pennsylvania mandated the vaccine for pre-teens, health o fficials and lawmakers cited as justification the growing popularity of tattoos and body piercing.81 Adult attitudes toward teenage body piercing, a trend that expl oded in the nineties, exemplified what historian Paula Fass has referred to as the socially constr ucted perception of \"the rocking, highly sexualized teenager.\"82 In countless articles and talk s hows devoted to the topic of body art in the late 1990s, parents and doctors ex pressed bewilderment and concern over the trend and its hazards: accord ing to the reports, children as young as 11 and 12, often influenced by celebrities, were getting pier ced and tattooed in record numbers and facing skin rashes, swelling, scar tissue, tetanus, HI V, and hepatitis B as a result. \"This fad communicates status, fash ion-hipness\u2014and , \"Vaccination Line Long as School Opening Nears,\" The Advocate (Baton Rouge, La.) , August 19, 1993, 1A; Reuter s, \"Hepatitis B Vaccine for Babies Urge d; Most of the Affected Americans Are First Infected as Young Adults,\" The Philadelphia Inquirer , October 18, 1995, A12; Michael Romano, \"Colorado Will Add Hepatitis B to Requi red Inoculations for Schoolchildren,\" Rocky Mountain News , April 20, 1996. 81 Andrea Vogt, \"CDA Schools First in Idaho to Offer Hepatitis B Shots,\" Idaho Spokesman-Review , October 7, 1997, A1; Diane Eicher, \"Hepatitis B Vaccine Carries a Qu andary; Debate Rages over Necessity of Wide Usage,\" The Denver Post , June 27, 1994, F1; Tina Nguyen, \"Parents Need to Get Started on Schools' Hepatitis B Mandate,\" Los Angeles Times , December 26, 1998, 1. 82 Fass, Children of a New World: Society, Culture, and Globalization , 215. 292 advising parents, \"Get kids vaccinated. If they haven't had hepatitis B shots, talk to their doctors.\"83 Body piercing was often explicitly lin ked to sex\u2014pop singer Janet Jackson relayed that with piercing \"you get this great sensation...it can be very sexual.\"84 The fad, which was also linked in many reports to an increased risk of smoking, alcohol, and drug use, came to epitomize oversexualized youth at risk of a complex set of dangers and diseases. Fortunately, comment ators noted, at least one of the risks of body art was preventable with a vaccine. Immunization against hepatitis B in this period thus became a bulwark against both immigrant-imported infections and the carelessly assumed hazards of youth sex and fashion trends. And although the rhetoric that had tightly linked hepatitis B to AIDS less than a decade earlier was beginning to di minish, the association between the two persisted in educational materials urging teens to get vaccinated. A 1994 educational campaign by the National Foundation for Infecti ous Disease featured \"sexpert\" Dr. Ruth, who continued to inform audiences that hepa titis B was \"100 times more infectious than HIV.\"85 As the 1990s progressed, however, characte rizations of hepatit is B as a sexually transmitted disease increasingly gave way to characterizations of the virus as a preventable infection linked to cancer. \"This is a very safe and effective way to avoid what is a terrible disease that causes cancer and other chronic problems,\" said the head of Colorado's health board regard ing shots against hepatitis B.86 Indeed, this particular 83 \"A Piercing Look,\" Prevention , November, 1996, 46. 84 \"If Body Piercing Is So Hazardous, Why Is It So Popular?,\" Jet, April 19, 1999, 56. 85 Eicher, \"Hepatitis B Vaccine Carries a Quandary ; Debate Rages over Necessity of Wide Usage.\" 86 Romano, \"Colorado Will Add Hepatitis B to Required Inoculations for Schoolchildren.\" 293 portrayal of the infection became increasingly prom inent as parental resistance to the vaccine began to emerge, as it did when Colorado attempted to mandate the vaccine for school. Rejecting Hepatitis B Vaccine The majority of state laws and regula tions mandating hepatitis B vaccination for children went into effect between 1993 and 1998. Their pass age was largely streamlined by federal enthusiasm for universal vacci nation and funding support for recommended vaccines, in addition to cultural preoccupatio ns with the lifestyle s of body-pierced youth and disease-harboring foreigners. But while many of the laws and regulations were uneventfully adopted, a few minor debates di d erupt. When Colorado's health board proposed requiring the shot for kindergartners and seventh graders in 1996, doctors and health officials were split on the issue. As with mumps nearly three decades before, health and medical experts in the state we re neither united nor entirely clear on the urgency of vaccinating children against hepa titis B. Some noted that the American Academy of Pediatrics had advised the imm unization of all older children only \"where resources permit.\" Some pointed out that the disease was unlikely to spread among elementary schoolchildren, \"unless you have an infected child who's a biter or who has a blood spill.\" 87 Others trotted out arguments about th e risk-taking behaviors of teenagers: \"We have a lot of children in this comm unity who feel they're invincible...they experiment with sex and drugs, then die young because they get chronic hepatitis....Since this is something we can prevent, we should pr event it,\" said a director of the El Paso 87 Eicher, \"Hepatitis B Vaccine Carries a Quandary ; Debate Rages over Necessity of Wide Usage.\" 294 County health department.88 But that argument didn't hold water for everyone. \"Just because we CAN vaccinate, does that mean we always should? It's a worthy public debate,\" said the hepatitis B project mana ger for Colorado's state health department.89 Those in favor of the health board's proposal prevailed. By the fall of 1997, parents of all of the state's incoming kinderg artners and seventh-graders had to either provide proof of their children's hepatitis B immunization or sign a form claiming a medical, religious, or personal exemption to the requirement.90 But as the requirement went into effect, popular opposition began to mount. In 1999, Patti Johnson, a member of the Colorado State Board of Education, be gan a campaign to encourage parents to question the vaccine, citing the small number of hepatitis B cases in young children (279 in 1996) and the large number of hepatitis B vaccine-related injuri es reported to the federal government (24,776 between 1990 and 1999). Drug companies Merck and SmithKline Beecham hadn't adequately tested the vaccine for long-term safety in children, she charged, and too few had questione d why this inadequately tested vaccine was being given to children to stop a diseas e that affects \"IV drug users, prostitutes, sexually promiscuous persons, health care wo rkers exposed to blood, and babies born to infected mothers.\" 91 At The Denver Post , columnist Al Knight repeatedly chimed in on 88 Rick Ansorge, \"State Adds Hepatitis B to Immuniza tion List - Shots Required for Schoolkids Beginning 1997,\" The (Colorado Springs) Gazette , April 26, 1996, 1. 89 Eicher, \"Hepatitis B Vaccine Carries a Quandary ; Debate Rages over Necessity of Wide Usage.\" Emphasis in original. 90 Diane Eicher, \"HBV Shot Series Must Start Now,\" The Denver Post , April 14, 1997, F2. 91 Patti Johnson, \"Need for Hepa titis B Vaccine Questioned,\" Rocky Mountain News , July 12, 1999, 30A. That same year, Johnson led a separate campaign targeting the use of Ritalin, the widespread use of which she believed was symptomatic of society's over-medica tion of children. See Marcela Gaviria, \"Medicating Kids,\" in Frontline (PBS, 2001). Chiron was no t a target of these complaints because its vaccine was developed in cooperation with and subsequently marketed by Merck. 295 the vaccine's hazards, informing readers that New Jersey's governor, Christie Whitman, had vetoed a bill to require hepa titis B vaccines for schoolchildren.92 Whitman cited the vaccine's unknown duration of protection in her decision to postpone signing the bill; in Colorado, her \"refusal\" to sign was described as a bold act that questioned the wisdom of vaccinating the young to prevent a disease brought on by adult behavior.93 Vaccine doubts weren't new to Colorado, the birthplace of Mothering magazine. By the late 1990s several of the state's co mmunities had become re nowned for their large numbers of children claiming personal exemp tions to vaccine requirements and for the outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, like pertussis, which sometimes resulted.94 Nor were doubts specific to the hepatitis vacc ine new, either in Colorado or elsewhere. Years before state laws requiring the vaccine for children went into effect, the National Vaccine Information Center (DPT was by now referring to itself as DPT/NVIC) worried about the lack of studies examining the shot 's long-term effects on children; they also questioned why the vaccine should be given to all infants, most of whom didn't belong to any of the identified risk groups.95 92 Al Knight, \"The Limits of Mandatory Medicine,\" The Denver Post , March 4, 1999, B11; Al Knight, \"Pinning Down the Risks of Vaccinations,\" The Denver Post , August 5, 1999, B9. 93 Donna Leusner, \"Some Bills Perish in Governor's Pocket,\" The Star Ledger , January 21, 1998, 15. 94 Todd Hartman, \"Vaccinations' Success Backfiring - Thousands in Colorado Forego Shots,\" The Gazette , January 19, 1997, 1; Arthur Allen, \"Bucking the Herd,\" The Atlantic Monthly , September, 2002, 40-42. Overall vaccination coverage in this period was generally high in Colorado and the rest of the U.S.; 75 to 90% of children were fully vaccinated (against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, Hib, hepatitis B and varicella) in each state, altho ugh at 75.8%, Colorado's coverage rate was lower than that of most other states.

In 1998, the national media reported on France's decision to halt hepatitis B vaccination becau se of fears the shot caused neurological damage, particularly multiple sclerosis.96 Early in 1999, the television news program 20/20 asked whether hepatitis B was \"smart prev entive medicine or an unnecessary risk.\" The report featured several adults, including se veral health care workers, whose neurological and autoimmune symptoms, resemb ling multiple sclerosis, arthritis, lupus, and Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome, set in after get ting the vaccine. The broadcast also focused in depth on the story of Lyla Rose Belkin, a healthy infant who went to sleep the night she received the vaccine and never woke up.97 In the spring of 1999, stirred by these reports, a House Committee held hearings on hepatitis B vaccine safety concerns. The vaccine was constantly in the headlines once again, not for its promise of an infectious disease-free future, but for its potential to ha ve contributed to deat hs and disabilities in the present. A Backdrop of Mounting Skepticism Worries about the hepatitis B vaccine were shaped not only by individuals' experiences with the vaccine itself, but by the culmination of decades of unanswered doubts about vaccines generally. As the 1990s had progressed, an increasing amount of 96 See for example Agence France-Presse, \"Fra nce Ends Program of Hepatitis B Shots,\" New York Times , October 3, 1998, A4. 97 \"Who's Calling the Shots?,\" in 20/20 (ABC News, 1999). See also Anita Manning, \"Now Parents Fear Shots; Kids in USA Get 21 Shots before Start of 1st Grade,\" USA Today , August 3, 1999, 1A. 297 evidence appeared to indicate that the very safety concerns that Dissatisfied Parents Together had rallied to address a decade before still persisted. And more and more evidence suggested that the risks of pertussi s vaccination were only th e tip of the iceberg. In 1996, on the ten-year anniversary of th e passage of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, Money magazine conducted an investiga tion into the DPT vaccine and ran a lengthy condemnation of vaccine business and policy in America under a damning headline: \"THE LETHAL DANGERS OF THE BILLION- DOLLAR VACCINE BUSINESS.\"98 DPT shots still caused brain damage and deaths, they reported, and though a safer shot had been available for decades, U.S. vaccine makers hadn't brought it to market because it would increase producti on costs and cut into profits. DPT's dangers weren't the only ones they dug up: oral polio va ccine had been the only cause of cases of the disease in the U.S. for nearly two decades , the magazine reported, and it remained in use even though a safer, injected (and more expensive) version was available. On top of that, scientists had long known that polio va ccines contained monke y viruses that had been linked to cancer and might have even more insidious effects, none of which had been adequately studied. Federal health offici als and pediatricians needed to \"stop hiding facts\" from parents and the public, conclude d reporter Andrea Rock, so that they could understand the true risks of vaccina tion and make informed decisions. 99 The worries recounted in the Money investigation echoed many of the same complaints that the readers and editors of Mothering and the members and followers of Dissatisfied Parents Together had been voi cing for years. DPT/NVIC had long asserted 98 Rock, \"The Lethal Dangers of the Billion Dolla r Vaccine Business.\" Emphasis in original. 99 The investigation reported that DPT vaccine cau sed brain damage in 1 in every 62,000 children immunized and one to two deaths a year. Ibid., 150, 164. 298 that vaccine injuries pitted individuals in a David-versus-G oliath-like battle with \"the most powerful and wealthy segments of our society: the pharmaceutical industry, organized medicine, and the federal government.\" 100 For years after winning the passage of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, DPT had continued to lobby arduously for the U.S. approval of an acellular pertussis vaccine, which had been adopted by Japan in the 1970s in response to pertussis vaccine sa fety concerns, and which they argued was safer than the whole-cell v accine available in the U.S. 101 In 1988, members of the group had attended a National Institutes of Health conference on the vaccine, where they criticized the design of studies comparing the U.S. and Japa nese vaccines and ominously warned health officials of an impending \"cris is\" if they didn't m ove more quickly to provide Americans with a safer pertussis shot. 102 The implied crisis was not just one in which ever more children would suffer traceable reactions to the shot, but one in which ever more cases of the disease would occur as more and more parents avoided the shots for their children out of fear.103 In the late eighties and early nineties, DPT/NVIC's efforts had remained largely focused on advocating for a safer pertussis va ccine; they also pressed hard for the 100 Dissatisfied Parents Together, \"Pre sident Reagan Signs Vaccine Inju ry Compensation and Safety Bill into Law,\" DPT News 3, no. 1 (1987): 1. 101 See for example Ibid; Dissatisfied Parents Togeth er, \"CDC and FDA Claim Little Difference between U.S. Whole-Cell and Japan's Acellular DPT Vaccines,\" DPT News 3, no. 2 (1987): 10; Dissatisfied Parents Together, \"U.S. Vaccine Of ficials Criticize the Japanese Acellular Vaccine - DPT Cites Study Flaws,\" DPT News 4, no. 1 (1988): 4; Dissatisfied Parents Together, \"Center Hosts International Scientific Workshop,\" Vaccine News 5, no. 1 (1990): 1, 9; Dissatisfied Parents To gether, \"Pertussis Vaccine Research Update,\" Vaccine News 5, no. 1 (1990): 5. 102 Dissatisfied Parents Together, \"U .S.

But each time their efforts were st ymied\u2014which was frequently\u2014the members regrouped and organized in ways that brough t increasing national at tention to vaccine risks. They held protests, marching with th eir vaccine-injured children outside the White House, the CDC, and state cap ital buildings. They ran information booths at fairs across the country; erected billboards telling parents to \"Know the Risks!\"; and mailed newsletters far and wide feat uring summaries of the latest court rulings on vaccine injuries, breaking scientific research on v accine hazards, and sentimental memorials to children reportedly killed or injured as a re sult of vaccines. One particular scientific development that the group kept track of were reports that polio vaccines contaminated with monkey virus were responsible for the cen tury's most fearsome emergent infection: HIV. Theories that HIV had been deliberate ly introduced to ki ll gays or blacks appeared shortly after the vi rus itself did. Beginning in the mid-1980s, commentators in both the black and gay media frequently sp eculated on a link betwee n the emergence of HIV and the mass vaccination of blacks ag ainst smallpox; some linked the virus's emergence and spread to the widespread vacc ination of individuals against hepatitis B.104 Dermatologist Alan Cantwell's books\u2014 Queer Blood and AIDS and the Doctors of Death \u2014blamed the origin of AIDS on the hepat itis B trials conducted in gays in the 1970s.105 Biochemist Jack Felder, author of AIDS: United States Germ Warfare at Its 104 John Fiske, Media Matters: Everyday Culture and Political Change (Minneapolis: University of Minneota Press, 1994), 191-216. 105 Alan Cantwell, AIDS, the Mystery and the Solution (Los Angeles: Aries Rising Press, 1984); Alan Cantwell, AIDS and the Doctors of Death: An Inquiry into the Origin of the AIDS Epidemic (Los Angeles: 300 Best, promoted the theory that immunizations, in cluding the hepatitis B shot, were part of a comprehensive government bio-warfare pl ot to eliminate both blacks and gays.106 Initially, such theories were generally re legated to minor presses and the pages of Paranoia magazine and the like. But by the ea rly 1990s, one theory linking HIV to vaccines\u2014specifically, the polio vaccine\u2014gain ed credence and visibility. Outlets as diverse as Redbook , Rolling Stone , and the Lancet published theories that traced the genetic material in human immunodeficiency virus to live polio vaccine contaminated with monkey, or simian, viruses.107 Live polio vaccines had in fact long been cultured in kidney tissue taken from African green monke ys, and as early as the 1950s, government scientists and Merck researchers had documen ted their contamination with one simian virus, SV-40, that was shown to cause cancer in lab animals.108 In one hypothesis linking vaccines to HIV, AIDS got its start when poliovirus co ntaminated with simian immunodeficiency virus, or SIV, was admi nistered to gay men to treat recurrent herpes.109 Another hypothesis proposed that the virus had been seeded in African populations through global polio vaccination campaigns using contaminated vaccines.110 Aries Rising Press, 1988); Alan Cantwell, Queer Blood: The Secret AIDS Genocide Plot (Los Angeles: Aries Rising Press, 1993). 106 Felder's self-published boo k is described in Fiske, Media Matters: Everyday Culture and Political Change , 203-205. 107 Tom Curtis, \"The Origin of AIDS,\" Rolling Stone , March 19, 1992, 54-59, 61, 106, 108; Walter Kyle, \"Simian Retroviruses, Poliovacci ne, and Origin of AIDS,\" The Lancet 339, no. 8793 (1992): 600-601; Peter New and Sewell, Networks of Innovation: Vacc ine Development Merck, Sharp & Dohme and Mulford, 1895-1995 , 80-83. 109 Kyle, \"Simian Retroviruses, vaccine, and Origin of AIDS.\" 110 See \"Blackstream Knowledge\" in Fiske, Media Matters: Everyday Culture and Political Change . 301 In late 1995, the National Vaccine In formation Center (which by now had completely dropped DPT from its name) id entified a body of scientific work that appeared to unify the pervasive but still diffu se suspicions about the relationship between vaccines and unexplained diseases, includ ing autism and HIV. That year, NVIC published a special, urgent report on the work of University of South California scientist W. John Martin, who for several years had b een publishing papers on a \"stealth virus\" cultured from people with autoimmune and neurological disorders, including chronic fatigue syndrome, lupus, seizures, brain dama ge, and autism. His most recent scientific reports had identified the stealth virus (so cal led because, like HIV, it hid itself from the body's defense mechanisms) as a genetic relati ve of viruses found in the very African green monkey used to make polio and other live virus vaccines. Because they were so hard to identify, vaccine-introduced stealth vi ruses seemed, to vaccine skeptics, a perfect explanation for the otherwise bewildering sp read of little understood conditions, such as autism.111 NVIC threw their support behind Martin, informing members that his funding was running out and urging them to make imme diate donations for st ealth virus research; they also put out a call for members to get te sted for stealth viruses and become part of the database Martin was assembling at USC.112 NVIC's support for Martin's work (which was preliminary, and has yet to be replicated by other researcher s) is illustrative of the orga nization's scientific strategy. From its early years as DPT, NVIC had an ongoing tradition of working with 111 W. John Martin, \"Stealth Virus Isolated from an Autistic Child,\" Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders 25, no. 2 (1995): 223-224. 112 Barbara Loe Fisher, \"Discovery of an Atypical Virus Infecting Humans Linked to Viral Vaccines Produced on Monkey Tissues,\" The Vaccine Reaction 1, no. 4 (1995): 1-6. 302 \"establishment\" doctors and scientists, incl uding the American Academy of Pediatrics and biologists and immunologist s at major research universities. While they maintained this tradition of reaching out to establishment professionals, they also began to develop a pattern of finding scientists whose work was so theoretical or unusual or unique within mainstream science and medicine that they found themselves treated like vaccine-injured people themselves, that is, like David agains t the oppressive and di sbelieving Goliath of drug companies, organized medicine, fellow scientists, and the federal government. This is how NVIC treated Martin, w ho was asked to leave USC following allegations of fraud.113 It is also how they came to treat British gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield, whose 1998 paper in The Lancet , reporting a link between MMR vaccine, gastrointestinal disorders, and autism, wa s condemned by CDC staff and members of the American Academy of Pediatricians. NVIC r eceived all such scien tific reports with equanimity (as described in Chapter 5, DP T's founding members ha d been arguing a link between vaccines and neurological conditions, including autism, for close to 15 years) as well as a renewed sense of purpose. When Wa kefield came under attack by the scientific community, Barbara Loe Fisher, who was by now the president of NVIC, railed against scientists and policymakers for criticizing his work. \"It is tragic that vaccine policymakers in the government and the pr ivate sector would prematurely condemn independent clinical and basic science research which could lead to the identification of children perhaps genetically or otherwise at high risk of being injured by vaccines,\" she wrote. \"The kind of cutting edge research th at Dr. Wakefield has undertaken could lead 113 Martin went on to found an inde pendent research facility and in th e 2000s became a voice of hope for parents of autistic children. 303 to screening techniques and th erapies for these children. We need more science and less stonewalling.\"114 Vaccine skeptics were in fact just about to get more science, if not on the precise vaccines or hazards they had been keeping in their sights. In the year leading up to the end of the millennium, a series of events brought vaccine safety and the federal vaccine approval process under direct scrutiny by the public. In late August of 1998, Wyeth Laboratories' new RotaShield vaccine against rotavirus, a diarrheal disease, was licensed for use in infants. Six months later, in March of 1999, the ACIP recommended that the three-dose vaccine be given to all infants at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. But CDC scientists monitoring the national Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which had been established as part of the 1986 National Child hood Vaccine Injury Act, soon noticed an unusually high number of cases of intussus ceptions, a painful and potentially fatal bowel obstruction, in children who had received the vaccine.115 In July of 1999, the finding made for damning headlines and evening news stories.116 Wyeth stopped making the vaccine and the CDC recommended that pa rents and pediatricians stop giving it to 114 AUTISM AND INTESTINAL DISORDERS PARE NT GROUPS AND VACCINE POLICYMAKERS CLASH OVER RESEARCH INTO VACCI NES, National Vaccine Information Center Press Release, March 3, 1998, Available at http ://www.nvic.org/vaccines- and-diseases/Autism/researchvaccine.aspx, accessed March 2011. Contrary to contemporary popular understanding of the significance of Wakefield's 1998 paper, the publication was not the cause of lay vaccine worries but rather a product of them. By the time his Lancet paper was published, many vaccine skeptics were already convinced of a link between vaccines, including MMR, and autism, and were simp ly looking for \"establishment\" generated proof. Wakefield's work served this purpose; that his work was treated dismissively by his scientific peers made him a hero to many parents searching for an explan ation of their children's autism in the early 2000s. 115 Centers for Disease Control, \"Intussusception among Recipients of Rotavirus Vaccine--United States, 1998-1999,\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 48, no. 27 (1999): 577-581. 116 Lawrence Altman, \"U.S. In a Push to Bar Vaccine Given to Infants,\" New York Times , July 16, 1999, A1; \"Rotavirus Vaccine Pulled after Illnesses,\" The Gainesville Sun , July 18, 1999, 4G; \"Doctors Stop Giving Vaccine after Warning,\" The Virginian-Pilot , July 17, 1999, C5; \"U.S. Recommends Suspension of a Wyeth Vaccine,\" The Philadelphia Inquirer , July 16, 1999, C1. 304 children. When the ACIP met and reviewed the da ta in October of that year, they issued what the New York Times called \"a rare and embarrassing re versal\": they withdrew their earlier recommendation that all infant s be immunized against rotavirus.117 Further chagrin for vaccine scientists came later that same year, with the publication of The River by British journalist Edward Hooper.118 Hooper's massive work revived and painstakingly buttressed the theo ry that AIDS had been caused by polio vaccine trials. His analysis st rongly suggested that an experi mental oral polio vaccine, developed using chimpanzee tissue, transmitte d HIV's simian precursor virus to humans when it was tested in the late 1950s on populations in Burundi, Rwanda, and Congo; Congo was in fact home to the earliest documented HIV infection, in 1959. The hypothesis triggered a firestorm of debate in the scientific community but also drew lay attention to the very real po ssibility that vaccines could spread foreign viruses with unknown consequences. Hooper's book reminded readers of the contamination of early polio vaccines with SV40, as did many of his reviewers. Reviewers' and comme ntators' thoughts on Hooper's work were undoubtedly as influentia l as the book itself, as few lay observers consumed the 1,000-page, exhaustively footnoted tome. \"It could be the biggest \"Oops!\" in history,\" wrote a re viewer in the Toledo Blade .119 The New York Times called the book an \"embarrassment\" for scientists, since it reve aled \"that leading re searchers kept sloppy 117 Centers for Disease Contro l, \"Withdrawal of Rotavirus Vaccine Recommendation,\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 48, no. 43 (1999): 1007; Lawrence Altm an, \"In Turnabout, Federal Panel Votes against a Vaccine,\" New York Times , October 23, 1999, A11. 118 Edward Hooper, The River: A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS (Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 1999). 119 Michael Woods, \"How HIV Started Is Debated,\" The Blade , December 13, 1999, 32. 305 records and that prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals published reports that omitted crucial details.\"120 The book's reception by the scient ific community was just as significant. Even experts skeptical of its hypothe sis praised the work in such scientifically revered publications as Science and Nature , and the culprit vaccine's developer, the Philadelphia-based Wistar Instit ute, invited independent labs to test remaining stores of the vaccine to see if it did indeed contain chimp virus. (It did not\u2014but this finding did not conclusively disprove Hooper's theory).121 The book's overall reception gave further credence to the notion that vaccines were not just fallible in minor, insignificant ways, but could very well be implicated in the na tion's most troubling epidemics in decades. In 1999, the reception of Hooper's hypothesi s was just one more tremor shaking the foundation on which public confidence in vaccines stood. As pe diatricians trashed their stocks of rotavirus vaccine and parent s rescheduled appointments, the ACIP and the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2014which were now issuing coordinated immunization guidelines\u2014released yet another revision of the recommended vaccine schedule for children: children should now get four po lio vaccine injections, instead of the two injections and two oral immunizatio ns they previously received.122 The reason: although oral polio vaccine was more protective, the vaccine ha d been the sole cause of poliomyelitis cases (144 of them) in the U. S. since 1979. Given the progress of global 120 Lawrence Altman, \"New Book Challe nges Theories of AIDS Origins,\" New York Times , November 30, 1999, F1. 121 Robin Weiss, \"Is AIDS Man-Made?,\" Science 286, no. 5443 (1999): 1303; John P.

On the results of the independent testing, see Rebecca Voelker, \"The World in Medicine: No Chimp DNA in Vaccine,\" Journal of the American Medical Association 284, no. 14 (2000): 1777. 122 The CDC's ACIP and the AAP had recently begun coordinating their vaccination recommendations; previously, the AAP had issued its own recommendations distinct from those of the ACIP. 306 campaigns to eradicate polio beyond the U.S.'s borders, the ACIP concluded that the more effective but more risky vaccine was no longer needed.123 NVIC and other vaccine critics saw the re vised policy as an admission of what they had long claimed were the often-deni ed dangers of vaccines. They received the announcement that vaccine manufacturers s hould abandon use of the mercury-based preservative thimerosal (described in the pr evious chapter) with si milar satisfaction. Late in 1999, the editors of Mothering noted that the year had be en marked by a \"flurry of activity regarding the safety, ethics and po litics of vaccines\"; th eir bulleted list of developments on the vaccine front included the withdrawal of RotaShield, the FDA's thimerosal announcement, the replacement of oral polio vaccine with injected polio vaccine, and the CDC's suspension of hepatit is B injections for low-risk infants.124 The last point was a bit of an overstatement; the suspension, which was based on the presence of thimerosal in hepatitis B vaccine, was te mporary and the agency actually advised that infants whose mothers did not carry the hepa titis B virus be vaccinated at six months instead of right after birth.125 But the hepatitis B vaccine did come under broader scrutiny in the spring and summer of 1999, thanks to House subcommittee hearings chaired by Florida Representative John Mica. The hearings were called to address charges that a vaccine now required for nearly all children had been implicated in cases of multiple 123 Committee on Infectious Diseases, \"Prevention of Poliomyelitis: Recommendations for Use of Only Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine for Routine Immunization,\" Pediatrics 104, \"Revised Recommendations for Ro utine Poliomyelitis Vaccination,\" Journal the American Medical Association 282, no. 6 (1999): 522; Centers for Disease Control, \"Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices: Revised Recomm endations for Routine Po liomyelitis Vaccination,\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 48, no. 27 (1999): 590. 124 \"Vaccine Roulette: Weighing the Odds,\" Mothering , November/December, 1999, 30. 125 Public Health Service and American Academy of Pediatrics, \"Notice to R eaders: Thimerosal in Vaccines - a Joint Statement of the American Academ y of Pediatrics and the Public Health Service.\" 307 sclerosis and other neurological and autoimmune disorders. Th e testimonies shared at the hearings demonstrated how dramatically the hepatitis B virus and its vaccine had been reframed by the nation's shifting social and cultural concerns over the course of the 1990s. \"Helping or Hurting Public Health?\" On the morning of the hearings in Ma y 1999, Representative Mica informed those in the chamber that they were assembled to answer four questions: Did the benefits of hepatitis B vaccine outweigh its risks? Were its hazards adequately disclosed to parents? Were the adverse reactions it caused being adequately studi ed? And what conflicts of interest existed when CDC considered how and whether to recommend a vaccine? In the testimony that followed, proponents of the vaccine emphasized the seriousness of hepatitis B infection, its tendency to cause untraceable infecti ons, and the everyday challenges faced by those living with the vi rus in their bloodstream. People who spoke out against the vaccine\u2014primarily people who had been injured themselves, or whose children had been injured following vaccinatio n\u2014emphasized the low infection risk of most infants, the greed of drug companies, a nd the dismissal they faced from doctors and other health professionals. When witnesses fo r each side made reference to hepatitis B itself, they seemed to be discussing two diffe rent diseases. To officials from the CDC and members of the American Liver Foundation and Hepatitis Foundati on, hepatitis B was a lethal disease that infected 1 in 20 Amer icans and caused 5,000 deaths each year, many of these from liver cancer. To members of Massachusetts Citi zens for Vaccination Choice and Parents Requesting Open Vaccinati on Education, and to the doctors and 308 parents who had witnessed b lindness, deafness, seizures, and other effects following vaccination, hepatitis B was instead a rare, sexua lly transmitted infection that threatened drug addicts and foreigners, and posed no ri sk to American infants from healthy families.126 Two decades of varied representations of the disease piled up in the House chamber, a potent illustration of how value-driven perceptions of the disease and its vaccine were destined to make objective answ ers to Mica's questions an impossibility. By the date of the hearings, 42 states ha d adopted laws or re gulations requiring the vaccine for school or day care, and thous ands of side effects following vaccination had been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System. Mica noted that he had called the hearings in pa rt because of a New Hampshir e report indicating that the state had 3 cases of hepatitis B and 48 advers e reactions to the vaccine in children under ten. At his request, FDA statis tician Dr. Susan Ellenberg testified that in the entire country in 1997, 95 children under two years of age contracted hepatitis B and 43 had died following hepatitis B vaccination. But \"the problems are all in the interpretation\" of those numbers, said Ellenberg, because the reporting system cast a very wide net. Since anyone could report a reaction or death as be ing probably caused by a recently received vaccine, none of the reactions or deaths were definitively attributable to vaccines until investigated\u2014and in the case of hepatitis B vaccine, that hadn't happened yet. CDC scientist Harold Margolis assured Mica th at the agency was conducting several ongoing studies. But to Mica, all of th e present evidence added up to the fact that when parents 126 Committee on Government Reform, Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human Resources, Hepatitis B Vaccine: Helping or Hurting Public Health? , 106th Congress, 1st session, May 18, 1999, 7-31, 280-284. 309 were asked to vaccinate their babies against hepatitis B, they did so with insufficient\u2014 indeed, nonexistent\u2014knowledge of th e true risks of the vaccine. That the perceived danger of the vaccin e had begun to overshadow the perceived danger of the disease speaks in large part to changing attitudes toward HIV and hepatitis B's relationship to the disease. In the 1980s and into the early nineties, AIDS was a horrific and unmanageable specter, and hopes for an AIDS vaccine were projected onto the hepatitis B vaccine, which came to stand for the promise of triumph over insidious blood-borne infections. But by the late 1990s, the spread of AIDS had begun to come under control in the U.S., tha nks to campaigns that urged the use of condoms and the effectiveness and availability of antiretrov iral drugs. The manageability of AIDS tipped the balance\u2014slightly, but percep tibly\u2014between fears of the disease itself and fears of the vaccine or vaccines that may have caused both AIDS and the rest of the nation's autoimmune diseases. With AIDS under relati ve control, and with the push for broader hepatitis B immunization requirements, compar isons between the two diseases were no longer convenient for health officials w ho increasingly emphasized the fact that anyone\u2014not just drug users and promiscuous i ndividuals\u2014was at risk of hepatitis B. Indeed, in the course of the hearings, only one fleeting mention of the disease's comparability to HIV was made. At the same time, parents of vaccine injured children continued to quote from CDC publications stating that the di sease was sexually transmitted, asserting that it was, as Lyla Rose Belkin's father put it, an infection of \"junkies, gays, and promiscuous homosexuals.\"127 127 Ibid., 67. 310 The emphasis on defining the precise natu re and probability of the hazards posed by the hepatitis B vaccine also speaks to the skyrocketing emotional value of children in the very last decades of the twentieth cen tury. Historians Paula Fass and Mary Ann Mason have argued that this emotional value began to soar in direct response to the breakdown of marriage in the same period : as divorce and non-traditional living arrangements became increasingly common, th e bond between parent and child came to exceed the bond between spouses in emotional importance. 128 Spouses, that is, came and went, but children provided a source of emotiona l gratification that wa s supposed to last a lifetime. This attitude was evident in the testimony of Ma rilyn Kirschner, the single mother whose teenage daughter had became in capacitated by seizures, migraines, nausea, and fatigue that grew worse after each of he r three hepatitis shots. \"This vaccine has ripped out a part of our lives that can't be replaced,\" she said. The parents whose children suffered from hepatitis B itself felt similarly, as Thelma Thiel, chair of the Hepatitis Foundation International, revealed when she spoke of the loss of her \"precious\" four- year-old son to cirrhosis. This commonali ty between parents on opposing sides of the issue was well articulated by Barbara Loe Fisher of the NVIC, who testified in favor of more robust vaccine safety testing: \"...whethe r death or disability is caused by a disease or a vaccine, the pain is the same...we are a ll here because we love our children and we want to protect them from harm. ...we [need to] embrace the principle that every child's life is important and no child's life is expendable.\"129 128 \"Introduction\" in Paula S. Fass and Mary Ann Mason, Childhood in America (New York: New York University Press, 2000). 129 Hepatitis B Vaccine: Helping or Hurting Public Health? , 258. 311 To parents on both sides of the hepatitis B debate, statistical figures concerning the risk of disease or vaccine injury were meaningless when faced with the lived reality of caring for an irreversibly damaged chil d. For all the commonalities faced by parents living with sick or disabled ch ildren, the origins of their plights led to slightly divergent but ideologically similar attitudes toward st ate involvement in family health matters. Parents of hepatitis B positive children spoke of the stigma of the disease, the constant fear that their child would pass the infection to others, and th eir deep desire that parents in their communities would comply with state rules and have their own children immunized. Parents whose children became ill after vaccination, however, saw in those very same rules a state acting in the interest of itself and its cor porate supporters with little regard for the welfare of individual ch ildren and their families. But that didn't always mean that they wanted less stat e involvement\u2014like the parents of children infected with hepatitis B, they often wanted more: more oversight, more care, more attention paid to their concerns. Said one mo ther of a vaccine injured daughter: \"Lindsay, nor anyone [sic], should have to suffer like th is because scientific studies weren't done to determine if the vaccine was safe to give to every child. My daught er shouldn't have to suffer like this because government official s and drug company execu tives didn't do their jobs.\" 130 In the hearings, scientists and lay citizen s were given equal time and attention by the assembled lawmakers. That lay and scien tific testimony were equivalently valued on Capitol Hill that day is just one illustration of the degree to which scientific authority had been eroded over the previous quarter centur y. This erosion had been accomplished in 130 Hepatitis B Vaccine: Helping or Hurting Public Health? , 94. 312 large part through the social movements that had first got ten underway in the 1960s and 1970s, and whose influence on the opinions of vaccine critics was yet discernible in 1999. The emphasis that Mica and vaccine-injured witnesses placed on the uncertainty of the vaccine's long-term safety and protecti on were made possible by the now-entrenched risk-oriented rhetoric of the environmental movement. The predominantly female patients who recounted their struggles to get male doctors to believ e that their symptoms were real and vaccine-related recalled the an ti-hegemonic discourse of the women's movement. And the influence of the consumer movement was evident in the pervasive distrust of both government and industry sc ientists on display. One reportedly vaccine- injured woman, a public health nurse from I ndiana who asserted that she was not anti- vaccine, testified that she was troubled to le arn that Merck scientists had attended CDC meetings held to assess vaccine safety. \"[How] can an employee of a pharmaceutical company that manufactures the vaccine be ob jective in designing experiments to show fault in a product that generates close to $1 billion in sales for his company?\" she asked.131 The accusation was voiced again and again in the debate over hepatitis B vaccine, for by the late 1990s, the newly vacci ne worried and longtime vaccine skeptics alike perceived an abuse of power and viol ation of trust on the part of government officials engaged in the pursu it of public health. Conclusion In the immediate aftermath of the hearings, health officials voiced concern that \"antivaccine groups\" were gaining ground, gettin g the media interested, spreading word 131 Ibid., 112. 313 of vaccine risks on the internet, and \"gaining the ears of state and federal legislatures.\"132 One specific fear was that such groups would successfully repeal hepatitis B requirements in the states where they existed\u2014a logical response to the crisis of faith that seemed to be growing ever more deeply entrenched. But nothing of the sort happened. When New Jersey attempted to mandate the hepatitis B vaccine for its schoolchildren later in 1999, legislators, in response to parental concerns, wrote in a personal exemption to the requirement. (New Jersey allowed only religious exemptions for all other vaccines.) Nervous state health officials, fearing an unenforceable mandate from the legislature, then decided to write and adopt their own rule while state lawmakers were in rece ss. The move infuriated vaccine-worried parents.133 \"Even if there is only a slim chance that my perfectly healthy infant might die from a Hepatitis B injection, the fact that we are talking about chances at all is appalling. Since when did the New Jersey State Health Department legitimize gambling with lives?\" asked New Jersey mother Laura Maschal.134 But despite parental worries and the legislative \"skirmish,\" New Jersey's hepati tis B requirement went uneventfully into effect. By 2001, the vaccine was required of al l elementary and middle school children in the state. Maschal's opinion and the venue in which it appeared (the New York Times ) were testament to the fact that th e hepatitis B vaccine had helped bring debate about the risks of vaccines and government's power and ability to manage them fully into the public 132 Charles Marwick and Mike Mitka, \"Debat e Revived on Hepatitis B Vaccine Value,\" Journal of the American Medical Association 282, no. 1 (1999): 15-17. 133 Lisa Suhay, \"A Skirmish over the Hepatitis B Vaccination,\" New York Times , July 18, 1999, NJ1. 134 Laura Maschal, \"Deba ting Hepatitis B Vaccine,\" New York Times , July 25, 1999, NJ13. 314 arena. But even as this debate contin ued and grew\u2014as it would in the 2000s\u2014most Americans seemed willing to accept the state in the role of \"superparent,\" trusting it to determine the best policies for the welfare of their well children.135 By 2002, all but three states (Alabama, Montana, and South Dakota) had adopted laws or regulations requiring the vaccine for children in daycare, grade sc hool, or both. That year , 88% of the nation's children were vaccinated against hepatitis B. The figure climbed to 92% the following year, where it has held steady to this day. 136 Nonetheless, in the decade after the 1999 hearings, and in spite of the absence of any confirmation of the shot's suspected da ngers, the widely administered hepatitis B vaccine continued to signify the shortcomings of U.S. vaccination policy and practice for many vaccine skeptics. On World Autism Da y in 2009, actress and autism activist Jenny McCarthy and husband and comic actor Jim Carrey appeared on Larry King Live to talk about what they believed was the top f actor driving the nation's relentless autism epidemic: vaccines. In their hour on air, th ey railed against corrupt drug companies and complicit doctors, arguing that too many uns afe vaccines were being forced on children in the name of profit, causing new epidemics in misguided attempts to control overblown ones. For McCarthy and Carrey, one vaccine in particular captured for them all that was wrong with contemporary vaccination practice. \"The vaccine program is unbalanced,\" 135 Mason, \"The State as Superparent.\" 136 World Health Organization, \"WHO/UNICEF Estimat es of National Immunization Coverage: Estimated Coverage by Country, Year, and Vaccine.\" 315 said an impassioned Carey. \"It's a good thing that's gone too far... Do we really need hepatitis B on the second day of life?\"137 The subject of the relationship betw een autism and vaccines had reached mainstream airwaves in the early 2000s, wh en the confluence of events that brought criticism onto the hepatitis B vaccine paved the way for a much broader social critique of vaccines and vaccination policy. Although many of these critiques focused on the MMR vaccine\u2014whose purported risks had the imprimatur of a Lancet -published study behind them\u2014critiques of the hepatitis B vaccine had sustained traction. This was precisely because policies governing the vaccine had stretched the very definition of childhood vaccination beyond what some percei ved as an acceptable limit. The federal policy recommending the unive rsal vaccination of children against hepatitis B, and the historical moment of which it was born, represen ted the apex of the new era of vaccination heralded in the late 1960s. The state-level policies which subsequently required the vaccine for al l children were made possible by the consolidation of federal authority made mani fest in the Vaccines for Children program. These policies\u2014federal and state\u2014embraced the vaccination of infants, placing significant responsibilities of health citizenship on the s houlders of the nation's youngest possible members. This approach represented the most cost effective route to a healthy populace as well as the most convenient one; as one pediatrician put it, \"at least with infants you can capture them because you know you see them at birth.\"138 The 137 \"Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey Discuss Autism; Medical Experts Weigh In,\" in Larry King Live (CNN, 2009). Transcript available at http://tran scripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0904/03/lkl.01.html. 138 Elisabeth Rosenthal, \"Parents Face Questio ns on Vaccinating Infacts for Hepatitis B,\" New York Times , March 3, 1993, C12. 316 vaccination of all children, as opposed to thos e at highest risk of infection, was also determined to be more cost-effective than scr eening for those at high risk of hepatitis B. Moreover, this approach conformed to the principles of early, universal vaccination against childhood disease that had been worked out decades before, with the administration of vaccines against rubella a nd mumps to all children at an early age. Hepatitis B wasn't ever considered a childhood disease, but the presence of an effective vaccine made it possible for health official s and pediatricians to treat it like one. Furthermore, the professional entrenchment of pediatric care as a preventive specialty and the political attainability of public health care services for children made the vaccination of children the most expedient means of protecting the population at large against any disease. The realization of this era, defined by the federally advised universal vaccination of children against preventable infections, coincided with the arrival of broad-based criticism toward science and governmental authority generally, and toward vaccine scientists and policymakers specifically. The e ffects of this criticism would be felt, but not for several years: when state legislators attempted in 2006 to pass universal school mandates for another sexually tr ansmitted, oncogenic infection\u2014human papillomavirus\u2014their efforts would meet with public outrag e and legislative failure. Looking back, the laws mandating the vaccinati on of all children against hepatitis B had found a temporarily open window in the early to mid-1990s. 139 In the decade ahead, that window began to fall shut. 139 This conceptualization borrows from the concept of the \"policy window\" developed by political scientist John Kingdon. See John W. Kingdon, Agendas, Alternatives, and Public Policies (New York: Longman, 1995). 317 Conclusion In the current era of vaccination, unoffi cially heralded by the adoption of the Vaccination Assistance Act of 1962, the prot ection of the adult populace and future generations of Americans against the acute and far-ranging effects of severe and \"mild\" infections has rested in large part upon the shoulders\u2014or litera lly, in the arms\u2014of children. This era of vaccination, now roughly five decades old, was marked by several defining characteristics. In this period, federal authority in the area of vaccine recommendations became strong and widely recognized. Public acceptance of the mandatory universal vaccination of childre n became firmly established. And this acceptance was held in place by public awareness and acknowledgement of a health threat worth avoiding, in additi on to a patchwork of local la ws and regulations requiring vaccines for children attending daycare, grade school, and sometimes college. In some cases, the designation of a hea lth \"threat\" occurred upon the appearance of a vaccine itself. Neither mumps nor ch icken pox nor, in the 2000s, cervical cancer\u2014 discussed below\u2014were defined as public health priorities in and of themselves before their vaccines were licensed for use. But th ey were treated as su ch afterward. Vaccines brought attention to these diseas es and others, and in the pro cess refashioned the tools at hand for understanding the diseases and their ri sks. Sometimes, as in the case of measles and hepatitis B, the disease began to appear worse or more widespread than it had before, or it was framed as such in order to en courage vaccine uptake. In other instances, vaccines made diseases seem like an unn ecessary inconvenience to a productive and comfortable middle-class lifes tyle. This was the view cap tured in John F. Kennedy's 318 announcement of the Vaccination Assistance Act in 1962, and it was the view Merck tried to capitalize on when it advertised its mumps vaccine over a decade later. (The company adopted the slogan, \"To help avoid the discomfort, the inconvenience - and the possibility of complications: Mumpsvax.\"1) Kennedy's promise on announcement of the Vaccination Assistance Act was that Americans no longer had to suffer preventable infections; it was also that no American should have to suffer. In the period intr oduced with Kennedy's le gislation, vaccines promised to be great equalizers in a nation whose health care system has been fraught with dramatic inequalities in access to care and services. The federal vaccine programs of recent decades have strived to make vaccine s available to all children regardless of family means. Because they are demonstrably cost-effective (for the most part), easy to administer, and enforceable, vaccines and th e policies that govern them have come to comprise a not-insignificant portion of this country's universalized health care. The nation's vaccination enterprises have been astoundingly successful in this regard. In 2009, 95% of all child ren had received at least three doses of vaccine against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus; 93% were protected against polio ; 90% were protected against measles, mumps, and 90% ag ainst varicella, or chicken pox. Less than one percent of child ren\u2014in fact, just about one-half of one percent\u2014received no vaccines at all.2 1 Merck, \"The First Live Mumps Vaccine,\" British Medical Journal 2, no. 5910 (1974). 2 Centers for Disease Control, \"National, State, and Local Area Vaccination Coverage among Children Aged 19--35 Months --- United States, 2009,\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 59, no. 36 (2010): 1171-1177. 319 But while these overall coverage rates should have been adequate in most cases to establish herd immunity and keep the populati on free and clear of preventable infections, significant outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases continued to occur well into the 2000s. Some were attributed to communitie s with high concentrations of vaccine refusers.3 Others, such as outbreaks of mumps and pertussis in 2010, occurred despite high vaccination rates, prompting health officials to wonder whether vaccine-induced immunity was waning, whether pathogens we re evolving, or whether some genetic attribute left certain people still su sceptible to disease despite vaccination.4 The outbreaks were a reminder that the scientific and political promises made in the 1960s, of an era of freedom from infectious disease through vacci nation, was not just far from realization, but an impossibility. Disease eradication a nd even control through vaccination in recent decades have proved more complicated than our successes in combating polio (locally) and smallpox (globally) foreshadowed. As Rosenberg has pointed out, the biological reality of disease is inescapable.5 To a significant extent, health officials and the media blamed the persistence of vaccine-preventable infections in the 2000s on vaccine refusers, whose numbers 3 Saad Omer et al., \"Vaccine Refusal, Mandatory Immunization, and the Risks of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases,\" New England Journal of Medicine 360, no. 19 (2009): 1981-1988. 4 Tara Parker-Pope, \"Vaccination Surging-Wrong Use Other Version,\" New 20, 2010, D1; Anemona Hartcollis, \"Jewish Yo uths Are at Center of Outbreak of Mumps,\" New York Times , February 12, 2010, 2010; Jennie Lavine, Aaron King, and Ottar Bjornstad, \"Natural Immune Boosting in Pertussis Dynamics and the Po tential for Long-Term Vaccine Failure,\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Science 108, no. 17 (2011): 7259-7264. Outbreaks of measles and mumps that occurred in the 1980s, by contrast, were attributed to falling immunization rates due to federal and state budget cuts for vaccine programs, or to vaccines that proved less eff ective in practice than they had in vaccine trials. See Wharton et al., \"A Large Outbreak of Mumps in the Postvaccine Era.\" 5 Rosenberg, \"What Is Disease?.\" 320 increased in the early part of the twenty-f irst century. Their numbers were typically equated to the number of nonmedical vaccine exemptions parents filed to enroll their children in school. In one county in northeastern Washington state\u2014an admittedly egregious example\u2014close to 27% of childre n had nonmedical exemptions from vaccine requirements on record in 2009. 6 In the 2000s, this vaccine resistance movement was galvanized by growing numbers of autism activ ists, many of whom continue, to this day, to blame vaccines for increasing autism rates absent any definitive evidence.7 The heterogeneous movement also continued to draw members from the ranks of certain religious groups; small government proponents; social conservatives; parents demanding still more flexible vaccine policies and safe r vaccines; and individua ls whose selectively cautious approach to vaccines stemmed from personal experience or other sources of worry at a time when the list of required vacc ines for their children grew ever longer. But with the exceptions of notorious poc kets of vaccine resisters, across the country childhood vaccination rate s held strong in the 2000s, and this held true despite the increasingly visible and outspoken move ment critical of vaccines and vaccine policies. A few years into the twenty-first century, federal authority on the subject of recommended vaccine use was widely recognized. The recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practic es were widely followed, and they routinely served as the basis for state-level laws and recomm endations which, for the most part, parents 6 Omer et al., \"Vaccine Refusal, Mandatory Imm unization, and the Risks of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases.\" 7 Paul A. Offit, Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure (New York: Columbia University Press, 2008); Seth Mnookin, The Panic Virus: A True Story of Medicine, Science, and Fear (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2011). 321 adhered to for their children, even as protes ts from vaccine skeptics grew ever louder. These facts suggested to health officials, lawmakers, and pharmaceutical executives that a broad-based consensus had been reached on the vaccination of children. But the limits to this consensus were vividly illustrated in the debate that erup ted over the new vaccine Gardasil in 2006. Gardasil, a Merck vaccine ag ainst human papillomavirus (HPV), was the first vaccine to protect against an exclusively sexually transmitted infection. This alone helped make Gardasil and the proposed policies to govern its use contentious. But considered within the broade r context of half a century of vaccinating children, the national debate over Gardasil that took place between 2006 and 2008 was yet one more illustration of the historical contingency of vaccine reception. Gardasil's story contained many of the same elements of its late-twentieth-century predecessor vaccines, but its plot unfolded at an accelerated pace. The speed with which Gardasil was approved for market by the FDA, recommended for use by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and requ ired for school enrollment by proposed state bills reflected an assumption on the part of Merck, government officials, and state lawmakers: that the new era of vacci nation, marked by public acceptance of the mandatory universal vaccination of children, no matter the vaccine or the disease against which it protected, was firmly established. Bu t proposed laws to require HPV vaccination for sixth-grade girls drew l oud fire from a broad and diverse group of lay Americans, whose points of view were spread unpr ecedentedly far and wide through not just traditional media but the internet, which by this time provided a widely accessible and highly visible forum for the exchange of comments, opinions, and more. 322 Opposition to HPV vaccine mandates reflected long-held concerns about the proper role of the state in health matters, tensions over religious values, worries about risk, and changing ideas about authority and expertise. The debate bore the still-visible influence of feminist and environmentalist patterns of thought. It al so highlighted still- unresolved questions about who vaccines are for, when they should be administered, how their administration should be encouraged, and how encouragement, or enforcement, might be adjusted for vaccines that protect against diseases of varying severity. The debate, that is, revived some of the very questions raised by mumps vaccine four decades before, only this time a far more diverse set of voices chimed in w ith their opinions on the matter, thanks to the rise of new medi a and the increasingly democratic nature of media coverage of scientific issues. That th eir heated opinions were heard far and wide and acknowledged in statehouses across the c ountry, in fact, speaks to the historical moment in which Gardasil and pro posed mandates were introduced. For its first three years on the market, Gardasil was one of a kind; it was the first, and at that time only, vaccine to protect against several strains of HPV, a virus that causes genital warts and anogenital cance rs, including cervical cancer. 8 To bring the HPV vaccine to market, the FDA gave it a priority review at Merck's request.9 The ACIP, in apparent agreement with the FDA, also m oved quickly to issue a set of \"provisional 8 A second vaccine against HPV, Gl axoSmithKline's Cervarix, was approv ed for use in October 2009.

In September 2006, three months after Gardasil's approval, Michigan became the first state to consider a bill that would require all girl s to receive the HPV vaccine before entering sixth grade. A few months la ter, Texas governor Rick Perry issued an executive order mandating the same. Michigan's law didn't pass, and Perry's order caused a local outcry and was later overturned by his legislature. N onetheless, in 2007 anot her two dozen states considered bills to make HPV vaccination a requirement of girls to enroll in school.11 The bills prompted protest in every state in which they were introduced; ultimately just one state, Virginia, succeed ed in enacting an HPV vaccine mandate.12 But while the heated resistance effectively killed bills that would have required the vaccine for girls entering sixth grade, one quarter of all teenage girl s went ahead and got the shot voluntarily (or at a parent's urging) during Gardasil's first two years on the market.13 As 10 Centers for Disease Control, \"S TD Prevention Counseling Practices and Human Papillomavirus Opinions among Clinicians with Adolescent Patients --- United States, 2004,\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 55, no. 41 (2006): 1117-1120.

In this case, opposition to mandatory HPV vaccination reflected the belief that\u2014if health citizenship was conceive d as a combination of health-related rights and responsibilities\u2014protection against the infe ction should be a right of U.S. citizens, and not a mandated responsibility, or i ndeed a condition, of that citizenship. 14 To be sure, HPV mandates had strong s upporters as well. On both sides of the debate, participants brought their values to be ar on their characteri zations of the vaccine and its target infection. To reproductive health advocates , such as the Guttmacher Institute and Planned Parenthood, high rates of cervical cancer among Hispanic, African American, and Vietnamese women were a refl ection of social and economic injustices built into the health care system, which could be remedied with a federally subsidized, locally mandated vaccine. I ndeed, this was the very vision embodied in federal reforms from Kennedy's Vaccination Assistance Ac t to Carter's Childhood Immunization Initiative to Clinton's Vaccines for Child ren Program. But to groups on the religious right, including Focus on the Family and th e Family Research Council, HPV was first and foremost a sexually transmitted infection; administering the vaccine to every young girl in the country, they believed, was tantamount to condoning and even encouraging 14 A debate also followed the announcement that the Department of Homeland Security would require the shot for all immigrant women betw een the ages of 11 and 26, because immigration law required immigrants to get all immunization recommended by the ACIP. The requirement was ultimately abandoned. See Associated Press, \"Green Ca rd Applicants Mandated to Get HPV Vaccine,\" New York Daily News , October 3, 2008; Associated Press, \"Immigra nt Seekers Won't Have to Get HPV Vaccine,\" USA Today , November 16, 2009. 325 widespread premarital sex and promiscuity, a ch arge that had indeed been made about the hepatitis B vaccine a decade before.15 These were just a few of Gardasil's mean ings. To survivors of cervical cancer, the vaccine was, like the polio vaccine once was to polio survivors, the magic bullet they wished they'd had access to. To some v accine critics, like the National Vaccine Information Center, the hastily approved v accine was one more example of government and industry's inattention to safety. To some African Americans (Washington, D.C. lawmakers attempted to require the shot for the district's largely black public schools), the vaccine smacked of medical experimenta tion on black people and racist assumptions about black teens: \"After al l, your daughter is 11 and pr obably black...so the assumption is she'll be having unprotected sex in no time,\" grumbled a columnist for The Washington Post . 16 In drawing out these different opinions , the vaccine was effective in bringing attention to both HPV and cervical cancer, much the way vaccines against measles, mumps, and hepatitis B had helped bring adde d attention to those di seases in the past. This time, however, Merck's efforts in prom pting the public conversation about HPV and its vaccine were visibly overt. As a result, for all of the id eological differences among the many participants in the debate over Gardasil, most were united in pointing an accusatory finger at the drug company for rushing the vaccine to market, strong-arming government 15 Sue Blevins, \"Whose Life Is It Anyway?,\" Regulation 21, no. 55. 16 Courtland Milloy, \"District's HPV Pr oposal Tinged with Ugly Assumptions,\" The Washington Post , January 10, 2007, B1. 326 committee members and state legislators, us ing young girls as \"guine a pigs,\" and taking things, on the whole, \"too far.\" Merck's activities with re spect to Gardasil were unprecedented in some respects. Whereas Merck and other drug companies had adve rtised vaccines directly to health care providers in the past, this time, they marketed the shot and its target disease(s) directly to consumers on television and over the airw aves, taking advantage of a late 1990s regulatory change in pharmaceu tical marketing guidelines.17 Although HPV is the most common sexually transmitted in fection in the U.S., much like hepatitis B in the 1970s and early 1980s it wasn't widely feared. Th e majority of HPV infections don't cause symptoms and clear up on their own, and studi es conducted in the early 2000s revealed that most U.S. women had never heard of th e virus. Of those who had heard of it, only half knew it had some link to cervical cancer.18 Before Gardasil was approved, Merck ran an ad campaign featuring the catchphrase \"t ell someone,\" in which women informed each other of the link between HP V and cervical cancer. After Gardasil was approved, Merck marketed it as a cancer (not HPV) preventive directly to the would- be targets of state mandates. Its new ads featured independent young women (riding horses, on the soccer 17 FDA guidelines issued in 1997 permitted direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs through electronic media, including television for the first time.

At $360 for a se ries of three shots, Gardasil was the most expensive vaccine ever marketed. It also quickly became one of the most profitable, earning Merck $1.7 billion in its first full year on the market.20 The media scrutinized the company's activities, reporting on Texas governor Rick Perry's ties to a Merck lobbyist, the drug company's grants and speaking fees to doctors and patient organizations, and its financial support for Women in Government, an organization of female lawmakers that disseminated sample HPV legislation online and whose members introduced HPV related bills in state legislatures.21 Few venues declined to partic ipate in Merck's skewering.

Historian Judith Sealander has argued that the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis's campaigns of the 1950s overstated the risk of death and paralysis from polio infection. 23 In the 1970s, health officials amp lified the threat of mumps-induced complications to ensure the vaccination of a ll children (not just boys) against the disease. In the 1980s and 1990s, the sexually transmitted nature of hepatitis B was minimized in an effort to justify the widespread vacci nation of infants and youth. And the deliberate downplay of differentials of disease risk among subpopulations had been a recurring feature of vaccination programs a nd policies for the previous fi fty years. Indeed, seen in this light, the marketing and policy appro aches to the HPV vaccine\u2014including ACIP's recommendation of the vaccine for young girls and state lawmakers' efforts to mandate the same\u2014followed from the progression of vaccine encouragement efforts over the previous five decades. Merck's plan to market a disease and its risk factor in order to sell a drug was also not novel, but belonged rather, to a broader historical trend in pharmaceutical promotion 22 Sheila M. Rothman and David J. Rothman, \"Mar keting HPV Vaccine: Impli cations for Adolescent Health and Medical Professionalism,\" Journal of the American Medical Association 302, no. 7 (2009): 781- 786. 23 Judith Sealander, The Failed Century of the Child: Governing America's Young in the Twentieth Century (New York: Cambridge Univer sity Press, 2003), 334. 329 that developed over the last half of the twentieth century. From the 1950s through the 2000s, drug companies marketed\u2014to physicia ns and consumers\u2014conditions ranging from social phobia to erectile dysfunction a nd risk factors incl uding hypertension and high cholesterol, in order to sell thei r treatments as widely as possible.24 Merck's application of this tactic to cervical cancer fi ts within this familiar pattern. The marketing of cervical cancer risk to sell Gardasil al so has precedent in both corporate and state attempts to sell vaccines over the previous decades. It was a CDC officer who in 1970 urged his colleagues to work harder to make measles \"a more important disease to the medical and public mind.\"25 In the 1970s and 1980s, the marketing of the complications and prevalence of mumps, chicken pox, and hepatitis B was often accomplished more by health officials than by drug companies in an era when pharmaceutical advertising options were more restrained than they b ecame in the 2000s. In all of these instances, public purchase was dependent on a deliberatel y constructed awareness of the dangers of a disease the public once thought of as harmless, if they thought of it at all. In the case of Gardasil, Merck took an establis hed historical pattern and acc elerated it to the point of inverting it. The company began marketing ce rvical cancer prevalence and the risk of HPV infection before government health offici als themselves decided it was important to 24 See for example David Healy, The Antidepressant Era (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997); Jeremy Greene, Prescribing by Numbers: Drugs and the Definitions of Diseases (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007); Ray Moynihan and Alan Cassels, Selling Sickness: How the World's Biggest Pharmaceutical Companies Are Turning Us All into Patients (New York: Nation Books, 2005). 25 Letter to Dr. Frank Perkins.

The reception of every vaccine mandated for children over the past fifty years has been determined by socio-cultural context, and Gardasil proved no exception. Between 2006 and 2008, the two-year span in which Gardasil garnered ongoing media attention, popular responses to the vaccine and its prom otion were shaped by anti-corporate fervor, anti-pharmaceutical sentiment, growing vacci ne resistance, and related debates over vaccine access and safety. In the years just prior to Gardasil's introduction, the na tion had grappled with the sticky issue of vaccinating adults against percei ved bioterror threats. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the prospect of broad bioterror a ssaults on the U.S. prompted new calculations on the risks versus benefits of vaccines against smallpox and anthrax, and new conversations about w ho should get the vaccines, when compulsory measures were warranted, and how such decisions should be reached\u2014all of which yielded no easy answers. Even in the contex t of war, Americans were ambivalent about the vaccines and the policies suggested to govern them. When letters containing anthrax spores were sent through the mail to media offices and politicians in 2001, government aut horities grappled with whether to use the limited and inadequately tested anthrax vaccine to protect postal work ers and health care workers. 26 Almost immediately, some members of the public began demanding access to the vaccine for anyone who wanted it. At th e same time, some members of the military, 26 Christopher Snowbeck, \"On Terror/the Anthraxx Scare: No Anthrax Needed for Public, General Says,\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , October 10, 2001, A10; Arthur Allen, \"Who Should Get the Anthrax Vaccine?,\" Salon , November 2, 2001. 331 who were forced to take the vaccine, file d suit against the Department of Defense, ultimately winning an injunction against th e department's compulsory vaccination plans.27 The simultaneous threat of a bioterror a ttack drove the nation to begin testing and stockpiling smallpox vaccine. Again, when gove rnment officials announced that vaccine stocks would be reserved for health care work ers and other first-res ponders to an attack, some members of the public insisted upon access for themselves and their families.28 In turn, studies to test new batches of sma llpox vaccine were overrun with volunteers, prompting the New York Times to run a photo, from 1947, of millions of New Yorkers eagerly awaiting smallpox shots dur ing a post-World War II epidemic.29 But the nation's ambivalence was again on display when Presid ent George W. Bush announced that half a million military personnel and over 400,000 hea lth care workers would be vaccinated against smallpox. Most of those promised acce ss to the vaccine made it clear they didn't want it. Citing concerns about side effects, illness, and unanswered questions about how they would be compensated if the shot ma de them sick, most health care workers declined the offer.30 The post-September 11 vaccination disputes were a reminder that compulsory vaccination efforts have never been r eadily accepted in a nation founded upon the 27 Robert Pear, \"Judge Halts Military's Required Anthrax Shots,\" New York Times , December 23, 2003, A23. 28 Amy Argetsinger, \"Smallpox Vaccine Studies Swamped with Volunteers,\" Washington Post , 27, 2001, B1; Sheryl Gay Stolberg, \"A Nation Challenged: Immunization - Vast Uncertainty on Smallpox Vaccine,\" New York Times , October 19, 2001, B5. 29 Stolberg, \"A Nation Challenged: Immunization - Vast Uncertainty on Smallpox Vaccine.\" 30 Vicki Kemper and Rosie Mestel , \"Medical Groups Criticize Bush 's Smallpox Vaccine Plan,\" The Los Angeles Times , December 20, 2002, A32; Reuters, \"First U.S. Smallpox Shot R eactions Reported,\" CNN Health , February 27, 2003. 332 preservation of individual lib erties. (And nor have rationing efforts sat well in a nation founded on free enterprise.) Resistance to com pulsion often has as much to do with fears of harm as it does with adherence to ideologi cal principles, as it di d in the disagreements over vaccination against smallpox and anth rax. Notably, while some parents demanded access to the vaccines for their children, gove rnment policies in these cases targeted adults\u2014and adults, including the six military members who sued the Defense Department, made it clear that they preferred to take the vaccine on their own terms, after determining for themselves how the risk s weighed out against the benefits. The debate over Gardasil reflected this very ambivalence. Although compulsory proposals were rejected, many parents were willing to seek out the shots for their daughters on their own terms. But in this case , worries about how to accurately assess the benefits against the risks of vaccinating were complicated by a growing loss of trust in the pharmaceutical industry, which was part of a larger backlash against transnational corporations. The anti-globaliz ation movement of the early 2000s charged corporations with ignoring environmental, worker, and cons umer safety in their quest for ever-larger profits. 31 Merck seemed to exemplify the tre nd when, in 2004, its widely prescribed arthritis drug, Vioxx, was found to increase the ri sk of heart attack a nd stroke after five years on the market.32 The news about Vioxx also came on the tail of reports that hormone replacement therapy, used for decades to treat the symptoms of menopause in 31 On the rise of the anti-globalization movement, see Luke Martell, The Sociology of Globalization (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2010); Saskia Sassen, Cities in a World Economy , 3rd ed. (Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Pine Forge Press, 2006). 32 Terrance Neilan, \"Merck Pulls Vioxx Painkiller from Market, and Stock Plunges,\" New York Times , September 30, 2004; Marc Kaufman, \"Merck Found Liable in Vioxx Case,\" The Washington Post , August 20, 2005, A1. 333 women, also increased the risk of heart att acks, strokes, and certain types of cancer. These scares inflamed popular cynicism toward the profit-hungry pharmaceutical industry, whose ethical transg ressions were an increasingly popular theme in books, movies, and television dramas. Even the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine took on the industry in her 2004 book The Truth About the Drug Companies: How They Deceive Us and What To Do About It, one of a spate of much-discussed volumes on the same subject that began appearing in bookstore s and on talk shows in the early years of the decade .33 Compounding resistance to mandatory HPV vaccination was the fact that such proposals also came in the midst of a decad e in which vaccine skepticism had been steadily ramping up, attracting increasing publicity against a backdrop of skyrocketing autism rates. Autism affected 1 in 10,000 children in the late 1980s; by 2001, some studies estimated that autism affected as many as 1 in 500 children.34 Andrew Wakefield's 1998 study suggesti ng a link between autism and MMR became the impetus for new activist groups; added government reports, hearings, and studies; and a cacophony of testimonies, discussion boards, su pport groups, and othe r vaccine-skeptical discourse on the internet in the early 2000s.35 In due course, Wakefield himself became a 33 Marcia Angell, The Truth About the Drug Companies: How Th ey Deceive Us and What to Do About It , 1st ed.

So did actress Jenny McCarthy, who in 2006 took to the talk-show ci rcuit to describe her struggle to find causes and treatments for her son Evan's autism. In 2007, McCarthy released a book on the subject, Louder than Words , in which she detailed the research that led her to believe vaccines caused the immune-system damage that triggered Evan's autism.36 As lawmakers continued to debate mandatory HPV vaccines for girls, Louder than Words , with its plea for more cautious government vaccine policies, shot to the top of the nation's bestseller lists.37 McCarthy had no scientific training, and Wakefi eld was stripped of his medi cal license following charges of conflicts of interest and fabricated data. But both were important figures nonetheless for parents who were continuing to lose faith in the assurances of industry and government scientists. Wakefield and McCart hy were respected as unbiased outsiders and as parents, a source of expertise many vacci ne critics held more dear than years of academic training or experience in labs or government offices. For many vaccine- skeptical parents, Wakefield's own rejection by the scientific community confirmed that community's unbending intolerance of radical views. McCarthy, meanwhile, was proof of what the readers of Mothering and the authors of A Shot in the Dark had argued three decades before.

The prem ise reflected the messages of the consumer and women's health movements, increasin gly on display in popular debates over vaccines. Gardasil's socio-cultural context posed significant challenges for a drug company and health officials trying to frame ce rvical cancer and HPV as risks demanding immediate attention. Instead, v accine skeptics and other cynical members of the public highlighted every fissure they could identify in proposed mandates: the vaccine didn't address all causes of cervical cancer; it had been tested on women, not the young girls for whom it was being recommended; and, at any rate, \"what about the boys?\"38 Expressions of discomfort with this gendered approach to vaccinating highlighted one of the many larger, unresolved question that Gardasil and e fforts to mandate it also brought forth: who are vaccines for? Over the previous decades , the nation had engaged in vaccinating every member of the populace at ever-younger ages in order to \"catch\" citizens before they engaged in behaviors or activitie s that would put the health of their future, adult selves at risk. The interests of health officials, pediatricians, and parents aligned to make such policies possible. Though rubella posed the greatest risk to a pregnant woman's fetus, its vaccine was required for all girls and boys. Though mumps posed the most dreaded risk to post-pubertal males, it too was required for all children. Ditto for hepatitis B\u2014after 38 Ajantha Jayabarathan, \"What About the Boys?,\" Canadian Family Physician 54, no. 10 (2008): 1375.

Such policies, based on the principle of herd immunity, possessed a just and ethical logic. If everyone was vaccinated, everyone was safe, no matter their individual risk. But Merck marketed Gardasil to girls, and federal and state officials recommended it exclusively for the same. Furthermore, larg ely through Merck's marketing efforts, the vaccine was positioned as a drug for individual, not community, benefit.39 Marketing and legislative efforts targeting young girls therefor e embraced neither the altruistic principle of herd immunity nor the targeted vaccinat ion of highest-risk popul ations, and for these reasons seemed to confirm public suspicions that the mandates were blatantly about corporate profit.40 Indeed, in this respect proposed mandates did not follow inexorably from the progression of vaccine encouragemen t efforts over the previous five decades, which had emphasized the need for universal immunization with recommended vaccines in order to reach the epidemiological and econo mic goals of the state as a whole, and not its individual members. The state mandates proposed in 2007 and 2008 also revived a separate but related question health officials and medical profe ssionals themselves had asked back in the 1960s: what are vaccines for? As one mother put it, a disease that k illed less than 4,000 39 Robert Aronowitz, \"Gardasil: A Vaccine agains t Cancer and a Drug to Reduce Risk,\" in Three Shots at Prevention: The HPV Vaccine and the Po litics of Medicine's Simple Solutions , ed.

The appearance of such cynicism at this moment also spoke to the specific deterioration of trust in the nation's vaccine enterprise as a cooperative project of drug companies and government officials. For even physicians th emselves pointed out that medicine had a perfectly good cervical cancer preventive, bu t that, \"unfortunately, there is no lobby for the Pap smear.\"44 But such expressions of cynicism also highlighted the need for broader consensus on the question of what diseases s hould be prevented with vaccines, and how. For much of the two-hundred year history of vaccination, the endpoint of enforced immunization was protection from (and in th e mid-twentieth century, eradication of) 41 MaryAnna Clemons, \"So Why Does the State Want to Require HPV Vaccinations?,\" San Francisco Chronicle , March 12, 2007, 7. In truth, because the HPV strains against which Gardasil protects are linked to 70% of cervical cancer cases, mass immunization would have prevented a smaller number of cases, namely, just over 2,500. 42 Steve Lawrence, \"Vote Delayed on Bill Requi ring Girls to Be Vaccinated against HPV,\" San Francisco Chronicle , March 13, 2007. 43 Elizabeth Rosenthal, \"Drug Maker's Pu sh Leads to Cancer Vaccines' Rise,\" New York Times , August 20, 2008, 1. 44 Deborah Kamali, \"Requiring a Vaccine for Young Girls,\" New York Times , February 10, 2007, 14. 338 severe, epidemic diseases. The use of vaccine s against measles, mumps, and rubella in the 1960s and 1970s and chicken pox and hepa titis B in the 1980s and 1990s expanded the category of diseases against which mass vaccination was deployed, to encompass infections considered mild or of a circumsc ribed threat to the popul ation as a whole. But this expansion was neither immediate nor unquestioningly accepted, and in each case, it was driven by, and in many cases reliant upon, a unique convergence of political and economic goals, popular values, and socio-cultu ral concerns. In Gardasil's case in 2006 and 2007, these goals and values failed to ali gn in favor of a mandatory approach to vaccination. By targeting children, the floated HP V mandates did conform to longstanding expectations regarding the h ealth citizenship responsibili ties of youth in ensuring a healthy future populace. Pediatric care and school enrollment offered established means of implementing and enforcing vaccination re quirements. School attendance also offered an obvious means of spreading communicab le diseases through a community, and therefore an obvious justification for school-b ased vaccination laws. But because HPV is an exclusively sexually transmitted infection, proposed school entry laws lacked a transparent logic; they also evoked tensions historically common to debates over the proper role of the state in the manageme nt of sexually transmitted infections. 45 In terms of its likely communicabili ty in the school sett ing, HPV was little different from hepatitis B, but that virus's vaccine benefited from a tight link to AIDS and attendant cultural anxieties. The HPV vaccine also protected against cancer, but cancer-prevention was 45 See for example, Brandt, No Magic Bullet: A Social History of Venereal Disease in the United States since 1880 ; Porter and Porter, \"The Enforcement of Health: The British Debate.\" 339 (and is) neither an established component of pediatric care nor an accepted health responsibility of the nation's youngest citizens.46 The expanded health responsibilities of ch ild citizens, in the form of a lengthening list of required vaccines, were concomitant with children's growing rights as citizens in the last half of the twentieth century. 47 But prior to the 2000s, many of the health responsibilities of children we re laid on those too young or i ll-equipped to question them. In 2007 and 2008, by contrast, the rise of the in ternet and social me dia gave adolescent targets of vaccine mandates endless forums for their views on the matter. Within a year of Gardasil's approval, the websites MySpace, Facebook, and YouTube boasted thousands of groups, videos, blogs, profiles, postings, a nd forums related to Gardasil and the HPV vaccine. On MySpace and Facebook, teens aske d each other the same questions their parents and doctors grappled w ith: Is the vaccine sa fe? Is it necessary? And should it be mandated? While some adolescents used the sites to ur ge their peers to le arn the facts and get vaccinated, others\u2014both male and female\u2014decried HPV vaccine mandates as sexist, offensive, degrading, an imposition, unnecessary , and incompatible with their religious and moral views. Some pointed out the high pr ice of the vaccine and Merck's corner on the HPV vaccine market; others cited the Vi oxx scandal as evidence that Gardasil, too, 46 On the history of struggles to define blame for can cer prevalence in the U.S. population, see James T. Patterson, The Dread Disease: Cancer and Modern American Culture (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1987); Markowitz and Rosner, Deceit and Denial: The Deadly Politics of Industrial Pollution ; Robert Proctor, Cancer Wars: How Politics Shapes What We Know and Don't Know About Cancer (New York: BasicBooks, 1995); Devra Lee Davis, The Secret History of the War on Cancer (New York: BasicBooks, 2007). 47 Fass and Mason, Childhood in America , 5. 340 might someday be proven unsafe. Young women cited their own side effects as evidence of the vaccine's hazards and asserted their pe rsonal views on the balance of their rights and responsibilities as health citizens, saying, \"required vacci nation of gardasil shots is a violation of individual rights\" , \"we are not guinea pigs\", and \"its my body I ll make the decision for what goes in it [sic].\"48 On YouTube, female youth spoofed Merck's ads. One parody replaced the hip youth in Merc k's Gardasil commercial with a sullen housewife, a gang member, a stripper, a nd an underage drinker, subverting the implications of universal risk inherent not only in the ads, but in federal recommendations and proposed state laws as well.49 The commentary of female youth also signaled an inheritance of the very te nets of health feminism revealed in the vaccination disputes depicted in Mothering , Vaccine Roulette , and A Shot in the Dark a quarter century before. In a 2004 essay on contemporary anti-vac cination movements, Robert Johnston documented a shift in the vaccine debate in the 1980s, when skepticism about the claims of science increased on the parts of experts, and anti-vaccine groups increasingly adopted a pro-science posture. \"With significant chan ges on both sides of the vaccine debate,\" predicted Johnston, \"we are entering another historic era in which we may be witnessing 48 http://www.myspace.com, http://www.facebook.com.

For other clever wowTHATSfunny954, All accessed September 2008. 341 the birth of a new possibility, that of genuine dialogue\u2014and therefore of a truly democratic science.\"50 The debate over the HPV vaccine reflected this shift. Between 2006 and 2008, doctors and health experts ques tioned the HPV vaccine's limits and the wisdom of requiring the shot for all girls. Mothers of apparently vaccine-injured girls asked to work with \"appropriate professionals to find answers.\"51 What's more, the debate's outcome and its range of voices, fr om teenage girls to government officials, suggested arrival at a moment, if not an era, of \"truly democratic\" scientific decision making\u2014at least when it came to enforced vaccination.52 But the rejection of proposed HPV vaccine mandates was not an historic in evitability, as Johnston's prediction might suggest. Popular reaction to the vaccine a nd laws to require it were shaped by the historical moment in which they beca me visible to the broader public. The debates over HPV vaccination gave cr edence to a long-held, discriminating form of vaccine skepticism. For many of the parents, youth, and physicians who spoke out against proposed mandates in 2007 and 2008 were not opposed to vaccines generally, but rather to efforts to require that particular vaccine, at that particular moment. Their concerns\u2014Gardasil's forceful and rapid entry into the marketplace, its side effects, doubts about its necessity, and its exclusive use in girls\u2014had deep roots in popular vaccine skepticism simmering since the dawn of the new era of vaccination, in which vaccines against an ever-growing list of dis eases of varying severity were commonly 50 Johnston, \"Contemporary Anti- Vaccination Movements in Hist orical Perspective,\" 271. 51 Emily Tarsell, http://www .gardasilandunexplaineddeaths.com, accessed March 2009. 52 In 2008, even a member of the ACIP began to speak out against proposed mandates to require HPV vaccination for all girls. See Rosenthal, \"Drug Ma kers' Push Leads to Cancer Vaccines' Rise.\" 342 made requisite for all children. The public's reaction to HPV vaccine mandates also reflected the culmination of decades of growing circumspection with respect to government, industry, and indeed authority in general fost ered by the rhetoric and approaches of the social movements of th e last half of the twentieth century. The object of this cynicism was not just vaccines themselves, but the logic and the reasoning behind the policies gove rning their administration. Fo r even after four decades of mass, universal vaccination of children against a growi ng number of infections, the limits of this approach remained ill defined. As measures that require, in a country founded on personal freedoms, the infringement of personal liberty fo r the benefit of the commons, mandatory vaccination efforts will continue to be fraught with tension. Because the HPV vaccine protects against a sexually transmitted infection, efforts to require it for girls were co mplicated by compounded tensions about adolescent sexuality, which was the object of high profile ideo logical disputes in the early 2000s.53 But the Gardasil debates were neither simply a bout HPV's sexual transmission, nor Merck's heavy-handed promotion of the vaccine. Like other vaccines before it, Gardasil was framed by the cultural and political preoccupations of its time. Re lated policies spotlighted unr esolved questions about how vaccines against \"milder\" diseases of limite d communicability and debatable epidemic stature should be deployed. Neither the pub lic, nor scientists, nor policy makers, nor pharmaceutical companies had arrived at a si ngular, agreed-upon answer to the questions 53 See Chapter 8 in Alexandra M. Lord, Condom Nation: The U.S. Government's Sex Education Campaign from World War I to the Internet (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010); Kristin Luker, When Sex Goes to School: Warring Views on S ex--and Sex Education--since the Sixties (New York: W. W. Norton & Co., 2006). 343 of what and who vaccines are for, and w ho, ultimately, should determine the health citizenship responsibilities of the nation's youth. In the resulting void, the HPV vaccine became the latest object of a long-standing a nd increasingly urgent debate. After much heated back and forth, the nation settled on a set of compromises to answer these questions with respect to Gardasil. The vaccine, like the many that came before it, offered a cutting-edge preventive to a long-standing health threat fo r those who wished to avail themselves of it. But children, specifically gi rls, would not be forced to take it\u2014at least not at this point in time. It should come as no surprise, however, that when faced with our next new vaccine, the country may be forced to revisit the increasingly familiar set of questions raised by each new vaccine in troduced over the last half century.344 Bibliography Archival Sources The American Presidency Project, Univers ity of California, Santa Barbara (internet archive) Archives of the National Vaccine Info rmation Center (internet archive) Jimmy Carter Library and Museum, Atlanta, GA William J.
