But, a large number of plants are listed here. The name itself proclaimes that ' I am an Arishta of ten roots'. How it happened? Answer: Main ingredient of Dasmularisht is the group of ten herbs. but it also contains other ingredients that are mentioned above. Research Bio activity study was done on aqueous extract of Dasamoolarishtam. It exhibited no inhibition to the growth of PPR and Reo virus in vero cell line.( [1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7356936_Bioactivity_studies_of_the_individual_ingredients_of_the_Dashamularishta)) Anti-microbial Dashamularishta was Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, etc. Maximum efficacy of environmental pollution, Sudhanshu, Sandhya Mittal et al. Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Applied Sciences, JECRC University 2, Jaipur-22, Rajasthan, India, Published in international journal of pharmaceutical sciences and research Phytochemical screening has proved the presence of reducing sugars, Flavonoids, Tannin, saponins. Different Dashamoolarishtha. 2. Sushruta samhita-Chikitsa sthana 6th Chapter A variant of Dashamoolarishtha containing minimum number of ingredients like Dashamoola,Danti,Chitramoola and Hareetaki; the classical formulation does not contain musk it. 3. Dashamoolasava: Brihat nighantu ratnakara-Kshaya roga chikitsa Yogaratnakara though referred as Asava (Dashamoolasava) infact it is prepared by the same method of Arishtha(by boiling the drugs-decoction method).This formulation is also possessing musk. In addition, this has the seeds of [Dhattura (Datura metel)](https://easyayurveda.com/2014/07/01/dhattura-datura-metel/).So such formulations should be prescribed with utmost caution as some may be susceptible for allergic manifestations or adverse reactions. 2.*Vangasena-Grahachikitsa This is a simple recipe of Dashamoolasava and possesses less number of ingredients.In fact this has this formulation even though contains Chitraka like any other Dashamoolarishtha or Dashamoolasava formulations,amount of Chitraka is less in this recipe and hence mild in action. Among the above said references most commonly practiced one is the preparation referred in Sharngadhara samhita. Kasturi (musk) mixed Dashamoolarishtha or Dashamoolarishtha special etc are quoted in the formulations now a days most of the pharmaceutical companies do not add Kasturi(Musk). Even though few of the license holders who are rearing the musk deer sell the product directly to the ayurvedic pharmaceutical companies judging the genuineness will be very difficult for a common man. However a physician who practices the preparation in routine can identify the genuineness of the product my its smell, taste and action. Otherwise purchase of such formulations with 'heavy cost' may not be justifiable. Usually available Dashamoolarishtha do not possess Musk; inspite of that if all the ingredients are added good result can be expected. Dashamoolarishtha referred with Sootika roga are also available in market. As such no classical recipe is present with this name. Instead, these are modified praparations of Dashamoolarishtha. In such preparations additional Jeeraka or Ajamoda or both ares added while preparimng the product.Few of the firms add 50% Jeerakarishtha for the above specified Dashamoolarishtha and advertise it as Dashamoolarishtha-Sootikarogartha. In few south Indian states [Balantha khada ](https://www.ayurmedinfo.com/2016/09/26/baidyanath-balant-kadha-no-1-uses-ingredients-dose-side-effects/)(indicated in Sootika roga - post delivery care) is added to Dashamoolarishtha and it is prescribed as specific Dashamoolarishtha recommended for puerperal period.

Also the formulation is of utmost use in Vata -Kapha predominant seasons and individuals. In generalized body ache this is my drug of priority. Especially when the patients approach with the complaint of work exhaustion or body ache caused after heavy work this medicine alone is useful; in adults this can be given in the larger doses like 50-60 ml also, which will not cause any adverse reactions. But, are recommended to take the medicine with large amount of water.In severe muscular pain the condition can be managed by Dashamoolarishtha alone or along with Yogaraja guggulu or Navajeevana rasa etc. Lower abdomen pain, pain in the flanks and Low bach ache can be well managed with the combination of Goksuradi guggulu or Punarnavadi guggulu followed with Dashamoolarishtha. Neuro- muscular pain and abdominal distention are effectively treated by the combination of Mahadhanvantara vati followed with Dashamoolarishtha. But any Vishatinduka (nux vomica) containing formulation is to be administered along with this Arishtha it is always better to keep a gap of at least 10-15 minutes as in few cases warmth is complained by the patients and it is due to the heat generated due to the combination. However, if Kamadugha or Sootashekhara are associated this cannot be experienced by the patients. Vatavidhwamsa rasa in combination with Dashamoolarishtha is effective in joint pain conditions. Sitopaladi choorna followed with this arishtha helps to expel out the phlegm very well. Distention of abdomen and heaviness of the head or head ache felt immediately after the heavy food can be managed by Dashamoolarishtha followed by Dhanvantari vati. In association with Chitrakadi vati it reduces the complaint of abdominal bloating and loose stools. In pedal edema and pain in the lower limbs the formulations acts well along with Chandraprabha vati or Punarnava Dashmoolarishta special is a proprietary medicine manufactured by Baidyanath.
