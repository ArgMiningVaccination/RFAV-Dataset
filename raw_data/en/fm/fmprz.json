This is, of course a conclusion which fully simplifies the role of all the actors and functioning of the whole society, but gives the essen ce of expectations set in front of this system, those that have to be realized with the least po ssible financial investments. According to the rule, all the others unite, with no reserves, in failure criticizing, normally unreal expectations, without reconsideration of the role and responsibility that they have in reaching and functioning of \"safe society\" (meaning from local community to state) In order to better understand current state, we can use an example of a prison, in this case Penitentiary Ni. The contents of this pub lication are the Report on monitoring imprisonment conditions in Penitentiary Ni, in the period Ma y 2007 - May 2008 and selection of articles from international and national legisla tion related to the aspects that we followed. As a report model we used OSCE guide \"Monitoring on prisons and imprisonment institutions, practical guide for NGOs\" Problems that cannot be successfully solved by implementation of any law and that require different approach in solving are: - Understanding (of different penitentiary services, admission services that are yet to be included and widest community) that the prisoner is a person whose freedom of movement is restricted, as a penalty for comm itted crime, while he keeps right to enjoy all other rights. - That laws represent a list of what is not a llowed and that there is a large field of possibilities for work with the prisoners which do not have to be stated in laws for it is not forbidden and its implementation is not an offence. - Lack of affirmative approach; Here, we also want to draw attention to groups of prisoners that have to be additionally taken care of so that they could accomplish equality in the existing system. Those are: - Disabled persons; - Minorities (ethnic, national, religious, illiterate) - Poor One of the aims of our work is a contributi on to the reform of System for execution of prison sanctions, where, according to our opinion, a key role should be give n to re-socialization. Starting point is that education is a process of adopting socially preferable and acceptable 6attitudes as well as system of values. Treatment implies redefinition of adopted, inadequate attitudes and system of values as well as adoption of those missing ones. The change with prisoners that is possibl e to accomplish, during sentence serving, is adequate attitude towards the crime for which th ey are sentenced, which we can understand as a minimum of necessary change. Optimum to maximum would be insight in relevant causes that brought to the crime and establishment of new system of values that implies respect of both personal and other society members' values and rights, as well as adoption of the way so that this system can function. In the process of education and treatment, awar d and punishment play important role. It is necessary to emphasize that during education ev ery person adopts both system of values and the way in which this system is learned. That is why it is necessary to emphasize that education should be based on system of awards and an award could be anything, while the sanction/punishment could be withdrawal of the award. This approach qualitatively raises the level of the whole system of individual's pers onal values, which is a necessary precondition for the respect of others and it creates greater ca pacity for accepting positive changes- all these constitute re-socialization program. Qualitative differently set up re-socialization mu st be followed by adequate change in the organization of implementation system Results that would come from re-socializa tion program designed in this way would absolutely satisfy set-up goals concerned with pris on sanctions within Nationa l strategy of Justice System reform/ System for execution of prison sanctions, which is based on three main aims: - Safe-guarding of every prisoner and detain ee, in safe and secure way and in humane conditions, in line with international laws. - Promotion of other types of sanctions excep t institutional, for punishment and treatment of prisoners - Reduction in repeated offence rate after release. We believe that it is particularly important in Serbia that the results of reaching these goals are as good as possible. Serbian society is a post-conflict one, or maybe in people's heads lasting conflict society, which has not gone far in the process of transition from socialism to capitalism, which is being implemented chaotical ly, while the violence rate is dramatically increasing. Violence and crime exist everywhere in the world, but in comparison to developed countries, from the aspect of ordinary citizen, th ey are, conditionally speaking, predictable over there and the system can handle them (for example, there is a web page for Chicago where one can see, on the city map, the type of criminal in each street. It is regularly updated, which, for example, has an impact on the selection of the area where one wants to live). There is an impression that there are no safe places in Serbia, in sense suburbs-downtow n, village-town, and it is not possible to make any relation between the location and type of criminal. That is why it is important to cut the chain and establish control over violence and criminal. Prisons, according to our laic estimation, could be that place. That is why we think that reformation of prison system and planning, as well as implementation of efficien t re-socialization program are additionally in interest of widest community and that they should include all stakeholders, directly or indirectly related to the realization of \"safe society\". 7 Basic information on the project and its realization: Overall objectives: Prevention of torture and contribution to torture eradication.

The data we got is related to prisoners who are, in different ways, temporarily or permanently, not capable of working, for different medical reasons. At the same time, prisoners whose diagnostic procedure is in progress, due to possible disability, are neither recognized as persons freed from work nor as disabled persons. In th at sense they are not recognized as persons who need additional assistance and other pers on's care during diagnostic procedure. Since we don't know the number of disabled persons, we don't know the types of disability in a particular case, as well as needed individual assistance. Out of this it can be concluded that there is a system lack because disabled persons are not recognized as a category that requires special accommodation conditions, by which they would be brought to equal position w ith other prisoners, i.e. they would not be discriminated. - Number of prisoners freed from work for medical reasons 15 - Number of prisoners in the hospital on the day of the visit 24 Implementing and PR person Project coordinator : Lidija Vu kovi Project assistant : Milena eli 12History of Penitentiary in Ni. After Ni and its surroundings were liberated from Turks, a prison was built up in Ni, at the location of today's fortress. After Poarevac, Ni was the second town in Serbia to have a prison. Catacombs in the Fortress were used for the detention of prisoners. No methods, means or special tr eatments and reeducation were applied. The guards lived in the Fortress, warden and his deputy rarely got in touch with the prisoners. Each room in which the prisoners spent their time had a room master called \"dinarac\" It was a prisoner who took care of other prisoners' needs, discipline, hygiene, work and health and at the same time he was a mediator between the prisoners and the warden. As the time was passing, capacities of Ni Penitentiary became insufficient for the accommodation of all the pris oners. By the end of 19th century, new location for Ni Penitentiary was defined, today's location, in the area locat ed 4 kilometers from Ni suburbs. The construction of new penitentiary started in 1908. Central pa rt of First pavilion was built by 1910. During the escalation of First World War the Penitentiary was managed by a warden, infantry lieutenant colonel of Serbian army, Jaa he Nenadovi . Hi did something that was considered to be a great deed in the history of punitive policy- invited a ll the sentenced prisoners of this institution to \"stand up for the defense of their motherland that was in danger\". After the liberation, the prisoners were allowed to leave the prison, no ma tter the duration of the rest of the sentence. From 1915 till 1918 Penitentiary did not work as an institution, instead, it was used by Bulgarian occupants for the accommodation of so ldiers and horses. In the period from 1918 to 1941 Penitentiary institute expende d rapidly and its capacities were increased. Intensive building starts in 1920. Central part was added with a central wing in the period from 1922-1928, kitchen and bakery, with store houses in 1932, and sec ond pavilion was built in 1934. In 1930 a decision to finance a building with cells was brought by the Ministry for Civil Structure. Starting from 1941 the Penitentiary was managed by Germans who took over the prison, together with the prisoners. After the escape of the detainees from the Camp Crveni Krst (Red Cross), Germans shot 600 prisoners. 350 prisoners, sentenced by German rules remained in the Penitentiary. Rooms in the prison were used then by a special police for hearings and torturing. Sentenced prisoners in the Penitentiary institute were used as hostages for each killing of a German soldier. In October 1944 the Penitentiary remained em pty, abandoned and destroyed. Everything was broken in the rooms, the documentation was burnt down and rest of the prisoners grabbed their chance and escaped after the Germans had left. From 1949 we can follow the changes in the architecture of Penitentiary-Ni. Besides pavilions and \"white house\" there were: Main sup port building, Guards barrack (a ward where a restaurant and a kitchen were located), a buildi ng Governor's villa, cultu ral and educational house for the prisoners, industrial building- a fact ory, a metal workshop, waiting room used by prisoners' families, talking room, used for th e conversations between the prisoners and the visitors. Out of the Prison circle there was, so ca lled\" housing colony, with the flats for the officers in the prison, During 1951, a building fo r accommodation of railway guards, a facility for sow forth delivery , economy building, a shop and a store house of \"Deligrad\" factory were built. In 1954, the prisoners got the building which had been previously used for school. A part of the building for prisoners in open-type regime wa s reconstructed in 1956 and on the ground floor a laundry drier was built. Visit hall which served for visits to prisoners was built and equipped in 1969 and in 1970, a canteen with the kitchen was bu ilt and equipped. It started with its work in 1971.

Facilities in Penitentiary Outward and inward appearance (architectural, development stage, facilities, hygiene), of the penitentiary The whole penitentiary complex is surrounded by the 5 meter high safety wall. At the full length of the wall there is a barbed wire with 10 equally spaced posts. Renovation within the complex: During the su mmer in 2007, the sewage and water supply system were replaced within the whole penite ntiary complex. During the same period the dormitory \"B\" was also renovated. 1.1. Increased Supervision Department The building was built in 1934. Outward, it is in a very good condition. Inward, it is in a far worse state and the worst is in the basement where solitary confinement cells are located. The walls in the hallways and rooms haven't been painted for a long time and this is something that should be done immediatelly unl ess the whole building is to be renovated. The walls are partially oil strainer varnished and pain ted to the ceiling. At the moment, much of the oil strainer varnish is scaled off and cracked. Th e floors in the hallways are old, concrete lined without being panelled. On the firs t floor vinaz panelling is installed The room for the prisoners, the hygienists in the build ing, is spacious, ventilated and well taken care of; there are four beds, two tables, four chairs and the TV. Regarding the space, dormitories are hardly standardized for the residence of the prisoners. There are 17 rooms with 3 people (besi des one with 4) and another 10 rooms with 2 people that can be locked. There is a parquet floor. The beds are old, with the three metal bunk beds. The mattresses are seemingly in a much worse state than beds. The bedding is old. There is one locker for all three prisoners. At the moment there are 84 prisoners. At the moment there are 81 prisoners two of which are food conveyers, and two are responsible for keeping the common rooms clean. They are placed in the open cells. The sanitary system is in the room, the s quat toilet and the tap are separated from the room by a one meter high wall without any doors. In order to be, at least visually, separated from the sanitary system the plastic tube handles attach ed to the ceiling and meant for plastic drapes have been placed in 13 cells above the toilets. Th e plastic drapes seem like shower curtains. There is a drape only in one cell. In the rest of the 14 cells there are neither handles nor drapes. The pass water system is consisted of show er bath and a washing room. The floor in a pass water system is in a good condition, the shower-bath and the taps are functional and there is a new washing machine. There isn't any hot water in the cells. However, each cell gets a bucket of hot water in the evening if it is requested. The prisoners ta ke a shower once a week. The laundry is washed and dried in the cells so that there is much more damp. This is due to the fact that once purchased washing machine has been out of order and ther efore useless. In the b asement there aren't any shower rooms due to the improper electrical installa tion. In the basement, the shower system is not working. The hygiene is good. The cells for solitary confinement are in the basement . The cells were renovated a few months ago but they are in the same bad conditi on as they were before the renovation due to the high level of damp which is appa rent on all walls and the ceiling.In first part of the basement there are nine solitary confinement cells. The tw o are renovated, the third one being renovated. The oil strainer varnish is orange as well as the ba rs. In entirely 17 solitary confinements there are 38 prisoners who are not sentenced to the solita ry confinement according to the disciplinary measure but their status is the same as of the ot her prisoners placed in the cells upstairs being a part of the Increased Supervision Department. Th is is due to the overload capacity of the whole penitentiary. In this part there are 7 prisoners . Going down the long narrow hole there is a second 14part of the basement where another 6 solitary confinement cells are located. Two of them are bigger and designed for two people. (It is concl uded that the prisoner who is convicted to the solitary confinement cell shouldn't be alone). In th e three of the cells the floor is renovated, one half with teraco paneling and the other with the old sh ip floor. These are the cells for two people. There is central heating and it is very cozy during the winter, as the prisoners say. The ventilation is natural but the airing is not very good, though the guards tr y to make things better by opening the less accessible windows as well as small windows on the doors. There is enough daylight due to the good size of the windows. The artificial lighting is central, controlled from the outside. There are bars on the windows. The halls between cells are old but hygienica lly clean. There is not enough hygiene in the cells due to the fact that three prisoners spend 23-24 hours in a small space. 1.2. The Department \"C\" This is a closed type building. Outward, th e plaster fell off on certain parts of the wall, the lime is ruined, the waterspouts are partially ou t of order, the windows are old and with bars. The dormitory \"C\" is going to be renovated next year (2009) when financial resources are provided by a new budget Inside the building there is the ground floor and the two floors. In the stairway (teraco) there is treatment officers' room. This part is separated from the section where the prisoners are by bar-doors that can be closed. On each of the fl oors there is vinas paneling which is in a very bad condition. The walls in the hallways are up to 1.2 m oil strainer varn ished and painted up to the ceiling. These hallways are at the same time the space which the prisoners use for daily routines, although there is a smaller room for da ily activities with the TV on each floor. There are also closets, benches, chairs, tables. In the whole building there are 14 dormitories: 4 on the ground floor, 5 on the first and 5 on the secound floor, with 20 beds each. The beds are made of metal and two are bunk beds. There are bars on the windows. The ventilation is natural; the windows are r eachable and can be opened. There is a district heating system. There is enough daylight; there is a central el ectric lighting which is controlled from the outside. Hygiene: there aren't enough shower baths, sanitary systems, there is a harsh and unpleasant scent but the prisoners themselves pour wa ter into the sanitary system. There is an impression that the overall hygiene is not satisfactory. On the ground floor of the dormitory \"C\" the toilet boilers are out of order and there is sometimes hot water. On the first and the second floor of the dormitory \"C\" new functional toile t boilers have been placed. According to the statements of the prisoners themsel ves there is nonstop hot water. The impression is that the overall hygiene is on the considerable level. The House rules (being in a plastic foil) ar e displayed on the ground floor as well as the explanations of certain prisoners' rights and proce dures for achieving those rights. On the first and the second floor the House rules are not displayed but the procedures for achieving prisoners' rights are. On 05/05/2008 ,the visitation day, there we re 213 imprisoned. On the three floors there were no beds in bedrooms. The number of people in the bedrooms was from 9 to 18. 1.3. The Hospital (stationary) and the Ambulance 15Outward, it is an old building with a renovate d fa\u00e7ade. Inward, the walls are painted and in a good condition. A part of the hospital ward which has been renovated since the last year is adapted for the purpose of a lab which is moved from the upstairs of the hospital to the ground floor. The two wards for infectious and psychiatri c patients have been adapted as well. This new part is situated on the ground floor of the buildi ng. The inward walls are badly painted and quite scaled off. One part of the hospita l ward is being renovated. The ambulance is consisted of a number of rooms such as: card file, consulting-room, interventions - rooms for diagnostic, sterilization r ooms with autoclave, dentist and surgery which is not always in function. There is also a pharm acy and a lab. Medical instruments and equipment needed for sanitary service are part of th e ambulance segment in the ground floor. The instruments are of various date. The hospital is upstairs. The prisoners-patie nts are put away in the three rooms (two smaller and one big room). There are also the TV room, the dining room, the toilet and the bathroom. The walls and the floors are in the same cond ition on both of the storeys. The floors are vinas panelled and kept wet. On one part of th e walls there is vinas panelling or oil strainer varnish. They are painted up to the ceiling. Both walls and floors are partially damaged. Natural and artificial lighting are relatively good, the artif icial lighting inside of the rooms is controlled from the outside due to the regimen. The TV room is open till 1 am. There are benches, a table, chairs and the TV. In the hospital there are me tal beds with mattresses, the bedclothes and the blankets which are in a bad c ondition. Regarding the furniture, there are wooden tables, chairs and cabinets. Toilets and a bathroom: there are mo re faucets in the bathroom. The toilet is in function. The hygiene is satisfactory. There is central heating. The ventilation is natural and adequate. The bars are placed on all of the windows. Health Care Department in Penitentiary Ni is organized as an ambulance with out- patient aid station. All regular checkups are de fined by a weekly schedule for the pavilions; individual checkups of prisoners, as well as complete distributi on of parenteral and peroral therapy are carried out in the premises of centr al ambulance building, in doctor's office or interventions. Each checkup and medical-technical intervention, diagnostic and therapy, is promptly written in medical documentation- health care files, individually, for each prisoner and it was given to us for overview. . Dental service is well equipped with contem porary devices (for sterilization, tooth filling making and device for helium tooth fillings). The following services are provided to the prisoners: - Teeth healing with endodoncy, - Paradentology, - Oral surgical interventions (tooth extractions and minor surgical interventions) while, for some more complicated conditions, th e prisoners are sent to Dental Clinic, - Prothetics, mobile prothetics are made A dentist (specialist) is employed as well as an as sistant to the dentist, who can, should there be no adequate staff, perform the work of a dental technician. It is interesting that the device for helium tooth fillings was bought in 1985 when it was really rare in dental practice Dental service has a practice where they perform check-ups and interventions as well as special root for dental technique. There is a special dental Roentgen (x-ray) device. In the period January- September 2007 there were 1327 check-ups. Extremely professional and skilled approach to the medical staff to prisoners (patients) can be seen and we detected that during several check-ups that we saw, both in Dental care department as well as in other practices of Penitentiary Health Care Department. 16In other wing if the central ambulance bu ilding there are: dispensary, card-file, interventions, where there are standard medical devices of different age: EKG; Oxygen tank, inhalator. There is a special room for dental Roentg en device as well as Standard Ro device. Room with Ultra Sound devices with probes for trans-abdominal inspection of abdomen and special linear ultra-sound probe for the inspection of thyroid gland. Sterilization room with autoclave, distillatory as well as a device for dry sterilization of medical instruments. Room for minor surgical interventions with the adequate medical equipment, device for total anesthesia, a monitor, aspirator, thermo -cauter, necessary surgical instruments. The lab is equipped with the devices for co mplete blood screening as well as with the analyzer for complete bio-chemical analyses. Pharmacy- Adequate storing of sanitary materially, necessary supply of per oral and parenteral medicaments. There are also urine-t est strips for the identification of abuse of10 different psycho-active substances After detailed visit to Health Care service, ex istence and functioning of standard medical equipment does not exclude, but on the contrary, imposes the need for the existence and procurement of necessary medical equipment and devices for urgent medical conditions (which are standard for other primary and secondary p ublic health systems in Serbia). These are ambulance kit for reanimation, as well as a device called defibrillator. Also, there is not any ambulance vehicle equipped with standard medical devices like re- animobile for transportation of patients as well as those whose life is endangered, from the Penitentiary to the Clinical center Ni. 1.4. The Kitchen and the Dining room The dining room with 450 m2 is nice and pleasant, there are many flowers and the light is natural which is due to a number of windows. Th e coziness of the ambient is due to the flowers which are placed along the glazed wall from the face side. The outward fa\u00e7ade is all glassed while the backside of the dining room is half in parapet and the rest are big windows. The furniture is consisted of linked (clipped) green wooden tables (two tables with six chairs). The chairs are old, being replaced occ asionally. The dishes: the prisoners use knives, forks and spoons which are always put back after us e - after meal. The meals are served in plastic plates and glasses. Near the dining room there are urinal areas (rooms) with two squa t toilets and four washstands. The kitchen extends to 2500 m2. There are 21 rooms. The first and the biggest is a thermal block with 185 m2. Both walls and floor s are paneled and they are in a good condition. The lighting is natural and artific ial being controlled inside the kitchen. There is no need for heating due to the electrical kettles for food prep aring.

Admission ward Admissiom ward was renovated three years ago when the fasade was renewed and inward rooms painted. Now, one part of the f asade scales off due to the moisture from the the sanitary instalation. Inward, the walls are painted and up to 1,2 me tres high there is an oil strainer varnish being in sound condition. The painted area near the ceiling and on the ceiling is scaled off. The floors are with plastic panelling. The floor in the bedrooms is partially dama ged and it needs to be changed. The woodwork is clean and in a fairly good condition There is no artificial ventilation. The lightin g is natural and ther e is enough artificial light. There is a good central heating, the ward being next to the boiler room. The ward consists of three bedrooms, with 18 to 20 beds in each. There are bunk beds made of metal, in sound condition. The bed cloth is old but cl ean being washed in 15 days period. The blankets are washed after the prisoner's leaving. The matresses are quite old.

The Department for prisoners work The buildings in the workhouse were built in 1934 and they do not differ from the similar workhouses in Industry of Machinery in Ni. Manufacturing consists of the sectors such as: welding, metallic, tool house - servicing, warehouse, woodwork sector (produces chess boards per purchase order and for blind people) and the turnery. 18 The workhouse consists of: the sector for bo ilers and cookers, the printing office, tailor office (sewing and reparing uniforms for penitentiary needs), plumbing, strainer house, galvanizing, enameling (the only one in the city), maintenance room, fire department, and a small printing office (letter collating) All working rooms are with over 9.000 m2. Work safety is quite satisfactory. There is a safety equipment. The welders have got glasses, a safety mask, an apron and gloves. It is one working shift due to the lack of qualified workers and the lack of material expenses for purchasing of the auxiliary goods. Y ears ago inside the penitentiary there was a metallic school where the prisoners during their servitude could gain certain skills and high school certificate of technical ability. Today the workers can be only the ones who have gained the required skills before thei r arrival in the penitentiary . The roof of the galvanizing room is ruined and and it hasn't been repaired yet. Therefore, there are no adequate working conditions during rainy and snowy days. The windows are with bars, the lighting is both na tural and artificial. There is no heating at the working department. Warehouses: There are two warehouses. One for storing finished goods and the other for raw materials. The outward of the warehouses is very bad. The walls are not painted, it is just like the manufacturing sector. Boiler rooms: There are two boiler rooms. The one works properly and keeps warm A, B and C wards and the school. It is 50m2. There is a clean concrete floor, walls are painted. There is also sanitary instalation with shower baths. Th e shower baths are functional and this section is hygenically clean. There are two working shifts in the boiler room, 3 workers during the winter and 2 workers during the summer period.

The other boiler room keeps warm the rest of the buildings. There are three new boilers. The walls are in a sound condition with panelling. There is a concrete floor being washed with water. It is not kept so clean as the first one. The laundry: there are eight rooms with sanitary instalation.

The Department for unemployable prisoners (B4) The ward which is used to be called \"Holiday \" no longer exists. Now this is the ward for the unemployable prisoners. During the reside nce in the admitting ward the skill personell determines and labels the resi dence in this ward for the unemployable prisoners. A certain number of imprisoned have been moved by the penitentiary governance from the dormitory B4, being in a bad condition, to a new C4 dormitory, adapted with a TV room, three bedrooms, a new bathroom, the toilets and sanitary facilities. At the moment there are 36 people. The Ni penitentiary governance is going to move the prisoners to another building due to the very bad conditions. The ward is situated in a small ground floor building, with a little space for walking in front of the building. The facade of the building is quite ruined.

The School and the Library The library and the school are situated in th e former school centre building. The outward fasade is destroyed by fire during the riots in 2000. The library is a former demurely equippe d classroom. The walls have been recently painted, the woodwork is old but this year painte d. The floor is plastic, covered with a rug. The library consists of 2500 headings, 3300 boo ks including laws, in serbian, english and hungarian. The prisoners are not allowed to go to the library but only the dormitory librarion followed by the treatment officer. The school has being rebuilt for the past two years. At the very entrance of the object there is a guard room, recently painted, neat, e quipped with the office furniture and the TV. On the ground floor there is the dormitory C4. Across, there is a \"no drugs\" department. The base of the building is 50x12 m.The hallway on the first floor is plastic panelled.

There are 3 rooms with 12-13 pris oners and with 15 beds in each. The dormitory C4 is on the ground floor along with the library and the school (upstairs). This ward was built just before the \"no dr ugs ward\". There is a new heating and a sanitary system. It is next to (on the left), \"no drugs ward\" on the ground floor of the building. Since December, 2007 the freed of labour peisoners have beeen moved from dormitory C4 to dormitory B4. 1.11. Cultural centre The cultural centre was destroyed by fire duri ng the riots in 2000. All that is left are outwalls and concrete ground now used as a cour t by the prisoners from the II dormitory. The superficial dimension of the building is 250 m2. 1.12. Drug Free Ward During the second half of 2006 OSCE supported both in expert and in material way a pilot program \"Drug Free Ward\" so that they r econstructed the existing building of Pavilion C in Penitentiary Ni. Construction works started on July 24 th and they were completed on October 15th. The Ward was opened in January 2007 and it is intended for motivated persons deprived of liberty, users of psycho-active substances, who wa nt to live in their environment without drug abuse as well as to continue with that life style ev en after the end of the sentence and to turn to a healthier life style. Rule Book on the work of Drug Free Ward and regulations in it define the conditions of prisoners' stay in it, criteria for their selec tion, duration of stay, obligations, suitability, advantages, reclassification of sentenced prisoners as well as reasons for discontinuity of the stay. Stay in the Ward is voluntary based a nd possible only based on mutual agreement between the prisoners and professional staff, when the prisoner accepts, in written form, Rules of Stay, in the period from 6-12 months, with which he is acquainted. Treatment program is conducted as a team wo rk, so that the treatment and all the activities are under supervision of an expert co mmittee consisting of: health care workers (a doctor and medical technician-lab technician), officers from treatment service (psychologist and/or pedagogue, sociologist and/or social wo rker and/or special pedagogue), security officers (guard and guard supervisor). Urine testing, which is conducted periodi cally, according to specific indications, proves or precludes the existence of psycho-activ e substances with sentenced persons. Drug Free Ward takes up the space of 250 m2 where there are: -Three dormitories, with the capacity of, around 25 beds -Spacious sitting room with a TV hall, tea-kitche n, dining room, computer center, table for table tennis -Sanitary facilities with toilets, lavatories and shower booths 21-Room for occupational therapy- carving -Guard's room -Hall with shoe racks and a telephone booth -Walk with eaves At the moment, there are 11 sentenced prisoners, under the treatment in a Drug Free Ward, out of which 7 belong to B2 category. Fr om a short conversation with them we got an impression that general atmosphere of interpersona l relations is good as well as with the staff. They are extremely satisfied with the facilities they spend their time in. They also state that the use of the phone booth is liber al enough and that they can use the phone everyday till 9 o'clock p.m. The existence of Drug Free Ward, together w ith all the reconstructions of power supply network, sanitary facilities with new ceramics, ta ps and shower booths, central heating system, laminate floors in every room, new furniture, be ds, mattresses, beddings, painted walls, new grids on the windows, new net on the walk with new eav es, medical treatments and work with a target group, fulfills the criteria of a high-standard stay of the prisoners in Penitentiary. 1.13.

Treatment 2.1. 2.1.1. Torture and ill-treatment (physical violence exposure, tracks, ment al violence, the relations between the prisoners and the stuff, relations among the prisoners themselves) 2.1.2. Solitary confinement (the possible solitary confinemet period, who is responsible for solitary confinemet, whether the prisoners in solitary confinement are able to get 1 hour of recreation in fresh air, medical services/how often and on personal request) 2.1.3. Means of restraints (in which cases means of restraints are possible, whether all cases has been recorded, whether the prisoners are able to get medical services, how long means of restraints have been applied) 2.2.1. Selection of Articles of EPR and Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions related to Chapter 25 2.1.1. The project was realized after the riots at the penitentiary at Ni on November, 2005. so that the cases of physical violence of the prisoners from that period, and which the prisoners state about, have not been indicated. Regarding the interview carried out with the prisoners, the team members came into the conclusion that only a small number of interviewed prisoners is of the opinion of being exposed to the physical violence by the officers of the pe nitentiary even in those situations which were officially recorded as applied restraint measures. Only one of the interviewed prisoners stated during the visit \"6\" in the period of realization of the project that he was exposed to the physical violence by the members of the security service which was recorded in the medi cal documentation in compliance with the rules and ethics of the service . There are some discordance about the means used in injuring between the statement of the interviewed person and the medical documen tation. The discordance appears due to the position in which the interviewed was when being injured (he states he was on the floor with the hands on his head) so that he was unable to confirm about the means being used in the injuring. During the interview with the examinees being la tely injured by the officers in applying the restraint measures and according to the documentation of the medical service, it is concluded that they reject to talk about that particular event. It implies to either avoiding renewing trauma by speaking about it or they are afraid of the con sequences they would have due to the reporting. On the other hand, what become relative are the optimistic answers of the prisoners about the quantity of restraint measures applied and about the small number of recorded cases of applied measures of constraint conse quently being injured. The problem of psychological violence is slightly expressed partially due to the fact that the prisoners were not directly exposed to the violence or within the given answers they were unable to recognize a certain behavior as psychological violence since this kind of \"communication\" is considered normal and usual for the penitentiary conditions. The victim of any violence, especially psychological, continues to act according to the same model storing the frustration till becoming revolted and the people from the surrounding suffer or he imitates the behavior of the tyrant towards available victims in the surrounding. It is interesting fact not usually occurred that one of the interviewed was able to recognize his exposure to the psychological violence by the officials of the penitentiary. The recognizable aspect of the psychological violence is abrupt attitude with dispraise of the security service members towards the examin ee which was the case when he refused to be an informant about the possible other prisoners' rules violations. Besides a small number of the interviewed prisoners (at the time of the visits) recognizing the act of being exposed to the psychological violence, is not an indisputable proof that they weren't exposed. The answers to other qu estions confirm that the most prisoners are not able to recognize the situations of psychologi cal violence partially considering it normal and usual for penitentiary conditions. However, to a less \"difficult\" questions considering the relation between the prisoners and the officials of the pen itentiary they are able to give an answer. The overall opinion of the interviewed is that the relati on between the officials of the penitentiary and the prisoners are not good being diffe rent only in the estimation how bad they are. In that case the answers go from middling to agonizing and unbearable. 26The relations between the prisoners and the o fficials are still under the influence of the riots which took place in 2006. They are defined as tolerable but there is the possibility for their improvement. Probably one of the causes is a decreased mutual trust. At the same time, from the gained statistical data it can be concluded that in the secound half of the year 2007. there were less disciplin ary procedures against the imprisoned than it was the case in the first half of the year which implies that the situation is getting better. Regarding the behavior of the members of cer tain services the opinion is that the security service officers are unqualified for their practice meaning that they can handle everything by applying force and without showing any interest for dealing with the problems using some other means. As far as the warden is concerned the ones who met him consider he is correct and strict, but the overall opinion is that he is not always informed about the complaints end with the treatment officers eventually revenging themselve s upon the prisoners by depriving them of the advancement and certain rights. This doubt is, probably, the resu lt of the opinion of the most of the prisoners that submitting complaints to the director, the gove rnance and other authorities is only an act of formality and the main reason for not making the decision to do that. A number of the interviewed prisoners state that there are prisoners with certain additional privileges given by the officials of the pen itentiary at Ni. This privilege is reflected in: unrestricted making of phone calls (which certain ly implies the more frequent possibility of making phone calls than it is provided); the eased tr ansfer to the B2 dormitory; an abrupt going to the canteen; holding the queue in the canteen which unables the other prisoners to buy what is needed within the same short period of time provi ded for a walk; \"The privileged\" are enabled to receive the packages more frequently and without re striction in terms of the type and the quality of food which is considered for the ot her penitentiary population. Among the privileged are \"the tippers\" and \"the tipping\" is paied with the privileges. The other group of the privileged/preffered are the wealthy ones (they communicate with the guards through their relatives and, according to the statemen t of the prisoners, pay for their transfer to a better dormitory), as well as the prisoners being th e main dealers of the forbidden goods at the penitentiary. Regarding the relations among the prisoners themselves almost all of the interviewed consider them indifferent or bad. The verbal conflicts often turn into violence and physical conflict. The physical conflicts with the usage of certain physical means are quite frequent and according to the interviewed the main cause is drug i.e. the debts which is the result of the drug trades at the penitentiary. The drug can indirectly be the cause of the conf lict, as it is in the case stated by the two interviewed prisoners. They state that the conflicts th ey are engaged in results in the fact that they are the only one in the room not being drug a ddicts during the servitude. According to their opinion they are in the position on one hand to be exposed to the danger of physical violence, drug addicts and drug dealers and on the other hand causes further danger of putting under the forbidden good in order to be compromised and eliminated from the close surrounding. Regarding the interrealtion among the prisoners themselves the power results not only in money but also in goods possesion.. The relation between the prisoners - members of the various ethnical and religious groups depends on their numerical quantity: when the numbe r of majority group members is equal to the number of other existing groups th e relationship is good. 27The majority of the Romas is poor so that they are consequentially discriminated since they are required to work for others. Being ad itionally employed at the penitentiary they are engaged in duties nobody wants to do, which is th e same for the Romas out of the penitentiary. The opinions of the interviewed prisoners about th e attitude towards Romas is that it is the worst at the dormitory \"C\", have been recorded by the team. Regarding the existence of the racquet within the informal groups the overall opinion of the prisoners is that it is mainly represented at the \"C\" dormitory later resulting in conflicts and injuring. Almost all of them is of the opinion that the stuff is extremely corrupted and that everything is for sale at the penitentiary. It is stated that the existed corruption fosters the importations of drug and mobile phones into the penitentiary, and the work positions being on a sort of illegal trade. According to the interviewed the informal groups exist without being organized by sectors but the type of \"extra activities\" put illega lly in practice. The overall opinion is that they are absolutely allowed to do everything being under the full protection of the penitentiary stuff. a)The violence in general In the EC progress report for Serbia in 200 7. (p. 12) it is especially emphasized the existence of a serious problem of violence at the penitentiaries in Serbia. We tried to determine the position of the penitentiary at Ni as far as th e violence is concerned during our visit having another preferred aim. Regarding the analyses, the violence was dis tinguished into sectors: the violence of the prisoners against the guards, the violence of the guards against the prisoners (the possible cases of torture), the violence among the imprisoned popul ation and the violence of the prisoners towards themselves. The sources being used: the statistical data gained from the penitentiary (the violence prisoners - guards; medically treated injuries of the prisoners caused by the other prisoners) and the interviews with the prisoners regarding our free choice. Recognizing the possible cases of ill- treatment of the prisoners is consisted in the project. The violence the prisoners apply towards themselves (self injuring being with different outcomes), has not been included yet. The prisoner - guard violence Out of six recorded prisoners' assaults agai nst the members of the security service during 2007. the three cases were defined as an attempt. One of the attempted assaults was the syringe assault filled with a blood of the prisoner being intr avenous heroin addict infected by the hepatitis C virus against the member of the security service and the practitioners. The officials were in danger of being infected not only by direct injection into the skin but also by sputtering the blood in the face (eyes, nose, mouth). The prisoner - prisoner violence According to the recorded injuries in 2007. it can be concluded that the frequency of conflicts among the prisoners was at the reasonabl e intensity. During the first three months there were 6 injuries recorded followed by the three month period without any incident. Since the end of June the conflict escalated so that till the end of December there were 31 recorded injuries. In regard to the statistical data it is obvi ous that the intensity of a violent behavior was especially increased during the summer period as we ll as in November. During the last year hot summer period the penitentiary was frequently wit hout water (it was impossible to take a shower, water in bottles was used for washing and cleaning the toilets) which contributed to the tension. In November there was an abrupt transfer of a great number of prisoners from the penitentiary at 28Sremska Mitrovica and at the same time this is a period of the year with the most cases of sum up crisis. Few number of injuries were caused by using the side-arm weapons and to them similar means whereas in the most of the cases those were standard fights. As a result there were three filed criminal charges by the offici als at the penitentiary Ni. Most of the injuries are the head and face in juries (33 out of 38) one being a heavy bodily injure - a jaw fracture being operated on. It should be mentioned that this analyses was carried out only according to the medical records of injuries tr eated so that the objective number of violent behavior among the prisoners as well as injuries is certainly higher. The opinions of the prisoners about the prisoner - prisoner violence: Almost all of the interviewed prisoners point ed out that the main cause of the violence escalation is the fact that the prisoners with a less financial status are being involved in dept at the other prisoners not only in order to purchase a llowed goods but also fo r purchasing forbidden goods, mainly narcotics. The expounded type of violence is psychological violence in terms of threats eventually turning into the physical violence resulting in slaying and stitching. The individuals as well as groups are equally mentioned as the participants of the violent behavior. The prisoners are of the opinion th at the violent act is a power demonstration and maintenance of the group power. This message sent by the act of violence is not only directed to the immediate victim but it also bears a wider, warning notice to the rest of the prisoners. - The violence of the prisoners toward themselves (The source: the written response gained from the governance regarding the issue about the number and the type of self injuring in 2007). According to the injuries record ed in 2007. it can be stated that the number of these cases is quite small (21) compared to the overall impr isoned population (about 1.100) and particularly if it is taken into account that almost in the half of the registered cases (9) are the people without the status of imprisoned but being in custody. Regarding the compiled answers containing the medical treated cases it can not be concluded whether there were some self injuring cases with a fatal outcome or all of them were relatively trivial. In 2007. there were no suicide cases (considered as the self violence with a fatal outcome). From the medical point of view the most cases consist of injuries like cuts and grazes caused by a sharp object (razor) usually in the region of extremities and stomach. The self injuring is an act with the autodestructive feature so that always being an appeal referred to others. The measures for restriction of the violence: According to the opinion of the interviewed pr isoners the measures for restriction of the violence are carried out partially. The prisoners being the victims of the violen ce have been transfered to the Department for Special Surveillance due to the safety measure s, whereas the ones applying violence have not been isolated. This approach seems illogical and it can be \"justified\" only due to the lack of the capacity. It shouldn't be accepted as a sta ndard in approaching the problem. 2.1.2. It is legislated by The Law on Execusion of Penal Sanctions that the maximum period of time the prisoners should stay in solitary confinem ent is 15 days, being confirmed by some of the imprisoned. However, few of the prisoners menti on that this legislated period of time is not 29always obeyed so that the solitary confinement period can even last for a month. The prisoners are of the opinion that the disciplinary commisi on is responsible for directing into the solitary confinement whereas few of them consider it is th e director's decision. Before being sent to the solitary confinement the prisoners go through th e health check, then once a day, being more frequent if it is needed. The interviewed prisoners during the later vis its were quite informed with the maximal period of time provided for the staying at solitary confinement as well as about who is responsible about the procedure. They all ag ree that their right for staying outside for an hour a day is obeyed during the period of solitary confinement. They c onfirmed about the regular medical check before being sent to the solitary confinement but a few of the interviewed state that the health check during the solitary confinement is carried out only occasionally by the request of the prisoner even then being optional. None of the interv iewed mentioned that they were visited by the treatment officers during the solitary confinement ev en if it is legislated by the Law on Execution of Penal Sanctions that the treatment officers are obliged to visit the prisoner being at the solitary confinement at least once in a week. The interviewed officers confirmed that appl ying of the solitary confinement measures is always in accordance with the Law on Execution of Penal Sanctions. 2.1.3. The means of restriction are allowed in the following cases: in directing the imprisoned out of the penitentiary, in order to preven t prisonbreaking or repression active or passive resistence, preventing the attempt of self injuring or further provoking of physical demage. The prisoners are not informed enough not onl y about the conditions for applying the means of restriction but also what they are consisted of. The most of the interviewed have, directly or indirectly, faced the means of restriction during their servitude at the penitentiary. They ar e generally able to recognize the situations when the applying of these measures is allowed, but they are not quite aware only of the fact what measures of restriction actually stand for but also that each and every individual being treated by the measures of restriction is obliged to go thro ugh medical check after being treated by applying those measures. 302.2. Selection of Articles of EPR and Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions related to Chapter TREATMENT * European Prison Rules ** Commentary to Recommendation Rec (2006) 2 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the European Prison Rules *** Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions Torture and ill-treatment 64.1 Prison staff shall not use force against prisoners except in self-defence or in cases of attempted escape or active or passive physical resistance to a lawful order and always as a last resort. 64.2 The amount of force used shall be the mini mum necessary and shall be imposed for the shortest necessary time. ** Rule 64 reinforces the principle that sta ff may only use force within clearly defined limits and in response to a specific threat to security or good order. As a general rule prevention of a violent inci dent is always better than having to deal with it. Alert staff who know their prisone rs, will be able to identify the disruptive elements and to prevent violent acts. Good professional relationships between sta ff and prisoners are an essential element of dynamic security in de-escalating potential in cidents or in restoring good order through a process of dialogue and negotiation. Only when these methods fail or are considered inappropriate should physical methods of rest oring order be considered. When force has to be used against prisoners by staff it should be controlled and should be at the minimum level necessary to restore order. 65. There shall be detailed procedures about the use of force including stipulations about: a. the various types of force that may be used; b. the circumstances in which each type of force may be used; c. the members of staff who are entitled to use different types of force; d. the level of authority required before any force is used; and e. the reports that must be completed once force has been used. **Rule 65 This Rule lists the main issu es to be dealt with in the procedures which should be in place defining the use of force, (when it may be used, who is entitled to use it, who is entitled to authorise its use and the reporting m echanisms to be observed after any use of force). 66. 31 Staff who deal directly with prisoners sha ll be trained in techniques that enable the minimal use of force in the restraint of prisoners who are aggressive. **Rule 66 This Rule makes it clear that staff should not have to rely on simply overpowering troublesome prisoners by a show of superior physical force. There is a variety of control and restraint techniques in which staff can be trained which will allow them to gain control without injuring either themselves or the prisoners involve d. Management should be aware of what these are and should ensure that all staff are co mpetent in the basic skills and that sufficient staff ar e trained in advanced techniques. 67.1 Staff of other law enforcement agencies sha ll only be involved in dealing with prisoners inside prisons in exceptional circumstances. 67.2 There shall be a formal agreement between th e prison authorities and any such other law enforcement agencies unless the relationship is already regulated by domestic law. 67.3 Such agreement shall stipulate: a. the circumstances in which members of ot her law enforcement agencies may enter a prison to deal with any conflict; b. the extent of the authority which such other law enforcement agencies shall have while they are in the prison and their relationship with the director of the prison; c. the various types of force that me mbers of such agencies may use; d. the circumstances in which each type of force may be used; e. the level of authority required before any force is used; and f. the reports that must be completed once force has been used. **Rule 67 This Rule deals with the intervention in prison of law enforcement agencies. In exceptional circumstances it may be that the level of prisoner violence is so great that prison staff cannot themselves contain it and will need to call on another law enforcement agency, such as the police. Such a course of action needs to be handled with great care. In dealing with violence prison st aff will always be conscious that they will have to deal with prisoners after the incident has been resolved a nd life has returned to normal. This means that they will usually tr y to avoid using force and in any event will be reluctant to use inordinate or indiscriminat e force. This may not be a consideration for other law enforcement officials who do not normally work in the prison setting and who come in only to resolve a violent incident. In order to prevent excessive use of force in these circumstances it is recommended th at the prison authorities should agree a standing protocol with the senior management of any other agency that may be called on to help resolve a violent incident. All staff likely to be involved should be made aware of the contents of this protocol before entering the prison. 25.4 Particular attention shall be paid to th e needs of prisoners who have experienced physical, mental or sexual abuse . **Rule 25 underlines that the prison author ities should not concentrate only on specific rules, such as those relating to work, edu cation and exercise, but should review the overall prison regime of all prisoners to see that it meets basic requirements of human dignity. Such activities should cover the period of a normal working day. It is unacceptable to keep prisoners in their cells for 23 hours out of 24, for example. The 32CPT has emphasised that the aim shall be that the vari ous activities undertaken by prisoners should take them out of their cells for at least eight hours a day [see CPT's 2nd General Report (CPT/Inf (92) para. 47].. Particular attention should be paid to ensure that prisoners that are not in work, such as prisoners who have passed the retirement age, are kept active in other ways. This Rule also makes specific reference to the welfare needs of prisoners and thereby provides the impulse for the prison authorities to see that the multiple welfare needs of prisoners are catered for, either by the pr ison service or welfare agencies within other parts of the state system. Specific reference is made to the need to provide support to prisoners, both male and female , who may have been physically, mentally or sexually abused. Note also that Rule 101 allows untried pris oners to request access to the regimes for sentenced prisoners. *** Article 127 During execution of prison sentence, the prisone r is ought to behave in line with law and regulations brought based on the Law, as well as orders of the authoriti es, except for the case when the execution of the order is an illicit action. With an aim to maintain good order and safety in the prison, the prisoner can be a subject of only those measures for maintaining good order and safety, which are defined by this Law and regulations brought based on this Law and only in the amount which is needed. While implementing measures for maintaining good order and safety, no stricter measure than necessary needed can be implemented, bear ing in mind the nature if the measure, its implementation and contents of the measure. Measures for maintaining good order and safety are compulsory measures and special measures. Article 128 Compulsory measures can be implemented on the prisoner only when it is necessary to prevent: 1) Prisoner's escape 2) Physical attack on other person 3) Injuring of other person 4) Self-injuring 5) Causing of material damage 6) Active and passive resistance of the prisoner Compulsory measure can be also implemented on the person that illegally frees the prisoner or illegally enters the premises of the prison. This person is detained until the arrival of the authorized internal affairs officers. 33Article 129 Compulsory measures are: 1) Use of physical force; 2) restraints; 3) isolation; 4) use of rubber nightstick; 5) use of water hoses (snuffs); 6) use of chemical means and 7) use of fire-arms When implementing a compulsory measure, th e measure that the least endangers life and health of the person on which it is applied is implemented, but with which the resistance is put down successfully and it is propo rtional to the threatening danger. Article 130 The person on whom the compulsory measure w ill be implemented is orally and clearly warned, unless it is the case of simultaneous or immediate forthcoming illicit attack. Use of water hoses (snuffs) and chemical mean s can be ordered only by the Penitentiary Warden. After the implementation of the measure, medical check of the prisoner on which the measure is implemented, is mandatory. In next 24 hours, medical check is repeated for two times, in equal time intervals. Written report on the implementation of compulsory measure and done medical check from the Paragraph 3 of this Article is submitted to the governor of the prison Article 133 The member of Security service takes up the ac tions in order to prevent the prisoner from escaping, without delay. The member of Security service immediately informs the Penitentiary Warden about the escape attempt and escape of the prisoner. The gover nor is obliged to inform the Director of the Directorate. In case of prisoner's escape, the Penitentiary Wa rden informs the organ of internal affairs which is in charge, orders the issuing of wa rrant and takes up other actions necessary to apprehend escaped prisoner. During the period of escape, the carrying out of the sentence is stopped. Solitary confinement 60.5 Solitary confinement shall be imposed as a punishment only in exceptional cases and for a specified period of time, which shall be as short as possible. ** Solitary confinement, mentioned in Rule 60.5, refers to all forms of removing prisoners from association with other prisoners by placing them alone in a cell or a room. It should not be considered an appropriate punishment other than in most exceptional 34circumstances. This Rule is confirmed by Principle 7 of the United Nations Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners . There are various forms of solitary confinement. The most extreme occurs when an individual is held entirely on his or her own and is subject to sensory deprivation by lack of access to light, sound or fresh air in what are often called \u2014dark cells\". This form of isolation should never be imposed as a punishment. Another form of solitary confinem ent occurs when a prisoner is held in a single cell with access to normal light and air and can hear prisoners moving in adjacent areas. This type of punishment should only be used in exceptional circumstances for short periods of time. During this period, pr ison staff shall make regular and reasonably frequent contact with these prisoners. (See the commentary on Rule 42). The CPT pays particular attention to the use of solitary conf inement, or any conditions similar to it. It has noted that \u2014Solitary confinement can, in certain circumstances, amount to inhuman and degrading treatment; in any event, all forms of solitary confinement should be as short as possible\" (CPT, 2General Report on the CPT's Activities, para 56). It must be stressed that the requirement of one hour of daily outdoor exercise for prisoners (Rule 27.1) applies equally to in mates placed in solitary confinement as a punishment. Such prisoners should also be pr ovided with reading material. The same applies to prisoners under special high security (Rule 53). 27.1 Every prisoner shall be provide d with the opportunity of at least one hour of exercise every day in the open air, if the weather permits. 27.2 When the weather is inclement alternative a rrangements shall be made to allow prisoners to exercise. 27.3 Properly organised activities to promote ph ysical fitness and provide for adequate exercise and recreational opportunities shall form an integral part of prison regimes. 27.4 Prison authorities shall facilitate such activ ities by providing appropriate installations and equipment. 27.5 Prison authorities shall make arrangements to organise special activities for those prisoners who need them. 27.6 Recreational opportunities, which include spor t, games, cultural activities, hobbies and other leisure pursuits, shall be provided and, as far as possible, prisoners shall be allowed to organise them. 27.7 Prisoners shall be allowed to associate with each other during exercise and in order to take part in recreational activities. Prisoners shall have access to the health services available in the country without discrimination on the grounds of their legal situation. ** Rule 27 It is important to emphasise, as the place ment of Rule 27 does, that all prisoners, including those subject to disciplinary punishment, need exercise and recreation although these activities should not be compulsory. Opportunities for exercise and recreation must be made available to all pris oners rather than only as part of a treatment and training programme for sentenced prisoners . This is in line with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, which deal with exercise and 35sport in Rule 24 of its general part. The im portance of exercise for all prisoners is underlined by the CPT in its 2General Repor t [CPT/Inf (92)3] para. 47. The one-hour a day period of physical exercise is a minimum that should be applied to all prisoners who do not get sufficient exercise through their wo rk. Facilities for outdoor exercise should be sufficient to permit prisoners to exert themselves physically. Provision for physical exercise should be complemented by recreational opportunities to make prison life as normal as possible. The organisation of sport and recreation provide an ideal opportunity for involving prisoners in an important aspect of prison life and for developing their social and interpersonal skills . It is also an occasion on which prisoners can exercise their right of association. This ri ght is protected article 11 of the ECHR and, while it is severely limited in the prison cont ext by the requirements of good order, it is not abolished entirely: see also the comment on Rule 52.3 in part IV. Rule 27.5. provides for prisoners who have a need for physical exercise of a specialised nature: for example, a prisoner who has been injured may require additional exercises to build up wasted muscles. 41.2 Arrangements shall be made to ensure at all times that a qualified medical practitioner is available without delay in cases of urgency **Rule 41 A basic requirement to ensure that prisone rs do have access to health care whenever required is that there should be a medical practitioner appointed to every prison. The medical practitioner referred to should be a fully qualified medical doctor. In large prisons a sufficient number of doctors should be appointed on a full-time basis. In any event a doctor should always be available to deal with urgent health matters. This requirement is confirmed in Recommenda tion N\u00b0 R (98) 7 of the Committee of Ministers. In addition to doctors, there should be othe r suitably qualified health care personnel. In some Eastern European countries para-med icals (sometimes called \u2014feldshers\") reporting to a doctor also deliver medical assi stance and care. Other important group will be properly trained nurses. In 1998 the Inte rnational Council of Nurses published a statement which says, among other things, that national nursing associations should provide access to confidential advice, c ounsel and support for prison nurses. [The Nurse's Role in the Care of Prisoners and Detainees, International Council of Nurses, 1998]. In dealing with prisoners, doctors should apply the same professional principles and standards that they would apply in working outside prisons. This principle was confirmed by the International Council of Prison Medical Services when it agreed the Oath of Athens: \u2014We, the health professionals who are worki ng in prison settings, m eeting in Athens on September 10, 1979, hereby pledge, in keeping with the spirit of the Oath of Hippocrates, that we shall endeavour to prov ide the best possible health care for those who are incarcerated in prisons for whatever reasons, without prejudice and within our respective professional ethics\". This is also required by the first of the UN Principles of Medical Ethics relevant to the Role of Health Personnel, particularly Phys icians, in the Protection of Prisoners and Detainees against Torture and Other Crue l, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 43.2 The medical practitioner or a qualified nurse reporting to such a medical practitioner s hall pay particular attention to the heal th of prisoners held under conditions of 36solitary confinement, shall visit such prisoners daily, and shall provide them with prompt medical assistance and treatment at the request of such prisoners or the prison staff. **Rule 43 This Rule implies that individual prisoner s are entitled to regular, confidential access to appropriate levels of medical consultation wh ich is at least the equivalent to that available in civil society. The conditions under which prisoners are interviewed about their health should be the equivalent of t hose that apply in civil medical practice. Wherever possible they should take place in a ppropriately equipped consulting rooms. It is unacceptable for consultation to take place w ith groups of prisoners or in the presence of other prisoners or non-medical staff. Duri ng medical examinations prisoners shall not be handcuffed or physically separated from the medical practitioner. Under no circumstances should they be requi red to disclose their reasons for seeking a consultation to other staff if they have to submit their request for access to a doctor to them. The arrangements for seeking a medical consultation should be made clear to prisoners on admission to the prison. The medical records of individual prisone rs should remain under the control of the medical practitioner and should not be disclo sed without the prior written authorisation of the prisoner. In some countries prison h ealth care services come under the jurisdiction of civilian health care provision. In addition to the benefits discussed in \"The right to healthcare' above such arrange ments also help to establish clearly that medical records are not part of general prison records. The treatment provided as a result of c onsultation and diagnosi s should be that which is in the best intere sts of the individual pris oner. Medical judgments and treatments should be based on the needs of the individual pr isoner and not on the needs of the prison administration. Recommendation N\u00b0 R (98) 7 of the Committee of Ministers emphasises that pr isoners should give informed consent before any physical examination or treatment, as does the CPT's 3General Report. Recommendation N\u00b0 R (98) 7 of the Committee of Ministers notes the need to pay special attention to the needs of prisoners with physical handicaps and to provide facilities to assist them on lines similar to those in the outside environment. In a judgment in July 2001 [Price v. United Kingdom (33394/96)] the European Court of Human Rights found a violation of article 3 of the ECHR in respect of the treatment of a severely handicapped person in prison despite the fact that it found no evidence of any positive intention on the part of the pris on authorities to humiliate or debase the applicant. One consequence of the increase in the length of sentences in some jurisdictions is that prison administration has to respond to the needs of growing numbers of elderly prisoners. In some countries the recent tre nd towards mandatory life or long sentences has led to a significant increase in prisoners who will become old in prison. Prison administrations will need to give particular consideration to the different problems, both social and medical, of this group of prisoners . This may require the provision of a range of specialist facilities to deal with the pr oblems arising from a loss of mobility or the onset of mental deterioration. Special considerations will apply to prisoners who become terminally ill and a decision may have to be made as to whether such prisoners should be released early from their sentences. Any diagnosis made or advice offe red by prison medical staff should be based on professional judgment and in the best interests of the prisoner. Recommendation N\u00b0 R (98) 7 of the Committee of Ministers indicates that the decision as to when such patients should be transferred to outside hospital units should be taken on medical grounds. In a judgment in November 2002 [Mouisel v. France (appl. nr. 67263/01 14/11/2002] the 37European Court of Human Rights found a violation of Article 3 of the ECHR in respect of the medical treatment of a terminally ill prisoner. It noted a positive obligation on the state to offer adequate medical treatment and criticised the fact that the prisoner had been handcuffed to a hospital bed. In anothe r case in October 2003 [H\u00e9naf v. France (55524/00)] the Court found a violation of Article 3 of the ECHR in the treatment of a sick prisoner who had been chained to a hospital bed. Recommendation No. R (98) 7 of the Committe e of Ministers makes reference to the treatment of prisoners who are on hunger strike. It stresses that clinical assessment of a hunger striker should only take place with th e express permission of the patient unless there is a severe mental disorder, which requi res transfer to a psychiatric service. Such patients should be given a full explanation of the possible harmful effects of their action on their long-term well-being. Any action that the medical practitioner (doctor) takes must be in accordance with national law and professional standards. Medical practitioners or qualified nurses should not be obliged to pronounce prisoners fit for punishment but may advise prison authoriti es of the risks that certain measures may pose to the health of prisoners. They would have a particular duty to prisoners who are held in conditions of solitary confinement fo r whatever reason: for disciplinary purposes; as a result of their \u2014 dangerousness\" or their \u2014 troublesome\" behaviour; in the interests of a criminal investigation; at their own request. Following established practice, (see for example Rule 32.3 of the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners) such prisoners should be visited daily. Such visits can in no way be considered as condoning or legitimising a decision to put or to keep a prisoner in solitary confinement. Moreover, medical practitioners or qualifie d nurses should respond promptly to request for treatment by prisoners held in such cond itions or by prison staff as required by para. 66 of Recommendation N\u00b0 R (98) 7 on ethical and organisational aspects of health care in prison. *** Article 68 Prisoner has a right to spend at least two hours outdoor, in their free time. Prisoner, whose age and physical abilities allow it, has a right to perform, in his free time, organized physical activity, including right to use sport terrains, devices and equipment, together with other prisoners. Article 150 Disciplinary measure of sending to a solitary conf inement is declared exclusively, only for serious disciplinary offences and can last no longer than 15 days. Disciplinary measure of sending to a solitary confinement for the period up to 30 days is possible to be declared only for concat enation of disciplinary offences. . Article 151 Disciplinary measure of sending to a solitary c onfinement represents the exclusion of the prisoner from joint activities with other prisoners, in his free time, during whole day or night. Before the execution of sending to a solitary conf inement, a medical check of the prisoner is mandatory. 38Article 156 Procedure for serious disciplinary offences is led and decided upon by the Disciplinary Commission and for less serious disciplinary offe nces by the Penitentiary Warden or a person appointed by him, bearing in mind that that person cannot be the proponent. Proposal for the initiation of disciplinary proce dure is submitted by the administrator of the organizational unit in the Penitentiary or a person appointed by him. Proposal for the initiation of disciplinary proce dure from the Paragraph 2 of this Article is submitted within 24 hours from the cognition of the committed offence. Disciplinary Commission from the Paragraph 1 of this Article is appointed by the Director of Directorate, based on the proposal of the Penitentiary Warden. Means of restraints 68.1 The use of chains and irons shall be prohibited. 68.2 Handcuffs, restraint jackets and other body restraints shall not be used except: a. if necessary, as a precaution against escape during a transfer, provided that they shall be removed when the prisoner appears before a judicial or administrative authority unless that authority decides otherwise; or b. by order of the director, if other methods of control fail, in order to protect a prisoner from self-injury, injury to others or to prevent serious damage to property, provided that in such instances the director shall immediately inform the medical practitioner and report to the higher prison authority. 68.3 Instruments of restraint shall not be applied for any longer time than is strictly necessary. 68.4 The manner of use of instruments of restra int shall be specified in national law. **Rule 68 This Rule is largely identical to Rule 39 in the previous Rules. Since the 1987 Rules were published there has been a much greater use of restraints on prisoners in a variety of circumstances in a number of member states. However, the principles to be applied to the use of instruments of restraint have not ch anged in the intervening years. It is worth repeating the relevant section of the Expl anatory Memorandum to the 1987 Rules. \u2014The use of such apparatus in coercive circumst ances rightly bears implications that are morally repugnant to civilised conduct. Their use must, therefore, be strictly controlled and avoided wherever possible. There are, however, inevitably occasions on which physical restraint will need to be applied w ith the additional help of specially designed equipment or instruments in order to prevent physical injury to the prisoners concerned or to staff, escape or unacceptable damage. These rules are designed to set acceptable limits within which such restraint may be employed\". Routine use of instruments of restraint is not acceptable, e.g. to escort prisoners to the prison. The former Rule 39.b has been deleted. This allowed the use of instruments of restraint on medical grounds, by direction and under the supervision of the medical practitioner. The circumstances covered by the new Rule 68.2.b (formerly Rule 39.c) still permit the exceptional use of restraint on the basis of th e need to protect the prisoner or others. Rule 68.4 provides for the ultimate authority for the use of instruments of restraint to be vested in law or regulation and not depend on the discretion of the prison administration. 39 *** Article 128 Compulsory measures can be implemented on the prisoner only when it is necessary to prevent: 7) Prisoner's escape 8) Physical attack on other person 9) Injuring of other person 10) Self-injuring 11) Causing of material damage 12) Active and passive resistance of the prisoner Compulsory measure can be also implemented on the person that illegally frees the prisoner or illegally enters the premises of the prison. This person is detained until the arrival of the authorized internal affairs officers. Article 129 Compulsory measures are: 8) Use of physical force; 9) restraints; 10) isolation; 11) use of rubber nightstick; 12) use of water hoses (snuffs); 13) use of chemical means and 14) use of fire-arms When implementing a compulsory measure, th e measure that the least endangers life and health of the person on which it is applied is implemented, but with which the resistance is put down successfully and it is propo rtional to the threatening danger. 403. Protection measures 3.1. 3.1.1. Informing the persons deprived of liberty (The kind of information they get at admission, in which form, the languages the prisoners speak, the house rules/in which place and in what way it is exposed, whether it is easily consulted; whether th e content of the House rules comply with the essential ascribed standards, whether it is clearly defined) 3.1.2. Inspection (Independent inspection, whether the prisoners have access to it) 3.1.3. Disciplinary procedures (Which acts and omissions are punishable; the authority competent to impose such punishment ; whether the detainee is allowed to defend himself; whether the detainee is informed of the nature of the accusations; the types and duration of punishment that may be imposed; what is the mechanism of the appellate process; whether there is any appellate process with a positive outcome; how many detainees have been punished durin g a certain period in regard to the overall number of prisoners). 3.1.4. Complaints procedures (What kind of complaints the detainees can submit; what is the nature of the complaints - administrative/judicial; what the complaints procedure look like; whether the complaints procedure is easily available; whether there is a possibility of external complaints submitted against th e institution; how long the settlement of complaints lasts; how many complaints h ave been made for the last 6 months in regard to the approximate number of deta inees; how many complaints have been settled in favor of the complainant) 3.1.5. Registers (The register of the punished prisoners; whether all incidents are registered) 3.1.6. Separation of categories of detainees (Whether the sensitive categories of detainees are separately situated; who is responsible for accommodation and what is taken into account; whether the detainees can ask for change of accommodati on; if they can, what is taken into account; what are the measures for preventi on of ill-treatment and sexual violence) 3.2. Selection of Articles of EPR and Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions related to Chapter 41 3.1.1. Informing persons deprived of liberty: Pris oners should get introduced with the Rule book of House Rules at the admission in the Pen itentiary. Answers of interviewees differ, no matter whether it was orally done or the text was made available to them in written form. During several visits we found out from intervie wees that almost none of them was given any information at the admission in the Penitentiary or their rights were retold in short, and in order to introduce with it in more details they were direct ed to House Rules that are supposed to be in every department. However, they say that Hou se Rules are not posed on visible place, except for the Admission Department and that is why they became aware of the fact that something is forbidden only when the violation of some rule is already done (without going into more details who and why destroys House Rules after they are posed). The following question comes up- it is informing of illiterate prisoners, whether they are paid enough time and efforts in or der to understand what is presented, so that they could equally realize their right to information and not to be discriminated in comparison to literate prisoners Information received from interviewed literate prisoners about informing illiterate ones that were just admitted, is that illiterate prisone rs are directed to literate ones of whose good will and mood depends when and if they will read th em out a certain rule or write a request or complaint. We also found out from interviewees th at illiterate prisoners were forced to pay in material goods (cigarettes and si milar) to literate ones, for wr iting different applications or reading of House Rules and similar. In this way, illiterate prisoners are discriminated in comparison to those literate. At the moment (April 2008) there are 29 illiterate prisoners in Penitentiary Ni, which is not a great number. It would be preferable to provide additional assistance to illiterate prisoners that should be re gularly available, in respect of writing of different applications and intr oduction with House Rules contents and other texts relevant for them. House rules are visibly posed as long as it is torn by prisoners. Contents of House rules are in line with valid laws. Formulation is too specialized, arid non-understandable and unadjusted to capabilities of a greater number of prisoners (and in gene ral population that does not deal with legal matters). From the conversati on with the prisoners it is clear that even those prisoners who know the procedure and further key elements of the procedure, either don't know the rules or they are introduced with them by more experienced prisoners. 3.1.2. Only one of all interviewed prisoners had met with representatives of some NGO, before our visit. It was Helsinki Committee for Human ri ghts which had visited Pe nitentiary Ni before. Others, in smaller number know that Red Cross vi sits Penitentiary, although some of them think that that was in previous period and only because of foreign prisoners. One of interviewees said that during Red Cross' visit he requested to talk to them, but it was prohibited by a member of Security Service (the officer told him that he was not allowed) 3.1.3. Disciplinary procedures: Offences that ar e subject to disciplinary procedures are contained in the Rule Book of disciplinary me asures. Disciplinary commission brings a decision 42on a procedure based on the written request issued by a warden, who acts upon a notification of an officer. From the prisoners interviewed so far only one explicitly stated that he was deprived of the right to defend himself, that he was read out a report by which he was accused of disciplinary offence, and when he tried to repl y he was interrupted and said that he would be informed in half an hour. Based on the Report received from the Penitentiary Ni it could be concluded that in last six months (information required on 09.07.07.) fo r minor disciplinary offences, in greatest number of cases, the most minor measure was declared- reproof, while for more than a half of the cases the most severe disciplinary measure was declared- sending to a solitary confinement. Only in one case a person was freed from responsib ility for a severe disciplinary offence. In the period of 6 months, on which the da ta received from the Penitentiary is based, there were 262 disciplinary procedures were conducte d, which, in comparison to total number of prisoners, represents 1/4. Prisoners interviewed during implementation of the project know which behavior is punishable and is a subject of initiation of Discip linary procedure, but none of the prisoners is able to list all punishable behaviors. Most often, as punishable behavior, they specify the refusal of order, import of forbidden things and attack on officer. These prisoners less understand their rights during disciplinary procedures and without exception consider that disciplinary measure is brought by Disciplinary Commission, not by a Warden. They think that the presence of a lawyer , before and during disciplinary procedure, is useless because in any case the decision brought wo uld be to disadvantage of a person against whom the procedure is conducted. To the additio nal question related to the engagement of a defender, all interviewees replied that a reason fo r not engaging a defender out of the Penitentiary was that they would have to cover the costs of a lawyer and that that was too much for them. Impression is that interviewees are pretty discouraged in respect of their chances in eventual disciplinary procedure against them and that on the other hand they are almost completely uninterested in getting introduced w ith the way in which they could protect their rights in appellate procedure as well as in the process of lodging complaints to a treatment by Penitentiary officers. 3.1.4. Prisoners have a weak understanding of the pr ocedures and reasons for a complaint, and almost without exceptions, don't use expert legal assistance. It is probably the reason why only one prisoner's complaint was adopted. From conversation with some of the prisoners it can be concl uded that all the complaints do not reach the person they are intended to, i.e. the Warden. In monitored period of six months (information required on 09.07.07.), total number of lodged complaints to officers' work is 18, while only one was solved in favor of a prisoner. It is, maybe, the best indicator of certain prisoners' unconcern for lodging complaints and their belief that lodging complaints will not improve their position. Interviewees were introduced, without exception, with the possibility to lodge complaints to the Warden. They are not much interested in lodging complaints to the Department in charge of supervision because they don't be lieve in efficacy of that action. The prisoners have insufficient knowledge of the procedure of lodging complaints to treatment by officers and especially the right s they have in disciplinary procedure. Smaller number of the prisoners know that they have right to a legal assistance by expert (lawyer), employed in Penitentiary Ni. 43Providing legal assistance : System of providing legal assistance is organized in line with law, but there are certain lacks that can have significant consequences to legitimacy of disciplinary procedure. There is impression that officers in charge of giving legal assistance are capable of giving it but their number is too small in comparison to large pris on population, they are loaded with other daily duties that they regularly perform. This most probably leads to insufficient interest among the prisoners regarding the accomplishment of this very important right during their stay in Penitentiary. Innovation in giving legal assistance (03.2008.) is that Penitentiary lawyer is on duty, once a week, in one of the dormitories and gives oral advice or draws up written submissions for the prisoners. Insufficient number of employees on these duties ca n be seen in the fact that one person is a deputy in Disciplinary Commission, and at the same tome he gives legal advice to prisoners, which brings to factual and involuntary conflict of interests. no matter the fact that in cases, when involved in Disciplinary Commission work, he or she can avoid giving legal advice to a prisoner against whom the procedure is conducted. It may turn out to be useful to remind of sta tistical data that show that almost in 100% of the cases, the person against whom the disciplin ary procedure was conducted were declared guilty. Team members took insight in number of ra ndom selected disciplinary procedures that were conducted against prisoners in last year. Main aim of taking insight in these matters is determination of eventual lacks in a part that is related to giving legal assistance to prisoners by Penitentiary Service in charge. According to Team Members' opinion the only lack noticed during that insight lays in the fact that the way of keeping record in disciplinary procedure is not precise enough, bearing in mind that there is a form already in which the data is manually written in. Lack of legal procedure conducting in this way is reflected in the fact that only in one of the procedures, in which the team had insight, it was precisely written in that the person against whom the procedure is conducted is not interested for offered legal assistance and/or eventual engagement of a lawyer out of Penitentiary. In the remaining part, these procedures satisfy certain legal standards. 3.1.5. The following evidence is kept in line w ith the Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions: a) Record book b) Alphabetical registry c) Personal paper d) Card Registry of the Prisoners in Penitentiary e) Supporting evidence Book on number of persons who service prison sentence Sentence expiration journal Book of passers by Book of made escapes Book of disciplinary penalties Disciplinary notification Book on medical inspections Medical file Book on control and quality of food 44 Book of injuries at work Book of requests and complaints Book of submissions that prisoners submit to other organs and that are time-bounded Book of records on confiscated things Book of confiscated things Card of prisoner's personal possessions that are with him Book of use of continual vaca tion outside the Penitentiary Book of giving assistance in the institution Book of assistance given by other organs Book of persons released on probation Book of done by-passing in the Penitentiary Book of other changes during sentence serving Employment card Evidence card on parcels and visits Card of entrusted prisoners' equipment Card of financial deposit Evidence on sport activities Book of evidence about educative work Book on visits to prisoners in solitary confinement and isolation Evidence on cultural and educational work. Team from the Center has taken insight in a number of evidence, which is not sufficiently detailed and systematic, due to the lack of time, so that we could comment them here. We had insight in imprisonment eviden ce by which the following categories are comprised: -Register books represent main comprehensive way of keeping evidence of all most important data on every person that services the sentence in Penitentiary. Besides personal data about the prisoners they also comprise the data about the sentence upon which the prisoner was sent to sentence serving, about the time and way of ad mission in Penitentiary, anticipated/expected moment of sentence completion with adequate am endments as well as information whether it is remand prisoner. - Alphabetical register is a kind of evidence that practically represents shorter version of Register book in sense that only few key data related to prisoners stay in Penitentiary are written in Register. - Special evidence of prisoners who escaped, m oved off Penitentiary or died during sentence serving, is kept. - The evidence of number of prisoners is also kept. It is in form of book of daily number of prisoners as well as evidence of prisoners that are engaged at work, -Besides these kinds of evidence th at has been kept in the same wa y for several decades, there is evidence in e-form that is used almost every day. Prisoners with whom we talked know what is considered to be an incident among the prisoners, but they don't know whether the evidence of every incident is kept and in what way. Most common incidents recognized by interv iewed prisoners are fights and quarrels among prisoners, physical injuring and similar, bearing in mind that they don't know that keeping evidence of each of these incidents is mandatory. On the other hand they are familiar with the 45obligation of Medical Service to keep evidence of medical check-up if the prisoner addresses the doctor immediately after the incident. 3.1.6. Prisoners can require change of accommodati on for security and family reasons, i.e. brothers can be together. Those incapable of working are separated in a special department. All interviewees know who decides upon the change of accommodation but they are doubtful in respect of equal criteria based on wh ich the accommodation is changed or regarding the criteria for the advancement through categories. Out of that it comes that general conclusion is that change of accommodation is one of main potential resources for corruption spreading in Penitentiary. Prisoners unwillingly talk about the cases of sexual abuse although a small number of them said that they had heard of it. Based on prisoners' statements, allegedly only one case of sexual abuse happened, in the time of rebel. 46 3.2. Selection of Articles of EPR and Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions related to Chapter PROTECTION MEASURES * European Prison Rules ** Commentary to Recommendation Rec (2006) 2 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the European Prison Rules *** Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions Informing the persons deprived of liberty 30.1 At admission, and as often as necessary afterwards all prisoners shall be informed in writing and orally in a language they unders tand of the regulations governing prison discipline and of their rights and duties in prison. 30.2 Prisoners shall be allowed to keep in thei r possession a written version of the information they are given. 30.3 Prisoners shall be informed about any legal proceedings in which they are involved and, if they are sentenced, the time to be served and the possibilities of early release. ** Rule 30 This Rule underlines the importance of inform ing prisoners in a language which they can understand of their rights and duties. Steps also need to be taken to ensure that they remain properly informed. Prisoners will not only be interested in the material and formal conditions of their detention but also in the progress of their case and, insofar as they are sentenced, in how much time has s till to be served and in their eligibility for early release. For this reason it is important that the prison administration keeps a file on these matters for prisoners to consult. For a better understanding of the treatment of prisoners their families should have access to th e rules and regulations that determine the treatment of their next of kin. 38.1 Special arrangements shall be made to meet the needs of prisoners who belong to ethnic or linguistic minorities. 38.2 As far as practicable the cultural practices of different groups shall be allowed to continue in prison. 38.3 47 Linguistic needs shall be met by using comp etent interpreters and by providing written material in the range of languages used in a particular prison. ** Rule 38 The increasingly diverse prison population of Europe means that a new Rule is required to ensure that particular attention is paid to the needs of ethnic and linguistic minorities. Rule 38 states this proposition in general terms. Prison staff need to be sensitised to the cultural practices of various groups in order to avoid misunderstandings. *** Article 60 At the admission in the Penitentiary, first of all the identity of the prisoner is confirmed, a medical check is done and medical file is opened. At the admission at the Penitentiary the prisone r is introduced with rights and obligations that he has during the service of the sentence. Text of this Law and enactment of House rul es in the Penitentiary are available to the prisoner all the time, during service of the sentence, in language which is in use, in line with the Law on official use of language and script. Illiterate prisoner, the one that cannot read or is deaf-mute, or does not know the language, will be introduced with rights and obligations or ally or with the help of the translator (interpreter) Inspection 92. Prisons shall be inspected regularly by a gove rnmental agency in order to assess whether they are administered in acco rdance with the requirements of national and international law, and the provisions of these rules . ** Rule 92 This Rule uses the neutral term \"governmental agency'. This agency can be part of one ministry, e.g. the Ministry of Justice or the Mi nistry of the Interior, or can be an agency under the control of more than one ministry. Th e essential point is that such an agency or inspectorate is established by, and re ports to, the highest authorities. The ways in which governmental inspection is organised will vary from mere checking of the book keeping of prisons to in depth and on the spot audits, which take into account all aspects of prison administration a nd of the treatment of prisoners. What is important is that the results of these inspec tions are reported to the competent authorities and made accessible to other interested parties without undue delay. These rules do not specify how planning and control systems and audits should be organized, as this is for the governmental authorities to decide. 93.1 The conditions of detention and the treatment of prisoners shall be monitored by an independent body or bodies whose findings shall be made public. 93.2 Such independent monitoring body or bodies sh all be encouraged to co-operate with those international agencies that ar e legally entitled to visit prisons. 48** Rule 93 In the member-states of the Council of Europe different models of independent monitoring of conditions of imprisonment can be found. In some countries an ombudsman has powers in this respect; in other states this task is entrusted to judicial authorities, often combined with the power to receive and handle complaints of prisoners. This Rule does not intend to prescribe one single form of monitoring but underlines the need for a high quality of such independent supervision. This presupposes that these monitoring bodies are supported by a qualified staff and have access to independent experts. It is important that the findings of these bodi es, together with any observations that may have been submitted by the management of the prison concerned, are open to the public. Reports of the monitoring bodies may contain proposals and observations concerning existing or draft legislation. Independent monitoring bodies should be encour aged to forward copies of their reports and the responses of the governments concerne d to international bodies, authorised to monitor or inspect the prisons such as th e European Committee for the Prevention of Torture. This would assist these international bodies to plan their visits and allow them to keep their finger on the pulse of the nationa l penitentiary systems. Because of their limited financial resources and the increase of the number of states to be visited, international bodies must rely increasingly on communication with independent national monitoring bodies. In many penitentiary systems individual pr isons are being monitored in some way or another by boards of visitors, consisti ng of (professionally) interested volunteers recruited from the community. A common approa ch of these boards is that its members take turns to visit the prison, talk to prisone rs about their worries and complaints and, in most cases, try to mediate between the prison management and the prisoners to find solutions for perceived problems. Though it is self evident that the existence of local boards of visitors can be a guarantee for a more intensive and involved monitoring, in small countries with only a few prisons and a small prison population independent m onitoring by a national authority could be sufficient. *** Article 29 The work of Directorate is public. Minister in charge of justice and Director of Directorate, directly or via the Penitentiary Warden, inform the public about the executi on of sanctions, on condition that professional secrecy is not harmed and that the security and good order maintaining in the Penitentiary in which the sanction is executed are not endangered. More detailed regulations on professional secrecy and the way how it is preserved is brought by the Minister in charge of justice. Article 30 Individual and group visits in the Penitentiary can be allowed by the Director of Directorate. Special care will be given in order to enable th e visit of national and international institutions and associations that deal with the protecti on of human rights, representatives of media, scientific workers that deal with criminalit y researches, as well as students of adequate faculties. 49Director of Directorate can allow visitors to ha ve conversations with pr isoners or particular prisoner, with or without the presence of authorized officer. Article 270 The work of the Penitentiary is supervised by the Directorate, via authorized persons. The Directorate supervises implementation of the regulations and expert work in the execution of prison sanctions and especially: orga nization and work of the penitentiary, legal and adequate dealing with pr isoners, the process of prisoners' treatment, organization of prisoners' work, condition and implementation of the measures for securing good order and security, work of the security service, implem entation of health and hygiene measures, nutrition and clothes of the prisoners and their accommodation. For the supervision of expert work both scientific and expert institutions can be engaged. Article 278 With an aim to control the execution of pris on sanctions defined by this Law, National Parliament of the Republic of Serbia forms, at the proposal of the Board for justice and Directorate, a 5 members commission. Commission from the Paragraph 1 of this Article consists of the persons who know about the problems of prison sanctions execution but who are not employed in the Directorate. Commission is independent in its work and the Directorate is ob liged to provide the Commission with all necessary data important for its work. Commission has all the competences as an authorized person from Articles 270 and 271 of this Law. Commission from Paragraph 1 of this Article submits the report on the condition of prison sanctions execution defined by this law, for at least once a year and it submits it to the National Parliament of Serbia and the Minister in charge of Justice. Disciplinary procedures 57.2 National law shall determine: a. the acts or omissions by prisoners that constitute disciplinary offences; b. the procedures to be followed at disciplinary hearings; c. the types and duration of punishment that may be imposed; d. the authority competent to impose such punishment; and e. access to and the authority of the appellate process. **Rule 57 makes it clear that disciplinary offences should be precisely defined and procedures should respect the principles of justice and fa irness. This means that all prisons should have a set of regulations which clearly lists the acts or omissions that constitute a breach of prison discipline and that are liable to l ead to formal disciplinary action. Hence all prisoners should know in advance what are th e rules and regulations of the prison. The legal status of these regulations should be clear. In many countries they will require parliamentary approval. Rule 57.2 lists the elements that should be included in the regulations. 59. 50 Prisoners charged with disciplinary offences shall: b. be informed promptly, in a language whic h they understand and in detail, of the nature of the accusations against them; c. have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of their defence; d. be allowed to defend themselves in pers on or through legal assistance when the interests of justice so require; e. be allowed to request the attendance of w itnesses and to examine them or to have them examined on their behalf; and f. have the free assistance of an interpreter if they cannot understand or speak the language used at the hearing. **Rule 59 In line with this Rule any prisoner who is to be charged under a disciplinary proceeding has the right to know details of the charge in advance and should be given sufficient time to prepare a proper defence. In case a prisoner is held in isolation pending the hearing the procedure should not be delayed unjustifiably, namely due to internal or external investigation. In all cases the accused prisoner should be present at the hearing of the case. The CPT has endorsed several of the elements of Rule 59 in a number of its reports (for example, CPT/Inf (2003) 1 Report to the Government of Cyprus on the visit to Cyprus carried out by the European Committee for th e Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) from 22 to 30 May 2000. Strasbourg, 15 January 2003; CPT/Inf (2001)27 Report to the Latvian Government on the visit to Latvia carried out by the European Committee for th e Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) from 24 January to 3 February 1999. Strasbourg, 22 November 2001; CPT/Inf (2002) 16 Report to the Maltese Government on the visit to Malta carried out by the Eur opean Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) from 13 to 18 May 2001. Strasbourg, 27 August 2002). The right of an accused prisoner to have legal representation when facing a serious charge has been confirmed by the European Court of Human Rights (Case of Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom: Applica tion numbers 39665/98 and 40086/98). 60.1 Any punishment imposed after conviction of a disciplinary offence shall be in accordance with national law. 60.2 The severity of any punishment shall be proportionate to the offence. 60.3 Collective punishments and corporal punishment, punishment by placing in a dark cell, and all other forms of inhuman or degr ading punishment shall be prohibited. 60.4 Punishment shall not include a total prohibition on family contact. 60.5 Solitary confinement shall be imposed as a punishment only in exceptional cases and for a specified period of time, which shall be as short as possible. 60.6 Instruments of restraint shall never be applied as a punishment. ** Rule 60 This Rule implies that the clearly define d and published list of disciplinary offences should be accompanied by a complete list of punishments which may be imposed on any 51prisoner who commits one of these offences. These punishments should always be just and proportionate to the offence committed. The list of punishments should be set down in a legal act approved by the appropriate authority. Staff shall not have a separate informal system of punishments that bypasses the official procedures. In the case of Ezeh and Connors mentioned above the European Court of Human Rights found that the right of prison governors in E ngland and Wales to add up to 42 days to the time a prisoner spent in prison was a breach of Article 6 (Right to a fair trial) of the European Convention on Human Rights. Punishments may include a formal recorded wa rning, exclusion from work, forfeiture of wages (where these are paid for prison work), restriction on involvement in recreational activities, restriction on use of certain pers onal possessions, restriction on movement in the prison. Restrictions on family contact but not a total prohibition, may also be used as a punishment. Such punishment should be used only where the offen ce relates to such family contacts or staff are assaulted in the context of a visit. All disciplinary hearings should be conducted on an individual basis. If, for example, there has been a mass refusal to obey a rule or an assault involving a number of prisoners, the case of each must be heard and punishments imposed on an individual basis. There are specific prohibitions against all forms of corporal punishment, punishment by placing in a dark cell, and all other inhuman or degrading punishments. The European Court of Human Rights has found that shaving the head of a prisoner as a disciplinary measure is a breach of Article 3 (Prohibition of torture) of the European Convention on Human Rights (Case of Yankov v. Bulgaria: Application number 39084/97). It is now widely held that a reduction of diet is a form of corporal punishment and constitutes inhuman treatment; this reflects professional opini on that has developed in recent years. Solitary confinement, mentioned in Rule 60.5, refers to all forms of removing prisoners from association with other prisoners by placing them alone in a cell or a room. It should not be considered an appropriate punishment other than in most exceptional circumstances. This Rule is confirmed by Principle 7 of the United Nations Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners. There are various forms of solitary confinement. The most extreme occurs when an individual is held entirely on his or her own and is subject to sensory deprivation by lack of access to light, sound or fresh air in what are often called \u2014dark cells\". This form of isolation should never be imposed as a punishment. Another form of solitary confinem ent occurs when a prisoner is held in a single cell with access to normal light and air and can hear prisoners moving in adjacent areas. This type of punishment should onl y be used in exceptional circumstances for short periods of time. During this period, pr ison staff shall make regular and reasonably frequent contact with these prisoners. (See the commentary on Rule 42). The CPT pays particular attention to the use of solitary confinement, or any conditions similar to it. It has noted that \u2014Solitary confinement can, in certain circumstances, amount to inhuman and degrading treatment; in any event, all forms of solitary confinement should be as short as possible\" (CPT, 2General Report on the CPT's Activities, para 56). It must be stressed that the requirement of one hour of daily outdoor exercise for prisoners (Rule 27.1) applies equally to in mates placed in solitary confinement as a punishment. Such prisoners should also be provided with reading material. The same applies to prisoners under special high security (Rule 53). Rule 60.6 relates to the use of instruments of restraint as means of security or to prevent injury. These must never be used as a form of punishment. Instruments of restraint may include handcuffs, chains, irons, straitjackets and any form of electronic control of the person. 52*** Article 144 Disciplinary offences are serious and light viol ations of good order and security rules as well as violations of other rules of prisoner's beha vior defined by this Law and enactment of House rules in the Penitentiary. More serious disciplinary offences are defined by this Law and lighter ones by the enactment of House rules in the Penitentiary. The prisoner is the subject of disciplinary measure as well, if during the service of the sentence he commits a felony fo r which the following are laid down: fine, prison sentence up to one year or prison sentence up to one year and fine. The prisoner cannot be a subject of disciplin ary measure for several times for the same disciplinary offence act. Article145. Serious offences are: 1) Escape or attempt of the escape from the Penitentiary 2) Rebel or escape abetment; 3) Preparation of rebel or abetment; 4) Unauthorized leaving of prison; 5) Violence towards other person; 6) Making, possession or use of dangerous matters; 7) Making or bringing into the Penitentiary means adequate for the attack, escape or felony; 8) Obstructing officers or a person who is author ized to be in the prison or to enter it to access in any part of the Penitentiary. 9) Menace, damage or destruction of the property, in greater amount; 10) Refusal to execute officers' lawful orde r due to which appear or could have appeared more serious harmful effect; 11) Jeopardizing other person's health delib erately or by being harsh careless; 12) Production, possession or use of opiate or psychoactive substances; 13) Harsh negligence of personal hygiene; 14) Playing hazardous games; 15) Deliberate personal health jeopardizing in order to disable oneself for performing duties; 16) Giving resistance to medical check-up or measures for preventing danger of disease; 17) Abetment of a person deprived of libe rty to commit more serious disciplinary offence; 18) Negligence of work duty that caused or c ould have caused serious harmful effect; 5319) Training oneself or other person about the way of committing felony based on personal or other people's experience; 20) Serious abuse of acquired special rights from Article 115, Paragraph 1 of this Law; 21) Repeating lighter disciplinary offences. Article 146 Disciplinary measures are declared for disciplinary offences. Disciplinary measures are: 1) reproof; 2) restriction or ban on receiving parcels for the period up to three months; 3) withdrawal of granted special rights fr om Article 115, Paragraph 1 of this Law; 4) restriction or ban on money handling in th e Penitentiary in the period of up to three months; 5) Sending to a solitary confinement in free time or during the whole day or night. Measure of sending to a solitary confinement a nd restriction or ban on money handling in the Penitentiary can be declared only for serious disciplinary offences. Withdrawal of granted special rights from Article 115, Paragraph 1 sending to a solitary confinement can be declared cumulatively. Article 158 Prisoner against whom disciplinary procedure is led is obligatorily heard and his statements are checked and other pieces of evidence are produced as well. Record on the course of disciplinary procedure is made. Article 161 Prisoner against whom disciplinary procedure is led has a right to expert legal aid. The prisoner must be informed of the right fro m the Paragraph 1 of this Article before the establishment of the facts in the procedure. Article 162 Disciplinary procedure is finalized by the decision. Prisoner can lodge a complaint against the decision within three days from the receiving of the decision and the complaint must be decided upon within three days. The complaint does not delay th e execution of the decision. Director of Directorate decides upon the complaint. . 54 Complaints procedures 70.1 Prisoners, individually or as a group, shall ha ve ample opportunity to make requests or complaints to the director of the prison or to any other competent authority. 70.2 If mediation seems appropriate this should be tried first. 70.3 If a request is denied or a complaint is rej ected, reasons shall be provided to the prisoner and the prisoner shall have the right to appeal to an independent authority. 70.4 Prisoners shall not be punished because of havi ng made a request or lodged a complaint. 70.5 The competent authority shall take into acc ount any written complaints from relatives of a prisoner when they have reason to believe th at a prisoner's rights have been violated. 70.6 No complaint by a legal representative or organisation concerned with the welfare of prisoners may be brought on behalf of a pris oner if the prisoner concerned does not consent to it being brought. 70.7 Prisoners are entitled to seek legal advice about complaints and appeals procedures and to legal assistance when the in terests of justice require. ** Rule 70 This Rule makes a distinction between making requests and lodging complaints. Prisoners must have ample opportunity to make requests and must have avenues of complaint open to them both within and out side the prison system. The prison authorities shall not obstruct or punish the making of requ ests or complaints but shall facilitate the effective exercise of the rights embedded in this rule. This does not preclude the introduction of legal mechanisms to deal summarily with minor issues. Requests of prisoners concern favours or facilities that they are not entitled to by right, but which may be granted by the prison mana gement or other competent authorities. For instance, in some penitentiary systems extr a visits may be allowed, though prisoners have no right to them. The same applies to requests for permission to leave the prison to attend the funeral of a relative and requests fo r transfer to a specific prison or prison unit. In most cases the director will be entitled to decide, but in some jurisdictions specific requests can only be granted by judicial aut horities or must be decided at ministerial level. Complaints are formal objections against decisions, actions or lack of action of the prison administration or other competent authorities. In some jurisdictions the appropriate penitentiary remedy is called an \"objection' or an \"appeal'. The term appeal in this Rule however is reserved for legal action against a denial of a request or the rejection of a complaint. Provision may also be made for specialised complaints procedures. Ideally, national law should allow prisoners also to complain against decisions, conduct or inactivity of medical personnel to existing national medical disciplinary bodies. This Rule does not require that requests or complaints should be submitted in writing. Given the illiteracy of quite a number of pris oners, a prisoner should be able to ask to meet the civil servant or the competent agen cy in order to transmit the request or the complaint orally (CPT/Inf (96) 18 Visit in Slovenia in 1995), and the authorities have 55the obligation to put it in a written form. The competent authorities should deal promptly with requests and complaints and should accompany this with reasons making it clear wh ether action will be taken and if so, what action. This also applies to requests or complaints from prisoners' relatives or organisations referred to in Rule 70.6. Complaints can lead to antagonistic attitudes of the parties involved, which can harm the relations between prisoners and staff. Therefor e it seems sensible to try mediation first. This calls for a mediation mechanism to be in serted in the penitentiary legislation. This task could be entrusted for example to a me mber of a local supervisory committee or a judicial authority. If the conflict cannot be resolved by mediation, the prisoner must still have the right to lodge a formal complaint. National law can state that complaints about trivial matters can be d eclared inadmissible. The requests are submitted to the prison administration or another authority empowered to decide on the matter. Prisone rs must have the opportunity to convey complaints to any authority inspecting or supervising the pris on regardless of previous or simultaneous complaints. When this authority is not em powered to handle the complaint itself it should send it on to the competent body. Complainants shall be allowed to comm unicate on a confidential basis with the independent authorities entrusted with the hand ling of complaints and appeals. Decisions of these authorities shall be made accessible to prisoners. Requests and complaints should be registered for the benefit of the prison administration itself and for inspection by visiting bodies. (CPT/Inf (2002) 1 -Visit to Bulgaria in 1999 and CPT/Inf (2001) 20 Visit to The Fo rmer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 1998).Analysis of the substance of requests and complaints can contribute to a better management of the institution. The right to make requests and complaints is primarily granted to prisoners but national law may allow third parties to act on behalf of a prisoner, for instance when a prisoner's mental or physical condition prevents him from acting himself and he does not have a lawyer to act on his behalf. Relatives of a prisoner are entitled to complain where the prisoner's rights may be infringed while organisa tions that have the interests of prisoners at heart may also be allowed by the director to bring such complaints. However, Rule 70.6.allows the prisoner to oppose the co mplaint being made in this way. When, after an internal appeal has failed, a complaint is successfully made to an independent authority complainants must have confidence that the decision of that authority will be executed fully and promptly by the prison administration. To ensure an effective exercise of the right to lodge complaints forms, stationery and, if necessary, stamps should be provided to pris oners. The complaint forms should be freely available to prisoners at some specified place (e.g. the library), thereby avoiding a prisoner having to ask for them specifically. A system of transmission should be devised that avoids prisoners having to hand the c onfidential access envelope to prison staff. (CPT/Inf (91) 15 visit to the United Kingdom: England/Wales 1990). Confidential communication with national and in ternational bodies authorized to receive complaints is essential. This Rule does not a ttempt to prescribe an exclusive model of a complaints procedure but sets out the basic requirements such procedures should comply with lest they be considered to represent e ffective remedies in terms of art. 13 of the ECHR (see: Van der Ven v. The Netherla nds (appl. nr. 50901/99 04/02/2003)). What is important is that the complaint procedure ends with a final binding decision taken by an independent authority. The member states are free to designate the independent authority that has the power to handle complaints. This can be an ombudsman or a judge (e nforcement magistrate or executing or 56supervisory judge), supervising prosecutor, court, or a Public Defender (CPT/Inf (2002) 14 Visit to Georgia in 2001). Authorities involved in handling complaints should exchange views and experiences on a regular basis, the aim being to harmoni se as far as possible their practice. (CPT/Inf (96) 9 visit to Spain 1991). *** Article 114 Prisoner has a right to lodge a complaint to the Pe nitentiary Warden for the breach of right or other irregularities done to him. Penitentiary Warden, or a person authorized for that by him, is obliged to carefully examine the complaint and bring a decision about it, within 15 days. The prisoner who does not get the answer to a complaint or who is not satisfied with the decision has right to submit an appeal to a Direct or of Directorate, who is obliged to decide upon it within 15 days from the appeal receiving. Prisoner has a right to, without the presence of employed and appointed persons in the Penitentiary, complain to an authorized pers on who supervises the work of the Penitentiary. The contents of the complaint and appeal represent a secret. Registers *** Article 10 Adequate evidence of the persons on which sanc tions and restraint are executed is kept. More detailed regulations on evidence are brought by the Minister in charge of justice. Note: THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS RE LATED TO THE EVIDENCE OF ALL THE INCIDENTS AMONG THE PRISONERS IN THE PENITENTIARY FOR THE EXECUTION OF PRISON SANCTIONS. Provisions that regulate this are given in the bylaw on House rules. Evidence of these incidents is kept indirectly through disciplinary measures, when the disciplinary procedure is started because of the incidents among the prisoners. Separation of categories of detainees 4. Prison conditions that infringe prisoners' human rights are not justified by lack of resources. **Rule 4 It sometimes happens that governments are accused of treating their prisoners better than other members of society. Alt hough this accusation is rarely true in practice, Rule 4 is designed to make it clear that the lack of resources cannot justify a member state allowing prison c onditions to develop that infringe the human rights of prisoners. Nor are policie s and practices that routinely allow such infringements acceptable. 57 *** Article 37 The prisoner is allocated to a service of a se ntence pursuant to allocation enactment of the Minister in charge of justice. Exclusively, based on prisoner's request, Director of Directorate can, for justified reasons, departure from the allocation enactment and ch ange the place of service of a sentence. Article 66 Prisoner has a right to accommodation that fulfills contemporary hygi enic conditions and local climate conditions. Classification of a prisoner in the premises for collective stay and dormitories will be conducted with careful estimation of all the circ umstances and data for which the evidence is made in the Admission Service, especially bearing in mind age, personal nature and tendency, as well as other characteristics upon which positive mutual influence and lack of danger of mutual physical and mental menace depend. Disabled prisoner has a right to accommodation compa tible to type and level of his disability. 58 4.Regime and activities 4.1. 4.1.1. Contacts with the outside world (letter writing : is there a mail censorship, what a re the criteria for censorship and are they recognized by the prisoners, what are the conditions for package receiving; communication with family and other persons : how often are visits allowed, what is the duration of visits, are there any limitations of visits for some catgories of prisoners and on which baisis, in what way are fa milies admitted, what are the matirial conditions of visits, what is the level of visits monitoring, are there any social measures provided regarding persons who have never had any visits; access to other forms of communication: newspapers, TV, are there any limitations, based on which criteria) 4.1.2. Education 4.1.3. Outdoor exercise 4.1.4. Leasure activities 4.1.5. Religion 4.1.6. Work 4.2. Selection of Articles of EPR and Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions related to Chapter 59 4.1.1. The prisoners are aware of the fact that the letters can be sent on daily basis. They hand over an open mail in order to be checked if there is anything else except for th e written paper. This is something the prisoners are informed about. All of the interviewed are aware of the fact that the letters are read before being sent (the ones at the admission period or at the beginning of their servitude are not informed about that). One of the interviewed prisoners states out from his own experience that the treatment officer does not open nor read mail addressed to the ministry of law. They think that the mail control is done by the treatment officers but they don't know whether there are any criteria for censorship. They are informed about the conditions for r eceiving regular and external packages, received according to the category classification. Keeping family and other social relations is en abled according to the law. With the exception of one interviewed prisoner, all the others are we ll informed about the possibility of visits from the outside world. Certain number of prisoners had some extra family visits approved by the warden. They are informed about the duration of th e visits and limitations compared to the certain categories of prisoners. The searching of the visitors is performed due to the need. Depending on the type of the visit the executives walk around a little further away or they are in the next-door room. The families are not allowed to bring home made food. There is not recognized the need by the penite ntiary staff for some additional care (compared with the prisoners who have regular visits) for the prisoners being without any visits nor is recognized the reason for doing so. The access to the information from outside worl d is through TV and newspaper, it is free but without much variety and in insufficient number compared to the number of prisoners per newspaper. During the realization of our project the number of newspapers available to the prisoners has been increased from 24 to 108 (five times). 4.1.2. The instistution has not offered any possibility for education since the school was burnt in the year 2000 during the riots. At the same time the prisoners are interested in gaining additional education. A small number of interviewed prisoners h as an adequate motivation for education related to the objective insight into the type of education as well as to the latter applying of the knowledge gained. That is a good thing meaning that there is an insight of the prisoners into the connection between the education and the life of the higher quality during the servitude in the penitentiary as well as after release. Younger interviewed prisoners mainly show th e interest for education whereas the older ones are satisfied with the accomplished level expl aining it is too late for further education. The prisoners have access to the library by not simple enough procedure that will encourage them to reading and self learning. The functioning of the library is renovated but there is still dissatisfaction present among the interv iewed regarding the stack and waiting for the certain title. A certain number of the interviewed regularly take books for reading besides the additional ones they get from their hom es the selection being rather small. There are no (physical) conditions for cinema and theatre performances which are part of the culture and indirectly the education. Multi-f unctional sport auditory would serve the need. 60 4.1.3. Outdoor activities All of the interviewed prisoners claim that th eir daily outdoor activities last less than an hour. At the same time, this period of time is actua lly more shorter due to the fact that is the only period of time for making telephone cal ls or shopping in the canteen. Therefore, the time they can spend for outdoor activities or staying in the fresh air is too short and insufficient and lasts for only 30-40 minutes. This is far beyond the standa rd and besides it has not been caused by the illegal act of the officials it is a serious deficiency. The explanation for this deficiency can be seen in the fact that the Ni penitentiary, which has been functioning with upper limit capacity re garding the number of employees and available accomodation abilities, is additionaly loaded with about a nuhdred prisoners transfered from the penitentiary in Sremska Mitrovica. The add itional difficulties arouse due to the still present consequences of the riots as well as the utte red hostility between imprisoned groups located in different dormitories. This kind of treatment of the prisoners is the potential producer of dissatistaction and together with always popular aspects of amn esty represent the potential risk for escalation of dissatisfaction and is certainly not the way for prevention of violent acts. Something that is considered to be a prevention may become a cause. Exercise and recreation Exercise and recreation leads to sublimation of negative energy, enables the qualitative configuring of the leisure time, enables keeping th e adequate level of health of people living in these specific conditions, enables making good inte rpersonal relations (making them able to distance themselves from the authority of informal groups and leaders), the failure tolerance is developed and according to that the persiste ncy in accomplishing the determined aim is strengthen. The prisoners are able to do exercises an hour a day at the gym or outside in the open air where the courses for group sports are situated. Currently existing outdoor courts are not ade quate to the number of the prisoners and at the Supervision department they are not big enough. The former workshops are adapted and turned into a small sport hall (April, 2008) where the prisoners will be able to do exercises in groups of 50 (for safety reasons) two to three hours a day aside from the time period provided for a walk. 4.1.4. At the beginning of the project (July, 2007) there were no leasure activities. Later on (October, 2007) the art (engraving) and painting courses started. At the moment the music section is being prepared (April, 2008). The interviewed prisoners give interesti ng ideas about possible hobbies they can take up and which can be conveyed by purchasing co mputers and accompanying equipment (hardware and software), which enables music composing and open other possibilities of multimedia which depends on and stimulates as well th e creativity of the prisoners. One of the interviewed would like to take up a dover hobby. 61 The prisoners' participation: The prisoners has been recently (04/08) re-i nvolved in the functioning of the penitentiary in terms of dealing with everyday problems enabling them to advance through the following system: ``The winged conference`` is a starting point - the basis for the participation of the prisoners within a treatment group. The winged conference is assembled by the group treatment officer. All prisoners besides the treatment officer and the Head of the department participate at the conference. ``The winged council``: The prisoners make suggestions regarding the candidates for the president of the winged council, the secretary an d 9 members of the council. The members (the representatives of the prisoners) representing their interests in communication with the penitentiary authorities are elected by the prisoners. . Commissions: On the basis of the treatment group - wi ng, the 3 members of the commissions are elected from the prisoners' order. The commission for discipline and human relations The commission for the hygiene and the protection of the environment The commission for supplying, nutrition and the function of the canteen The commission for culture and recreation The Department council: After the election of the entities and self par ticipating organs per wings, the automatic representatives of the dormitory council are : The president of the Winged council The president of the commission for discipline and human relations The president of the commission for supplying, nutrition and the function of the canteen The Department council deals with the issues and the problems regarding the department. The penitentiary community assembly is the highest self participating entity of the prisoners. It is consisted of the 2 wing representa tives - from the treatment groups. The bodies are: - The President - The Vicepresident - The executive committee (4 members) and commissions : The commission for discipline and human relations The commission for the hygiene and the protection of the environment The commission for supplying, nutrition and the function of the canteen The functioning of the commissions is coordinated by the organizer of the cultural- entertaining and recreational activities who assembl es certain commissions according to the need and valuation of the members of the commissions so as to deal with certain problems and the improvement of the life quality at the penite ntiary. The commissions submit a report to the executive committee about their work. The executive committee submits the compiled report about their work and the work of the commissi ons to the Assembly being assembled at least 2 times a year, being more frequent if it is needed. 62 The original reports about the work of the winged council, the winged department council, the commissions and the penitentiary co mmunity assembly are submitted to the warden of the penitentiary. 4.1.5. The ortodox church has been renovated whereas other religious entities do not exist. Generally, the religios ceremoni es of other faith can be performed. The interviewed prisoners who belongs to some of generally accepted religious communities in Serbia (orthodox, catholic and Is lamic faith) make no complaints on respecting their religious rights regarding the fact that those religious rights, except for the occasional fasting, are not followed. On the other hand on e of the interviewed, the member of a small religious community (an Adventist) states that due to his faith he is not only often exposed to insults (\"sectarian\" and other) but also to physical violence by other prisoners that was the answer to the question about the bruise under his eye. Even if it is not clearly mentioned, the impression of the team member is that the prisoner is also of the opinion that some availabilities related to other prisoners are for him denied. The interviewed claim that the prisoners of ort hodox faith are able to have visits made by the priest but they are of the opinion that those visits must be more often and more usual. The interviewed prisoners of other relig ious faith did not give particular comments on the subject. It is praisefull to mention that the governance of the penitentiary has enabled for the prisoners of islamic faith to have meals between sunset and sunr is durig the fastive (2007.) which is not the time scheduled for meals. Those pris oners are enabled to make non-restrictive phone calls during Bairam. The impression of the members of the monitoring team is that the prisoners do not consider the availability of religious service as a pr iority. It is probably due to the life conditions imposing other priorities or it partially shows the attitude towards religion as not being in a daily political function. 4.1.6. Some of the interviewed prisoners are not in terested for any kind of work during their servitude whereas the ones who are interested stat e that there is not enough work for all. Actually there aren't any wo rking opportunities (in terms of sufficient number of available jobs) for which the interest is showed. There were 333 (October, 2007) employed prisoners in eight departments and two services. Besides, ther are not enough trained prisoners for the jobs being needed (they used to be trained in the pen itentiary). The work is on volontary basis and the salaries are from 1200 to 2000 dinars; at the th ird dormitory to 3000 dinars (the amounts are based upon the decision on prisoners' wage rate). The working hour is from 8:00 am to 3 pm. The prisoners who are employed as welders wo rk in extremely bad conditins. They don't have any safety equipment nor glasses for welding. Some of the prisoners state that the injuri es made at work are neglected. (The time The team members were unable to check those statemen ts due to the limited time of the project, the only thing we are certain of and that was being checked is that in the injuries record book which is the part of the medical service documentation the injuries made at work were also recorded). In spite of all that the prisoners agree to work even if the conditions are extremely bad in order not to loose their job and their salary even if it is being too small. 63Generally, the facilities/conveniences for the employeed are missing which would contribute to the idea of work being an occupationa l choice that should be made and that work is worth while compared to those unemployed. 64 Selection of Articles of EPR and Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions related to Chapter REGIME AND ACTIVITIES * European Prison Rules ** Commentary to Recommendation Rec (2006) 2 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the European Prison Rules *** Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions Contact with the outside world 24.1 Prisoners shall be allowed to communicate as often as possible by letter, telephone or other forms of communication with their fa milies, other persons and representatives of outside organisations and to r eceive visits from these persons. 24.2 Communication and visits may be subject to restrictions and monitoring necessary for the requirements of continuing criminal i nvestigations, maintenance of good order, safety and security, prevention of criminal offences and protection of victims of crime, but such restrictions, including specific restri ctions ordered by a judicial authority, shall nevertheless allow an acceptable minimum level of contact. 24.3 National law shall specify national and inte rnational bodies and officials with whom communication by prisoners shall not be restricted. 24.4 The arrangements for visits shall be such as to allow prisoners to maintain and develop family relationships in as normal a manner as possible. **Rule 24 Loss of liberty should not entail loss of contact with the outside world. On the contrary, all prisoners are entitled to some such cont act and prison authorities should strive to create the circumstances to allow them to maintain it as best as possible. Traditionally such contact has been by way of letters, te lephone calls and visits, but prison authorities should be alert to the fact that modern technology offers new ways of communicating electronically. As these develop, new techni ques of controlling them are emerging too and it may be possible to use them in ways that do not threaten safety or security. Contact with the outside world is vital for counteracting the potentially damaging effects of imprisonment (See further \u00a7\u00a7 22 and 23 of Rec (2003) 23 on the management by prison administrations of life-sentence and other long-term prisone rs.). Rule 99 makes it clear that untried prisoners should also be allowed to keep in contact with the outside 65world, and that restrictions, if any, on such contact should be particularly carefully limited. The reference to families should be interpreted liberally to include contact with a person with whom the prisoner has established a rela tionship comparable to that of a family member even if the relationship has not been formalised. Article 8 of the ECHR recognises that everyone has a right to respect for their private and family life and correspondence and Rule 24 can be read as setting out the duties that the prison authorities have to ensure that these rights are respected in the inherently restrictive conditions of the prison. This includes visits too, as they are a particularly important form of communication. To come within the limits set by Article 8.2 of the ECHR on interference with the exercise this right by a public authority, restrictions on communication should be kept to the minimum. At the same time Rule 24.2 recognises that communication of all kinds can be restricted and monitored for purposes of internal good order, safety and security of the prison (See the general discussion of th ese concepts in Part IV.) It may also be necessary to limit communication in order to meet the needs of continuing criminal investigations, to prevent the commission of further crime and protect victims of crime. Restrictions on these grounds should be imposed with particular caution, as they require decisions about matters often outside the knowledge of the normal operations of the prison authorities. It may be good policy to require court orders before making restrictions on these grounds. Monitoring too should be proportionate to the threat posed by a particular form of communication and should not be used as an indirect way of restricting of communication. Care should be taken to minimise particular difficulties and delays encountered by prisoners who n eed to communicate in a foreign language. The rules according to which restrictions ar e imposed are important too: they must be spelt out clearly, \u2014in accordance with law\" as required by Article 8.2 of the ECHR and not be left to the discretion of the prison administration. (See Labita v Italy appl. nr. 26772/95 06/04/2000). The restriction must the least intrusive justified by the threat. Thus, for example correspondence can be check ed to see that it does not contain illegal articles but needs only to be read if there is a specific indication that that its contents would be illegal. Visits, for example, should not be forbidden if they pose a threat to security but a proportionate increase in their s upervision should be applied. Moreover, in order to justify a restriction, the threat mu st be demonstrable; an indefinite period of censorship, for example is not acceptable. In practical terms the restrictions will vary depending on the type of communication invo lved. Letters, and with modern technology, telephone calls are easily checked. Electroni c communications such as emails still pose a higher security risk and may be limited to a small category of prisoners. The security risks may change and therefore the Rules do not lay down specific guidelines on this. An additional, a specific limit on restrictions is contained in Rule 24.2, which is intended to ensure that even prisoners who are subj ected to restrictions are still allowed some contact with the outside world. It may be good policy for national law to lay down a minimum number of visits, lette rs and telephone calls that mu st always be allowed. The reference to \u2014specific restrictions ordere d by a judicial authority\" in Rule 24.2 is designed to deal with the cases where additi onal restrictions that are necessary for the investigation which is being carried out ma y be imposed on remand prisoners. Even in these instances, however, they ma y not be totally isolated. Some types of communication may not be prohibited at all. Not surprisingly, the ECtHR has taken particular exception to attempts to limit correspondence with European Human Rights organs (See, for example, Campbell v United Kingdom appl. nr. 13590/88 25/03/1992.) and Rule 24.3 specifies that national law should lay down that such communication will be allowed as well as communication with, for example, a national 66ombudsman and the national courts. The particular significance of visits not only for prisoners but also for their families is emphasized in Rule 24.4. It is important that where possible intimate family visits should extend over a long period, 72 hours for example as is the case in many Eastern European countries. Such long visits allow inmates to have intimate relations with their partners. Shorter \u2014conjugal visits\" for this purpose can be demeaning to both partners. 24.10 Prisoners shall be allowed to keep themselve s informed regularly of public affairs by subscribing to and reading newspapers, periodicals and other publications and by listening to radio or television transmissions unless there is a specific prohibition for a specified period by a judicial au thority in an individual case. **Rule 24.10 deals with an aspect of contact w ith the outside world which is related to the ability to receive information, which is part of the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by article 10 of the ECHR. *** Article 75 The prisoner has a right to unlimited correspondence at his own expense. The contents of the letters are monitored in the closed-type Penitentiary with special security, closed-type Penitentiary and closed department of the Penitentiary. Correspondence can be withheld by the Penite ntiary Warden for the prisoner who services a sentence in the Penitentiary, from the Paragraph 2 of this Article, for security reasons, about which he informs the prisoner. The prisoner has right to complain against the decision of the Prison Governor from Paragraph 3 of this Article, The prisoner has a right to unmonitored corres pondence with his advocate, competent organs and international organizations for the protection of human rights. Article 76 The prisoner has a right to a phone conversation in line with the provisions of House rules enactment, at his own expense. For security reasons, prisoner's phone conversati ons can be supervised in the closed-type Penitentiary with special security, closed-type Penitentiary and closed department of the Penitentiary. Supervision of phone conversati on is ordered by a Penitentiary Warden and is done by the person appointed by him. Article 109 Prisoner has a right to use daily and periodical newspapers as well as other means of public informing. The prisoner can read books form the Peniten tiary library as well as books that he gets himself. Education 28.1 67 Every prison shall seek to provide all pris oners with access to educational programmes which are as comprehensive as possible and which meet their individual needs while taking into account their aspirations. 28.2 Priority shall be given to prisoners with lite racy and numeracy needs and those who lack basic or vocational education. 28.3 Particular attention shall be paid to the education of young prisoners and those with special needs. 28.4 Education shall have no less a status than wo rk within the prison regime and prisoners shall not be disadvantaged financially or otherwise by taking part in education. 28.5 Every institution shall have a library for the use of all prisoners, ad equately stocked with a wide range of both recreational and edu cational resources, books and other media. 28.6 Wherever possible, the prison library s hould be organised in co-operation with community library services. 28.7 As far as practicable, the education of prisoners shall: a. be integrated with the educational and vo cational training system of the country so that after their release they may contin ue their education and vocational training without difficulty; and b. take place under the auspices of external educational institutions . **Rule 28 This Rule makes general provision for the e ducation of all prisoners. Additional aspects of education for sentenced prisoners are considered in Rule 106. Prison authorities should pay special attention to the education of young prisoners and those with special educational needs such as prisoners of forei gn origin, disabled prisoners and others. This is in line with Recommendation N\u00b0 R (89) 12 of the Committee of Ministers on Education in Prison, which refers specifically to the education needs of all prisoners. The Rule emphasises the importance of the pris on authorities providing for prisoners who have particular educational needs and of inte grating the provision of education into the educational system in the community. It is also important that where prisoners obtain formal qualifications while in prison the cer tificates recording these qualifications should not indicate where they were obtained. The library should be seen as a facility for all prisoners and as an important recreational resource. It also has a key place in the provi sion of education in prison. The adequately stocked library should contain books in the various languages that prisoners read. It should also comprise legal materials includi ng copies of the European Prison Rules and similar instruments as well as the regulations applicable to the prison for prisoners to consult. Other materials that may be held in the library include electronically stored information. 6. All detention shall be managed so as to fac ilitate the reintegration into free society of persons who have been deprived of their liberty. **Rule 6 Rule 6 recognises that prisoners, both untried a nd sentenced, will eventually return to the community and that prison life has to be organised with this in mind. Prisoners have to 68be kept physically and mentally healthy a nd provided with opportunities to work and to educate themselves. Where it is known that pr isoners are going to serve long terms, these have to be carefully planned to minimise damaging effects and make the best possible use of their time. *** Article 110 Prisoner has a right to basic and high education, which are organized in the Penitentiary in line with general regulations. The Penitentiary organizes other types of prisoners' education, as well. Article 111 Penitentiary Warden can allow extr aordinary schooling to a prisoner. The expenses of extraordinary schooling are to be covered by the prisoner. Article 112 It must not be seen from the document on acquired education that the prisoner's education was acquired during the service of the sentence. Outdoor exercise 27.1 Every prisoner shall be provide d with the opportunity of at least one hour of exercise every day in the open air, if the weather permits. 27.2 When the weather is inclement alternative a rrangements shall be made to allow prisoners to exercise. 27.3 Properly organised activities to promote ph ysical fitness and provide for adequate exercise and recreational opportunities shall form an integral part of prison regimes. 27.4 Prison authorities shall facilitate such activiti es by providing appropriate installations and equipment. 27.5 Prison authorities shall make arrangements to organise special activities for those prisoners who need them. 27.6 Recreational opportunities, which include spor t, games, cultural activities, hobbies and other leisure pursuits, shall be provided and, as far as possible, prisoners shall be allowed to organise them. 27.7 Prisoners shall be allowed to associate with each other during exercise and in order to take part in recreational activities. **Rule 27 It is important to emphasise, as the place ment of Rule 27 does, that all prisoners, including those subject to disciplinary punish ment, need exercise and recreation although these activities should not be compulsory. Opportunities for exercise and recreation must 69be made available to all prisoners rather than only as part of a treatment and training programme for sentenced prisoners. This is in line with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, which deal with exercise and sport in Rule 24 of its general part. The importance of exercise for all prisoners is underlined by the CPT in its 2General Report [CPT/Inf (92) 3] para. 47. The one-hour a day period of physical exercise is a minimum that should be applied to all prisoners who do not get sufficient exercise through their work. Facilities for outdoor exercise should be sufficient to permit prisoners to exert themselves physically. Provision for physical exercise should be comp lemented by recreational opportunities to make prison life as normal as possible. The organisation of sport and recreation provide an ideal opportunity for involving prisoners in an important aspect of prison life and for developing their social and interpersonal skills . It is also an occasion on which prisoners can exercise their right of association. This ri ght is protected article 11 of the ECHR and, while it is severely limited in the prison contex t by the requirements of good order, it is not abolished entirely: see also the comment on Rule 52.3 in part IV. Rule 27.5. provides for prisoners who have a need for physical exercise of a specialised nature: for example, a prisoner who has been injured may require additional exercises to build up wasted muscles. 25.2 This regime shall allow all prisoners to sp end as many hours a day outside their cells as are necessary for an adequate level of human and social interaction. **Rule 25 underlines that the prison authoriti es should not concentrate only on specific rules, such as those relating to work, e ducation and exercise, but should review the overall prison regime of all prisoners to see that it meets basic requirements of human dignity. Such activities should cover the period of a normal working day. It is unacceptable to keep prisoners in their cells for 23 hours out of 24, for example. The CPT has emphasised that the aim shall be that the various activities undertaken by prisoners should take them out of their cells for at least eight hours a day [see CPT's 2nd General Report (CPT/Inf (92) para. 47].. Particular attention should be paid to ensure that prisoners that are not in work, such as prisoners who have passed the retirement age, are kept active in other ways. This Rule also makes specific reference to the welfare needs of prisoners and thereby provides the impulse for the prison authorities to see that the multiple welfare needs of prisoners are catered for, either by the prison service or welfare agencies within other parts of the state system. Specific reference is made to the need to provide support to prisoners, both male and female , who may have been physically, mentally or sexually abused. Note also that Rule 101 allows untried pr isoners to request access to the regimes for sentenced prisoners. *** Article 68 Prisoner has a right to spend at least two hours outdoor, in his free time. Prisoner, whose age and physical abilities allow it, has a right to perform, in his free time, organized physical activity, including right to use sport terrains, devices and equipment, together with other prisoners. . Leasure activities 70 27.6 Recreational opportunities, which include spor t, games, cultural activities, hobbies and other leisure pursuits, shall be provided and, as far as possible, prisoners shall be allowed to organise them. 27.7 Prisoners shall be allowed to associate with each other during exercise and in order to take part in recreational activities. **Rule 27 It is important to emphasise, as the place ment of Rule 27 does, that all prisoners, including those subject to disciplinary punishment, need exercise and recreation although these activities should not be compulsory. Opportunities for exercise and recreation must be made available to all pris oners rather than only as part of a treatment and training programme for sentenced prisoners . This is in line with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, which deal with exercise and sport in Rule 24 of its general part. The im portance of exercise for all prisoners is underlined by the CPT in its 2General Repor t [CPT/Inf (92)3] para. 47. The one-hour a day period of physical exercise is a minimum that should be applied to all prisoners who do not get sufficient exercise through their wo rk. Facilities for outdoor exercise should be sufficient to permit prisoners to exert themselves physically. Provision for physical exercise should be complemented by recreational opportunities to make prison life as normal as possible. The organisation of sport and recreation provide an ideal opportunity for involving prisoners in an important aspect of prison life and for developing their social and interpersonal skills . It is also an occasion on which prisoners can exercise their right of association. This ri ght is protected article 11 of the ECHR and, while it is severely limited in the prison cont ext by the requirements of good order, it is not abolished entirely: see also the comment on Rule 52.3 in part IV. Rule 27.5. provides for prisoners who have a need for physical exercise of a specialised nature: for example, a prisoner who has been injured may require additional exercises to build up wasted muscles. Religion 29.1 Prisoners' freedom of thought, conscien ce and religion shall be respected. 29.2 The prison regime shall be organised so far as is practicable to allow prisoners to practise their religion and follow their beliefs, to attend services or meetings led by approved representatives of such religion or beliefs, to receive visits in private from such representatives of their religion or beliefs and to have in their possession books or literature relating to their religion or beliefs. 29.3 Prisoners may not be compelled to practise a religion or belief, to attend religious services or meetings, to take part in relig ious practices or to accept a visit from a representative of any religion or belief. **Rule 29 Prison rules have hitherto regarded the pl ace of religion in prison as unproblematic and limited themselves to positive provision on how best to organise religious life in prison. However, the increase in some countries of prisoners with strong re ligious views requires a more principled approach as well as a positive requirement. 71Rule 29.1 seeks to recognise religious fr eedom as well as freedom of thought and conscience as required by article 9 of the ECHR. Rule 29.2 adds a positive requirement on prison authorities to assist in respect of religious observance as well as the observance of beliefs. There are various steps that should be taken in this regard. Rule 22 al ready requires that religious preferences be taken into account when prisoners' diets are determined. So far as is practicable, places of worship and assembly shall be provided at every prison for prisone rs of all religious denominations and persuasions. If a prison cont ains a sufficient number of prisoners of the same religion, an approved representative of that religion should be appointed. If the number of prisoners justifies it and conditions permit, such appointment should be on a full-time basis. Such approved representatives should be allowed to hold regular services and activities and to pay pastoral visits in priv ate to prisoners of their religion. Access to an approved representative of a religion should not be refused to any prisoner. Rule 29.3 provides safeguards to ensure that prisoners are not subject to pressure in the religious sphere. The fact that these matte rs are dealt with in the general section underlines the requirement that religious obser vance should not be seen primarily as part of a prison programme but as a matter of general concern to all prisoners. *** Article 113 Prisoner has a right to: 1) ordinance; 2) to keep and read religious literature; 3) to be visited by a representative of religion. If a Penitentiary contains a sufficient number of prisoners of the same religion, based on their request, the Penitentiary Warden will allow the representative of that religion to visit them regularly or to have regular service and lectures in the Penitentiary. The prisoner cannot be pressured to be present at ordinance or to be visited by the representative of the religion. Ordinance is held in a special, adequate room in the Penitentiary. Time, duration and way of using rights from this Article are more precisely defined by the enactment on House rules. Work 26.1 Prison work shall be approached as a positiv e element of the prison regime and shall never be used as a punishment. 26.2 Prison authorities shall strive to provid e sufficient work of a useful nature. 26.3 As far as possible, the work provided sha ll be such as will maintain or increase prisoners' ability to earn a living after release. 26.4 72 In conformity with Rule 13 there shall be no discrimination on the basis of gender in the type of work provided. 26.5 Work that encompasses vocational training shall be provided for prisone rs able to benefit from it and especially for young prisoners. 26.6 Prisoners may choose the type of employment in which they wish to participate, within the limits of what is available, proper vo cational selection and the requirements of good order and discipline. 26.7 The organisation and methods of work in the institutions shall resemble as closely as possible those of similar work in the community in order to prepare prisoners for the conditions of normal occupational life. 26.8 Although the pursuit of financial profit from indus tries in the institutions can be valuable in raising standards and improving the quality a nd relevance of training, the interests of the prisoners should not be subordinated to that purpose. 26.9 Work for prisoners shall be provided by the prison authorities, either on their own or in co-operation with private contractors, inside or outside prison. 26.10 In all instances there shall be equitable remuneration of the work of prisoners. 26.11 Prisoners shall be allowed to spend at least a part of their earnings on approved articles for their own use and to allocate a part of their earnings to their families. 26.12 Prisoners may be encouraged to save part of their earnings, which shall be handed over to them on release or be used for other approved purposes. 26.13 Health and safety precautions for prisoners sha ll protect them adequately and shall not be less rigorous than those that apply to workers outside. 26.14 Provision shall be made to indemnify pris oners against industrial injury, including occupational disease, on terms not less favourable than those extended by national law to workers outside. 26.15 The maximum daily and weekly working hour s of the prisoners shall be fixed in conformity with local rules or custom regulating the employment of free workers. 26.16 Prisoners shall have at least one rest day a week and sufficient time for education and other activities. 26.17 As far as possible, prisoners who work sha ll be included in national social security systems. ** Rule 26 Note that work by untried prisoners is dealt with in Rule 100 and work by convicted prisoners in Rule 105. The pos itioning of Rule 26 in th e general section represents a major departure from previous practice, for work has historically been conceived as something that is available to (and compulsory for) sentenced prisoners only. There is now widespread recognition that untried prisoners are entitled to work too. The 73provisions in Rule 26 apply to all types of wo rk performed by prisoners, whether they are untried prisoners who elect to do so or sen tenced prisoners who may be compelled to work. Rule 26.1 emphasises anew that no work perfo rmed by a prisoner should be punishment. This is designed to combat an obvious pote ntial abuse. Instead, the positive aspect should be emphasised. Work opportunities offered to prisoners should be relevant to contemporary working standards and techni ques and organised to function within modern management systems and production pr ocesses. It is important, as Rule 26.4 indicates in general terms, that women have access to employment of all kinds and are not limited to forms of work traditionally regarded as the province of women. Work should have a broadly developm ental function for all prisoners : the requirement that it should if possible enable them to incr ease their earning capac ity serves the same function. The principle of normalisation, inherent in Rule 5, underpins much of the detail on work in Rule 26. Thus, for example, provisions for health and safety, working hours and even involvement in national social security systems should mirror that for workers on the outside. This approach builds on that adopted by the Resolution N\u00b0 R (75) 25 of the Committee of Ministers on Prison Labour. The sa me approach should inform the level of remuneration for prisoners. All prisoners should ideally be pa id wages, which are related to those in society as a whole. Rule 26 also contains provisions designed to prevent the exploitation of prison labour. Thus Rule 26.8 is designed to ensure that the profit motive does not lead to the positive contribution that work is supposed to make toward the training of prisoners and the normalisation of their lives in prison being ignored. Rule 26.17 recognises that while work may form a key part of the daily routine of prisoners, it should not be required to the exclusion of other activities. Of these, education is specifically mentioned but contact with others, such as welfare agencies, for example, may be an essential part of the regime of a particular prisoner. *** Article 86. Prisoner capable of work has a right and obligation to work. Purpose of that work is that the prisoner acquires, maintain and increase his working capabilities, working habits and expert knowledge. Article 87 Prisoners' work has to be purposeful and must not be humiliating. Obtaining of material interest from prisoners ' work must not endamage the accomplishment of that work purpose. Article 88 Type of work is defined according to mental and physical abilities, professional qualifications, expressed preferences of the pr isoner and according to the potentials in the prison. Prisoners' mental and physical abilities for work are estimated by expert team of the Penitentiary. 74Article 89 The prisoner is employed in the Penite ntiary or out of the Penitentiary. Regime and way of work in the Penitentiary have to be as much similar as possible to the regime and way of work out of the Penitentiary. Market allowance for the work of the prisone rs out of the Penitentiary belongs to the Penitentiary. Article 90 Based on the request of the person who is for th e first time sentenced to a prison sentence for the period of six months, Director of Director ate can allow that, during the duration of the sentence, he can continue with the work he was employed at, in time of sentence order receipt, if there are justified reasons for that an d that the felony for which he is sentenced is not related to his work.. Article 91 Working hours of the prisoner can last up to 40 hours a week, and exclusively working hours can last longer, under the conditions defined by Law. Prisoner who attends lectures of general or skill education works proportionally shorter working hours. After working hours, the prisoner can be employed for maximum two hours a day, on maintaining hygiene and other ongoing works in the Penitentiary. Article 92 Prisoner's work is not included in years of working service. When, according to general rules, even time spent at work is recognized for acquiring professional qualifications, time spent on the same type of work during serving sentence is recognized for that qualification. Article 93 Prisoner has a right to remuneration for work which is paid once a month. Remuneration for work is at least 20 % of the lo west cost of labor in the Republic of Serbia, therewith the work longer than regular working hours is increased for 50%. Article 94 The Penitentiary Warden can award the prisone r in money for his work success. The highest amount of remuneration and aw ard is defined by the Director of Directorate. Article 95 The prisoner can freely handle 70% of remuneration and award for work, while the rest is left for his savings. The Penitentiary Warden can allow the prisone r to spend the means from his savings if the money is necessary for the prisoner or his family. Article 96 The prisoner enjoys occupational safety, according to general rules. The prisoner who is temporary disabled for work, not at his fault, has a right to remuneration, according to general rules. 75The Penitentiary covers most basic needs of the prisoner who does not work and who does not have his own means. Article 97 Prisoner has a right to a daily, weekly and annual vacation, according to general rules. Annual vacation is used in special premises of the Penitentiary. During annual vacation the prisoner receives remuneration as if he worked. Article 99 For deeds from the area of intellectual prope rty created during servicing the sentence, the prisoner has all the rights according to general rules. Article 100 More detailed provisions about the prisoner' s work and his rights based on work are systemized by a rule book, brought by th e Minister in charge of justice. 76 5. Medical services 5.1.1. Access to medical care (in what way they can gain access a) on their request, what is the procedure b) by medical staff c)by guard, what are their criteria; is there and practitioner available during day and night; procedure for urgent evacuation; in what way they can gain access to the psychologist/pcychiatrist) 5.1.2. Medical staff 5.2. Selection of Articles of EPR and Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions related to Chapter 77 5.1.1. The prisoners have access to the medical ser vice in any time on the request given to the security staff or the treatment officer who escort them to the medical ward to receive a medical care. The employers in medical service in the penite ntiary at Ni is open to 10 pm seven days a week. After 10 pm the prisoners are in the care of the emergency ward that is engaged on call. There is a certain established procedure for urgent medical evacuations during day and night. The medical service consists of a certain num ber of practitioners and medical technicians with a full time job in penitentiary at Ni, and medical consultants engaged according to the schedule. There is a weekly schedule according to wh ich the practitioners visit each of the dormitories. 5.1.2. See 7.1.4. 78 5.2.Selection of Articles of EPR and Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions related to Chapter MEDICAL SERVICES * European Prison Rules ** Commentary to Recommendation Rec (2006) 2 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the European Prison Rules *** Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions Access to medical care 40.3 Prisoners shall have access to the health services available in the country without discrimination on the grounds of their legal situation. ** Rule 40 The most effective way of implementing Rule 40 is that the national health authority should also be responsible for providing health care in prison, as is the case in a number of European countries. If this is not the cas e, then there should be the closest possible links between the prison health care providers and health service providers outside the prison. This will not only allow for a continuity of treatment but will also enable prisoners and staff to benefit from wider de velopments in treatments, in professional standards and in training. Recommendation N\u00b0 R (98) 7 of the Committee of Ministers requires that \u2014Health policy in custody should be integrated into, and compatible with, national health policy\". As well as being in the interest of prisoners, th is is in the interest of the health of the population at large, especially in respect of policies relating to infectious diseases that can spread from prisons to the wider community. The right of prisoners to have full access to th e health services available in the country at large is confirmed by Principle 9 of the UN Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners. The CPT's 3General Report also lays great emphasis on the right of prisoners to equivalence of health care. It is also an important principle that prisoners should have access to health care free of charge (Princip le 24 of the UN Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment). A number of countries experience great difficulty in providing healthcare of a high standard to the population at large. Even in these circumst ances prisoners are entitled to the best possible healthcare arrangements and without ch arge. The CPT has stated that even in times of grave economic difficulty nothing can relieve the State of its responsibility to 79provide the necessities of life to those whom it has deprived of liberty. It has made clear that the necessities of life include sufficien t and appropriate medical supplies. (See for example, Report on Moldova [CPT/Inf (2002) 11]). Nothing in these Rules prevents a state fro m allowing prisoners to consult their own doctor at their own expense. 41.2 Arrangements shall be made to ensure at all times that a qualified medical practitioner is available without delay in cases of urgency. **Rule 41 A basic requirement to ensure that prisone rs do have access to health care whenever required is that there should be a medical practitioner appointed to every prison. The medical practitioner referred to should be a fully qualified medical doctor. In large prisons a sufficient number of doctors should be appointed on a full-time basis. In any event a doctor should always be available to deal with urgent health matters. This requirement is confirmed in Recommenda tion N\u00b0 R (98) 7 of the Committee of Ministers. In addition to doctors, there should be othe r suitably qualified health care personnel. In some Eastern European countries para-med icals (sometimes called \u2014feldshers\") reporting to a doctor also deliver medical assi stance and care. Other important group will be properly trained nurses. In 1998 the Inte rnational Council of Nurses published a statement which says, among other things, that national nursing associations should provide access to confidential advice, c ounsel and support for prison nurses. [The Nurse's Role in the Care of Prisoners and Detainees, International Council of Nurses, 1998]. In dealing with prisoners, doctors should apply the same professional principles and standards that they would apply in working outside prisons. This principle was confirmed by the International Council of Prison Medical Services when it agreed the Oath of Athens: \u2014We, the health professionals who are worki ng in prison settings, m eeting in Athens on September 10, 1979, hereby pledge, in k eeping with the spirit of the Oath of Hippocrates, that we shall endeavour to prov ide the best possible health care for those who are incarcerated in prisons for whatever reasons, without prejudice and within our respective professional ethics\". This is also required by the first of the UN Principles of Medical Ethics relevant to the Role of Health Personnel, particularly Phys icians, in the Protection of Prisoners and Detainees against Torture and Other Crue l, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment *** Article 101 The prisoner enjoys free health care protection. The prisoner who cannot be given adequate health care protection is sent to a Special prison hospital or other medical institution, and pregna nt woman is sent to a maternity hospital, for child birth. Time spent on medical treatment is included in prison sentence. 80Article 102 Medical treatment of the prisone r is conducted on his approval. Forced feeding of the prisoner is not allowed. Exclusively, if by refusing medical treatment or food, the patient seriously endangers his health or life, certain medical measures define d by the doctor, according to general medical rules, will be implemented. Medical check-up of the prisoner is done only with the presence of one medical worker, unless medical worker requests different. The prisoner has right to be introduced with the findings about his medical condition and contents of medical file, except for the cases foreseen by general, medical rules. The prisoner must be enabled to use the services of a dentist. Article 103 Doctor in the Penitentiary is obliged to: 1) Give a medical check to each prisoner, right after the admission, after the return from temporary leave and before the release from the Penitentiary; 2) At admission to the Penitentiary or late r, whenever necessary, ascertain whether the prisoner got physically or mentally ill, as well as his working ability;; 3) Immediately give a medical check to a prisoner who complains that he is sick or there are signs that he is sick; 4) Give a daily medical check to a prisoner w ho is sick, refuses food or water, and to give a medical check to other prisoners in intervals not longer than three months; 5) Control accommodation, nutrition hygiene, san itary and other cond itions, upon which the health of the prisoners depends. 6) Keep special records on prisoners' injuries; 7) Supervise the work of the pharmacy and medi cal staff that keeps records, issues and distributes prescribed therapy to a prisoner. Doctor in the Penitentiary is obliged to: 1) Submit periodical reports on prisoners' medical condition; 2) Submit a report whenever determines that physical or mental condition of the prisoner is damaged or endangered due to the extension or the way of serving sentence and to recommend the measures for treatment of that person, including possibility of sentence serving discontinuity; 3) Gives findings and recommendations about quantity and quality of the food for prisoners; 4) Gives findings and recommendations for the improvement of hygiene in the Penitentiary and with the prisoners, a bout the state of sanitary conditions and installations, heating, lightening and ventila tion in the rooms where prisoners stay; 5) Gives findings and recommendations related to necessary physical activities of the prisoners. to the Penitentiary Warden, in written form. The Penitentiary Warden is obliged to, without delay, take up the measures from Paragraph 2 of this Article, recommended by a doctor. 81Article 104 Based on prisoner's request the Penitentiary Ward en can allow specialist medical check-up, if such medical check up was not prescribed by the doctor. The cost of medical check-up will be covered by the prisoner, if the Penitentiary Warden does not decide different. Article 105 The Penitentiary will immediately inform: a spouse, children, adoptees or a person with whom the prisoner lived until serving sentence, in matrimony or natural partnership or any other kind of permanent relationshi p, and if he does not have them , then his parents, adopters, brothers, sisters and other relatives, about his seri ously endangered health or life, his transfer to prison hospital or other medical institution. Medical staff 41.1 Every prison shall have the services of at l east one qualified general medical practitioner. 41.2 Arrangements shall be made to ensure at all times that a qualified medical practitioner is available without delay in cases of urgency. 41.3 Where prisons do not have a full-time medical practitioner, a part-time medical practitioner shall visit regularly. 41.4 Every prison shall have personnel su itably trained in health care. 41.5 The services of qualified dentists and opticians shall be available to every prisoner. **Rule 41 A basic requirement to ensure that prisone rs do have access to health care whenever required is that there should be a medical practitioner appointed to every prison. The medical practitioner referred to should be a fully qualified medical doctor. In large prisons a sufficient number of doctors shoul d be appointed on a full-time basis.

This is also required by the first of the UN Principles of Medical Ethics relevant to the Role of Health Personnel, particularly Phys icians, in the Protection of Prisoners and Detainees against Torture and Other Crue l, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 47.1 Specialised prisons or sections under medical control shall be available for the observation and treatment of prisoners suffering from mental disorder or abnormality who do not necessarily fall under the provisions of Rule 12. 47.2 The prison medical service shall provide for the psychiatric treatment of all prisoners who are in need of such treatment and pa y special attention to suicide prevention. **Rule 47 This Rule addresses mental health issues. The conditions of imprisonment may have a serious impact on the mental well-being of prisoners. Prison administrations should seek to reduce the extent of that impact and s hould also establish procedures to monitor its effects on individual prisoners. Steps should be taken to identify those prisoners who might be at risk of self-harm or suicide. Staff should be properly trained in recognising the indicators of potential self-harm. Where prisoners are diagnosed as mentally ill they should not be held in prison but should be tr ansferred to a suitably equipped psychiatric facility. In a judgment in April 2001 [Keenan v. United Kingdom (appl. nr. 27229/95 03/04/2001)] the European Court of Human Rights found a violation of Article 3 of the ECHR in the case of a prisoner who had committed suicide in respect of a lack of medical notes, a lack of psychiatric monito ring and segregation which was incompatible with the treatment of a mentally ill person. In its 3General report, the CPT stated that suicide prevention is a matter falling within the purview of a prisons' health care service. It should ensure that there is an adequa te awareness of this subject throughout the establishment, and that appropriate procedures are in place. Recommendation Rec(2004)10 of the Committee of Ministers to member states concerning the protection of the human rights and dignity of persons with mental disorder says in article 35 that persons with mental disorder should not be subject to discrimination in penal institutions. In partic ular, the principle of equivalence of care with that outside penal institutions should be respected with regard to their health care. They should be transferred between penal ins titution and hospital if their health needs so require. Appropriate therapeutic options shoul d be available for persons with mental disorder detained in penal institutions. Invol untary treatment for mental disorder should not take place in penal institutions except in hospital units or medical units suitable for the treatment of mental disorder. An inde pendent system should monitor the treatment and care of persons with mental disorder in penal institutions. *** Article 23 Health Care Service performs health preventi on, medically treats prisoners and detainees and supervises hygiene and food and water quality. 83Health Care Service has at least one doctor and one nurse, and must have at disposal services of a psychiatrist. When hospital treatment is organized in the Pen itentiary, the Penitentiary must have a doctor and hospital staff with appointed professional qua lifications and must ha ve adequate hospital premises, medical material, instruments, devices and drugs. Medical worker who does medical check-up and treats the prisoner is guaranteed and provided full professional independence, in line with law and ethical codex. 84 6. Material conditions 6.1. 6.1.1. Food (the quality, the quantity and the variety of food, who is responsible for the menu; the annual and daily budget/per prisoner; the special food for sick, old, religious; the ime of meals and intervals between/is it appropriate; are prisoners able to get food and drink between meals; are there any religious restriction; is there any shop; are families allowed to bring food; is food reg ularly inspected by the practitioner) 6.1.2. Lighting and ventilation; Sanitary facilities; Personal hygiene; Clothing and bedding (is there enough lighting for reading , can it be regulated by the prisonrs themselves; are they able to open the wi ndows; are there enough toilets and shower baths, what is their personal hygiene; a re there any sanitary facilities provided by the governance; how often the prisoners have access to the shower baths and is it different for employed and unemployed ones; how often is the bedding changed; is it possible for them to wash the clothes by themselves) 6.1.3. Overcrowding and accomodation (is there an adequate accomodation regar ding: the number of prisoners per square metre; do the prisoners spend more than 24 hours in the solitary confinement; ventilation and airing in closed rooms; have the prisoners access to the sanitary facilities) 6.2. Selection of Articles of EPR and Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions related to Chapter 856.1.1. All of the interviewed prisoners are genera lly satisfied with the quality, quantity and variety of meals. Some of them state that lunch and dinner are too early so that they usually are hungry during the night. Regarding the special nutriti on for particular category of prisoners, the interviewed are informed about the possibility of having these kinds of meals but they are of the opinion that the administrative procedure is too complicated. Taking into account the special nutrition regardi ng the religion some of the interviewed stated that this is actually possible whereas most of them are not informed about that possibility because they are not included within that special category. During the year 2007, the prisoners of Islamic faith were possible to have meals in accordance to their religion beliefs. The nutrition budget in 2007 (1 Euro - aprox. 80,00 diners) According to the law on budget of Republic of Serbia for the year 2007, for Administration for the Execution of Penitentiary Sanctions it was granted 46.000.000,00 diners out of which 20.825.000,00 diners were in plan from the centralized supplies and 27.175.000,00 diners from own supply means. This plan was carried out with certain varia tion, so that the total nutrition expenses for prisoners in 2007 were 42.405.025,00 diners: - from the centralized supplies 18.580.153,00 di ners (canned food, flour, rice, oil,...) - By own supply means 16.545.325,00 diners - By producing food using ow n economy 7.279.547,00 diners Two different menus are prepared: regular and diet-diabetic. The approximate nutrition value of the regular meals is 13 616 J, whereas of the di et-diabetic is 13 200 J. Th e prisoners have three meals a day. If it isn't possible to prepar e hot meals the prisoners have dry ones. 6.1.2. Taking into account the lighting of the room s, the interviewed prisoners disagree about whether the lighting is good enough or not, and it is possible that it depends of the dormitory where the prisoners are situated (detailed descr iption of buildings and rooms are given in the specific chapter). As far as ventilation is concer ned there is an impression of the possibility (to open the windows themselves) that also depends of the dormitory where the prisoners are situated. The interviewed prisoners are of the opinion that there isn't enough number of toilets and shower baths. They state that in the elderly ward there are two shower baths, two faucets and two toilets. The hygiene at the sanitary facilities is being kept by the prisoners themselves. The prisoners at Increased Supervision Department are able to take a shower once a week in groups. At A and B dormitories they can take a shower whenever they like but at dormitory C it depends on the accuracy of facilities (if there is enough pressure in the system). They use their own hygiene supplies, shampoo, shower cream a nd soap. The exceptional are those needy group of prisoners who are given hygiene supplies by the penitentiary. The answers regarding the possibility of using shower baths vary between once a week to possibility of taking a shower every day during the summer. The bedding used by the interviewed prisoners belongs to the penitentiary and it is changed in 15 days period. The bedding is washed in the laundry and is taken by the prisoners themselves. The clothes are washed by the prisone rs themselves and are dried on the wire during the summer and on the radiators during the winter. The prisoners state that they wear their own 86clothes besides uniforms. The prisoners themse lves buy the washing powder in the canteen. The penitentiary provides sanitary facilities for th e penitentiary rooms and buildings. 6.1.3. Besides the overall crowded capacity of the penitentiary the specific problem is a huge number of prisoners at the Increased Supervision Department. There are three and in some places four prisoners in consolitary confinement. An additional cause of jeopardizing the privacy and personal dignity of the prisoners at Increased Supervision Department are the toilets at the solitary confinement being without any doors or partition walls. It should be particularly taken into account the fact that there are prisoners at the Icread Supervision Department situated on their request in order to protect themselves from jeopardizing factors at other dormitories. In this regard it is obvious that there is a lack of accommodation capacity needed for distinguishing different categories of prisoners. The prisoners do not spend 24 hours or more indoors which complies with the national standards. The ventilation and amount of airing available indoors is adequate except for the Special Supervision department due to the factors previously mentioned. The hygiene and sanitary facilities are available but only to the prisoners responsible for that job. 876.2.Selection of Articles of EPR and Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions related to Chapter MATERIAL CONDITIONS * European Prison Rules ** Commentary to Recommendation Rec (2006) 2 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the European Prison Rules *** Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions Food 4. Prison conditions that infringe prisoners' human rights are not justified by lack of resources. ** Rule 4 It sometimes happens that governments are accu sed of treating their prisoners better than other members of society. Although this accusati on is rarely true in practice, Rule 4 is designed to make it clear that the lack of resources cannot justify a member state allowing prison conditions to develop that in fringe the human rights of prisoners. Nor are policies and practices that routinely a llow such infringements acceptable. 22.1 Prisoners shall be provided with a nutritious diet that takes into account their age, health, physical condition, religion, culture and the nature of their work. 22.2 The requirements of a nutritious diet, including its minimum energy and protein content, shall be prescribed in national law. 22.3 Food shall be prepared and served hygienically. 22.4 There shall be three meals a day with reasonable intervals between them. 22.5 Clean drinking water shall be available to prisoners at all times. 22.6 The medical practitioner or a qualified nurse shall order a change in diet for a particular prisoner when it is needed on medical grounds. **Rule 22 Ensuring that prisoners receive nutritious meals is an essential function of prison authorities. The change of the heading to \u2014nutrition\" from \u2014food\" reflects this change of emphasis. There is no prohibition of self- catering arrangements in the Rule, but where there are such arrangements they must be impl emented in a way that enables prisoners to have three meals daily. In some countries pr ison authorities allow prisoners to cook their own meals, as this enables them to a pproximate a positive aspect of life in the 88community. In such cases they provide pris oners with adequate cooking facilities and enough food to be able to meet their nutritional needs. Rule 22.2 now specifically obliges national authorities to embody the requirements for a nutritious diet in national law. These require ments would have to reflect the nutritional needs of different groups of prisoners. Once such specific standards are in place, internal inspection systems as well as national and in ternational oversight bodies will have a basis for determining whether the nutritional n eeds of prisoners are being met in the way that the law demands . *** Article 70 Prisoner has a right to nutrition adequate to ma intain his good health and stamina, to three meals a day whose energetic value must not be less than 12.500 J Prisoner who performs hard work, out patient s, pregnant women and women who have recently given birth, have right to nutrition specified by a doctor. The prisoner is provided nutrition, taking care of his religious beliefs, and according to the possibilities of the Penitentiary. Doctor or other professional checks up the qualit y of nutrition before delivery of meals and writes his findings in adequate book. Article 71 Fresh water must be accessible to a prisoner, at any time. Health properties of food and water in Penitentiarys are regularly monitored. Lighting and ventilation,... 18.1 The accommodation provided for prisoners, and in particular all sleeping accommodation, shall respect human dignity and, as far as possible, privacy, and meet the requirements of health and hygiene, due regard being paid to climatic conditions and especially to floor space, cubic content of air, lighting, heating and ventilation . 18.2 In all buildings where prisoners are requ ired to live, work or congregate: b. the windows shall be large enough to enable the prisoners to read or work by natural light in normal conditions and shall allow the entrance of fresh air except where there is an adequate air conditioning system; c. artificial light shall satisfy recognised technical standards; and d. there shall be an alarm system that enab les prisoners to contact the staff without delay. 18.3 Specific minimum requirements in respect of the matters referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be set in national law ** This Rule concerns accommodation. Develo pments in European human rights law have meant that rules about accommodation have to be strengthened. Conditions of accommodation collectively, and overcrowding in particular, can constitute inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and thus c ontravene Article 3 of the ECHR. This has now been fully recognised by the European Court of Human Rights in a number of decisions (See, for example, Kalashnikov v Russia (appl. nr. 47095/99 15/072002). Moreover, the authorities have to consider the special needs of prisoners: to 89accommodate a severely disabled person in pris on without providing additional facilities may amount to inhuman or degrading tr eatment (Price v United Kingdom -appl. nr. 33394/96 10/07/2001). Physical accommodation includes both space in cells and issues such as access to light and air. The importance of access to natural light and fresh air is reflected in the separate Rule 18.2 and underlined by the CPT in its 11th General Report [CPT/Inf (2001)16] at para. 30. Windows should not be covered or have opaque glass. It is recognized that in Northern Europe it may not always be possible to read or work by natural light in winter. Rule 18 includes some new elements. The first, in Rule 18.3, is intended to compel governments to declare by way of national law specific standards, which can be enforced. Such standards would have to meet wider considerations of human dignity as well as practical ones of health and hygiene. The CPT, by commenting on conditions and space available in prisons in various countries has begun to indicate some minimum standards. These are considered to be 4m2 for prisoners in shared accommodation and 6m2 for a prison cell. These minima are, related however, to wider analyses of specific prison systems, including studies of how much time prisoners actually spend in their cells. These minima should not be regard ed as the norm. Although the CPT has never laid down such a norm directly, indications are that it would consider 9 to 10m2 as a desirable size for a cell for one prisoner. This is an area in which the CPT could make an ongoing contribution that would build on what h as already been laid down in this regard. What is required is a detailed examination of what size of cell is acceptable for the accommodation of various numbers of persons. A ttention needs to be paid to the number of hours that prisoners spend locked in the cells, when determining appropriate sizes. Even for prisoners who spend a large amount of time out of their cells, there must be a clear minimum space, which meets standards of human dignity. *** Article 66 Prisoner has a right to accommodation that fulfills contemporary hygienic conditions and local climate conditions Article 67 Rooms in which the prisoners live and work mu st be clean, dry, aerated, heated and with enough light, both natural and artificial that en ables reading and work, without any sight obstructions. The dormitory must be spacious enough so that each prisoner has at least 8 cubic meters of space. Rooms must have adequate sanitary instal lments and means for personal hygiene. Every prisoner has a right to personal (separate) bed. Sanitary facilities 19.1 All parts of every prison shall be properly maintained and kept clean at all times. 19.2 When prisoners are admitted to prison the cells or other accommodation to which they are allocated shall be clean. 9019.3 Prisoners shall have ready access to sanitary facilities that are hygienic and respect privacy. 19.4 Adequate facilities shall be provided so that ev ery prisoner may have a bath or shower, at a temperature suitable to the climate, if possi ble daily but at least twice a week (or more frequently if necessary) in the interest of general hygiene. 19.5 Prisoners shall keep their persons, clothi ng and sleeping accommodation clean and tidy. 19.6 The prison authorities shall provide them with the means for doing so including toiletries and general cleaning implements and materials. 19.7 Special provision shall be made for the sanitary needs of women. ** Rule 19 Rule 19 emphasises both cleanliness of institutions and the personal hygiene of prisoners. The significance of institutional hygiene has been underlined by ECtHR which has held that unhygienic, unsanitary conditio ns, which are often found in combination with overcrowding, contribute to an overall judgment of degrading treatment: Kalashnikov v Russia has also noted \u2014Read y access to proper toilet facilities and the maintenance of good standards of hygiene are essentia l components of a humane and environment.\" (2General Report [C PT/Inf (92)3] at para. 49). There is a link between institutional and pe rsonal hygiene as the prison authorities must enable prisoners to keep themselves and th eir quarters clean by providing them, as required by Rule 19, with the means to do so. It is important that the authorities take overall responsibility for hygiene, also in the cells where prisoners sleep, and that they ensure that these cells are clean when pris oners are admitted. Conversely all prisoners can, if able to do so, be expected at l east to keep themselves and their immediate environment clean and tidy. Although the Rules do not deal directly with beards, as they did in the past, personal cleanliness and tidiness include proper care of hair, including the trimming or shaving of beards, for which provision must be made by the authorities. However, heads should never be saved as matte r of routine or for disciplinary reasons, as this is inherently humiliating (see Yankov v Bu lgaria (appl. nr. 39084/97 sanitary needs of women refe rred to in Rule 19.7 includes ensuring that women have access to sanitary protection as well as means of disposal. Provision also needs to be made for pregnant or breast f eeding women to bath or shower more often than twice a week. In the context of hygiene access to various f acilities is of particular importance. These include sanitary facilities, and baths and showers. Such access requires the close attention of the prison authorities to ensure both that the facilities are available and that access to them is not denied. *** Article 69 Prisoners' hygiene and hygiene in the rooms are regularly monitored in rooms. Clothing and bedding 91 21. Every prisoner shall be provided with a separate bed and separate and appropriate bedding, which shall be kept in good orde r and changed often enough to ensure its cleanliness. **Rule 21 Rule 21 is largely self explanatory. Beds a nd bedding are very important to prisoners in practice. \u2014Bedding\" in this Rule includ es a bed frame, mattress and bed linen for each prisoner. 20.1 Prisoners who do not have ade quate clothing of their own sh all be provided with clothing suitable for the climate. 20.2 Such clothing shall not be degrading or humiliating. 20.3 All clothing shall be maintained in go od condition and replaced when necessary. 20.4 Prisoners who obtain permission to go outs ide prison shall not be required to wear clothing that identifies them as prisoners. **Rule 20 The issues of clothing and bedding are closel y related to those of hygiene: inadequate clothing and unsanitary bedding can all contribut e to a situation which may be held to contravene Article 3 of the ECHR. The sp ecific provisions of Rules 20 and 21 indicate to the prison authorities what active steps mu st be taken to avoid such a situation. Cleanliness extends to a requirement that unde rclothes, for example, are changed and washed as often as hygiene may require. Note that Rule 20 must be read with Rule 97 which explicitly gives untried prisoners the choice of wearing their own clothes. The Rules do not stipulate whether or not sentenced prisoners should be compelled to wear uniforms. They do no not outlaw or encourage such a practice. However, if sentenced pris oners are compelled to wear uniforms of any kind, they must meet the requirements of Rule 20.2. This Rule places a new emphasis on prisoner's dignity in respect of the clothing that must be provided. As it applies to all pris oners, it means that any uniforms that may be provided to sentenced prisoners should not be degrading and humiliating: uniforms that tend towards the caricature of the \"convict' are therefore prohibited. Protection of prisoners' dignity also underlies the require ment that prisoners who go outside the prison should not wear clothes that identify them as prisoners. It is particularly important that when they appear in court they are provided with clothing appropriate for the occasion. Implicit in the requirement in Rule 20.3 th at clothing should be maintained in good condition, is that prisoners should have facilities for washing and drying their clothes. *** Article 67 Every prisoner has a right to personal (separate) bed. Article 72 Prisoner has a right to free underwear, clothes and shoes, which are adequate for local climate conditions. 92When work that he performs requires, prisoner h as a right to special work clothes, shoes and equipment. Article 73 Prisoners' clothes must not seem degrading or humiliating. Director of Directorate can allow the prisoners to wear their own clothes in the open-type Penitentiary or open departme nt of the Penitentiary. Overcrowding and accomodation 18.1 The accommodation provided for prisoners, and in particular all sleeping accommodation, shall respect human dignity and, as far as possible, privacy, and meet the requirements of health and hygiene, due regard being paid to climatic conditions and especially to floor space, cubic content of air, lighting, heating and ventilation. 18.3 Specific minimum requirements in respect of the matters referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be set in national law. 18.6 Accommodation shall only be shared if it is suitable for this purpose and shall be occupied by prisoners suitable to associate with each other. **Rule 18 This Rule concerns accommodation. Developm ents in European human rights law have meant that rules about accommodation have to be strengthened. Conditions of accommodation collectively, and overcrowding in particular, can constitute inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and thus contravene Article 3 of the ECHR. This has now been fully recognised by the European Court of Human Rights in a number of decisions (See, for example, Kalashnikov v Russia (appl. nr. 47095/99 15/072002). Moreover, the authorities have to consider the special needs of prisoners: to accommodate a severely disabled person in pr ison without providing additional facilities may amount to inhuman or degrading treat ment (Price v United Kingdom -appl. nr. 33394/96 10/07/2001). Physical accommodation includes both space in cells and issues such as access to light and air. The importance of access to natural light and fresh air is reflected in the separate Rule 18.2 and underlined by the CPT in its 11th General Report [CPT/Inf (2001)16] at para. 30. Windows should not be covered or have opaque glass. It is recognized that in Northern Europe it may not always be possible to read or work by natural light in winter. Rule 18 includes some new elements. The first, in Rule 18.3, is intended to compel governments to declare by way of nationa l law specific standards, which can be enforced. Such standards would have to meet wider considerations of human dignity as well as practical ones of health and hygiene. The CPT, by commenting on conditions and space available in prisons in various countries has begun to indicate some minimum standards. These are considered to be 4m2 for prisoners in shared accommodation and 6m2 for a prison cell. These minima are, related however, to wider analyses of specific prison systems, including studies of how much time prisoners actually spend in their cells. These minima should not be regard ed as the norm. Although the CPT has never laid down such a norm directly, indications are that it would consider 9 to 10m2 as a desirable size for a cell for one prisoner. This is an area in which the CPT could make an ongoing contribution that would build on what h as already been laid down in this regard. 93What is required is a detailed examinati on of what size of cell is acceptable for the accommodation of various numbers of persons. A ttention needs to be paid to the number of hours that prisoners spend locked in the cells, when determini ng appropriate sizes. Even for prisoners who spend a large amount of time out of their cells, there must be a clear minimum space, which meets standards of human dignity. Another important innovation is Rule 18.4, which provides for national strategies enshrined in law to deal with overcrowding. Prison populations are as much a product of the operation of criminal justice systems as th ey are of crime rates. This needs to be recognised both in general criminal justice strategies and in specific rules relating to what happens when prisons are threatened w ith a level of overcrowding that would result in a failure to meet the minimum norms that governments are required to set by Rule 18.3. Rule 18.4 does not stipulate how overcrowding should be reduced. In some countries for instance new admissions are re stricted or even stopped when maximum capacity has been reached. Prisoners who se continued liberty does not constitute a serious danger to the public are put on a waiting list. A strategy to deal with overcrowding requires at least the establishment of clear maximum capacity levels for all prisons. Recommendation (99)22 of the Committee of Ministers on Prison Overcrowding and Prison Population Inflati on should be considered both when overall strategies and when specific national rules to prevent overcrowding are developed. Rule 18.5 retains the principle of single cel ls, which, especially for long term and life prisoners, constitute their homes, although it is not always followed. (Rule 96 emphasizes that the principle applies in a similar way to untried prisoners.) Some departures from this principle are merely ways of dealing with overcrowding and are unacceptable as long-term solutions. Existing prison architecture along with other factors may also make it difficult to accommodate prisoners in single cells. However, when new prisons are built the requirement of accommoda tion in single cells should be taken into account. The Rule recognises that the interests of prisoners may require an exception to the principle of housing them in single cells. It is important to note that this exception is limited to instances where prisoners woul d benefit positively from joint accommodation. This requirement is underlined by Rule 18. 6, which stipulates that only prisoners who are suitable to associate shall be accommoda ted together. Non-smokers should not be compelled to share accommodation with smokers, for example. Where accommodation is shared, the occurrence of any form of bul lying, threat or violence between prisoners should be avoided by ensuring adequate staff supervision. The CPT has pointed out (11th General Report [CPT/Inf (2001) 16] at para. 29) that large-capacity dormitories are inherently undesirable. They hold no benef its for prisoners that are not outweighed by single cells for sleeping purposes. Single ce lls at night do not imply a limit on association during the day. The benefit of privacy during sleeping hours needs to be balanced with the benefit of human c ontact at other times (see Rule 50.1). The importance of ensuring appropriate acco mmodation is further strengthened in the new version of Rules by treating it in co mbination with issues of allocation. The allocation rules have been reinforced by sta ting clearly and simply the various categories of prisoners that must be separated from each other. The requirement in Rule 18.8.c for separa ting older prisoners from younger prisoners should be read in combination with the Ru le 11, which requires that persons under the age of 18 years should be kept out of adult prisons entirely. The separation of young prisoners from adults includes the peremptory international requirement, set by Article 37.3(c) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, for the separation of children and adults: children in that context are defined as any person under the age of 18 years. Rule 18.8.c is intended also to pr ovide for the additional separation of younger 94prisoners, sometimes referred to as young adu lts, who may be older than 18 years of age, but who are not yet ready to be integrated with other adult prisoners: this is in line with the more flexible definition of a juvenile in the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice. It is now recognised that the separation betw een various categories of prisoners referred to in Rule 18.8 needs not always be rigi d. However, these forms of separation were introduced to protect potentially weaker pris oners, whose vulnerability to abuse has not ceased. Rule 18.9 provides for relaxation of th e strict separation requirements but limits it to cases where prisoners consent to it. In addition such relaxation must form part of a deliberate policy on the part of the authorities that is designed to benefit prisoners. It should not merely be a solution to practical problems, such as overcrowding. Rule 18.10. which requires that the least r estrictive security arrangements compatible with the risk of prisoners escaping or harmi ng themselves or others should be used, also allows for the protection of society to be taken into consideration when deciding on appropriate accommodation. *** Article 66 Prisoner has a right to accommodation that fulfills contemporary hygi enic conditions and local climate conditions. Classification of a prisoner in the premises for collective stay and dormitories will be conducted with careful estimation of all the circ umstances and data for which the evidence is made in the Admission Service, especially bearing in mind age, personal nature and tendency, as well as other characteristics upon which positive mutual influence and lack of danger of mutual physical and mental menace depend. Disabled prisoner has a right to accommodation compa tible to type and level of his disability. Article 67 Rooms in which the prisoners live and work mu st be clean, dry, aerated, heated and with enough light, both natural and artificial that en ables reading and work, without any sight obstructions. The dormitory must be spacious enough so that each prisoner has at least 8 cubic meters of space. Rooms must have adequate sanitary instal lments and means for personal hygiene. Every prisoner has a right to personal (separate) bed. 957. Prison staff 7.1. 7.1.1.

The Treatment Service Treatment service consists of: 14 treatment officers, assisted by 4 sociologists, volunteers from the National employment service; 1 person responsible for cultural and exercise and recreation activities; two chiefs; 1 social worker; one psychologist and one executive officer. The Head of the department is responsib le for the functioning of the service who responses to the warden of the penitentiary. The functioning of the treatment service as well as the department for personality examination ar e in charge of the chiefs of these services responding to the Head of the department. The treat ment officers and members of the team inside the department for personality analyses response to the chiefs of the departments. The monitoring of the treatment officers' administration is performed once a month. In their work the treatment officers keep the following records: a register, the records on the flow of the prisoners in the treatmen t group, records on scheduled and unscheduled interviews, records on evaluation of the influence upon the punishment for an annual and six month period, the records of opinions required by judicial authorities and ministry, weekly, monthly and annual reports and plans. There is a dim sight that all other services s hould conciliate their work in regard to the treatment service as a key service in order to accomp lish the basic aim of the Law on execution of penal sanctions - the treatment of the prisoners. The restrictive cause is an insufficient numbe r of treatment officers compared to the overall number of prisoners so that it is absolutely necessary to employ drastically more treatment officers, psychologists as being suggested, in order to improve the function of the services. In 97addition, an adequate training should be pe rformed due to enabling the group work of the treatment officers. . In order to accomplish the basic aim of the Law on execution of penal sanctions the systematic activities should be pre-arranged to assi st the prisoners in returning to free society after release. Although there is no legal act concerning this matter, it is not being distinguished as a specific, very important section in the process of resocialization and prevention of repeated offence to the penetritiary. Every change, even if it is getting much better, is a stress due to the adaptation to a new way of living which is conveni ent for the prisoner who spent a long period of time in penetritiary conditions being away from a family and usual surrounding. Regarding the repeated offence to the penetritiary no particular attention is given in terms of that the repeated offence to the penetritiary is not only the total number of recommitted crimes, but the set of causally advised internal and extern al changes related of the imprisoned. According to this, it is considered needed for the returned prisoner to be taken over and again treated by the same treatment officer as he was during the previous servitude, considering it as a rule and not as eventuality. 1) Opinions of the interviewed treatmen t officers regarding the treatment service Nine out of ten treatment officers have been interviewed (22/02/08). All treatment officers interviewed by the team members are satisfied with their work, salary as well as the payment constancy and overtime work refund. There aren't any dissatisfied with the coopera tion with other services. The cooperation with the security service is considered the best and th e cooperation with the medical service is not so much efficient. The treatment as a work aspect of the treatmen t officers is being labored at the moment due to a number of prisoners treated by each and ever y treatment officer (the workgroups treated by the interviewed treatment officers consist of 65 to 84 prisoners). The team is of the opinion that those treatment groups should be reset to 40 prisoners at the most in order to accomplish the actual work quality as well as to evaluate their work efficiency. Working with more than 40 prisoners in a gr oup the treatment officer is not able to respond to the requests of his job description. In addition, there aren't any technical facilities (computers) so that their work seems to be only administra tive. The technical conditions have being improved since the visit carried out on 22/02/08 when in the following month period three notebook and 20 used computers have been purchased. Approximately half of the interviewed is satisfi ed with the work organization and the rest is of the opinion that they would be much more engaged in their work if the following conditions are fulfilled: better communication between the services, improved technical facilities, the number of groups treated by the treatment officer is reasonable. It recognized that the treatment service is very important for the functioning of the penetritiary. The interpersonal relations in the service are good. The interviewed treatment officers feel that the warden and the head officer take good care of the service. They make regular contacts with them, they are always available and they understand the difficulties the treatment officers face to. The workday of the treatment officers starts with a meeting after which they make already scheduled half an hour interviews with 2-3 pris oners. The next regular interview with the same prisoner is made not earlier than a month. The rest of the working day is planned for giving help 98to the prisoners with actual problems regarding writing submissions to the authorities in and out of the penetritiary. The number of the cont acts made is 10 to 15 prisoners a day. The individual approach of the treatment offi cer working with each of the prisoners is based on the personality analyses done by the Admission service. The treatment officers were not specially trained before starting their service in the penetritiary. They attend various seminars. The interviewed treatment officers consider that in the preparation for the release of the prisoners the interview with the prisoner should be include d three days before being released from the penetritiary related to family matters and possi ble difficulties the prisoner may come across after the release. This also includes making contacts w ith the Centre for Social Work in terms of providing support in giving a certain short run fina ncial aid. It is a pleasant acknowledgment that 7 out of 9 treatment officers meet the families of the prisoners who they work with which is one of their job demands considering it favorable fo r gaining some relevant information about the needs and difficulties of the prisoners. The potential incidents between informal grou ps are resolved by removing in due time. Summing up, the interviewed treatment officer s do not experience their work as a high job- related stress. All of them state there haven' t been any physical assault towards the treatment officers but there have been threats.They are not afraid of the assault. One of jeopardized situations are affective stat es of the prisoners under the influence of drugs and shortly after the prisoner has been self-injured. The subjective feeling of safety of the treatme nt officers, as stated by the interviewed, depends on the dormitory they are located in. They don't turn to superior officers i order to bring safety to the higher extent because they think it is not possible due to the circumstances. In general, the interviewed consider th at there is no evidence of corruption in their service whereas some of them think there is corruption in other services but there isn't enough evidence. The treatment officers are of the opinion that the relationship between them and the prisoners is acceptable. The prisoners trust the treatment officers and they ask them for help and support related to personal problems and difficulties they may have during their residence in the penetritiary. The treatment officers consider the prisoner as a person who needs help. The treatment officers state there is no prejudi ce toward the prisoners except for some minor exceptions of prejudice made toward prisoners who committed the crime against sexual freedom, but they try not to manifest it in working with them. The treatment officers consider that there aren 't, or it isn't recognizable, any privileges for certain group of prisoners. The interviewed are of the opinion that they accomplish the aim of the treatment according to the plan and work programme of the Law on execu tion of penal sanctions. It is not recognizable that the law is not the frame of possible f unctioning regarding optimum and maximum, but minimum and the list of prohibitions.The treatment officers state that they themselves often create their work in terms of the plans given. They use the following techniques: interviews, consulting the prisoners, observation and rarely testing. 1) Opinions of the prisoners regarding the Treatment service 5 prisoners have been interviewed In regard to the existence of corruption and the way it is manifested, the interviewed give different opinions from stating there isn't any corru ption, others being indirectly informed about its existence, and some of them stating that th e corruption exists. On the other hand there is an overall opinion that drug dealing, mobile phones and other prohibited selli ng undoubtedly exist. 99The prisoners say that they regularly meet w ith the treatment officers once in three months, being more often due to the need, on their de mand and regarding the subjects not related to treatment. The prisoners have no idea what kind of prepar ation they should have before the release except for being transferred to a better dormitory th an the one they are locat ed in. They think they don't have any perspective after serving their sentenc e and that it is not much possible for them to get a job unless they originate from a wealthy family. Any of the treatment officers hasn't been acqua inted with the families of the prisoners. One of the prisoners think it would be a good idea wh ereas most of them haven't thought about it. The interviewed prisoners feel there is a lack of warmth showed by the treatment officers. They would also like to talk to them more. To the interviewed ones a good treatment officer is the one who talks to the prisoners, a good listener and adviser, a helper and mo re important an honest person. At the moment there is an opinion that th e treatment officers don't know the interviewed enough and that they would show more interest for their personal problems if they work with smaller groups. The treatment officers are considered as unbiased. The relationship between the treatment offi cers and the prisoners is fairly good. Being asked about the addressing of the treatment officers, they say they are seen like human beings. They are addressed by name although ther e are cases when they are addressed by registry number. 3)The interview with the Head of the Treatment service The Head officer is of the opinion that th e coordination with other services is good being slightly minor with the medical service whereas being worst with Deligrad due to the lack of work. The service is highly quoted due to the coordi nating work with the prisoners in terms of the treatment officers being involved in the process of making all decisions related to the prisoners. The coordination with the director is good. There is an opinion that the current or ganization of the service despite the present difficult circumstances (insufficient number of treatment officers compared to the number of prisoners and the lack of technical facilities) is good. It is necessary to employ 5 more treatment officers. In these working circumstances the pr iority is the safety of the prisoners. The Head of the treatment service states th ere is no corruption existing in the service. There are no privileged prisoners and the potentia l conflicts between informal groups and/or prisoners are prevented being re moved to different wards. Interesting is the opinion of the Head of the treatment service, being matched with the statements of the prisoners, that false and unreal promises given by the treatment officers without any possibility of being fulfilled are considered as a venture. 7.1.3. The security service 1)About security service At the time of the interview (09/07/08) ther e were 248 officers in the service which is 4 prisoners per 1 officer. The Security service is strictly hierarchi cal with clearly defined duties but without precise and clearly distinguished responsibilities and their content. In an orderly manner the upmost groups are t hose of prisoners and officers being at the same time in a constant daily direct contact. Th erefore, it was considered that among other issues 100it was important to find out about the quality of their interrelation, from both perspectives. The aim of the interviews of the prisoners was to contribute to understanding of the working environment of the officers. The existing number of security service members implies to the confirmed lack of the employees directly affecting the safety level of the service members as well as the prisoners. Besides the insufficient number of the employees there is a lack of knowledge and skills essential for the qualitative and adequate functions service, according to th e international standards. There is a lack of conceived system of continuing, tim ely manner and constantly available training for the employed in this service beginning at the mome nt of admission into the service to the retiring. Also, there is a lack of exchanging knowledge and experience among the members of the service from the various penitentiaries in the region as we ll as the transfer of knowledge and experience from elders to young people. The safety of the security service employees as well as the prisoners would be at a greater extent if the whole penitentiary were under the video surveillance. The designing task for installing the video surveillance has being done since January 18th, 2008., but we are not informed about whether it is only applied to the so litary confinement, isolation rooms, or to the whole area. There is an overall opinion of the interviewe d members of the security service that the salaries are inadequate compared to the risks and heavy duty conditions. Besides, it is noted that there aren't any records about the residential and social status of the employees, and hat there isn't any possible stimulation. Due to the heavy duty conditions, the high extent of risk and the constant exposure to job-relate d stress, there is an opinion that the above mentioned possibilities would positively affect the members of the service and the function of the service would be greatly improved. 2) The opinions of the officers interv iewed about the Security service There were altogether 14 interviewed officers chosen by the random sample method from the daily record of the security service employees with th e date of the visit (Ja nuary 18th, 2008.) The relation between the prisoners and security service employees is on the whole assessed as correct and professional with certain restraints in terms of that the qua lity of relation depends on prisoners' behavior. The prisone rs rarely confide about their personal problems they have out of the penitentiary while they more often ask advice from the security service employees about certain issues regarding their residence at the pe nitentiary. For example, this is related to the problems or possible conflicts of the prisoners as well as the possibilities of using certain special facilities. . The preview of the interviewed officers about their position at the Security service of the penitentiary, the relation between this and th e other services as well as the position of the Security service at the penitentiary system: All of the interviewed are of the opinion that the Security service is the most important one at the penitentiary system. There is a prevaili ng opinion that the Security service is in a good relation with the other services due to effective job organization itself. The best cooperation is with the Treatment service which they are constan tly referred to. The less evident is the relation with the Medical service. Regarding the coope ration with the other services they are not constantly referred to, the relations are considered as being correct. All of the interviewed consider the interre lations among the members of the service are good. Regarding their financial status all of them consider their salaries small and insufficient 101compared to the heavy duty conditions and respons ibilities and that the only vantage is the fact that the salaries are being regular. The interviewed are of the opinion that the Head of the service takes care of the employees without stating the way of doing that. Regarding the Head of the security service the relation is considered correct and professional and th at his service is constantly advisable when it is needed. Regarding the personal safety almost none of the interviewed feel completely safe during their service. According to the opinion of the interv iewed the lowest level of safety is at the \"C\" department not only due to the fact that there are most of the drug users but also due to the insufficient number of security service employees compared to the number of prisoners at the department. According to the opinion of the interv iewed especially dangerous situations are those resulting at the moment of fight among the prisoners, during the counting as well as isolating the imprisoned and conducting them out of the penitentiary area. The drug addicts are considered to be potentially dangerous group. The increased safety extent is related to the increased number of security service employees, less number of prisoners at a department as well as the employed prisoners. Some of the interviewed recquired from the superiors taking certain measures in making the safety extent higher. According to their opini on this is possible to perform by increasing the number of Security service employees at the recognisible and potentially crucial situations, installing video survaillance, and above all pur chasing the proper devices for interconnection. After submitting our report (18/01/08) in th e first place related to the Security service 21 motorolas were purchased. According to the statemen t of the Head of the Security service this is, among with existing ones, the sufficient number for providing the safety of the employees in the security service in the circumstances in which th eir safety directly depends on their ability to communicate with the others employed in the service. All of the interviewed stated that when they come into knowing of any crucial information related to the jeopardizing the safety of anyone at the penitentiary, the notice is given to the superior. Also, the superior is informed about any information gained by the members of the Security service related to informal groups. Searching of the prisoners and dormitories in order to find potential weapons is done regularly based on certain clues and it is be ing recorded.The prisoners use door handles, broomsticks, spoons, radiator or be d bars, razor blades as weapons. The interviewed asked about the possible corrup tion existence mainly states that they are not informed, some states that it is possible, and the others implies or states the corruption is present as it is case with any other service. On the whole, they consider there are neither privileged indi viduals nor groups of prisoners whereas some of the interviewed are of the opinion there are privileged individuals but according to the team they are not aware of the fact what the privilege actually is. A small number of the interviewed consider there is a prejudice toward the Muslims and that it is resulted in a kind of rude verbal a ddressing. They dislike a group of drug addicts due to the objective fear of their aggressiveness and possi ble spreading of some of the infective diseases. They feel no need to treat th e members of those groups any differently but in compliance with law. The searching of the security service employ ees is performed occasionally lately being more usual than before. 3) The opinion of the prisoners about the security service 102The interviewed prisoners, 5 of them, were chosen from documentation of disciplinary procedure against the imprisoned taking into account as the only criterion that the imprisoned in the disciplinary procedure were found guilty. The imprisoned address the Security service employees with a certain respect. The interviewed imprisoned either are not ab le to mention anything they like about the members of the Security service or they emph asizes their correctness. Regarding what they dislike about the members of Security service th ey mainly agree in the opinion that often members of Security service use force without particular reason and depending on their daily mood. Although the number of examinees is negligible these opinions are taken into account because they match with the statemen ts of the interviewed prisoners during a number of visits. Being without almost any exception the inte rviewed don't have enough confidence in the officers to address them for any crucial advice. It can be stated that the impression of the inte rviewed prisoners is that there is a lack of humanely respect of the Security service towards th e interviewed. The Security service's correct attitude toward the prisoners depends only on the extent of respecting written and unwritten rules at the penitentiary. Regarding violence among the prisoners which the members of the security service should deal with in the context of their work, it mainly results from unsolved indebted relations in terms of forbidden issues at the penitentiary like dr ugs or mobile phones. The frequency of physical revenge among the prisoners is va rious depending on a department in which they are situated. The important cause contributing to the aggressi on among the prisoners is a lack of the well organized spare time All of the interviewed are of the opinion that the corruption exists and directly influences the relationship between the stuff and the prisoners as well as the functioning of the privileged groups. The privileged groups are considered to be present and that they directly result from cooperation of certain members of the Security and Treatment service w ith the certain members of these groups and that the used privileges are various. There is a prevailing opinion that there are pr ejudices of the security officers towards the prisoners in the first place in terms of being th e members of the group in the status of being sentenced for a certain crime, during their servit ude. There are also prejudices towards the sort of crime committed because of which certain prisoners are at the penitentiary. 4) The interview with the Head of the security service Taking into account the interview with the Head of the Security service it is obvious that this service is hierarchically organized in compliance wi th the law and relatively effectively integrated into the penitentiary system. According to the opi nion of the Head of the service it is of great importance for the functioning of the penitentiary du e to the fact that it is the largest and the only service engaged 24 hours a day. He is of the opinion that the functioning of the service is relatively good rated and that he is absolutely co nvinced that there are po ssibilities for a raise in pay due to the heavy duty conditions. He considers the basic problem for improvement of the service the financial aspect and, in the first place, the insufficiency of technical facilities as well as the House rules incompatibility with the Law on execution of Penal Sanctions. 5) Mechanism of Security service's work control: The control of the Security service is performed in such a way that the officials being at the hierarchically higher position monitor those who are subordinated. The organization chart is as like: 103 The executive trainees are at the lowest hierar chical position, the execu tives are at the higher extent, then the senior ex ecutives, the supervisors, the senior s upervisors, the senior official with a schedule of defense, the organizer of the secu rity service and finally the Head of the service During the routine of the Security service the s upervisors (superintendent) control the work of the executives while the work of the supervisor s (superintendent) is controlled both by the organizer and the Head of the service. The re port on the employees' work in the service is submitted once a year according to which there is a possibility for advancing in the service. In the case of work omission the supervisors (s uperintendent) submit official reports to the Head of the service who then determines all neces sary facts gained by the others employed in the service as well as the statement of the employee who committed a work omission. If the supervisor (superintendent) is of the opinion th at the disciplinary procedure is needed to be performed the Head of the penitentiary is notified about it. Each and every punishment of the employed in the service is entirely performed through the disciplinary procedure. According to the official report, during the year 2007 there were 16 disciplinary procedures against the employed in the Security service. Out of total 14 procedures for heavy work omission only one has been related to work omission in terms of not informing the superiors about the applied restraint measures against the imprisoned. The number is pretty small compared not only to the number of performed disciplinary proced ures but also even more to the number of employees in the security service. This number is quite unreliable and is the consequence of the lack of controlling mechanisms in which someone out of the security system is included. The procedure related to this particular case was perfo rmed due to the request of our team in the case of the imprisoned Draganovi which we followed till the expiry date of his sentence. 7.1.4. Health care Health care is consisted of a dentistry a nd medical services. The dentistry includes a dentist and a dental technician.The medical service consists of three general medical practitioners, a specialist for sport medicine, a general medical specialist, a part time practitioner, and nine technicians whereof six are general medical t echnicians, one sanitary technician and one pharmaceutical technician. There are also practitioners out of the penitentiary employed on call as specialists such as: an internist, twice a month, a surgeon, once a week, an optician, once a week, a radiologist, once in two weeks, biochemical spec ialist, once in two weeks, and a psychiatrist employed from Monday to Friday, due to the recommendation given during the visitation on February 22, 2008, on establishing the cooperation with the Mental Hospital in Toponica. The team is of the opinion that the health policy in the penitentiary is necessary to be integrated into the national health policy.This is the only way for the imprisoned to be treated without discrimination, compared with other citizens, in regard to receiving basic medical care. The weakness of the system is not possible to overcome even if there is maximum demand set up of the practitioners and the highest work quality. The personnel in this service are not given enough opportunities for professional training and advancing in their practice or specialization, which is their need. This would surely contribute to improvement of medical services and higher health care quality of the imprisoned. There is no analyst technician who is curren tly part-time engaged twice a week. There is a need for one general medical practitioner a nd one full-time engaged psychiatrist. The medical service is currently disposed of technical conditions needed for cases of urgency. There is no dispensary and resuscitation set as well as the ambulance car fully equipped with previously mentioned sets. The positive act regarding this service are lectures that are going to be given by the practitioners to the prisoners about the prevention of spreading transferable infectious and sexual diseases. 104 2. Insight to medical records The aim of one of the visits was to examin e the qualifying and organizational abilities of the medical service in the penitentiary at Ni as well as their competence for applying their knowledge on prisoners without any prejudice. Th e importance of this service is dual-purpose and it should be always bared in mind. This service: - Take care of the health of the prisoners - Records and reports any sign or indication that prisoners may have been ill-treated and tortured The article 130/ Law on Execution of Prison Sa nctions it is stated the obligation of the medical service to examine the prisoner after the restraint measures are implemented. The team members didn't have any access to these reports. The article 103.6/ Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions/it is stated the obligation of the Medical service to keep special records about in juries of the prisoners.The team members did have access to these records. They were convin ced that there was a compatibility between the patients' records of the prisoners and protocol on injuries. This protocol includes all types of injuries regardless the way they have been made .There are the following data: record number, name and surname of the prisoner, registry number of the prisoner in the penitentiary, the date-the hour and the day of the examination; the injuries ar e classified as slight and severe, made at work or out of work, self-injuring, or injuries caused by the official as well as the practitioner's name and injury description. We have received records for period September-December, 2007, on numbers individually for each month according to the type an d seriousness of injuries. In September there were 13, as well as in October, in November 21, in December 5. During this period there were 14 injuries made at work, out of work 31, self - in jured 6, injuries caused by the official 1. The CHR Ni team is certain that the number of injuries caused by restraint measures is at least 2 due to the fact that the injury of the ex-convict Draganovi on October 22, 2007 had not been properly registered nor it was later revised .This implies to the lack of methodology in keeping records in which nobody is responsible for revising defaults made due to the non- compliance of certain members of the medical service. The method of keeping these records does not in clude the monitoring of the data validity and as well as revising possible defaults beforehand. The injury records comply with the data given in medical records. The findings in medical records should be complied with the st atements of the prisoners. 16 prisoners were interviewed and they all confirmed that they received medical care after restraint measures were applied. Assuming that the prisoner can not be sure if (and what) has been written in the medical record, the team member compared the statement of the prisoner with the medical record of the same prisoner. They were the same. 3. The opinion of the prisoners on medical service system The interviewed prisoners were chosen in the following way: -The six prisoners whose medical records were randomly chosen from the card file -The seven from Increased Supervision Department -The three prisoners who were subjected of restraint measures -One prisoner who requested an interview with CHR Ni in advance The prisoners were interviewed on the following subjects, according to the groups of questions: a) Access to medical services: 105In most of the cases the prisoners stated that the medical practitioners are available, ie the prisoners are examined on their request b esides regular weekly examination. b) Treatment of the medical practitioners There is an opinion of the prisoners that the practitioners are qualif ied enough. They were asked if the practitioners showed any concern fo r their patients and some of the interviewed thought that certain practitioners were not inte rested enough for the patients pains. One of the prisoners complained about not receiving the adequate therapy regarding the diagnosis established before entering the penitentiary. After making an insight into the medical record of the prisoner the team confirmed that the comp laint of the prisoner was not probable. The overall opinion of the interviewed about th e medical service system is favorable but the fact is that the sample of the interviewed is quite small for any conclusion on this subject. 3. The interview with the Head of the medical service The Head of the service is aware of the fact that there are certain restrictions due to the lack of interference of Ministry of Health into th e system of this medical service and by using his knowledge and experience is willing to give contribution to improvement of the service. 4. Controlling mechanism of the Medical service system According to the existing law the monitoring is carried by the Head of the medical service, the Director of penitentiary by subordination - coordination. Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Health are of the higher authority. Besides these it is possible to provide an external control by different independent or ganizations and authorities. There is a lack of readiness of the practiti oners employed in the medical service for improvement of the quality of their own service which is possible to bring to a higher level by establishing the internal work e fficiency evaluation. This is quite possible due to the small number of employers. 106 7.2.Selection of Articles of EPR and Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions related to Chapter PRISON STAFF * European Prison Rules ** Commentary to Recommendation Rec (2006) 2 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the European Prison Rules *** Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions Generalities 76. Staff shall be carefully selected, properly trained, both at the outset and on a continuing basis, paid as professional workers and have a status that civil society can respect. **Rule 76 This Rule relates to the selection, training a nd conditions of recruitment of prison staff. Recruitment is very important. The prison ad ministration should have a clear policy to encourage suitable individuals to apply to work in prisons and to inform them of the required ethical rules. Many prison authorities have great difficulty in recruiting staff of a high quality. This can be for a variety of reasons. It may be due to low levels of salary. It may be because the standing of prison work in the local comm unity is very low. It may be because of competition from other law enforcement agen cies such as the police. Therefore prison administrations should have to pursue an active recruitment policy. 77. When selecting new staff the prison author ities shall place great emphasis on the need for integrity, humanity, professional capacity and personal suitability for the complex work that they will be required to do. **Rule 77 This Rule deals with the selection criteria of staff. The prison administration should introduce a clear set of procedures to test th e integrity and humanity of the applicants and how they are likely to respond in the diffi cult situations which they may well face so that to ensure that only those applicants who are suitable are in fact selected to join the prison system. 78. Professional prison staff shall normally be appointed on a permanent basis and have public service status with security of empl oyment, subject only to good conduct, efficiency, good physical and mental health a nd an adequate standard of education. **Rule 78 107This Rule is a consequence of Rule 71. If staff are to be committed to their work on a long-term basis they need to be secure in th eir employment. In jurisdictions where there are prisons that are managed by private contractors, individual members of staff employed by these contractors should be approved by the prison authority before working with prisoners. They should also be employed on a permanent basis. 79.1 Salaries shall be adequate to attr act and retain suitable staff. 79.2 Benefits and conditions of empl oyment shall reflect the exacting nature of the work as part of a law enforcement agency. **Rule 79 This Rule underlines the need to ensure attractive salaries and working conditions. The standing of a profession is measured in large part by the level of salary which it attracts. Governments should recognise that prison st aff are entitled to a proper remuneration corresponding to the public service character of prison work as well as to their difficult and sometimes dangerous work, while also taki ng into consideration that if staff are not paid at an appropriate level this may lead to corruption. In many countries prisons are in very isolated locations thus depriving not only staff but also their families of access to schools, to medical facilities, to shops and to other social activities. In addition, many prison staff are expected to transfer regularly from one prison to another, to uproot their families and to move them to places that are sometimes far away. In some countries prison staff were keen to continue to be part of the Ministry of the Interior in order to benefit from a highe r status (access to free health care, to free education, to free housing and to free or s ubsidised transport and holidays). In such circumstances, other conditions of employme nt are as important as levels of pay and should be carefully examined. 80. Whenever it is necessary to employ part-time staff, these criteria shall apply to them as far as that is appropriate. **Rule 80 This Rule refers to part-time staff. In smaller prisons it may be necessary to recruit some staff, especially for specialist tasks on a part-time basis. They should have the same conditions of employment pro rata as full-time staff. 81.1 Before entering into duty, staff shall be gi ven a course of training in their general and specific duties and be required to pass theoretical and practical tests. 81.2 Management shall ensure that, throughout th eir career, all staff maintain and improve their knowledge and professional capacity by a ttending courses of in-service training and development to be organised at suitable intervals. 81.3 Staff who are to work with specific groups of prisoners, such as foreign nationals, women, juveniles or mentally ill prisoners, etc., shall be given specific training for their specialised work. 81.4 The training of all staff shall include instru ction in the international and regional human rights instruments and standards, especially the European Convention on Human Rights 108and the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, as well as in the application of the European Prison Rules. ** Rule 81 This Rule addresses the requirements for initia l training of newly selected staff. This training should be adequate and should emphasise the ethical context of their work. Staff should then be given the necessary techni cal training. They need to be made aware of security requirements. They need to learn how to keep proper records and what sort of reports need to be written. The proper training of staff is a requirement that continues from the moment of recruitment to that of final retirement. There should be a regular series of opportunities for continuing development for staff of all ages and ranks. Their training should also extend to the wide range of internatio nal and regional human rights standards concerned with deprivati on of liberty [rules emanating from the European Court of Human Rights and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT)]. *** Article 258 A person can be employed as a trainee if he fu lfills, besides conditions defined by law for the employment in state organs, the following conditions: that is younger than 25, that he served army service, has completed high school and th at is physically and mentally capable of working in the service. A person can be employed as a trainee if older than 25 and younger than 28 if he has higher or university degree. Article 259 Before the employment in security service, bot h mental and physical capabilities of candidate are checked. Trainee probation is done in the Penitentiary or within a special training for trainees. Trainee probation program in the Security servi ce is brought by the Minister in charge of justice. Training of prison staff 81.4 The training of all staff shall include instru ction in the international and regional human rights instruments and standards, especially the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, as well as in the application of the European Prison Rules. **Rule 81 This Rule addresses the requirements for initia l training of newly selected staff.

When selecting new staff the prison author ities shall place great emphasis on the need for integrity, humanity, professional capacity and personal suitability for the complex work that they will be required to do. **Rule 77 This Rule deals with the selection criteria of staff. The prison administration should introduce a clear set of procedures to test th e integrity and humanity of the applicants and how they are likely to respond in the diffi cult situations which they may well face so that to ensure that only those applicants who are suitable are in fact selected to join the prison system. 82. Personnel shall be selected and appointed on an equal basis, without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, langua ge, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, prope rty, birth or other status. **Rule 82 This Rule recalls that there should be no di scrimination in the selection of staff. Women should have the same opportunities as men to work in prisons and should be paid the same salaries, given the same training a nd have the same opportunities for promotion and for assignment to posts requiring specific abilities. These principles shall be applied to staff belonging to racial, cultural, religi ous or sexual minorities. In some prisons a substantial number of prisoners come from th ese minority groups. Where this is the case, prison authorities should make an effort to recruit sufficient proportions of staff from similar backgrounds. *** Article 12 The Management takes up the measures target ed ate permanent professional education and improvement of employees. Article 258 A person can be employed as a trainee if he fu lfills, besides conditions defined by law for the employment in state organs, the following conditions: that is younger than 25, that he served army service, has completed high school and th at is physically and mentally capable of working in the service. A person can be employed as a trainee if older than 25 and younger than 28 if he has higher or university degree. 110 8. Improvement of the work of the services: For complete improvement of prison functioning as a system, in line with EPR, it is necessary: - To provide objectively better pre-conditions , like additional education and better (in every sense) conditions for the work of services and individual within each of the services; - That the prisoner is understood and treated as a person whose penalty is restricted freedom of a movement for a certain period of time, while he/she has right to enjoy all other rights (that belong to each individua l) and which cannot be withdrawn during sentence serving. - Adequate legal framework, proce dures and mechanisms of control Our aim was to find out what is missing so that these two preconditions could be fulfilled simultaneously. That is why, in a set of questions that we asked the staff in services, we included those related to knowing of documents on human rights but as well on prison regulative. The answers are as follows (04.04.08.) 1)What is needed to provide in order to accomplish that the service gives better results in long-term? a) Service for general affairs Expert: a) Knowledge From the area of theory and practice in ex ecution of prison sanctions in European Union countries, by choice, let's say in Great Britain or France or Italy, i.e. a country that is the closest to our regarding economy, mentality, tradition, cu lture and whose experience we use in the area of prison sanctions. b) Skills From the area of getting to know basic office programs in use of computers, especially programs for writing and calculation (Word and Excel) Organizational (for example work planning): Detailed planning of budget needs based on pr ofessionally established regulations for any kind of expenses and incomes, and which should star t with indirect and direct users on the lowest level, as well as organization of control of plans set in this way. Establishment of interactive relation between budget users and Ministry of Fi nance in respect of determination of budget users' real needs. Material conditions (for example, adaptations, ne w wings, specialized classrooms, sports hall, production section, school...) All prison facilities are small and they had cu rrent maintenance and urgent interventions. The priority, above all, is to fix all the roofs, both on dormitories and on economy and 111management buildings. It is also necessary to do thermo-isolation of buildings, to lay on gas into the boiler room, to build a travel network in the prison. Technical conditions (computers...) Every year it is necessary to renew Computer Park and supporting apparatus, video surveillance and technical elements for security . Above all it is necessary to acquire programs (software) for the computers as well as technical, professional support for the maintenance of technique. Diversity in programs makes the wo rd harder and increases maintenance cost. What are anti-stress programs like and how often are they performed? That name is unknown area. Relying to understa nding of terminology they think that they should be organized at least twice a year. Different supports and cooperation: Continuation and improvement of started mu tually useful and in technical sense significantly improved cooperation with the Ministry (introduction of internet connection via e- mail); At least one meeting in three months - on the level of the prison and chiefs of departments, i.e. heads of services. Occasional visits to prisons in surrounding countries b) Health Care Service Expert: a) Knowledge Educations; Expert medicinal courses and seminars; Specializations. b) Skills Courses from the field of ultra-sound Course from the area of urgent medicine Material conditions (for example, adaptations, ne w wings, specialized classrooms, sports hall, production section, school...) Adaptation of a ground building of dispensary building; Rehabilitation of sanitary part; Building of two new rooms for infectious patie nts for their separation from others that are staying in the hospital; Adaptation of two new rooms for psychiatric patients. Technical conditions (for example- computers...) Computers and special person as an administra tor for input of the data in the base; branch-laboratory, one nurse of general practice and one doctor Different supports and cooperation: Cooperation with the Clinic for infectious diseases, program PEGAZIS; 112Clinic for the protection of mental health, Project HIV prevention among the prisoners, supported by the Ministry of Health; Clinical psychologist in Drug free ward; Cooperation and engagement of clinic psychologist c) Treatment Service Expert: a) Knowledge Introduction with methods and forms of work by which subjectivity of treatment officers in estimation of personality and pris oner's behavior will be avoi ded in greatest possible amount; Wider expert education related to issues of prisoners, continual one, bearing in mind that unpredictable situations are always present. Way of occupational therapy organization Training for performance of group work Lectures from the area of addiction diseases and social pathology Computer courses English language courses b) Skills Dialogue skills and ability to transfer that skill to prisoners. Organizational (for example- work planning...) Reduction of number of prisoners in treat ment groups by employing new treatment officers or by reducing the number of prisoners in Penitentiary: Facilitation of administrative work during work time. Material conditions (for example, adaptations, ne w wings, specialized classrooms, sports hall, production section, school...) Construction of new building for the n eeds of the department for personality examination. Construction of universal hall for cultura l, entertaining and sport activities; Allocation of more means for the enlargement of library fund (books) Technical conditions (computers...) Provision of computer equipment and programs; Provision of painting, music and sport requisites Different supports and cooperation: Cooperation with faculties that deal with the topics which are common to Treatment Service; Cooperation with institutions that deal with social pathology; Cooperation with the media. d) Security Service Expert: a) Knowledge Selection of cadres at recruiting; Introduction with new technical advancements; 113Good knowledge of all regulati ons and Law on Execution of Pr ison Sanctions, and acting in line with them within the Service. b) Skills Skills of communication with prisoners; Special physical education (martial skills...) a nd possibility of permanent keeping of physical condition. Organizational (for example- work planning...) To increase the number of employees. Material conditions (for example, adaptations, ne w wings, specialized classrooms, sports hall, production section, school...) Special hall for physical practice of Security Service members; Adaptation of dormitories that were not adapted. Technical conditions (computers...) Development of integral-technical protection; Computers; Video surveillance; Cameras with sensors; Metal detector door. What are anti-stress programs like and how often are they performed ? Interviewees from all the services think that anti-stress programs are necessary for them, but bearing in mind that they haven't had any experi ence with them, so far, they are not able to suggest the type of program. The estimation of treatment frequency is from once a month to twice a year. 2)What is (priorities) in short term needed so that each service (individually) could function better? e) Service for general affairs - First of all employment of missing cadres due to empty work positions. - Programs (software) for the computers in Re gister department and deposit department as well as provision of some book-keeping programs (program for fixed assets, pay accounting...); - Air-conditions, for all the services, both due to the number of people and computers f) Health Care Department - Computers for staff and external collaborators. g) Treatment Service - Provision of computer equipment and programs as well as provision of sport requisites - Reduction of the number of prisoners with whom one treatment officer works. h) Security Service 114- Increase of discipline, respect of the existing hierarchy; - Material satisfaction of the staff- increase of salary. 3)Is there openness for new approaches and co ntents and what would improve personal motivation for the work of each interviewee? There is openness but no interest and self-initiative. Personal motivation for work could be improved by: - Adequate salary - Better human relations - Feeling of being safe when the state is behind them. 4)Education about international regulations (general and imprisonment) Interviewees are not introduced in great am ount with important universal and regional international instruments (Universal declarati on on Human rights, Convention of children rights, European convention on Human rights, Pact on eco nomical, social and cultural right, Convention on elimination of all kinds of women's discrimin ation Convention on elimin ation of all kinds of discrimination...) From the offered list of international documen ts from the area important for the staff in Penitentiary, all the interviewees recognize only Eu ropean Prison Rules, for which they know that exist and that are available in Penitentiary. They think that it would mean a lot to th em if the greater number of Recommendations, conventions and resolutions were translated in Se rbian so that they could get introduced with the contents.(As necessary they also consider: tran slation of laws, by-laws and procedures that regulate prison sanctions in the United States of America, FR Germany, France, Russia, China and Japan). The Head of the Service for General Af fairs thinks that it would be important for her to get introduces with some European by-law about the provision of the prisoners with different goods that they can procure by their own means; in the way regulated by Law and as it functions in practice. 5)Expectations from the ongoing reform: Treatment Service: Establishment of ascribed parameters, lega lly determined for objective estimation of prisoners' personality, whic h would be implemented during the work of treatment officers with prisoners as well as in proposing change of the category in which the prisoner is (in this way subjectivity that now exists will be avoided) Health Care Service: Improvement of working conditions; Improvement of status of medical staff in Pen itentiary as well as integration of Health Care Service in the system of Public Health care protection; Unification of standards and protocols at medical check of the patients. Security Service: Expects better working conditions 115 9.Analyses, comments................. NARCOTICS Assumption, repeated at each visit, is that among the prisoners there are 70-80% of drug addicts. If the percentage is even 50%, that is a huge number of consumers everyday, even if they were not regularly provided with narcotics. It means that the prison with such a number of consumers is very \u00bbinteresting\u00ab market for every drug dealer. It can be concluded that existence and circula tion of narcotics in Penitentiary is one of the major causes of violence and problematic situati ons in which prisoners and guards come as well as prisoners among themselves, on one side, as one of major generators of corruption. With an aim to prevent this emersion it is necessary to raise on a higher level cooperation between services in Penitentiary and in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Until the amount of uncontrolled narcotics is brought to the lowest possible leve l, even the best re-socialization programs that would be implemented from the moment of prisoners ' admission to Penitentiary (as well as to any other prison) would not give results, from whic h direct outcome is that there would be no influence on the decrease in revert, as one expressed social problem. PRIVILEGES, CORRUPTION The impression of the majority of interviewe d prisoners is that the corruption is much spread and in direct relation with privileges en joyed by a smaller group of prisoners, Members of privileged groups are protected from disciplinary and other punishments. Poorer prisoners who are thus disabled to participate in chain of corrup tion, are being forced to either live in fear from richer but protected or to work\" for them, and on the contrary they risk that something of forbidden things is underlain to them. This bri ngs to disciplinary punish ments when they lose privileges they are supposed to have according to Law. It is a great paradox that people who refuse to cooperate in this way are transferre d to the Department under Special Surveillance where accommodation is much worse than in dormitories. EDUCATION It is necessary to provide the pr isoners with a possibility of education during serving sentence, no matter the fact that the school was burned down during rebellion in 2000. Education, primarily conceives through educative role, while it is not important that it is training for production employment, are an integral part of re-socialization process in sense strengthening of positive personal strength. As well, education conceived in this wa y, as educative-treatment process, increases possibility of adequate integration in th e society after the sentence is served, There is a great interest for education. Du ring our visitors we heard from the prisoners that they would like to get a chance to finish b asic school (4-8 grade), to finish some professional school or craft, or to have possibility to learn foreign languages (English, German) Service of the Department for personalit y examination in the Admission Service considers that a great problem is structuring of prisoners' free time because there is neither possibility for any kind of education nor enough po ssibilities for work of those prisoners that 116would like to work. Lack of possibility to work is also important for the fact because it is one of the factors (interest for prisoners' work) that decide upon their classification or advancement to the following groups.) This Service cannot adequately examine prisone rs' interest for education because it would be necessary that there is possibility of offer of any kind of education firs t. Team of experts from the Admission Service considers that it is necess ary to provide basic education, as well as some kind of skilled education (crafts). With an ai m of post-penal re-socia lization, it would be necessary to establish cooperation among Penitentia ry, Center for Social work and National Employment Service, for the employment of ex-prisoners, which existed in a certain form in 80's of last century. OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES According to gathered information, during day the prisoners spend 30-40 minutes in fresh air. This period is under the minimum of one hour daily intended for physical activities., which is anticipated by numerous international standard s from this area- for example EPR Article 27. Additional problem for the prisoners who serve their sentence in Penite ntiary Ni is that time they spend for shopping in the canteen or phone calls is included in the time for stay in fresh air, which additionally shortens this already short time. It is a paradox that the prisoners who are engaged at work, only for that reason, have less time for stay in fresh air than those who do not work or who do not want to work. On the other hand, according to international standards from this area (EPR- Art. 25) the recommendation is to avoid stay in cells during w hole day with only shorter stay in fresh air. According to EPR, for example, sentenced persons w ould have to spend at least eight hours out of their cells, in different activities, therewith the tim e spent in physical activities is included in this period. When speaking about Penitentiary Ni, regarding this, prisoners accommodated in Department under special surveilla nce are in the most unfavorable position, bearing in mind that they spend literally speaking, day and night with an exclusion of one stay in fresh air, never longer than one hour. This should be born in mind in the light of the fact that persons who are exposed or threatened by informal groups in dormitories are accommodated in Department under Special Surveillance. Practically, real or poten tial victims are accommodated in conditions which are far below the minimum anticipated by international standards, Here, it should be added that the prisone rs accommodated in dormitories out of Department under special surveillance are not in favorable position as well; their daily activities, if not engaged at work, are resumed to watching TV in joint room. WORK WITH PRISONERS Staff does not recognize the need to work additionally with the prisoners who are not visited, or to pay more attention to them; these prisoners are more sensitive than others who have visits. Simply existing possibilities of acting that are not always related to the availability of financial means, are not recognized Preparation of the prisoners for the inclusion in normal life after the completion of sentence is insufficient, is not systemized activity and should not be justified by the lack of law regulations. Limiting factor for the work of treatment service (too many prisoners per one treatment officer) does not exist here. Number of prisoners that are daily released from the prison is not huge, and if treatment officers start working with them 2 or 3 months earlier that would be a burden to a daily schedule of treatment officers. Release plan prepared in advance would be targeted at enabling prisoners adapting to the conditions out of the prison because living 117conditions in the Penitentiary became normal fo r them. This plan should be flexible enough so that it could be individually adjust able to every prisoner's needs. HOUSE RULES, PRISONERS' INFORMING House Rules are visibly posed as long as they are torn apart by the prisoners. It is possible to protect it with a transparent foil which would prolong its duration. From the conversation with the prisoners we learned that their introduction with rights and obligations had been conducted, but not co mpletely, only during their stay in Admission Department. Very small number of prisoners had a chance to get introduced with the House Rules in their dormitories. The consequence of this is that the prisoners get to know the rules of House Rules either from other prisoners on periodical basi s or by the officers after he violates the rule and gets punished for it. If House Rules in written form, in the la nguage understandable for prisoners, were available to them at any time, it would allow th at everyone knows what kind of behavior is allowed or not, in which time frames and under which conditions they could advance from one category in which they are classified to a hi gher one... All these would bring to reduction in committing disciplinary offences and significant rela xation of both prisoners and Penitentiary staff. DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES The importance of disciplinary procedures conducted in the case of prisoner Draganovi (use of instruments of restraint which was not re gistered in medical documentation in appropriate way, primarily), is that, besides direct protection of prisoner's rights, it points to lacks of the system, in sense of insufficiently effective mech anism of Medical Service control. Disciplinary Commission is obviously not qualified to bring decisions related to medical practice in disciplinary procedure, but it can only consider negligence related to organization of work in different departments, in this case medical. Based on the insight in disciplinary procedures in case of prisoner Adamovi 's death (the prisoner suffocated with smoke from the burning matrices while he was tied to bed in a solitary confinement), it is clear that it is necessary to include experts for certain areas (in this case medical) in the work of Disciplinary Commissi on, as consultants. In that way it could be undoubtedly determined whether it is procedural breach of work duties or incompetent work, both in this case and in others. As an example, situation in which the doctor prescribes aspirin instead of insulin, at this moment would be considered as a fulfillment of wo rk duties and would not be subjected to work of Disciplinary Commission because the pro cedure is satisfied/ doctor's duty-prescribed medicine, while the Disciplinary Commission is not concerned whether the prescribed medicine is adequate for given diagnosis. With proper work, and in given case, if the facts are determined in proper way, it can be concluded which one of two competent ministries will be responsible for the failure- in this case Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Health. Regarding the work of Disciplinary Commissi on itself in individual cases, the impression is that circumstances of repeated offence committed by an officer against whom the procedure is conducted are not adequately estimated. The result of this is that the penalties proposed by the commission are pretty soft in comparison to the offence severity. This is specially expressed regarding person who committed vi olation in cases of Draganovi and Adamovi in a very short 118period of time. In connection with that, it is tota lly unclear what was the logic that Disciplinary Commission used, when, for a person involved in both cases, in second disciplinary procedure, recommended minor disciplinary measure in compar ison to the previous one. With an aim to avoid double standards it is necessary to characteri ze repeated offence committed by an officer in the same way as the repeated offence committ ed by the prisoner, i.e. as aggravating circumstances. Disciplinary procedure against the member of Health Care Service, related to death of prisoner Adamovi is legally finalized. We consider that declared penalty in this case (as a cut off in salary in the amount of 15% for the period of three months) is unacceptably soft in comparison to both serious consequences of the negligence itself and to the fact that person, against whom the procedure was conducted, committed serious discip linary offence for two times in a very short period of time. After the comparison of the results of disc iplinary procedures conducted against prisoners and disciplinary procedures conducted against officers, we can say that penal policy is drastically more severe towards the prisoners. From this we can, even indirectly, draw a conclusion about why the prisoners in very small number lodge co mplaints to work of Penitentiary organs. LAW ON EXECUTION OF PRISON SANCTIONS. LAWS Many times during visits the Team wanted to get answers to questions related to how the members of Security Service experience pris oners and how they understand Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions. We tried to determine whether the members of Security Service experience prisoners as persons to whom, by a decision of a court in charge, only the freedom of movement is restricted but not other basic human right s. Received answers to these questions do not convince us that the members of Security Service think in this way. Interviewed members of Security Service consider Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions a law that ascribes maximum of rights that are coming to them during sentence serving. This approach probably influences the lack of need to learn more about international standards and values they lie on and disables them to affirma tively approach any situ ation. Sticking to law exclusively that lists what is forbidden exclud es wide spectrum of possible actions that do not have to be listed down and written like law because th ey don't consider anythi ng that is forbidden and they lie on values. Whit such understandi ng of Law on Execution of Prison Sanctions contents, the purpose of this Law is only partially fulfilled, given in Article 2 of this Law. SERVICES An individual, while doing his/her work, represents the State and what the State considers to be, as it stated in Constitution. That representa tion goes through personal work which is in the structure of one service that exists and implem ent: the purpose of existence of the institution whose part it is; which is one of institutions thr ough which the ministry in charge implements its own purpose of existence in the area for which it is in charge; which is one of the ministries through which the State implements planned ac tivities (short-term, mid-te rm and long-term) by which the idea that gathers citizens who consider the State their own is implemented. Each of those citizens lives their identities and, if worki ng in some institution, represents the state and when having other identity it asks the state to ju stify itself. That is why those employed in different services in the prison have no right to make mistakes. Prisoners represent only themselves, have right to their own choices, out of which, those wrong ones have consequences. During visits we found that by a decision fro m some previous period it is defined that staff from Legal Service don't have reduced service years for retirement, although being in the 119circle every day and very often have face to face conversations with the prisoners, related to the procedures that are complicated themselves and can ca use stressful situations. This is very visible when taking into account that members, for ex ample, of Registry Department have reduced service years for retirement, although, due to the na ture of their work rarely or never enter the circle and directly get in contact with the prisoners Taking into account the specificity of work in prison system, it would be necessary to introduce systematically planned anti-stress programs for the staff in all penitentiary services. It should be not longer than two months between tw o anti-stress treatments. Such a program would comprise individual and group conversations with an expert, breathing exercises, meditation as well as several days long relaxation program, some where in nature out of living place. This program is important because it prevents burni ng syndrome which greatly reduces working ability and productivity. If it already comes to burning , rehabilitation process is long and slow We consider general international ( UN and EU) documents on Human rights as a group of values expressed in legal language that, in some measure, guarantees that values can be protected and implemented. That is why, for in troduction, we asked representatives of different services what they considered under the term valu es, so that we could argument whether it is enough that needed education on human rights is only theoretical or it requires previous sensibilization of those who should be taught about its contents. Under sensibilization we consider introduction of members in the process duri ng which, by distribution of roles, they have possibility to reach certain value through their own experience. The impression is that staff in different services does not mention that too much knowledge and skills are needed for the improvement of that service work. This is possible due to the fact that: (1) they didn't have experience so th at they could be included in planning or at least discussions about what is needed so that somethi ng (service) is improved; (2) because the starting point for such thinking and proposing should be in objective estimation of current lacks in whose implementation the interviewee is involved (3 ) these considerations require dedication to vocation and responsibility for the results; (4) maybe they don't believe that participation in such proposing makes sense, that it is possible to improve something (service) We think that members of different services that are in everyday contact with prisoners lack: knowledge and understanding of European prison regulative; affirmative approach in thinking; understanding that in Serbia there is a gap of 15 years during which the world developed and which has to be overcome, understood and made up for.; exchange of experiences with colleagues from other prisoners in the country, region and European countries, so that they could compare themselves and learn. Conditions of treatment officers' work, identif ied during the greater part of the project course, represent a limiting factor in fulfillment of their legal obligations, not only based on the Law on execution of prison sanctions but as we ll from the obligations that derive from the description of this working position. Insuffici ent number of basic technical means and huge number of prisoners with whom every treatment o fficer works, brings to impossibility to perform the work adequately (14 treatment officers and mainly 1.100 prisoners) Due to conditions in which the treatment offi cers are working now, and which practically disable them to do what they are supposed to, we cannot comment on expert aspect of their work. In normal circumstances that would be an important part of this Report. It is indicative that half of interviewe d treatment officers are satisfied with the organization of the service, which means accepta tion of existing state of matters, which tells about the lack of vision about better possibilities and the way of the work of the service. 120 One of the most serious lacks observed dur ing visits represent insufficient number of Security Service members in comparison to the number of prisoners. It directly influences the security of the guards themselves as well as the secu rity of the prisoners. Guards, due to the feeling of insecurity can react in a hurry by wh at they additionally endanger their own safety, at the same time breaching prisoners' rights. System does not anticipate additional work with ne wly recruited commanders in order to make up for the lack of working experience and qualification for adequate management in crisis situations (additional trainings and group work with more expe rienced members of the Security Service) MECHANISMS OF SERVICES ' WORK CONTROL In this moment, the only mechanisms of control of Medical Service expertise are inspections of Ministry of Health which is, mo st probably, insufficient. At the same time establishment of new system solutions lasts very long and is followed by the resistance of the structures to which it is related. Competent departments in the Ministry of Health should be much more involved in following and control of the work of Medical Serv ice in Penitentiary Ni, not in the way that inspections come in more frequent controls, but th at Medical Service work expertise and ethics in dealing with prisoners are continually checked by suitable methods. With an aim to equalize the prisoners' rights to adequate protection with the rights of other citizens of the Republic of Serbia, it would be necessary to introduce Advocate of pr isoners' rights, in the Penitentiary as well. Mechanism of control of Security Service should guarantee respect and provision of conditions for the accomplishment of prisoners' rights. Control conducted only by the members of Security Service does not guarantee neutrality in relation to the service itself and would be far more efficient if someone from other service or external evaluator was involved in the work. MEMBERS OF ETHNIC, NATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS MINORITIES Relations among the prisoners who belong to different ethnic and religious groups depend on their number: when number of major ity group is approximately equal to others, relations are good. Greatest number of Roma people is poor, so, as a consequence, Roma people are discriminated because they are forced to do jobs for others. When they are engaged at work in Penitentiary, they do the worst jobs that nobody wants to do, which also stands for Roma people who are not prisoners. Interviewees who belong to some of generally accepted religious communities in Serbia (Orthodox, Catholic and Muslim religion) have no objections re garding the respect of their religious rights, no matter they do not practice them , except for fasting. On the other hand, one of interviewees who belongs to a smaller religious gr oup (Adventist) thinks that due to the religion he confesses, he is very often exposed to insults (sectarian or similar) and occasionally to physical violence. That was his answer to the question ask ed by the team member who wanted to know how the prisoner got the bruises under his eyes. Although it was not explicitly said, the impression of the team member was that the pr isoner thinks that some of the possibilities available for other prisoners are not available for hi m. Precisely, he stated that he was rejected for the admission in Drug free ward, with no explanation. 121 It was determined that during 20 07, Muslims were enabled to have meals between sunset and sunrise, during the fast. These prisoners were also enabled to have unlimited phone conversation for Barium. Smaller number of interviewees, em ployed in Penitentiary services, think that there are prejudices towards Muslims and that it is manifest ed by a sort of rough verbal communication. From answers received from the st aff and prisoners, on this sp ecimen, it can be concluded that there are less prejudices toward s Albanians than towards Bosnians. It is noticeable that Albanians from Kosovo ar e in less favorable position in comparison to the Albanians from the South of Serbia, which is the consequence of circumstances outside Penitentiary and is reflected in normal keeping of contacts with the family members. Personal documents of those prisoners' family members expire as the time passes and it is almost certain that they will not ask for the prolongation of th em. On the other hand, personal documents issued by UNMIK are not recognized as valid ones by the competent organs in Serbia, which practically causes that the families of those prisoners from Kosovo are not able to visit them. As the time passes this number will inevitably increase. Albanian prisoners did not contribute to the situation they are in, in any way and are in objectively discriminated position in comparison to other prisoners. Based on the data gathered during the project, it can be concluded, with certainty, that there are many areas in which it can potentially come to discrimination of different minority groups. For example, discrimination can happen in disciplinary procedures, procedure of submitting complaints to officers' practice, informi ng about the rules of behavior in Penitentiary, contact with outer world, participation in joint activities, religious activities, approach to work, availability of health care protection and nutrition regime. Here, discrimination can be induced by the sy stem or by other person, no matter whether we speak about the prisoner or Penitentiary officer. In procedures, problems can emerge due to language or Cyrillic script ignorance, illiteracy or some other differences that derive from nationa l or ethnic identity, i.e. affiliation to a minor religious community. Comprehensiveness of this problem requires detailed work in a longer period of time. Prevailing opinion is that there are guards' prejudices towards prisoners in general, as members of a group that is in status of sentenced for crime, during their stay for sentence serving. As well, there are prejudices related to the type of crime for which some prisoners are in Penitentiary, which is particularly expressed in sexual criminal acts. DISABLED PERSONS Disabled persons are not recognized as a marg inal group about which other evidence, except medical, should be kept., and in this way provide adequate conditions for them. Verdicts of European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg re peatedly point to that it is necessary to take care about special needs that certain categories have, when confining them. As an example, verdict in case Price V Great Britain from 2001, determines that to accommodate a severely disabled person in prison without providing ad ditional facilities may amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. Law that protects disable d persons from discrimination was brought in Serbia in 2007. After recommendation given by Monitoring te am, disabled persons were accommodated on the ground floor of a dormitory, which fac ilitates their everyday functioning. This action represents maximal possible facilitation of disab led persons' position by the management of 122Penitentiary. However, other facilities which are of great importance for these prisoners are still hardly accessible (health service, library, dining room, painting and other sections) We think that it is necessary to architectura lly adjust to disabled persons' needs at least one Penitentiary, for the beginning, in order to enable disabled prisoners to serve the sentence under the same conditions as others. This could serve as a temporary solution only, bearing in mind that disabled persons with residence at longer distance from su ch an adjusted penitentiary, would be additionally brought to hard position in respect of possibilities to contact with family and thus would be discriminated again. It could be said that there is no evidence w hose only purpose is to systematically keep records about the persons with special needs and the needs that derive from that as well as for additional assistance. The data we got is related to prisoners who are, in different ways, temporarily or permanently, not capable of working, for different medical reasons. At the same time, prisoners whose diagnostic procedure is in progress, due to possible disability, are neither recognized as persons freed from work nor as disabled persons. In that sense they are not recognized as persons who need additional assistance and other pers on's care during diagnostic procedure. Since we don't know the number of disabled pers ons, we don't know the types of disability in each particular case, as well as needed individual assistance. Out of this it can be concluded that there is a system lack because disabled persons are not recognized as a category that requires special accommodation and living conditions, by which they would be brought to equal position with other prisoners, i.e. they would not be discriminated. PRISONERS Lack of evidence about the number of illiterate persons could be a problem to treatment officers while planning individual work with each prisoner. In work with illiterate prisoners, it is needed to spend much more time in introducing w ith the contents of House Rules and other rules. The existence of such records would prot ect illiterate prisoners from discrimination We found out from interviewees that illiterate prisoners are forc ed to pay in material goods (cigarettes and similar) to literate ones, writing of different applications, reading of House Rules and similar. In this way, illiterate prisoners ar e discriminated in comparison to literate ones. At the moment, there are 29 (April 2008) registered illiter ate prisoners in Penitentiary Ni, which is not a great number in comparison to total number of prisoners. Prisoners have no possibilities for schooling, change of qualifica tions or additional qualification...they also don't have structured fr ee time. Work of Treatment service is limited by the existing conditions. Society does not cooperate in acceptation of ex-prisoners. So, it is no wonder that percentage of repeated offence is so high (75 - 80%). Prisoners positively react to women that work in Treatment service and describe them as compassionate and more ready to listen to their problems. Our impression is that the prisoners consider as legal acting everything that does not fall into in direct use of force by the Security Serv ice, no matter whether that is in line with law or not. This is, for example, related to a situation where one prisoner sleeps in the room in time when it is not foreseen by House Rules and all th e others from the room get punished by distraint of going out for a walk, which is seen as ascribed by law. 123 Representatives of international Red Cross visite d Penitentiary and Albanian prisoners with whom they talked. They expressed their satisf action with implemented measures of additional security provided for these prisoners, which have been implemented from December 2007, after one of our team's recommendations. During conversations with the prisoners who have been recently injured by officers (according to the files from Medical Service) wh ile using compulsory measures, it was defined that they refuse to talk about the event. It points to: avoiding repeating the trauma through conversation about it; prisoners ha d consequences; or are afraid that they would have some consequences because of reporting it. On the ot her hand it makes relative both optimistic answers that the prisoners have and official data fro m Penitentiary services about the number of cases when compulsory measures were used and small number of recorded use of compulsory measures that resulted in injury. When we asked Is the food tasty?\" one prisone r answered that it was not expected that the food was tasty in the prison. Probably, this sente nce is not adequate to be quoted in the Report of this kind, but there are two possible reasons for it to be here, One is that great number of all interviewees has no clear picture that the pris oner is a person whose fre edom of movement is restricted as a penalty for committed crime, while he keeps right to enjoy all other rights. The other is the necessity of taking care about hum an dimension of everything- reforms, law enforcement, functioning of any system. Poor prisoners are in less favorable position in comparison to others because it is not allowed to bring into prison \u00bbhome made food\u00ab (for example, dairy products). They don't have enough money to buy in the canteen and food fro m the canteen is not adequate substitute for home made one. Reason for ban on bringing in the \u00bbhome-made food\u00ab is potential import of narcotics. In conversations with the prisoners we found out that narcotics are imported through absolutely different channels and that there is no less narcotics in the prison after the ban of home-parcels. At the same time, parcels with hom e made food are the only way that prisoners of weak and bad material status can have more qua litative nutrition and in their own way of nutrition during their stay in Penitentiary. General place in conversation with the pr isoners is that the advancement through categories is not clear and that it greatly depends of something intangible which is in hands of treatment officers. 12410. Recommendations given during the realization of the project Short term: 1) To install or fix (there where they exist) flushing through cisterns (especially in \u00bbC\u00ab Pavilion) (09.07.2007.) 2) Enable the prisoners to get, especially during summer months, together with daily meals, more fresh fruits and vegetables, and more frequently various dairy products (10.08.2007.) 3) To draw a plan on prisoners' schoo ling and education (10.08.2007.) 4) To enable prisoners to take up different cr eative hobbies (for example- photography, pastry making, newspapers publishing, mosaic making- shortly, to be creative) (10.08.2007.) 5) To separate different categories (not only ri sky groups, but much wider: drug consumers from those who do not consume drugs, those sen tenced for war crimes from others, those willing to work, even theoretically from othe r) of prisoners whenever it is possible. (10.08.2007.) 6) To introduce the prisoners with the contents of the rules in adequate and understandable way for them. (10.08.2007.) 7) We suggest considering the possibility to a llow homemade food to be included in the package, which is now forbidden. Backgrounds: Poor prisoners are in unfavorab le position compared to others because homemade food is not allowed (for example- dairy products). They do not have enough money to buy it in the canteen, and food from th e canteen is not adequate supplement for home made food. The reason for such a ban on \u00bbbringing in home made food) is potential delivery of drugs. From the conversation with th e prisoners we found out that the drugs are delivered through absolutely different channels and that there is no less drugs due to the ban (12.10.2007. / 07.12.2007.) 8) To arrange that, in the procedure of giving legal assistance to a prisoner, the conversation between the prisoner and a person from legal department of Penitentiary is really confidential, so without any other, especia lly uniformed person from the Penitentiary. (12.10.2007.) 9) Working section- metal detecting gate on the entr ance/exit of this section is out of order. Recommendation is to fix it (12.10.2007.) 10) To arrange that, among other things, every illiterate person is registered and put in evidence, at the admittance of prisoners (12.10.2007.) 11) It is necessary to consider the provision of ambulance-kit for reanimation, defibrillator as well as an ambulance vehicle- type re-animobile. (12.10.2007./ 07.12.2007.) 12) To increase internal security of Albanian prisoners in the period to come, at least for three months. (07.12.2007.) 13) To introduce special engagement for keepi ng medical documentation that would guarantee completeness and exactness of written in data (07.12.2007.) 14) Bearing in mind latest events it is necessary to install video monitoring of solitary cells, i.e. isolation rooms as soon as possible. This investment presents a minor investment in comparison to the benefit it will bring and problems it will prevent. (07.12.2007.) 15) We recommend setting a practicable mechanism of self-internal evaluation of medical service work success (auto-evaluation) (07.12.2007.) 16) It is necessary to set up a special evidence of disabled persons that would comprise the level of disability and special need in every si ngle case. In order to develop a basic paper form different associations of disabled pe ople should be consu lted. (07.12.2007.) 12517) To provide adequate accommodation for disabled prisoners who are in Penitentiary Ni at the moment, with an aim to fulfill obligations of state organs from the valid RS Law on prohibition of disabled people discrimination. (07.12.2007.) 18) To adjust existing facilities for unmarred acc ess of disabled people to certain pavilions, library, dining room and other facilities to wh ich the access of disabled people would be of a great importance and thus enable them to enjoy equal rights as others (07.12.2007.) 19) Representative of the Ministry for Health Care or Ethical committee of doctors association, depending on the case, should be involved in the work of disciplinary committee during the procedures led against medical staff or those related to medical staff in any other way. (07.12.2007.) 20) With an aim to equalize the right to a medical care of prisoners with rights of other citizens, in line with law, permanent presence of Patients' protector should be provided (07.12.2007.) 21) To completely integrate Health care service of Penitentiary Ni into the system of health care protection on the level of the Republic of Serbia, in sense of strengthening responsibilities of the Ministry of Health Care for the health care of prisoners in general, and in specific for the control of staff expe rtise and quality of giving health services. (07.12.2007.) 22) Bearing in mind specificity of the conditions for providing medical services in Penitentiary Ni (and we believe that is the case in other institutions of this kind), it is necessary to harmonize the work of Ministries for Justice a nd Health Care Protection, in the sense of clear division of engagements and comp etences as well as harmonized activities (Recommendation No R98) 7 of the Committee of SE Ministers that deal with ethical and organizational aspect of health care protection. (07.12.2007.) 23) Doctors who work in medical service shoul d be consulted and involved in making decisions regarding the selection of the mode l (for example- Model of Croatia, Model of Slovenia...) for the treatment of, for example drug addiction diseases, that they will apply later. The doctors should also be provide d with regular information on contemporary achievements in their branch in general, and especially in the area of providing health care to the prisoners. They should also be enable d to exchange experiences periodically with their colleagues from Serbia (engaged in pr isons) and from the countries of the region. (07.12.2007.) 24) To consider, as soon as possible, possibility for ransack (inspection) of all those who enter the closed part as well as daily ransack (inspection) of th e guards (18.01.2008.) 25) Number of the guards on the block should be brought to a level that guarantees higher level of guards' safety as well as prisoners'. (18.01.2008.) 26) To include commander's opinion on prisoners in written form, in the system of evaluation, for the purpose of the promotion through categor ies. Bearing in mind the fact that the commanders are in everyday contact with sentenced persons, more frequently than treatment officer; it enables them to follow up everyday work and behavior of sentenced persons (18.01.2008.) 27) To provide commanders with shorter years of service, with additional different trainings that will enable them to adequately act in cris is situations which they can face in their work. This is the area of interest for both the commanders and prisoners. (18.01.2008.) 28) To consider the possibility of introduci ng additional evidence keeping on housing and social status of the complete staff of Penitentiary Ni and above all, staff of security service, bearing in mind conditions and difficulty of their work. (18.01.2008.) 29) To ensure that all security staff is equa lly and adequately tr ained. (18.01.2008.) 30) To consider the possibility to make an urgent procurement of personal means of communication among the security staff (Motorola and similar) with an aim to enable basic 126communication and to raise the level of security (at the moment they have only three Motorola devices that are not reliable du e to frequent break downs) (18.01.2008.) 31) All the security staff should be provided with (1) additional improvement which would enable them to acquire adequate knowledge and skills and (2) periodical check-ups and reviews of knowledge and skills so that there w ould be real insight into needs and condition of the service as well as to guarantee optimal efficacy of the service (18.01.2008.) 32) Commander's practiced knowledge should be one of the resources when developing a regulative that is related to their work (least when making problem tree\"- a phase of problem analyses) (18.01.2008.) 33) It is necessary and obligatory to fill in the comp lete form/providing legal assistance/ with a typewriter (part that is filled in by officer). (18.01.2008.) 34) During disciplinary procedures it is to avoid that a part concerning provision of legal assistance and other prisoners' basic rights is regulated only by a form, without explicit input into the report by authorized person who leads the procedure. (18.01.2008.) 35) A possibility that disciplinary commission consults and gets opinions on the competence of the staff against whom the disciplinary proce dure is led for the violation of work duty, should be anticipated. This should not be left to be the case for the private complaint of prisoners' families in the cases with death outcome. (18.1.2008.) 36) Disciplinary commission should, in its work on the case with death outcome of the prisoner Dejan Adamovi , take into account the opinion of the competent instance from the Ministry of Health Care and professional ethics of the doctor against whom the procedure is led (besides others), for two reasons: (1) She is still in the disciplinary procedure for the omissions in the case of prisoner Draganovi ; our team follows up this case and will not give any comments about it until the case is finalized; (2) Case of prisoner Adamovi is with a death outcome and is very disturbing for every citizen because it shows that eventual omissions that has resulted in this way can be sanctioned by such a level of penalty that comprises % deduction from the payment. (We are completely aware that disciplinary commission is not a body in charge of criminal procedures, but it can, through its work and expressed responsibility, contribute to the im age of the Penitentiary as an institution capable to carry out the role of the State which guarantees the right to life to a prisoner during the imprisonment.) (18.01.2008.) 37) To provide 1 PC for each employed educator * Faculties are obliged to renew\"computer equipment\"in order to get accreditation, which means that computers can be obtained at relatively law prices. If it is not possible to provide means for the provision of new PC-s , a contact should be made with some of the faculties (Electronic, Law, Mechanical...) on time, and second-hand computers could be bought in this way. (22.02.) 38) To increase the number of engaged treatment officers that work in the treatment service, so that the number of prisoners that each of th em is working with is maximum 40. It would be good if they could be psychologists. (22.02.) 39) To consider possibilities for cooperation with the Faculty of Philosophy (groups: sociology, pedagogy and psychology) and enga gement of students, who would volunteer in the treatment service, as a part of their studies. They could take over at least one part of administrative affairs, without any need to enter the closed part of Penitentiary. It would be an opportunity for the students to practically work in the area of their subjects and at the same time the educators would be re lieved in some way. Eventual obstacle for the engagement of these students could be a daily check which can be solved by everyday inspection of them as well as any other person entering the Penitentiary. Cooperation with the faculty would present a good example of contact and cooperation with local community. Subjects that have a need for such a volunteering, for example, on group Sociology, could be as follows: Social pathology, Social deviations and forms of deviant behavior and 127Social politics. These are professionally applica tive subjects in whose description there is a development of practical skills. Students are pr ovided with a possibility of one-day visit to Penitentiary within the framework of th eir lectures, based on the approval of the Management, which is very interesting fo r them but it does not represent practice. Based on preliminary discussions with subject teachers, students' engagement /individual/ could be organized in the following way: 4 hours/ two times a week/ during a month, one student. First, it would be needed to see the number of volunteers needed, and then, based on that, negotiate\"with the faculty about th e engagement of a sufficient number. We have not checked which subjects on groups Pedagogy and Psychology would have a need for such a practice. In any case, Dean of Facu lty for Philosophy should be contacted and thus start up cooperation, for which we believe, w ould be to mutual benefit as well as to the benefit of Local Community. (22.02.) 40) To anticipate possibility of group work, in the work of treatment officers with the prisoners. Should there be insufficient k nowledge, it should be provided. (22.02.08) 41) To perform technical modernization of Disciplinary commission and Legal Assistance Department by providing two PC computers and a printer (22.02.) 42) To consider a possibility to involve a pers on trained for administrative affairs- recording secretary, in the work of Disciplinary Commission in order to speed up the disciplinary procedure as well as to relieve the member s of the committee from the additional work.

(22.02.) 44) To check every day if there is a House Ru les posed in each pavilion and if any misses it should be replaced by a new one. (22.02.) 45) In order to raise the quality of admittance, inspection and proposal of prisoners' treatment with special needs (suicidal, mental diseases) we consider that Penitentiary should closely collaborate with Psychiatric hospital in Toponica, near Ni, which should be anticipated and covered with adequate budget for that year. So far, for daily needs the prisoners were sent to the Institute for Mental health and for those mo re serious to the Penitentiary Hospital\" in Belgrade which is overcrowded. Psychiatric hospital in Toponica is well organized and has all the resources (material and human) and it has better geographical position in comparison to other institutions that could satisfy the demands (22.02.) 46) To provide adequate space/conditions for s port activities of the prisoners that does not depend on weather conditions.

(04.04.08.) 49) To find a possible solution for employing an efficient number of part-time engaged security officers/ superintendents till the first ge neration of wardens finishes the training (One possible solution is temporarily taking over th e wardens from the various security services). (04.04.08.) 50) To increase the number of the treatment officers. A new part time treatment officer has been employed (04.04.08.) 51)Due to the needs of the medical service it is essential to hire one general practitioner and one analyst technician. A part time practitioner has been employed (04.04.08.) 12852) All currently possible professional training should be enabled for employees in each and every service. Those trainings should not be directly related to the job they are doing; any additional professional knowledge is much favorable. (04.04.08.) 53) Providing the senzibilization in favor of human rights and education on basic EU and UN documents (The Universal declaration on human rights...) for employed in all services. (04.04.08.) 54) Enabling the illiterate prisoners any re gular additional support related to writing submissions and introducing with the House rules and any other re levant documents. (04.04.08.) 55)Taking into account the recording of any means of constraint in dormitories with the purpose of evaluating prevention and decreasing the violence in the most rendered parts of the penitentriary. (04.04.08.) Recommendations for whose implementation is necessary to fulfill the condition that total number of prisoners is equal to or less than 850 1) To provide stay in fresh air to all the pris oners for an hour, excluding time for the canteen and phone calls. 2) To remove third bed from the bunk bed a nd leave only two, one above the other, wherever they are; 3) To enable right to privacy and protection of personal integrity of the prisoners in Increased Supervision Department by setting at least improvised barrier (wooden panel, oilcloth, curtain...) at the existing out let of the entrance to the toilet. 4) To separate different categories (not only risky groups, but much wider: drug consumers from those who do not consume drugs, those sentenced for war crimes from others, those willing to work, even theoretically from other) of prisoners whenever it is possible.

It is necessary to emphasize that there is an already prepared project design for Universal sports hall in Pen itentiary, for which there is no money. It is important due to the fact that practicing sports: - Leads to sublimation of negative energy - Enables qualitative structuring of spare time - Enables persons that live in this kind of c onditions to maintain adequate level of health (07.12.2007. / 18.01.2008.) - Enables creation of qualitative inter-persona l relations (which enables them to move away from the authority of informal groups and their leaders), tolerance to being unsuccessful is developed and a ll this strengthens decisiveness in the accomplishment of set up goals.

(05.05.08.) 133 Instead of conclusion Prisoners with their problems are, during ser ving of the sentence, most often out of the sight and interest of the public. Exceptions are, according to the rule, cases of enough violent or severe incidents that are currently being put in the focus of voyeur media, probably for fun and comfort of wide public. The remaining time, there is a great probability that they will be exposed, in different ways, to violations of their guaranteed rights and that it will be unnoticed. We believe that this is a conclusion related to mo st prisons in the World, while Serbia is not an exception. In order to ensure the respect of prisoners' ri ghts and that their violation is brought to the lowest possible level during sentence serving in Serbia, our opinion is that it is necessary: A/ General - As a priority, to bring to the lowest possibl e level importation of narcotics in the prison. Narcotics are in direct connection with corruption which is a problem that requires a systematical approach. - That the number of prisoners in one prison is adequate for the capacity of that prison and provided for under the standard - To establish cooperation among the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, with an aim to impr ove prisoners' life quality. Cooperation with the Ministry of Internal Affairs is necessary in orde r to prevent smuggling of narcotics intended for the market in the prison. B/ Work with prisoners - To rationalize and implement ge neral prisoners re-soc ialization program, which in its structure anticipates harmonization of each prisoner's treatment according to his/her individual characteristics and needs; General re-socialization program should comprise, besides other things: - Programs of non-violent communication, stress control, takeover of responsibility for oneself and for the society and respect of oneself and others; - To implement, together with prisoners, traini ng programs for qualitatively different life after the completion of the sentence (including education) , supervened by the program of acceptation after the completion of the sentence and possibility of employment; - To structure prisoners' free time, design activities and creative hobbies; - That prisoners' families ate actively included in the process of prisoners' re-socialization. To qualitatively change attitude towards pris oners and to establish ethical standards of employees' behavior in sense of respect of pers onality and prisoners' dignity, which implies: 134- Development of affirmative approach in work, in general, and especially in creating conditions that are as similar as possible to those outside, which is not ascribed by law for it is not forbidden; - Understanding that the prisoner is a person whose freedom of movement is temporarily restricted, as a penalty for committed crime, while other rights are guaranteed to him. - That penalty for the committed crime is in charge of the court and that there is no need and no legal backgrounds for additional punishments, beyond disciplinary measures, by the staff - Exceeding of powers in form of excessive use of force towards the prisoner would have to be treated as an offence not as neglig ence in performing work duties wh ich is penalized by a cut-off in salary; - C/ Prisoners' participation - That the prisoners are actively included in crea ting and deciding about their daily life in prison; D/ Services - To bring the number of employees in services to optimal number, adequate to number of prisoners. - To educate the staff in services about human rights and European laws and recommendations related to prison, and to implement them in ev eryday work, as well as to provide acquiring of additional skills and techniques so that they could apply this knowledge. - That programs of services' work are harmonized and in function of pris oners' re-socialization. E/ Quality of work in services - To develop and implement efficient mechanisms for the control of work within the services; F/ External monitoring - To provide permanent external monitoring of imprisonment conditions; Results of independent external monitoring also give information about possible obstacles whose overcoming should be regulated by sub-legal enact ments, by which conditions for dignified life of prisoners would be created, as well as for the work of officers, which means full respect of prisoners' guaranteed rights by State institutions. We hope that, during the implementation of th is project, we managed to contribute both to direct improvement of imprisonment conditions in Penitentiary Ni and to improvement of system solutions in execution of prison sanctions.
