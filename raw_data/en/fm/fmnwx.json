As you can see, their blood sugar and insulin go up following the meal and as insulin moves glucose into the cells, both steadily fall, taking about four to five hours to digest. Their blood sugar never dips below baseline. The Processed Carbohydrate chart shows the result of either eating a super sweet smoothie, cereal, or muffin, or drinking a cup of coffee with sugar in it. Their blood sugar and insulin levels go up quickly and then crash below baseline within three hours. Now they're experiencing signs of hypoglycemia: bad mood, disorientation, brain fog, even physical shakiness. Some people crash in as little as two hours and this is when they reach for another muffin, cup of coffee, or energy bar \"to bring up their sugar levels\". If our blood sugar starts to rise after eating food, insulin is produced. Our cells are like locked homes and the only way in is with a proper key in the right lock on the cell wall. Glucose cannot leave our bloodstream and enter the cells without that proper key. In this case, the key is insulin. When insulin is produced, a glucose molecule is given an insulin key and together they attach to the lock in the cell wall, opening the door to enter the cell. Once glucose starts to enter the cells and leave the circulation, our blood sugar levels start to decrease again back to normal levels. When we are exposed to increased inflammation, excess toxins or chronic high levels of blood sugar or even drastic fluctuations in sugar levels, over time, the locks into our cells start to become more difficult to unlock. Basically, the locks need more keys and take longer to open. This means that whereas it took only one key to unlock the cell for glucose to enter, we need more keys to do the same job and at a slower rate. This is called insulin resistance. In addition, excess release of insulin due to insulin resistance can then lead to periods of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar after meals as well experiencing blood sugar spikes. These hypoglycemia episodes occur when too much glucose is removed from the blood due to so many insulin \"keys\" being released. Our body overcompensates and moves too much glucose into the cells all of a sudden, leaving us with too little sugar in circulation and symptoms of low blood sugar. Ultimately, even low blood sugar can be a sign of insulin resistance beginning and sugar dysregulation. Overcoming Estrogen Dominance offers practical protocols, recipes and meal plans to help transition to an anti-inflammatory diet, while supporting digestive health and gentle liver detoxification, using food and herbs.

Unfortunately, at this point we only ship to the United States. This is due to the ever-evolving international laws surrounding supplements. There are forwarding companies like MyUS.com, that will forward orders to you in your country for a fee. In this case, it is the customer's responsibility to find out in advance if the supplement in question is legal in their country. For example, Progesterone and DHEA are not legal to ship into Canada (Canada classifies bio-identical hormones as drugs so they can only be prescribed by a doctor or naturopath). We have had customers successfully ship their supplements abroad using MyUS.com, however we have only limited experience with this service. WHY DOES SHIPPING COST $11.45? For small businesses like ours, the shipping fee covers the very real costs of getting your order to you: shipping, handling, packaging, warehousing, insurances, and fairly compensating all the people involved along the way. We do our best to keep this shipping cost as low as possible, and offer FREE shipping for orders $97 and above. WHY DOES MY SUBSCRIPTION ORDER INCLUDE $11.45 SHIPPING? If you set up a subscription order and notice that you are being charged shipping, it could be due to one of these reasons: 1. Your order value is under $97 2. Your initial order qualifies for free shipping, but the order frequency on your subscriptions is different ( 1 product is set to ship every month, the other is set to ship every 2 months). *The system automatically splits this kind of order into 2 separate shipments. In this case it is more economical to set up one subscription every 2 months, and to increase your quantity to 2 units of the supplement that you consume monthly. For example: 2 Vitamin B6 + 1 Essential Omegas every 2 months = free shipping. Please email us at [support@hormonesbalance.com](mailto:support@hormonesbalance.com) if you would like some help managing your subscriptions.
