She has a long-standing interest in human cancers and neurological disorders, with her current research focus on the use of nanotechnology to overcome medical barriers in disease diagnosis and therapy. Dr Liu has been recognised for scientific excellence with several grants, fellowships and awards including 2016 NHMRC Peter Doherty-Australian Biomedical Fellowship, 2015 Women in Technology Rising Star Award and as 2019 finalist for L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO For Women in Science Australian & New Zealand Fellowship for her work in developing nanomedicines for disease diagnosis and treatment. She has a long-standing interest in biology and pathophysiology of human cancers and neurological disorders. Her current research focus is on the use of bio-inspired materials and nanotechnology to generate multifunctional nanostructures to overcome the current medical barriers in disease diagnosis and therapy. Her research is highly productive, leading to 60 original research publications, including 8 first author articles and 15 last/corresponding author articles, in leading in leading journals such as ACS NANO (IF 15.9), Nano Letters (IF 11.2), Biomaterials (IF 12.5), and ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (IF 9.2). She has given 27 presentations at national/international conferences, eight of which were as invited speakers. Dr Liu has attracted significant research funding from various competitive funding agencies with a total of over $2 million. Research focus - Design and synthesis of advanced biomaterials and their applications in cancer therapy and diagnosis, cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment, and neurological disorders treatment. - Mechanisms of iron-related cell death in diseased conditions. - Pathological roles of immune cells exosomes derived from immune cells in cancer and neurological disorders.
