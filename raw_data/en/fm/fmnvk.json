Incidence: The coronavirus disease COVID -19)is caused by a novel coronavirus labelled as SARS -CoV -2. The disease first emerged in December 2019, when a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was recogni sed in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China1. The number of infected cases rapidly increased and spread bey ond China throughout the world. On 30 Janua ry 2020, the WHO declared COVID -19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and thus a pandemic.2 Estimates of SARS -CoV -2 incidence change rapidly . The MAHobtained incidence and prevalence estimates using data from Worldometer, a trusted independent organization that collects COVID -19 data from official reports and publishes current global and country specific statistics online.3 As of 03 January 2023 , the overall number of people who had been infected with SARS -CoV -2 was over 665 million worldwide , 4Table 1shows the incidence and prevalence as of 03 January 2023 for the US, UK, and EU -27 countries. In the EU and the UK, by 03 January 2023 the total number of confirmed cases had accu mulated to 204 million, or 39,879 per 100,000 people. Across 27 countries in the EU, the number of confirmed cases ranged from 16,877 to 63,005 cases per 100,000 people. Romania and Poland reported the lowest incidence rates while France, Slovenia, and Austria reported the highest .4 In the US, the number of confirmed cases had reached over 102 million cases ( 30,671 per 100,000 people) b y03 January + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 26Table 1.Incidence, Prevalence, and Mortality of COVID -19 as of 03 January 2023 - population/#:~:text=7.9%20Billion%20(2022),Nations%20estimates%20elaborated%20by%20Worldometer accessed on 03 January 2023\" The reported numbers refer to cases that have been tested and confirmed to be carry ing the virus and sometimes, depending upon the country , also presumptive, suspect, or probable cases of detected infection . There are large geographic variations in the proportion of the population tested as well as in the quality of reporting across countries. People who carry the virus but remain as ymptomatic are less likel y to be tested and therefore mild cases are likel y underreported.5BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 27Further, as at -home rapid testing kits have become more readily available6and formal testing resources reach capacity due to the Omicron variant, t he true estimate of cases is estimated to be larger than formally reported counts. The numbers should therefore be interpreted with caution.7 The variants from all SARS -CoV -2 specimens sequenced b y the CDC during the week ending 31 December 2022 can be found in Figure 1 below, along with the variant proportions identified from the week ending 01 Octob er through the week ending 31 December 2022.

On 03 Janua ry 2023 , the overall prevalence estimates for the EU and UK were 669and 119 active cases per 100,000, respectivel y.4 The range of reported prevalence for EU -27 was 0 to 6,398 per 100,000 :Greece ,Slovakia andCzech Republic reported the lowest prevalence while , Luxembourg, Poland and Estonia reported the highest (Table 1).It should be noted that Greece reported 0 active cases on 03 January 2023, leading to a prevalence estimate of 0 per 100,000 population. In the US, the prevalence on 03 January 2023 was584 active cases per 100,0004. Demographics of the population in the proposed indication and risk factors for the disease: Since the beginning of the pandemic , the ECDC has continuously collected COVID -19 information from all EU/EEA member states . In the ECDC's TESSy database ,COVID -19 case-based data, including age and gender, are available for over 80% of the official number of cases reported b y ECDC epidemic intelligence9enabling estimates of age and gender distribution representative of the European population.

In a study that anal yzed data from 1,164 sy mptomatic, molecularly confirmed hospitalized (admitted between 5 May 2020 and 19 March 2021) COVID -19 patients from 20 different hospitals across the US, the median age was 59.0 y ears (intra -quartile range 20 y ears) and 61% of the patients were male. The racial/ethnic distribution of the patients was 48% white, 22% black, 5% Asian, 31% Hispanic and 65% non -hispanic.14 An observational, retrospective study examined patients 18 years old with confirmed COVID -19 presenting to the Emergency Departments of 10 hospitals in the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland, predominantl y during the first wave of the pandemic. Those who were not admitted to hospital were a mean age of 51.6 ( \u00b112.8) years old and 51.9% of them were male. Those admitted to hospital were anal yzed separatel y according to whether they survived or not. The mean ages of those admitted were 62.5 (+/ -15.3) y ears and 62.6% were males for those who survived. For those who did not survive, mean age was 71.3 (+/ - 12) y ears and 70.6% were male.15 Another study used data from the Primary Care Sentinel Cohort of the Oxford Roy al College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre database, which is considered to be nationally representative of the English population, to identify COVID -19 cases from 1 March 2020 to 1 April 2021. Overall, the investigators identified 395,680 persons with COVID -19 among the 7,382,775 persons registered in the database. The mean (sd) age of those infected was 44.56 (21.75) y ears; 55.6% of them were female; stribution was 65.1% white, 2.8% Asian, 2.3% other and 21.1% -5 Risk Management June 2023 Page 33As of January 20, 2022, Omicron had been id entified in all EU/EEA countries.17The median age of the 155,150 cases reported to TESSy by EU/EEA countries up to that point was 30 (interquartile range 20 -33) y ears; 7% were aged 60 y ears and above and 50% were male.18 A study using data from 17 of 18 regional health agencies in France examined the demographic characteristics of 468 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant from 23 November 2021 to 11 January 2022. The cases were of a median age of 35 y ears, 55% female, and onl y 16% had pre -existing conditions (hy pertension, obe diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, renal insufficiency , cancer, immunosuppression, liver disease, heart disease, neuromuscular condition, pregnancy , or other condition).18 A study of SARSCoV -2 Omicron variant cases in Denmark used data from the routine Danish surveillance of COVID -19 in which information from several national registries is linked daily . As of 09 December 2021, 785 cases of SARS -CoV -2 Omicron had been regis tered in Denmark. The median age of the cases was 32 y ears (range 2 to 95) and 433 (55%) were male.19 In one US -based study , the mean age and gender distribution of persons infected with the Omicron variant of the COVID 19 virus was similar to that of persons infected with prior strains; the study , conducted using electronic health records from a large community heal th system, examined the outcomes of patients admitted to hospital for COVID -19 infection during 3 time periods: March 2020 -June 2021 (pre -Delta period), 2021 -February 2022 (Omicron period). Patients infecte d had a mean age 57.7, 58.8 and 61.0 y ears for the pre -Delta, Delta and Omicron periods, respectivel y, and were male 51.0%, 53.3% and 50.3 % for the pre -Delta, Delta and Omicron periods, respectivel y.20 A study in South Africa using data from 49 acute care hospitals compared demographic characteristics and outcomes in patients hospitalized for COVID -19 during 4 time periods: 1.June to August 2020 (ancestral COVID -19 variant), 2.November 2020 to January 2021 (Beta variant), 3.May to September 2021 (Delta variant), and 4.(November 15 to December 7, 2021 (Omicron variant). Patients hospitalized during period 4 (Omicron) were y ounger (median age, 36 y ears vs 53 -59 in the prior 3 period s), more likely female (60.8% vs 46.3 -51.8% in prior 3 periods), less likel y to have comorbidities (23.3% vs 52.5 -58.4% in prior 3 periods), and less likely to present with an acute respiratory condition (31.6% vs 72.6 -91.2% in prior 3 periods).21 A similar study in the US used data from a genome sequencing study of SARS -CoV -2 in the Houston Methodist health care s ystem. The authors identified 4468 sy mptomatic patients with inf ections caused b y Omicron from late November 2021 through January 5, 2022. Compared with earlier patients infected with either Alpha or Delta variants in the health care system, Omicron patients were signi cantl y younger, more likel y to be female, and more likely to be African American. Of note, this study found that the Omicron variant was associated with more vaccine breakthrough cases than previous variants of SARS -CoV -2.22BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 34Another similar study described characteristics and outcomes abstracted from the electronic health records of adults aged 18 years admitted to one academic hospital with confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection during periods of Delta (July 15-September 23, 2021) and Omicron predominance (December 21, 2021 -January 27, 2022) in L os Angeles, California. The authors reported that the median age of the patients admitted during the period of Omicron predominance was older ( median 66 v. 60 years, p<0.01) than those admitted during the period of Delta predominance. The proportion of female cases was greater during the Omicron period (48.8% v 44.0%, p=0.15) but females were the slight minority compared with males during both th e Delta and Omicron periods. There was no difference in terms of race/ethnicity during the two periods.23 A CDC study of Omicron transmission within households in 4 US jurisdictions found that age was not related to transmission: Omicron attack rates were high across all ages regardless of vaccination status .24A study of COVID -19 reinfections using Italian national data found that, during the period when Omicron was the dominant strain, those over age 60 had a greater risk of severe reinfection (i.e. severe sy mptoms during a second infection), but the elderl y did not have greater risk for overall reinfections.25In terms of race/ethnicity , a CDC study of 14 states found that during the Omicron -predominant period, peak hospitalization rates among non -Hispanic African American adults were nearl y four times the rate of non - Hispanic White adults and was the highest rate observed among an y racial and eth nic group during the pandemic.26This same 14 -state CDC study found that, compared with the Delta - predominant period, the proportion of unvaccinated hospitalized Afr ican American adults increased during the Omicron -predominant period. An anal ysis of US data from 2020 showed that disease has been much less severe among ages 0 -24 compared to ages 25 y ears, with 2.5% hospitalised, 0.8% admitted to an intensive care unit , and <0.1% d ying among ages 0 -24, versus 16.6% hospitalised, 8.6% intensive care, and 5% d ying among ages 25years.27 Early in the pandemic in the US, approximately 90% of hospitalized cases were over 40 years old, and the majority had been male, although currentl y there is an approximately equal distribution in sex .2829303132 African American COVID -19 patients have been reported to have an increased risk of hospitalisation2933and mortality,34compared to white patients in the United States. A CDC report examined demographic trends among US COVID -19 deaths from May to August of 2020.35During the observation period, the percentage of US COVID -19 deaths that were Hispanic increased from 16.3% in May to 26.4% in August, this was the only racial or ethnic group among whom the percentage of deaths increased during that time. An earlier CDC report on excess deaths covering 26 January 2020 through 03 October 2020 broke down excess deaths by demographics .36By age during that period, the largest increase in deaths compared to average expected deaths occurred among adults aged 25 -44 (26.5% increase) while deaths among people <25 y ears was 2.0% below average during this period . By race, increases in deaths compared to expectation were largest among Hispanics (53.6% increase) , Asian Americans (36.6% increase), BA.1 + BA.4 Plan June 2023 Page 35In a 2021 report, the CDC data on Excess Deaths Associated with COVID -19 reported that deaths in age groups 25 -44, 45 -64, 65 -74, 85 -84, and 85 years exceeded historical numbers from 2015 -2019 .37An increase in deaths can be observed around week 35 that coincided with the wave of Delta variant infections, with the largest num ber of deaths occurring in the 45-64 age group at 16,362 . While research earlier in the pandemic tended to focus on adults, more recent data have given greater attention to children and adolescents. For the period January 01-March 31 ,2021 across 14 states (the most recentl y available data), the CDC's Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network ( COVID -NET )database recorded 204 adolescents aged 12 -17 who were hospitalized for likely primarily COVID-19- related reasons.38 The 204 adolescents were 47.5% male consistent with the COVID case sex distribution across all ages and disproportionately from minorities, with 31.4% Hispanic and 35.8% non -Hispanic African Americans .38 For the period March 7, 2020 -December 24 , 2022, the CDC's COVID -NET database recorded that 6,434 children aged 0 -4 had a positive COVID test proximal to hospital ization and 6,239 children aged 5 -17 had a positive COVID test proximal to hospitalization .39 Another CDC report described demographic trends in US COVI D-19 incidence among 15,068 cases aged 0 -24 years across 16 jurisdictions during the period 01 January 2020 through 31 December 2020.40The report broke down incidence b y age groups and 2020 sub-periods that are presented in Table 4. The table shows that earl y in 2020, 5-9-year-old were experiencing less COVID -19 than 0-4-year-old, but by the end of the y ear this pattern had reversed. Compared to 5-9-year-old, the age c ategories 10 -14, 15 -19, and 20 -24 years old showed progressivel y greater incidence rates, a pattern that held throughout 2020.

BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 39These differences in risk among ethnic groups may be attributed to differences in underl ying factors that are correlated with race/ethnicit y including socioeconomic status, access to health care, and occupation -related virus exposure.49 Children aged 5 -17 typically experience a milder disease course and have lower risk of hospitalization or death .49,58 62Further, among a cohort of children hospitalised with COVID - 19 in the United States from March 2020 to May 2021, infants and children 6 months -4 years of age had a similar risk of severe disease as children ages 12 -17 years.63 Risk of severe or fatal COVID -19 disease is also higher among persons who are current or former smokers, have lower socioeconomic status, have no or public insurance, or live-in neighbourhoods with higher rates of limited English proficiency .37,56 44606465The CDC has also recognised other socio -demographic groups who may need to take extra precautions against COVID -19 due to increased risk for severe illness: pregnant wom en; breastfeeding mothers; people with disabilities or those who are clinically frail ; people with developmental , behavioural or substance abuse disorders; and newly resettled refugee populations.66 Among adults , risk for severe or fatal COVID -19 disease increases with the presence of chronic medical conditions, including obesit y, chroni c lung diseases (e.g., COPD), hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, liver disease, neurological diseases (e.g., stroke or dementia), chronic kidney disease, anaemia, sickle cell disease, immunosuppression, HIV,mycotic infection, vitamin D deficiency higher scores on the WHO Clinical Progression Scale and Charlson Comorbidity Index55,56,60,62,67,68 697071727374 75767778798081 Table 7shows the estimated hazard ratios of COVID -19 mortality associated with these chronic conditions and socio -demographics from a cohort study of 17 million adults (with 17,000 COVID -19-related deaths) in England .68BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 40Table 7.

Admission -specific data elements were acquired via review of electronic medical records at 5 separate time -points over a 28 -day period. The patients' disease severity was assessed at each time -point using a 7 -point ordinal scale (ranging from not hospitalized/no limitations to death) based on World Health Organization and US National Institute of Allergy and Infe ctious Disease severit y scales. Data lock on the survey data was performed on April 7, 2022. The median age was 59 years (interquartile range 20); 711 (61%) were men; the overall mortality was 14%, and 228 (20%) of the patients required invasive mechanic al ventilation. The authors report that risk factors associated with prolonged hospitalization or death b y day 28 included age 65 years, Hispanic ethnicity , elevated baseline creatinine or troponin, baseline ly mphopenia, presence of infiltrate by chest imaging, and high SARS -CoV2 viral load. Survivors were prospectively survey ed for 1 y ear after discharge through quarterl y survey s. Of these 589 completed at least one survey at follow -up. Three hundred five 52% of those completing at least one survey had at least one symptom consistent with PASC, most commonly dyspnoea . Female sex was the only associated risk factor for PASC).14BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 42Another recent stud y by Tsai et al was conducted with the aim to estimate the global risk and risk factors associated with acute respiratory distress sy ndrome among patients with COVI D- 19. The authors performed a s ystematic review, meta -analysis and meta -regression of published studies fr om of patients in hospitals or nursing homes with acute respiratory distress sy ndrome (ARDS) after COVID -19. Study inclusion criteria were: (1) the study provided primary data on the prevalence of ARDS using validated assessment tools or coded medical repo rt data within a population -based study after COVID -19 occurred; (2) patients were diagnosed with COVID -19; and (3) the studies were observational, such as cohort and cross -sectional studies, and were published from 2019 to 2022. A total of 12 studies, conducted in 7 countries (including the US, China, Korea, India, German y, Poland and Greece) were included. Six studies were retrospective three were cross -sectional, two were cohort studies, and one was a prospective study . All 12 studies were conducted with hospitalized patients. A total of 148,080 patients (50.8% male) were studied. The prevalence of ARDS among the studies ranged from 3.6% to 76.4%; the overall pooled risk was 23% (95% CI 14.3 -34.7%) with significant heterogeneity within the 12 studies. Ba sed on the meta -analysis results, significant heterogeneit y was identified among the studies for the risk of ARDS. Therefore, a meta -regression anal ysis was conducted to through the subgroups. Meta -regression reve aled that statistically significant risk factors for ARDS included: age 41 to 64 y ears, fever, multi -lobe involvement on chest X-ray, lymphopenia, mechanical ventilation with oxy gen therap y, European region, and study sample size less than or equal to 500 patients.82 The presence of one or more underl ying medical conditions also increases risk of severe or fatal disease among children aged 5 -17. 838485 In particular, childhood obesity has been consistently associated with two to three tim es the risk of severe disease or hospitalization86 8787and among hospitalized children with CO VID-19 diabetes has been shown to increase the risk of death two -fold compared with those without diabetes.88In addition, children and adolescents with obesit y, hypertension, immunodeficiencies, malignancies, chronic respiratory diseases (cy stic fibrosis, severe asthma etc.), and other chronic diseases are more susceptible to developing severe disease.89For many other individual comorbid conditions, paediatric sample sizes are very small and differe nt studies produce conflicting results, so it is difficult to estimate precise risk ratios based on current literature.58,84 Several studies have examined the risk factors for infection with the Omicron variant and outcomes of the disease. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) investigated the effectiveness of Omicron household transmission prevention strategies during November 2021 to February 2022. Persons with confirmed Omicron infection and their household contacts were interviewed. Omicron transmission occurred in 124 (67.8%) of 183 households. Among 431 household contacts of index Omicron cases, 227 were classified as having a case of COVID -19 (attack rate [AR] = 52.7%). The AR was lower among household contacts of index patients wh o isolated compared with those of index patients who did not isolate (41.2% vs 67.5%, respectivel y; p <0.01). Similarly , the AR was lower among household contacts of index patients who ever wore a mask at home during potentially infectious period (88 of 2 23) compared with those of index patients who never wore a mask at home (39.5%, vs 68.9% BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + June 2023 Page 43respectivel y; p<0.01).24The study also found that age was not a risk factor for Omicron transmission, as attack rates we re high across all ages.24 A study of COVID -19 reinfections using Italian national data from August 2021 through March 2022 (periods of Delta and Omicron predominance) found that, for all variants, the strongest risk factor for reinfection , but not severe reinfection, was being unvaccinated (close to 3-fold) compared to those who were vaccinated for 120 day s; the risk of reinfection was highest during Omicron regardless of vaccination status. Unvaccinat ed was defined as never received a dose or <14 day s from 1st dose. Vaccinated was defined as at least 1 dose and 14 day s. Reinfections were defined as infection 90 day s after 1st infection .25Having been vaccinated more than 120 day s ago was also correlated with a gr eater risk of reinfection, presumabl y due to vaccine efficacy waning over time. Strikingly, reinfection with Omicron was 18 times the risk of reinfection with Delta regardless of vaccination status; however, severe reinfections with Omicron were onl y 0.37 times the risk of reinfection with Delta. In addition to risks of overall reinfections, the Italian study also looked at severe reinfections, that is, second infections in which the sy mptoms are severe. They found that being over 60 years old, and having had a severe first infection, were risk factors for a severe reinfection. We cannot exclude the possibility that some reinfections in the unvaccinated group are in individuals within 14 day s of their 1st dose, known to be a susceptible period. A CDC study of adults in 14 states found some evidence that race/ethnicity may have been a risk factor for COVID -19-related hospitalization during the Omicron -predominant period. The authors reported that peak hospitalization for any diagnosis in patients who tested positive during that time among non -Hispanic African American adults were nearl y four times the rate of non -Hispanic White adults and was the highest rate observed among an y racial and ethnic group during the pandemic.26 In this study , unvaccinated was defined as receiving no doses of vaccine. This same 14 -state CDC study found that, compared with the Delta -predominant period, the proportion of unvaccinated hospitalized African American adults in creased during the Omicron -predominant period. US FDA approved or authorized treatment options Through January 2023 , other COVID -19 vaccines were authorized and recommended for use in the United States including vaccines from Moderna (NCT04470427), and Jo hnson & Johnson/Janssen (NCT04505722). Others may subsequently be approved.

Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including mortality and morbidity: Symptoms of COVID -19 Symptoms of COVID -19 infection can range from very mild (or no s ymptoms) to severe or fatal.93949596The most common sy mptoms for sy mptomatic infected persons are fever, dry cough, and fatigue; upper respiratory tract s ymptoms can include phary ngalgia, headaches, and my algia.44 Current data indicate that about 80% of COVID -19 patients are asymptomatic or have mild -to-moderate s ymptom s, while about 15% develop more severe disease requiring hospitalization and about 5% require ventilation support.44 In addition, 10-20% of COVID -19-infected persons experience persistent or new s ymptoms for periods of weeks to years.44 The rate of as ymptomatic infection decreases with increasing age and long -term care facilities are associated with a lower rate of as ymptomatic infection when compared to household transmission or other healthcare facilities.96The most common sy mptoms of COVID -19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath for both children and adults (Table 9).97 98However, it has been noted that in older people, COVID -19 clinical presentation is extremely heterogeneous and at ypical signs and symptoms such as h yporexia / apy rexia, confusion, delirium, and pre -syncope / sy ncope are more common than in middle -aged and younger persons.99A recent meta -analy sis has estimated that 46.7% of infections in children are as ymptomatic, while a recent s ystematic review that examined 1,140 cases of COVID -19 in children from 23 published studies found that 11% of cases were asymptomatic. Among symptoms, fever was reported in 48%, cough 37%, any nasophary ngeal s ymptom 22%.100 In a more recent meta -analy sis of 32 studies that provided information about COVI D-19 infection in paediatric patie nts the proportions with specific s ymptoms were BA.1 + BNT162b2 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 47Table 9.Signs and Symptoms among 291 Paediatric (age <18 years) and 10,944 Adult (age 18 -64 years) Patientsawith laboratory confirmed COVID -19 \u2014United States, February 12 -April 2, 2020 No. (%) with sign/symptom Sign/Symptom Paediatric Adult Fever, cough, or shortness of breathb213 (73) 10,167 (93) Feverc163 (56) 7,794 (71) Cough 158 (54) 8,775 (80) Shortness of breath 39 (13) 4,674 (43) Myalgia 66 (23) 6,713 (61) Runny nosed21 (7.2) 757 (6.9) Sore throat 71 (24) 3,795 (35) Headache 81 (28) 6,335 (58) Nausea/Vomiting 31 (11) 1,746 (16) Abdominal paind17 (5.8) 1,329 (12) Diarrhea 37 (13) 3,353 (31) a.Cases were included in the denominator if they had a known symptom status for fever, cough, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhoea .

Among the first 43 cases of Omicron identified in the US between December 1 -8, 2021, 93% were s ymptomatic. The initial signs and symptoms reported were cough (89%), fatigue (65%), congestion or runny nose (59%), fever (38%), nausea or vomiting (22%), shortness o f breath or difficulty breathing (16%), diarrhoea (11%), and loss of taste or smell (8%).102In a recent stud y of 338 cases in the Omicron period and 441 cases in the Delta comparator period, there was a decreased prevalence of self -reported loss of taste during the Omicron period (26.9% v. 57.4%, p<0.001).103 Although the majority of the 486 earliest cases of Omicron in France were sy mptomatic (89%), cases only reported mild sy mptoms that lasted a median of 4 day s (IQR 2 -7).18 The most common sy mptoms in hospitalized patients are fever (42-80%), shortness of breath (35-71%), fatigue (33 -62%), experience gustatory disorders (44%) and olfactory disorders (53%).108 Patients hospitalized in South Africa during the Omicron wav e were less likely to present with an acute respiratory condition than in previous waves of the pandemic (31.6% v. 72.6 -91.2%, p<0.001).21Of note, among the 971 patients admitt ed during the Omicron wave 24.2% were vaccinated, 66.4% were unvaccinated, and vaccination status was unknown for 9.4%.21 Among non -hospitalised children < 18 years of age, 89% experienced one or more ty pical s ymptoms of COVID, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and 22% experienced all three .105 Approximately 17% to 40% of those hospitalised with necessitating children hospitalised experiencing severe that + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 48invasive ventilation or ends in death. Risk factors for severe COVID -19 in hospitalised children include presence of a comorbid condition, y ounger age, and male sex.42,104 More than 75% of patients hospitalised with COVI D-19 require supplemental oxygen.109 In their review of COVID -19 infection in children before and after Delta and Omicron variants, Khemiri et al report that the signs and s ymptoms of infection observed in paediatric patients with Delta and Omicron variants are the same as those observed in children infected before the emergence of these variants. 110 Progression and Timeline of Mild to Moderate Disease Mild to moderate disease is defined as the absence of viral pneumonia and hy poxia. For those who develop s ymptoms, the incubation period is usually 4 to 5 day s, with 97.5% experiencing s ymptoms wi thin 11 day s of exposure.111 112The average time from exposure to diagnos is was 3.7 day s among 107 close contacts of Omicron -positive case patients, with 70% being diagnosed b y 5 day s, and 99.1% being diagnosed by 10 day s.113Those with mild COVID -19 recover at home with supportive care and guidance to self -isolate. Those with moderate disease are monitored at home and are sometimes recommended to be hospitalised if conditions worsen -. Data on rates of re -infection are limited but variants may lead to increased risk of re -infection in the future.100,111,114 Progression and Timeline of Severe Disease Requiring Hospitalisation Those with severe disease will require hospitalisation to manage their illness. Based on data that have been sy stematically collected for the entire US by the CDC between 01 August 2020 and 02 January 2023 , there were 5,797,528 new hospital admissions for patients who tested positive for COVID -19 in the US.115For the 50th week of 2022, 7.6per 100 000 population (country range: 1.3-19.5) were hospitalised due to COVID -19 in 14 countries of the EU/EEA with available data.116 As of 24 March 2022, 0.1 -1.5% of children who tested positive for COVID -19 have been hospitalized (for any diagnosis) based on data reported from 25 states and New York City reporting, and 0.00% -0.01% of children with COVI D-19 have died based on data r eported from 46 states, New York City , Puerto Rico and Guam . Between 01 August 2020 and 02 January 2023, the CDC reports 175,603 total hospital admissions for patients with confirmed COVID -19 in the US for those 0 -17 years of age.115 Studies early in the pandemic demonstrated that time from onset of illness to ARDS was 8 - 12days and time from onset of illness to I CU admission was 9.5 -12 day s.111 In 9countries of the EU/EEA with available data, 0. 5 per 100 000 population (country range: 0. 1-1.3) were in the I CU due to COVID -19 during Week 49 2022.116 A meta -analy sis found that, of patients <19 y ears of age, 11% went to the ICU, non -invasive ventilation was administered among 12%, and 4% required mechanical ventilation.94 A study of 82 cases in three paediatric hospitals noted that older children and those with higher bod y mass index or multiple comorbidities were more likely to receive respiratory support.117 A large number of patient characteristics (demographic/personal, comorbid conditions, complications of COVID) have been identified as being risk factors of severe COVID, or death from COVID (Table 10).BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 49Table 10.Factors associated with severe disease in those with COVID -19 Dem ographic Characteristics Com orbid Conditions Complications of COVID -19 Male gender 118 60,68 501461 Older age 118 58,68,84 118 6014 Ethnic minorities 60,62,68,84 14 Lower socioeconomic status 6860 Obesity 37,58,68,84 60777069737444 Smoking 65607664 Blood group type A 5453Disability/clinical frailty/worse scores on health/comorbidity scales 60,84 119 Cardiovascular disease 7744 Hypertension 118 118 60120 76717372 44 Dyslipidemia diseases / asthma 767714 Diabetes/higher hemoglobin a1c level 118 118 60120 120 68,84 120 76 Liver disease 6884,120 767575 Neurological diseases (e.g., stroke or dementia) 58,68,84 60120 77 Chronic kidney disease or failure/ elevated baseline creatinine 58,60,68,84 120 771444 Autoimmune disease 60,68 77 Immunosuppression/immune compromised 6881,84 60 Organ transplant 688476 Mycotic infection 120 79 HIV 84 Sickle cell disease 84 Vitamin D deficiency 6980 Certain genetic polymorphisms 121 5252Cardiac injury/elevated troponin circulating total iron banding capacity126 Higher serum ferritin levels126 Presence of infiltrate by chest imaging 1478 High SARS -CoV2 viral load 14 Risk Factors for Severe Disease and Poor Outcomes Associated with COVID -19 Variants Recent studies have been published to identify risk factors for hospitalization with variants and according to vaccination status. One such study was conducted by the USCDC using data from COVID -NET, which conducts population -based surveillance for laboratory - confirmed COVID -19associated hospitalizations in 99 counties across 14 st ates. The authors examined COVID -19associated hospitalization rates among adults aged 18 years during B.1.617.2 (Delta; July 1-December 18, 2021; 829 cases) variant predominance, overall and by race/ethnicity and vaccination status. Vaccination status was identified using state immunization sy stems data and included the following statuses: unvaccinated, receipt of a primary series onl y, or receipt of a primary series plus a booster or addi tional dose. Hospitalization rates during peak Omicron circulation (January 2022) among unvaccinated adults remained 12 times the rates among vaccinated adults who received booster or additional doses (528.2 v. 45.0 per 100,000) and four times the rates am ong adults who received a primary series, but no booster or additional dose (528.2 v. 133.5 per 100,000). The rate among adults who received a primary series, but no booster or additional dose, was three times the rate among adults who received a booster or additional dose (133.5 v. 45.0 per 100,000). BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BA.4 June 2023 Page 50During the Omicron -predominant period, peak hospitalization rates among non -Hispanic Black (Black) adults were nearl y four times the rate of non -Hispanic White (White) adults and was the highest rate obser ved among any racial and ethnic group during the pandemic.26 A second stud y by the Los Angeles County (LAC) Department of Public Health was done b y a cross -sectional anal ysis of LAC residents aged 18 years with laboratory -confirmed SARS - CoV -2 infection during November 7, 2021 ,to January 8, 2022. Vaccination status was identified using a matching algorithm that links cases to immunization records. Of 422,966 reported SARS -CoV -2 infections in LAC residents aged 18 years, 33.6% (n=141,928) were in unvaccinated persons, 13.3% (n=56,185) were in fully vaccinated persons with a booster (considered fully vaccinated with a booster 14 day s after booster) and 53.2% (n=224,853) were in full y vaccinated persons without a booster ( 14 day s after primary series). Hospital admissions for an y reason 14daysafter 1st lab -confirmed positive test were identified. Unvaccinated persons were more likel y to be hosp italized, admitted to an ICU, require intubation for mechanical ventilation, or to die compared with persons who were fully vaccinated with a booster and those fully vaccinated without a booster. Sequencing data were available for 1 -18% of specimens durin g the Omicron period. During the period of Omicron predominance (week ending January 8, 2022), 2.8% of unvaccinated people, 1.0% of fully vaccinated without booster, and 0.7% of fully vaccinated with booster were hospitalized. Unvaccinated persons had in fection and hospitalization rates 3.6 and 23.0 times, respectivel y, those of fully vaccinated persons with a booster and 2.0 and 5.3 times, respectivel y, higher than those of fully vaccinated persons without a booster.127 Several international studies have examined the risk of serious disease or death associated with variants of the COVID virus. Chen at al conducted a multicenter observational study during the 2022 Omicron wave in Shanghai, China to examine the prognosis of infection with the Omicron variant among hospitalized patients who were \"fragile\" or who had \"h igh- risk\" comorbidities. Enrolled subjects were adults with confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection b y real-time PCR between 20 March and 10 May 2022. The primary outcome was progression to severe or critical disease consistent with WHO guidelines (Severe disease : one or more of oxygen saturation <93% on room air, signs of pneumonia, and signs of severe respiratory distress; critical disease: acute respiratory distress sy ndrome, sepsis, septic shock, or other conditions that would normally require the provision of life-sustaining therapies). The study population consisted of 847 patients, of whom 30.3% were age >70 years, 55.8% were not fully vaccinated, and 65.4% had at least one comorbidity (the five most common being 34% heart conditions, 18.5% metabolic disease , 18.4% 17.1% isolated hy pertension, and 12.5% cancer. A history of being bed -ridden long term was noted in 18.7%. The overall rate for severe and critical cases was 11%. Multivariate anal ysis showed that comorbidit ies of CKD stage 4 -5, cancer, and long -term bedridden history were risk factors for progression to severe or critical disease, whereas female sex, and fully /booster vaccinated were protective against progression to severe or critical disease .120 A study conducted in South Africa aimed to assess the clinical severit y of COVID -19 in patients admitted to hospital with laborat ory-confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection during the Omicron, Asp614Gl y mutation, Beta variant, and Delta variant waves using data from an active surveillance program established specifically for COVID -19.128Included patients had COVID -19 symptoms, were admitted for isolation, acquired nosocomial + BNT162b2 BA.1 + Risk Plan June 2023 Page 51infection, or tested positive incidentall y when admitted for other reasons from March 5, 2020, to Jan 22, 2022. Severe COVID -19 disease was defined as one or more of development of acute respiratory distress sy ndrome, receipt of oxy gen or invasive mechanical ventilation, or treatment in high -care or intensive -care units. In patients with known clinical ou tcomes, 52.3% in the Asp614Gly wave, 63.4% in the Beta wave, and 63.0% in the Delta wave met the criteria for severe disease, compared with 33.6% in the Omicron wave (p<0\u00b70001). The proportion of patients requiring supplemental ox ygen and the median lengt h of hospital stay was also lower in the Omicron wave than in the other three waves (p<0\u00b70001 for each comparison). The in -hospital case -fatality ratio during the Omicron wave was 10.7 %, compared with 21.5% during the Asp614Gly wave, 28\u00b7.8% during the Beta wave, and 26.4% during the Delta wave (p<0\u00b70001). On multivariable anal ysis, compared with those admitted to hospital in the Omicron wave, patients were more likely to have severe disease if they were admitted to hospital in the other 3 waves. Other fact ors associated with severe disease in this patient population were older age, being male, being Indian (compared with being White), presence of a comorbidity , and the province of hospital admission.128 With respect to the p aediatric population and variant disease, in the South African stud y mentioned above128children and adolescents (<20 years) constituted 14.3% of total hospital admissions in the Omicron wave, compared with 3.3% in the Asp614Gly wave, 3.0% in the Beta wave, and 5.5% in the Delta wave. In children <5 y ears, the proportion of laboratory - confirmed cases admitted during the Omicron wave was higher than in the other 3 waves (25.4% in Omicron vs 12.9%, 15.1% and 14.7% in the Asp614Gly , Beta, and Delta waves, respectivel y). In children and adolescents 5 -19 years, the proportion of laboratory -confirmed cases admitted during the Omicron wave was also higher than in the other 3 waves (5.7% in Omicron vs 3.7%, 2.7% and 2.3% in the Asp614Gly , Beta, and Delta waves, respectively ). However, the proportion of children and adolescents admitted to hospital who re ceived supplemental ox ygen, were treated in intensive care, or had severe disease was lower in the Omicron wave than in the other three waves.128 In their review of COVID -19 infection in children before and after Delta and Omicron variants, Khemiri et al report that these variants affected a large proportion of the y ounger population with presenting signs and sy mptoms generall y similar to the origin al virus. After the emergence of the Delta and Omicron variants the available information reported high hospitalization rates among children; nevertheless, clinical outcomes were similar or less severe compared to those in children infected before the eme rgence of these variants.110 In South Africa, significantly fewer hospitalized patients required ox ygen therap y, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care during the Omicron wave than in previous waves of the pandemic.21When compared to those who were hospitalized with the Delta variant (4,852 hospitalizations between July 1, 2021 -December 18, 2021), those hospitalized with Omicron D ecember 19, 2021 -January 31, 2022) had a shorter length of stay (median 4 day s v. 5 day s, p<0.001), were less likel y to be admitted to the I CU (16.8% v. 24.2%, p<0.001) and were less likel y receive invasive mechanical ventilation (7.6% v. 13.6%, p<0.001 ), based on BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 52Mortality According to a 2020 meta -analysis of paediatric studies published through October 2020, the mortality for paediatric patients 0.1-2%.27,94In a study from January through June 2020 using the National Child Mortal ity Database (NCMD) in England, 5.7% of 437 children 0 -17 years of age who died were SARS -CoV -2 PCR -positive and those who died of COVID -19 were older and were more likely to be non -White ethnicity .129 Mortality data are presented from Worldomete r, an independent organisation that publishes current, reliable COVID -19 statistics online.3The mortality of SARS -CoV -2 infection is defined as th e cumulative number of deaths among detected cases. In the US, as of 03 January 2023 , the mortality was 1,118,484 deaths ( 334 per 100,000 people). Mortalit y in the US was higher than that of the UK ( 290 per 100,00 0).4 Overall reported mortality among hospitalised COVID -19 patients varies from 12. 8% to 26% in the EU , US and UK.33,35 130 131 Mortality rates are declining over time, presumabl y due to an improved understanding of COVID -19 and its management.132In the US, patients hospitalized with the Omicron variant were less likely to die in the hospital than those with the Delta variant (7.0% v. 12.6%, p<0.001).26 Two recent publications (published prior to availability of the vaccine) describe efforts to develop models to predict mortality of patients with COVID -19. The first, by Vagliano et al, described and validated a predictive model, using dat a from electronic health records, for in - hospital mortality of 972 COVID -19 patients admitted between 15February 2020 and 1st January 2021 to the intensive care units of 19 hospitals during two different waves of the pandemic. In total 322 patients (33.1 %) died during their hospital stay . Survivors were significantl y younger (61.0 vs 68.2 y ears) and were less often males (69.8 % vs 77.6 %) than non-survivors. The strongest risk factors for mortality in the final model were older age, higher average fraction of inspired ox ygen in the first 24 hours of admission, and higher maximum glucose in the first 24 hours of admission. A low er estimated glomerular filtration rate in first 24 hours of admission and higher neutrophil count in the first 24 hours of admission were other important risk factors for death .133 The second, b y Sozio et al, was an observational, retrospective stud y that examined patients 18 years old with confirmed (by real-time reverse -transcription PCR )COVID -19 presenting to the Emergency Departments of 10 hospitals in the United Kingdom, I taly, Spain ,and Switzerland, predominantly during the first wave of the pandemic. The individual probability of being discharged directly from ED or of being admitted to hospital, with or without risk of mortality due to COVID -19, was estimated with several different implementations of machine learning models based on multiclass random forest classifiers. Analy sis of Variance testing was performed according to admission and outcome status (not admitted, ad mitted and survived, admitted and died). Those patients who were admitted and died were older, more likely male, had higher serum creatinine levels, had lower platelet counts, had higher levels of mid -regional pro -adrenomedullin (MR -proADM; an inflammatory biomarker that improves the prognostic assessment of patients with sepsis, septic shock and organ failure), higher white blood cell counts, lower ly mphocy te counts, higher Plan June 2023 Page 53and D -dimer levels, and more often had comorbidities includ ing cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hy pertension, and malignancy . The most important predictors of admission and death were in order of strength: MR - proADM, age, LDH level CRP level, WBC count and platelet co unt. The authors presented a decision tree to facilitate interpretation of the most important interactions captured by the random forest classifier, in which age represents the predominant risk factor in determining the need for hospitalization, which is f urther enhanced b y the patient's levels of MR - proADM and CRP.15 Complications of COVID -19 and Long -COV ID Complications of COVID -19 include impaired function of the heart /cardiovascular s 145146 Complications affecting the heart/ cardiovascular sy stem that have been observed include acute m yocardial injury , hypertension, and right ventricular d ysfunction.135One recent review reports that the proportions of patients experiencing some of these complications are as follows: cardiac dy srhythmias in 17 to 44%, cardiac injury with increases in blood troponin in 22 to 40%, my ocarditis in 2 to 7%, heart failure in 4 to 21%, and thromboembolic events in 15 to 39%.136Another recent review indicates that injury to the my ocardium has been reported in up to 30% of hospitalized COVID -19 pati ents and up to 55% in those with pre -existing cardiovascular disease.137In addition, it has been reported that long -term follow -up of Covid -19 patients has revealed increased incidence of arrhy thmia, heart failure, acute coron ary syndrome, right ventricular and my ocardial fibrosis.135 Neurologic complications of Cov id-19 infection have also been extensively studied. Dimitriadis et al examined neurologic manifestations in critically ill Covid -19 patients in a prospective, multicenter, observational registry study of such patients admitted to 19 German ICUs between A pril 2020 and September 2021. During the stud y period, among the 15 ICUs that reported a total of 2681 admissions, 340 patients (12.7%) developed neurologic manifestations, the most common being encephalopathy (including delirium, disorder of consciousness , hypoxic encephalopath y, encephalopathy not further described), thrombosis, microbleeds, subdural -Barr\u00e9 s yndrome, myasthenia, m yositis).138 A meta -analy sis on the incidence of seizures among Covid -19 patients b y Hussaini et al included a total of 11,526 patients from 21 published articles. A total of 255 (2.2%; 95% CI 0.05-0.24, p < 0.01) patients presented with seizures as the first manifestation of COVID -19. Only 71 of the 255 patients had previously been diagnosed with epileps y.139BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Plan June 2023 Page 54There are also psy chological complications of Covid -19 infection. Khraisat et al conducted a meta -analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence of mental disorders among COVID -19 survivors. The anal ysis included 27 studie s with a total sample size of 9605 Covid -19 survivors. The prevalence rates (95% CI) for ps ychological complications were as follows: overall psy chological distress 36% (22 -51%), post 22% -27%), ychologi 36% (22 - 51%), depression 21% (16 -28%), and sleeping disorders 35% (29 -41%).147 Also, a recent narrative review of the literature on post-acute neurologic sequelae of COVID -19 indicates that common conditions include persistent fatigue, headaches, \"brain fog\", depression, and anxiety .148 Shih et al report that patient s with COVID -19 can have GI and hepatobiliary manifestations, which are often mild and transient, although they can occasionall y be severe. The most common consequential GI manifestation is ischemic enterocolitis. Abnormal liver chemistries occur in 14 -53% of Covid -19 patients, both at admission and during hospitalization. Ty picall y, liver function test elevations are mild and recover without specific treatment. Rarel y patients with COVI D-19 may present with acute liver failure, develop primary liver dis ease during their illness, or develop post -COVID -19 cholangiopathy (a form of secondary sclerosing cholangitis) .140 Mallhi et al performed a review of 42 published systematic reviews on Covid -associated acute kidney injury (CAKI). They foun d that the incidence of CAKI ranged from 4.3% to 36.4% overall among COVID -19 patients, 36% -50% in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), and up to 53% in patients with severe or critical illness.141 Matsumoto and Prowle in their review of the literature on CAKI report that large observational studies and meta -analyses report an AKI incidence of 28 -34% in all inpatients and 46 -77% in patients admitted to the ICU. The majorit y of survivors recovered their kidney function b y hospital discharge; however, they remained at increased risk of future AKI, a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and chronic kidney disease. Moreover, even in the absence of overt AKI a significant proportion of survivors of COVID -19 hospitalisation had reduced eGFR on follow -up.142 The risk of new onset diabetes mellitus was reported to be 66% (95% CI 1.38; 2.00) higher among survivors of COVID -19 compared with controls in a meta -analysis of eight studies consisting of 4,270,747 COVID -19 patients and 43,203,759 controls. 143 Other complications of COVID -19 include hemoly tic anemia ,149endocrine disorders (including parathy or ne w-onset fatigue, my algia, arthralgia, arthritis, muscle weakness ,152opportunistic infections ,81and adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm labour and caesarean delivery without any intrauterine infection, and severe neonatal asphy xia.153 A recent narrative review of coagulopath yassociated with Covid -19 infection indicates thrombosis occurs as a result of the virus invading endothelial cells causing local complement activation and inflammation which leads to microvascular thrombi June 2023 Page 55and arterial), which may eventuall y lead to widespread macrovascular thrombotic injury and in some cases end -organ failure.145 Based on a meta -analysis of 42 studies, the risk of thromboembolism was 21% overall and 31% in the I CU, with the pooled odds of mortality being 74% higher among those who experienced thromboembolism compared to those who did not.154 Complications of COVID -19 in pediatric populations In children, multisy stem inflammatory syndrome has been observed to be temporally associated with COVID -19 infection and often develop a rash following resolution of COVID -19.94155156 Complications include coronary artery aneury sms, cardiac d ysfunction, and multiorgan inflammatory manifestations with similarities to Kawasaki disease and other inflammatory conditions. Neonates born to mothers with SARS -CoV -2 infection during pregnancy have also demonstrated a multisy stem inflammatory syndrome with raised inflammatory markers and multi -organ d ysfunction, especiall y of the heart.157 As of 03 January 2023 there were 9,333 cases of MI S-C reported to health departments in the United States with 76 deaths reported among tho se who met the MIS -C case definition.158 Additional sy mptoms of MI S-C include abdominal pain, bloodshot ey es, chest tightness or pain, diarrhoea, lethargy , headache, low blood pressure, neck pain, and vomiting.159 A recent narrative review of thromboembolic events (TEs) as complications of COVID -19 in children used data from 62 studies, describing 138 patients. Venous TEs represented the majority (54%), followed by the venous TEs group, pulmonary embolism was the most frequent, followed by deep venous thrombosis, central venous sinus thrombosis, systematic review with meta -analy sis of four studies to determine the incidence of thrombotic events in children and adolescent patients with COVID -19 infection reported that among 1,128 COVID -19 positive pediatric patients , nearly half of them developed inflammatory sequelae and 7.35% had thrombotic events.161 Recent studies have also shown that paediatric patients with COVI D-19 are at increased risk of diabetes mellitus, particularl y in the 30 days after their COVID -19 infection.162163 Complications of Long -Covid COVID -19 symptoms can persist weeks or months bey ond the acute infection.164165 The NICE guideline scope published on 30 October 2020 defined \"Long COVID\" signs and symptoms that continue or develop after acute COVID 19. It includes both ongoing symptomatic COVID 19 (from 4 to 12 weeks) and postCOVID19 s yndrome (12 weeks or more and for which signs and sy mptoms are not explained by an alternative diagnosis).166 A meta -analy sis of 31 studies published until September 17, 2020 prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant among patients between 18 to 49 y ears of age found that COVID -19 symptoms were experienced for 14 day s to 3 months post -infection, including persistent fatigue (39 -73%), breathlessness (39 -74%), decrease in quality of life (44 -69%), impaired pulmonary function, abnormal CT findings including pulmonary fibrosis BA.1 + -/perimy o-/myocarditis (3 -26%), changes in microstructural and brain integrit y with persistent neurological s ymptoms (55%), increased incidence of p sychiatric diagnoses (5.8% versus 2.5 -3.4% in controls), and incomplete recovery of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction (33 -36%).167 Yang et al conducted a meta -analy sis of 72 studies with a total of 88,769 patients to examine the occurre nce of different sy mptoms up to one year of follow -up for previously hospitalized patients with COVID -19. A total of 167 sequelae related to COVID -19 were identified, the more common ones being fatigue of most s ymptoms declined after > 9 months of follow -up, but fatigue and somnipathy persisted in 26.2% and 15.1% of patients, respectivel y.168 The incide nce of Long Covid is progressively greater among non -hospitalized to hospitalized to those hospitalized and treated in the ICU. It varies from 16 and 53% of patients and occurs more frequently in patients after infection with the Alpha or Delta variants i n comparison with patients infected with the Omicron variant.136Major organ damage post - discharge among adults hospitalized for COVID -19, including incident cardiac, pulmonary , liver, acute and chronic kidney , stroke, diabetes, and coagulation disorders were consistently greater in adults hospitalised for COVID -19 com pared with non -COVID -controls in a meta - analysis of nine studies with follow -up of patients ranging from 4 to 22 weeks post - discharge.169 Cardiovascular sequelae in post -acute COVID -19 heart disease, hear t failure, 135134 Pulmonary symptoms and complicati ons seen in long Covid include dyspnoea (occurring in 15% of non -hospitalized patients and up to 81% of previousl y hospitalized patients), cough, chest pain, or decreased exercise tolerance.170 A systematic review and meta -analysis assessed the long -term neurocognitive effects of COVID -19 in three studies comprised of 3,304 post -COVID -19 patients. Persistent neurological / cognitive sequelae of Covid -19 infection included headache chiatric s 31%, feeling depressed 20%, and suicidality 2%.171 Dangay ach et al reports in a narrative review of the literature that neurologic complications in post -acute COVID -19 range from persistent fatigue, headaches, anxiety , and postural in patients with mild disease.148 Musculoskeletal disorders with long COVID, including persisting or new -onset fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, arthritis, and muscle weakness, were noted in review of sy stematic reviews and meta -analyses BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 57Complicatio ns of Long -Covid in paediatric populations It has been estimated that up to 25% of the >14,000,000 children with COVID -19 in the y ear 2019 have developed persistent sy mptoms of fatigue, post -exertional malaise, neurologic and cognitive s ymptoms, and other symptoms that interfere with activities of daily living for months after their initial illness; however more recent data suggest that the proportion of paediatric COVID -19 patients with long -term sequelae/s ymptoms is in the range of 3 -10%.172 Post-acute COVID s ymptoms in children with asymptomatic or mild disease appear to be less severe than in adults, with the most common symptoms being a post -viral cough (4%), fatigue (2%), or both s ymptoms (1%) with the duration of s ymptoms lasting 3 to 8 w eeks.173 17489 Pellegrino et al performed a sy stematic literature review up to 15 February 2022 to summarize long COVID evidence and to assess prevalence and clinical presentation in children and adolescents. Twenty -two articles were included; 9 studies provided a control group. The authors found high variabil ity in terms of prevalence (1.6 -70%). The most frequentl y reported s ymptoms were fatigue (2 -87%), headache (3.5 -80%), arthro -myalgias (5.4-66%), chest tightness or pain (1.4 -51%), and dy spnoea (2 -57.1%). Five studies reported limitations in daily function due to long COVID; most studies did not detect evidence of long -term pulmonary sequelae in these patients.175 Important co -morbidities: As mentioned previously, there are a number of common comorbidities in patients with COVID -19; many of these conditions are also associated with more severe disease or progression of disease. Important comorbidities in those with more severe disease/ hospitali sed COVID -19 patients include hy pertension, diabetes, obesity , cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease or asthma, chronic kidney disease, cancer, chronic liver disease and autoimmune disease .29-31,113,117 176120607770697374441187614757172 Prevalen ce of these conditions have been reported to be lower in mild cases and higher among fatal cases, as shown for European countries inTable 11using TESSy data posted on BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk June Page 58Table 11.Preconditions among COVID -19 Patients in EU/EEA, by Severity of Disease.

Among those hospitalised for COVID - 19, a large num ber of comorbidities had elevated prevalence compared to the full cohort and those who tested positive: obesity , hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 59Table 12.Comorbidities in Individuals tested for COVID -19 in the Providence St.Joseph Health System -States of California, Oregon, and Washington, 40.2 Diabetes 9.4 10.9 28.3 Weight Underw eight 2.1 1.7 3.1 Normal 29.0 23.9 24.3 Overw eight 31.7 32.6 30.3 Class 1 Obesity 19.8 22.3 21.2 Class 2 Obesity 9.6 11.1 10.9 Class 3 Obesity 7.7 8.6 10.3 Asthma 6.5 5.3 6.7 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 4.0 2.6 8.3 Coronary Artery Disease 5.5 3.6 9.7 Myocardial Infarction 2.2 1.6 5.5 Congestive Heart Failure 5.3 3.9 13.2 Kidney Disease 5.6 5.3 17.2 Liver Disease 3.1 2.5 4.0 Cancer 6.1 3.0 6.3 In a retrospective cohort of 135,794 individuals under the age of 25 who were tested for COVID -19 by 08 September 2020 within the PEDSnet network of US paediatric health systems, the proportion of obese individuals was similar among those who tested negative (18%) and among mild or as ymptomatic COVID -19 cases (19%), but clearly elevated among severe COVID -19 cases (37%).41Those with severe cases of COVID -19 more commonly had chronic conditions in at least two body systems, with 25% of COVID -19 negative individuals, 17% mi ld or asymptomatic cases, and 38% of severe cases having multiple chronic conditions. More recent data provide insight into comorbidities among the paediatric population. For the period January 01-March 31 ,2021 across 14 states, the CDC's COVID - NET dat abase recorded 204 adolescents aged 12 -17 who were hospitalized for likely primarily COVID -related reasons.38 Among the 204 adole scents, 70.6% had at least one major underl ying medical condition, the most common conditions being obesity (35.8%), chronic lung diseases including asthma (30.9%), and neurologic disorders (14.2%) .38 A recent sy stematic review and meta -analysis using published reports through August 25, 2021 revealed that prematurity in young infants (RR, 2.26; disease (RR, CI 1.71 signi ficant comorbidities associated with severe COVID -19 (intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and/or death) in children.178BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 60Crossfield et al performed a population -based prospective study linking individual genetic, biomarker, survey and electronic health record data from >500 000 UK participant s, aged 40-69 years at recruitment (2006 -2010). The study used individual patient -level data from the UK BioBank database, linked to COVID -19 data sets from laboratories, hospitals, and death certificates. The study population included those who provided baseline assessment data, were alive at the start of the study period and had not withdrawn consent. All subjects had a COVID -19 diagnosis by a positive laboratory test result ,or an ICD -10 code U071 or U072 recorded in hospital or death certificate data. A cohort of 9560 patients with COVI D- 19 of whom 50.8% (n=4,860) were women and 7,274 (76.1%) were White European were included. The most common comorbidities of the study population included cardiovascular disease (12.8%), chronic respiratory disease (1 5.5%), chronic kidney disease (0.8), diabetes (7.1%), h ypertension (28.6%), chronic liver disease (0.3%), and neurological disease (2.3%). The total number of comorbidities per subject was 0: 52.7%; 1: 31.7% and 2: 15.6%. 60 Alharbi et al conducted a retrospective, cross -sectional observational of patients in a COVID - 19-designated specialty hospital in Saudi Arabia. Over an 11 -month period from March 2020 to January 2021, corresponding to the first wave of infection in the country when therapeutic interventions had limited options and were mostly dependent o n a given patient's condition. A total of 619 patients' records (non -ICU = 369 and I CU = 250 patients, 61.4% male, 6.3% age 0 -20 years, 16.8% age 21 -40, 27.9% age 41 -60, and 48.9% age >60) with confirmed COVID -19 diagnosed with a real -time PCR assay for SARS -CoV -2 were included. The most common comorbidities of the study population included hy pertension (59.8%), diabetes (47.2%), chronic pulmonary disease (28.6%), heart failure (13.2%), coronary artery disease (4.8%), and cancer (2.7%).118 A prospective observational study of hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection by reverse transcription -polymerase chain reaction and treated with advanced respiratory support (i ncluding high -flow nasal cannula, non -invasive mechanical ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation )during the first two y ears of the pandemic was conducted by Reyes et al. Included were a total of 66,565 patients from five continents (63.5% male, 82.6% hospitalized and treated in high -income countries, 78.2% hospitalized and treated in Europe, 44.0% between 60 and 80 y ears old) were included. The most common comorbidities of the study population included arterial h ypertension (41.3), diabetes mell itus (30.3%), chronic cardiac disease (not h ypertension; 22.1%), asthma (12.2%), chronic kidney disease 11.3%), obesity asthma; 13.3%), (8.1%), (7.4%), and dementia 6.0%).179 Ozonoff et al conducted a prospective, observational study of hospitalized patients with COVID -19from 20 hospitals (affiliated with 15 academic institutions) across the US. Symptomatic patients 18 with confirmed positive SARS -CoV -2 PCR were enrolled within 48 hour of hospital admission. Hospital admission data collected up to 11 November 2021 was anal yzed. Between 05 May 2020 and 19 March 2021, 1,164 patients enrolled in the study and who met eligibility criteria were included in the final anal ysis. The median age of the study population was 59 y ears (interquartile range 20), 61% were me n, and 32% smoked or used + Management Plan June 61The common comorbid conditions included hy pertension 58%, diabetes 37%, chronic lung disease (not asthma) 20%, asthma 15%, chronic cardiac disease 27%, chronic kidney disease 15%, chronic liver d isease 5%, chronic neurologic disorder 12%, organ transplantation 5%, malignancy 10%, drug, or alcohol abuse 8%, class 1 -2 obesity (BMI=30 - 39.9) 41%, class 3 obesity (BMI=40+) 14%.14 Lastl y, an observational study of all COVID -19 patients admitted to 19 Dutch I CUs participating in both the national quality registry National Intensive Care Evaluation and the EHR -based Dutch Data Warehouse as conducted by Vagliano et al. A total of 1,533 patients from the EHR and 1,563 from the registry were included. Subjects were 18 y ears old and were admitted between 15 February 2020 and 01 January 2021 with confirmed COVID -19 by positive real -time reverse transcriptase pol ymerase chain reaction assay for SARS -CoV -2 or, in the earl y phase of the pandemic, with a CT -scan consistent with COVID -19. The authors developed multiple models on data from the first 24 hours of ICU admissions from February to Jun e2020 (first wave) and val idated the models on prospective patients admitted to the same I CUs between Jul yand Dec ember 2020 (second wave). The authors reported the prevalence of the following comorbidities during the first and second waves, respectivel y, as follows: acute renal fa ilure (9.5% and 9.3%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease failure (9.5% 9.1%), chronic respiratory insufficiency (3.2% and 2.0%), diabetes (21.5% and 26.9%) .133 With respect to comorbidities among persons infected with the Omicron variant, little published data was found. A study using data from 17 of 18 regional health agencies in France examined the demographic characteristics of 468 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant from 23 November 2021 to 11 January 2022. The cases were of a median age of 35 years, and 55% were female . Among the 278 cases in whom the information was known, 39 (14%) had been previously infected with Covid -19. Among the 394 cases with data on vaccination status, 92 (23%) were unvaccinated, 254 cases (64%) had received 2 doses of vaccine and 28 case s (7%) had received 3 doses.18Only 16% had pre -existing conditions (hypertension, obesit y, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, renal insufficiency, cancer, immunosuppression, liver disease, heart disease, neuromuscular condition, other cond ition, or pregnancy ). The prevalence of the individual comorbidities was not reported by the authors .18It is possible that the low rate of comorbidities in this study population is driven by the relativel y low age of the patients studied. In the US (Virginia), data were collected from electronic medical records of adults ( 18 years) with a diagnosis of COVID -19 (ICD -10 code U07.1) hospitalized in a single health care s ystem from 05 March 2020 to 05 February 2022 to evaluate hospitalized patients with COVID -19.20The healthcare s ystem includes five hospitals in Virginia with a total of 1,800 licensed acute care beds. The study period was constructed based on the most prevalent SARS -CoV -2 variant at the time as follows: March 2020 -June 2021 (pre -Delta), July 2021 2022 (predominantl y-Omicron). The prevalence of most common comorbidities of the study population, stratified by the variant that was predominant at the time of patient admission are shown in Table 13.20 BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 Plan June 2023 Page 62Table 13.Prevalence (%) of most common comorbid conditions among patient hospitalized for COVID -19 in a single health care system from March 5th, 2020, to February 5th, 2022, by predominant variant at the time of admission Pre-Delta Delta Omicron 8.9 8.6 Myocardial infarction 8.5 13.4 14.5) Congestive heart failure 14.9 20.9 25.1 Peripheral vascular disease 10.5 13.0 16.3 Cerebrovascular disease 12.6 16.2 17.9 Dem entia 12.4 12.3 16.1 Chronic pulmonary disease21.3 24.9 29.4 Mild liver disease 9.5 11.2 11.1 Diabetes without complications 21.7 16.2 13.9 Diabetes with complications 15.5 20.0 23.2 Renal disease 19.7 24.5 31.5 Non-metastatic cancer 5.0 7.0 8.4 Chen X, et al performed an observational cohort study of hospitalized patients confirmed with SARS -CoV -2 during the 2022 Omicron wave in Shanghai, China. Eligible patients were required to be 18 y ears old with confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection by real-time PCR between Mar 20 and May 10, 2022. Data on all enrolled participants were ob tained from the hospital information sy stem at which they were admitted. A total of 847 eligible patients were included in the study (age 70 years 30.3%, not fully vaccinated 55.8%, 0 comorbidities long-term bedridden 19.0%). The most common reported comorbidities were heart conditions 30.3%, metabolic disease 18.5%, chronic kidney disease stage 4 -5 (glomerular filtration rate 30 ml/min) or BA.1 + BNT162b2 June 2023 Page 63Module SII. Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification Nonclinical evaluation BNT162b2 (COVID -19 mRNA vaccine) included pharmacology immunogenicit y NHP immunogenicity and challenge studies), pharmacokinetic (series of biodistribution, metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies), and toxicity (2 GLP rat repeat -dose toxicity ) studies in vitro and in vivo. A GLPDART study was also completed. No additional toxicity studies are planned for COVID -19mRNA vaccine .Mouse immunogenicit y studies were also conducted with variant modified vaccines. Nonclinical studies in mice and NHP for COVID -19 mRNA vaccine demonstrated both a strong neutralizing antibody response and a Th1 -type CD4+and an IFN +CD8+T-cell response. The Th1 profile is characteri sed by a strong IFN, but not IL -4, response indicating the absence of a potentially deleterious Th2 immune response and is a pattern favored for vaccine safety and efficacy .180 Rhesus macaques (Stud y VR -VRT -10671) 100 \u00b5g COVID -19 mRNA vaccine or saline 21 days apart were challenged with 1.05 \u00d7 106plaque forming units of SARS -CoV -2 (strain USA -WA1/2020), split equally between the intranasal and intratracheal routes.181 COVI D- 19 mRNA vaccine provided complete protection from the presence of detectable vi ral RNA in the lungs compared to the saline control with no clinical, radiological or histopathological evidence of vaccine -elicited disease enhancement. Variant monovalent formulations or also as bivalent formulations (Original + Variant) elicited robust neutralizing antibod y responses in mice. Responses were generall y highest against the variant matched to the vaccine; bivalent formulations provid ed a greater breadth of the antibody response in na\u00efve mice compared to monovalent formulations. When administered as a 3rd dose booster to mice that received 2 prior doses of BNT162b2, Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant vaccines elicited a more balanced response against Omicron sublineages compared to a booster with an Omicron BA.1 variant vaccine. An intravenous rat PK study , using an LNP with the identical lipid composition as COVI D- 19 mRNA vaccine, demonstrated that the novel lipid excipients in the LNP formul ation, ALC-0315 and ALC0159, distribute from the plasma to the liver. -While there was no detectable excretion of either lipid in the urine, the percent of dose excreted unchanged in faeces was ~1% for AL C-0315 and ~50% for ALC0159. Further studies indicated -metabolism play ed a role in the elimination of AL C0315. -Biodistribution was assessed using luciferase expression as a surrogate reporter formulated like COVID -19 mRNA vaccine, with the identical lipid composition. After IM injection of the LNPformulated RNA encoding luciferase in BALB/c mice, luciferase protein expression was demonstrated at the site of injection 6 hours post dose and expression decreased over time to almost reach background levels after 9 day s-. Luciferase was detected to a lesser extent in the liver; expression was present at 6 hours after injection and was not detected by 48hours after injection. After IM administration of a radiolabelled LNP -mRNA formulation containing ALC -0315 and AL C-0159 to rats, the percent of admini stered dose was also greatest at the injection site. Outside of the injection site, total recovery of radioactivity was greatest in the liver and much lower in the spleen, with very little recovery in the adrenal glands and ovaries. The metabolism of AL C-0315 and AL C-0159 was evaluated in blood, liver microsomes, S9 fractions, and hepatocy tes from mice, rats, monkey s, and humans. BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 64The in vivo metabolism was examined in rat plasma, urine, faeces , and liver samples from the PK study . ALC -0315 and AL C-0159 are metaboli sed by hydroly tic metabolism of the ester and amide functionalities, respectivel y, and this hy drolytic metabolism is observed across the species evaluated. In GL P toxicity studies, two variants of the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine candidate were tested, \"variant 8\" 9\" (V8 and V9, in their codon optimi sation sequences which are designed to improve antigen expression, otherwise the amino acid sequences of the encoded antigens are identical. COVID -19 mRNA vaccine (V9) was evaluated clinically and submitted for application. Two GLP-compliant repeat -dose toxicity studies were performed in Wistar Han rats; one with each variant. Both studies were 17 day s in duration with a 3 -week recovery period. A DART study in Wistar Han rats has been completed. Safet y pharmacology, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted, in accordance with the 2005 WHO vaccine guideline.182 The IM route of exposure was selected for nonclinical investigation as it is the clinical route of administration. Rats were selected as the toxicology test species as they demonstrated an antigen -specific immune response to the vaccin e and are routinel y used for regulatory toxicity studies with an extensive historical safety database. Administration of up to 100 \u00b5g COVID -19 mRNA vaccine b y IM injection to male and female Wistar Han rats once every week, for a total of 3 doses, was tole rated without evidence of s ystemic toxicity . Expected inflammatory responses to the vaccine were evident such as oedema and ery thema at the injection sites, transient elevation in body temperature, elevations in WBC count and acute phase reactants, and lo wer A:G ratios. Injection site reactions were common in all vaccine -administered animals and were greater after boost immuni sations. Changes secondary to inflammation included slight and transient reduction in body weights and transient reduction in reti culocy tes, platelets, and RBC mass parameters. Decreased reticulocy tes were reported in rats treated with the licensed LNP -siRNA pharmaceutical Onpattro (NDA # 210922) but have not been observed in humans treated with this biotherapeutic183suggesting this is a species -specific effect. Decreased platelet counts were noted after re peat administration, but were small in magnitude of change, likel y related to inflammation -related platelet activation and consumption, and unassociated with other alterations in h aemostasis. Elevated levels of gamma -glutam yl transferase were observed in the first repeat -dose toxicity study with COVID -19 mRNA vaccine (V8) without evidence of cholestasis or hepatobiliary injury but was not recapitulated in the second repeat dose-toxicity study with COVID -19 mRNA vaccine (V9), the final clinical candidate. All changes in clinical pathology parameters and acute phase proteins were reversed at the end of the recovery phase for COVID -19 mRNA vaccine, with the exception of low magnitude higher red cell distribution wi dth (consistent with a regenerative ery throid response) and lower A:G ratios (resulting from acute phase response) in animals administered COVID -19 mRNA vaccine. Macroscopic pathology and organ weight changes were also consistent with immune activation an d inflammatory response and included increased size and /orweight of draining iliac l ymph nodes and spleen. Vaccine -related microscopic findings at the end of the dosing phase consisted of oedema and inflammation in injection sites and surrounding tissues , increased cellularity in the draining iliac l ymph nodes, bone marrow and spleen and BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 65hepatocy te vacuolation in the liver. Vacuolation of portal hepatocy tes, the only test article - related liver microscopic finding, was not associated with an y microscopic e vidence of hepatic injury or hepatic functional effects (i.e., liver functional enzy mes were not elevated) and may be associated with hepatocy te uptake of the LNP lipids.184 Microscopic findings at the end of the dosing phase were partiall y or completely recovered in all animals at the end of the 3 -week recovery period for COVID -19 mRNA vaccine. A robust immune response was elicited to the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine antigen. Administration of COVID -19 mRNA vaccine to female rats twice before the start of mating and twice during gestation at the human clinical dose (30 \u00b5g) was associated with non - adverse effects (bod y weight, food consumption and effects localized to the injection site) after each dose administration. However, there were no effects of COVID -19 mRNA vaccine administration on mating performance, fertility , orany ovarian or uterine parameters in the F0 female rats nor on embry o-fetal or postnatal survival, growth, or development in the F1offspring. An immune response was confirmed in F0 female rats following administration of each vaccine candidate and these responses were also detectable in the F1 offspring (f oetuses and pups). In summary , the nonclinical safety findings related to COVI D-19 mRNA vaccine administration primarily represent an expected immune reaction to vaccine administration and are clinicall y manageable or acceptable risks in the intended population. The key safet y findings regarding COVID -19 mRNA vaccine from nonclinical studies and their relevance to human usage are presented in Table 14. There was no evidence of vaccine -elicited disease enhancement.BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 Management Plan June 2023 Page 66Table 14.Key Safety Findings and Relevance to Human Usage Key Safety findings from Nonclinical StudiesaRelevance to Hum an Usage Pharm acology NHP Challenge Model No evidence of vaccine -elicited disease enhancement .Suggests low risk of vaccine -enhanced disease in humans; being investigated in CTs. Toxicity Injection site reactions: Injection site reactions were common and reversible or showed signs of reversibility at the end of the 3 -week recovery period in nonclinical studies. In common with other vaccines, COVID -19 mRNA vaccine administration has the potential to generate injection site reactions such as oedem a and erythema at the injection sites. Inflammation and immune activation: Evidence of inflammation or immune activation was common, reversible, and included transiently higher body temperature, higher circulating WBCs, and higher acute phase reactants. Secondarily, transiently lower body weights, reticulocytes, platelets, and RBC mass parameters were observed.In common with all vaccines, COVID -19 m RNA vaccin e administration has the potential to generate inflammation which can lead to increased body temperature, higher circulating WBCs and higher acute phase proteins. Decreased reticulocytes have not been observed in humans treated with the LNPsiRNA pharmaceu tical Onpattro183, suggesting this finding in rats is a species -specific effect . COVID -19 m RNA vaccine administration has the potential to transiently decrease platelets and RBC mass parameters. These transient decreases are anticipated to be slight and are not likely to be clinically meaningful. Developm ental and Reproductive Toxicity No vaccine -related effects on female fertility or the development of fetuses or offspring were observed in a DART study of COVID -19 mRNA vaccine in rats.No effects are anticipated in WOCBP, pregnant women or their offspring. a.Safety pharmacology, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity studies were not conducted, in accordance with 2005 WHO vaccine guideline, as they are generally not considered necessary to support development and lic ensure of vaccines for infectious diseases . In addition, the components of the vaccine construct are lipids and RNA and are not expected to have carcinogenic or genotoxic potential. BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 Management Plan June 2023 Page 67Module SIII. Clinical Trial Exposure Four vaccine candidates were evaluated in Stud y BNT162 -01. Based on safety and immunogenicit y results from this study , 2 vaccine candidates, BNT162b1 and BNT162b2, were selected fo r evaluation in Study C4591001, which is a Phase 1/2/3 randomi sed, placebo -controlled, observer -blind, dose -finding, vaccine candidate -selection, and efficacy study in health y adults . Phase 1 of Study C4591001 comprised dose -level -finding evaluations of th e 2 selected vaccine candidates; multiple dose levels (some corresponding to those evaluated in Study BNT162 -01) were evaluated. Stud y vaccine was administered using the same 2 -dose schedule as in Study BNT162 -01 (21 day s apart). Dose levels were administ ered first to an 18-to 55 -year age cohort, then to a 56-to 85 -year age cohort. Both vaccine candidate constructs were safe and well tolerated. BNT162b2 at the 30-\u00b5g dose level was selected and advanced to the Phase 2/3 expanded cohort and efficacy evaluation primaril y because: the reactogenicit y profile for BNT162b2 was more favourable than BNT162b1 in both younger and older adults with similar immunogenicity results . in ), a trend toward earlier clearance of BNT162b2 was observed in the nose. Phase 2 of the stud yC4591001 (forwhich enrolment has completed) comprised the evaluation of safet y and immunogenicit ydata for the first 360 participants (180 from the active vaccine group and 180 from the placebo group, with each group divided between the younger and older age cohorts) entering the stud y after completion of Phase 1. The Phase 3 part of the study C4591001 (which is ongoing) evaluates the efficacy and safety in all participants (including the first 360 participants from Phase 2). Phase 3 introduced enrolment of participants 16 to 17 y ears of age to be evaluated with the 18 -to 55 -year-old cohort, a s well as enrolment of a 12 -to 15-year-old cohort, and immunogenicity data from participants 12-to15-year-oldcohort are anticipated to bridge to the 16 -to 25 -year-old cohort. Booster groups were subsequently added to evaluate boostability and protecti on against variant virus strains. The pivotal study was initially planned to enrol approximately 30,000 participants, which would have a probability of 78% of detecting an AE with a frequency of 0.01% (1/1000 0) and a probabilit y of 95% of detecting an AE w ith a frequency of 0.02% (1/500 0). The protocol was amended to enrol approximately 46,000participants, which slightly enhance dthe ability to detect AEs. However, rarer events might not be detected.BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 68Participants in the pivotal study were initially planned to be followed for up to 24 months in order to assess the potential for late -occurring adverse reactions, such as the theoretical risk of VAED including VAERD. After completing the final efficacy anal ysis with vaccine efficacy shown to be 95%, and obtaining regulatory authorisation to vaccinate in many countries, MAHstarted to unblind all participants to determine those participants randomised to placebo so that they could be offered vaccine in accordance with local authorisation. In study C45 91001, the total follow -up time from Dose 1 to unblinding for the 21,926 participants in the vaccine group was 83.4 person -yearand for the 21,921 participants in the placebo group was 82.2 person -years. The efficacy anal ysis in the 12 y ears and older populat ion for the primary series, the anal ysis of 6-month post dose 2 data in the 16 y ears and older population and the evaluation of booster effects and/or protection against emerging SARS -CoV -2 variants of concern, in participants 18 to 55 y ears of age have be en reported out in previous RMPs. Refer to Annex 7 for CT exposure. Analy sis of 6 -month post Dose -3 data was conducted on 12 to 15 y ears of age who received the BNT162b2 booster at the cut -off on 03 November 2022. Clinical trial exposure tables are provide d in Annex 7 (Table 28 to Table 3 0). Further evaluation for the paediatric population (5 -<12 years of age) has been conducted in study C4591007 (see Annex 7 from Table 31 to Table 38). Phase 1 is the dose finding portion of the stud y. Dose levels were tested in sentinel cohorts of children b y age de -escalation, starting with the lowest dose level in the oldest age group. For each age group, the dose level identified as safe and tolerable and immunogenic in C4591007. Phase 1 was advanced for further eva luation in Phase 2/3. Phase 2/3 (which is ongoing) was planned to evaluate BNT162b2 at the selected dose levels for each age group for safety and tolerability , immunogenicity , and efficacy (depending on meeting success criteria for immunobridging and accru al of a sufficient number of COVID - 19 cases). An immunobridging analy sis was designed to compare SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody responses in paediatric participants within each age group in Study C4591007 to a group of young adult participants 16 to 25 y ears of age in the C4591001 efficacy study . The study design was modified (Amendment 6) to provide the necessary safety and immunogenicit y data to support an EUA and future licensure of a booster (third) dose of BNT162b2 to maximize the protection agains t variants of concern including Delta and Omicron as seen in real -world vaccine effectiveness in older age groups. Exposure to the booster (3rd) dose of BNT162b2 for participants aged 5 to <12 y ears of age by demographic characteristics is shown in Annex 7(Table 39 and Table 40). In addition, exposure in special population for participants 5 to <12 y ears of age who received a booster (3rd) dose is shown in Annex 7 (Table 41). Further evaluation for the paediatric population (from the 2 to <5 y ears and 6 months to <2 years of age) has been conducted in study C4591007 (which remains ongoing).

Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the Development Programme Detailed descriptions of all inclusion and exclusion criteria for clinical studies are provided in the individual CSRs . Inclusion criteria Health y participants who are determined b y medical history, ph ysical examination (ifrequired), and clinical judgment of the investigator to be eligible for inclusion in the study . Health y participants with pre -existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitali sation for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment , can be included. Forthe overall Phase 3 study populatio n to be as representative and diverse as possible, the inclusion of participants with known chronic stable infection with HIV, HCV, or HBV was permitted as the study progressed. Specific criteria for these Phase 3 participants can be found in the Section 10.8 of C4591001 protocol . Study C4591001 Phase 2/3 only : Participants who, in the judgment of the investigator, are at higher risk for acquiring COVID -19 (including, but not limited to, use of mass transportation, relevant demographics, front -line essenti al workers and others). The participants enrolled in Study C4591001 were 12 years of age and older; with the 12 - to 15 -year-old cohort included in the protocol starting from October 2020. The participants enrolled in Study C4591007 were 5 to <12 y ears, 2 to <5 years, and 6 months to <2 y ears of age. The p articipants enrolled in C4591031 Substudy E and Substudy D were 18 years of age and older. The participants enrolled in C4591048 Substudy D were 5 to <12 yearsand in Substudy B were 2 to <5 years, and 6 m onths to <2 y ears of age. Exclusion criteria Phase 1 exclusion criteria were stricter than criteria in Phases 2 and 3 of the study . Participants were excluded from the studies according to the general criteria listed below: Previous vaccination with any coronavirus vaccine Reason for exclusion : To avoid confounding the assessment of serological or clinical immune response in the study population. Is it considered to be included as missing information ? No.BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 98Rationale: Minimal potential clinical impact on th e target population. Previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID -19 Reason for exclusion : Phase 1 excluded participants with a previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID -19 because these participants may have some degree of protect ion from subsequent infection by SARS -CoV -2 and therefore would confound the pivotal efficacy endpoint. During Phase 2/3, participants with prior undiagnosed infection were allowed to be enrolled. Screening for SAR S-CoV -2 with nucleic acid amplification test by nasal swab or antibodies to non -vaccine SARS -CoV -2 antigen by serology was not conducted before vaccine administration in Phase 2/3, but samples were taken to run these assay s after vaccination, thus identifying participants with unidentified prio r infection. This group will be assessed to identify whether prior infection affects safet y. Is it considered to be included as missing information ? No. Rationale : Safet y in study participants with prior infection wasassessed in the pivotal study . Immuno compromised individuals with known or suspected immunodeficiency, as determined by history and/or laboratory/physical examination Reason for exclusion : Immunocompromised participants may have impaired immune responses to vaccines and would therefore limit the ability to demonstrate efficacy , which is the primary pivotal endpoint. Is it considered to be included as missing information? Yes. Rationale : Participants with potential immunodeficient status were not specifically included in the study population. However, since the study population is intended to be as representative as possible of the vulnerable population to COVI D-19 illness, sub-analyses of immunogenicity data in future studies may provide further understanding of immune responses in this population. Receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulin, from 60 days before study intervention administration or planned receipt throughout the study Reason for exclusion : To avoid confounding the assessment of serological or clinical immune respo nse in the study population. Is it considered to be included as missing information ? No. Rationale : No impact on the safet y of the target population. Women who are pregnant or breastfeedingBNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 99Reason for exclusion : To avoid use in a vulnerable population. Is it considered to be included as missing information ? Yes. Rationale : Maternal vaccination with COVI D 19 mRNA vaccine has been studied in C4591015 to explore unexpected negative consequences to the embry o or foetus. Other medical or psychiatric condition in cluding recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation/ behaviour or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant inappropriate for the study Reason for exclusio n: To avoid misleading results deriving from non -compliance to study procedures. Is it considered to be included as missing information ? No. Rationale : Safet y profile of COVID -19 mRNA vaccine is not expected to differ in these subjects when properl y administered. SIV.2. Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development Programmes The clinical studies are limited in size and, therefore, unlikely to detect very rare adverse reactions, or adverse reactions with a long latency .

Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically Under -Represented in Clinical Trial Development Programmes There has been limited exposure to COVI D-19 mRNA vaccine in some special populations and no epidemiologic studies have been conducted in pregnant/ breastfeeding wom en, paediatric participants (<1 2years of age), and specific subpopulations that were excluded from the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine program . Table 44.Exposure of Special Populations included or not in Clinical Trial Development Programmes Type of special popu lationExposure Pregnant womenThere is limited experience with use of COVID -19 mRNA vaccine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition, or post -natal development. Administratio n of COVID -19 m RNA vaccine in pregnancy should only be considered w hen the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus.

Breastfeeding w omenBreastfeeding w omen were not initially included in the COVID -19 m RNA vaccine clinical development program. Itis unknown whether COVID -19 mRNA vaccine is excreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for COVID -19 m RNA vaccine and any potential adverse effects on the breas tfed newborn /infant/toddler from COVID - 19 mRNA vaccine or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition ,complicated by underlying risks, is susceptible to disease prevented by the vaccine.

Additional EU Requirements for the Safety Specification Potential for misuse for illegal purposes COVID -19 mRNA vaccine does not have characteristics that would make it attractive for use for illegal purposes; therefore, there is onl y a low potential for COVID -19 mRNA vaccine misuse for illegal purposes. Module SVII. Identified and Potential Risks In accordance with EMA RMP guidance for COVID -19 vaccines, the below factors were taken into consideration for the generation of the safet y specification and are not determined to be identified or potential risks . The vaccine construct and the formulation . The COVID -19mRNA vaccine consists of non -infectious, non -replicating RNA in a lipid -based formulation, which delivers the RNA to cells in the immuni sed person. Protein expression from the RNA is transient, and as is RNA itself. There is no systemic toxicity associa ted with the LNP or its metabolism (Study reports 38166 and 20GR142). Vacuolation of hepatocy tes was observed in rat toxicity studies and believed to be associated with the uptake of the LNP and was without evidence of an y effect on liver function. The li ver vacuolation was reversed approximately 3-weeks after the last administration . The degradation of the active substance / antigen and potential impact on safety related to this; (e.g. ,for mRNA -based vaccines). Like endogenous mRNA in the cytosol, vacc ine RNA in cy tosol is degraded. The COVID -19 mRNA contains no known toxic products of the degradation of the RNA or the lipids in the formulation. The vaccine does not contain an adjuvant . SVII.1. Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission The safet y concerns of COVID -19 mRNA vaccine in the initial RMP are listed 57.BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 116Table 57.Summary of Safety Concerns Important Identified Risks Anaphylaxis Important Potential Risks Vaccine -associated enhanced disease (VAED) including Vaccine -associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) Missing Information Use in pregnancy and while breast feeding Use in immunocompromised patients Use in frail patients with co -morbidities (e.g. ,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders Interaction with other vaccines Long term safety data SVII.1.1. Risks not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in the RMP Not all potential or identified risks for the vaccine are considered to meet the level of importance nece ssitating inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP. Reason sfor not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in thisRMP include : Risks with minimal and temporary clinical impact on patients (in relation to the sev erity of the disease prevented ). The following reactogen icity events are identified risks not considered as Important: Injection site pain, Injection site swelling and Injection site redness, Pyrexia , Chills, Fatigue, Headache, Myalgia ,and Arthralgia . Very rare potential risks for an y medicinal treatment, including vaccines, which are well known to healthcare professionals are not included in the list of safety concerns . In acknowledgment of the EMA core RMP19 guidance, the reactogenicit y profile of COV ID-19 mRNA vaccine is discussed below with respect to observed differences in solicited reactogenicity systemic events between Dose 1 ,Dose 2,and Dose 3 . The observed differences do not impact the safet y profile of the vaccine and are not proposed to be included in the list of safety concerns, rather they are discussed for completeness in the presentation of the safet y profile.BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 117Reactogenicity C4591048 Substudy B Group 2 Subset ( 6 Months to <5 Years of With BNT162b2 Bivalent /OMI BA.4/BA.5) at 3 \u00b5g In this initial subset of 60 participants, the frequencies of local and systemic reactions reported within 7 day s after administration of BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at 3 \u00b5g were lower than the frequencies previously observ ed in association with BNT162b2 within the respective age group. C4591048 Substudy D Group 2 ( 5 to <12 Years Age): Booster (Fourth Dose) BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at 10 \u00b5g The days after BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) was generall y similar to that previously observed in association with BNT162b2 within the respective age group. C4591044 Cohorts 2 ( 12 Years of Age) and 3 ( 18 Years of Ag e): Booster (Fourth Dose) of BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at 30 or 60 \u00b5g The profile within 7 days after BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) vaccine was generall y similar to that previously observed in association with booster doses of an Omicron BA.1 -modified BNT162b2 bivalent vaccine and to BNT162b2 within the respective age groups at the same dose. Both local reactions and s ystemic events for participants who received the 30-\u00b5g dose level tended to be lower for adults >55 y ears of age compared with younger participants (18 through 55 y ears of age). There was an observed dose dependency for reactogenicit y between the BNT162b2 bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-and groups with most local reactions and sy stemic events reported more frequently after a 60 -\u00b5g dose, which is consistent with prior observations for BA.1 -modified bivalent and monovalent vaccines. C4591031 Substudy >55 years of age ) Local Reactio ns Pain at injection site was the most frequentl y reported local reaction within 7 days after stud y vaccination, with swelling and redness at the injection site reported much less frequentl y. Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity and all e vents resolved within a median duration of 1 to 2 day s after onset . Systemic Events Fatigue was the most frequently reported s ystemic event reported within 7 day s after study vaccination, followed b y headache, and less frequently chills, muscle and joint pain. Vomiting, diarrhoea and fever were the least frequently reported s ystemic events .Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severit yand all events resolved within a median duration of 1 to 2 day s after onset.BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 118C4591031 Substudy D (18 to 54 years of age) Local Reactions Any local reactions reported within 7 day s after first study (Dose 4) vaccination for Cohort 2 participants were similar in the BNT162b2 OMI 30 \u00b5g (78.6%) and BNT162b2 30 \u00b5g (79.4%) groups. Most events were mild or moderate in severit y, with the majority arising within the first 1 to 2 days after dosing and were short -lived .No Grade 4 local reactions were reported. Systemic Events Any systemic events reported within 7 day s after first stud y (Dose 4) vaccination for Cohort 2 participants were similar in the BNT162b2 OMI 30 \u00b5g (77.6%) and BNT162b2 30\u00b5g (72.9%) groups, and most events were mild or moderate in severit y, with the majority arising within the first 1 to 2 days after dosing and wer e short -lived. No Grade 4 sy stem events were reported. Participants 16 years of age and older The reactogenicit y data were collected b y participants' e -diary for reporting prompted local reactions and s ystemic events for 7 day s after each dose. Local Reactions Phase 1, Study BNT162 -01 Local reactions generall y increased in frequency and/or severit y with increasing dose level and number of doses of COVID -19 mRNA vaccine . Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity and resolved within several day s of onset. For COVID -19 mRNA vaccine , incidence of local reactions was generally less after each dose in the older group (56-85 years) compared with the y ounger group (18 -55 years), and severity of reactions was similar between both age groups . Phase 3, Study C4591001 In the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine group, pain at the injection site was reported more frequentl y in the younger group (16 -55 years) than in the older group (> 55 years), and frequency was similar after Dose 1 compared with Dose 2 of COVID-19 mRNA in the younger group (83.7% vs 78.3%) and in the older group (70.1% vs 66.1%). In the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine group, frequencies of redness and swelling were similar in the y ounger and older age group after Doses 1 and 2. Frequencies of redness w ere similar after Dose 1 compared with Dose 2 of COVID -19 mRNA vaccine in the y ounger age group (5.4% vs 5.6%) and in the older age group (5.3% vs 7.2%). Frequencies of swelling were similar after Dose 1 compared with Dose 2 of COVID -19 mRNA vaccine in the younger age group (6.3% vs 6.8%, respectivel y) and in the older age group (7.0% vs 7.8%). In the placebo BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 119group, redness and swelling were reported infrequently in the y ounger ( 1.0%) and older (1.2%) groups after Doses 1 and 2. Overall, across age groups, pain at the injection site did not increase after Dose 2, and redness and swelling were generally similar in frequency after Dose 1 and Dose 2. Severe redness and swelling were reported infrequently and were similar between the younger and older age groups ( 0.7) after an y dose. Severe pain at the injection site occurred more frequentl y in the younger age group compared to the older age group (2.5% vs 0.7%). After the first and second dose and in both age groups, the majority oflocal reactions were mild or moderate in severity , and no Grade 4 local reactions were reported. The median onset for local reactions after either dose was between Day 1.0 and Day 2.0 (Day 1.0 was the day of vaccination) in the younger age group and be tween Day 1.0 and Day 3.0 in the older age group. Local reactions resolved with median durations between 1.0 and 2.0 day s in both age groups. For local reactions the frequency of redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site after any dose of COVID -19mRNA vaccine was 8.5%, 10.2%, and 80.2% compared with 9.9%, 11.1%, and 84.5% for those SARS -CoV -2 positive and negative at baseline, respectivel y. While the frequency of local reactions was numerically higher in those negative at baseline, these differenc es are not clinically meaningful. Systemic Events Phase 1, Study BNT162 -01 Systemic events generally increased in frequency and/or severit y with increasing dose level and number of doses of COVID -19 mRNA vaccine . Most sy stemic events were mild or moderate, arose within the first 1 to 2 day s after dosing, and were short -lived. For COVID -19 mRNA vaccine , the incidence of s ystemic events after each dose was similar in the older group (56-85 years) compared with the younger group (18-55 years). Reports of severe systemic events were similar between the y ounger and older COVID -19 mRNA vaccine groups. Phase 3, Study C4591001 Systemic events were generall y increased in frequency and severit y in the younger group (16-55 years of age) compared with the older group (>55 years), with frequencies and severit y increasing with number of doses (Dose 1 vs Dose 2). Vomiting and diarrhoea were exceptions, which were reported similarly infrequently in both age groups and at similar incidences after each dose. Systemic events in the younger group compared with the older group, with frequencies increasing with number of doses (Dose 1 vs Dose 2), were: fatigue: y ounger group (49.4% vs 61.5%) compared (33.7% 51.0%) head ache: y ounger group (43.5% vs BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Management June 2023 Page 120myalgia: younger group (22.9% vs 39.3%) compared to older group vs 28.9%) chills: y ounger group (16.5% to group (6.5% vs 23.4%) arthralgia : younger group (11.8% vs 23.8%) compared to older group (8.7% vs 19.0%) pyrexia : younger group (4.1% vs 16.4%) to group (1.3% vs 11.8%) vomiting: y ounger group (1.2% vs group vs 0.7%) diarrhoea: y ounger group (10.7% vs 10.0%) compared to the older group (8.4% vs 8.2%). Systemic events were generall y reported less frequently in the placebo group than in the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine group, for both age groups and doses, with some exceptions. I n the y ounger age grou p, vomiting and diarrhoea (after Dose 1 and Dose 2) were reported at similar frequencies in the placebo group and the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine group. In the older age group, vomiting and diarrhoea (after Dose 1 and Dose 2) were reported at similar frequencies in the placebo group and the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine group. Following both Dose 1 and Dose 2, use of antipy retic/pain medication was slightly less frequent in the older age group (19.0% vs 37.0%) than in the younger age group (27.8% vs 45.2%) after both dos es, and medication use increased in both age groups after Dose 2 as compared with after Dose 1. Use of antipy retic/pain medication was less frequent in the placebo group than in the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine group and was similar after Dose 1 and Dose 2 in th e younger and older placebo groups (ranging from 9.3% to 13.7%). Severe pyrexia (>38.9\u00b0C to 40.0\u00b0C) increased in frequency with the number of doses (Dose 1 versus Dose 2) in younger (0.3% vs 1.5%) and older (0.0% vs 0.4%) participants who received COVID -19mRNA vaccine and was reported in 0.1% of participants who received placebo in both age group after both doses. One participant in the y ounger COVID -19 mRNA vaccine group reported pyrexia of 41.2\u00b0C only on Day 2 after Dose 2 and was nonfebrile for all othe r day s of the reporting period. Grade 4 pyrexia was not reported in the older COVID -19 mRNA vaccine group or in any placebo participants. After the first and second dose and in both age groups, the majority of systemic events were mild or moderate in seve rity. Systemic events in the younger and older age groups after either dose had a median onset day between Day 2.0 and Day 4.0 (Day 1.0 was the day of vaccination) and resolved with a median duration of 1 day in both age groups. For an y pyrexia (mild, moderate, severe or grade 4) after either dose there were 17.5% compared to 15.1% in those positive and negative for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, respectivel y. Severe pyrexia (>38.9\u00b0C to 40.0\u00b0C) was reported in 0.6% participant sand 1.0% participants in those p ositive and negative for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, respectivel y. The frequency for other sy stemic events after any dose was numerically lower for those positive at baseline: fatigue, headache and chills the frequency was 54.2%, 49.7% and 32.8% compared with 65%, 57.4%, 34.7% for those positive and negative for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 121respectivel y. Arthralgia was another exception where 27.1% compared to 25.0% were reported between those positive and negative for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline. Note that the baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive subgroup included far fewer participants the negative subgroup, so their results should be interpreted with caution . Participants 5 to <12 years of age Phase 1 and Phase 2/3 participants or their parent/legal guardian were to monitor and record reactogenicity for 7 day s after each dose; in the 5 to <12 y ears of age group, events included: Local reactions Pain, redness, swelling at the injection site . Overall, the pattern of local reactions reported in children 5 to <12 y ears of age after each dose was generall y similar to that observed in prior anal yses of Phase 2/3 participants 12 years of age in Study C4591001 with regard to pain at the injection si te, but children had slightly higher frequencies of swelling and redness at the injection site (still within tolerable limits). Systemic events Fever, fatigue, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhoea , new or worsened muscle pain, new or worsened joint pain . Overall, the pattern of s ystemic events reported in children 5 to <12 years of age after each dose was generall y comparable to, or less than, that observed in prior anal yses of Phase 2/3 participants 12 years of age in Study C4591001. Participants 2 to < 5 years of age Local reactions Pain/tenderness at the injection site was the most frequentl y reported local reaction within 7 days after each dose, with swelling and redness at the injection site reported much less frequentl y. Systemic events Fatigue was the most frequently reported s ystemic event reported within 7 day s after each dose, at similar frequencies in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups. Participants 6 Months to <2 Years of Age Local Reactions Tenderness at the injection site was the m ost frequently reported local reaction within 7 day s after each dose, with swelling and redness at the injection site reported much less frequently . BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 Plan June 2023 Page 122Systemic Events Irritability was the most frequentl y reported s ystemic event reported within 7 day s after each dose, followed b y drowsiness and decreased appetite. Overall, reactogenicity to three doses of vaccine was mostly mild to moderate and short - lived, with most events occurring at similar or lower frequencies after the third dose compared with the fir st or second dose of BNT162b2 3 -\u00b5g in infants and children 6 months to <5 y ears of age. The median onset of reactogenicity events was t ypically 1 to 2 days after each dose and most events resolved within 1 to 2 day s after onset. Adverse Events of Special I nterest (AESI) COVID -19 mRNA vaccine study C4591001 did not pre -specify AESI however, Pfizer utilizes a dy namic list of TME terms to be highlighted in clinical study safety data review. TMEs include events of interest due to their association with COVI D-19and terms of interest for vaccines in general and may include Preferred Terms, High Level Terms, High Level Group Terms or Standardised MedDRA Queries . For the purpose of the RMP and summary safet y reports, an AESI list was defined taking into considerati on the available lists of AESI s from the following expert groups and regulatory authorities: Brighton Collaboration (SPEAC)185 ACCESS protocol186 US CDC (preliminary list of AESI for VAERS surveillance)187 MHRA (unpublished guideline) . The AESI l ist is comprised of medical conditions to allow for changes and customisations of MedDRA terms as directed by AE reports and the evolving safet y profile of the vaccine. The terms searched in the safety database to identify cases of potential AESIs are pre sented by body system (eg. Cardiovascular, Hepatic, Respiratory , etc.) when possible, for ease of presentation. Medical concepts that are captured in the AESI list include: Immune and Autoimmune mediated events that are of interest for all vaccinations . Events associated with severe COVID -19. The AESIs are taken in consideration for all routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities.BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 123SVII.1.2. Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in the RMP Important Identified Risk: Myocarditis and Pericarditis Risk-benefit impact Myocarditis and pericarditis are serious conditions that may occur concomitantly and that may range in clinical importance from mild to life -threatening. Missing Information : Use in Pregnancy and while breas t feeding Risk-benefit impact The safet y profile of the vaccine is not fully known in pregnant or breastfeeding women due to their initial exclusion from the pivotal clinical study however ,post-marketing experience in pregnant women is available .188Additionally 2 clinical studies of the safety and immunogenicit y of the COVID -19 vaccine in pregnant women are ongoing ( to assess whether sub -cohorts of interest, such as pregnant women, experience i ncreased risk of safet y events of interest following receipt of the COVID -19 vaccine s(including modified vaccine s) are planned and another 2 non-interventional stud ies,C4591021 and C459102212are ongoing. It is important to obtain long term follow -up on women who were pregnant at or around the time of vaccination so that an y potential negative consequences to the pregnancy can be assessed and weighed against the effects of maternal COVID -19 on the pregnancy . No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron pregnancy feeding. Information: Use in immunocompromised patients Risk-benefit impact The safet y profile of the vaccine is not known in immunocompromised individuals due to their exclusion from the pivotal clinical study . The efficacy of the vaccine may be lower in immunocompromised individuals , thus decreasing their protection from COVID -19.Two non-interventional studies C4591021 and C4591024 (former Safet y and immunogenicit y in high-risk adults)] to evaluate the safet y, tolerability, and immunogenicit y of vaccine candidate BNT162b2 in immunocompromised participants 2 years of age are ongoing . 11Study C4591015 iscompleted w ith -5 lower individuals. Two additional observational studies (C4591051 and C4591052) to assess the association between COVID -19 bivalent Omicron -modified Vaccin e and safet y events of interest among also immunocompromised patients are planned . Missing Information: Use in frail patients with co-morbidities ( eg.chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders ) Risk-benefit impact There is limited information on the safet y of the vaccine in frail patients with co -morbidities who are potentiall y at higher risk of severe COVID -19. Missing Information: Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders Risk-benefit impact There is limited information on the safet y of the vaccine in individuals with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders and a theoretical concern that the vaccine may exacerbate their underly ing disease. Missing Information: Interaction with other vaccines Risk-benefit impact COVID -19mRNA vaccine will be used in individuals who also may receive other vaccines. Studies to determine if co -administration of COVID -19mRNA vaccine with other vaccines may affect the efficacy or saf ety of either vaccine have not been performed. One protocol study (C4591030 -Co-administration study with seasonal influenza vaccine ) is completed . Missing Information: Long term safety data Risk-benefit impact The long -term safet y of COVID -19mRNA vaccine is unknown at present, however further safet y data arebeing collected in ongoing Study C4591001 for up to 2 y ears following administration of dose 2 of COVID -19mRNA vaccine and 2 non -interventional studies are ongoing (C4591036 and C4591038 ). Two additional planned observational studies (C4591051 and C4591052) will capture safet y events in individuals of any age who received the COVID -19 bivalent Omicron -modified Vaccine + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 125SVII.2. New Safety Concerns and Reclassification with a Submission of an Updated RMP In accordance with CHMP positive op inion (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0087) received on 10 March 2022 and based on the accumulation of post -authorization safety information, anaph ylaxis has been removed as an IIR in the list of safet y concerns because anaph ylaxis is a known risk of vaccines that is understood by HCPs who administer vaccines and patients anddoes not considerably impact the benefit/risk profile of the vaccine. Product labeling and standards of medical care during the vaccination procedure provide adequate risk mitigation . In accordance with the preliminary PSUR assessment report (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010898/202212) received on 12 May 2023, the important potential risk VAED/VAERD isremoved from the list of safety concerns of the RMP ,as the available cumulative data (clinical trial and post -marketing data) showed no safet y information that substantiates retaining VAED/VAERD as an important potential risk. VAED/VAERD willcontinue to be monitor edthrough routine pharmacovigilance . SVII.3. Details of Important Identified Risks , Important Potential Risks, and Missing Information SVII.3.1. Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential Risks SVII.3.1.1. Important Identified Risk: Myocarditis and P ericarditis Table 58.Myocarditis and Pericarditisa Potential m echanisms, evidence source and strength of evidence A mechanism of action (MOA) by which the vaccine could cause myocarditis and pericarditis has not been established. Nonclinical studies, protein sequence analyses and animal studies in rats and non -human primates have not identified a MOA. Hypotheses for MOA include an immune stimulated response (including the possibility of molecular mimicry), a general systemic inflammatory response from vaccination or a hypersensitivity response. Participants 5 to < 12 years of age The MMWR189issued on 01 April 2022, estimated the incidence of myocar ditis and pericarditis after infection, MIS and vaccination using EHR data from 40 US health care systems participating in PCORnet, the National Patient -Centered Clinical Research Network (7) for the period January 1, 2021 -January 31, 2022. In this study, 27% of -1273 (Moderna) vaccine and 73% received BNT162b2 (Pfizer -BioNTech) vaccine. In the unspecified dose cohort, 36% received Moderna and 64% Pfizer - BioNTech. In the any dose cohort, 29% received Moderna and 71% Pfizer -BioNTech. Dos es specified as booster doses w ere excluded. Among males aged 5 -11 years, the incidences of myocarditis and myocarditis or pericarditis using a 7 and 21-day window were 0 -4 after the first vaccine dose, 0 after the second dose, and 12.6 -17.6 cases per 100,000 after infection. Among females aged 5 -11 years, there w ere no cases of myocarditis or pericarditis after vaccination; incidences of myocarditis and myocarditis or pericarditis w ere 5.4 -10.8 cases per 100,000 after infection. Because there were no or fe w cases of myocarditis or pericarditis after vaccination, the RRs for several comparisons could not be calculated or w ere not statistically significant. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) presented data at a VRBPAC meeting on 14 June 2022 on the number of myocarditis cases within 7 days and 8 -21 days of vaccination per million doses from spontaneous reports through 26 May 2022 in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)190. In children 5 -17 years of age, 54.8 million Pfizer -BioNTech doses were administered (including 3.8 million booster [third] doses). In general, the reporting rates were higher 0 -7 days after vaccination than after 8-21 BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 June 2023 Page 126Table 58.Myocarditis and Pericarditisa days across age groups and sexes. In the 0 -7-day risk interval post dose 2, the crude reporting rates were highest in ages 16 -17 years follow ed by 12-15 years and lowest for 5 -11 years. For persons 5 -11 years of age, the reporting rates in the 0 -7-day risk interval were (per 1 million doses administered): 0.2 post dose 1, 2.6 post dose 2, and 0 post booster in males; 0.2 post dose 1, 0.7 post dose 2, and 0 post booster in females. The reporting rates were slightly elevated post dose 2 in males, compar ed with the estimated background rates (0.2-2.2 per 1 -million -person days in the 0-7-dayinterval). No excess cases were numerically estimated by authors in this analysis . Data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) active surveillance network shared publicly by the CDC on 14 June 2022 show ed the incidence rates of chart confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis treated in emergency department or inpatient settings within 0 -7 days post mRNA COVID -19 primary series and booster through 28 May 2022. The occur rence of myocarditis and pericarditis w as rare (n=3 post dose 2) based on approximately 800,000 doses administered in children 5 -11 years of age, and low est of the other reported age groups (12 -15 and 16 -17 years). The reported incidence rates per million doses administered 0 -7 days post vaccination had w ide reported confidence intervals (males, 15.2 [95% CI 3.1 -44.5]; females, 0 [95% CI 0 - 15.6]), suggesting instability and low precision . Hause et al provided an analysis of safety of BNT162b2 vaccination a mong US children 5 -11 years of age using 3 vaccine safety monitoring systems: v -safe (a voluntary smartphone -based system that monitors reactions and health effects), VAERS (the national spontaneous reporting system co -managed by CDC and Food and Drug Admi nistration [FDA]), and VSD (an active surveillance system that monitors electronic health records for prespecified events, including myocarditis). 191The estimated exposure in this age group at the date of the report w as >16 million vaccine doses. In VAERS, the report ing rate of verified myocarditis during days 0 -7 after dose 2 was substantially lower among males ages 5 -11 years (2.2 per 1 million doses administered) than males ages 12 -15 years (45.7 per 1 million doses administered). In weekly sequential analyses of V SD data, no signal for an increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination was found. Participants 12 to 15 years of age As per MMWR189(01 April 2022), among males aged 12 -17 years, the incidences of myocarditis and myocarditis or pericarditis w ere 2.2 -3.3 after the first vaccine dose, 22.0 -35.9 after the second dose, and 50.1-64.9 cases per 100,000 after infection. RRs for cardiac outcomes comparing infected persons with first dose recipients were 4.9 -69.0, and w ith second dose recipients, were 1.8-5.6; all RRs w ere statistically significant. Among females aged 12 -17 years, incidences of myocarditis or pericarditis w ere 2.0 after the first vaccine dose, 2.1 -5.4 after the second vaccine dose, and 24.7 -35.7 after infection. RRs for cardiac outcomes comparing infected persons with first dose recipients were 25.7 -19.8, and w ith second dose recipients, were 2.5-2.2; all RRs were statistically significant. In a prospective nationwide multicenter study from Denmark192among individuals 12 -17 years of age, the study revealed an incidence of 97 males and 16 females with myocarditis following COVID -19 vaccination per million. During the first 12 months of the COVID -19 era, the incidence of MIS -C and elevated troponin was 355 and 187 per million male and female adolescents (12 -17 years) infected with SARS -CoV -2 (1 in 2800 m ales and 1 in 5300 females), significantly higher than the incidence of myopericarditis after COVID - 19 vaccination in both males and females (Fisher's ex act test; P < 0.01). In another Danish population -based cohort study193, vaccination with BNT162b2 w as associated with a significantly increased rate of myocarditis or myopericarditis among women only -in the 12 -39 years age group, the absolute rate was 1.6 (95% CI 1.0 - 2.6) per 100 000 female individuals aged 12 -39 years within 28 days of vaccination. In the overall BNT1 62b2 cohort, the absolute rate w as 1.4 (1.0 -1.8) per 100,000 vaccinated individuals within 28 days, and among individuals aged 12 -17 years, the rate was 1.0 (0.2 to 3.0) per 100 000 individuals within 28 days of BNT162b2 vaccination. In this study, clinica l outcomes of myocarditis or myopericarditis w ere predominantly mild and generally similar betw een vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, although precision in describing clinical outcomes was limited owing to few events.BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 June and Pericarditisa In evaluation of 404,407 with BNT162b2 in Israel, Mevorach et al194estimated the risk of myocarditis among male recipients in the 21 days after the first and second doses of 0.56 cases per 100,000 after the first dose and 8.09 cases per 100,000 after the second dose; the risk estimates among female recipients were 0 cases per 100,000 after the first dose and 0.69 cases per 100,000 after the second dose. The risk of myocarditis after receipt of the second vaccine dose among male adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was estimated to be 1 case per 12,361; the corresponding risk among female adolescents was estim ated to be 1 case per 144,439. In this study, all the cases were clinically mild, involving a mean duration of hospitalization of 3.1 days (range, 1 to 6) and no readmissions during 30 days of follow -up. Booster Dose (Participants 12 to 15 years of age) The most recent estimates for myocarditis and pericarditis follow ing booster dose administration and with inclusion of p aediatric age groups were presented publicly by the US CDC on 7 June 2022 and 14 June 2022 at VRBPAC meetings and concerned data from VA ERS and VSD .190 The VAERS ana lyses concerned data as of 26 May 2022 and included an estimated 93.4 million booster (third) doses of mRNA vaccines in people 18 years of age or older, and 3.8 million booster (third) doses of BNT162b2 in children 12 -17 years of age. The reporting rates o f myocarditis at 0 -7 day s were 15.3, 24.1, 9.9, and 4.8 per million booster doses in males 12 -15, 16 -17, 18 -24, and 25 -29 years of age, respectively, with rates being lower than those reported post dose 2 in the same age groups and risk period (46.4, 75.9, 38.9, and 15.2, respectively). The reporting rates of myocarditis 0 -7 day s post -booster dose did not exceed estimated background incidence for the period in males 30 years of age or older, and in females of any age presented. The analysis of US VSD190reported the incidence rates of chart confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis treated in emergency department or inpatient settings within 0 -7 days post mRNA COVID -19 primary series and booster through 28 May 2022 for paediatric age groups. The exposure (ie, doses administered) in the VSD dataset w as substantially lower than the overall national exposure utilized for the VAERS estimates above (ie, for children 12 17 years of age, there were 249,775 booster doses in VSD compared to 3.8 million booster doses in VAERS estimates). The number of verified myocarditis and/or pericarditis events in the 0- 7-dayrisk interval following boosters in 12 -17 years was <10 in males or females, rendering wide reported confidence intervals and therefore a degree of uncertainty in the reported incidences; the data w ill be surveilled as it accumulates and is disclosed publicly. In a 20 April 2022195presentation of VDS data through 12 April 2022 of people 12 -39 years of age, the incidence rates of chart confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis tr eated in emergency department or inpatient settings within 0 -7 day s post mRNA COVID -19 prim ary series and booster w ere compared to 22 to 42 days after the corresponding vaccine exposure. Myocarditis rates were approximately halved follow ing the booster (third) dose of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine than those following the primary series (with overlapping confidence intervals) for ages 12 -39 years: 41.4 per million doses (33.1 -51.1) after BNT162b2 primary series vs 21.4 per million dose (12.7 -33.8) after BNT162b2 booster. Similarly, in the US publication by Kuehn et al, myocarditis occurrence after booster doses administered to adolescents was estimated by analysing VAERS system and v -safe reports received between 09 December 2021 and 20 February 2022.196 During the study period, roughly 2.8 million US adolescents received a BNT162b2 booster dose. The confirmed myocarditis rate after a booster dose w as 11.4 per 1 million administered doses among adolescent boys 12 -17 years of age. By comparison, the myocarditis rate after the second dose in the primary vaccine series was 70.7 per 1 million among individuals 12 -15 years of age and 105.9 per 1 million doses among ind ividuals 16 -17 years of age. Participants 16 years of age and older As per MMWR189(01 April 2022), among males aged 18 -29 years, the incidences of myocarditis and myocarditis or pericarditis w ere 2.7 -8.1 after the first vaccine dose, 12.1 -15.0 after the second dose, and 85.5 - 100.6 cases per 100,000 after infection. RRs for cardi ac outcomes comparing infected persons with first dose recipients were 31.8 -12.5, and w ith second dose recipients, were 7.0 -6.7; all RRs were statistically BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 June 2023 Page 128Table 58.Myocarditis and Pericarditisa significant. Among males aged 30 years or older, the incidences of myocarditis and myocarditis or pericarditis w ere 3.8 -7.3 after the first vaccine dose, 3.1 -7.3 after the second dose, and 100.2 -114.0 cases per 100,000 after infection. RRs for cardiac outcomes comparing infected persons with first dose recipients were 26.6-15.6, and with second dose reci pients, were 32.3 -15.6. Among females aged 18 -29 incidences of myocarditis or pericarditis w ere 2.5 -4.6 after the first vaccine dose, 3.1 -5.2 after the second vaccine dose, and 23.8-33.6 after infection. RRs for cardiac outcomes comparing infected p ersons with first dose recipients were 9.4 -7.4, and w ith second dose recipients, w ere 7.6 -6.4. Among females aged 30 years or older, incidences of myocarditis or pericarditis w ere 3.1 -6.2 after the first vaccine dose, 1.7 -4.1 after the second vaccine dose , and 53.8 -61.7 after infection. RRs for cardiac outcomes comparing infected persons with first dose recipients were 17.1 -10.0, and w ith second dose recipients, were 31.2 -14.9. The estimates in this study are similar to previous reports by CDC. An HCO study from Israel197found a RR for myocarditis after vaccination of 3.24 (95% CI, 1.55 -12.44; RD 2.7 events per 100,000 persons [95% CI 1.0 to 4.6]) compared w ith unvaccinated group. The study did not provide age and gender specific stratification s, but it reports that in the vaccinated group with myocarditis, the median age was 25 years (interquartile range, 20 to 34), and 90.9% w ere male. The same study found an excess risk of myocarditis of 11 events per 100,000 persons after SARS -COV -2 infectio n. Tw o further studies from Israel reported similar results. Witberg et al.198observed a small excess in events 3 -5 days following the second dose of BNT162b 2 vaccine, but most were mild presentations and just one classified as fulminant. Mevorach et al.194observed an incidence ratio of 5.34 for myocarditis in 5,442,696 persons following BNT162b2, although this was attenuated when restricted to the definite and probable cases of myocarditis. Risk of myocarditis was restricted to males under the age of 40 ye ars and only observed following the second dose. In a self -controlled case series study of over 38 million people aged 16 or older vaccinated for COVID -19 in England between 1 December 2020 and 24 August 2021199, authors estimated an extra one (95% CI 0, 2) myocarditis event per 1 million people vaccinated with BNT162b2 in the 28 days following a first dose and with an extra 40 (95% CI 38, 41) myocarditis events per 1 million patients in the 28 days following a SARS - CoV -2 positive test. The association with the second dose was not significant for BNT162b2 (IRR 1.3 [95% CI 0.98 -1.72]). The risk was higher in participants aged under 4 0 years, with an estimated 2 (95% CI 1, 3) and 3 (95% CI 2, 4) excess cases of myocarditis per 1 million people receiving a first or second dose of BNT162b2; and 10 (95% CI 7, 11) extra cases of myocarditis following a SARS -CoV -2 positive test in the same age group. Booster Dose (Participants 16 years of age and older) Using US VAERS data of adults aged 18 years who have met the myocarditis case definition following administration of 81.2 million COVID -19 m RNA booster doses in the United States between 22 September 2021 through 6 February 2022, the US CDC found the rate of myocarditis following BNT162b2 to be highest in males aged 18 -24 years (4.1 per 1 million booster doses). The rates for other age groups and females were low (or null).191 Two studies from Israel r eport incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis after booster dose. Aviram et al200 report that 11,905 recipients >18 years who have received a booster dose throughout August 2021, there w ere 4 cases of myocarditis: all male and young (21 -38 years). Three out of 4 patients presented a notable medical history, of which 1 had prior myocarditis episodes (2014 - 2015 presumably associated with a viral infection), and one patient had a history of childhood long QT and genetic m utation in keratin 16 gene; the clinical course was uneventful in all 4 patients. The second study evaluated military personnel in Israel201vaccinated with a third dose of BNT162b2 until Septem ber 30, 2021, and diagnosed with myocarditis up to October 14, 2021, found the incidence rates of myocarditis in the week and 2 w eeks following a third vaccine dose were 3.17 (95% CI, 0.64 -6.28) and 5.55 (95% 100 000 vaccines given, resp ectively. Because all myocarditis cases were in young men (18 -24 years old), authors estimated the incidence for this specific population to be 6.43 (95% CI, 0.13 -12.73) and 11.25 (95% CI, 2.92 -19.59) per 100,000 vaccines given in the week and 2 w eeks aft er a third vaccine dose, respectively.BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 to <5 years of age Data from the CT dataset C4591048 Substudy B Myocarditis and Pericarditis were not observed in any participant through the cut -off date of 25 November 2022.

Surveillance will continue. Risk factors and risk groups Post-authorization reports have been received for more males than females, over a w ide age range and following dose 1 and dose 2 of the vaccine. Evaluation by the EU and US CDC has found reports to be most frequent in adolescent and young adult male patients following the second dose of vaccine. The disease course is self -limit ing in a vast majority of cases: 95% of patients show a rapid resolution of symptoms and normalization of cardiac biomarkers, electro -and echocardiographic findings within days.202 Cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest or death w ere not found significantly associated with the vaccine.197,203 Importantly, the available data suggest that the incidence rate of myocarditis in the context of COVID -19 is much greater than the risk of myocarditis following vaccination. Preventability Healthcare professional should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis in vaccine recipients. Impact on the risk -benefit balance of the biologic product The vaccine continues to have a favourable risk benefit balance. Public h ealth impact Considering the low rates of myocarditis and pericarditis reported follow ing vaccination, balanced w ith the risk of death and illness (including myocarditis) caused by SARS -CoV -2, the public health impact of post - vaccination myocarditis and pericarditis is minimal. a.Search criteria: the following PTs w ere used to retrieve cases of Myocarditis and Pericarditis: BC criteria is no longer appli ed; please refer to vaccine specific summary safety reports and periodic aggregate reports for further information on the characteristics of the post -marketing cases. b.Please note that CT dataset from the safety database includes only cases reporting SAEs. c.Includes cases where age in years w as provided or where age w as not provided, and age group w as equal to child.

Presentation of the Missing Information Table 59.Use in Pregnancy and while Breast Feeding Evidence source: The safety profile of the vaccine is not yet fully known in pregnant or breastfeeding women due to their initial exclusion from the pivotal clinical study. There may be pregnant women who choose to be vaccinated. It isimportant to follow these women for pregnancy and birth outcomes. The timing of vaccin ation in a pregnant w oman and the subsequent immune response may have varying favourable or unfavourable impacts on the embryo/f oetus. The clinical consequences of SARS -CoV -2 infection to the woman and f oetus during pregnancy arenot yet fully understood but some data ha vesuggested that pregnant women have an increased risk of severe disease and complications when affected by COVID -19. This information should be considered in the benefit -risk consideration for vaccination in pregnancy. Population in need of further characterization : The lack of data is communicated in product labelling ; for clinical study of the safety and immunogenicity of COVID -19 m RNA vaccine in pregnant w omenand while breast feeding ,see PARTIII.2 and PART III.3. Table 60.Use in Immunocompromised Patients Evidence source: The vaccine has not been studied in individuals with overt immunocompromised conditions. Therefore, further safety data will be sought in this population. Population in need of further characterisation: Safety data will be collected in individuals with compromised immune function due to acquired or genetic conditions or conditions requiring the use of immunosuppressants as this population of individuals in the active surveillance studies and the clinical stud iesproposed by the MA H(seePART III.2 in Frail Patients with Co-morbidities ( e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders ) Evidence source: The vaccine has been studied in individuals with stable chronic diseases ( e.g., hypertension, obesity) however ,it has not been studied in frail individuals with severe co -morbidities that may compromise the immune function due to the condition or treatment of the condition . Therefore, further safety data will be sought in this popu lation. Population in need of further characterisation: Safety data will be collected in individuals who are frail due to age or debilitating disease in the active surveillance studies and through routine pharmacovigilance (see PART III.2 andPART III.3). Table 62.Use in Patients with Autoimmune or Inflammatory Disorders Evidence source: There is limited information on the safety of the vaccine in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. Population in need of further characterisation: Safety data will be collected in individuals with autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases, including those who may be on immunosuppressants in the active surveillance studies (see PARTIII.2 and PART III.3).BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 135Table 63.Interaction with other Vaccines Evidence source: There are no data on interaction of COVID -19mRNA vaccine with other vaccines at this time. Population in need of further characterisation : All reports describing interactions of COVID -19 vaccine with other vaccines per national recommen dations in individuals will be collected and analysed as per routine PV activities. Interactions with commonly used non-COVID -19 vaccines, such as influenza vaccine, are proposed to be studied in a future clinical study (see PART III.2 andPART III.3). Table 64.Long Term Safety Data Evidence source: At this time, 6-month post dose 2 safety data are available for all patients who have received COVID -19 mRNA vaccine in Study C4591001. The study is ongoing. Anticipated risk/consequence of missing information: At the time of vaccine availability, the long -term safety of COVID -19 mRNA vaccine is not fully known, however there are no known risks with a potentially late onset . Data will continue to be collected from participants in ongoing study C4591001 for up to 2 years follow ing the 2nddose of vaccine.

PHARMACOVIGILANCE PL AN (INCLUDING POST - AUTHORISATION SAFETY STUDIES) III.1. Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities Routine pharmacovigilance activities for the lifecycle of a product are a critical component to the detection, assessment, understanding and mitigation of risks . Objectives of routine pharmacovigilance include having processes in place to assure the ongoing and timely collection, processing , follow -up, and anal ysis of individual AE reports and aggregate data globall y, following global safet y Standard Operating Procedures and regulatory guidance. Pfizer, on behalf of the MA H,monitors the safety profile of its products, evaluates issues potentially impacting product benefit -risk profiles in a timely manner, and ensures that appropriate communication of relevant safet y information is convey ed in a timely manner to regulatory authorities and other interested parties as appropriate and in accordance with international principles and prevailing regulations. Pfizer, on behalf of the MA H, gathers data for signal detection and evaluation commensurate with product characteristics. Routine pharmacovigilance activities bey ond the receipt and review of individual AE reports (e.g.,ADRs) include: Data Capture Aids have been created for this vaccine. They are intended to facilitate the capture of clinical details about : Potential multisy stem inflammatory syndrome in children and adults (MIS -C/A) experienced b y individuals following administration of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID - 19 Vaccine. The DCA is provided in Annex 4 . Signal detection activities for the lifecy cle of vaccines consist of individu al AE assessment at case receipt, regular aggregate review of cases for trends and statistically disproportionately reported product -adverse event pairs. Aggregated and statistical reviews of data are conducted utilizing Pfizer's software interactive tools . Safety signal evaluation requires the collection, anal ysis and assessment of information to evaluate potential causal associations between an event and the product and includes subsequent qualitative or quantitative characteri sation of the relevant safe ty risk to determine appropriate continued pharmacovigilance and risk mitigation actions. Signal detection activities for the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine occur on a weekl y basis. In addition, observed versus expected anal yses will be conducted as appropriate as part of routine signal management activity . Routine signal detection activities for the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine will include routine and specific review of AEs consistent with the AESI list provided in PART II.SVII.1.1 -Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP. In addition, published literature is reviewed weekly for individual case reports and broader signal detection purposes. Regulatory authority safety alerts monitoring .BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Page 137Theweb-based AE reporting portal www.pfizersafety reporting.com will be available for vaccine providers (e .g.,pharmacists, nurses, physicians, and others who administer vaccines) and recipients, to assist with anticipated high volume of reports (based on expectations of a large target population for vaccination). The portal will capture key adverse event data in the initial interaction and will provide automated intake into the Pfize r safet y database via E2B for safety review. At the country level, the Pfizer Drug Safet y Units perform routine pharmacovigilance activities including the collection of AEs from various sources and the reporting of AEs to the regulatory authority as per lo cal regulatory guidelines. The serious adverse event (SAE)/ product complaint (PC) Joint Report for Sterile I njectables is run monthly . In addition, the AE/PC Joint report and the AE/PC L ot/Lot profile Report is run quarterl y and is a statistical report t hat identifies an y data that could constitute a safet y signal over time. The AE/PC L ot/Lot Profile report complements the monthly AE trending performed b y Safety and the monthly PC trending performed b y Product Quality . Summary safety reports The submissi on of summary safety reports complemented the submission of 6 monthly PSURs. The need and frequency of such reports ha vebeen re -evaluated based on the available evidence from post -marketing experience and since 15 April 2022 (DLP of the last report) SSRsare no longer required by EMA as per the final PRAC Assessment Report for PAM -MEA -002.13 EMA/PRAC/577594/2022) dated 0 8June 2022 . Potential Medication Errors This section is applicable to all formulations presented in the RMP. Large scale public health approaches for mass vaccination may represent changes to standard vaccination process es, thereby potentiall y increasing the risk of medication errors related to: dilution and administration, vaccination scheme, storage conditions, use of a multi -dose vial, availability of different formulations and multiple presentations , and confusion with other COVID vaccines. These potential medication errors are mitigated through the information in the SmPC and available resources and referenced materials for healthcare providers and individuals receiving vaccination . The EU SmPC (section 6.6)contains instructions for vaccine dilution and administration, vaccination dosing , and storage conditions forthe formulations of the COVID -19 mR NA vaccine. Reference poster swith step -by-step instruction for vaccine storage, vial differentiation, dose planning and preparation, and administration areavailable, and can be conspicuously display ed in vaccination settings for ongoing reference. Reference b rochures for safe handling of the vaccine and dry ice will accompany vaccine shipments.BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 138Dosing card which provides information for vaccine storage, vial differentiation, dose planning, and administration is available, for healthcare provider reference . Medical information call centers areavailable for healthcare providers to obtain information on use of the vaccine. Patient Traceability and Vaccination Reminder card (Annex 7 ) will be provided with the pre -printed manufacturer name, placehold er spaces for dates of vaccination s and batch/ lot number sas a mitigation effort for potential confusion between vaccines. (See Traceability for additional details) . These available resources will inform healthcare providers on the proper preparation and administration of various formulations of the vaccine and reduce the potential for medication error in the context of a mass vaccination campaign. In addition, HCP's will receive communication to inform of availability of these resources and/or new vaccine presentations, when applicable. Additionally , the patient information leaflet and Traceability and Vaccination Reminder card informs patients of the vaccine received so that a series is completed with the same product.

Various resources and referenced resources to inform HCPs on the proper preparation and differentiation will be available. Traceability The SmPC, includes instructions for healthcare professionals: to clearl y record the name and batch number of the administered vaccine to improve traceability (section 4.4) .BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 144to report an y suspected adverse reactions including batch/L ot number if available (section 4.8). Traceability is available for every shipping container of COVID mRNA vaccine, which are outfitted with a unique device that provides real -time monitoring of geogr aphic location and temperature 24 hours per day , 7 day s per week. Each device will also trace the batch/lot of the associated shipment. The device is activated prior to shipment and information is transmitted wirelessly to Pfizer at a predefined cadence, on behalf of the MA H, until delivery to the vaccinator's practice site. A shipment quality report that indicates if the product is acceptable for immediate use is generated b y Pfizer on behalf of the MA Hand transmitted to the vaccinator's practice site upon pressing of the stop button on the data logger, or arrival notification from the carrier in combination with the data loggers location and/or light signal. Additionally , alarms and escalation/notifi cation for excursions (per pre -defined specifications) are programmed into the device. These data may be used for the assessment of a safety signal. The vaccine carton labelling also contains a 2 -D barcode which has the batch/lot and expiry embedded withi n, should there be capabilit y at a vaccination site to utilize this as an information source. Further, Pfizer on behalf of the MA H, provides Traceability and Vaccination Reminder cards (Annex 7 ) to vaccinators that may be completed at the time of vaccinat ion. The Traceabilit y and Vaccination Reminder cards contain the following elements: Placeholder space for name of vaccinee; Vaccine brand name and manufacturer name; Placeholder space for due date and actual date of first and second doses, and associated batch/lot number ; Reminder to retain the card and bring to the appointment for the second dose of the vaccine; QR code that links to additional information; and Adverse event reporting information . In addition, to the Traceability and Vaccination Reminder cards, two stickers per dose, containing printed batch/lot information and a coloured border corresponding to the associated vials for the dose, weremade available to support document ation of the batch/lot on the Traceability and Vaccination Reminder card and vaccinee medical records in mass vaccination centers. We also acknowledge that some EU member states may require utilisation of nationally mandated vaccination cards or electronic s ystems to document batch/lot number; therefore, the available Traceability and Vaccination Reminder cards and stickers with printed lot/batch information may not be utilized in all member states . BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 145The following milestones are proposed for the availability of the stickers with printed lot/batch information : Initial vaccine availability: Sufficient quantities of blank \"Traceability and Vaccination Reminder cards\" w eremade available to vaccinators in the member states where utili sation of a nationall y mandated vaccination card is not required. 29January 2021: In addition to the blank \"Traceability and Vaccination Reminder cards\", stickers with printed lot/batch information weremade available to vaccinators at large scale (1000 subjects/day ), mass vaccination sites in the member states where the national authority has not mandated another mechanism for documenting the lot/batch information. Projected 2022: Upon development and approval of single -dose vials, pre -printed batch/lot stickers will be available to co -ship with each vaccine shipment. Cold -Chain Handling and Storage Multiple modalities will be utili sed for quality assurance throughout shipment due to the required ultra -cold storage for COVID -19 mRNA vaccine. Each shipment of the vaccine is outfitted with a unique device that provides real -time monitoring of geographic location and temperature 24 hour s per day , 7 day s per week until delivery to a vaccinator's practice site. Alarms and escalation/notification to Pfizer on behalf of the MA Hand/or to the recipient for excursions (per pre -defined specifications) are programmed into the device. Additionall y, a shipment quality report that indicates if the product is acceptable for immediate use is generated by Pfizer and transmitted to the vaccinator's practice site. Joint adverse event and product complaint (including available batch/lot information) trend ing reviews occur routinely with Global Product Quality . Additionally , available resources and referenced materials for vaccinators will include information regarding proper handling of the shipment container as temporary storage, and handling/disposal of dry ice until the received shipment is either placed into an ultra -low temperature freezer or is maintained in accord with pre -defined specifications in the shipment container as temporary storage (i .e.,upon receipt of the shipment quality report noted ab ove), as appropriate.

Non-Interventional Post Approval Safety Studies (9) The MA Hproposes 9 complementary studies of real -world safet y of COVID -19 mRNA vaccine that use multiple data sources and study designs. These are described in Table 69 below which includes the proposed post -approval safet y studies that will be conducted in the EU and US. Study C4591021 is a Comirnaty safet y surveillance study conducted in collaboration with University Medical Center Utrecht on behalf of Vaccine Monitoring Collaboration for Europe Consortium research team VAC4EU and based on the master surveillance protocol. Additionally ( formerl yknown as the C4591021 substudy ) is also a collaboration with University Medical Center Utrecht o n behalf of VAC4EU Consortium research team and is designed as a substudy of C4591021 to assess the natural history of post -vaccination m yo-/pericarditis, e.g., recovery status (using medical record review) and/or identification of serious cardiovascular outcomes (using existing structured data) within 1 y ear of m yo-/pericarditis diagnosis among occurring in individuals vaccinated with COMI RNATY as well as individuals not vaccinated with a COVID -19 vaccine. Study C4591051 is a Comirnaty Original /Omicron BA.4 -5 safet y surveillance study to be conducted using secondary data from administrative claims and electronic health records from data research partners participating in the US Sentinel Sy stem. Study C4501052 is BA.4 -5 safety surveillance study conducted in collaboration with University Medical Center Utrecht on behalf of Vaccine Monitoring Collaboration for Europe Consortium research team VAC4EU and based on the master surveillance protoco l. In addition to the studies in the EU, in support of the US BLA and sBLA application s, Pfizer will conduct 4US studies and 1 US/CA for safet y surveillance of COVID 19 mRNA. include:BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 1481 study using secondary data from administrative claims/ electronic medical records for military and civilian personnel and their families in the Department of Defense Military Health Sy stem (C4591011 ). 1 study using secondary data from EHR of patients included in the Veterans Healthcare Administration sy stem (C 4591012). 1 study using secondary data from administrative claims and electronic health records from data research partners participating in the US Sentinel Sy stem (C4591009). 1 low-interventional study using primary data from the Pediatric Heart Network (PHN), a NIH -funded consortium of leading research hospitals across the US, Canada, and other countries that conducts research in cardiovascular disease, to characterize the clinical course, risk fa ctors, long -term sequelae, and quality of life in children and young adults <21 years with acute post -vaccine m yocarditis over a 5-yearperiod (C4591036). 1 study will monitor rates of pregnancy and infant outcomes in planned and unplanned pregnancies exp osed to BNT162b2 using an established pregnancy registry . Women receiving BNT162b2 during pregnancy will be followed from exposure to one -year post -partum. Anal yses will be conducted to evaluate if the pregnant women receiving the vaccine during pregnancy experience increased risk of pregnancy and infant outcomes compared with pregnant women who are unvaccinated (C4591022) . The protocols for the safety studies in the US ( C4591009, C4591011 ,C4591012 and C4591022 ) were 3 Part C . Non-Interventional Post -Approval Safety Studies Assessing C4591009 (US) , C4501051 (US) and C4501052 (EU) will describe the incidence of my ocarditis/pericarditis following Comirnaty vaccination overall, and stratified by age group, gender, race/ethnicity (if feasible), dose, and risk interval using structured information and following case confirmation via med ical record review where feasible. To assess the magnitude of risk, these studies include comparative methods (self -controlled anal yses, and anal yses involving a separate comparator group). Relative risk (RR) estimates from comparative analy ses will be o btained overall and stratified by the same factors as described above when supported by sufficient cell counts. To evaluate long -term outcomes, my ocarditis/pericarditis -specific anal ytic endpoints C4591038 (former C4591021 the natural history of post -vaccination myo-/pericarditis, e.g., recovery status (medical record review) and/or identification of serious cardiovascular outcomes (structured data) with in 1 y ear of m yo-/pericarditis BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 149diagnosis among individuals vaccinated with COMI RNATY as well as individuals not vaccinated with a COVID -19 vaccine. Study C4591021 will also estimate the time trend, in relation to DHPC letter dissemination, of the proporti on of individuals who received real -world clinical assessments for myocarditis/pericarditis following Comirnaty vaccination. Along-term primary data collection low-interventional study is C4591036 (former Pediatric Heart Network (PHN), to evaluate the cli nical course, risk factors, long -term sequelae, and quality of life of post -vaccine my ocarditis/pericarditis over a 5 -year period. In addition, protocol sof studies C4591012 and C4591036 have been amended to include evaluat ionofindividuals receiving additional approved do ses, including the bivalent Omicron -modified vaccine . Additionally , the MAH has determined to not update the study C4591021, as accepted by the FDA and committed instead to conduct a standalone post - authorizatio n observational safet y stud y (C4591052) to evaluate bivalent omicron - modified vaccine . Non-Interventional Post -Approval Safety Studies that include paediatric subject saged 5 to < 12 years old Studies C4591021(EU), C4591038 (former C4591021 substudy ) (EU), C4591009 (US) C4591011 (US) and C4591036 (US and Canada) will assess the use of vaccine for the occurrence of safet y events of interest, including myocarditis and pericarditis. Each of these studies includes individuals of all ages, including ages 5 t o <12, except for low-interventional study C4591036, which only includes individuals <21 y ears of age . Non-Interventional Post -Approval Safety Studies in Pregnancy It is anticipated that initial use in pregnancy will be subject to local health authority recommendations regarding which individuals should be vaccinated and likely very limited intentional vaccination of pregnant women; therefore, initially this information will derive from 6of the Table 69. Study C4591012 is focused on patients in the Veterans Health Administration system and is not expected to capture many pregnancies given the demographics of the source population. The findings from studies' interim anal ysis (where planned) will inform a strategy to assess pregnancy outcomes as vaccination in pregnancy expands. The MAHwill consider established EU pregnancy research recommendations such as CONSIGN (COVID -19 infectiOn aNd medicineS I n pre GNancy ) when developing any pregnancy related study objectives (currentl y not listed in Table 69and Table 70). The MA Hagrees that monitoring vaccine safet y in pregnant women is critical. Given that a pregnancy registry based on primary data collection is susceptible to non -participation, attrition, small sample size and limited or lack of comparator data, Pfizer, on beha lf of the MAH, would like to propose monitoring vaccine safet y in pregnancy using electronic health care data, which could be conducted in a representative pregnant woman population exposed BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 150to the vaccine and minimize selection bias, follow -up bias, and re porting bias. In addition, internal comparison groups, such as contemporaneous unvaccinated pregnant women or women receiving other vaccine(s) to prevent COVID -19 (if available) could be included. Post-Approval Effectiveness Studies (3) Pfizer will conduc t, on behalf of the MAA, at least one non -interventional study (test negative design) of individuals presenting to the hospital or emergency room with sy mptoms of potential COVID -19 illness in a real -world setting (C4591014). The effectiveness of COVID -19mRNA vaccine will be estimated against laboratory confirmed COVID -19 illness requiring admission to the ED or hospital where SARS -CoV -2 is identified. Th isstudywill allow determin ation of the effectiveness of Pfizer's vaccine in a real -world setting and against severe disease, and in specific racial, ethnic, and age groups. The purpose of the original study C4591014 (a test -negative design) was further developed with 2 new vaccine effectiveness epidemiology studies not sponsored by Pfizer (WI235284 and WI 255886) added .The harmoni sation of study definitions across these 3 protocols will allow for data and results comparison across study populations to provide a robust evidence base for evaluating the effectiveness of COVID -19 mRNA vaccine following its introduction into the real-world setting .The two studies, C4591014 and WI 255886 ,will also assess the effectiveness of Omicron 151Table 69.Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities Study Number Country (ies)Study Title Study Type Study StatusRationale and Study ObjectivesStudy design Study populations Milestones C4591001 GlobalA Phase 1/2/3, placebo - controlled, randomized, observer -blind, dose - finding study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of SARS -COV -2 RNA vaccine candidates against COVID -19 in healthy individuals.

Rationale for the additional risk minimisation activity:TheDHCP communication is to inform HCPs about the identified risk of myocarditis and pericarditis associated w ith COVID -19 m RNA vaccine, to remind them to be alert ed about the signs and symptoms and to couns el patients to seek immediate medical attention should they experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations . Target audience and planned distribution path:The target audience includes general practitioners, cardiologists, specialists in emergency medicine and vaccination centres , HCPs who vaccinate patients and who provide medical care to patients who receive the vaccine. Target groups should be further defined atnational level, depending on national health care systems . Plans to evaluate t he effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success:Estimating the time trend, in relation to DHPC letter dissemination, of the proportion of individuals who received real -world clinical assessments for myocarditis/pericarditis following Comirn aty vaccination. The DHPC distribution started on 19 July 2021 in all EEA countries as per the EMA's BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 184V.3.

SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN Summary of risk management plan for summary of the risk (RMP) for Comirnaty risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on should be read in the context of all this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain -language summary , all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). Important new concerns or changes to the current one s will be included in updates of Medicine and What It Is Used For Comirnaty is a vaccine for active immuni sation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS - CoV -2 virus, in individuals 6 months of age and indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused b y SARS -CoV -2 virus, in individuals 12 y ears of age and older (BA.1) and 6 months of age and older (BA.4 -5) who have previously received at least a primary vaccination course against COVI D-19(see SmPC for the full indication). Both contain nucleoside -modified messenger RNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles as the active substance and are given intramuscularl y.

II.Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further Characterise the Risks Important risks ofComirnaty ,of measu res to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about risks, are outlined below. Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: Specific Information , such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; Important advice on the medicin e's packaging; Theauthorised pack size \u2014the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the medicine is used correctly ; The medicine's legal status \u2014the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. In addition to these measures, i nformation about adverse e vents is collected continuously and regular lyanalysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary . These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities . If important information that may affect the safe use of Comirnaty ,of micrograms) available, it is listed under 'missing information' below. II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information Important risks of Comirnaty ,of Comirnat micrograms) are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safel y administered. Importan t risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Comirnaty risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refe rs to information on the safet y of the medicinal product that is currentl y missing and needs to be collected (e.g .,on the long -term use of the medicine).BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4 -5 Risk Management Plan June 2023 Page 189Table 74.List of Important Risks and Missing Information Important identified risks Myocarditis and Pericarditis Important potential risks None Missing information Use in pregnancy and while breast feeding Use in immunocompromised patients Use in frail patients with co -morbidities (e.g. ,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders Interaction with other vaccines Long term safety data II.B Summary of Important Risks The safet y information in the Product Information is aligned to the reference .
