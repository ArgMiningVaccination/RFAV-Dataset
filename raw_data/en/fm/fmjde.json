Chronic hepatitis and carrier states are not linked with hepatitis A infection. However, relapsing hepatitis, a condition where a person gets worse again after a period of improvement, can last up to a year in 15% of cases. While most infected people recover, the older you are, the more severe hepatitis A can be. Approximately 25% of infected adults are hospitalized.
