Speaker Notes: BMC implemented a collaborative model to facilitate expansion of MAT in primary care practices Arch Intern Med. 2011;171:425 -431.Speaker Notes: This collaborative care model uses NCM as the team leaders working with waive red physicians in primary care settings. It has been dubbed the Massachusetts Model by SAMHSA BMC's Office Based Addiction Treatment (OBAT) Model Collaborative Care / Nurse Care Manager Model developed atBoston Medical Center (BMC) Nurse care managers (NCMs) work with physicians to deliver outpatientsubstance use treatment withbuprenorphine and injectablenaltrexone More recently dubbed the \"Massachusetts Model\" O B A TSpeaker Notes: The model started with the appr oval of buprenorphine in 2003 from 2003-2010 425 patients were seen with an average of 3-6 admissions a week. Over time 9 physicians became waive red with 1 medical director and 3 addiction ce rtified. Most practices part time with providers typically on average having 3 sessions a week It grew from one nurse to 3 FTE, 1 Medical assistant, program coordinator and program director Boston Medical Center (BMC) OBOT in General Internal Medicine 5/2003 - Began OBOT 7/2010 425 patients (3- 6 admissions per week) 9 physicians 1 medical director 3 ABAM certified Part-time clinical practices: on average, 3 sessions/week (range 1 -6) 3 RNs (3 FTE) 1 medical asst (1 FTE) 1 program coordinator (1 FTE) 1 program director (.4 FTE) Speaker Notes: As of 7/16 there are 7 admissions a week, with 17 waivered physicians and 12 are ABAM certified.. 5.5 RN's medical assistant, .2 coordinator and .1 of program director and >600 active patients Boston Medical Center (BMC) OBOT in General Internal Medicine 7/2016 7 new admissions per week 17 waivered physicians 12 ABAM certified Part-time clinical practices: on average, 3 sessions/week (range 1 -6) RNs (5.5 FTE) medical assistant (1 FTE) program coordinator (.2 FTE) program director (.1 FTE) Treatment retention Successful taper after 6 months of adherence Unsuccessful treatment Patients, No, (%) 196 (51.3) 187 (49.0) 9 (2.4) 162 (42.4) 113 (29.6) Lost to follow-up Nonadherence despite enhanced treatment Administrative discharge due to disruptive behavior Adverse effects of buprenorphine hydrochloride Transfer to methadone hydrochloride treatment program46 (12.0) 2 (0.5) 1 (0.3) 24 (6.3) Table 2. Treatment Outcomes at 12 Months of 382 Opioid-Dependent Patients Entering Office-Based Opioid Treatment in Primary Care Outcome Successful treatment Speaker Notes: A= Adherence was defined as attending scheduled office-based opioid tre atment program appointments, complying with required monitoring (ie,urine drug te sts or pill counts), absence of e vidence of buprenorphine diversion, and lack of sustained illicit opiate use.

Alford, MD, MPH1 Speaker Notes: To address the barriers we surveyed the waivered providers in MA J Gen Intern Med. 2008;23:1393- 1398.Speaker Notes: We learned that providers didn't feel comfortable, had limited knowledge base of addiction and felt they needed clinical and administrative supports to do this... We had addressed these issues in our model in 2003 which was likely a contributing factor to its success Barriers to Prescribing Buprenorphine in Office-Based Settings N=156 waivered physicians; 66% response rate among all SupportInsufficient Nursing Support 55% of waivered providers reported 1 or more barriers Source: Walley et al. J Gen Intern Med. 2008; 23(9): 1393 -1398.Speaker Notes: Only physician have been allowed to prescribe but this is now expanding to NP and PA with the legislative changes under CARA, we are all hopeful this will further expand access to treatment Only DEA WAIVERED physicians can prescribe BUPRENORPHINE. (Not for long!!!!) However... ...it takes a Multidisciplinary Team Approach for effective treatment. Speaker Notes: The N CM model facilitates treatment deals with the day to day issues, manages the follow ups, medical complications, prescriptions, and concrete service issues What MAKES THE BMC NCM OBAT Model SUCCESSFUL? NCMs increase patient access to treatment! Frequent follow- ups Case management Able to address positive urines insurance issues prescription/pharmacy issues Pregnancy, acute pain, surgery, injury Concrete service support Intensive treatment, legal/social issues, safety, housing Brief counseling, social support, patient navigation Support providers with large case loads Speaker Notes: We implemented a statewide TA program in 2007 and supported the the n 14 funded CHC that the stated added NCM modeled after BMC' s model. Putting these in CHC made sense in MA given under the public health service act CHC are required to provide mental health and SUD Treatment This TA program has expanded to now support >30 CHC across the state EXPANSION of BMC OBAT MODEL to Massachusetts CHCs In 2007 State Technical Assistance Treatment Expansion (STATE) OBAT Program created to expand BMC model to community health centers (CHCs) across MA Federally qualified health centers mandated by Public Health Service Act to: 1 Provide mental health and substance use treatment Provide direct services or by written contractual agreement Measure services for effectiveness and quality Program started with 14 CHCs, BMC now provides capacity building to >30 community health providers 1. Public Health Service Act (PHS) 42 U.S. Code, Chap. 6A, \u00a7254bSpeaker Notes: This model has provided expanded access to treatment with a larger pool of waivered providers, increased numbers up to 10,000 being treated in the CHC from 2007-2014 with an integration of addiction care into the chc primary care settings The cente red have used BMC model into these CHC that serve an underserved population in high risk areas Sustainability would be state specific based on funding and reimbursement streams howeve r in addition this can be looked at as a preventive model of care facilitating treatment for a high risk high utilizer population State OBAT INITIATIVE in CHCs: Project Goals Expand treatment & access to buprenorphine ACCESS Increase number of waivered MDs Increase number of individuals treated for opioid use disorder Integrate addiction treatment into primary care settings Effective delivery model for buprenorphine DELIVERY Modeled after BMC's Nurse Care Manager Program Focus on high risk areas, underserved populations Post -program funding SUSTAINABILITY Develop a long -term viable funding plan Collect & analyze outcomes dataJournal of Substance Abuse Treatment Office-Based Opioid Treatment with Buprenorphine (OBOT-B): State- wide Implementation of the Massachusetts Collaborative Care Model in Community Health Centers Colleen T.

Speaker Notes: We published on this model looking at the benefit of expanding tre atment to the CHC using the NCM and providing technical assistance to support the programs Speaker Notes: The e lements of the MA model include a trained coordinator to collect the scre ening information by phone or inperson which is then reviewed by the clinical team, a visit is then booked with the NCM to do a full assessment, send for labs, teaching, treatment agreements and consents followed by an appointment with the waivered provided to assess for appropriate ness . Once the waivered provider signs off the patient is booked for an induction onsite and then stabilized by phone using the trained addiction nurse who follows a protocol BMC OBOT Became K nown as Massachusetts Model of OBOT Program Coordinator intake call Screens the patient over the telephone OBOT Team reviews the case for appropriateness NCM and physician assessments Nurse does initial intake visit and collects data Waivered prescriber: PE, and assesses appropriateness, DSM criteria of opioid use disorder NCM supervised induction (on- site) and managed stabilization (on - and off-site (by phone)) Follows protocol with patient self administering medication per prescriptionSpeaker Notes: Each of the N CM go through a day long training similar to the waiver training but more nuts and bolts of how to do this in an office setting and how to manage the patient in their SUD NCM ensure DEA tracking, collaboration and orders from prescribers, work collaboratively with pharmacists. Manage daily visits, phone issues, drop in, insurance issues.. See 40-75 patients a week depending on the leve l of support Nurse Care Managers (NCM) Registered nurses, completed 1 day buprenorphine training Performed patient education and clinical care by following treatment protocols (e.g., UDT, pill counts, periop mgnt ) Ensured compliance with federal laws Coordinated care with OBOT prescribers Collaborated care with pharmacists (refills management) and off -site counseling services Drop -in hours for urgent care issues Managed all insurance issues (e.g., prior authorizations) On average each NCM saw 75 patients/ wkSpeaker Notes: In the MA model patients reach maintenance phase following 6 months of stability. The NCM visits are weekly for the first 4-6 weeks then decrease in frequency to every other to every third and as needed based on the patients needs ... some may need weekly or more intense longer than others individualized treatment plans. Waivered providers are seen at least every 3- months and more frequently if needed or if the provider wishes to see the patient more Use methadone as a tool if needed for more intense follow up Patient may be discharged if behavior is unsafe, every effort will be made to move t o a more structured supportive setting Massachusetts Model of OBOT Maintenance treatment patient in care (at least 6 months) NCM visits weekly for 4 -6 wks, then q2 wks, then q1 -3 months and as needed Waivered provider visits at least every 4 months Medically supervised withdrawal considered based on stability if the patient requested to taper Transferred to methadone if continued illicit drug use or need for more structured care Discharged for disruptive behaviorSpeaker Notes: UMASS studied the Medicaid data in MA on all patients with an OUD they broke down those on methadone, buprenorphine, an not on medication. In this they found that those on MAT had significantly less ED visit, hospitalization and had decreased cost. In addition it was found that younger patients were more apt to seek out buprenorphine care than methadone maintenance. UMass Study Findings in Massachusetts Studied 5,600 Mass Health Clients prescribed buprenorphine and methadone (2003-2007) Overall Mass Health expenditures lower than for those with no treatment Clients on Medications had significantly lower rates of relapse, hospitalizations and ED visits: no more costly than other treatments Buprenorphine attracting younger and newer clients to treatment Clark RE, Samnaliev M, Baxter JD, Leung GY.

Assessment of new onse t of mental health issues and support with evaluation Medical issues are often important to patients once addiction is being treated, assisting with this Assessing and discussing pregnancy potential Assessing life stability: housing, jobs, family, friends OBOT RN Follow up Visits: Assess dose, frequency, cravings, withdrawal Ongoing education: dosing, side effects, interactions, support. Counseling, self help check in Psychiatric evaluation and follow up as needed Medical issues: vaccines, follow up, treatment HIV, HCV, engage in care Assist with preparing prescriptions Facilitating prior approvals and pharmacy Pregnancy: if pregnant engage in appropriate care Social supports: OBOT, the first 6 months and 7-12 months later when in care patients admissions declined across the 14 sites in MA Hospital Admissions 0.26 0.23 0.20 0.26 0.10 0.100.09 0.10 0.12 0.12 0.12 0.08 2008 2009 2010 2011 Fiscal Year Average Hospital Admissions Per OBOT Enrollment Prior 6 Months Future 6 Months Future 7 to 12 Months Notes: Hospital data is only available through 9/30/2012 Enrollments must have lasted at least 12 months Paid amounts are calculated using hospital specific pay to charge ratios Prepared by Synthesis Health ED visits across the sites: 6 months pre to first 6 months to 7-12 months ER Visits 1.53 1.17 1.17 1.24 0.58 0.690.65 0.67 0.54 0.55 0.62 0.61 2008 2009 2010 2011 Fiscal Year Average ER Visits Per OBOT Enrollment Prior 6 Months Future 6 Months Future 7 to 12 Months Notes: Hospital data is only available through 9/30/2012 Enrollments must have lasted at least 12 months Paid amounts are calculated using hospital specific pay to charge ratios Prepared by Synthesis Health Systems, Inc.Speaker Notes: SUD are impacted by social determinants contributed to biological, socio-economic, and psycho-social status. One's environment plays such an important role in SU and in relapse. Returning someone to their environment often restarts the cycle. Housing is of great importance, as is the ability to get a job, t o find shelter and food, to avoid abuse. A job that is sustainable and provides one with satisfaction... not addressing the mental healh is a huge misstep in repe ating the cycle and bad outcomes Social Determinants Health Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Health determinants contribute to biological, socio -economic and psycho -social status What determines our health Environment: living conditions, shelter, homeless Employment: economic disparities Access to healthcare: insurance, emergency care Social stressors: abuse, neglect, food insecurities Educational disparities: occupation Mental health issues Cultural norms: attitudes, treatment settings, decision- makingSpeaker Notes: In treating addiction we have an opportunity to change the cycle to assist our patients with positive change, to change their environment, obtain a better job, education For everyone to have access to comparable health care Utilizing NCM to support complex disease management in a ddiction can assist with the social determinants of health and improve outcomes Addressing the Causal Chain in SUD Taking into account the patient's cultural framework, address: Supportive housing: environment change Career development: schooling, job training Increase economic opportunities Universal healthcare: Reinforce prevention, treatment Stressors: complex care management Supports: parenting, education, counseling, activities Prevention and education Social connectednessSpeaker Notes: Providing our patie nts with complex care management in SU Treatment improves outcomes and using nurses to do this expands the reach and engages the treatment team allowing everyone to practice at the top of their license and for patients to access evide nce based care when and where they need it. Complex Care Management in OUD Patient -level outcomes comparable to physician- centered approaches Allows efficient use of physician time to focus on patient management (e.g., dose adjustments, maintenance vs. taper) Allowed physicians to managed > numbers of patients due to support of NCM Improved access to OBOT and daily management of complex psychosocial needs (e.g., housing, health insurance) Alford DP , LaBelle CT Med. 2011;171:425 -431.
