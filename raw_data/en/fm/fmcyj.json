You would never have guessed that the vast majority of those who understand the problem are against the bill. The Bill has failed to win the support of The British Medical Association, The Motor Neurone Disease Association, the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Surgeons, the Medical Research Society, the Royal College of Radiologists, The Medical Defence Union, the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Royal College of Pathologists, the Royal College of General Practitioners, the Academy for Healthcare Science, the Wellcome Trust, Action Against Medical Accidents, and patient advocacy charities Health Watch and the Nightingale Collaboration, [and others](http://www.stopthesaatchibill.co.uk/what-do-doctors-lawyers-and-medical-charities-say/). Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, a former GP, has \"very serious concerns\" about it. Grief is not a good basis for legislation. In the Daily Telegraph, Lord Saatchi attributes the lack of a \"cure for cancer\" to fear of litigation. \"Any deviation by a doctor is likely to result in a verdict of guilt for medical negligence. The law defines medical negligence as deviation from that standard procedure. But as innovation is deviation, non-deviation is non-innovation. This is why there is no cure for cancer.\" This statement is utterly bizarre. Evidently Lord Saatchi knows much more about how to sell cigarettes than he does about how to discover new drugs. The reason there is no cure is that it's a very difficult problem. It has nothing to do with litigation Almost every medical organisation, and many lawyers, have pointed out the flaws in his ideas,. But slick, and often mendacious, advertising of his cure has deceived many of our scientifically-illiterate parliamentarians, and the bill is making progress Lord Saatchi's Bill would allow uncontrolled testing of treatments on any patient. It is not limited to cancer, nor to terminally ill patients (though some amendments, yet to be accepted, might change that). This sort of uncontrolled experimentation is likely to impede advances in treatment rather than to help them. And the vagueness of the wording of the bill could lead to an increase in litigation, rather than the intended decrease. It is no coincidence that the [legion of cancer quacks](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5891) is in favour of the bill. It opens the door to their nonsense. Big pharma is likely to benefit too, because they will be able to sell improperly tested drugs with little or no effectiveness and immunity from prosecution if they do harm. For more information about the Bill, see the excellent site, [Stop the Saatchi Bill](http://www.stopthesaatchibill.co.uk/). There are sections on [ Dispelling Myths](http://www.stopthesaatchibill.co.uk/faq-dispelling-myths/), on [Professional Concerns](http://www.stopthesaatchibill.co.uk/what-do-doctors-lawyers-and-medical-charities-say/), and on the many [good articles and blogs](http://www.stopthesaatchibill.co.uk/read-articles-about-the-bill/) that have pointed out the many problems with the bill. Two recent articles are well worth reading [Saatchi's 'Medical Innovation Bill' will benefit lawyers and charlatans, not patients](https://www.opendemocracy.net/ournhs/david-nicholl/saatchi%27s-%27medical-innovation-bill%27-will-benefit-lawyers-and-charlatans-not-pat#.VEevO8uIwrI.twitter), by neurologist David Nicholl. And it's particularly interesting that the Telegraph's arch-conservative, Peter Oborne has come out strongly against the bill, in [The 'Saatchi Bill' is dangerous and will bring nothing but harm. ](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/saatchi-bill/11183012/The-Saatchi-Bill-is-dangerous-and-will-bring-nothing-but-harm.html)I can't agree with his opening words (\"Lord Saatchi is rightly regarded as a national treasure. In his early days he was the advertising genius who played a fundamental role in selling the Thatcherite message\"), but I agree entirely with \"The PR campaign distorts the facts, exploiting ignorance and desperation to plant false hope in the rich soil of multiple fallacies.\" \"Quacks will be given free rein. No \"treatment\" is so loopy (or potentially dangerous) that the Saatchi Bill won't protect doctors who prescribe or administer it from prosecution.\" \"The propagation of falsehoods and fallacies surrounding and arising from this Bill will have a corrosive effect on medical ethics and society as a whole.\" Lord Saatchi, who proposed the bill said \"To prevent more needless cancer deaths, doctors must be free to innovate\". This statement shows he has no idea of the efforts that go into cancer research. We are doing our best, but it is a very hard problem. In some areas (like breast cancer) there have been big advances. In others areas (e.g. pancreatic or ovarian cancer) there has not yet been any perceptible progress. It will take many more years of hard scientific work. Individual doctors tinkering with speculative untested treatments will not solve the problem. - The only people who will benefit from the bill will be lawyers, quacks and big pharma. - \"Innovation\" is undefined -the bill is based on the myth that there exists a miraculous cure waiting to be found. Sadly, the probability of this happening is vanishingly small. - To some extent, medicine is victim of its own hype. The public feels it has a right to demand the latest miracle cure. Too often, they don't exist. - There is no need for the bill because doctors can already prescribe whatever they want. The Medical Defence Union says it has no reason to think that doctors are deterred from innovating by the fear of litigation. - The bill won't help to discover new cures -in fact it is more likely to hinder it, especially if it deters people from joining properly organised clinical trials. The bill will generate many separate anecdotes which may or may not be published. That's the worst possible way to do research. - The bill removes protections from patients and is more likely to increase litigation than reduce it. - Anyone unlucky enough to get cancer is immediately a target for a [legion of quacks](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5891)trying to sell you crazy \"treatments\". There is nothing to stop even the lunatic fringe of alternative medicine, homeopaths, promoting their sugar pills. There are, disgracefully, several hundred homeopaths with medical degrees -all a quack has to do is to ask another quack doctor to endorse their daft ideas. - For untested treatments there is, by definition, no reason to think they'll do more good than harm. The cancer surgeon, Michael Baum said, rightly, that in cases of terminal cancer \"there will be many patients we can't help. but none we can't harm\". As a result of tweeting about the bill, I got a call on 21 October from RT TV (UK) asking me speak on the Saatchi Bill. That was a pleasure. Here it is (done from home, on Skype). And on the day of the Lords debate (24 October 2014) I was asked to talk again about the Saatchi Bill, on the flagship Radio 4 morning news programme, Today. It was only a 3 minute interview with [Mishal Husain](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/1pRyL8J7mJJM4NF7dKrRSJP/mishal-husain), but it was unopposed so I managed to get in the main points. [Click to play](/Today-prog-241014-Saatchi-bill.mp3) interview This is the Today Programme studio. The BBC doesn't pay you, but it's good at driving you to/from the studio, though the cars are unnecessarily posh. On the way home, I had my first ever ride in an all-electric [Tesla](http://www.teslamotors.com/en_GB). It does 0 - 60 in 4.2 seconds but costs \u00a350k -more than twice the price of a Prius. | || | Follow-up 25 October 2014 A summary of the misunderstandings in yesterday's House of Lords debate: [What the Lords Missed](http://www.stopthesaatchibill.co.uk/what-the-lords-missed/). The time when I lose patience with quacks is when they make unjustified claims about serious diseases. Giving false hope to the desperate (often at a high price) is plain wicked. If the patient stops more effective treatment, it's homicide. Homeopaths [have been jailed](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1661) for that. Sometimes it's a result of wishful thinking. Sometimes it's to make money. The latter is morally more despicable. Both are culpable. | | One example was the Totnes (aka Narnia) to \" Another case, the Dove Clinic, was investigated in the Sunday Times, by Jon Ungoed-Thomas and Justin Stoneman: | | There is yet another [cancer conference, Back2Health](http://www.back2healthevents.com/), coming up in April (remember that \"integrative\", in this context, is a euphemism for quackery). The speakers are listed on the left, as they were when I first noticed the conference in December 2012. On the right are the speakers as of February 2013, Spot the difference | | 18 December 2012 | | 28 February 2013 Yes, the one respectable oncologist on the programme, Robert Thomas, has withdrawn from the meeting. I came across Robert Thomas because it was pointed out to me that he spoke at a meeting of [YesToLife](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4239), an organisation that advocates all sorts of treatments that are unsupported by evidence. That seemed like an odd thing for a respectable oncologist to be doing, so I wrote to him, to point out some of the bizarre beliefs of his fellow speakers. Most are familiar names in made-up medicine, but probably not widely known among real oncologists. Professor Thomas seemed unaware of this because he told me \"Thank you for your email and pointing out the vitamin C issues which of course, as you say has no scientific basis and should be outlawed along with many other practices.\" Nevertheless he thought it was too late to pull out of the YesToLife meeting, so went ahead. After this Robert Thomas wrote to me again (18 December 2012) to ask for advice about another conference he'd been invited to speak at, the Back2health event. Again he seemed unaware of the reputations of his fellow speakers, just about all of whom have a track record of advocating treatments for which there is no good evidence. Many of them are purveyors of false hope, often at a high price. I'll deal with only three of them. Dr [Rosy Daniel is there](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Rosy+Daniel%22). She's featured several times on this blog. I met her, with Karol Sikora,here. Her course in quackery was [ditched by the University of Buckingham](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2881) after a year.. Chris Woollams of CancerActive is also there. As readers of this blog will know, I accept he is an honest man and I do feel a great deal of sympathy for him having lost his daughter. This doesn't mean I am any closer to accepting his views on cancer treatment. Next to Thomas's picture is Barbara Wren. She was secretly [ filmed by the BBC](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=384) claiming \"to have cured thyroid cancer by applying external compresses, half an hour with castor oil and half an hour with your own urine\". You can't get much barmier than that. Then there is a nurse, [Patricia Peat](http://www.canceractive.com/cancer-active-page-link.aspx?n=336&Title=Volume%202%20Issue%204%20-%20Nurse%20Patricia), who runs a private \"integrative\" cancer consultancy, [Cancer Options](http://www.canceroptions.co.uk/). She's a prominent supporter of YesToLife which, since at least [February 8th 2013](http://web.archive.org/web/20130208173043/http://www.yestolife.org.uk/y2l/oursupporters.html), has been promoting a video, [\"Cancer is Curable Now](http://canceriscurablenow.tv/)\", which makes totally irresponsible claims (and is illegal in the UK under the Cancer Act, 1939). Among other baseless treatments she has [advocated high dose Vitamin C](http://www.debs-diary.co.uk/?page_id=33). \"The first of these people is the proprietor of Cancer Options. Cancer Options is a private consultancy offering advice to cancer patients. It is run by Patricia Peat who is a qualified nurse. My dad went to see her and she told him the good news, if he followed her advice he could be tumour free in 3 to 4 years. She advised him to have intravenous vitamin C, to have oxygen therapy, heat therapy and to take a myriad of supplements.\" I have heard that the cost of these useless recommendations over a three months would have been \u00a34,640, plus the considerable cost of moving to Brighton, to the Vision of Hope hospital. That includes, for example, a telephone consultation (\u00a3175), supplement pills (\u00a3400) and intravenous vitamin C (\u00a33000). There is no good evidence that any of these would help the patient. Not only would this have destituted his family and taken the patient away from them: it would also have made his last days an unnecessary misery. For Christmas [he would have been condemned](http://www.h2g2.com/entry/A87776464) to a vegan diet, no wheat, sugar or alcohol, and to live on five glasses of raw juice and two jars of sprouts a day (see \" [Would you kick a dying man](http://www.h2g2.com/entry/A87776464)\" for a real life experience). Patricia Peat appears prominently on another web site too, [Self Help Cancer](http://www.self-helpcancer.org/chrisetheridge_patriciapeat.htm). There she's partnered by Dr Chris Etheridge (an ex biochemist, turned herbalist, with no medical qualifications). On that site you'll find every kind of barminess endorsed. It even [takes seriously](http://www.self-helpcancer.org/cancertreatment2c.htm#Burzynski) the notorious Burzynski clinic about which so much has been written, [both here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4836) and [in the USA.](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/burzynski-movie-spawns-a-sequel/) Recommending a bit of foot massage or reiki as a way to relax distraught patients is harmless enough if you like that sort of thing. Recommending you to ignore real doctors is quite another. [ Patricia Peat is on record as saying](http://www.canceractive.com/cancer-active-page-link.aspx?n=704) (my emphasis). \"Also detoxification is as important as what goes in - the rapid removal of toxins from the body would be massively beneficial in reducing the side effects. If someone is on chemotherapy, its very important to get any herbal preparations checked out by a qualified practitioner, to make sure there are no interactions, with the chemotherapy. A lot of nutritional and herbal supplements are very strong, and it is dangerous to suppose that because they are natural, they can do no harm. Probably the worst person to ask about this is your oncologist \" There is, of course, no reason to think that \"detoxification\" is anything other than a figment of the imagination. There is no reason to think that (never-named) toxins are important, and no reason to think that the procedures get rid of anything. If you want sound advice about diet, go to somewhere like the American Cancer Society. There you will find that most of the things that quack nutritionists love to sell you [just don't work](http://www.cancer.org/healthy/eathealthygetactive/acsguidelinesonnutritionphysicalactivityforcancerprevention/acs-guidelines-on-nutrition-and-physical-activity-for-cancer-prevention-common-questions). The ACS asks \" [Will a vitamin a day keep cancer away?\". Their answer is ](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/news/expertvoices/post/2011/08/16/will-a-vitamin-a-day-keep-cancer-away.aspx) \"Can popping vitamin pills prevent cancer? The simple answer is no, based on what we know so far. In fact, some vitamin supplements have even shown harm.\" The journalist, John Diamond, described movingly the way that the alternative industry moved in on him when it became known that he had cancer. His book, Snake Oil and Other Preoccupations was never finished before he died. These extracts from the foreword to the book, by Richard Dawkins, sum it up. \"When the pathologist has read the runes; when the oracles of X-ray, CT scan and biopsy have spoken and hope is guttering low; when the surgeon enters the room accompanied by 'a tallish man ... looking embarrassed ... in hood and gown with a scythe over his shoulder', it is then that the 'alternative' or 'complementary' vultures start circling. This is their moment. This is where they come into their own, for there's money in hope: the more desperate the hope, the richer the pickings. And. to be fair, many pushers of dishonest remedies are motivated by an honest desire to help. Their persistent importunings of the gravely ill, their intrusively urgent offers of pills and potions, have a sincerity that rises above the financial greed of the quacks they promote. \" \"They are targets that deserve to be hit hard, targets whose neutralisation would leave the world a better place: cynical charlatans (or honest foolish dreamers) who prey on gullible unfortunates. And the best part is that although this gallant man is dead, his guns are not silenced\" Shortly before he died, John Diamond said something that I think is one of the most perceptive comments that I've ever read. Some of the blame for the rise of the profitable alternative industry lies with the hype of real medicine. It's worth quoting at length. | | \"But we expected more. Hell, we'd been promised more. Just as we'd learned, rightly, to expect that the political system could be arranged to provide a roof over the head and food in the stomach of all of us, so, we believed, could the medical system be arranged to give us all health and happiness. It was our right, dammit. And the medical establishment, flattered by all those pieces in the popular press describing the latest miracle cure which was just about \u2014always just about \u2014 to arrive at the local surgery, joined in with the celebrations and connived with the scam. Indeed, if the boom in alternative medicine is anybody's fault it's that of orthodox medicine. It was the orthodoxy -helped by the media and our own vanity - which allowed us to believe that we could all be healthy and happy, that there was a pill for every problem and that if we died too early or too painfully it was an act of some agency other than capricious old God. The orthodoxy allowed us to expect And the elsewhere we looked to was the alternative practitioners. They were only too willing to take our custom . . .\" I have no way of knowing whether the people at this conference are \"cynical charlatans\" or \"honest foolish dreamers\". I impute no motives. But I can say that their treatments are very expensive and for the most part they don't work. There is an interesting question about the extent to which charities like YesToLife function as charities, and the extent to which they act as agencies that channel desperate patients into the hands of private hucksters. I don't pretend to know tha answer. I'd like to. | | \"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.\" Follow-up 1 April 2013. The Times contacted me shortly after this came out, about some of the (illegal) nonsense to be found on sale at Amazon. One of their journalists, Kat Lay, did [a good write-up](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/science/medicine/article3727845.ece), and they contacted the MHRA and stirred it into action. [ [download pdf](/Times-Amazon-010413.pdf)]. 5 April 2013. I quoted some of Patricia Peat's views on diet [from a page](http://www.canceractive.com/cancer-active-page-link.aspx?n=704) on Woollams' blog. I notice that the copyright conditions on that page changed \" This content may be copied, in full or in part\", has been changed to \" No content may be reproduced, in whole or in part\". It's curious that there should be an attempt to ban the reproduction of content, of which he authors are presumably proud, and which appears on a public web site. Of course it is also baseless in law, because copyright law has always allowed reproduction of parts of any document for the purposes of fair comment or in the public interest. 20 May 2012 In the USA, the first amendment allows the most outrageous claims to be made. But when they do decide the law has been broken, they do something about it. Their law enforcement is not as pathetically impotent as in the UK. A Dr Christine Donald [treated patients](http://doubtfulnews.com/2013/05/herbal-remedies-do-not-cure-cancer-cancer-quack-to-be-sentenced/) with cancer with an expensive herbal concoction, from her Wellness Clinic in San Fernando Valley. She promised 60 - 80% success rate. she was trusted because she was also a Pentecostal minister. She was convicted of four counts of mail and wire fraud, six counts of tax evasion and one count of witness tampering she was found guilty of in September 2011 She was [sentenced to 14 years](http://blogs.ocweekly.com/navelgazing/2013/05/christine_daniel_tbn_cancer_cu.php) in jail and a fine of $1.2 million. One wonders why that never happens in the UK 26 May 2013 I noticed another [incredible assertion](http://www.debs-diary.co.uk/?page_id=33) by Patricia Peat. \"One could be forgiven for thinking how does anyone manage to die from cancer when the answers to curing it are actually so simplistic and one dimensional.\" So that's solved, then. 10 June 2013. I have just come across a good source of information about all sorts of alternative cancer treatments. \" [CAM-Cancer](http://cam-cancer.org/)\" was originally funded by the European Commission (EC) within the Framework 5 Programme, it is now hosted by the National Information Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NIFAB) at the University of Troms\u00f8, Norway. The offering of quack cancer treatments at an exorbitant price is simple cruelty. The nature of the Burzynski clinic has been known for some time. But it has come to a head with some [utterly vile threatening letters](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/11/the-burzynski-clinic-threatens-my-family.html) sent to the admirable Andrew Lewis, because he [told a few truths](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/11/the-false-hope-of-the-burzynski-clinic.html) about [Stanislaw Burzynski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaw_Burzynski)'s despicable outfit. Please read his original post, [The False Hope of the Burzynski Clinic](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/11/the-false-hope-of-the-burzynski-clinic.html). I have to add by two-pennorth worth to the row that has blown up in the blogosphere at the outrageous behaviour of Burzynski. I hope other bloggers will do the same. There is safety in numbers. We need a Streisand effect to face down these pathetic bullies. It's the \"I am Spartacus\" principle. I won't repeat all the details. They have spread like wildfire round the web. Briefly, it was sparked off by tragic case of a 4-year old girl, Billie Bainbridge who has a rare form of brain cancer. Well-intentioned pop stars have been trying to raise \u00a3200,000 to \"enrol her into a clinical trial\" at Burzynski clinic in Texas, despite the fact that Dr Stanislaw Burzynski has already been [on trial for cancer fraud](http://www.ncahf.org/nl/1997/3-4.html). In fact his clinic is not allowed to treat cancer patients, but it has evaded that ban, for many years, by pretending to run clinical trials. Normally patients volunteer for clinical trials. Sometimes they are paid a modest amount. Never, in the civilised world, are people asked to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds to be a guinea pig. Dorothy Bishop has written about [The Weird World of US ethics regulation](http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2011/11/weird-world-of-us-ethics-regulation.html). There is nothing new about this. The Cancerbusters site won the [Anus Maximus Award ](http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/history/2000/2000awards.htm)for the year 2000. The [award was announced](http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/cancerbusters.htm) in the following words: The top award this year goes to the acolytes of Dr Stanislaw Burzynski who have created an advertising site at www.cancerbusters.com using a five-year-old boy named Thomas Navarro. Thomas is dying of cancer and this site exploits that tragedy to try and get the law changed so that quacks can have the untrammelled right to deceive desperate, sick people by promising them magic cures for cancer, AIDS and other diseases for which no cure is yet available. While this site is specifically a Burzynski promotion, his competitors support the site and mention it because if the campaign is successful it will dramatically increase the size of the market for quackery and therefore their opportunities to make money.

The drug company Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals could not duplicate Burzynski's claims for AS-2.1 and A-10.

Professor Petts has, however, replied to a letters sent to him recently by the [Nightingale Collaboration](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/news/102-pseudo-science-by-degrees-a-response.html). He said \"Whilst I understand your concerns, colleagues of the School of Life Sciences where these courses are offered do not share them. They are not teaching pseudo-science, as you claim,...\". Neither of thse claims is true.I know at least two members of the Life Sciences Faculty who are very worried. One has now left and one has retired. The rest are presumably too scared to speak out. It is most certainly not true to say they \"are not teaching pseudo-science\". Both the vice-chancellor and the Dean of Life Sciences, Jane Lewis, have been made aware of what;s happening repeatedly over several years, I can think of no other way to put it but to say Professor Petts is lying. Tha is not a good thing for vice-chancellors to do. Much of what is taught at Westminster has now been revealed. This seems like a good moment to summarise what we know. Searching this blog for \"University of Westminster\" yields 39 hits. Of these, 11 show what's taught at Westminster, so I'll summarise them here for easy reference. March 26th, 2007 The day after \" [Science degrees without the Science](http://dcscience.net/?p=19)\" appeared in Nature, the University of Westminster issued a statement (now vanished, [but see debate in THE](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=208512\u00a7ioncode=26)). In my view, their statement provides the strongest grounds so far to believe that the BSc is inappropriate. Let's take a look at it. | | \"The BSc (Hons) Health Sciences: Homeopathy is a fully validated degree that satisfies internal and external quality assurance standards.\" Since that time, the university has closed down the BSc in Homeopathy. I have now seen many such validation documents and they are mostly box ticking exercises, not worth the paper they are written on. The worst offender is the [University or Wales](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3675).

But look at what they still teach at Westminster University.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329) March 30th, 2009 In March 2007 I wrote a piece in Nature on [Science degrees without the science](http://dcscience.net/?p=19). At that time there were five \"BSc\" degrees in homeopathy. A couple of weeks ago I checked the UCAS site for start in 2009, and found there was only one full \"BSc (hons)\" left and that was at Westminster University. Today I checked again and NOW THERE ARE NONE. A phone call to the University of Westminster tonight confirmed that they have suspended entry to their BSc (Hons) homeopathy degree. Then I revealed another set of slides, showing a misunderstanding (by the teacher) of statistics, but most chillingly,some very dangerous ideas conveyed to students by Westminster's naturopaths, and in the teaching of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and the great \"detox\" scam. \"if you get tuberculosis, it isn't caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis? And the symptoms are \"constructive\"? So you don't need to do anything. It's all for the best really. This isn't just nonsense. It's dangerous nonsense.\" \"Remember when shopping to favour fruits and vegetables which are in season and locally grown (and ideally organic) as they are more vibrationally compatible with the body.\" Locally grown vegetables are \"more vibrationally compatible with the body\"?

A primer on Emotrance says | | \"And then I thought of the lady in the supermarket whose husband had died, and I spend the following time sending her my best wishes, and my best space time quantum healing efforts for her void.\" Then there are slides on pendulum diagnosis and \"kinesiology\", a well-known fraudulent method of diagnosis.

Much has been written here [about the University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=University+of+Westminster), which remains the biggest provider of junk science degrees in the UK, despite having [closed two of them](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329). If there is one thing more offensive than the use of meaningless mystical language, it is the attempt to hijack the vocabulary of real science to promote nonsense. As soon as a quack uses the words \"quantum\", \"energy\", \"vibration\", or now, \"systems biology\", you can be sure that it's pretentious nonsense. Hot of the press. Within a few hours of posting this, I was told that Volker Scheid, the man behind the pretentious Chinese medidine omics nonsense has been promoted to a full chair, And the Dean, Jane Lewis has congratulated him for speaking at a Chines Medicine symposium.

The vice-chancellor certainly knows about them. So why, I wonder, did he say \"\"Whilst I understand your concerns, colleagues of the School of Life Sciences where these courses are offered do not share them.\". He must know that this simply isn't true. It is over a year now ( 10 July 2009 ) that a lecturer wrote to the vice-chancellor and Dean | | \"I expect that were the Department of Health to be aware of the unscientific teaching and promotion of practices like dowsing, (and crystals, iridology, astrology, and tasting to determine pharmacological qualities of plant extracts) on the Wmin HM [Westminster Herbal Medicine] Course, progress towards the Statutory Regulation of Herbal Medicine could be threatened.\" There's only one thing wrong with this. The lecturer underestimated the stupidiity of the Department of Health which [went ahead with statutory regulation](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4117) despite being made aware of what was going on. The latest example to come to light is cited by Andy Lewis on his [Quackometer blog](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/07/foresight-preconception.html) \"There are some even odder characters too, such as [Roy Riggs B.Sc]who describes himself as a \"Holistic Geobiologist\" and is \"an \"professional Earth Energy dowser\". He guest lectures at the London Westminster University's School of Integrative Medicine and The Baltic Dowser's Association of Lithuania.\" I do wonder who Professor Petts thinks he's fooling. His denial of the obvious fact that his university is teaching pseudo-science serves only to discredit further the University of Westminster and his own integrity. Follow-up 13 August 2011 I'm intrigued to notice that two days after posting this summary, googling \"Geoffrey Petts\" brings up this post as #3 on the first page. Actions have consequences. An email yesterday alerted me to [YesToLife](http://www.yestolife.org.uk/). This outfit seemed to me to be so dangerous that a word of warning is in the public interest. Their own description says \"YES TO LIFE is a new charitable initiative to open up a positive future for people with cancer in the UK by supporting an integrative* approach to cancer care\". That sounds sort of cuddly but lets look below the surface. As so often, the funding seems to have been raised as the result of the death of an unfortunate 23 year old woman. Instead of putting the money into real research, yet another small charity was formed. My correspondent pointed out that \"I came across them at St Pancras Station on Friday afternoon \u2014 they had a live DJ to draw in the crowd and were raising funds through bucket collections\". No doubt many people just see the word 'cancer' and put money in the bucket, without realising that their money will be spent on promoting nonsensical and ineffective treatments. The supporters list. The [list of supporters](http://www.yestolife.org.uk/y2l/oursupporters.html) tells you all you need to know, if you are familiar with the magic medicine business, though it might look quite convincing if you don't know about the people. Sadly the list starts with some celebrities (I didn't know before that Maureen Lipman was an enthusiast foir quackery -how very sad). But never mind the air-head celebrities. The more interesting supporters come later. [Dr Rosy Daniel](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2881)of Health Creation is an old friend. After I complained about her promotion of some herbal concoction called Carctol to \"heal cancer\", she was reprimanded by Trading Standards for breaching the Cancer Act 1939, and forced to change the claims (in my view she should have neen prosecuted but, luckily of her, Trading Standards people are notoriously ineffective). There is, of course not the slightest reason to to think that Carctol works (download [Carctol: Profits before Patients?](http://dcscience.net/ernst-carctrol-2009.pdf)). Read also what Cancer Research UK [say about carctol](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative/therapies/carctol?script=true). Dr Daniel is also well known because ran a course that was, for one year, accredited by the University of Buckingham. But once the university became aware of the nonsense that was being taught on the course, they first removed her as the course director, and then [removed accreditation from the course](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2881)altogether. She then tried to run the course under the aegis of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health, but even they turned her down. Now it is running as a private venture, and is being advertised by YesToLife. - Boo Armstrong, \"Chief Executive of The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health and Founder and Executive Director GetWellUK\". The web site is out of date since the Prince's Foundation [shut its doors](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3023)a year ago. She runs a private company, GetWellUK, that was responsible for a very poor study of alternative medicine in Northern Ireland. So she has a vested interest in promoting it. See [Peter Hain and GetwellUK: pseudoscience and privatisation in Northern Ireland](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=33) - Professor George Lewith. This is beginning to look like the usual list of suspects. I've had cause to write twice about the curious activities of Dr Lewith. See [Lewith's private clinic has curious standards](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=131), in 2006, and this year [George Lewith's private practice. Another case study](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956). The make up your own mind about whether you'd trust him. - Dr Michael Dixon OBE, Chairman NHS Alliance and Medical Director The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. Again the job description is a year out of date. You can read about Dr Dixon at [Prince of Wales Foundation for magic medicine: spin on the meaning of 'integrated'](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466). He seems to be a well meaning man for whom no new-age idea is too barmy. In fact both Dixon and Lewith have moved to a reincarnation of the Prince's Foundation known as the \"College of Medicine\" (actually it's a couple of offices in Buckingham Street). See [Don't be deceived. The new \"College of Medicine\" is a fraud and delusion](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632). It seems to me incomprehensible that people such as Sir Graeme Catto, Sir Cyril Chantler and Sir Muir Grey are willing to be associated with people who behave like this. - Charlotte Grobien, Managing Director, [Give it Away](http://www.give-it-away.co.uk/). This seems to be a fund-raising organisation that has supported YesToLife. The lesson seems to be, never give money to fundraisers unless you know exactly where your money is going. The Help Centre YesToLife has a [help centre](http://www.yestolife.org.uk/y2l/helpcentre.html). But beware, There is no medical person there. Just Traditional Chinese medicine ( [rather dangerous](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923)), acupuncture, osteopath and naturopathy (which means, roughly, do nothing and hope for the best). Patrick Holford, There can be no better indication of the standard of advice to be expected from YesToLife than the fact they are advertising a lecture by Holford, with the enticing title \" [Say no to cancer](http://www.yestolife.org.uk/eents/seminars.html)\".\"Through learning about the effects of diet and nutrition, people with cancer or at risk of developing cancer can be empowered to say Yes to Life and No to Cancer\". Would that it were so easy. It will cost you \u00a315.00. Just in case there is still nobody who has heard of Holford, he is the media nutritionist who has an entire chapter devoted to him in Ben Goldacre's Bad Science book, He has a whole website that has exposed his dubious advice, the excellent [HolfordWatch](http://holfordwatch.info/). And you can find quite a lot about him [on this blog](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Patrick+Holford). Try, for example, [Patrick Holford's CV: the strange case of Dr John Marks](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=44), and [Response to a threatening letter from Mr Holford](#), or [Holford's untruthful and unsubstantiated advertisement](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=163) The treatments directory Now we get to the truly scary bit of YesToLife, their [treatment directory](http://www.yestolife.org.uk/newresourcestart.php). Try searching for 'cancer type' and then \"breast (metastatic)\".. We find no mention of the advances in understanding of the genetics of breast cancer, nor ot real therapies like tamoxifen. What we find are four \"alternative treatments\". [Neuroimmunomodulation Therapy](javascript:mynewwindow(35))It sounds impressive until you learn that its only proponent is a an 82 year old Venezuelan doctor with a clinic in Caracas. Even YesToLife doesn't pretend that there is any evidence that it works [Vitamin C Therapy](javascript:mynewwindow(36))The old chestnut cure-all Vitamin C Again even YesToLife don't pretend there is any good evidence but it is still offered; treatment cost \u00a33140.00 (what?

Although possibly not as barmy as the other things that are recommended, it is nevertheless not shown to be effective for any sort of cancer, [Gerson Therapy](javascript:mynewwindow(14))It is a sign of the extreme unreliability of advice given by YesToLife that they should still recommend anything as totally discredited as Gerson Therapy.Although YesToLife describes it as \"well-researched\" that is simply not true: there are no proper clinical trials. [Cancer Research UK say](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative/therapies/gerson-therapy?script=true) \"Overall, there is no evidence to show that Gerson therapy works as a cure for cancer. \" \"Available scientific evidence does not support claims that Gerson therapy can treat cancer. It is not approved for use in the United States. Gerson therapy can be very harmful to your health.

In some people, particular aspects of the diet such as coffee enemas have been thought to be responsible for their death.\" Recommended reading: [The (Not-So-)Beautiful (Un)Truth about the Gerson protocol and cancer quackery](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=291), by David Gorski (breast cancer surgeon, writing in [Science-based Medicine](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?page_id=791). Conclusion The information supplied by YesToLife is more likely to kill you than to cure you. The next time you see somebody collecting for a \"cancer charity\" be very careful before you give them money. Follow-up November 2012. It gets worse. I had an email from someone who was distressed because a friend was trying to raise \u00a315,000 to cover the cost of treatments recommended by YesToLife. The treatment is high-dose intravenous Vitamin C infusion. This is pure quackery. There isn't the slightest reason to think it will affect the course of cancer, or the wellbeing of the patient. It is exploitation of the desperate. My heart sinks at the thought that a \"charity\" can be quite so wicked. The purpose of this post is to reveal a few samples of things that are taught on a homeopathy 'degree' course. The course in question was the \"BSc Hons homeopathy course at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLAN). Entry to this course was [closed in 2008](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=249) and, after [an internal review](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=252), UCLAN [closed almost all of the rest ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899)of its courses in alternative medicine too. The university is to be commended for this . The purpose of making public some of what used to be taught is not to embarrass UCLAN, which has already done the sensible thing, but to make it clear that the sort of thing taught on such courses is both absurd and dangerous, in the hope of discouraging other courses | | .Three years after I first asked for teaching materials, the On Christmas Eve I got five large box files, 13.7 kg of documents, or 30 pounds, in old money. | | Because these documents are copyright, I rely on the twin defences of fair quotation (only a tiny proportion is being quoted) and public interest. The [Information Tribunal decided ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485)very firmly that it was in the public interest that it should be known what is taught on such courses, and that can be achieved if some of it is made public. Here are a few extracts. Code of ethics The students are given a copy of the [code of ethics of the Society of Homeopaths](http://www.homeopathy-soh.org/about-homeopathy/documents/CodeofEthicsApr04.pdf). This is 25 pages long, but paragraph 48 is especially interesting. 48 Advertisements, stationery and name plates maintain a high standard of propriety and integrity to enhance the reputation of homeopathy. - Advertising shall not contain claims of superiority. - No advertising may be used which expressly or implicitly claims to cure named diseases. - Advertising shall not be false, fraudulent, misleading, deceptive, extravagant or sensational. No mention though, of the fact that this code of ethics has been repeatedly breached by the Society of Homeopaths itself, on its own website. See, for example, [ here in 2007](http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2007/10/14/society-of-homeopaths-breach-own-code-of-ethics-on-website/) and [again in 2009](http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2009/11/13/society-of-homeopaths-breach-code-of-ethics-on-website-still/). as well as [Ernst's article](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/122672978/PDFSTART) on this topic. Anyone who has followed dialogues among homeopaths knows that \"claims to cure named diseases\" is the norm not the exception. The code of ethics is just a bad joke. And the (late) course at UCLAN was no exception. Take, for example, course HP3002, Therapeutic Homeopathy, module leader Jean Duckworth. Homeopathic treatment of cancer There was a lecture on HP3002 called \"A Homeopathic Approach to Cancer (Ramakrishnan methodology [sic])\".. Here are 10 slides from that lecture. It is illegal to claim to be able to cure cancer under the Cancer Act 1939. If a homeopath were to make claims like these in public they'd be open to prosecution, not to mention in breach of the SoH's code of ethics. If cancer is not a \"named disease\", what is? Specific treatments for a named disease are recommended. What happened to treating the whole person? Now specific organs are being treated. The term \"affinity\", as used here, is of course sheer hocus pocus. It is easy to forget when reading this that none of the \"medicines\" contain any medicine whatsoeever. Notice that the term \"remedy\" is used throughout. Any reasonable person would interpret \"remedy\" to imply \"cure\", though no doubt a homeopath, if challenged, would claim that \"remedy\" carried no such implication. The last slide is typical of junk medicine: the personal testimonial, supplied with no detail whatsoever. Just an anecdote which is useless as evidence. This lecture alone strikes me as a cruel (and possibly illegal) hoax perpetrated on desperate patients. Of course a true believer might get some solace from taking the sugar pills, but that is not sufficient justification. The same course dealt with quite a lot of other \"named diseases\", autism, ADHD and coping with a heart attack. And, you are asked, did you think arnica is just a first aid remedy? If that isn't a list of \"named diseases\", what is? The code of ethics appears to be a total sham. And of course never forget that the \"arnica\" doesn't contain any arnica anyway. And if you don't believe that you can read the words of [Kate Chatfield](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=chatfield), module leader on thie very course, as recorded in the [ minutes of evidence](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldselect/ldsctech/166/7022105.htm) to the Select Committee on Science and Technology . Q538 Lord Broers: I have a simple, technical question about homeopathy and drugs. Is it possible to distinguish between homeopathic drugs after they have been diluted? Is there any means of distinguishing one from the other? Ms Chatfield: Only by the label. You can read a lovely analysis of the views of Kate Chatfield by physicist A.P. Gaylard [here](http://apgaylard.wordpress.com/2007/11/08/its-evidence-jim-but-not-as-we-know-it/). Follow-up The Daily Telegraph. January 8th 2009 Ian Douglas reported on this post: [The workings of a BSc in homeopathy](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/iandouglas/100004514/the-workings-of-a-bsc-in-homeopathy/) The Lancashire Evening Post carried a big spread on January 15th, [Professor seeks out the truth about 'quackery'](http://www.lep.co.uk/news/Professor-seeks-out-the-truth.5986186.jp). River's Edge. News and thoughts from Preston, Lancashire reviewed the Lancashire Evening Post article on Saturday January 16th: [Homeopathy at UCLAN, a degree in quackery](http://riversstream.blogspot.com/2010/01/homeopathy-at-uclan-degree-in-quackery.html). The cost of trying to stop this material being revealed. UCLAN told me on 5 February 2010 that the legal costs alone were \u00a380,307.94 (inc. VAT). That doesn't include staff time and photocopying. I'm not convinced that this was a good way to spend taxpayers' money. This post has been [translated into Belorussian](http://onlinepharmacycheck.com/~doc/cnmed-be).. Chinese medicine and herbal medicine are i [n the news at the moment](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007). There is a real risk that the government could endorse them by accepting [ the Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235). In my view traditional Chinese medicine endangers people. The proposed 'regulation' would do nothing to protect the public. Quite on the contrary, it would add to the dangers, by giving an official stamp of approval while doing nothing for safety. The government's idea of improving safety is to make sure that practitioners are 'properly trained'. But it is the qualifications that cause the danger in the first place. The courses teach ideas that are plain wrong and often really dangerous. Why have government (and some universities) not noticed this? That's easy to see. Governments, quangos and university validation committees simply don't look. They tick boxes but never ask what actually goes on. Here's some examples of what goes on for them to think about. They show clearly the sort of dangerous rubbish that is taught on some of these 'degrees'. These particular slides are from the University of Westminster, but similar courses exist in only too many other places. Watch this space for more details on courses at Edinburgh Napier University, Middlesex University and the University of East London Just a lot of old myths. Sheer gobbledygook, SO much for a couple of centuries of physiology, It gets worse. Plain wrong. Curious indeed. The fantasy gobbledygook gets worse. Now it is getting utterly silly. Teaching students that the brain is made of marrow is not just absurd, but desperately dangerous for anyone unlucky (or stupid) enough to go to such a person when they are ill. Here's another herbal lecture., and this time the topic is serious. Cancer. Herbal approaches for patients with cancer. I've removed the name of the teacher to spare her the acute embarrassment of having these dangerous fantasies revealed. The fact that she probably believes them is not a sufficient excuse for endangering the public. There is certainly no excuse for the university allowing this stuff to be taught as part of a BSc (Hons). First get them scared with some bad statistics. No fuss there about distinguishing incidence, age-standardisation and death rates. And no reference. Perhaps a reference to the simple explanation of [statistics at Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=153) might help? Perhaps this slide would have been better ( [from CDC](#)). Seems there is some mistake in slide 2. Straight on to a truly disgraceful statement in slide 3 The is outrageous and very possibly illegal under the Cancer Act (1939). It certainly poses a huge danger to patients. It is a direct incentive to make illegal, and untrue claims by using weasel words in an attempt to stay just on the right side of the law. But that, of course, is standard practice in alternative medicine, Slide 11 is mostly meaningless. \"Strengthen vitality\" sounds good but means nothing. And \"enhancing the immune system\" is what alternative medicine folks always say when they can think of nothing else. Its meaning is ill-defined and there is no reason to think that any herbs do it. The idea of a 'tonic' was actually quite common in real medicine in the 1950s. The term slowly vanished as it was realised that it was a figment of the imagination. In the fantasy world of alternative medicine, it lives on. Detoxification, a marketing term not a medical one, has been extensively debunked quite recently. The use of the word by The [Prince of Wales' company](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=920), Duchy Originals recently [fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/05/there-goes-my-knighthood.html), and his herbal 'remedies' were [ zapped by the MHRA (](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8035072.stm)Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority). And of course the [ antioxidant myth](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=90) is a long-disproved hypothesis that has become a mere marketing term. \"Inhibits the recurrence of cancer\"! That sounds terrific. But if it is so good why is it not even mentioned in the two main resources for information about herbs? In the UK we have the National Library for Health Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialist Library (NeLCAM), now a [part of NHS Evidence. It ](http://www.library.nhs.uk/cam/) was [launched in 2006](http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/News/2006/May/NeLCAM+launch+-+NHS+Complementary+Medicine+website+goes+live.htm). The clinical lead was none other than [Peter Fisher](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Peter+Fisher%22), clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, and the Queen's homeopathic physician. The library was developed with the School of Integrated Health at the [University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22University+of+Westminster%22) (where this particular slide was shown to undergraduates). Nobody could accuse these people of being hostile to magic medicine, It seems odd, then, that NeLCAM does not seem to thnk to think that Centella asiatica, is even worth mentioning. In the USA we have the National Center for Alternative and Complementary Medicine (NCCAM), an organisation that is so friendly to alternative medicine that it has spent a billion dollars on research in the area, though it has produced not a single good treatment for that vast expenditure. But NCCAM too does not even mention Centella asiatica in [its herb list](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm). It does get a mention in [Cochrane reviews](http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&restrict=cochrane_org&scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&client=my_collection&scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&lr=&output=xml_no_dtd&sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&filter=0&site=my_collection&ie=&oe=&scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&scso_newsletters=newsletters&scso_cochrane_org=this_site&proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&btnG=Search) but only as a cosmetic cream and as an unproven treatment for poor venous circulation in the legs. What on earth is a \"lymph remedy\". Just another marketing term? \"especially valuable in the treatment of breast, throat and uterus cancer.\" That is a very dramatic claim. It as as though the hapless students were being tutored in doublespeak. What is meant by \"especially valuable in the treatment of\"? Clearly a desperate patient would interpret those words as meaning that there was at least a chance of a cure. That would be a wicked deception because there isn't the slightest reason to think it works. Once again there this wondrous cure is not even mentioned in either NELCAM or NCCAM. Phytolacca is mentioned, as Pokeweed, in Wikipedia but no claims are mentioned even there. And it isn't mentioned in Cochrane reviews either. The dramatic claims are utterly unfounded. Ah the mistletoe story, again. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) lists [ three completed assessments](http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&restrict=cochrane_org&scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&client=my_collection&scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&lr=&output=xml_no_dtd&sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&filter=0&site=my_collection&ie=&oe=&scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&scso_newsletters=newsletters&scso_cochrane_org=this_site&proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&btnG=Search). One concludes that more research is needed. Another concludes that \"Rigorous trials of mistletoe extracts fail to demonstrate efficacy of this therapy\", and the third says \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak\". NCCAM [says of mistletoe](http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/pdq/cam/mistletoe) - More than 30 human studies using mistletoe to treat cancer have been done since the early 1960s, but major weaknesses in many of these have raised doubts about their findings (see [Question 6](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/21.cdr#Section_21)). - Very few bad side effects have been reported from the use of mistletoe extract, though mistletoe plants and berries are poisonous to humans (see [Question 7](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/25.cdr#Section_25)). - The [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=Patient&language=English)(FDA) has not approved mistletoe as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition (see [Question 8](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28)). - The FDA does not allow injectable mistletoe to be imported, sold, or used except for [clinical](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=Patient&language=English)research (see [Question 8](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28)). Cochrane reviews lists conclusions. [For example](http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003297.html) \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak\". Anthroposophy is one of the highest grades of fantasy you can find. A post on that topic is in the works. \"Indicated for cancers . . . colon/rectal, uterine, breast, lung\". A cure for lung cancer? That, of course, depends on how you interpret the weasel words \"indicated for\". Even [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuja_occidentalis) makes no mention of any claims that Thuja benefits cancer. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) doesn't mention Thuja for any indication. Neither does NCCAM. Nor Cochrane reviews. That is not the impression the hapless students of this BSc lecture were given. In my view suggestions that you can cure lung cancer with this tree are just plain wicked. Pure snake oil, and not even spelled correctly, Harry Hoxsey's treatment centres in the USA were closed by court order in the 1950s. At least this time it is stated that there is no hard evidence to support this brand of snake oil. More unfounded claims when it says \"treated successfully many cancer patients\". No references and no data to support the claim. It is utterly unfounded and claims to the contrary endanger the public. Gerson therapy is one of the most notorious and unpleasant of the quack cancer treatments. The Gerson Institute is on San Diego, but their clinics are in Mexico and Hungary. It is illegal in the USA. According to the [American Cancer Society](http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3x_Gerson_therapy.asp) you get \"a strict low-salt, low-fat, vegetarian diet and drinking juice from about twenty pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables each day. One glass of juice is consumed each hour, thirteen times a day. In addition, patients are given several coffee enemas each day. Various supplements, such as potassium, vitamin B12, pancreatic enzymes, thyroid hormone, and liver extracts, are used to stimulate organ function, particularly of the liver and thyroid.\". At one time you also got several glasses of raw calf liver every day but after infections killed several people []](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Gerson#cite_note-mmwr-6) carrot juice was given instead. [Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=21853) says \"there is no evidence to show that Gerson therapy works as a cure for cancer\", and \"The Gerson diet can cause some very serious side effects.\" Nobody (except perhaps the Price of Wales) has any belief in this unpleasant, toxic and expensive folk-lore. Again patients are endangered by teaching this sort of stuff. And finally, the usual swipe at vaccines. It's nothing to do with herbalism. but just about every alternative medicine advocate seems to subscribe to the anti-vaccination lobby.. It is almost as though they have an active preference for things that are known to be wrong. They seem to believe that medicine and science are part of an enormous conspiracy to kill everyone. Perhaps this dangerous propaganda might have been ameliorated if the students had been shown this slide ( [from a talk by Melinda Wharton](http://www.cga.ct.gov/coc/PDFs/immunization/wharton_ppt.pdf)). Left to people like this, we would still have smallpox, diphtheria. tetanus and rabies, Take a look at [Vaccine-preventable diseases](http://wolfsden.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/vaccine-preventable-diseases/). This is the sort of 'education' which the Pittilo report wants to make compulsory. [Smallpox in Baltimore,](http://www.williams.edu/resources/chapin/exhibits/disturbing1.html) USA, 1939. This man was not vaccinated. Conclusion This selection of slides shows that much of the stuff taught in degrees in herbal medicine poses a real danger to public safety and to public health. Pittilo's idea that imposing this sort of miseducation will help safety is obviously and dangerously wrong. The Department of Health must reject the Pittilo recommendations on those grounds. Follow-up The much-delayed public [consultation on the Pittilo report](http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Liveconsultations/DH_103567) has just opened. It is very important that as many people as possible respond to it. It's easy to say that the consultation is sham.

It is now over a year since the Report to Ministers from \"The Department of Health Steering Group on the Statutory Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Other Traditional Medicine Systems Practised in the UK\" [ [download the report](http://dcscience.net/acupunc-steering-group-2008.pdf)]. The chair of the steering group was Professor R. Michael Pittilo, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen. The reason thet the report is so disastrously bad in its assessment of evidence is that it was written entirely by people with vested interests. The committee consisted of five acupuncturists, five herbalists and five representatives of traditional Chinese medicine (plus eleven observers). There was not a single scientist or statistician to help in the assessment of evidence. And it shows: The assessment of the evidence in the report was execrable. Every one of the committee members would have found themselves out of work if they had come to any conclusion other than that their treatment works, Disgracefully, these interests were not declared in the report, though they are not hard to find. The university of which the chair is vice-chancellor runs a [course in homeopathy](http://www.rgu.ac.uk/nursing/courses/page.cfm?pge=34374), the most discredited of the popular forms of alternative medicine. That tells you all you need to know about the critical faculties of Michael Pittilo. The two main recommendations of this Pittilo report are that - Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine should be subject to statutory regulation by the Health Professions Council - Entry to the register normally be through a Bachelor degree with Honours Let's consider the virtue of these two recommendations. Regulation by the Health Professions Council (HPC) breaks their own rules For a start, this should be ruled out by the HPC's own rules, which require \" [Practise based on evidence of efficacy](http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/newprofessions/criteria/)\" as a condition for registration. Since there is practically no \"evidence of efficacy\", it follows that the HPC can't regulate acupuncture, herbal and Chinese medicine as Pittilo recommends. Or so you'd think. But the official mind seems to have an infinite capacity for doublespeak. The HPC published a report on 11 September 2008, [Regulation of Medical Herbalists, Acupuncturists and Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners](http://www.hpc-uk.org/assets/documents/100023FEcouncil_20080911_enclosure07.pdf). The report says 1. Medical herbalists, acupuncturists and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners should be statutorily regulated in the public interest and for public safety reasons. 2. The Health Professions Council is appropriate as the regulator for these professions. 3. The accepted evidence of efficacy overall for these professions is limited, but regulation should proceed because it is in the public interest. In other words, the [HPC simply decided to ignore its own rules](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1284), Its excuse for doing so is that regulation would protect \"public safety\" . But it simply would not do that. It is ell known that some Chinese herbs are adulterated with dangerous substances, but laws against that already exist. Trading Standards are much more likely to take appropriate action than the HPC. The Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) already deals with the licensing of herbal medicines. and, despite the fact that it recently betrayed its trust by allowing them to be labelled in a misleading way, they are the people to do it, not the HPC. The [Pittilo report](http://dcscience.net/acupunc-steering-group-2008.pdf) (page 11) says In future, it is hoped that more Government funding can be allocated to research into traditional/herbal medicines and acupuncture and that grants will become available to encourage practitioners to undertake postgraduate research work. So they are asking for more government money. In March 2007, the Chinese Government pledged to spend over $130 million over the next five years on research into the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine. It is to be hoped that this money will be targeted effectively to evaluate TCM. It seems to have escaped the notice of Pittilo that roughly 100 percent of trials of Chinese medicine done in China come out positive. Elsewhere, very few come out positive,(see Vickers et al., 1998, Controlled Clinical Trials, 19, 159-166: [download reprint](/Vickers_1998_Controlled-Clinical-Trials.pdf)) The Department of Health would be unwise to rely on Chinese research. Remember that modern acupuncture was not so much a product of ancient wisdom, but rather it stems from nationalist propaganda by Mao Tse-Tung, who needed a cheap way to keep the peasants quiet, though he was too sensible to use it himself. The [HPC report](http://www.hpc-uk.org/assets/documents/100023FEcouncil_20080911_enclosure07.pdf) (page 5) cites these with the words \" . . . a lack of evidence of efficacy should not prevent regulation but that the professions should be encouraged and funded to strengthen the evidence base.\" This sentence seems to assume that the outcomes of research will be to strengthen the evidence base. Thus far, precisely the opposite has been the case. The Pittilo group has apparently not noticed that the US National Institutes of Health has already spent a billion dollars on research in alternative medicine and failed to come up with a single effective treatment. There are better ways to spend money on health. See, for example [$2.5B Spent, No Alternative Med Cures found. ](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=7804031).An enornous amount of research has already been done and the outcomes have produced no good treatments, The proposed regulation would endanger the public, not protect it. The excuse given by the HPC for breaking its own rules is that it should do so to protect the public. Likewise [Ann Keen, Health Minister, said](http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/News/Recentstories/DH_103585): \"Patient safety is paramount, whether people are accessing orthodox health service treatments or using alternative treatments\" So first we need to identify what dangers are posed by acupuncture, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. - Acupuncture is fairly safe. Its biggest danger lies in the unjustified claims that are routinely made for what can be achieved by being impaled by needles. This poses a danger that people may use acupuncture in place of treatments that work - Herbal medicines are unstandardised, so even the very few that may work are dangerous to patients because the dose of active principle is unknown and varies from one batch to another. Taking a herbal medicine is a bit like swallowing a random number of tablets, False health claims pose a danger to patients too, when they cause patients to avoid treatments that work. - Traditional Chinese Medicine is probably the most dangerous. Like the other two, the medicines are unstandardised so the dose is never known. False health claims abound. And in addition to these dangers, many cases have been found of Chinese medicines being adulterated with poisonous substances or with conventional drugs. The form of regulation proposed by Pittilo would do little or nothing to protect the public from any of these dangers. The proposals accept the herbal and Chinese medicine as traditionally practised. Nothing would be done about one of the major dangers, [ the lack of standardisation](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=205). That is a problem that was solved by pharmacologists in the 1930s, when international standards were set for the biological activity of things like tincture of digitalis, and assays were devised so that different batches could be adjusted to the same potency. Now, 80 years later, it is being proposed by Pittilo that we should return to the standards of safety that existed at the beginning of the last century. That is a threat to public safety., but the proposed regulation would do nothing whatsoever to protect the public from this dangerous practice. On the contrary, it would give official government sanction to it. The other major danger is that patients are deceived by false health claims. This is dangerous (as well as dishonest) because it can cause patients to avoid treatments that work better, The internet abounds with claims that herbs can cure anything from diabetes to cancer. Many are doubtless illegal, but regulators like the HPC have traditionally ignored such claims: they are left to Trading Standards, Advertising Standards and the Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) to deal with. The MHRA already also has responsibility for monitoring side effects. The HPC would not do this. The analogy with chiropractic and the GCC The foolishness of allowing statutory regulation for unproven treatments has recently been illustrated quite dramatically by the case of chiropractic. Chiropractors have had statutory regulation by the General Chiropractic Council, which was established by the Chiropractors Act of 1994. The [ British Chiropractic Association (BCA)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1775) recently decided to sue the science writer, Simon Singh, for defamation when he cast doubt on some of the claims made by chiropractors, in particular their claims to be able to cure colic and asthma in children. That led to close examination of the claims. In fact there is no reason to think that spinal manipulation w [orks for asthma](/ernst-chiro-asthma.pdf), or that it works [for colic](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1775). In fact there is quite good evidence that the claims are false. The result was that about 600 well-justified complaints have been lodged with the GCC (enough to bankrupt the GCC if the complaints are dealt with properly). The point of this story is that the statutory regulator had nothing whatsoever to prevent these false health claims being made. Two of the complaints concern practices run by the chair of the GCC. Worse, the GCC actually endorsed such claims. The statutory regulator saw its duty to defend chiropractic (apart from a handful of cases of sexual misdemeanours), not to protect the patient from false health claims. The respectability conferred by statutory regulation made false health claims easier and endangered the public. It would be a disaster if the same mistake were made again. On 11th December 2008 I got a letter form the HPC which said in our opinion a lack of evidence of efficacy would not impede our ability to set standards or deal with complaints we receive. The vast majority of cases we consider are related to conduct. But perhaps that is because they haven't tried \"regulating\" quacks before. Now that the public is far more conscious about health fraud than it used to be, one can predict confidently that the HPC would be similarly overwhelmed by a deluge of complaints about the unjustified health claims made by acupuncturists, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. There is no shortage of them to complain about. The education problem The Pittilo report recommends that the entry level for registration should be a bachelors degree with honours. At first sight it seems reasonable to ask that practitioners should be 'properly qualified', but when one looks at what is actually taught on these degrees it becomes clear that they endanger, rather than protect, the public, There are two very big problems with this recommendation. Firstly, you can't have a bachelors degree with honours until after you have decided whether or not there is anything useful to teach. If and when any of the subjects under consideration and shown to work to a useful extent, then it would be quite reasonable to establish degrees in them. Even the report does not pretend seriously that that stage has been reached. The proposal to set up degrees in subjects, at least some of which are quite likely to have no more than placebo value, is self-evidently nonsense, The time for degrees, and the time for government endorsement by statutory regulation, is after the therapies have been shown to work, not before. The absurdity of thinking that the public will be protected because a practitioner has a degree in, say, acupuncture, is shown with startling clarity by a [recently revealed examination paper](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1950) in acupuncture' You can [download the entire exam paper](http://www.dcscience.net/SalfordChineseMedicine.pdf). Here are a few highlights from it. So students, in 2009, are being taught the crudest form of vitalism. Teaching of traditional Chinese medicine is just as bad. Here are two slides from a course run by the University of Westminster. The first 'explains' the mysterious and entirly mythical \"Qi\". So \"Qi\" means breath, air, vapour, gas, energy, vitalism. This is meaningless nonsense. The second slide shows the real dangers posed by the way Chinese medicine is taught, The symptoms listed at the top could easily be a clue to serious illness, yat students are taught to treat them with ginger. Degrees like this endanger the public. There are more mind-boggling slides from lectures on [Chinese medicine and cancer](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043): they show that what students are being taught is terrifyingly dangerous to patients. It is entirely unacceptable that students are being taught these ancient myths as though they were true, and being encouraged to treat sick people on their basis. The effect of the Pittilo recommendations would be to force new generations of students to have this sort of thing forced on them. In fact the course for which this exam was set has already closed its doors. That is the right thing to do. Here's another example. The course leader for \"BSc (Hons) Herbal Medicine\" at the [Graeme Tobyn BA](https://www.uclan.ac.uk/health/schools/school_of_nursing/divisions/graeme_tobyn_profile.php). But Tobyn is not only a herbalist but also an astrologer. In an [interview he said](http://www.skyscript.co.uk/tobyn.html) \"At the end I asked her if I could cast her horoscope. She threw up her hands and said, 'I knew this would happen if I came to an alternative practitioner.\" \"I think the ruler of the ascendant was applying to Uranus in the ninth house, which was very pertinent.\" This would be preposterous even in the life style section of a downmarket women's magazine, The Pittilo report wants to make degrees run my people like this compulsory. Luckily the Univerity of Central Lancashire is much more sensible and the [course is being closed.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899) The matter is, in any case, being taken out of the hands of the government by the fact that universities are closing degrees in complementary medicine, including courses in some of those under discussion here, The [University of Salford](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885) and the [University of Central Lancashire](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899) have recently announced the closure of all the degree programmes in complementary and alternative medicine. The largest provider of such degrees, the [University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329) has already shut down two of them, and the rest are being assessed at the moment. It is likely that the rest will be closed in the future. The revelation that Westminster had been teaching its first year students that \" [amethysts emit high yin energy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=227)\" and that students had been taught to [diagnose disease and choose treatments by means of a dowsing pendulum](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812), showed very clearly the sort of utter nonsense that undergraduates were being forced to learn to get a 'bachelors degree with honours'. It stretches credulity to its limits to imagine that the public is protected by degrees like this. Precisely the opposite is true. The universities have recognised this, and shut the degrees. One exception is Professor Pittilo's own university which continues to run a [course in homeopathy](http://www.rgu.ac.uk/nursing/courses/page.cfm?pge=34374), the most discredited of all the popular types alternative medicine. A simpler, more effective and cheaper way to protect the public I must certainly agree with the minister that protection of the public is an important matter. Having established that the Pittllo recommendations are more likely to endanger the public than protect them, it is essential to suggest alternative proposals that would work better. Luckily, that is easy, because mechanisms already exist for dealing with the dangers that were listed above. The matter of adulteration, which is serious in traditional Chinese medicine, is a matter that is already the responsibility of the Office of Trading Standards. The major problem of false claims being made for treatment is also the responsibility of the Office of Trading Standards, which has a statutory duty to enforce the Unfair Trading Consumer Protection Regulations of May 2008. [These laws state, for example, that](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=790) \"One of the 31 commercial practices which are in all circumstances considered unfair is \"falsely claiming that a product is able to cure illnesses, dysfunction or malformations\" The monitoring of false claims, and of [side effects of treatments](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122525561/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0), is also the responsibility of the Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA). Rather than setting up complicated, expensive and ineffective 'regulation' by the HPC, all that need to be done is to ensure that the MHRA and/or Trading Standards have the funds to enforce existing laws. At the moment, they are not being implemented effectively, so I'd recommend that responsibility for enforcing the law against false health claims be transferred entirely to the MHRA, which has much more expertise in such matters than Trading Standards This would be both cheaper and more effective than the present system in which the responsibility is divided between the two organisations in an unclear way. This proposal would protect the public against unsafe and adulterated treatments, and it would protect the public against false and fraudulent claims. That is what matters. It would do so more effectively, more cheaply and more honestly than the Pittilo recommendations. There would be no reduction in patient choice either, There is no proposal to ban acupuncture, herbal medicine or traditional Chinese medicine. All that is necessary is to ensure that they don't endanger the public. Since the root of the problem lies in the fact that the evidence for the effectiveness is very weak. the question of efficacy, and cost-benefit ratio, should be referred to NICE. This was recommended by the House of Lords Report (2000). It is recommended again by the Smallwood report (sponsored by the Prince of Wales Foundation). It is baffling that this has not been done already. It does not seem wise to spend large amounts of money on new research at the moment, in the light of the fact that the US National Institutes of Health has already spent over $1 billion on such research without finding a single useful treatment. The results of all this research has been to show that hardly any alternative treatment are effective. That cannot be ignored. Conclusion Recent events show that the halcyon days for alternative medicine are over. When the Pittilo report first appeared, it was greeted with derision in the media. For example, in The Times [Alice Miles wrote](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/alice_miles/article4159652.ece) \"This week came the publication of the Report to Ministers from the Department of Health Steering Group on the Statutory Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Other Traditional Medicine Systems Practised in the UK. Otherwise known as twaddle.\" In the Independent, [Dominic Lawson wrote](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-so-now-we-will-have-degrees-in-quackery-852858.html) So now we will have degrees in quackery. What, really, is the difference between acupuncture and psychic surgery? People will no doubt continue to use it and that is their right and their responsibility. But if the government were to accept the recommendations of the Pittilo report it would be seen, quite rightly, as being anti-scientific and of posing a danger to the public. Fortunately there is a better, and cheaper, way to protect the public. Follow-up Margaret McCartney's blog [in the Financial Times](http://blogs.ft.com/healthblog/2009/08/05/the-force-and-consultation-on-the-pittilo-report-on-alternative-health-therapies/) puts rhw view of a GP with her usual sense, humour and incisiveness. \"This report would, if implemented, create lots more nonsense exam papers funded by a lot more public money - and would produce practitioners without the absolutely crucial skill of how to assess evidence and reject or use it appropriately\" The Times has covered the story (with some interesting comments) [Consultation on how to regulate complementary and alternative therapies](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/alternative_medicine/article6737965.ece) Times Higher Education [UK-wide consultation on CAM regulation is launched](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=407695&c=2) Excellent response from Andy Lewis.

This post is intended to provide some background information about the speakers at the symposium. But let's start with what seems to me to be the real problem. The duplicitous use of the word \"integrated\" to mean two quite different things. The problem of euphemisms: spin and obfuscation One of the problems of meetings like this is the harm done by use of euphemisms. After looking at the programme, it becomes obvious that there is a rather ingenious bit of PR trickery going on. It confuses (purposely?) the many different definitions of the word \"integrative\" [. One definition of \"Integrative medicine](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/139304.php)\" is this (my emphasis). \" . . . orienting the health care process to engage patients and caregivers in the full range of physical, psychological, social, preventive, and therapeutic factors known to be effective and necessary for the achievement of optimal health.\" That is a thoroughly admirable aim. And that, I imagine, is the sense in which several of the speakers (Marmot, Chantler etc) used the term. Of course the definition is rather too vague to be very helpful in practice, but nobody would dream of objecting to it. But another definition of the same term 'integrative medicine' is as a PR-friendly synonym for 'alternative medicine', and that is clearly the sense in which it is used by the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health (FIH), as is immediately obvious from [ their web site](http://www.fih.org.uk/). The [guide to the main therapies ](http://www.fih.org.uk/information_library/complementary_healthcare_a_guide/guide_to_the_main.html)supports everything from homeopathy to chiropractic to naturopathy, in a totally uncritical way. Integrated service refers explicitly to integration of 'complementary' medicine, and that itself is largely a euphemism for alternative medicine. For example, the [FIH's guide to homeopathy](http://www.fih.org.uk/information_library/complementary_healthcare_a_guide/overview_of_the_main_complementary_therapies/homeopathy.html) says \"What is homeopathy commonly used for? Homeopathy is most often used to treat chronic conditions such as asthma; eczema; arthritis; fatigue disorders like ME; headache and menopausal problems; irritable bowel syndrome; Crohn's disease; allergies; repeated ear, nose, throat and chest infections or urine infections; depression and anxiety.\" But there is not a word about the evidence, and perhaps that isn't surprising because the evidence that it works in any of these conditions is essentially zero. The FIH document Complementary Health Care: A Guide for Patients appears to have vanished from the web after its inaccuracy received a very bad press, e.g. in [the Times](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/alternative_medicine/article3760857.ece), and also [here](http://dcscience.net/?p=228). It is also interesting that the equally widely criticised Smallwood report (also sponsored by the Prince of Wales) seems to have vanished too). The programme for the meeting can be seen here, for [Day 1](http://www.fih2009.co.uk/programme.htm), and [Day 2 ](http://www.fih2009.co.uk/day2.htm) Conference chair Dr Phil Hammond, GP, comedian and health service writer. Hammond asked the FIH if I could speak at the meeting to provide a bit of balance. Guess what? They didn't want balance. 09:30 Opening session Dr Michael Dixon OBE 09:30 Introduction: a new direction for The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health and new opportunities in integrated health and care. Dr Michael Dixon, Medical Director, FIH Michael Dixon is devoted to just about every form of alternative medicine. As well as being medical director of the Prince's Foundation he also runs the NHS Alliance. Despite its name, the NHS Alliance is nothing to do with the NHS and acts, among other things, as an advocate of alternative medicine on the NHS, about which it [has published a lot](http://www.nhsalliance.org/documents.asp?display=docs&themeid=8). Dr Dixon is also a GP at [College Surgery](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/index.asp), Cullompton, Devon, where his \"integrated practice\" includes [dozens of alternative practitioners](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/ComplementaryTherapy_Practitioners.asp). They include not only disproven things like homeopathy and [acupuncture](http://dcscience.net/?p=945), but also even more bizarre practitioners in ' [Thought Field Therapy](http://www.csicop.org/si/2000-07/thought-field-therapy.html)' and ' [Frequencies of Brilliance](http://www.frequenciesofbrilliance.us/index.html)'. To take only one of these, 'Frequencies of Brilliance' is bizarre beyond belief. One need only quote its founder and chief salesperson. \"Frequencies of Brilliance is a unique energy healing technique that involves the activation of energetic doorways on both the front and back of the body.\" \"These doorways are opened through a series of light touches. This activation introduces high-level Frequencies into the emotional and physical bodies. It works within all the cells and with the entire nervous system which activates new areas of the brain.\" \"Frequencies of Brilliance is a 4th /5th dimensional work. The process is that of activating doorways by lightly touching the body or working just above the body.\" \"Each doorway holds the highest aspect of the human being and is complete in itself. This means that there is a perfect potential to be accessed and activated throughout the doorways in the body.\" Best of all, it can all be [done at a distance ](http://www.frequenciesofbrilliance.us/longdistancework.html)(that must help sales a lot). One is reminded of the Skills for Health \"competence\" in distant healing (inserted on a government web site at the behest (you guessed it) of the Prince's Foundation, [as related here](http://dcscience.net/?p=215#sfh)) \"The intent of a long distance Frequencies of Brilliance (FOB) session is to enable a practitioner to facilitate a session in one geographical location while the client is in another. A practitioner of FOB that has successfully completed a Stage 5 Frequency workshop has the ability to create and hold a stable energetic space in order to work with a person that is not physically present in the same room. The space that is consciously created in the Frequencies of Brilliance work is known as the \"Gap\". It is a space of nonlinear time. It contains \"no time and no space\" or respectively \"all time and all space\". Within this \"Gap\" a clear transfer of the energies takes place and is transmitted to an individual at a time and location consciously intended. Since this dimensional space is in non-linear time the work can be performed and sent backward or forward in time as well as to any location. The Frequencies of Brilliance work cuts through the limitations of our physical existence and allows us to experience ourselves in other dimensional spaces. Therefore people living in other geographic locations than a practitioner have an opportunity to receive and experience the work. The awareness of this dimensional space is spoken about in many indigenous traditions, meditation practices, and in the world of quantum physics. It is referred to by other names such as the void, or vacuum space, etc.\" This is, of course, preposterous gobbledygook. It, and other things in Dr Dixon's [treatment guide](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/ComplementaryTherapy_Treatment.asp), seem to be very curious things to impose on patients in the 21st century. Latest news. The [Mid-Devon Star announces](http://www.middevonstar.co.uk/news/4198135.Homeopathy_comes_to_Cullompton/) yet more homeopathy in Dr Dixon's Cullompton practice. This time it comes in the form of a clinic run from the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital. I guess they must be suffering from reduced commissioning like all the other homeopathic hospitals, but Dr Dixon seems to have come to their rescue. The connection seems to be with Bristol's homeopathic consultant, Dr Elizabeth A Thompson. On 11 December 2007 I wrote to Dr Thompson, thus | | In March 2006, a press release This was reported also on the BBC I'd be very grateful if you could let me know when results from this trial will become available. Yours sincerely David Colquhoun The reply, dated 11 December 2007, was unsympathetic | | I have just submitted the funders report today and we have set ourselves the deadline to publish two inter-related papers by March 1st 2007. Can I ask why you are asking and what authority you have to gain this information. I shall expect a reply to my questions, I answered this question politely on the same day but nevertheless my innocent enquiry drew forth a rather vitriolic complaint from Dr Thompson to the Provost of UCL (dated 14 December 2007). In this case, the Provost came up trumps. On 14 January 2008 he replied to Thompson: \"I have looked at the email that you copied to me, and I must say that it seems an entirely proper and reasonable request. It is not clear to me why Professor Colquhoun should require some special authority to make such direct enquiries\". Dr Thompson seems to be very sensitive. We have yet to see the results of her trial in which I'm still interested. Not surprisingly, Dr Dixon has had some severe criticism for his views, not least from the UK's foremost expert on the evidence for efficacy, Prof Edzard Ernst. Accounts of this can be found in [Pulse](http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=35&storycode=4121964&c=2), and on [Andrew Lewis's blog](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/02/graceless-dr-michael-dixon-obe.html). Dixon is now (in)famous in the USA too. The excellent Yale neurologist, Steven Novella, has written an analysis of his views on Science Based Medicine. He describes Dr. Michael Dixon as \" [A Pyromaniac In a Field of (Integrative) Straw Men](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=450)\" Peter Hain 09:40 Politics and people: can integrated health and care take centre stage in 2009/2010? Rt Hon Peter Hain MP It seems that Peter Hain was converted to alternative medicine when his first baby, Sam, was born with eczema. After (though possibly not because of) homeopathic treatment and a change in diet, the eczema got better. This caused Hain, while Northern Ireland Secretary to spend \u00a3200,000 of taxpayers' money to set up a totally uninformative customer satisfaction survey, which is being touted elsewhere in this meeting as though it were evidence (see below). I have written about this episode before: see [Peter Hain and Get Well UK: pseudoscience and privatisation in Northern Ireland](http://dcscience.net/?p=33). I find it very sad that a hero of my youth (for his work in the anti-apartheid movement) should have sunk to promoting junk science, and even sadder that he does so at my expense. There has been a report on Hain's contribution in [Wales Online](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/05/15/make-complementary-medicine-free-on-the-nhs-says-hain-91466-23628473/). 09:55 Why does the Health Service need a new perspective on health and healing? Sir Cyril Chantler, Chair, King's Fund, previous Dean, Guy's Hospital and Great Ormond Street Cyril Chantler is a distinguished medical administrator. He also likes to talk and we have discussed the quackery problem several times. He kindly sent me the slides that he used. Slide 18 says that in order to do some good we \"need to demonstrate that the treatment is clinically effective and cost effective for NHS use\". That's impeccable, but throughout the rest of the slides he talks of integrating with complementary\" therapies, the effectiveness of which is either already disproved or simply not known. I remain utterly baffled by the reluctance of some quite sensible people to grasp the nettle of deciding what works. Chantler fails to grasp the nettle, as does the Department of Health. Until they do so, I don't see how they can be taken seriously. 10.05 Panel discussion The Awards 10:20 Integrated Health Awards 2009 Introduction: a review of the short-listed applications 10:45 Presentations to the Award winners by the special guest speaker 11:00 Keynote address by special guest speaker Getting integrated Dr David Peters 12:00 Integration, long term disease and creating a sustainable NHS. Professor David Peters, Clinical Director and Professor of Integrated Healthcare, University of Westminster I first met David Peters after Nature ran my article, [Science Degrees without the Science. ](http://dcscience.net/?p=19).One of the many media follow-ups of that article was on Material World (BBC Radio 4). This [excellent science programme](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/thematerialworld.shtml), presented by Quentin Cooper, had a discussion between me and David Peters ( [listen to the mp3 file).](http://dcscience.net/material-world-part2-220307.mp3) There was helpful intervention from Michael Marmot who had talked, in the first half of the programme, about his longitudinal population studies. Marmot stressed the need for proper testing. In the case of homeopathy and [acupuncture](http://dcscience.net/?p=945), that proper testing has largely been done. The tests were failed. The University of Westminster has, of course, gained [considerable notoriety](http://dcscience.net/?s=Westminster+university) as the university that runs more degree programmes in anti-scientific forms of medicine than any other. Their lecture on [vibrational medicine](http://dcscience.net/?p=227) teaches students that [amethysts \"emit high Yin energy so transmuting lower energies and clearing and aligning energy disturbances at all levels of being\"](http://dcscience.net/?p=227#slides). So far their vice-chancellor, Professor Geoffrey Petts, has declined to answer enquiries about whether he thinks such gobbledygook is appropriate for a BSc degree. But he did set up an internal enquiry into the future of their alternative activities. Sadly that enquiry seems to have come to the nonsensical conclusion that the problem can be solved by injection of good science into the courses, as [reported here](http://dcscience.net/?p=1191) and in [the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2009/feb/24/homeopathy-science). It seems obvious that if you inject good science into their BSc in homeopathy the subject will simply vanish in a puff of smoke. In 2007, the University of Westminster did respond to earlier criticism in [Times Higher Education](http://dcscience.net/thes-060407.pdf), but [their response](http://dcscience.net/?p=83) seemed to me to serve only to dig themselves deeper into a hole. Nevertheless, Westminster has now closed down its homeopathy degree (the last in the country to go) and there is intense internal discussion going on there. I have the impression that Dr Peters' job is in danger. The [revelation of more slides](http://dcscience.net/?p=1329) from their courses on homeopathy, naturopathy and Chinese herbal medicine shows that these courses are not only barmy, but also sometimes dangerous. Professor Chris Fowler 12:10 Educating tomorrow's integrated doctors. Professor Chris Fowler, Dean for Education, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry I first came across Dr Fowler when I noticed him being praised for his teaching of alternative medicine to students at Barts and the London Medical School on the web site of the Prince's Foundation. I wrote him a polite letter to ask if he really thought that the Prince of Wales was the right person to consult about the education of medical students. The response I got was, ahem, unsympathetic. But a little while later I noticed that two different Barts students had set up public blogs that criticised strongly the nonsense that was being inflicted on them. At that point, I felt it was necessary to support the students who, it seemed to me, knew more about medical education than Professor Fowler. It didn't take long to uncover the nonsense that was being inflicted on the students: [read about it here](http://dcscience.net/?p=555). There is a [follow-up to this story here](http://dcscience.net/?p=1143). Fortunately, Barts' Director of Research, and, I'm told, the Warden of Barts, appear to agree with my view of the harm that this sort of thing can do to the reputation of Barts, so things may change soon, Dame Donna Kinnair 12:30 Educating tomorrow's integrated nurses. Dame Donna Kinnair, Director of Nursing, Southwark PCT As far as I can see, Donna Kinnair has no interest in alternative medicine. She is director of nursing at Southwark primary care trust and was an adviser to Lord Laming throughout his inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbi\u00e9. I suspect that her interest is in integrating child care services (they need it, judging by the recent death of 'Baby P'). Perhaps her presence shows the danger of using euphemisms like 'integrated medicine' when what you really mean is the introduction of unproven or disproved forms of medicine. Michael Dooley 12:40 Integrating the care of women: an example of the new paradigm. Michael Dooley, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynecologist DC's rule 2. Never trust anyone who uses the word 'paradigm'. It is a sure-fire sign of pseudoscience. In this case, the 'new paradigm' seems to be the introduction of disproven treatment. Dooley is a gynaecologist and Medical Director of the [ Poundbury Clinic](http://www.thepoundburyclinic.com/). His clinic offers a [whole range of unproven](http://www.thepoundburyclinic.com/treatments.htm) and disproved treatments. These include acupuncture as an aid to conception in IVF. This is not recommended by the [ Cochrane review](http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab006920.html), and one report suggests that it [hinders conception rather than helps](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/oct/17/medicalresearch). 12.40 Discussion 13.00 - 14.00 Lunch and Exhibition 15.30 Tea Boo Armstrong and Get Well UK 16.00 Integrated services in action: The Northern Ireland experience: what has it shown us and what are its implications? Boo Armstrong of Get Well UK with a team from the NI study I expect that much will be made of this \"study\", which, of course, tells you absolutely nothing whatsoever about the effectiveness of the alternative treatments that were used in it. This does not appear to be the view of Boo Armstrong, On the basis of the \"study\", her [company's web site](http://www.getwelluk.com/) proclaims boldly \"Complementary Medicine Works Get Well UK ran the first government-backed complementary therapy project in the UK, from February 2007 to February 2008 This claim appears, prima facie, to breach the [Unfair Trading Regulations](http://dcscience.net/?p=790) of May 2008. The legality of the claim is, at the moment, being judged by a Trading Standards Officer. In any case, the \"study\" was not backed by the government as a whole, but just by Peter Hain's office. It is not even clear that it had ethical approval. The study consisted merely of asking people who had seen an alternative medicine practitioner whether they felt better or worse. There was no control group; no sort of comparison was made. It is surely obvious to the most naive person that a study like this cannot even tell you if the treatment has a placebo effect, never mind that it has any genuine effects of its own. To claim that it does so seems to be simply dishonest. There is no reason at all to think that the patients would not have got better anyway. It is not only Get Well UK who misrepresent the evidence. The [Prince's Foundation itself ](http://www.fih.org.uk/media_centre/sense_at_last.html)says \"Now a new, year long trial supported by the Northern Ireland health service has . . . demonstrated that integrating complementary and conventional medicine brings measurable benefits to patients' health.\" That is simply not true. It is either dishonest or stupid. Don't ask me which, I have no idea. This study is no more informative than the [infamous Spence (2005) 'study'](http://dcscience.net/?p=198) of the same type, which seems to be the only thing that homeopaths can produce to support their case. There is an excellent analysis of the Northern Ireland 'study' by Andy Lewis, [The Northern Ireland NHS Alternative Medicine 'Trial'](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/02/northern-ireland-nhs-alternative.html). He explains patiently, yet again, what constitutes evidence and why studies like this are useless. His analogy starts \" . . . the Apple Marketing Board approach the NHS and ask for \u00a3200,000 to do a study to show the truth behind the statement 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away'. The Minister, being particularly fond of apples, agrees and the study begins.\" 16.30 Social enterprise and whole systems integrated care. Dee Kyne, Sandwell PCT and a GP.

Peter Mackereth, Clinical Lead, Supportive Services, Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust I had some correspondence with Mackereth when the Times (7 Feb 2007) published a picture of the Prince of Wales inspecting an \"anti-MRSA aromatherapy inhaler\" in his department at the Christie. It turned out that the trial they were doing was not blind No result has been announced anyway, and on enquiry, I find that the trial has not even started yet. Surprising, then to find that the FIH is running the [First Clinical Aromatherapy Conference at the Christie Hospital](http://www.fih.org.uk/events/events_from_other_organisations/1st_clinical.html), What will there be to talk about? Much of what they do at the Christie is straightforward massage, but [they also promote](http://www.christie.nhs.uk/press/2007/070207.aspx) the nonsensical principles of \"reflexology\" and acupuncture. The former is untested. The latter [is disproven](http://dcscience.net/?p=945). Parallel Sessions Developing a PCT funded musculoskeletal service Dr Roy Welford, Glastonbury Health Centre [Roy Welford is a Fellow](http://www.glastonburyhealthcentre.co.uk/comptherapy.html) of the Faculty of Homeopathy, and so promotes disproven therapies. The [Glastonbury practice](http://www.glastonburyhealthcentre.co.uk/comptherapy.html) also advertises acupuncture ( [disproven](http://dcscience.net/?p=945)), osteopathy and herbal medicine (largely untested so most of it consists of giving patients an unknown dose of an ill-defined drug, of unknown effectiveness and unknown safety). Making the best of herbal self-prescription in integrated practice: key remedies and principles. Simon Mills, Project Lead: Integrated Self Care in Family Practice, Culm Valley Integrated Centre for Health, Devon Simon Mills is a herbalist who now [describes himself as a \"phytotherapist\"](http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=6720250368336924437) (it sounds posher, but the evidence, or lack of it, is not changed by the fancy name). Mills likes to say things like \"there are herbs for heating and drying\", \"hot and cold\" remedies, and to use meaningless terms like [\"blood cleanser\"](http://dcscience.net/?p=16), but he appears to be immune to the need for good evidence that herbs work before you give them to sick people. [He says, at the end of a talk, ](http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=6720250368336924437) \"The hot and the cold remain the trade secret of traditional medicine\". And this is the 21st Century. Practical ways in which complementary approaches can improve the treatment of cancer. Professor Jane Plant, Author of \"Your life in your hands\" and Chief Scientist, British Geological Society and Professor Karol Sikora, Medical Director, Cancer Partners UK Jane Plant is a geologist who, through her own unfortunate encounter with breast cancer, became obsessed with the idea that a dairy-free diet cured her. Sadly there is no good evidence for that idea, according to the [World Cancer Research Fund Report](http://dcscience.net/Marmot-Report.pdf), led by Professor Sir Michael Marmot. No doubt her book on the subject sells well, but it could be held that it is irresponsible to hold out false hopes to desperate people. She is a supporter of the very dubious [CancerActive](http://dcscience.net/?p=119) organisation (also supported by Michael Dixon OBE - [see above](#dixon)) as well as the notorious pill salesman, [Patrick Holford](http://holfordwatch.info/) (see also [here](#)). Karol Sikora, formerly an oncologist at the Hammersmith Hospital, is now [Dean of Medicine](http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/medicine/) at the [University of Buckingham](http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/) (the UK's only private university). He is also medical director at [CancerPartners UK](http://www.cancerpartnersuk.org/), a private cancer company. He recently shot to fame when he [appeared in a commercial](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/may/13/advertising-campaign-nhs-us-healthcare-reforms) in the USA sponsored by \"Conservatives for Patients' Rights\", to pour scorn on the NHS, and to act as an advocate for the USA's present health system. A very curious performance. Very curious indeed. His attitude to quackery is a mystery wrapped in an enigma. One was somewhat alarmed to see him sponsoring a course at what was, at first, called the British College of Integrated Medicine, and has now been renamed the [Faculty of Integrated Medicine](http://www.integratedmedicine.org.uk/) That grand title makes it sound like part of a university. It isn't. The alarm was as result of the alliance with Dr Rosy Daniel (who promotes an [untested herbal conconction, Carctol](http://www.healthcreation.co.uk/node/20), for 'healing' cancer) and Dr Mark who has also [promoted the Qlink pendant](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-398105/Good-vibrations.html). The Qlink pendant is a simple [and obvious fraud](http://www.badscience.net/2007/05/the-amazing-qlink-science-pedant/) designed to exploit paranoia about WiFi killing you. The first list of speakers on the proposed diploma in Integrated Medicine was an unholy alliance of outright quacks and commercial interests. It turned out that, although Karol Sikora is sponsoring the course, he knew nothing about the speakers. I did and when I pointed this out to Terence Kealey, vice-chancellor of Buckingham, he immediately removed Rosy Daniel from directing the Diploma. At the moment the course is being revamped entirely by Andrew Miles. There is hope that he'll do a better job. It has not yet been validated by the University of Buckingham. Watch this space for developments. Stop press It is [reported in the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/may/22/karol-sikora-honorary-professor-imperial-college) that Professor Sikora has been describing his previous job at Imperial College with less than perfect accuracy.

This is the group which, by sheer wealth, has persuaded so many otherwise respectable US universities to embrace every sort of quackery (see, for example, [Integrative baloney @ Yale](http://dcscience.net/?p=231)) The funding of integrated services 14.15 How to get a PCT or practice- based commissioner to fund your integrated service.

One hopes they will be more interested in evidence than the supplicants. Mike Cummings at least doesn't believe the nonsense about meridians and Qi. It's a pity he doesn't look at the real evidence though. You can read something about him and his journal at [BMJ Group promotes acupuncture: pure greed](http://dcscience.net/?p=351). Osteopathy sounds a bit more respectable than the others, but in fact it has never shaken off its [cult-like origins.](http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/QA/osteo.html) Still many osteopaths make absurd claims to cure all sorts of diseases. Offshoots of osteopathy like 'cranial osteopathy' are obvious nonsense. There is no reason to think that osteopathy is any better than any other manipulative therapy and it is clear that all manipulative therapies should be grouped into one. Osteopathy and chiropractic provide the best ever examples of the folly of giving official government recognition to a branch of alternative medicine before the evidence is in. Learned Lion Partners is a new one on me. It seems it is part of [Madsen Gornall Ashe Chambers ('MGA Chambers')](http://www.mgagroup.co.uk/AMWL/LL_fset.htm) \"a grouping of top level, independent specialists who provide a broad range of management consultancy advice to the marketing community\". It's a management consultant and marketing outfit. So don't expect too much when it comes to truth and evidence. The company web site says nothing about alternative medicine, but only that [Nigel Clarke](http://www.mgagroup.co.uk/fsetpeople.htm) \". . . has very wide experience of public affairs issues and campaigns, having worked with clients in many sectors in Europe, North America and the Far East. He has particular expertise in financial, competition and healthcare issues. \" However, all is revealed when we see that he is a [Trustee of the Prince's Foundation](http://www.fih.org.uk/about_us/our_trustees.html) where his entry says \"Nigel Clarke is senior partner of Learned Lion Partners. He is a director of Vidapulse Ltd, Really Easy Ltd, Newscounter Ltd and Advanced Transport Systems Ltd. He has worked on the interfaces of public policy for 25 years. He has been chair of the General Osteopathic Council since May 2001, having been a lay member since it was formed. He is now a member of the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence\" The [Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence](http://www.chre.org.uk/) is yet another quango that ticks boxes and fails absolutely to grasp the one important point, does it work?. I came across them [at the Westminster Forum](http://dcscience.net/?p=15#chre), and they seemed a pretty pathetic way to spend \u00a32m per year. Peter Fisher is the last supplicant to the Dragons. He is clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital (RLHH), and Queen's homeopathic physician, It was through him that I got an active interest in quackery. The TV programme QED asked me to check the statistics in a paper of his that claimed that [homeopathy was good for fibrositis](http://dcscience.net/?p=201) (there was an elementary mistake and no evidence for an effect). Peter Fisher is also remarkable because he agreed with me that BSc degrees in homeopathy were not justified (on TV - [see the movie](http://dcscience.net/?p=19)). And [he condemned homeopaths](http://dcscience.net/?p=207) who were caught out recommending their sugar pills for malaria. To that extent Fisher represents the saner end of the homeopathic spectrum. Nevertheless he still maintains that sugar pills work and have effects of their own, and tries to [justify the 'memory of water'](http://dcscience.net/?p=282#hom) by making analogies with a memory stick or CD. This is so obviously silly that no more comment is needed. Given Fisher's sensible condemnation of the malaria fiasco, I was rather surprised to see that he appeared on the [programme of a conference](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/CAM/docs/CAMSTRAND%20programme%20Apr%2009%20final.pdf) at the University of Middlesex, talking about \"A Strategy To Research The Potential Of Homeopathy In Pandemic Flu\". The title of the conference was Developing Research Strategies in CAM. A colleague, after seeing the programme, thought it was more like \"a right tossers' ball\". Much of the homeopathy has now vanished from the RLHH as a result of greatly reduced commissioning by PCTs ( [read about it](http://www.zeusinfoservice.com/Health/Hospitalneedsyoursupport.html) in Fisher's own words). And the [last homeopathy degree in the UK has closed down](http://dcscience.net/?p=1329). It seems an odd moment for the FIH to be pushing it so hard. Follow-up Stop press It is [reported in the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/may/22/karol-sikora-honorary-professor-imperial-college) (22 May 2009) that [Professor Sikora](#sikora) has been describing his previous job at Imperial College with less than perfect accuracy. Oh dear, oh dear. This fascinating fact seems to have been unearthed first by the admirable NHS Blog Doctor, in his post ' [Imperial College confirm that Karol Sikora does not work for them and does not speak on their behalf](http://nhsblogdoc.blogspot.com/2009/05/imperial-college-confirms-that-karol.html)'. Recently I wrote a piece for the [National Health Executive](http://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/) (\"the Independent Journal for Senior Health Service Managers\"), with the title [Medicines that contain no medicine and other follies](http://dcscience.net/?p=675) In the interests of what journalists call balance (but might better be called equal time for the Flat Earth Society), an article appeared straight after mine, [Integrating Homeopathy into Primary Care](http://dcscience.net/rachel-roberts-soh+refs--nhe-nov-dec-2008.pdf). It was by Rachel Roberts \"Research consultant for the Society of Homeopaths\". This defence was so appalling that I sent them a response (after first doing a bit of checking on its author). To my surprise, they published the response in full [ [download pdf of printed version](/colquhoun-placebo-fraud-NHE-Feb-2009.pdf)]. Their title was As always, the first step is to Google the author, to find out a bit more. It seems that Rachel Roberts runs a business [Integrated Homeopathic Training](http://www.ihtraining.org/). (a financial interest that was not mentioned in her article). She will sell you flash cards ('Matmedcards') for \u00a370 (+\u00a39 p&p) for 120 cards (yes, seriously). The card for Conium maculatum is remarkable. It says on the reverse side Yes, it says (my emphasis) \"The poison used to execute Socrates. No 1 remedy for scirrhous breast cancer. Esp after blow to the breast\" No doubt she would claim that the word \"remedy\" was a special weasel word of homeopaths that did not imply any therapeutic efficacy. But its use in this context seems to me to be cruel deception, even murderous. It also appears to breach the Cancer Act 1939, as well as the [Unfair Trading laws](http://dcscience.net/?p=790). I asked the Bristol Trading Standards Office, and got a reply remarkably quickly. It ended thus. \". . . . the use of the card for \"hemlock\" as an example amounts to advice in connection with the treatment (of cancer)\". I will initially write to IHT and require that they remove this, and any other, reference to cancer treatment from their website. When I checked again a couple of weeks later, the hemlock sample card had been been replaced by one about chamomile (it is described as the opium of homeopathy. Luckily the pills contain no opium (and no chamomile either) or that would be breaking another law. Bafflingly, it is not (yet) against the law to sell pills that contain no trace of the ingredient on the label, if they are labelled 'homeopathic'. Presumably the packs still contain a claim to cure cancer. And what is said in the privacy of the consulting room will never be known. Political correctness is a curious thing. I felt slightly guilty when I reported this breach of the Cancer Act. It felt almost sneaky. The feeling didn't last long though. We are talking about sick people here. It isn't hard to imagine a desperate woman suffering from cancer reading that Ms Roberts knows the \"No 1 remedy for scirrhous breast cancer\". She might actually believe it. She might buy some hemlock pills that contain no hemlock (or anything else). She might die as a result. It is not a joke. It is, literally, deadly serious. It is also deadly serious that the Department of Health and some NHS managers are so stifled by political correctness that they refer to homeopaths as \"professionals\" and pay them money. |Ms Roberts, in her article, is at pains to point out that | Well it is already well known that the [the Code of Ethics](http://www.homeopathy-soh.org/about-the-society/documents/CodeofEthicsApr04.pdf) of the Society of Homeopaths is [something of a joke](http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2007/10/14/society-of-homeopaths-breach-own-code-of-ethics-on-website/). This is just one more example. The Code of Ethics, para 72 says homeopaths have a legal obligation \"To avoid making claims (whether explicit or implied; orally or in writing) implying cure of any named disease.\" Like, perhaps, claiming to have the \"No 1 remedy for scirrhous breast cancer\"? Obviously [voluntary self-regulation](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2008/10/society-of-homeopaths-failure-of-self.html) isn't worth the paper it's written on. You don't need to go to her web site to find \"claims . . . implying cure of any named disease\". In [her article](http://dcscience.net/rachel-roberts-soh+refs--nhe-nov-dec-2008.pdf) she says \"Conditions which responded well to homeopathy included childhood eczema and asthma, migraine, menopausal problems, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, arthritis, depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.\" No doubt they will say that the claim that asthma and migraine \"responded well\" to their sugar pills carries no suggestion that they can cure a named disease. And if you believe that, you'll believe anything. I have to say that I find Ms Robert's article exceedingly puzzling. It comes with 29 references, so it looks, to use Goldacre's word, 'sciencey'. If you read the references, and more importantly, know about all the work that isn't referred to, you see it is the very opposite of science. I see only two options. Either it is deliberate deception designed to make money, or it shows, to a mind-boggling extent, an inability to understand what constitutes evidence. The latter, more charitable, view is supported by the fact that Ms Roberts trots out, yet again, the [infamous 2005 Spence paper](http://dcscience.net/?p=198), as though it constituted evidence for anything at all. In this paper 6544 patients at the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital were asked if the felt better after attending the out-patient department. Half of them reported that the felt 'better' or 'much better'. Another 20% said they were 'slightly better' (but that is what you say to be nice to the doctor). The patients were not compared with any other group at all. What could be less surprising than that half of the relatively minor complaints that get referred for homeopathy get 'better or much better' on their own? This sort of study can't even tell you if homeopathic treatment has a placebo effect, never mind that it has a real effect of its own. It is a sign of the desperation of homeopaths that they keep citing this work. Whatever the reason, the conclusion is clear. Never seek advice from someone who has a financial interest in the outcome. Ms Roberts makes her living from homeopathy. If she were to come to the same conclusion as the rest of the world, that it is a placebo and a fraud, her income would vanish. It is asking too much of anyone to do that. |This is the mistake made time and time again by the Department of Health and by the NHS. The | At present , the regulation of alternative medicine is chaotic because the government and the dozen or so different quangos involved are trying to regulate while avoiding the single most important question - do the treatments work? They should now grasp that nettle and refer the question to NICE. "}
