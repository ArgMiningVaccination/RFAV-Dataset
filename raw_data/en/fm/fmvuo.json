For many years Christians have screamed \"Purity\" but many have strayed away from actually talking about it. Why is purity such a hard topic? For one, sex is a remarkably intimate and complicated subject. It is the intimate interaction that if mishandled, is a \"sin against the whole body\" (1 Cor.6:18). There is a lot to say about sex, sexuality, purity, relationship, and all the deviations and complications that our sin brings into it. I believe that sexual purity is living rightly in heart, mind, and body to God's ordinances for sex and sexuality (Matthew 22:37; Hebrews 13:4,21:1; 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5). Sex and Sexuality as God intended is between one man and one woman within the covenant of marriage (Genesis 1:26-28, 2:22-24). There are many passages on fleeing from sexual immorality; Sex before marriage, same-sex intercourse, sex with someone other than your spouse, and so on. When Christians seek out purity we should do so not in moralism or asceticism but rather as an act of obedience and worship to Christ. Summarized, Biblical Sexual Purity is living a life of righteousness and obedience to God's word in heart, mind, and body in relation to sex and our sexuality. Unfortunately, like all aspects of life, humanity has not lived this out well, nor has the Church always taught this message holistically. Misunderstood or mishandled purity culture has confused many as they chase after the cross. In some cases, it has even become the stumbling block that they have let come between them and Jesus completely. I want to talk about the purity culture movement, some of the effects we've seen, and how I believe the Bible is calling us to move forward. This is a really important topic to me because, even though I was raised by great parents and with faithful church leaders, sex wasn't something I was taught about. I spent most of my childhood and teenage years hiding sexual confusion, addiction, and loads of questions - and ultimately, I sought out satisfaction and answers in the world. As a result, I have had to do a lot of hard spiritual work with Jesus to help find peace and healing around my views of sex and purity. Frankly, that journey is still going on, and I believe that if the conversation about sex was open and taking place in the church, there would have been a light shone on the darkest and biggest parts of my struggles. The Purity Movement The misconstrued and oversimplified message of purity is a result of many things. Sex is intimate and people have struggled with it since the fall of humanity. As a result, people stray from talking about it vulnerably. Alongside that, people have wrestled with the complexities of Paul's view of sex and sexuality through his harshness and bluntness on the matters in his letters to the early Church. Paul didn't have much to say about healthy sex; instead, he was addressing the sexual immorality of the Church who were living like pagans in orgies and sex worship. Even St. Augustine fell into the lie that that sexual desire was simply unrighteousness or fleshlyness waiting to be perfected. This was a result of his own sexual shortcomings as he bore a son with a concubine and was often misled by his sexual desire. Fast-forward to the 90s, where Christians were \"kissing dating goodbye\" and pushing purity rings harder than drugs. There was a lot of truth in their sentiment and very real reasons to preach a purity message (the Biblical mandate, the consequences of premarital sex, etc.) and realistically they face a lot of teen pregnancy, broken marriages, and even the spread of AIDS. But, with these purity programs came lots of unanswered questions about how people should be thinking about sex and sexuality. While the purity movement was successful in reducing self-disclosed premarital sex and teen pregnancy accounts, many were left with questions and conflicts with the world's sinful sexual revolution. As a result of a lack of Biblical exegesis and fear of talking openly on the matter, many have continued to believe the lies that the world feeds them while hiding it from the church. Multitudes of these purity-ring-laden people were asking questions like; If sex is bad why does my body want it? Is masturbation bad? If I desire sex is something wrong with me? Is porn ok? Does God hate me for being sexually aroused? Are men allowed more sexual freedom than women? Is my worth in my sexual experience? What if I messed up? How far is too far? Am I allowed to talk about this? Nonetheless, while the numbers dropped for a short time, they later skyrocketed alongside a general denial of biblical relevance on the subject of sex. Many Christians have continued to feel just as confused by their desire for sex, the pressing importance of purity, and how to navigate sexual sin. While the whole of Christianity hasn't failed in communicating God's design for sex, where it has failed has resulted in many Christians viewing sexual desire as a fleshly construct that holds one back from true unity with Jesus. While sexual sin is serious and is a huge stumbling block for humanity, we can't - and shouldn't - throw sex and sexuality out completely. Toxic purity culture? Bad (sometimes called Toxic Purity Culture) purity culture is anything that adds to or avoids the whole content of God's commands for sex and sexuality (aka making a suggestion a rule, or a preference of a mandate). Sometimes this culture is communicated explicitly, but most of the time it is communicated casually and unintentionally through silence and shame. BINO held an anonymous survey about the topic of purity and the types of cultures people were raised in concerning the issue. The survey results revealed that many people misunderstood or were misled on the topic of sex and sexuality by schools, churches, or parents. The common issue was that sexual purity was reduced down to physically withholding from penetrative sex before marriage. Other common issues we've seen from the survey are gender specific messages that miscommunicate sexuality, lack of information on specific sexual boundaries, and a failure to address sexual desire or sexuality outside of marriage. Many admitted to having conversations that were centered around shame. Conversations that, when summarized, sounded like this: \"Don't have sex before marriage, don't think about it, and don't talk about it.\" This misses the point of biblical purity and simplifies it to withholding from having penetrative sex before marriage (hear me clearly, I do believe the Bible communicates that God calls His people to sexual purity, but I believe it is deeper than a physical refraining or denial of sexuality). Many of the anonymous survey responses communicated that these conversations were often different for different genders; women were given a more sterilized, unenjoyable depiction of sex and left to believe that sexual purity was what made them a biblical woman; while men were given an allowance for mental and spiritual lust by reducing their purity down to \"controlling the beast.\" Lastly, a large majority reported that sex was reduced down to an animalistic desire that makes them less spiritual. \"It was to be avoided,\" and it was not to be talked about before marriage. Many reported that scare tactics were a large part of these purity conversations, leading them to hold sex in a negative light and feel incapable of redemption if they fell into a perceivably sexually immoral situation. With oversimplified conversations about purity comes confusion about early sexual awakenings, physical and mental urges, masturbation, porn, oral sex, same-sex attraction, lack of desire, and ultimately a lack of preparation for a healthy understanding of sex. Results of \"toxic\" Purity Culture. First of all, give \"toxic purity culture\" a Google search and you will find a plethora of people who were raised in religious homes and are no longer pursuing faith. While I believe these people have a misunderstanding of God's design for marriage and sexuality, there are pieces of true hurt that have resulted from poor purity conversations and false teaching. Many report that they were ostracized from church communities when they were struggling with sexual immorality. In the BINO survey, many people also reported that they were not prepared for the reality of sex, whether that was in their explorations and experience before marriage and the damage it caused, or even a negative relationship with sex when they were in the marriage bed. This misunderstanding led many to feelings of shame and fear, some even to intense feelings of irredeemableness before the throne of God. These are some of the responses that struck the deepest chord in me. These are answers that were given when asked what people were taught about sex and how they felt about the subject. These responses show that the mark can and has been missed by some, and that this isn't a conversation we can simply sweep under the rug. Pursuing Biblical Purity While the whole of Christianity hasn't failed in communicating God's design for sex, it has in many ways missed the opportunity to teach a more redemptive message on sexuality that I believe the Bible contains. In Romans 6:3-11 Paul explains that when you are in Christ you've died to the ways of the world and flesh (also seen in Eph. 2:1-10) and you've been raised up in new life as He was raised from the dead. Therefore, sin no longer reigns over the body, and the redemption we experience in all things is leading to the newness that Jesus ushers into our lives through the spirit (Revelation 21:5). This includes our sexuality and our approach to purity. There simply is no way to answer every question on Biblical Purity in this setting because that would be answering every question on sexuality, gender, and relationships. We'd need a large book series for that. It is appropriate, however, to set straight what God desires from His people regarding sexual purity. I'd like to lay out three approaches to purity that I have personally found a lot of life in. 1. Start with God's Word. I would love to lay out a full study from God's Word and what it says about sex for you, but that would be such a large endeavor. I challenge you to look to God's Word to describe what is true or not true about the role of sex, sexuality, and sexual sin. I will say this, as a personal practice I stick to this statement: If it is outside of God's intended purpose for sex and sexuality, then it is not God's will for me. I see Paul taking seriously the sexual immorality that was in the early church (1 Cor. 6:13, 6:18; 2 Cor 7:1; Galatians 5:19-21, 1 Timothy 4:12, 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5). God's Word lays out limits for our sex and sexuality, but within these limits there is liberty; Liberty to establish that sex and sexual desire, while being a good gift from above, are not to define us or decide our lifestyle. We are to limit sex to one partner of the opposite gender within marriage, but that gives us the liberty to give ourselves without shame, in complete vulnerability, to a partner who is supposed to care deeply about serving us and pointing us to life in Christ. We are to reject that sexual practice or desire is our identity, and instead find liberty in a truer and deeper identity as a creation of God who has purpose in Christ as the Church. The Gospel of Jesus Christ connects us to God and shows us deeply that He cares for His people. Within that care, God commands us to certain things so that we can experience Him and His goodness in a Holy way, and not follow the paths of sin in the world. Pursuing purity and fighting sexual sin is done in worship to Christ, because we know, through the Gospel, that God has a better way for us through His commands. 2. It is not just your body. Sex isn't just about parts touching. Your heart and mind sin and fall into temptation as well. In Matthew 5:28 Jesus says that the one who looks with lustful intent at another has committed adultery. Physical discipline is surely a Godly thing, but it is not the meaning or whole understanding of purity. For example, if I hate someone, but I don't punch them, do I love them? No! Simply reducing sex to physicality is a reduction of it to hormones and orgasm. Song of Solomon surely brings allowance for the enjoyment of the physical, but the love shown within that story is much more than that. Sex is intimate and involves a desire for intimacy and companionship. Just as much, pursuing purity involves disciplining the heart and mind through the power of the Holy Spirit to pursue God's design and trust that His plan holds greater joy. This answers questions we have on subjects like pornography and masturbation. Though we know they have different earthly results and consequences, the source is the same: a person sins when they decide their plan is better than the one that God has provided and called them to. God's plan isn't that we are not sexual, but it surely isn't that we have sex with ourselves or emulate it through pornographic images. Sex is meant to unify and serve the union of marriage. As well, sex and sin surrounding the issue is not simply a matter of physical virginity. When we look at it broadly, a married Christian could even be sinning while having sex with their partner because sin exists even outside of physical disciple. We can sin in our hearts and minds even if the physical act checks the right boxes. Christians must pursue a deeper understanding of God's purposes for sex. 3. Sex isn't bad. I am not married, but I have lots of friends and family who are. And I haven't heard any negative responses to God glorifying sex and the way it brings them and their spouse together. Proverbs 5:18-19 says, \"Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth, a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love.\" That seems like a pretty positive look at the act and union of sexual intercourse within marriage! Sexual purity can exist truly only when the church acknowledges God's purposes for sex. It is a good gift from above, not something to be feared or shameful about. When we look at God's purposes for sex through the lens of the Bible, we do not see something we should hate. We are told to rebuke deviation from the plan for marriage and sex, not hate and hush the whole thing. It was the hushing of the topic that led me to feel shameful about my questions or concerns, even though it was never blatantly communicated that I couldn't ask them. When conversations about sex start becoming open and honest, our children will see that they can find joy within God's plan for sex and the waiting that comes through a life of worship. When we hide the reality of sexual desire and sexual enjoyment from youth, they may satisfy their urge by prematurely participating in the world's broken version of sexual \"fulfillment.\" Ultimately, pursuing purity is much more than our physical failure. While it most certainly includes physical things, it is about the redemption of our full self in Christ. To live a life of purity, teach purity well, and see people live to the worship of God, we must include the full redemption of our minds, hearts, and bodies. Pursuing purity is a challenging but deeply rewarding endeavor that pleases the Lord. I urge you to challenge yourself and ask the hard questions that are holding you back from experiencing new life in Christ in your sex life and sexuality. "}
