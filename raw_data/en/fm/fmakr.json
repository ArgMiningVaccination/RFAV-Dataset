Collaboration is vital when striving for excellence in patient care. The [Critical Care Outreach Team](https://www.rush.edu/health-care-professionals/rush-nursing/about-rush-nursing/critical-care-outreach-team) at Rush has created an event designed to put this collaboration into practice. On Feb. 20, 130 attendees comprised of nurses, practitioners and students from around the Chicago area and beyond gathered at Rush University Medical Center to celebrate and learn from each other at CCOT's second annual Critical Care Outreach Symposium. Nurses from Illinois, Wisconsin and Ohio attended the event, which brought critical care nurses together for both education and collaboration. CCOT asked themselves, \"what can fellow nurses glean from each other to be more efficient in providing an ever better quality of care?\" Through simulation and poster contests to a variety of guest speakers and group discussions, it was a day that brought new ideas to the table. \"We are getting good responses and feedback, getting to share with our colleagues in nursing and trying to grow our team in rapid response,\" Jackie Hoskins, BSN, RN and president-elect of the Medical Center's Professional Nursing Practice said at the event. Forming relationships with numerous hospitals to work and grow together, participants were able to discuss and bring back new ideas to implement into their everyday work life. \"It's so exciting to see so many people come together to improve the care of patients,\" explained Holly Losurdo, MSN, RN, critical care outreach nurse and team lead at Rush. The symposium kicked off with a four-team simulation contest. While using simulations for critical care training is common, this one had a fresh twist: it was modeled after the popular \"escape room\" games. Teams had to complete one set of problems before being able to continue onto the next, and so on. Hannah Prins, RN, who works at UChicago Medicine, participated in the simulation with the rapid response team she works with daily, which won the contest. \"It was really helpful,\" Prins said. \"It helped me get into a different frame of mind.\" Following the simulation contest, guest speakers presented new research and shared their experiences in critical care. Featured speakers included Lorna Dudzik, DNP, RN, APN, CNS, and assistant professor at Lewis University College of Nursing & Health sciences on \"Resuscitation Quality Improvement;\" and Amie Gamino, MD, and assistant professor and assistant critical care medicine director at Rush on \"Interdisciplinary Collaboration in CCOT.\" Participants of the symposium also created and displayed posters relating to various research, methods and new ideas for critical care. Each poster came with a QR code for attendees to scan, giving them the ability to see a version of each poster on their phone and save it for later to bring back to their own departments. The symposium attendees particularly enjoyed the networking aspect. Event coordinators made sure to give the numerous nurses, students and practitioners plenty of time to foster relationships and learn from each other. The excitement was evident on participants' faces as they shared experiences and bonded over their passion of caring for patients. While the job in rapid response can be a hard one, it was easy to see every single person in the room loved what they do and appreciated the time they were getting to build a camaraderie with people who had the same passions. Heather Cook, BSN, RN, CCRN, and a team lead for Rush's critical care outreach, was enthusiastic about the amount of engagement the symposium saw. \"I'm honored that all of these nurses came here to learn about this specialty,\" she said. \"We get to set the standards for (critical) care by having this and have felt so supported by Rush to hold it.\" While the Critical Care Outreach Symposium is only in its second year, it is a growing success, because it meets the need Rush's critical care outreach team saw for the rapid response community to come together and collaborate. \"All of our hospital peers have critical care patients that provide intensive nursing care and acute care nurses need the support and resources to assist in providing excellent care too,\" said Shonda Morrow, AVP, nursing finance and resource management at Rush. \"As in any industry you need to come together and ask, 'this is what we've done but how can we do better?'\" Dr. Badrinath R.

Martha Clare Morris, ScD, a leading researcher internationally of diet and cognitive function and lead creator of the MIND diet, died Feb. 15. [Martha Clare Morris, ScD,](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty) a pioneering researcher of the connection between diet and Alzheimer's disease, died peacefully following a battle with cancer on Feb. 15 in her home in Oak Park, Illinois, surrounded by her family. She was 64 years old. Morris was a professor in the Department of Internal Medicine, assistant provost of community research and the director of the [Rush Institute for Healthy Aging](http://www.riha.rush.edu/) at Rush University Medical Center. She also was director of the internal medicine department's Section of Community Epidemiology. For more than 20 years, her work in nutrition and dementia was funded by numerous grants and resulted in many important findings published in high impact medical journals. Since 2017, she had led a nationwide clinical trial of the effectiveness of a diet she helped develop in preventing Alzheimer's dementia. \"Dr. Morris pioneered and promoted the use of diet as a medicine to keep the brain healthy. Her studies have paved the way for more in-depth characterizations. Her impact on Rush has been tremendous, and her contributions will have a long-lasting impact on our community and the scientific community around the world,\" said [Dr. Ali Keshavarzian](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/ali-keshavarzian-md), the Josephine M. Dyrenforth Chair of Gastroenterology and chief of the Division of Digestive Diseases at Rush. \"She was an outstanding human being, an exceptional scientist and dear colleague. She will be greatly missed,\" Keshavarzian added. Early in her career, Morris realized there was a correlation between nutrition and dementia and set out to find the science to prove it. \"She had the insight to apply dietary epidemiology to the causes of Alzheimer's disease. That's a very strong insight, and she had it very early,\" said [Dr. Denis Evans](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/news/founding-father-alzheimers-fight), Morris' predecessor as director of the Institute for Healthy Aging. At the time, few studies had explored this link, and Morris worked hard to fight the misconception and biases that dementia was merely a genetic disease. Despite a lack of initial support and funding from the larger scientific community, Morris' unrelenting pursuit of her studies greatly contributed to the burgeoning field of nutritional epidemiology that exists today. [Dr. Julie Schneider](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/julie-schneider-md-ms-0) saw Morris' passion and never quit attitude when she first arrived at Rush in 1996. \"She was just an amazing person. Whether funding for grants was good or bad, she always pursued her research and never gave up,\" recalled Schneider, the Deborah R. And Edgar D. Jannotta Presidential Professor of Pathology and Neurological Sciences and the associate director of the [Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/research/departmental-research/rush-alzheimers-disease-center) (RADC). They also immediately became friends, bonding over their pursuit of better understanding of Alzheimer's. \"Even though I was a neurologist and neuropathologist, and she was a nutritional epidemiologist, we would find ourselves having conversations about what was happening in the brain and different vitamins related to cognitive decline,\" Schneider said. \"Martha Clare was an extraordinarily hard worker, and her dedication was a very important factor in her success,\" said Evans, who first hired Morris to work for him when he was at Harvard University and then recruited her to Rush in 1992. \"When you come in as a pioneer in the field, your first efforts rarely meet with the success they deserve, but her efforts from the start were published in excellent journals.\" Morris' hard work and perseverance paid off. A series of her studies revealed various nutrients associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's and cognitive decline. Those studies resulted in a pilot grant from the Rush Translational Sciences Consortium to measure diet among participants of the RADC's [Memory and Aging Project](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/research/departmental-research/memory-and-aging-project), a long term study of memory loss in older adults. This work led to Morris' breakthrough achievement: the creation of the MIND diet. Taking results from her research and incorporating elements of various diets, she developed the MIND diet with colleagues at both Rush and Harvard. Morris published her initial findings on the MIND Diet in Alzheimer's & Dementia: the Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, in 2015. It took the science community by storm. The MIND diet recently was ranked [among the top 10 diets](https://www.rush.edu/news/press-releases/rushs-mind-diet-again-ranked-among-best-0) for a fifth consecutive year in U.S. News & World Report and was deemed to have not only long-term cognitive benefits but cardiovascular health benefits as well. In all, the MIND diet was ranked in seven categories this year. The excitement around the findings of the MIND diet inspired Morris to author the book Diet for the Mind, which was published in 2017. The book summarizes the benefits of the MIND diet and Morris' lifelong research into the connection between nutrition and the prevention of cognitive decline, and includes 80 brain-healthy recipes that were designed by her culinary trained daughter, Laura. Morris' creation of the MIND diet led to a [large clinical trial](https://www.rush.edu/news/press-releases/study-diets-impact-dementia-alzheimers-disease-begins-january) currently underway to evaluate the link between the MIND diet and cognitive decline. The first study of its kind, the trial received funding through a $14.5M grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and began in 2017. \"She was on her way to get further answers about how nutrition affects brain health,\" said Dr. Jochen Reiser, the Ralph C Brown, MD professor and chairperson of the [Department of Internal Medicine](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/rush-medical-college/departments/department-internal-medicine) at Rush. \"To be funded by the NIH allowed her to address this very important question.\" She also was a principal investigator or co-investigator of more than a half dozen NIH-funded studies of diet and nutrition's effects on Alzheimer's disease and other neurological conditions. Her collaborators on these studies included Schneider, Keshavarzian and others at Rush; peers at other Chicago research universities; and colleagues in the United States and Australia. Morris was an author or contributor to more than 80 articles in peer-reviewed journals and served two terms (from 2011 to 2013) as chair of the NIH's Neurological, Aging and Musculoskeletal Epidemiology Study Section. In addition, she helped expand Rush's research capacity. \"Martha Clare was an integral part of Rush's successful application for a Clinical and Translational Science Award from the National Institutes of Health, in partnership with the University of Chicago,\" says [Dr. Joshua Jacobs](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/joshua-j-jacobs-md), vice president for research of Rush's [Department of Orthopedic Surgery](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/rush-medical-college/departments/department-orthopedic-surgery). \"This CTSA award has allowed Rush to join a national network of leading academic medical centers that aims to accelerate the translation of biomedical research advancements to improvements in public health. Martha Clare's contributions to this effort were profound. We are deeply grateful for all that she has done for the Rush research enterprise and for her impactful contributions to science.\" \"She essentially passed away at the pinnacle of her success,\" Evans said. The MIND diet has grown into a multi-institutional effort to study aspects of the diet in brain health, inflammation and the microbiome (the microbes inside the human body). Harvard, Duke University and other institutions have become involved and led a variety of projects. Morris was involved with the selection of each study's leadership, and every aspect of the MIND diet has been vetted through her - a testament to her commitment to the prevention of dementia and cognitive decline. She inspired researchers and scientists throughout the world. Schneider said that colleagues from Europe, Australia, Canada and elsewhere have expressed their condolences and shared their grief over Morris' passing. \"She was always enthusiastic and passionate about her work. It was a huge loss, for the dementia research community within and outside of Rush,\" Schneider said. Morris (n\u00e9e Chinn) grew up in Homewood, Illinois. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees in sociology from the University of Iowa in Iowa City, where she met her late husband, James Morris, whom she married in 1978. She worked as a clinical coordinator for Dr. Robert Wallace, an endowed professor in the University of Iowa's School of Public Health and member of the Institute of Medicine. While she and her husband lived in Iowa, they had three children. She also was three years into earning a doctorate from UI when her work directing one of Wallace's studies drew a job offer from Harvard University Medical School. Morris moved her family to Boston, with her husband's support. \"He wanted her to flourish,\" their son Patrick said. She worked as a project director on Harvard studies at Brigham and Women's Hospital and soon resumed her pursuit of a doctorate at Harvard's School of Public Health \u2014 while also raising her young children. This daunting juggling act was the happiest time of her life because, for Morris, \"it was balanced,\" said her daughter Clare Crowley. Morris studied under famed diet researcher Dr. Walter Willett, at the time the chair of the Department of Nutrition, and received her ScD in epidemiology in 1992. Morris threw herself into her personal passions as fervently as she did her work. She loved parties, dancing and music, particularly the blues. She played piano, sang in church choirs and never turned down an opportunity to take in a live musical play or concert. She also loved the outdoors and adventure travel, including mountain biking in Mexico, ocean kayaking in Vancouver and hiking in Big Sky, Montana. \"She was a force of nature, force of energy, force of love,\" her daughter Laura said. Her husband passed away in 2012. In addition to her children, Morris is survived by her sister, Emma Jane Conley, brother, March Chinn, and sister-in-law Cathy; sons-in-law Pete Crowley and Dr. Darcy Marr and daughter-in-law Rachel; six grandchildren, whom she loved playing with; and dozens of nieces and nephews. A celebration of her life will be held on Saturday, March 14, at 11 a.m. at the 19th Century Club, 178 Forest Ave. in Oak Park. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations in Morris' memory be made to [the Alzheimer's Association](https://www.alz.org/). The Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force's new name, Equal Hope, reflects the expansion of the non-profit's scope to eliminate cervical cancer deaths in Chicago. A nonprofit organization that helped narrow the racial gap in breast cancer deaths has expanded its scope to eliminating cervical cancer deaths for all women in Chicago. Housed and developed at Rush University Medical Center, the Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force was established in 2008 in response to research showing that the city's black women were dying of breast cancer at much higher rates than white women. In November, the task force changed its name to Equal Hope, \"because all women should have equal hope of high quality health care, and anyone facing serious illness should have equal hope for their future,\" said the organization's executive director, Anne Marie Murphy, PhD. \"No woman should ever die of [cervical cancer](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/cervical-cancer), a disease that's almost 100 percent preventable. We know what causes it, we know how to prevent it, and it's time to end it,\" she added. [Dr. Summer Dewdney](https://doctors.rush.edu/Details/1718), who is co-leading Equal Hope's cervical cancer effort, lamented that the promise of being able to prevent cervical cancer has not mattered to the many patients she sees with advanced stages of the disease. \"I see these young women who are in their 30s or 40s with these horrible cervical cancers \u2014 advanced stage 3, 4. These are diseases you should be seeing in Third World countries or where they don't have health care,\" said Dewdney, a gynecologic oncologist at Rush. She was aware of the breast cancer effort being led by [Dr. David Ansell](https://www.rush.edu/about-us/about-rush/leadership/david-ansell-md-mph-about-rush), Rush's senior vice president for community health equity and co-founder of the task force. \"So I just knocked on his door and said, 'Hey, can we do this for cervical cancer?'\" The task force and its hospital and clinical partners have been able to reduce disparities in breast cancer mortality in Chicago from a 62% death gap to a 39% gap over the past decade. They achieved this dramatic, life-saving result by improving the quality of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment for women in underserved communities, helping them navigate the health care system, and advocating for policy change. Dewdney and colleagues from across Chicago are now attempting to apply the lessons learned in breast cancer to cervical cancer. \"Every woman that we see is a missed opportunity and an example that the system has failed,\" Dewdney said. Using data provided by the Chicago Department of Health, Equal Hope researchers from Rush, Northwestern Medicine and University of Chicago Medicine found that cervical cancer racial disparities were shocking, as shown in the following data: Dewdney explained that eradication of the disease is possible because it is almost 100% preventable by vaccination and pre-cancer screening. Australia, for example, recently announced it expects to eradicate cervical cancer by 2028, and Rwanda has succeeded in getting 94% of its adolescents fully vaccinated within three years. Researchers at Rush University Medical Center, in collaboration with colleagues at other institutions, have revealed a new treatment target that may help change the outcome for patients at risk of AKI. Up to 10% of patients who are hospitalized or undergo surgery will experience acute kidney injury (AKI), and as many as 50% of patients in intensive care units will meet the criteria for AKI, the National Kidney Foundation has determined. Some of these patients will progress to [kidney failure](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/renal-failure) within months. Researchers at Rush University Medical Center, in collaboration with colleagues at other institutions, have revealed a new treatment target that may help change the outcome for patients at risk of AKI. The results were published Jan. 29 in [The New England Journal of Medicine](http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1911481). \"In this study, we found evidence that a specific protein produced by immune cells in the bone marrow, called soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR,) is a strong risk factor for acute forms of kidney failure, that occur as consequence of general medical procedures,\" said [Jochen Reiser, MD, PhD](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/jochen-reiser-md-phd), a professor at Rush University Medical Center and chairperson of Rush's [Department of Internal Medicine](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/rush-medical-college/departments/department-internal-medicine). Reiser is senior author of the study. suPAR has been repeatedly shown to harm kidneys. Chronically elevated blood levels are linked to development of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), a paper published by Reiser and colleagues in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2015. Now, the new paper is showing that having elevated suPAR levels is also a risk factor for acute kidney injury - a sudden decline in kidney function that can be a severe side effect of general medical procedures. \"Nephrology has found its global risk molecule: suPAR,\" said Reiser. \"Any kidney disease, chronic or acute, genetic or acquired, is better off with a lower suPAR level. By looking at suPAR levels in patients, we can possibly prevent damage to healthy kidneys that is often irreversible.\" Reiser believes that high suPAR levels will inform physician-patient conversations about preventing kidney disease, just as high cholesterol levels signal the need for lifestyle changes and protective drugs, such as statins, to avert heart attacks and strokes. \"We have known for some time now of suPAR's important role in kidney disease. Here we show that suPAR is relevant in important clinical situations such as coronary angiography and cardiac surgery, and could be targeted to minimize the risk of AKI,\" said Salim Hayek, MD, a cardiologist at the Michigan Medicine Frankel Cardiovascular Center and first author of the study. Reiser, Hayek and colleagues performed a two-pronged investigation of suPAR. First, they looked at suPAR levels and the risk of acute kidney injury in three clinical settings. \"We collected blood samples from patients about to undergo coronary angiography for suspected heart disease, patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and critically ill patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit,\" said David E. Leaf, MD, a co-first author on the study and the director acute kidney injury research at Brigham and Women's Hospital of Harvard Medical School. The team found that suPAR levels independently predicted risk of AKI in each of these clinical settings. If a person had higher suPAR levels before undergoing coronary angiography or cardiac surgery, or upon admission to the intensive care unit, they were at much greater risk of developing AKI afterwards. These associations were entirely independent of other clinical characteristics, such as age, gender, race, severity of illness, and baseline kidney function. The team divided patients into quartiles based on how high their suPAR levels were and compared outcomes for patients across quartiles. They found that risk of AKI increased steadily with increasing suPAR levels, with an increase of 3.5 to four times the risk of AKI for those in the highest quartile compared to the lowest. High SuPAR levels consistently predicted AKI in these patients, with levels above 3,000 picograms per milliliter doubling the risk of AKI. In total, the study included 4,769 patients. These findings led the researchers to the second phase of the study. They employed mouse models of acute kidney injury to investigate whether high suPAR is actually a contributing cause of the complication. When the mice were exposed to contrast used in patients undergoing coronary angiography, the researchers found that higher levels of suPAR led to worsening of kidneys compared to mice with normal levels. \"We are studying interventions to alter suPAR levels,\" said Reiser. \"We found that when mice were pretreated with a monoclonal antibody to block suPAR, the researchers managed to reduce the development and the severity of kidney injury.\" While the researchers are looking at utilizing treatments and medications already used for other purposes, like statins or immune modulators, they have also sparked the creation of novel humanized suPAR antibodies that once fully developed will be explored in clinical trials. Funding for this work was provided by the National Institutes of Health, American Heart Association, American Society of Nephrology Foundation for Kidney Research Carl W. Gottschalk Research Scholar Grant, the Hutter Family Professorship, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and by the American Society of Nephrology Foundation for Kidney Research George B. Rathmann Research Fellowship Award. Co-authors Jochen Reiser and Sanja Sever, PhD, are co-founders and shareholders of Trisaq, a Cambridge-based biotech company that develops therapy against suPAR and kidney disease. Kyran Quinlan, MD, MPH, a pediatrician at Rush University Medical Center, has focused his research and advocacy on making microwave ovens safer to protect young children from severe scalds. [Kyran Quinlan, MD, MPH](https://doctors.rush.edu/Details/1149), a pediatrician at Rush University Medical Center, has focused his research and advocacy on making microwave ovens safer to protect young children from severe scalds. He and his team's efforts over the last 15 years recently led to a change in the national standard for microwave ovens. To meet the new Underwriters Laboratories standard, microwave makers will be required to design and produce microwaves with \"child-resistant\" doors, making them more difficult for young children to open. Quinlan and his team shared these results in an abstract that was chosen as the Program Description Abstract of the Year during the annual conference of the Injury Free Coalition for Kids, held in December in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Quinlan, a professor and the director of the division of general pediatrics at Rush, shared this honor with coauthors [Gina Lowell, MD, MPH](https://doctors.rush.edu/Details/1149), an assistant professor of pediatrics at Rush, and Marla Robinson, OTRL, and Lawrence Gottlieb, MD, from the burn unit at University of Chicago Medicine. \"Every year at the Injury Free Conference, I am inspired by all the amazing work to prevent child injury being done at sites all around the country, so it was a real honor to for us to receive this award,\" Quinlan said. Research by Quinlan's team using National Electronic Injury Surveillance System data showed that during the last decade, an estimated 7,000 children were treated in U.S. emergency departments for burns suffered when they opened microwave doors and spilled the heated contents. Part of Quinlan's work included focused research presented at multiple national meetings. He worked with the child product safety advocacy group Kids in Danger to enlist college engineering students to design child-resistant microwave doors to demonstrate their feasibility and created [a short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=b2bPcxoOFFY&feature=emb_logo) to put a face to the statistics. Quinlan's abstract was selected from those submitted across the country and judged on variety of subjects. These included whether the research topic identified a new area of study and/or addressed the topic in a novel and unique manner, and the scientific validity of the research methodology, among others. \"It takes determination and perseverance to do work that makes that kind of difference,\" said Barbara Barlow, MD, the founder and executive director of the Injury Free Coalition for Kids. \"This project showed that persistence and working with manufacturers and licensing groups can yield a safer microwave oven,\" said Marlene Melzer Lange, MD, the Injury Free Coalition for Kids Scientific Publication's Committee chair. \"The advocacy of Dr. Quinlan and his team will prevent many microwave scald burns via improvements of microwave design.\" The Injury Free Coalition for Kids is a group of 45 Level I US pediatric trauma centers using local trauma data to drive and evaluate the effectiveness of prevention programs to protect children. Modeled after the pioneering work of Dr. Barlow in Harlem, NY, the coalition was formed in 1995 to apply her successful model to areas served by trauma centers across the country. Oncologists at Rush University Medical Center are among the first in the country to be able to have results of genomic tests returned directly into the electronic medical record. Rush University Medical Center is the first health care organization to launch medical record company Epic's module for genomic results, giving providers the tools they need to tailor patient care at the molecular level. Rush will use the module as part of its [Precision Oncology Program](https://www.rush.edu/services/precision-oncology-program) to integrate the power of genomic sequencing data into oncologists' daily workflows so they can provide the best care for their patients. \"To really deliver on the promise of precision oncology, providers need to access, interpret and apply this genomic information where and when clinical decisions are made: the EHR,\" said [Dr. Mia Levy](https://www.rush.edu/services/cancer-center/meet-mia-levy-md-phd), the Sheba Foundation Director of the [Rush University Cancer Center](https://www.rush.edu/services/cancer-center) and a national leader in biomedical informatics. \"This new technology makes point-of-care insights and interventions possible.\" The module unlocks critical data and seamlessly weaves structured results of genomic testing into the workflows of the cancer care team. When a Rush physician believes that a patient would benefit from genomic testing, the physician sends a tumor and/or blood sample to Tempus, Rush's [ genomic testing partner](https://www.rush.edu/news/customizing-cancer-care-patients). Tempus' identify a patient's actionable genomic variants and yield therapeutic options \u2014 including matched clinical trials \u2014 associated with the patient's molecular and clinical profile. Tempus' report flows directly into Epic, allowing clinicians to make data-driven decisions customized to each patient. Integrating genomic data into the electronic health record (EHR) provides clinicians with a single view of a patient's genomic and other clinical information. \"Until now, to the best of our knowledge, no other external lab has been able to seamlessly integrate next generation sequencing genomic testing directly into an electronic medical record as structured variant results, and we are thrilled to bring this new functionality to the market and providers with Rush,\" said Ryan Fukushima, Tempus' chief operating officer. \"Epic's new module allows clinicians to order a Tempus test with a click of a button, and merges those test results into a patient's record, arming the care team with all the data needed to make treatment decisions in real time.\" \"Cancer is a disease of the genome,\" Levy said. \"But the tiny changes in our DNA that allow some cells to become cancer cells also provide clues to how we can treat and prevent cancer. Connecting genomic data with the rest of a patient's story provides a more complete picture.\" Levy noted that while the ability to detect and analyze those changes to a person's genome \u2014 the complete set of genetic instructions found in their DNA \u2014 has grown exponentially in the last several years, the ability to translate that information into specific and practical therapies was limited by the structural inability of EHRs make that data part of the clinical workflow. Thus, in 2018, Rush oncologists and technologists began collaborating with Epic developers to design the genomics module. \"When developing new features, we focus on how they'll fit into the overall workflow for clinicians and ultimately provide actionable information to improve patient care,\" said Catherine Procknow, an Epic software developer who works on the genomics module. \"Dr. Levy worked closely with us as a member of our genomics brain trust to provide guidance on how to design our module in a way that was most useful to clinicians and beneficial to patients.\" The module provides a specialized data structure to enable providers - even those without a genomics background - to integrate genomics information into their clinical decision-making process. It turns raw data from gene tests, genetic panels, and complete sequencing into actionable genomic indicators, which are stored in a patient's chart. Researchers will be able to integrate de-identified, structured genomic data into their efforts to discover new methods of predicting cancer risk, prognosis and response to treatment. The ability to compare genomic data with medical histories and other clinical data will accelerate the pace of discovery. \"Cancer care has reached a pivotal moment when the amazing promise of genomic medicine is actually part of the daily practice of medicine,\" said [Dr. Ranga Krishnan](https://www.rush.edu/about-us/about-rush/leadership-biographies/k-ranga-rama-krishnan-mb-chb-rush-system-ceo-about-rush), CEO of [Rush University System for Health](https://www.rush.edu/excellence). \"We've long known that cancer cells contain the clues physicians need to identify treatments precisely designed according to a patient's DNA, but few providers had the expertise to decode that information. Integrating genomic test results into the electronic medical record\u2014where point of care decisions are made - makes the power of cancer genomics part of routine cancer care at Rush.\" On Jan. 23, NASEM will hold an event providing community members with the opportunity to learn more about a recently released study on the need to integrate social care into health care delivery. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) recently released a study report about the need to integrate social care into health care delivery. On Jan. 23, NASEM will hold an event providing community members with the opportunity to learn more about the report and respond to it. The event will be held from 12:30 to 4 p.m. in the Brainard Room, fifth floor of the Rush University Medical Center Professional Building, 1725 W. Harrison Ave. [Released last September](https://www.rush.edu/news/press-releases/addressing-social-needs-health-care-delivery-can-improve-health-outcomes), NASEM's report, \"Integrating Social Care into the Delivery of Health Care: Moving Upstream to Improve the Nation's Health,\" highlights the importance of paying attention to a patient's social conditions when providing care. These conditions include housing, transportation and access to food. The report highlights the importance of these social conditions and how they can affect the delivery and outcome of a patient's health care. Robyn Golden, associate vice president, population health and aging at Rush University Medical Center, will speak at the event. Golden served on the NASEM committee on Integrating Social Needs Care into the Delivery of Health Care to Improve the Nation's Health, which issued the report. NASEM's event at Rush will give attendees a chance to learn more about the consensus committee's recommendations as well as hear local leaders' responses to the study in a panel discussion. The consensus committee sets five goals for successful integration of social care. They include using five health care system activities: building a workforce, developing a digital infrastructure, financing the integration of social care and funding research. The committee believes these goals may result in improved health and reducing health disparities throughout the area. Attendees will have a chance to brainstorm and talk with each other about the best way to take the committee's recommendations and \"Build a Chicagoland response.\" These opportunities include breakout discussions and learning about activities \u2014 also known as the \"5As\" \u2014 that can facilitate the integration of social care. Participants will be able to use this information to create a strategy for using social factors when delivering health care in the Chicago area. The event is available to diverse stakeholders at no cost, and a livestream will be available for those who can't attend in person.

Rush University College of Nursing was named No. 1 in the nation in the graduate nursing programs category on U.S. News & World Report's 2020 Best Online Programs list. Rush University College of Nursing rose to the No. 1 spot among 183 schools eligible for the graduate nursing programs category in U.S. News & World Report's 2020 [Best Online Programs list](https://www.usnews.com/education/online-education) released today. \"We could not be prouder to be at the top of a list of so many esteemed nursing schools,\" said Barbara Swanson, PhD, RN, FAAN, interim dean of the [College of Nursing](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/college-nursing). \"It speaks volumes about the quality of the faculty and staff at Rush who are so committed to preparing superb practitioners and leaders in nursing, regardless of student location.\" The College of Nursing's top spot is the culmination of a steady climb up the list for the school since it ranked No. 13 in 2015, and this marks the second straight year it has ranked in the top five (No. 4 in 2019). In addition, the College of Nursing is first on the 2020 list of Best Online Nursing Programs for Veterans and in the top three in four of the new online specialty rankings introduced by U.S. News this year: Distance learning plays a key role in helping to solve the U.S.'s nursing shortage. Through 2026, 203,700 new nurses are needed each year to fill newly created positions and replace retiring nurses, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Advanced practice nurses, functioning in both inpatient and outpatient settings, can increase accessibility to high quality and cost-effective care. This is particularly true for underserved rural and urban populations. \"Providing online education access to nursing students is crucial as the nursing shortage continues to grow,\" Swanson said. \"This is especially important in addressing the health care crisis and the number of people in desperate need of care in rural areas of the country.\" The College of Nursing ranked first nationwide in the Faculty Credentials and Training part of U.S. News' assessment. That category accounts for 20% of the score U.S. News uses to rank online programs. College of Nursing online students have access to the same clinical experts who advise and teach on-campus students. The remaining 80% of U.S. News' online program rankings are calculated based on the following categories: Nursing programs are offered from the master's through the doctoral (DNP and PhD) levels. The following are the college's [degree options](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/college-nursing/programs-admissions) available online: The College of Nursing has a [national reputation](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/college-nursing/college-nursing-rankings) for excellence, consistently ranking among the top nursing schools in the nation. Among the nation's 552 nursing colleges with graduate programs, Rush ranks in the top 1% overall for Doctor of Nursing Practice programs and top 3% for Master of Science in Nursing programs in the 2020 edition of U.S. News' America's Best Graduate Schools survey. Four programs rank among the top two in the nation: The following Doctor of Nursing Practice programs are also ranked in the top 10: The College of Nursing's heritage dates back to 1885, when its first antecedent, the St. Luke's Hospital Training School of Nursing, opened to offer diploma education to nurses. Today, well over 7,000 baccalaureate, master's and doctoral students have graduated from the College of Nursing. Researchers at Rush University Medical Center have found that injecting tumors with influenza vaccines, including some FDA-approved seasonal flu shots, turns cold tumors to hot, a discovery that could lead to an immunotherapy to treat cancer. Researchers at Rush University Medical Center have found that injecting tumors with influenza vaccines, including some FDA-approved seasonal flu shots, turns \"cold\" tumors to \"hot,\" a discovery that could lead to an immunotherapy to treat cancer. The study results were published Dec. 30 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Changing the microenvironment of tumors to increase the immune system's response to them has been the goal of countless research and clinical studies including the most recent use of checkpoint inhibitory antibodies. The majority of patients have tumors that are \"cold\" \u2014 that is, the tumors don't contain many immune cells, or they have cells that suppress the ability of the immune system to fight them. Increasing immune cells within a tumor can change it from \"cold\" to \"hot\" \u2014 more recognizable to the immune system. Hot tumors show higher rates of response to treatment, and patients with such tumors have improved survival rates. Currently, some immunotherapies utilize live pathogens (disease-causing organisms) as cancer treatments, but these treatments only have shown lasting effects in a limited number of patients and cancer types. \"We wanted to understand how our strong immune responses against pathogens like influenza and their components could improve our much weaker immune response against some tumors,\" said [Andrew Zloza, MD, PhD](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/andrew-zloza-md-phd), assistant professor in [Rush Medical College's](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/education-and-training) [Department of Internal Medicine](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/rush-medical-college/departments/department-internal-medicine) and senior author of the study. Drawing on a National Cancer Institute database, researchers found that people who had lung cancer and hospitalization for a lung infection from influenza at the same time lived longer than those who had lung cancer with no influenza. They found a similar outcome in mice with tumors and influenza infection in the lung. \"However, there are many factors we do not understand about live infections, and this effect does not repeat in tumors where influenza infections do not naturally occur, like skin,\" Zloza said. To find an alternative to the limitations of live infection, researchers inactivated the influenza virus, essentially creating a flu vaccine. They found that direct injection of this vaccine into the skin melanoma of the mice resulted in the tumors either growing slower or shrinking. The injection made the tumor hot by increasing the proportion of a type of immune-stimulating cells (called dendritic cells) in the tumor, leading to an increase in a type of cells known as CD8+ T cells, which recognize and kill tumor cells. Importantly, injecting a skin melanoma tumor on one side of the body not only resulted in the reduced growth of that tumor, but also in reduced growth of a second skin tumor on the other side of the same mouse that was not injected. The study authors note that they observed similar systemic outcomes in a mouse model of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, in which both primary tumor growth and the natural spread of the breast tumor to the lungs were reduced after injection only into the primary tumor. \"Based on this result, we hope that in patients, injecting one tumor with an influenza vaccine with lead to immune responses in their other tumors as well,\" Zloza said. \"Our successes with a flu vaccine that we created made us wonder if seasonal flu vaccines that are already FDA-approved could be repurposed as treatments for cancer,\" Zloza said. \"Since these have been used in millions of people and have already been shown to be safe, we thought using flu shots to treat cancer could be brought to patients quickly.\" The researchers found that injection of such flu shots also resulted in reduction of tumor growth. To determine if similar results could be obtained with tumors from patients, the researchers developed a mouse model, which they call AIR-PDX. To create this model, they implant a piece of tumor and immune cells from a patient with cancer into a mouse that does not have a functioning immune system of its own - which prevents the mouse from rejecting the implanted cells. \"Such transplant allows us to utilize patient-grade drugs in a living system. This is as close as we can get to testing something ahead of a clinical trial,\" Zloza said. The researchers used a patient's lung tumor and a melanoma metastasis in AIR-PDX models. They found that putting the flu shot in these patient-derived tumors causes them to shrink, while untreated tumors continued to grow. Since new treatments are often compared to or combined with current frontline therapies for cancer, the researchers used immune checkpoint inhibitors in their studies. Immune checkpoint inhibition \"releases the brakes\" on immune cells so that they can fight the tumor. The researchers found that flu vaccines can reduce tumor growth when used alone, whether or not the tumor is responsive to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. When they combined the flu vaccine with a checkpoint inhibitor together, an even a greater reduction in tumor growth occurred. \"These results propose that eventually both patients who respond and who do not respond to other immunotherapies might benefit from the injection of influenza vaccines into the tumor, and it may increase the small proportion of patients that are now long-term responders to immunotherapies,\" Zloza said. Five different influenza shots for the 2017-2018 flu season were used in this research. Four were effective in achieving the same results in fighting tumors. One flu shot with a synthetic adjuvant (an immune modifier) had no antitumor effect, and maintained other cells (called regulatory B cells or Bregs) that suppress an immune response. When the adjuvant was removed from the vaccine, it became effective. Similarly, when the B cells were removed, the vaccine also then became effective. That all five vaccines provided protection from flu infection, but one was ineffective in reducing tumor growth \"demonstrates a disconnect between the principals of immune responses needed to fight pathogens versus tumors,\" Zloza said. \"It also highlights the need for additional consideration regarding what adjuvants are included in immunotherapies and which vaccines could be used to treat cancer.\" \"Since humans and mice are about 95% genetically identical, the hope is that this approach will work in patients. The next step planned is to conduct clinical trials to test various factors,\" Zloza said. Clinical trials on average require four phases and can take between eight to 10 years to complete, but because the seasonal influenza vaccine is FDA-approved, the clinical trials for this study might be significantly shorter. \"Although we are currently studying the use of other vaccines as well, the seasonal flu shot is safe and recommended for most people over 6 months of age, including most patients with cancer,\" Zloza said. \"This is why we chose to start with it. \"The flu shot is inexpensive and it has a quick translatability since it is an FDA-approved drug that we are repurposing,\" Zloza continued.
