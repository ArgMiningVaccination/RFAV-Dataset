Meditation stimulates one's immune system and fights against illness. It has been observed that the vibrations produced by thoughts and emotions reach every cell and bone of the body and that negative thoughts can impede the cells' regeneration and homeostasis capacity. The requirement of focusing on positive thoughts during meditation is to promote health and well-being at a cellular level. Each day your brain processes multiple thoughts, meditation lets you concentrate on one thought at a time. It leaves the mind at peace. Meditation is a special technique for resting the mind and attaining a state of consciousness which is a state apart from waking state. While meditating, one is completely alert, but one's mind is not focused on the worldly commotion. Neither is the mind asleep nor hallucinating instead, it is clear, relaxed and inwardly focused. Kairali-The Ayurvedic Healing Village endeavors to offer seekers a platform to ward off this urbanized tension by the means of meditation in complete tranquility. Ayurvedic meditation leads way to a state of exultation in an environment that lets you absorb all the positive and natural energy. This is a proven way to fight against negativity and its continued use is bound to bring only joy and contentment. Meditation physically calms and heals, emotionally strengthens, and releases mental strain; all to reach higher levels of consciousness and attain self-realization. Mind is bound to think for 24 hours, but at Kairali, seekers are guided to meditate where mind thwarts thinking, stop experiencing emotions, and is able to start afresh. "}
