The mother reports that the patient has not been feeling well for the past couple of days, with nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, gener- alized abdominal pain, and decreased urine output. Medical and family histories are noncontributory. The mother and patient recently traveled to India for their yearly 1-month visit to family members and returned approximately 2 to 3 weeks ago. The primary care physician evaluated the patient with a rapid streptococcal test and a throat culture for streptococcal pharyngitis, a rapid antibody test for infectious mononucleosis, and a blood smear for malaria; all of these results were negative. On day 5 of illness, the patient is brought again to the primary care physician 'so fce and is subsequently sent to the emergency department for further management. The patient has continued with persistent fevers and chills for the past 5 days. Her maximum measured temperature was 103\u00b0F (39.4\u00b0C) at home, and the mother reports that fevers subside with antipyretic use. On physical examination the patient is noted to have unremarkable vital signs, looks well, and has no signi cantndings. Therefore, the patient is discharged with instructions for supportive care for a likely viral illness given that her mother hastested positive for Epstein-Barr virus. Further blood test results eventually yield the diagnosis. DISCUSSION Multiple things have to be taken into consideration when a patient presents withthese symptoms. Her travel history is important to the timing of presentation. Known diseases that are endemic to South Asia include malaria, dengue, chikungunya, enteric fevers, and leptospirosis, among others. All of these infections can present with fevers, and one thing that can help differentiate them could be the timing of incubation. When thinking of incubation in less than 10 days, we think more of infections such as dengue fever and chikungunya. These can also be accompanied by headaches, rash, myalgia, arthritis, and hemorrhages. Malaria and leptospirosis have an incubation period of days tomonths. The description of the fevers and constitutional symptoms can also be 2Fever, Chills, and Abdominal Pain in a 4-year-old Girl AUTHOR DISCLOSURE Drs Barr\u00f3n Alema\u00f1y and Akarah have disclosed no nancial relationships relevant to this article.

With malaria we can see waxing and waning of fevers, accompanied by myalgia, anemia, nausea, vomiting,diarrhea, and abdominal pain. When there is a known expo- sure to animal urine or contaminated water, leptospirosis is high on the differential diagnosis. Our patient presented with these symptoms at least 3 weeks after returning from travel, which helped us rule out some of these infections. Her peripheral blood smear was negative for malaria, and the preliminary report for the blood culture revealed growth of gram-negative rods. Diagnosis The blood culture 'snal identi cation revealed the organ- ism to be Salmonella typhi. Typhoid fever is not usually seen in the United States given that it is not an endemic area. This case pointed outthat we should always take in to consideration different types of etiologies for persistent fevers, reminding us ofhow important travel history is in all patients and their families. Reviewing more about S typhi, this species has humans as the only host and reservoir, unlike other common typessuch as Salmonella paratyphi, which can infect animals. The transmission is mainly by consumption of contaminatedfood or water and occasionally by direct fecal-oral route. After ingestion and reaching the small intestine, the bacteria penetrate the intestinal mucosa and are ingested by mac- rophages, where they live and multiply. Afterward they reach the mesenteric lymph nodes and reach the bloodstream via the thoracic duct, causing primary bacteremia. The bacte- rium continues seeding and multiplying in the spleen, liver, gall bladder, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. It is here where they reside during the incubation period, whichvaries from 3 to 60 days. After multiplication in large numbers, bacteria spill into the bloodstream, creating the secondary bacteremia, and this prompts the initiation of clinical symptoms. The patient 'sc l i n i c a lm a n i f e s t a t i o n si n c l u d ep e r s i s - tent fevers, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea in children, constipation in adults, headache, malaise, and anorexia. Some cases may present with an exanthema characterized by \"rose spots \"on the chest, abdomen, and back. In more complicated cases, extraintestinal manifes- tations may occur, including melena, intestinal abscesses, intestinal perforation, altered mental status, meningitis, coma, and death. Some patients become chronic carriers of the bacterium, estimated to be approximately 2% to 5% of those who had infection. This is de ned as excretion of the organism in stool or urine for more than 12 months after an acuteinfection. The bacteria persist in the biliary tract aftersymptoms resolve. Typhoid fever is usually treated with a single antibiotic drug, but it depends on how severe the presentation of ill-ness is, whether there are any local resistance patterns, the feasibility of taking oral medications, the clinical setting, and available resources. The usual choices are fluoroquino- lones, with a duration of 7 to 10 days; third-generationcephalosporins, lasting 10 to 14 days; and azithromycin, prescribed for 5 to 7 days. Also used agents are chloram- phenicol (duration, 2 -3 weeks), ampicillin, or trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (duration of both, 10 -14 days); but these are less frequently used given the prevalence of resis-tance. For patients with prolonged fever who require paren- teral therapy, ceftriaxone is recommended as empirical therapy. Usually, defervescence is seen by day 4 or 5 of parenteral treatment. Once symptoms improve and suscep- tibilities have been tested, switching to oral antibiotics is appropriate. The main mechanism of prevention would be avoiding ingestion of water and food in areas of poor sanitation and personal hygiene. There is also an indication for typhoidvaccination in travelers and individuals with a high risk of exposure. At the moment, there are 2 available vaccines: oral live vaccine and Vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine. Neither is completely effective against S typhi; therefore, routine vaccination is not recommended in the United States ac-cording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. Vaccination is recommended for those who are planning to travel to endemic regions, individuals who are in close contact with known carriers, and for those whose work exposes them to S typhi, such as microbiologists and laboratory workers. Patient Course Our patient was admitted for intravenous antibiotic therapyand was started on ceftriaxone, 1 g twice a day. Her fevers and symptoms continued for the rst 4 days of hospitali- zation. By the fth day she started having improvement of symptoms without nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Her fevers also started to subside by day 5. The blood culture sensitivities were also back and demonstrated susceptibilityto trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. After being afebrile for 24 hours, the patient was transitioned to oral antibiotics for a total of 14 days of treatment. Of note, the patient 's mother also tested positive for S typhi on blood culture and was started on oral antibiotics. After discharge, the patient followed up with her pedi- atrician and continued to be afebrile and denied any recur- rent symptoms of diarrhea or vomiting.

Lessons for the Clinician \u0081Consider typhoid fever in patients with persistent fevers and a known travel history to resource-limited countries where these infections are endemic. \u0081Treatment should be started as quickly as possible to avoidsevere complications such as intestinal abscesses, per- foration, meningitis, death secondary to Sal- monella typhi (typhoid fever).\u0081Knowing who is at higher risk to become infected with S typhi is important when discussing vaccination for the patient and/or family members.
