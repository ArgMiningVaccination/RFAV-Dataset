Background information on the procedure 1.1. Submission of the dossier The applicant Novavax CZ, a.s. submitted on 16 November 2021 an application for marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Nuvaxovid , through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 6 November 2020. The applicant applied for the following indication : Nuvaxovid is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by S ARS-CoV-2 in individuals 18 years of age and older. 1.2. Legal basis, dossier content The legal basis for this application refers to: Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non - clinical and clinical data based on applicants' own tests and studies and/or bibliog raphic literature substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 1.3. Information on Paediatric requirements Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0126/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric inv estigation plan (PIP ). At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0126/2021 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred. 1.4. Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 1.4.1. Similarity Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/20 00 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication. 1.5. Applicant's requests for consideration 1.5.1. Conditional marketing authorisation The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 14 -a of the above -mentioned Regulation. as it is intended for the prophylaxis of a life -threatening disease. In addition, the above- mentioned medicinal product is intended for use in an emergency situation, in response to public health threats duly recognised by the W orld Health Organisation and by the Union. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 11/168 1.5.2. New active Substance status The applicant requested the active substance SARS -CoV-2 recombinant spike protein contained in the above medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant c laims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 1.6. Scientific advice The applicant received the following Scientific Advice on the development relevant for the indication subject to the present applic ation: Date Reference SAWP co -ordinators 12 October 2020 EMEA/H/SA/4686/1/2020/III Prof Brigitte Schwarzer -Daum, Dr Mair Powell The Scientific Advice pertained to the following quality/non -clinical/clinical aspects: Comparability exercise to assess production of active substance, Matrix -M1 adjuvant and finished product at additional manufacturing facilities Lot release testing protocol for active substance and f inished product Non-clinical development plan Clinical data package to support a conditional MAA Advice on paediatric vaccine development and timelines Compliance with Scientific Advice Clinical aspects discussed included the acceptability of the proposed clinical development programme to support a potential (c)MA proposing study 2019nCoV -501 as pivotal study, as well as the acceptability of the target of demonstrating a VE of 50% with a lower bound of the 95% CI of >0. This was not accepted as sufficient, indicating the lower bound of the CI should at least be 20% and preferably 30%. Considering the submission is no longer in line with the proposal in the advice (i.e., 2019nCoV -501 is n ot the pivotal study), the following comments were provided in this advice on the clinical development plan which hold relevance: - The safety and immunogenicity data obtained in Part 1 support inclusion of the adjuvant and administration of a second dose, w ith no apparent advantage for 25 vs. 5 g antigen doses in the adjuvanted formulations. - It was advised that the study would have a single primary efficacy endpoint based on prevention of COVID -19 disease of any severity. This was followed. - There was conce rn regarding the definitions for severity of disease. More stringent categorisation was recommended. This has not been followed. - It was found acceptable that the primary analysis is conducted in baseline seronegative subjects and counting cases from day 7 after the second dose. However, it was recommended that only these criteria would be applied as exclusions for the primary analysis population. Analyses of the primary endpoint in other sub- populations should be designated as secondary. Sensitivity analyse s should be planned counting all cases from randomisation, all cases after dose 1 and all cases after dose 2, each of which should be conducted in baseline seronegatives and in the total study population. These analyses have only in part been provided. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 12/168 - Given the nature of this vaccine, it was found acceptable that solicited local and systemic reactogenicity data were collected for 7 days after both doses. 1.7. COVID -19 EMA pandemic Task Force (COVID- ETF) In line with their mandate as per the EMA Emerging Health Threats Plan, the ETF undertook the following activities in the context of this marketing authorisation application: The ETF endorsed the Scientific Advice letter, confirmed eligibility to the rolling review procedure based on the information provided by the applicant and agreed the start of the rolling review procedure.

Scientific discussion 2.1. Problem statement 2.1.1. Disease or condition End of December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed about a cluster of cases of viral pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China. In mid -January 2020 the pathogen causing this atypical pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coro navirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) and genome sequence data were published. Since then, the virus has spread globally and on 30th January 2020 the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and on 11th March 2020 a pandemic. The pandemic is ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to control the outbreak. According to ECDC, histologic findings from the lungs include diffuse alveolar damage similar to lung injury caused by other respiratory viruses, such as MERS -CoV and influenza virus. A distinctive characteristic of SARS -CoV-2 infection is vascular damage, with severe endothelial injury, widespread thrombosis, microangiopathy and angiogenesis. 2.1.2. Epidemiology and risk factors As of 1st March 2021, there have been over 113 million confirmed c ases of SARS -CoV-2 infection globally with approximately 2.5 million deaths resulting from infection and subsequent coronavirus disease (COVID -19). The majority of infections result in asymptomatic or mild disease with full recovery. Underlying health cond itions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, immune compromised status, cancer and obesity are considered risk factors for developing severe COVID -19. Other risk factors include organ transplantation and chromosomal abnormalities. Increasing age is another risk factor for severe disease and death due to COVID -19. European countries that have established surveillance systems in long-term care facilities (LTCF) have reported that 5 -6% of a ll current LTCF residents died of COVID - 19, and that LTCF residents accounted for up to 72% of all COVID -19 related deaths. Individuals with high risk of exposure to SARS -CoV-2 due to occupation include healthcare and frontline workers. 2.1.3. Aetiology and patho genesis SARS- CoV-2 is a positive -sense single- stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. It is enveloped and the virions are 50- 200 nanometres in diameter. Like other coronaviruses, SARS -CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins. The spike protein contains a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase pathogenicity and transmissibility in other viruses. The Spike is responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the membrane of a host cell. The S1 subunit catalyses attachment to the angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor present on cells of the respiratory tract, while the S2 subunit facilitates fusion with the cell membrane . The spike protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine development because it was shown that antibodies directed against it neutralise the virus and it elicits an immune response that prevents infection in animals. It is believed that SARS -CoV-2 has zoonotic origins and it has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses. Its gene sequence was published mid -January 2020 and the virus belongs to the betacoronaviruses. Human -to-human transmission of SARS -CoV-2 was confirmed in January 2020. CHMP asses sment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 16/168 Transm ission occurs primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes and through aerosols. The median incubation period after infection to the development of symptoms is four to five days. Most symptomatic individuals experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all symptomatic individuals will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve. Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste and symptoms may change over time. The major complication of severe COVID -19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) presenting with dyspnoea and acute respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. In addition to respiratory sequelae, severe COVID -19 has been linked to ca rdiovascular sequelae, such as myocardial injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, acute kidney injury often requiring renal replacement therapy, neurological complications such as encephalopathy, and acute ischemic stroke. 2.1.4. Clinical presentat ion and diagnosis The severity of COVID -19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with seve re or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks. Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C -reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID -19 and with a transfer to ICU. The gold standard method of testing for presence of SARS -CoV-2 is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As this test detects RNA but not infectious virus, its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab, a nasal swab or sputum sample. 2.1.5. Management The m anagement of COVID -19 cases has developed during 2020, and includes supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs. Treatment of hospitalised patients encompass anti -inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone and statins, targeted immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants as well as antiviral therapy (e.g. remdesivir), antibodies administered from convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulins. These therapies have shown variable and limited impact on the severity and duration of illness, with different efficacies depending on the stage of illness and manifestations of disease. While care for individuals with COVID -19 has improved with clinical experience, there remains an urgent and unmet medical need for vaccines able to prevent or mitigate COVID -19 infections during the ongoing pandemic. Especially protection of vulnerable groups and mitigating the effects of the pandemic on a population level are desired. Although four vaccines for prevent ion of COVID -19 were authorised recently, there is still an important need for additional vaccines to meet global demands. 2.2. About the product Nuvaxovid (also referred to in this report as NVX -CoV2373) is a vaccine developed for prevention of COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV-2. Nuvaxovid is composed of purified full- length SARS- CoV-2 recombinant spike (S) protein that is stabilised in its prefusion conformation. The addition of the saponin -based Matrix -M adjuvant facilitates activation of the cells of the innate immune system, which enhances the magnitude of the S protein - CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 17/168 specific immune response. The two vaccine components elicit B - and T -cell immune responses to the S protein, including neutralising antibodies, which may contribute to protection against COVID -19. Nuvaxovid is administered intramuscularly as a course of 2 doses of 0.5 mL each. It is recommended to administer the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose. The intended indication for Nuvaxovid is 'for active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS- CoV-2 in individuals 18 years of age and older'. 2.3. Type of Application and aspects on development The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in accordance with Article 14 -a of the above -mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: The benefit -risk balance is positive. According to the applicant, the benefit- risk balance of Nuvaxovid is positive in the active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 disease caused by SARS -CoV-2 virus, in individuals 18 years of age and older. To demonstrate positive benefit -risk balance for this product, the applicant submitted data from non - clinical and clinical studies as well as supportive literature references. The applicant considers that the non -clinical program has demonstrated that Nuvaxovid generates a robust and functional immune response, eliciting neutralising antibodies against SARS -CoV-2, resulting in protective efficacy following live viral challenge across multiple species. No adverse risks have been identified in the non -clinical testing program and the data support the proposed d ose and regimen for human use. The applicant provided results from two pivotal Phase 3 studies, showing that Nuvaxovid prevents PCR-confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 with observed efficacies of ~90%, with comparable efficacies again st non -B.1.1.7 variant strains (96.4%) and variants that were either considered of concern or interest (VOC/VOI) (93.2%) or not considered VOC/VOI (100%) and specifically against the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant (86.3% and 93.6% , in each of the two pivotal stud ies, respectively ). Among Nuvaxovid recipients, there have been no cases of severe disease with an onset from at least 7 days after second vaccination, which mitigates concerns over vaccine -enhanced respiratory disease. The clinical benefit was consistent across all participants. Based on the administration of Nuvaxovid to 30,058 adults, there have been no safety concerns and the safety profile has been largely characterised by mild or moderate reactogenicity reactions of short duration . Based on the totality of the data across the SARS -CoV-2 rS clinical development program, the applicant therefore considers that Nuvaxovid is an effective vaccine with an acceptable safety profile, and that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh its known a nd potential risks. It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. The applicant has provided consolidated quality, non -clinical and clinical data packages for review under the rolling review procedure. For all the finished clinical studies, final study reports have been submitted for assessment; for the ongoing studies, study protocols, interim reports, and/or other data available at the point of granting the Conditional Marketing Authorisation have been provided. As further da ta becomes available, the applicant is committing to submit those without unnecessary delay to complete the Marketing Authorisation. Similarly, all currently available quality data have been provided for assessment. Any quality data not yet available at th e point of granting the Conditional Marketing Authorisation will be provided in accordance with the post- authorisation measures and the list of recommendations and specific obligations. Furthermore, safety of the product will be closely monitored, and upda ted data delivered. The applicant does not anticipate any reason for being unable CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 18/168 to fulfil the agreed post- authorisation measures but commits to notify any delay in its ability to meet the agreed deadlines. Unmet medical needs will be addressed. Based on the serious impact of COVID -19 disease on public health, caused by the spread of SARS -CoV- 2 world -wide, prevention of the disease is being sought through the development and use of effective vaccines. Currently, the following vaccines are authorised in the EU: Comirnaty, Spikevax, COVID -19 Vaccine Janssen and Vaxzevria. The currently authorised vaccine products have all been authorised following demonstration of a positive benefit- risk balance; however, there remains an urgent need to deliver further vaccin e supplies to meet demand in both the European Union and globally. Therefore, there remains an urgent need to supply vaccines for the prevention of COVID -19 disease in the EU/EEA population, as well as to meet global demand for vaccine supplies and obligat ions for vaccine distribution. This includes the supply of vaccines through equal access schemes, such as the COVAX programme, co -led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI), and WHO, which aims to provide global equitable access to COVID -19 vaccines across the globe. The increased vaccine supplies and consequent increased vaccination in EU/EEA, as well as outside of this region will help to decrease the emergence of new varian ts and/or its spread across the world, including the EU/EEA geographical area. The applicant therefore believes that there remains an unmet medical need for Nuvaxovid. The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Clinical evidence to date indicates that Nuvaxovid is effective in preventing COVID -19 disease. Data from various countries with high vaccination rate are showing that vaccination is not only preventing the disease of COVID -19, but also limiting the spread of the virus. The applicant considers that decreasing the number of patients suffering from COVID -19, as well as the spread of the virus, will save thousands of lives as well as have a positive impact o n health care systems, both financially and by increasing capacity and focus on standard care for other diseases. It will have also positive impact on long term mental health, which deteriorated globally during the COVID -19 pandemic period. In addition, pa ndemic measures, depending on their severity, have significant economic impact in EU/EEA and the rest of the world. According to the WHO\u00b4s COVID -19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for 2021, vaccine availability, accessibility, and deployment are t he highest health, social, economic, and political priorities for virtually every country, agency, business and community around the world. The applicant intends Nuvaxovid to be used in prophylactic way to prevent disease or avoid severe cases. Therefore, the benefits to public health of the immediate availability of the product outweigh the risks of further additional data requirement. 2.4. Quality aspects 2.4.1.

Active Substance General Information The active substance (company code NVX -CoV2373) is the protein product of a recombinant SARS - CoV-2 S-gene encoding the 1260 amino acid spike protein (the full length 1273 amino acid protein minus the signal peptide). The SARS -CoV-2 viral envelope consists of multimers of the spike (S) glycoprotein which mediate receptor binding and membrane fusion with the host cell. The S gene was codon optimis ed for expression in Spodoptera frugiperda stabili sed SARS- CoV-2 S genetic sequence. A total of five amino acid changes were introduced, including three in the S1/S2 furin cleavage site (RRAR to QQAQ) and HR1 domain where 2 proline substitutions (2P) were inserted at residues K986P and V987P, respectively. It is stated that these mutations were introduced to stabilis e the protein. The virus strain name is Wuhan -Hu-1 and was collected from the Wuhan seafood market in December 2019. Purified recombinant spike (rS) glycoprotein form s trimers which bind with high affinity to the human angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. The 13 amino acid signal peptide is not present on SARS -CoV-2 rS and thus the rS is 1260 amino acids. The SARS CoV- 2 rS protein has 22 known glycosylation sites which results in a heterogenous glycoprotein with a theoretical molecular weight of 163,997 Da. Manufacture, process controls and characterisation The active substance is manufactured, tested and released at Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. (SIIPL). The facilities involved are Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. Hadapsar, Pune - 411028, India and Serum Tal - Haveli, Pune -412307, Maharashtra, India. The SIIPL site was inspected by MHRA, UK. Evidence of GMP compliance was based on the GMP certificate issued by MHRA. This has been updated in October 2021 based on an assessment of the new facilities to be used for the manufacturing of Nuvaxovid. Description of manufacturing process and process contr ols The SARS- CoV-2 rS Protein active substance is produced in a Sf9 insect cell line by using a recombinant baculovirus system. A comprehensive description of the commercial scale active substance production process performed at SIIPL is provided, comprising details of process inputs and outputs for each upstream and downstream operation unit. The active substance manufacturing process starts with the revival, expansion and production of the Sf9 cells from the working cell bank (WCB) into shake flas ks followed by bioreactor/ fermenter using serum -free cells are infected by baculovirus inoculum (BVI). The spike proteins are expressed on the surface of the Sf9 cells. At the end of the growth phase, the cells are harvested by CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 20/168 centrifug ation followed by extraction using a detergent low pH treatment (4.0 \u00b1 0.1), neutrali sation and clarification by centrifugation (of neutralis ed lysate) followed by depth filtration and 0.2 m filtration. The clarified lysate is subjected to a pur ification process that includes anion exchange chromatography, nanofiltration and affinity chromatography. The affinity chromatography eluate is subjected to concentration and diafiltration using tangential flow filtration (TFF) and final 0.2 m filtration to obtain a purified SARS -CoV-2 rS protein active substance. No reprocessing is allowed. Sanitisation procedures and storage conditions for chromatographic columns are described. Each operation unit / process step is described in sufficient detail; the corresponding operating parameters together with their ranges are indicated. Whilst overall the process is considered adequately controlled, the applicant has committed to explore possibilities to further optimise the manufacturing process with regard to rem oval of impurities (Recommendation 1 ). The batch numbering systems are adequately described. At SIIPL, the intended batch size and expected yield of active substance is stated. The conditions and transport procedures from Hadapsar to Manjari sites are adeq uately described. The recommended storage temperature of SARS -CoV-2 rS Protein active substance is - 60\u00baC. Control of materials Raw materials A listing of the raw materials used in the manufacturing process of the active substance is provided. All the listed raw materials are tested in compliance with their respective monographs. The release specifications of raw materials released based on the supplier certificate of analysis and/or tested with in-house developed specifications are also provided. No ra w materials of animal or human origin are used during the manufacturing process of the active substance. There are three materials of biological origin used in the active substance process, namely Insect Cell Media (yeast), Nutrient feed (soy), and Affinit y Resin The method of preparation of media, buffer, and/or solvents used in the manufacturing process along with their process scale/size, method of sterilisation (0.2 filtration), and storage conditions is presented. Appropriate quality agreements are i n place between the applicant and the supplier of the proprietary media and supplements. The manufacturer utilises certain single use components that have product contact. The consumables are divided into the following categories - flasks, filters, bags/containers, tubing/ancillary component. The list of single use items used is provided. Baculovirus A complete list of raw materials used for the production of the baculovirus vector is presented, including details of the step where it is used, its supplier , source and certificate of analysis. No materials of animal or human origin were used during the manufacturing process of the baculovirus vector or the master virus stock (MVS). Information about the preparation of the recombinant baculovirus vector is provided, comprising information about the source of the genetic sequence, procedures for the generation of the vector, transfection and preparation of primary virus (P1) and pre -master virus stock (PVS, P2). CHMP assessment report The S -protein is a trimeric glycoprotein of 12 73 amino acids. The SARS -CoV-2 S glycoprotein wild type (wt) sequence was downloaded from GenBank sequence nucleotides 21563- 25384. The S gene was optimi sed for high level expression in Sf9 insect cells and biochemically synthesi sed by Gensc ript (Piscataway, NJ, USA). Three mutations (RRAR to QQAQ) were made in the S1/S2 furin site of the full -length wt SARS -CoV-2 S protein along with two additional mutations, K986P and V987P, to stabili se the protein as shown in Figure 3 and Table 1). Figure 1: Full -length Spike Protein Construct 3Q -2P SARS -CoV-2 rS (BV 2373) The wild type SARS -CoV-2 S full length S gene was cloned in the pBacSV40 plasmid with a 5' polyhedron promoter and a 3' SV40 polyA sequence. The virus strain name is Wuhan -Hu-1. The sequence of the glycoprotein gen e was confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. The pBacSV40 plasmid containing wild type SARS -CoV-2 S with the QQAQ and PP sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Information about the function of the individual structural elements of the plasmid is provide d. Table 1. Sequence Change Information from Wild Type for SARS -CoV-2 rS Protein Type of Modifications Modification Point Mutation Lysine 986 Proline 986 Valine 987 SARS -CoV-2 rS gene was transfected into Sf9 cells using a lipid transfection bac ulovirus BV2373. The recombinant baculovirus was plaque- purified. The virus was harvested and filtered through 0.45 um cellulose acetate syringe filters (P0 virus stock). The primary virus (P1) was prepared in Insect medium by infection of Sf9 cells from t he WCB with virus eluted from individual plaques (P0). The P1 virus stock was selected for manufactu ring of the PVS based on the rS protein expression and virus titre results. The stock vials were stored in liquid nitrogen. The PVS (P2) was prepared in Insect medium by infection of Sf9 cells from the WCB with virus from primary virus P1. The PVS was selected for stability testing and for future GMP manufacture of the Master Virus Stock. Data (virus titre, expression of rS protein production) show that recombinant SARS- CoV-2 rS P1 is genetically stable at least up to P6 when virus stock is produced using a specified multiplicity of infection (MOI). The a pplicant committed to determine the sequence for the PVS, MVS, working virus stock (WVS) and the virus in the culture harvest collected from the production bioreactor and send the report and certificates of analysis, as available (Recommendation 4 ). CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 22/168 The virus banking system consists of an MVS and WVS. The MVS is generated from the PVS. WVS is generated from th e MVS and is the material that will be used for manufacture of the baculovirus inoculum (BVI). The MVS may also be used to make BVI. Production of a new WVS will be prepared from the current MVS Batch. The testing program and results for the MVS and WVS ar e presented and is in accordance with the relevant Ph. Eur. monographs. Testing includes controls for mycoplasma/spiroplasma, mycobacterium, adventitious agents (NGS), virus titre, sterility and nucleotide sequence analysis. Future batches of WVS will be manufactured using an identical manufacturing process from the specified MVS. These future batches of WVS will be tested using release and additional characteri sation tests. Analytical methods deployed for the virus stocks are sufficiently described. The t esting program for the MVS and WVS includes a test for adventitious agents by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). NGS was performed to determine if any adventitious agents are present and as a replacement for the Ph. Eur. in vivo and in vitro assays, animal and cell culture assays. The a pplicant was requested to further justify this approach taking into account the Ph. Eur. 2.6.16 requirements as regards the risk assessment and demonstrating/validating that the NGS method enables an unequivocal decision to be made as to whether compliance with the standards of the Ph. Eur. 2.6.16 monograph would be achieved if the official methods were used for the qualification/release of MVS and WVS. Further information has been provided about the (calculated) sensitivity of the NGS method using the number of genomes detected in the NGS study. According to the a pplicant, the level of NGS detection is between < 1 to about 450 TCID 50/mL which is said to be consistent with in vitro limits of detection. However, this does not see m to be consistent with published data of LOD of at least 1 TCID 50 on at least one cell line1. However, the NGS for testing the seed virus is considered acceptable considering that the unprocessed harvest will be tested by the in vitro methods. Furthermor e, the applicant committed to submit the results of the ongoing characteri sation of baculovirus seed virus by in vitro, in vivo and in ovo adventitious agents ' tests January 31, 2022 ( Recommendation 2 ). Also, the a pplicant has committed to update the risk assessment to consider all studies, justifications and technical considerations for the use of NGS testing and to ensure that it reflects the current control strategy and viral clearance study results as part of a post -authorisation commitment. This evalua tion will also include comparison of the in vitro pharmacopeial method to the NGS test method. The risk assessment will be used to drive the analytical control strategy. The complete risk assessment is expected in Q2 2022 ( Recommendation 3). The release testing of the MVS and WVS has been adequately described. The a pplicant has committed to provide a stability testing plan for the MVS and WVS by 1 March 2022 ( Recommendation 5 ). Cell bank Sufficient information is provided about the source history and generation of the Sf9 cell substrate. Sf9 cell banks contain cells from the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera; butterflies and moths). Sf9 cells were derived from cells purchased in 1988 from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) that were adapted to grow in suspension culture in serum -free medium. The preparation of the pre- master cell bank, m aster cell bank (MCB), working cell bank (WCB) and end -of- production cell bank (EOPCB), is described. Beginning with a specified WCB Lot, the cells were manufactured using animal derived component free Insect medium. Prior to this lot, the WCBs were produc ed in Insect medium (containing cholesterol and cod liver oil). Details are provided on the WCB preparation, including media, cell culture conditions/duration, cell passages, freezing conditions 1 Gombold J. et 2014 report EMA/783213/2021 Page 23/168 No materials of human origin were used during the pre- master cell bank or MCB manufacturing processes. Materials of biological origin include the Sf9 insect cells of the pre -MCB. In addition, the Insect cell culture medium also used other specified materials of biological origin for MCB production. The cell bank is extensively tested for identity and absence of adventitious agents which is in accordance with Ph. Eur. monographs and ICH guidelines. Testing of cell banks includes controls for sterility, mycoplasma, mycobacterium, spiroplasma, endotoxin, in vitro adventitious agents, in in vitro assay for bovine virus, karyotype, isoenzyme, Type C particles, retrovirus (reverse transcriptase activity), co -cultivation, product enhanced reverse transcriptase, cell growth, virus replication, PCR assay for detection of specific porcine and bovine viruses. Massively parallel deep sequencing (NGS) was performed on the WCB lot in order to characteri se the Sf9 cells due to reports in the literature of the presence of Rhabdovirus sequences in other Sf9 cells lines using this method. All cell banks have tested negative for viruses, with the exception of the Sf9 Rhabdovirus which is known to be present in Sf9 cells (please refer to adventitious agents section). It was sufficiently justified that additional t ests for cell morphology, contaminating cells and tumorigenicity is not needed. Some further details / confirmation were requested to assure the testing of the cell bank is in compliance with the Ph. Eur. requirements and WHO recommendations. The viral tes ting strategy for the qualification of the cell banks is considered robust using cell culture techniques using appropriate detection cell lines, NGS tests and specific PCR tests for relevant viral contaminants. Overall, the testing is in line with Ph. Eur. testing requirement (and consistent with WHO guidelines). A brief description of the analytical procedures deployed is provided. This is acceptable. Data demonstrate that the MCB has remained stable for 12 years to date. Studies using end- of- production ce lls support the use of the Sf9 cell line for active substance production . The applicant has further clarified and justified the control of maximum passage level during routine production. Control of critical steps and intermediates Critical process parameters (CPPs), in -process controls (IPCs) and critical quality attributes (CQAs) are defined. An assessment of the quality attributes of SARS -CoV-2 rS protein active substance was performed after Phase 3 clinical trials, including the analytical tools available to monitor those attributes and the strategy for using the tools. Evaluation of QAs is based on risk assessment using the principles of Quality by Design (QbD) described in ICH Q8, Q9, Q10 and Q11. In general, relevant QAs are discussed and classified as CQAs. During development of the SARS -CoV-2 rS manufacturing process, a risk assessment was performed to identify process parameters that have the potential to affect product quality or process performance when varied from their set point. Process parameters (inputs) that were identified to impact product quality (based on their potential to impact a CQA) were given a presumptive classification of \"critical\" and were included in the Process Characteri sation plan. Parameter operating ranges were defi ned through process development experimentation and by leveraging platform knowledge gained through respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion (RSV -F) and substance process characteri sations. All proc ess control and performance parameters are listed. If the results for critical process controls are outside of the acceptable ranges or limits, a deviation will be raised and an investigation of the deviation event will be performed, including an assessmen t of any potential impact on product quality. The disposition decision will be determined based on the outcome of the deviation investigation. The following attributes are controlled to maintain the quality and specification of the active substance: control of starting materials viz., use of well- characteri sed Sf9 cell banks baculovirus CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 24/168 stocks/ virus seeds, control of incoming raw materials and components/ consumables, control of design of the manufacturing process and operating process para meters and in -process controls. For each operation unit/step, the set points, normal operating range (NOR), proven acceptable range, and parameter type/classification (non -key process parameter (NKPP), key process parameter process attribute (KP A)) for each process parameter (PP) is indicated together with a range justification. The NORs, PARs, and target set points are established using process characteri sation studies and manufacturing process data. Justification has been provided about the classification of PPs and IPCs. Hold times for BVI and in -process pool materials are sufficient ly supported by process characterisation/validation studies. Based on the hold time study, the proposed hold times for the BVI and intermediates can be considered conservative. Process validation and/or evaluation A stepwise strategy for defining and validating the manufacturing process of the active substance produced at SIIPL through the process life cycle, i.e. stage 1 - process design, stage 2 - process qualific ation, stage 3 - continued process verification following process performance qualification (PPQ) throughout the commercial life cycle of the product). Process characteri sation of active substance was performed in parallel with the PPQ campaign at SIIPL as part of a non -traditional approach to enable rapid deployment of a manufacturing process of commercial production, in response to the current global pandemic. The process validation campaign was performed with the equipment intended for the commercial act ive substance manufacturing process. Two process validation studies were conducted at SIIPL at the commercial scale utilising cell culture medium A and cell culture medium B . Each analytical procedure was selected based on the knowledge acquired through t he combination of characteri sation, manufacturing history, clinical experience and safety and quality requirements. Validation of analytical procedures was performed in accordance with the principles outlined in ICHQ2(R1). Additional supportive studies were performed prior to or concurrent to the PPQ campaign to support process validation. These comprised studies on stability of the Sf9 End of Production Cells, WVS hold time studies, buffer biochemical stability studies, process intermediate bioc hemical stability studies, resin lifetime and re- use studies, residual impurities (including for process -related impurities and residual DNA), viral clearance studies, extractables and leachable risk assessments and filter validation studies. Summaries of these studies are provided. The presented HCP clearance studies showed significant HCP reduction by the active substance purification process. However, the reported HCP values did not represent the absolute HCP values as the applied assay has previously sh own non- specific reactivity and as such was not reliable for absolute quantitation. The assay for HCP is under development. When the suitable assay is qualified, it will be used to demonstrate in -process HCP clearance (Recommendation 17 ). HCP levels were i nvestigated at the active substance level by peptide mapping/mass spectrometry (MS) and SDS -PAGE (please refer to discussion on comparability and characterisation). It is noted that the studies in support of impurity removal capability for other process- related impurities were performed at another specified site which is not part of the MAA . It has been demonstrated that the conclusions reached from these small scale studies confirming satisfactory process removal capacity for process- related impurities are also applicable to the commercial SIIPL process. The a pplicant has committed to submit the pending spiroplasma test results for the Bioreactor CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 25/168 Crude Harvest post -authorisation (Recommendation 6 ). In addition, the a pplicant has committed to provide the PPQ HCP-data when available (Recommendation 7 ) and to submit a protocol describing the resin lifetime verification at full scale ( Recommendation 8 ). Collectively, the PPQ data overall provides scientific evidence that each stage of the active substance manufa cturing process, when executed according to the production batch records, consistently produces an active substance that meets its product specification. Each process performance qualification study met the pre -defined acceptance criteria in the respective study protocol with the results demonstrating a controlled process that is deemed validated. However, to further address the assurance of the impurity profile, the a pplicant has committed to explore possibilities to further optimise the manufacturing proc ess with regard to removal of impurities ( Recommendation 1 ). Demonstration of the process remaining in a state of control will be conducted through continued process verification. Manufacturing process development Extensive information is provided about th e manufacturing process development. The active substance processing steps were developed based on the platform technology that Novavax has used for other vaccine candidates including RSV -F and qNIV. The active substance manufacturing process development is complex and comprises batches produced for clinical studies and qualification of the commercial process. These batches have been produced at multiple sites using different versions of the active substance manufacturing process. A summary of Novavax's m anufacturing lots used in clinical studies is provided. Lots were manufactured in the US at Emergent BioSolutions, Inc (EBSI) and Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies (FDBU). Lots manufactured and their respective use to date are described. Non-Clinical Batches Produced at Novavax The information provided on the non -clinical batches is limited to lot name, date of manufacture, amount produced and estimated purity (SDS -PAGE). However, the active substance process applied for these non -clinical batches was based on the process developed for the RSV vaccine with slight adaptations which are unlikely to impact on the quality profile when compared to the material used for the first clinical studies. With the vast experience gained from the phase 1, 2, and 3 human clinical studies, there seems little merit in requesting further quality related information for the non -clinical batches. Manufacturing Process Changes for Batches Produced at Emergent (EBSI) Changes implemented between batches within the active substance manufacturing campaign for clinical trial supply were assessed to have a low risk of impacting product safety and quality. The changes introduced during the EBSI campaign concerned harvest start criteria, harvest method, increase in cell density target for dilution, changes to the cell lysis step, and a change in virus stock used to infect the production culture from MVS to BVI. Manufacturing Process Changes for Batches Produced at Fujifilm Diosynth (FDBU) The identified changes for the transfer of the manufacturing process from EBSI to FDBU commercial scale were deemed to be low or no risk requiring no mitigation strategy to demonstrate no product quality impact. Changes were introduced at the stage of Sf9 cell culture (upscalin g), BVI preparation, harvesting method, low pH treatment of cell lysate, changes in clarification process, several changes in chromatographic and filtration steps and increase in active substance target concentration. Most CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 26/168 changes were aimed to increase pr oduction capacity and increase of product purity. Changes were also introduced into the control strategy to further assure process robustness. Manufacturing Process Changes for Batches Produced at Serum Institute of India (SIIPL) The process was transferre d to SIIPL. For commercial purposes, SIIPL has scaled -up the active substance process. Additional changes were made to the baculovirus production (scale- up) and infection step (reduced MOI), cell culture media, harvest and clarification procedures and a ch ange to the supplier of an excipien t. Demonstration of comparability In order to demonstrate comparability of the active substance from different manufacturing sites, the applicant established the following approach. Each lot was assessed against the curr ent version of the appropriate lot release protocol for the active substance. All lots had to fall within the lot release acceptance criteria for the site. In addition, characterisation data were compared to characterisation data from at least three active substance PPQ lots. Results from characterisation assays were expected to fall within the specified acceptance criteria to be considered comparable. A direct comparison between EBSI (clinical batches used in clinical studies 2019nCoV -101 (Phase 2 AU/US) and 2019nCoV -302 (Phase 3 UK)) and SIIPL process/product is not available. The applicant's strategy was to demonstrate comparability between EBSI and FDBU (pre -PPQ clinical material used in 2019nCoV (Phase 2 AU/US) and 2019nCoV -301 PPQ and between FDBU PPQ and SIIPL. Indirectly, the comparability between EBSI and SIIPL would then be substantiated. The rationale for this staged approach is that clinical trials in US and Europe were similarly staged i.e. initiate d using EBSI material and then using FDBU material in the US/Mexico Phase 3 trial. Comparability was therefore initially assessed between EBSI clinical material and FDBU clinical material. Active substance comparability studies included both active substan ce batch release tests and additional characterisation tests. A comprehensive set of physico -chemical and biological analytical methods have been applied which cover quality attributes relevant for the demonstration of comparability. Comparability between EBSI and FDBU Multiple changes were introduced during active substance process development, the overall process remains the same across sites. For each change the rationale and risk assessment is provided which are overall considered acceptable. Several changes have been introduced at the upstream and downstream stages which increased product purity. Extensive comparability testing results are provided and discussed in more detail. The number of batches are generally considered sufficient to reach a conclusion on comparability between the materials. In view of the complexity of the active substance, some variability between batches produced at the different sites may be expected. It is noted that some of the differences are indeed intended (increase d purity, different protein and PS80 content). Purity (expressed as %rS and %gp64) is tested by peptide mapping/mass spectrometry (MS) and is considered indicative of an overall hig her gp64 content in the FDBU lots when compared to EBSI lots. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 27/168 According to the applicant, the HCP identification (MS) showed that the predominant impurity for the FDBU lots is gp64 whereas the predominant impurity for the EBSI lots is an Sf9 protein which is also present in FDBU lots at lower levels. However, multiple other bacu lovirus related and other HCPs were detected. As such, the purity cannot be determined only by the percentage of gp64 present. It is noted that both EBSI and FDBU materials were used in the Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials and as such the purity profiles of b oth EBSI and FDBU materials are supported by the safety data obtained and considered to be clinically validated. There are differences in average particle size, size distribution and higher order oligomer content between the EBSI and FDBU materials. Accor ding to the a pplicant, particle size and morphology of the active substance have a moderate impact on efficacy. Active substance particle formation is reversible and dependent on formulation condition s, temperature, and time. The risk of impact on clinical performance is considered to be low as Phase 3 clinical experience is available covering a wide range of particle size and morphology. There is a higher potency trend seen in FDBU lots which could be related to the potency assay (ELISA) applied. While th ere is a higher relative range for the FDBU lots as compared to the EBSI lots using the original binding ELISA, all FDBU lots used in the clinical trial were within the original limits of the ACE2 receptor binding ELISA assay. Comparability between FDBU pr e-PPQ and PPQ Multiple Phase 3 clinical studies were conducted using pre- PPQ active substance material produced at FDBU. The changes introduced between pre- PPQ and PPQ are limited and mainly in the upstream processes. The totality of the data for all of th ese analyses demonstrates overall comparability of the materials manufactured at FDBU prior to PPQ and the materials produced for PPQ. Comparability between FDBU and SIIPL Data from the active substance PPQ lots produced at SIIPL were compared against tho se generated for the FDBU PPQ lots, thereby creating a link back to the clinical trial material. The most notable difference in the results for various lots is the higher potency (as tested by hACE2 receptor binding ELISA) and faster binding kinetics association rates for the SIIPL lots compared to the FDBU lots. According to the a pplicant, the slight increase in active substance potency is not likely to affect the efficacy of the vaccine and needs to be considered in the context of acceptable finished product potency justified by clinical studies and process performance capabilities. The applicant considers that minor differences observed in the k a (association/binding) rate for different active substance lots produced at different sites are m ost likely due to the assay variability and not due to differences in the quality of the active substance. As regards to active substance purity (as measured by peptide mapping/MS taking only protein impurity gp64 into account), the applicant considers that the SIIPL PPQ lots fell well within the range of rS content tested in the clinical studies and that, while lot to lot differences can be seen, on average, the PPQ lots from both FDBU and SIIPL manufacturing sites are considered comparable. When consideri ng all protein impurities, and not only gp64, SIIPL batches do seem more pure than FDBU (and EBSI), both by peptide mapping/MS and SDS -PAGE. The purity data for EBSI batches are not directly comparable with FDBU and SIIPL batches as different methods have been used. EBSI batches are not available anymore for retesting. The FDBU and SIIPL batches have been tested with the SDS - PAGE method that is used for release. The FDBU batches represent a worst -case situation with purity for specified lots. It is conclude d that the SIIPL lots are not considered fully comparable from a quality perspective for potency and binding kinetics when compared with the EBSI/FDBU materials used in the clinical studies. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 28/168 Similarly, it is concluded that the SIIPL active substance batche s have higher purity when compared to active substance batches used in preparation of finished product batches applied in phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies and hence comparability is not demonstrated for this quality attribute. However, these differences can be justified as they are not expected to have an adverse impact on safety or efficacy profiles. According to ICH Q5E, in these circumstances, pre - and post -change product can be considered comparable. This is further supported by the results from cli nical study 2019nCoV -101 (two-part phase 1/2 randomised observer blinded study designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of NVX -CoV2373). Although higher frequencies of local and systemic reactogenicity occurred in participants receiving the highe r antigen dose (25 g) compared to the lower antigen dose (5 g), the safety profile was overall considered acceptable. In this respect, it should be noted that the proposed upper limit for protein content is significantly lower than the 25 g/0.5 mL dose used in the phase 1/2 studies. The particle size distribution ranges overall are comparable, but comparability regarding average particle size is uncertain. This is however not expected to have an impact on safety or efficacy. The applicant has further justified why the trimeric nature of the protein has not been addressed for comparability. The Gen1v2 potency assay specifically measures binding of h ACE2 receptor dimers to protomers within the rS trimers and is considered the key fun ctional assay to ensure proper folding of rS and integrity of the receptor binding domain. Potency testing is included in all analytical comparability studies. Characterisation Structural characteristics of the rS protein have been investigated using diffe rent orthogonal methods. Characterisation studies were performed with EBSI and FDBU active substance. An overview of the batches included in the different characterisation studies has been provided. No SIIPL batches were included in the analysis. However, most of the methods that were used for characterisation were also used for the comparability assessment between FDBU and SIIPL batches. Primary structure : SDS- PAGE showed a main band between 98 and 198 kDa, which was detected by the antibody on Western bl ot and thus confirmed the identity of the rS protein. Peptide mapping with MS revealed the correct primary structure. A longer hydrophobic domain near the C - terminus amino acid 1192 - 1245) was not confirmed by peptide mapping MS, the a pplicant has committed to develop an improved method and provide further data on the C -terminus peptide ( Recommendation 11 ). Furthermore, it was shown that 18 out of 22 glycoform attachment sites were glycosylated with high mannose or pauci structures. was not detected. Oligosaccharide profiling by HPLC -FLD confirmed that the glycoforms were mainly high mannose (Man3F) and pauci -mannose forms. The data presented from three EBSI and three FDBU batches indicates that the EBSI and FDBU batches have slightly different oligosaccharide abundance; the FDBU batches contain more Man3F and Man3 and less Man8 and Man9 than the EBSI batches. The a pplicant has committed to characterise the glycosylation profile for the next 10 batches manufactured at SIIPL and based on the data obtained to present an evaluation on the need for any further monitoring or control of the glycosylation profile ( Recommendation 12 ). The secondary structure was revealed with Far -UV circular dichroism (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The DSC revealed improved thermal stability over the native S -protein. Secondary structure as revealed by Far -UV CD and DSC was comparable between EBSI and FDBU batches. No verification of the secondary structure by confirmation of the expected disulphide bond configuration has been provided. The a pplicant has committed to develop a method to confirm the expected disulfide bonds ( Recommendation 13 ). CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 29/168 Higher order structure was investigated by Size Exclusion Chromatography coupled with in -line UV and Multi-Angle Light (HPSEC -MALS) Fractionation with MALS detection (AF4 -MALS). The active substance is expected to be comprised of rS trimers, dimers of trimers, and other oligomeric forms. This was confirmed by the HPSEC -MALS chromatograms, in which a continuum of oligomeric rS forms was seen and by the AF4 -MALS chromatograms, in which a broad population of large particles was obser ved. Differences in the HPSEC- MALS chromatograms were observed between EBSI and FDBU batches. addition, capillary electrophoresis - sodium dodecyl sulfate (CE -SDS) data and SDS -PAGE data provide information on size heterogeneity of the rS active substan ce. Non -reduced CE -SDS shows, according to the applicant, three major peaks that correspond to molecular weights expected for monomer, dimer, and trimer forms of rS in the vaccine. However, the MW information for CE -SDS has not been verified by the use of protein standards. Based on this an improved CE -SDS method is under development, which is different than the CE -SDS method used during the early stage of development. The a pplicant has committed to develop this CE -SDS method and provide identification of the peaks in the final electropherogram and to include a discussion of the data and final confirmation of the molecular weights ( Recommendation 14 ). Similarly, the HPSEC -MALS method under development is intended to provide a qualitative assessment of the va rious structures present in the active substance and not to address the distribution of monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric forms of rS. The a pplicant has committed to develop the HPSEC method further to normalis e protein concentrations prior to sample injection and to include the use of appropriate molecular weight standards ( Recommendation 15 ). Particle characteristics were investigated by Dynamic light scattering (DLS), Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), Negative -stain transmission electron microscopy (T EM) and Single -particle cryo -EM. The DLS analysis showed that hydrodynamic diameter of rS particles from EBSI batches was smaller than from FDBU batches. EBSI batches were more homogenous, and FDBU batches showed more polydispersity. The TEM analysis demon strated that the active substance particles consist of rS trimers and PS80 micelles that form a complex. The ACE2- receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein faces outward from a core of PS80 molecules with the rS C -terminal hydrophobic transmembran e region facing toward the micelle interior. This arrangement of multiple rS trimers around a PS80 core is referred to as a rosette. With Cryo -EM, intertrimer interactions between rS proteins were observed resulting in higher order spike multimers. A summary of the current knowledge on particle morphology has been provided and the main conclusions made are: 1) The key immunologic component of the active substance is the rS trimer, 2) The particles are dynamic and help to preserve rS in a s oluble state in the active substance , 3) Particle morphology for the active substance, within the manufacturing process variability, is not linked to finished product immunogenicity and therefore not considered to be a CQA . Physico-chemical properties: The development of an MS method for confirmation of MW is ongoing (Recommendation 16 ). Existing data confirming the theoretical extinction coefficient as well as information on protein content w as provided. The biological functionality of the rS protein was c onfirmed by measuring the rS binding to hACE2 receptor by biolayer interferometry ( BLI) and by ELISA, and by a mouse model of immunogenicity to demonstrate the ability of rS to elicit functional and neutralis ing antibodies. BLI revealed a very tight bindin g between the rS protein and the ACE2 receptor. The mouse model of immunogenicity showed that rS protein in EBSI lot DS2 was immunogenic and elicited functional antibodies in mice (anti- S IgG, hACE2 -receptor binding inhibiting antibodies, and neutralis ing antibodies). The mouse immunogenicity method has been revised and several studies using force- degraded rS to evaluate whether this assay is capable of distinguishing sub -potent batches has been conducted. In studies, this mouse immunogenicity model disting uished between intact and degraded samples in mice immuni sed with a low dose of rS with Matrix -M adjuvant in a manner that generally corresponded with the in vitro CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 30/168 potency measures. The mouse immunogenicity test is not intended for use in product release, comparability evaluation, or stability testing and will be used as a research investigational tool. Product -related impurities In forced degradation studies, a decrease in the binding assays (ELISA, BLI and prot ein ELISA) without an effect on particle size (by DLS and HP -SEC) and fragmentation (SDS -PAGE and Western Blot) is observed after exposure to high pH (8.5), whereas after exposure to low pH an effect on the binding assays, and increase in particle size and degradation on SDS -PAGE and Wes tern Blot is observed. Thermal stress also had a significant effect on binding assays, and resulted in an increase in particle size, but without an effect on degradation. Proteolysis had an effect on all assays but less on the protein ELISA, which is a mon omer-specific ELISA, showing that the binding of the monomer was less affected. Oxidation, freeze- thaw and agitation did not affect any of the assays. There is no strong correlation between deamidation or succinimide post -translational modifications and biological activity, and a more general disruption of epitopes in rS protein during thermal stress is likely the cause of decrease in biological activity. The oxidation, deamidation and succinimide variants are considered product -related substances. In summa ry it can be concluded from the forced degradation studies that the binding assays and DLS are stability -indicating assays. Stressed samples were selected for in vivo evaluation to determine the correlation between in vitro and in vivo potency. A good cor relation exists between in vivo and in vitro potency, except for the sample that was degraded by proteolysis. Although in vitro potency was decreased, the fragments were still immunogenic. Regarding fragments, the applicant clarified that low molecular wei ght species (~140 kDa) observed correspond to the theoretical molecular weight of the unglycosylated spike protein and are not considered a fragment. Other low molecular weight species are present in low amounts and therefore not of concern. The low abunda nce of monomeric form of rS has been verified by a monomer -specific ELISA quantitation assay. Process- related impurities On SDS- PAGE the most abundant protein in active substance batches besides the rS protein is the baculovirus (BV) gp64 protein. In addit ion, other LMW bands are visible on high load SDS -PAGE gels. The SDS- PAGE shows that more gp64 is present in FDBU batches than in EBSI batches and in EBSI batches greater quantities of other HCPs and other BV proteins are present than in FDBU batches. For gp64 this was confirmed by (semi -quantitative) Mass Spectrometry. Other residual host cell (Sf9) proteins and baculoviral proteins were evaluated using a proteomics - based HCP -MS method. Relevant HCPs and the abundance in the pre- PPQ and PPQ FDBU batches h ave been identified. Gp64 is the most abundant HCP from BV, and the only other BV protein seen among the top 15 most abundant proteins. There are 5 host cell proteins (Sf9 and BV combined) above a 1% relative signal intensity in all batches investigated. F rom the data presented, it is clear that the gp64 is the most abundant HCP for most batches. However, there are differences from batch to batch in which HCPs are most prevalent when considered relative to the total Sf9 and BV proteins identified. For rele ase, purity is assessed by SDS -PAGE combined with densitometric scanning. No other methods for the estimation of purity and impurities are in place. During the procedure a major objection was raised in relation to limitations of the proposed control of pur ity and the applicant was asked to provide further evidence that SDS -PAGE with densitometric scanning is a sufficiently quantitative and accurate method to control purity. In addition, the applicant was asked to further justify the proposed specification l imit and to develop additional methods for control of purity. In response, the applicant provided additional data and justifications to support the SDS -PAGE method suitability and proposed acceptance limit. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 31/168 The release test for purity is an important test to control on the one hand the amount of rS protein that will be present in the finished product (in combination with total protein), and on the other hand the level of impurities, like HCPs. Only impurities above the limit of quantitation will be in cluded in the overal l purity calculations by SDS -PAGE. Initially there was a concern that several different impurities are present at or below the limit of quantitation, which altogether contribute substantially to the level of impurities, but remain undetected. However, the proposed control of purity using the SDS -PAGE method is considered acceptable, based on the considerations below: An acceptable safety profile has been shown for the FDBU batches tested in clinical studies. These batches are considered worst -case with respect to impurity levels, compared to commercial batches. In addition, five -time higher doses of 25\u00b5g also showed an acceptable safety profile (see manufacturing process development section for further details). The FDBU and SIIPL batches have been tested for purity with the SDS -PAGE method that is used for release. The FDBU batches represent the worst -case situation. Considering the purity levels of the batches used in clinical studies, and the purity levels of SIIPL batches, the specific ation for purity of rS content is acceptable. HCP assessment via MS is currently being evaluated to characteri se the 7 most abundant HCPs (including gp64) observed in the active substance. The applicant committed to implement the method and set preliminar y specification limits already after testing 10 active substance lots (Recommendation 18 ). This test will provide additional control on impurities. A comparison between MS and SDS- PAGE data for both FDBU and SIIPL active substance lots will be provided (Recommendation 22 ). Until the MS method can be implemented, gp64 is controlled through the SDS-PAGE method currently used for active substance release. Justified acceptance criteria are proposed based on the data available. Furthermore, a CE- SDS based purity method and HCP ELISA will be developed ( Recommendation s 14 and 17). Additionally, rS integrity is controlled also by the potency testing. In the presence of the strong adjuvant there is a theoretical concern of immunological molecular mimicry, potential induction of a n immune response against the epitopes on these proteins. To address this theoretical concern, the most abundant HCP / HVP will be screened for an overlap in epitopes with human proteins ( Recommendation 10 ). Considering the additional data and justifications provided and noting the commitments of the applicant to further improve the control of purity and impurities, the major objection raised was considered resolved. Levels of DNA in the active substance batches are low and therefore considered to be acceptable, both for total DNA and for BV DNA and sf9 DNA. It is acceptable that DNA levels at release are controlled by Total DNA using picogreen detection. Infectious baculovirus is controlled at release. The detection limit of the plaque method is acceptable. The active substance contains polysorbate 80 and phosphate buffer and an investigation regarding low endotoxin recovery (LER), including spike -recovery studies will be performed to further confirm absence of endotoxin. ( Recommendation 21 ). Conclusion Overall, sufficient information on the characterisation of the molecule has been provided to support the conditional marketing authorisation. A number of post- authorisation commitments have been agreed with the a pplicant (recommendations) to provide data to further substantiate this conclusion. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 32/168 Specification The active substance specifications include general tests (appearance, pH, PS -80), protein concentration, identity (b y western blot), purity (SDS -PAGE), potency (ELISA), residual DNA and safety tests (endotoxin, bioburden, mycoplasma/spiroplasma, harvest contamination). For release, purity is assessed by SDS -PAGE combined with densitometric scanning. Please refer to the characterisation section for a discussion on the control of purity. The applicant is also recommended to implement a shelf -life specification for purity by SDS -PAGE ( Recommendation 24 ). Upon introduction of the CE- SDS method for purity testing the applica nt should also implement justified acceptance criteria for active substance and finished product release and stability testing ( Recommendation 14) . Identity is controlled by Western Blot, which is considered acceptable. The applicant is recommended to re- evaluate the total protein specification limits when 30 commercial scale lots have been manufactured (Recommendation 23). Potency testing is performed with an ELISA in which the amount of rS protein that binds to the hACE2 receptor, which is coated on the p late, is measured. Potency is established relative to a reference standard. Throughout development, the ELISA assay was improved. Notably, Zwittergent was added to diminish interactions between the trimeric proteins and PS -80 that could influence the poten cy estimation for active substance batches. Active substance batches manufactured at FDBU and at SIIPL have been retested with the improved assay, using the same reference standard and thereby allowing a comparison between the potency results of FDBU and S IIPL batches. The potency of SIIPL batches were higher than the potency of FDBU batches, possibly caused by the higher purity of SIIPL batches. Potency results of batches of both manufacturers have been used to establish the acceptance criteria which is co nsidered acceptable. Contaminant testing is performed at the harvest level by bioburden testing. Adventitious agents testing is performed by cell culture method on 4 cell lines. Analytical methods For compendial methods, the type of procedure is mentioned and reference is made to the Ph. Eur . Non-compendial methods are described in sufficient detail. For all methods acceptable system suitability criteria are provided and the preparation of standards and samples is described. Methods are validated in line w ith ICH Q2 (R1). For some methods additional validation data remain to be submitted ( Recommendation s 19 and 20). Batch analysis Batch analysis data of active substance batches manufactured as SIIPL (n=6) has been provided. The results are within specificat ions and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. Reference materials The Reference Standard which is currently used for the potency assay is an intermediate reference standard. This standard was prepared from representative active substance and was calibrated against active substance used in the Phase 3 clinical studies . This provides a link between the reference standard and clinical study material. A protocol has been provided for the calibration of the new primary and working ref erence standard. After calibration, the new primary reference standard will be bridged against the intermediate reference standard and previous Reference Standard. Please refer to the finished product section for further discussion on this point. Container closure system CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 33/168 Adequate information is provided on the container closure system. The dossier includes references to relevant Ph. Eur. monographs for the primary packaging materials. The active substance is stored in sterile, single -use Flexible Freeze Tha w Bags at - 60 oC. The FFT bag is chosen based on the established historical extractable and leachable data provided by the supplier and additional Novavax studies performed in the context of a previous product development. Extractables and leachables studies have been performed under worst -case conditions, the results being acceptable from a toxicological point of view. The choice of the container/closure is justified, also based on the results of active substance stability studies. It has been sufficient ly demonstrated that the container closure system provides adequate protection from microbial contamination. Stability The proposed shelf life for the active substance is 9 months stored at < -60 oC. Stability studies on an adequate number of active substance batches produced according to the commercial process are on -going and available results were provided. Studies have been performed in accordance with relevant ICH stability guidelines. Two batches of SARS -CoV-2-rS active substance manufactured at FDBU together with 6 batches manufactured by SIIPL were placed on stability. The batches were manufactured according to the proposed commercial process and filled in the proposed commercial container closure system. A description of the stability batches is provided . The primary stability batches are under evaluation at real time (Long term) storage conditions of -60 oC and accelerated conditions (5 oC \u00b1 3 oC). Relevant quality attributes are part of the active substance stability testing protocol, incl uding tests for appearance (colour, clarity, particulates), pH, protein concentration, purity (SDS -PAGE), potency (ELISA) and identity (Western Blot). It is noted that the SIIPL batches placed on stability are additionally tested for PS80 content, total DN A and residual infectious baculovirus. It is questionable whether the latter two can be considered stability indicating. The a pplicant has been requested to introduce a stability test for control of particle size, such as DLS. As the DLS method is currently not validated, the a pplicant has committed to initiate the method development and validation work with a target completion date of Q3 2022. In the meantime, particle size for SIIPL will be monitored in order to establish an appropriate release and shelf -life specification for the z -average particle size (Recommendation 38 ). FDBU active substance lots remain within specification after 9 months when stored at long -term conditions ( -70\u00baC \u00b1 10\u00baC ). No significant changes in purity (SDS -PAGE) are discernible un der these conditions. Limited stability data is available for the PPQ lots produced at the commercial site , SIIPL . Stability testing results are available for FDBU samples stored under accelerated conditions (5\u00b0C \u00b1 5%RH for 1 week ). For SIIPL lots limited data is available for samples stored at 5\u00b0C \u00b1 3\u00b0 C. As concluded in the manufacturing development section, FDBU and SIIPL lots cannot be considered fully comparable as regards to purity and potency. Hence, the FDBU stability data cannot be considered fully supportive until further data is provided. In this respect, it is noted that thermal stress studies are underway and will be used to confirm that th e degradation products and rates are comparable between active substance produced at FDBU and SIIPL. Assays included appearance, pH, SDS-PAGE (purity), Protein (SoloVPE), potency ELISA and DLS ( Recommendation 9 ). In addition, one batch of SAR S-CoV-2 rS active substance will be placed on stability each year. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 34/168 Stability studies will be conducted at -60 oC (long term conditions) for annual testing and under accelerated conditions at 2 -8 oC, if a significant process change is made. The applicant has committed to report any unexpected trends or out of specification results for the on - going stability studies for FDBU and SIIPL lots. Updated stability data for active substance samples stored under long- term and accelerated conditions are aw aited in January 2022 (Recommendation 25). Overall, limited data have to date been provided in support of the proposed 9 months shelf life for active substance when stored at < -60 oC. However, considering the initial data provided and the low temperature proposed for long -term storage it is not expected that the quality of the vaccine will be significantly impacted during storage under these conditions. Therefore, in conclusion, the 9 months shelf life for active substance when stored at < -60 oC is consider ed to be acceptable. 2.4.3. Finished Medicinal Product Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development Description of the product The finished product is a sterile, preservative- free, aqueous buffered dispersion for injection containing the SARS- CoV-2 rS protein as active substance. The active substance is co -formulated with Matrix -M1 adjuvant and presented in a multi -dose vial (minimum 6.1 \u00b1 0.1 mL fill) containing ten doses of 0.5 mL. The formulation buffer contains sodium phosphate heptahydrate and m onohydrate, sodium chloride and polysorbate 80 and additional excipients for the adjuvant are cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, potassium dihydrogen phosphate and potassium chloride. The excipients comply with appropriate compendial standards, except for a few components which are controlled by in -house specifications. The finished product composition is described in Table 2 below . Table 2 Finished product composition Name of Ingredient Function SARS -CoV-2-rS Immunogen / Active ingredient Disodium hydrogen phosphate heptahydrate4 Formulation Buffer Agent Sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate Formulation Buffer Sodium chloride Formulation Buffer Agent - Isotonicity adjuster Polysorbate 80 Formulation Buffer Agent - Stabilizer Sodium hydroxide pH Adjustment Hydrochloric acid pH Adjustment Water for Injections Vehicle Matrix -M Adjuvant2 Fraction -A Adjuvant Fraction -C Adjuvant Cholesterol Formulation Agent Phosphatidylcholine3 Formulation Formulation Buffer Agent Sodium chloride Formulation Buffer Agent Water for Injections Vehicle 1 Nominal Concentration. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 35/168 2 Matrix -M consists of Fraction -A (42.5 micrograms) and Fraction- C (7.5 micrograms) components and the excipients of cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, potassium dihydrogen potassium chloride, disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, sodium chloride , and water for injections. 3 Phosphatidylcholine contains 0.1 - 0.2% -Tocopherol (all -rac--Tocopherol) (according to the specification). 4 There are no Ph. Eur. and BP monographs for Disodium Hydrogen Phosphate Heptahydrate. Disodium hydrogen phosphate heptahydrate referred to as Sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate on supplier CoA. Sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate referred to as Sodium phosphate monohydrate monobasic on supplier CoA. The recommended storage conditions of finished product is 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C and the intended route of administration is intramuscular injection. The finished product is formulated on the basis of the total protein concentration of the active substance and a 5% overage is used to compensate for any potential loss during finished product manufacturing. The vials are filled with a minimum of 6.0 mL to ensure that 10 doses of 0.5 mL can be withdrawn. Novel excipient - adjuvant Matrix -A and Matrix -C contain purified, chromatographic fractions (A and C) of enriched purified bark extract from the tree Quillaja saponaria Molina, as well as cholesterol, from botanical origin, and phosphatidylcholine, from hen's egg yolk. The Matrix -A and Matrix -C adjuvant components, assembled from a specified and controlled batch formula of saponin, cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine, are regularly shaped, uniform and stable complexes (nanoparticles). Matrix -A and Matrix -C are nanoparticles suspende d in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Cholesterol and Phosphatidylcholine are present as excipients in the Matrix solutions. The processes of Fraction isolation and Matrix formulation have been described in sufficient detail. The controls of the materials used for the manufacture of both Matrices are acceptable. The process control strategy is based on a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) risk assessment and is appropriate. The impact of technical transfer and scale -up of Matrix -A and Matrix -C product has been adequately evaluated by comparing analytical data of the matrices produced by processes performed at AGC - Copenhagen, AGC -Seattle and Novavax, Uppsala to analytical data obtained from analysis of Matrix -A and -C produced at a validated smaller scale process at Novavax, Uppsala (used for clinical study material). Characterisation has been conducted with several orthogonal methods for chromatographic profile (RP angle DLS), and structure (TEM). The impurities related to the manufacture of Matrix A and C have been adequately discussed. Forced degradation studies show that Matrix -A and Matrix -C are robust formulations. The control s pecification comprises tests for appearance, identification, concentrations of saponin (SA), cholesterol (CH) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), saponin purity, residual detergent N -Decanoyl -N- methylglucamine, average size, ratio CH/SA, ratio SA/PC , bioburden and endotoxins. A suitable justification has been provided for replacing a haemolytic activity test with the test for cholesterol/saponin ratio. The proposed tests are acceptable. The applicant has committed to revise the specifications when mo re batch data are available and to merge the currently separate release and shelf-life specifications into one single specification (Recommendation 45) . The shelf -life will also be reviewed based on the updated specification and stability data (Recommendat ion 46) . Adequate information has been provided for the reference standards used in the analysis of Matrix -A and Matrix -C. Adequate information on the composition, quality references and control of the two container closure systems for the matrices has be en provided. The applicant is however recommended to update the CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 36/168 control specifications to further align with the Guideline on plastic immediate packaging materials (Recommendation 44) . In view of the conducted initial risk analysis, the gap analysis for th e polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) bottle packaging components and the toxicological evaluation of extractables, the risk of critical presence of leachables in the matrices is considered low. The initiated leachables study is appropriate. The post -authorisation commitment to submit the report of the 2- year leachables study for the PETG bottle is acceptable (Recommendation 42) . In view of the conducted risk assessment and compliance of the contact layer ultra- low density polyethylene (ULDPE) with Ph. Eur. 3.1.5, the risk of presence of critical leachables in the matrices is also considered low for the ULDPE biocontainer bags. The protocol of the verifying study is acceptable (Recommendation 43). The post -authorisation commitment to submit the results of the study is acceptable. The proposed shelf life for Matrix -A and Matrix -C is acceptable based on real time (5\u00b13\u00b0C) stability data from six batches of Matrix -A and three batches of Matrix -C manufactured at Novavax. For the commercial scale batches, 6 months results are available (5\u00b13\u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C/60% RH). Pharmaceutical development The finished product presentation has evolved during clinical development. For the Phase 1/2, Part 1 study, SARS- CoV-2 rS antigen was filled separately and used for bedside m ixing with Matrix -M1 adjuvant prior to administration. All follow up clinical studies were performed using SARS -CoV-2 rS pre-mixed with Matrix -M1 adjuvant. The overall composition of the formulation buffer remained the same throughout the development to th e commercial stage, with only differences in the ratio of monobasic to dibasic sodium -phosphate salts and differences in PS80 grade used. Formulation development started with exploring three different formulations based on other recombinant vaccines and th e most optimal one was selected for further development. Subsequently, variations in the formulation composition were studied with the objective of optimising the selected formulation. Results of these formulation studies indicate that the initial formulation was the optimal formulation for minimising loss in potency and aggregation of the SARS -COV-2 rS antigen. No additional work was done to develop a formulation containing a preservative. This is understandable and acceptable in view of the urgent need fo r Covid -19 vaccines. Exploratory stability studies were subsequently performed to select suitable glass vials of different suppliers. The presented in -use stability studies indicate adequate physico -chemical stability of left- over finished product (after removal of 9 doses) in T ype I glass vials during the proposed 6- hour in-use shelf -life at 2-25 oC. One of the specified vial types will be used for commercial production at SIIPL. The applicant is recommended to conduct further evaluation to confirm whether or not the upper limit of the finished product pH range is relevant for compatibility. ( Recommendation 36) . The applicant provided a study demonstrating that long lasting agitation results in an increase in particle size and particle size distribut ion and causes some damage to the trimer spike proteins. The applicant is recommended to perform a shipping qualification study in order to evaluate the real -world impact of movement/ vibration/ agitation on the quality of the vaccine (Recommendation 26). It is noted from the Applicant's information that Matrix -M1 adjuvant is prone to stability issues (aggregation) in some glass vials due to leaching of silicon and boron. Therefore the a pplicant has provided data to demonstrate that the selected vials are c ompatible with Matrix -M. Differences in glass quality between compatible and incompatible glass vials can be identified by the expansion coefficient of the glass. Manufacturing Process Development Overview Formulated finished product for use in early phas e clinical studies was manufactured at EBSI at a suitably defined batch size . CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 37/168 The finished product batches used in the two pivotal 2019nCoV -301 and 2019nCoV -302 are provided. Two finished product lots manufactured at EBSI were used in the Phase 3 clinical study in the UK. The active substance used for EBSI finished product lots was manufactured by EBSI. Two finished product lots that were used in the clinical Phase 3 studies in US/Mexico have been manufactured at Par Sterile Products (PAR). The manufacturer of active substance for PAR lots was FDBU. The finished product manufacturing process employed at SIIPL was developed based on prior product knowledge and manufacturing technology received from Novavax. The process is conducted in a fill - finish plant, which routinely fills other vaccines (primarily COVID -19 vaccines) into a similar container closure configuration and has also a historical record of aseptic process and practices. The process knowledge and practices are followed at the Manjari site for comm ercial scale manufacture . In order to complete the comparability exercise, an analytical comparability study was completed for the batches manufactured at EBSI and PAR used in the clinical studies. The strategy to demonstrate comparability of finished product manufactured at SIIPL to finished product lots used in the clinical studies is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: Comparability between finished product Manufactured at EBSI and PAR Two lots manufactured at EBSI (material used in the phase 3 UK study) and two lots manufactured at PAR (material used in the phase 3 US/Mexico study) were included in the first comparabi lity study. Besides the origin of the active substance , the major changes in the finished product process between EBSI and PAR include the antigen formulation target concentration , the manufacturing scale , and the vial (single dose versus multidose vials). Analytical methods used for comparability are finished product release tests (appearance, pH, osmolality, total protein, potency by SARS -COV2 -rS binding ELISA Gen1v1, identity by western blot, Matrix -A content, Matrix C content, sterility, endotoxin) and additional characteri sation tests. i.e, cholesterol concentration, phosphatidylcholine concentration, saponin integrity, particle size by dynamic light scattering, negative stain TEM and 2D class averaging, microflow imaging and nanoparticle tracking analy sis. In addition, degradation of finished product lots was evaluated after storage under accelerated conditions. Comparability data indicate that total protein content, estimated spike protein (rS) content and potency of both lots used in the phase 3 UK s tudy are lower than in the lots used in the phase 3 US/Mexico study. These differences can at least partly be explained by the difference in formulation CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 38/168 strategy (total protein + 5% overage for UK study versus total rS protein, calculated by multiplying th e active substance protein concentration and purity, for the US/Mexico study). As both clinical phase 3 studies showed similar results, these differences can be considered clinically qualified. Comparability between finished product manufactured at PAR an d SIIPL The subsequent comparability study assessed comparability of the clinical lots manufactured at PAR with the SIIPL initial development scale lots, development/manufacturing scale PPQ lots and the commercial scale PPQ lots. The SIIPL manufacturing processes at each scale of manufacturing are essentially the same with minimal differences. The assessment compares test results of release tests and additional characteri sation tests, as well as a comparison of results of accelerated stability studies. Th e design of the comparability study is similar to that of the study between finished product manufactured at EBSI and PAR as described above. Because of change of reference preparation and test method, comparability between the potencies of the clinical P AR finished product batches and the SIIPL batches could only be compared indirectly. This was performed in two different ways. Additional details can be found in the specification section below. All data indicate that the SIIPL lots have a higher potency than the PAR clinical lots, which is consistent with the comparability results at the level of the active substance. The increase in potency is not expected to impact clinical outcomes. This is supported by the results of phase 1 / 2 study 2019nCoV - 101. Based on batch release results, results of characterisation tests and the preliminary results of the comparative accelerated stability studies, it is concluded that clinical finished product manufactured by PAR is comparable to finished product prod uced at SIIPL. The applicant is recommended to provide an updated analytical comparability report for finished product manufactured at PAR and SIIPL as additional characterisation and stability data become available (Recommendation 29). Container closure system, microbiological attributes, compatibility The container and closure system for Nuvaxovid finished product is Type I glass vials closed with bromobutyl rubber stoppers and an aluminium seal. The material of constructions of the vial and rubber stopper conform to pharmacopoeial standards. An extraction study has been performed. The applicant is recommended to further provide leachable studies for the finished product in vials and stoppers (Recommendation 27). The vaccine is presented as a non -preserved product in a multi- dose vial. The applicant is proposing a 6 hour in -use shelf -life after the first puncture of the 10 -dose vial, when stored between 2 to 25\u00b0C. Microbial growth studies presented showed no significant increase in growth for all test organ isms during the first 24 hours at 2- 8 oC and at 20 -25 oC, indicating that the formulation does not support rapid microbial growth. However, conditions in clinical practice differ from the controlled conditions during in -use stability studies. Therefore, th e SmPC indicates that from a microbiological point of view, after first needle puncture, the vaccine should be used immediately. If the vaccine is not used immediately, in -use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. A study conduct ed to evaluate the stability of the finished product in syringes shows that the finished product is chemically stable for at least 6 hours at both 2 -8\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C when stored in a polypropylene syringe. The applicant is recommended to provide data of a supp orting short- term stability study that includes both polypropylene and polycarbonate syringes under various potential extended in -use environmental conditions, such as hold temperature, agitation stress that may occur during transportation of syringes and indoor lighting (Recommendation 28). CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 39/168 Manufacture of the product and process controls Finished product is manufactured, tested and released at the SIIPL Manjari site. Batch control testing will be performed Biopharma Leuven, Belgium, Novavax AB, Uppsala, Batch release will be performed by Novavax CZ, Jevany, Czech Republic and Bilthoven Biologicals B.V., Bilthoven, Netherlands. Compliance with GMP has been appropriately documented for all sites. In the initial application , the proposed commercial finished product manufacturing sites included the SIIPL Hadapsar facility and the SIIPL Manjari facility for the commercial process . Subsequently , the applicant indicated that the Hadapsar facility has not yet been established for commercial production. Consequently, commercial finished product production will only be performed at the Manjari facility. The manufacturing process is described in sufficient detail, including the equipment and material s used, formulation calculations, critical and non -critical process parameters with operating ranges/set points and in -process controls. The process is straightforward, i.e., preparation of the formulation buffer, thawing (if applicable) and pooling of the active substance, preparation of Matrix -M adjuvant by mixing Matrix -A and Matrix -C, preparation of the co- formulated final bulk, sterile filtration of the co- formulated bulk to the filling machine (isolator), filling and finishing. Vials are sterilis ed an d depyrogenated in a tunnel at a minimum of 280 oC for NLT 3 mins and the rubber stoppers in an autoclave at 122 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. All critical steps are adequately controlled. A number of in -process controls are proposed for the manufacturing process and these are considered satisfactory. The co -formulated bulk is an intermediate and is tested and released. The applicant is recommended to perform a bulk hold time study and to provide stability data for the intermediate hold time o f not more than 24 hours (Recommendation 31) . PPQ results are presented for batches consecutively manufactured at the Hadapsar facility and PPQ batches consecutively manufactured at the Manjari facility. Results are provided for critical process parameters, routine in -process controls, extended characteri sation of the formulated bulk, batch homogeneity and batch analysis results. The PPQ studies confirm that the full scale commercial process performs effectively and is able to produce a finished product meeting its predetermined controls and acceptance criteria. The applicant is recommended to submit the final process validation report for the commercial scale finished product manufacturing process at the Manjari premises once the results of the l abelled lots (appearance, identity) are in place (Recommendation 30) . In addition, the applicant is recommended to provide a completed investigation of the increased endotoxin level in a specific PPQ batch (Recommendation 32) . This increased endotoxin leve l is close to the specification. As the specification is well below the Ph. Eur . endotoxin safety limit, there is no risk for the patient from this increased endotoxin level. Product specification The finished product specifications (add reference) includes general tests (appearance, pH, osmolality), protein concentration, identity (by western blot), potency (ELISA), content of Matrices A and C, safety tests (endotoxin, bioburden), extractable volume and container closure integrity (CCIT). Since the ration ale and justification for excluding specific quality attributes from the finished product specification was lacking in the application, a number of concerns were raised on the proposed specifications. No test is included for purity and the applicant is rec ommended to establishing a release CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 40/168 and shelf life purity specification for finished product (Recommendation 33). T he absence of tests for subvisible particles, for the haemolytic activity of Matrix -A and Matrix -C, and for saponin integrity have been properly justified. Polysorbate 80 concentration cannot be measured in the finished product for release or stability because of interference in the assay by oleic acid residues originating from the adjuvant. The applicant is recommended to include dynamic light scattering to control the particle size distribution of the finished product, which is mainly determined by the Matrix -A and Matrix -C complexes of the adjuvant (Recommendation 38). The applicant is also recommended to established a two -sided specific ation for osmolality and to re -evaluate the total protein specification limits once 30 finished product batches have been manufactured (Recommendation s 23 and 34). Furthermore, the applicant is recommended to perform the container closure integrity test as described in the US Pharmacopoeia (Recommendation 35 ). The initially proposed lower acceptance criterion for potency was based on the release potency of a clinical batch that was recalculated to the current reference preparation. Because of change of reference preparation and test method, a direct comparison of finished product potencies could not be made. Instead, a conversion factor was used. The recalculation factor could not be accepted as it was based on the Gen1v1 potency assay, which was abandoned b ecause of too potency readouts and replaced with the Gen1v2 potency assay. A major objection was raised requesting an adequate bridging between the two reference preparations to be able to rely on data generated with the old potency assay and reference preparation. In response to the major objection, the applicant increased the lower limit for the finished product potency based on the measured Gen1v2 potency values for the active substance used to manufacture finished product for the US/Mexico Phase 3 study. This approach removes the reliance on the conversion factor and is considered acceptable. The adjusted lower limit is considered justified. Nevertheless, it is still considered essential that the applicant calibrates the old and the new reference st andard against each other in the Gen1v2 potency assay in the presence of Matrix -M1. Once bridged, the finished product release and shelf -life acceptance criteria of the potency assay should be reviewed and updated as appropriate. This data is considered ne cessary to firmly link the potencies of finished product batches used in clinical phase 3 studies and commercial batches and ensure consistent product quality. It is therefore requested as a Specific Obligation ( Specific Obligation 2) . No new impurities / degradation products are formed during the finished product manufacturing process. The applicant has provided a nitrosamine risk evaluation in line with EMA/369136/2020 and EMA Questions and Answers document EMA/409815/2020 for the finished product. Currently identified potential sources of nitrosamines impurities have been adequately addressed by the a pplicant, supporting the conclusion that there is no identified risk or the presence of nitrosamine impurities in Nuvaxovid finished product. Analytical methods For compendial methods, appropriate reference is made to the Ph. Eur . Non-compendial methods are described in sufficient detail. Validation reports were provided for western blotting, potency by ELISA (both Gen1v1 as Gen1v2), Matrix A and Matrix C content by RP -HPLC- UV and qualification reports for the compendial sterility and endotoxin tests, and total protein concentration by CBQCA (3 -(4- carboxybenzoyl)quinoline -2-carboxaldehyde). A validation report for the CQQCA method remains to be submitted ( Recommendation 37 ). Batch analysis Batch analysis results are provided for three batches manufactured at the Hadapsar premises, three PPQ batches manufactured at the Hadapsar Premises, and three commercial scale PPQ batches CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 41/168 manufactured at the Manjari premises according to the commercial process. Batch analysis results comply with the specification and confirm acceptable consistency. Some variability in relation to potency was observed. Referenc e materials The SARS- CoV rS reference standard is used as comparator in the western blot analysis, and as reference standard in the total protein analysis by CBQCA, and relative potency assay by ELISA. The reference standard is prepared from an active subs tance batch. It's preparation and calibration are suitably described (please refer to the active substance section). For the quantitative finished product assays the reference standard is mixed with Matrix -M to mimic the finished product formulation. This approach is acceptable. As discussed above as part of a specific obligation the applicant should calibrate the potencies of both reference standards against each other in the Gen1v2 finished product assay. Stability of the product The proposed shelf-life for the finished product is 9 months at 2 -8\u00b0C. This is supported by long term stability studies for 10 months of a PAR clinical batch, 9 months of a PAR clinical batc h, 3 months of stability data for three PPQ batche s manufactured at SIIPL and one month of stability data for three commercial -scale PPQ batches manufactured at SIIPL. Data from PAR can be considered as representative of commercial product since comparability to the SIIPL lots has been demonstrated. In addition, accelerated studies (25 \u00b1 2\u00b0C) were performed the above mentioned batches and stress studies (40 \u00b1 2\u00b0C) for the PAR clinical batches. Both clinical PAR batches were stored in upright and inverted position and the SIIPL batches in inverted position only. This is acceptable as the inverted position can be considered worst -case. The clinical PAR lots were tested for appearance, pH , osmolality, sterility, potency by ELISA, protein concentration, identity, Matrix A and Matrix C concentration, cholesterol concentration, phosphatidylcholine concentration, saponin integrity and particle size. Commercial lots were tested against the stability specification (appearance, pH, osmolality, sterility, container closure integrity, relative potency, protein concentration, identity). The testing pa nels include appropriate stability - indicating methods. In addition, results of characterisation tests are provided for commercial lots. Testing frequency is appropriate. Clinical batches manufactured at PAR met all specifications up to 10 months , at long term conditions (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). A downward trend in potency is observed, which is not statistically significant. Furthermore, for one clinical batch the protein concentration results at 5, 6, 9 and 10 months are part of an ongoing out of trend investigation. This is also the case for another clinical batch at 6, 7, 8 and 9 months . The investigation is still ongoing. The applicant confirmed that the out of trend of protein concentration is method related and not product related and this is considered acceptabl e. The applicant is nevertheless recommended to provide the full investigation report of the atypical low protein concentration results (Recommendation 40) . The degradation rates for PAR and SIIPL did not show statistically significant differences for the critical quality attributes (pH, osmolality, identity, total protein concentration and potency). The applicant is recommended to update the statistical analysis of long -term stability results as additional data becomes available for on -going stability stud ies for SIIPL and PAR finished product lots CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 42/168 (Recommendation 41 ). The applicant is also recommended to provide a separate stability protocol to describe the post -authorisation stability program (Recommendation 39). A photostability study was performed accor ding to ICH Q1B using finished product manufactured by PAR. It can be concluded that the product should be stored in the original carton in order to protect from light. However, results show that short term (24 and 72 hours) exposure to visible light is not detrimental to product quality. A shelf life of 9 months at 2-8 \u00b0C is accepted based on the supporting data. However, the applicant is required to provide monthly updates for the PPQ lots manufactured at SIIPL using the specified manufacturing process an d three PPQ lots manufactured at SIIPL using the commercial scale manufacturing process. This data is required to achieve a comprehensive data package and ensure consistent product quality during shelf life and is therefore requested as a Specific Obligation ( Specific Obligation 1). Adventitious agents The Nuvaxovid manufacturing process incorporates control measures to prevent contamination and maintain microbial control. These controls include appropriate sourcing, testing and control of raw mater ials, cell and virus banks and in process materials. Each material is assessed for the risks related to the following adventitious agents as appropriate: Microbial contaminants including bacteria, fungi, and mycoplasma/spiroplasma Viral contaminants and encephalopathy/bovine spongiform encephalopathy agents (TSE/BSE) according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) guideline, Note for Guidance on Minimis ing the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products (EMA/410/01 Rev. 3). Controls to ensure freedom from contamination with adventitious agents include: Use of non -animal derived components and raw materials wherever possible Verification of the source and origin of components and raw materials (e.g. geographic, chemical, biological) Testing of virus stocks, virus banks, and cell banks for relevant microbial and viral contaminants Testing of production harvests for the presence of adventitious agents including microbial (including mycoplasma/spiroplasma) and viral agents Incorporation of steps in the manufacturing process demonstrated to remove/inactivate pot ential viral contaminants Evaluation of the raw materials and primary packaging materials for their risk of BSE/TSE contamination. Process controls (e.g. limits on processing time, filtration of buffers and in process solutions, monitoring of bioburden and endotoxin) designed to reduce and control bioburden and endotoxin contamination in the process. A clear tabulated overview of the raw materials of biological origin used in the production process is provided, indicating the stage of manufacture used, sour ce/origin, the risk evaluation performed, and certification of origin (as applicable). Non-viral adventitious agents An adequate control strategy for the control of potential microbial contaminants including bacteria, fungi and mycoplasma/spiroplasma has been developed. This covers starting materials (cell banks, virus stocks), raw materials, process controls, and product specifications. Together with an appropriate CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 43/168 GMP adherence (conformed by GMP inspection outcome) microbial quality of the finished produ ct is sufficiently assured. Based on the presented information, it is agreed that the risk of BSE/TSE contamination of finished product is considered negligible. Viral adventitious agents An adequate control strategy has been developed for the control of potential adventitious (viral) agents' contamination. This comprises starting materials (cell banks), virus stocks, process controls, and product specifications. Sf -Rhabdovirus sequences were identified in the WCB by RT -PCR and confirmed by MPS -Seq dataset s. In addition, low -level positive PCR result for Sf -Rhabdovirus in active substance lots were detected, at or below the level of sensitivity of the assays. This can be expected because most Sf9 cell lines are contaminated by Sf -rhabdovirus and this is not considered to be a concern. Satisfactory clearance of Rhabdovirus was demonstrated in the viral clearance studies. Sf9 cells are known to contain nucleotide sequences that code for reverse transcriptase (RT). Of note, the characteri sation of the cell bank s to date includes a number of studies that were performed to demonstrate that the cell banks are free of infectious retrovirus. According to the a pplicant, despite the fact that RT equivalent to ~1x103 RVLP was detected, there is a low risk of the presenc e of infectious virus for two reasons: the NGS assay was validated and no retrovirus sequences were detected in harvest material and the active substance purification process has been proven to offer at least 13.99 LRV for a model retrovirus (see below vir al clearance studies). RT activity detected at levels below the sensitivity of the assay could be expected as the test item is manufactured from Sf9 cells and the very low level is likely due to non -infectious retrotransposon elements within the Sf9 genome . Viral clearance studies Based on the information on the raw materials of biological origin used in the production process which have a potential to harbour viral contaminants, a robust strategy for virus clearance is needed. Convincing viral clearance st udies were performed in accordance with ICH Q5A. The choice of the identified process steps for virus clearance are considered appropriate. The selection of the model/relevant viruses used in the viral clearance studies are sufficiently justified. Adequat e interference, matrix effects and cytotoxicity studies were performed. The lowest dilution that could be evaluated without significant cytotoxicity or viral interference was assessed. Sufficient information is provided in support of the scale down model, process parameters and study design. Process parameters reflect (worst -case) routine large scale production conditions. Based on the totality of evidence, it is agreed that the risk of viral contamination in Nuvaxovid is low with a sufficient safety margin as regards the risk of (infectious) viral contaminants present in the finished product. Post-approval change management protocol The applicant included a Post -Approval Change Management Protocol (PACMP) to support addition of active substance manufacturing and testing sites to supplement commercial demand. The protocol outlines the information to be submitted to request approval for future active substance manufacturing sites, to supplement manufacture by the currently approved site SIIPL. Future sites will have GMP and MIA certification in place with an appropriate inspection record. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 44/168 The PACMP d efines the required elements to demonstrate overall comparability between the approved site and additional sites to achieve consistency and control of the active substance manufacturing process and product at the new site in comparison to the approved site . A dual approach is implemented to evaluate (1) the active substance manufacturing process via process comparability (i.e. process validation) and (2) active substance product via analytical comparability. The active substance manufacturing process at the new facility will be compared to the active substance manufacturing process at the approved site (SIIPL) to define any potential differences and appropriate mitigation, as applicable. The initial marketing authorisation application included data to demons trate analytical comparability of the active substance produced at SIIPL to material manufactured at FDBU, where pre- PPQ material at FDBU was used to formulate finished product for Phase 3 trials. The active substance at the new facility will be evaluated against the active substance from SIIPL to ensure that the biochemical (purity), biophysical (structural), and biological (potency) properties of the final active substance at the new facility is comparable. As requested, 3 -way comparability for the active substance will be performed, comparing the active substance from the new facility to material both from SIIPL and the clinical manufacturing site FDBU. Upon request during the procedure, the PAMCP was revised and considered generally in line with the EMA Q&A on pos t-approval change management protocols (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/586330/2010). In the initial application three additional PACMPs were included. These related to an additional finished product and adjuvant manufacturing and testing sites and to an alter nate finished product formulation process. Further to concerns raised during the procedure these PACMPs have been withdrawn by the applicant. 2.4.4. Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Quality data to support consistent q uality of Nuvaxovid are considered sufficient in the context of a conditional Marketing Authorisation in the current (COVID -19) pandemic emergency situation. Having considered the emergency situation and the quality documentation provided, the CHMP imposed two specific obligations (SOBs) with clearly defined due dates (refer to Conclusions for details). It is expected that the applicant will be able to provide the requested data and thereby fulfil the specific obligations. Based on the applicant's plans and documentation, it is expected that data to fulfil the SOs will be submitted between February 2022 and end of January 2023. During the procedure, two major objections were raised, in relation to the control of purity and potency. Additional data have been submitted by the applicant during the procedure in response to the major objections and other concerns raised. Further information is provided below on the resolution of the major objections and the rationale for accepting some open issues to be addressed as Specific Obligations post- marketing. Several other issues, 46 in total, are further highlighted as Recommendations (RECs) to be addressed by the applicant post -authorisation . These cover various aspects of the active substance, finished product and adj uvant and are detailed in Annex I to this report. An exemption from Article 51 of Directive 2001/83/EC was sought regarding potency testing of the finished product at Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. (SIIPL), 212/2, Road, Hadapsar, Maharashtra, India. Finished product EU -release potency testing will be performed at SIIPL until 31 st March 2022. From this date onwards, potency testing will be performed by a site located in the EU (either the currently approved release test ing site KBI Biopharma, Technologielaan 8, B -3001 Leuven, Belgium or an additional site which is intended to be added via variation post- approval (Novavax CZ a.s. report EMA/783213/2021 Page 45/168 the ongoing COVID -19 epidemiological situation, the duration of the derogation and that it is acceptable from a quality point of view, this approach was accepted and reflected accordingly in the terms of the Marketing Authorisation (Annex II, Section A of the Product Information). Active Sub stance During the procedure, a number of issues were raised concerning the process development, demonstration of comparability and control of purity. The main points are summarised below. Overall, comparability data provided for the full- scale lots active substance and finished product manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacturing site (SIIPL) Support a conclusion that the commercial product manufactured at SIIPL will be comparable to clinical material. However, the SIIPL active substance cannot be considered to be fully comparable as regards potency (i.e. higher in commercial batches versus clinical batches), binding kinetics and purity when compared to the materials used in the clinical studies. These differences can be justified as they are not ex pected to have an adverse impact on safety or efficacy profiles. This is supported by the results from clinical study 2019nCoV -101 (two-part phase 1/2, randomised, observer -blinded study designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of NVX -CoV2373). A lthough higher frequencies of local and systemic reactogenicity occurred in participants receiving the higher antigen dose (25 g) compared to the lower antigen dose (5 g), the safety profile was still considered acceptable. In this respect, it should be noted that the upper limit for protein content is significantly lower than the 25 g/0.5 mL dose used in phase 1/2 study material. For release, purity is assessed by SDS -PAGE combined with densitometric scanning. No other methods for the estimation of puri ty and impurities are in place. During the procedure a major objection was raised in relation to limitations of the proposed control of purity and the applicant was asked to provide further evidence that SDS -PAGE with densitometric scanning is a sufficient ly quantitative and accurate method to control purity. In addition, the applicant was asked to further justify the proposed specification limit and to develop additional methods for control of purity. In response, the applicant provided additional data and justifications to support the SDS -PAGE method suitability and proposed acceptance limit. Based on the responses provided, the proposed control of purity using the SDS -PAGE method is acceptable, considering that an acceptable safety profile has been shown for the FDBU batches tested in clinical studies and that these batches are considered worst -case with respect to impurity levels, compared to commercial batches. The major objection raised was therefore considered adequately resolved. Several commitments have also been made by the applicant to further improve the control of purity and impurities. A PACMP has been included covering future additions of active substance manufacturing sites, to supplement manufacture by the currently approved site SIIPL. As requested, future comparability exercises for the active substance will include a 3 -way comparison, where active substance from the new facility will be compared to material both from SIIPL a nd from the clinical manufacturing site FDBU. Finished product The finished product is a sterile, preservative- free, aqueous buffered dispersion for injection containing the SARS- CoV-2 rS protein as active substance. The active substance is co -formulated w ith Matrix -M1 adjuvant and presented in a multi -dose vial containing ten doses of 0.5 mL. The potency of the finished product batches used in clinical studies is currently not considered to be fully linked to the potency of the commercially manufactured b atches at SIIPL, raising uncertainty in comparing the potency of commercial finished product batches with those of clinical batches and defining clinically qualified potency limits based on batches used in clinical phase 3 trials. A major objection was therefore raised during the procedure requesting an adequate bridging between the reference preparations used to be able to rely on data generated for the clinical material, using previous versions CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 46/168 of both potency assay and reference preparation. Based on the clarifications provided by the applicant , it can be concluded that the batches manufactured at SIIPL are at least as potent as the least potent batch used in clinical studies. In addition, the lower limit for the product potency specification was increase d, which is considered a conservative approach. However, to further support this conclusion, as a Specific Obligation, the applicant should bridge the relevant reference standard lots (i.e. calibrate reference standards against each other in the Gen1v2 fin ished product assay in the presence of Matrix - M1) to firmly link the potencies of finished product batches used in clinical phase 3 studies to those of commercial batches. Once the references standards are adequately bridged, the finished product release and shelf -life acceptance criteria of the potency assay should be reviewed and updated as appropriate (specific obligation) . The proposed specifications, as demonstrated by the submitted data, are suitable to control product quality. Due to the rapid develo pment, real time stability data for finished product are limited but data from clinical batches are considered representative to support the shelf life of the finished product. As a specific obligation the applicant will provide additional stability data o n commercial batches to further support the shelf life of the product over the entire storage period (specific obligation) . 2.4.5. Conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects The data presented to support consistent quality of the medicinal product Nuvaxovid are considered to be sufficient in the context of a conditional marketing authorisation in the current (COVID -19) pandemic emergency situation. The CHMP has identified specific obligations to address remaining uncertainty in rel ation to quality issues that may have a potential impact on the safe and effective use of the medicinal product, and which therefore are needed to achieve comprehensive pharmaceutical (quality) data and controls for the product. The specific points that ne ed to be addressed in order to fulfil the imposed specific obligations are detailed below. SOB 1: In order to ensure consistent product quality during shelf life, the MAH should provide additional information on stability of the finished product. The MAH should provide additional finished product stability data to confirm the long -term storage period of the finished product manufactured at the Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. (SIIPL). Stability studies updates, including results of characterisation test s, should be provided post -authorisation for three PPQ lots manufactured at SIIPL using the specified manufacturing process and three PPQ lots manufactured at SIIPL using the commercial scale manufacturing process, upon availability of data for 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and completion of the study. Due date: 31 January 2023 with interim, monthly updates beginning February 2022. SOB 2: In order to ensure consistent quality over the product life cycl e, the MAH should adequately bridge the reference standards and review the finished product potency limits when additional data become available. The MAH should bridge reference standard lots (intermediate reference standard and previous reference standard) and the Primary Reference Standard in the SARS -Cov-2 rS binding ELISA Generation 1 Version 2 potency assay in the presence of Matrix -M1 adjuvant, to firmly link the potencies of finished product batches used in clinical phase 3 studies to those of commer cial batches. Once bridged, the finished product release and shelf -life acceptance criteria of the potency assay should be reviewed and updated as appropriate. Due date: 31 July 2022 2.4.6. Recommendations for future quality development In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 47/168 the CHMP recommends additional points for investigation, as listed in Annex I of this document. 2.5. Non-clinical aspects 2.5.1. Introduction The non- clinical program was conducted in conside ration of the appropriate regulatory guidelines for vaccine development. SARSCoV- 2 rS with Matrix -M1 adjuvant vaccine -induced cellular and humoral immune response were assessed across multiple species, including rodents and NHPs. Live virus challenge studies were performed in mice, hamsters, cynomolgus macaques, and rhesus macaques. A standard toxicology program to support vaccine development has been undertaken for SARSCoV -2 rS with Matrix -M1 adjuvant . 2.5.2. Pharmacology 2.5.2.1. Primary pharmacodynamic studies A number of animal species have been used to test the immune response, i.e. mice, baboons, hamsters, cynomolgus monkeys and rhesus macaques Mice Studies in mice (BALB/c) have been cond ucted to optimis e the protein construct based upon the confirmation of the protein and the involvement of an adjuvant. Five studies have been conducted in BALB/c mice . The first study in mice has been conducted to evaluate the following constructs: BV2365 \"3Q\" comprising a full -length S protein with amino acid substitutions in the S1/S2 cleavage domain and construct with deletions in hydrophobic fusion peptide; and a receptor binding domain (RBD) construct received from Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, C alifornia ) representing the intact receptor binding domain of the SARS- CoV2 S protein only. This study has indicated that the mutations 3Q and 3Q-FP806- 815 introd uced in the S protein are insufficient in increasing the immunogenicity of the product. In this prime -boost regimen study i t emerged that the adjuvant/antigen combinations provided better immunogenicity and better protection than the non-adjuvanted antigens. In addition, the Matrix -M1 adjuvant had a dose -sparing effect, with similar immunogenicity seen for 1 and 10 ug antigen adjuvanted with 5 ug Matrix -M1. The enhancing effects of Matrix -M1 adjuvant on antibody production were expected based on the applicant previous experience with th e Matrix -M1 adjuvant from other vaccine programmes (MERS and Ebolavirus), as well as the scientific literature (saponin -based adjuvants, so called ISCOM or im mune -stimulating complex adjuvants, have been used in a large number of vaccine development programmes over the last approx. 40 years). In a second study in BALB/c mice three different constructs have been tested with small mutations in the spike protein to enhance stability and immunogenicity in the presence of Matrix M1 adjuvant. BV2365 and BV2373 were similarly immunogenic by all serology assays performed (anti-S ELISA, hACE2 binding blocking ELISA and neutrali sation of SARS -CoV-2 virus in vitro), while BV2369 was immunogenic as measured by anti -S IgG ELISA but did not induce functional antibodies able to block the spike -ACE2 interaction and neutralis e SARS -CoV-2 in vitro. For this latter reason BV2369 was excluded at this stage. The remaining 2 lead antigens (BV2365 and BV2373 ie SARS -CoV-2 rS) were CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 48/168 tested for protective effect against SARS -CoV-2 challenge, at 10 ug level, with or without 5 ug Matrix - M1 adjuvant, in a prime -boost regime. These 2 antigens gave similar protection again st challenge with SARS- CoV-2 strain . The 2 lead antigens were tested for protective effect against SARS -CoV-2 challenge, at 10 g level, with or without 5 ug Matrix- M1 adjuvant, in a prime -boost regime in sensiti sed for SARS- CoV-2 instil lation of adenovirus vector expressing human ACE2. It was shown that both constructs protect against the bodyweight loss induced by challenging the mice with SARS- CoV2 virus. One of the most sensitive markers for disease appeared to be the body weight which was daily measured as recommended in the WHO Guideline 2014. The effects on body weight loss clearly showed the protective effect of the vaccine, being more effective after two dosages. The more stable 3Q -2P BV2373 construct was chosen to be further developed. In addition, it was shown in this study that adjuvant/antigen combinations provided better immunogenicity and better protection than the non-adjuvanted antigens and that the Matrix -M1 adjuvant was dose -sparing. A third study also tested the SARS- CoV-2 viral challenge in mice pre -treated with an adenovector expressing the hACE2 receptor. The effects on body weight loss clearly showed the protective effect of the vaccine, being more effective after two dosages. Immunogenicity was maximal and protection fully achieved with 10 ug adjuvanted antigen dose, and 1 ug adjuvanted antigen was similarly effective. Furthermore, the vaccination strongly induced adequately levels of functional antibodies against the SARS- CoV2 spike protein as well as the binding to the hACE2 Receptor. Of note, animals with low and suboptimal responses did not show vaccine -associated enhancement of pulmonary pathology. The fourth study in Balb/c mice indicate d the importance of the adjuvant Matrix M1 in increasing the response to SARS -Cov2 spike protein, including stimulation of the cellular immunity. Biomarkers of the cellular immunity such as interferon -gamma as well as germinal centre B cells are strongly in creased by the vaccine -antigen with Matrix M1. This involvement of cellular immunity is important in relation to the duration of the immune response. Based on ELISpot and flow cytometry, the antigen -specific recall response after immuni sation with 10 g no n-adjuvanted antigen was dominated by Th2 cells; in contrast, the antigen -specific recall response after immuni sation with 10 g antigen adjuvanted with 5 g Matrix -M1 was more directed towards Th1. In the fifth study , the applicant compared the Matrix -M1 with Alum as an adjuvant. The Matrix -M1 adjuvant induced a higher immunogenicity with functional antibodies as compared with the Alum adjuvant. On the basis of the studies carried out in mice it was concluded that the 3Q -2P protein is able to induce an ap propriate immune response, which is significantly enhanced by the Matrix -M1 adjuvant. The immune response was not only limited to antibody responses but included also an adequate response in cell -mediated immunity which was Th1-biased . The immune response is dependent on the dose of the antigen rS (3Q -2P protein) in an optimal ration compared to the adjuvant. This ratio might be different in various species as the ratio in NHP is around 1 vs. 10, while in rodents it might be higher 1 vs. 2 or less. The data also show ed that the immune response protect against the morbidity of the challenge, e.g. loss of body weight. The applicant submitted studies to evaluate the mode -of-action of the adjuvant Matrix -M1. These studies have been conducted in BALB/c mice, and one in vitro study has been included. The in vitro study suggests a mechanism of action of Matrix -M1 which is related to active lysosomal processing, indicating that the mode of action of saponins is not related to saponification as such. Accordingly, saponins induce d specific cellular mechanisms. A study with Ebola Glycoprotein clearly showed that the effect of Matrix -M1 was local. Spatial and large temporal separation of the administration of the adjuvant from the protein clearly reduced the adjuvant action. Administration in the same area within a time -slot of 48 hours is crucial in this respect. Cytokines were produced transient ly with a peak CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 49/168 within 24 hours from administration , with the increase in cytokines preceding the increase in an tibody response. Studies in other species Hamsters are susceptible preclinical model for SARS -CoV-2 infection . Following challenge, mild to moderate, transient disease comprising body weight loss, respiratory signs and lethargy is seen, as well as pneumoni a associated with virus replication in upper airways and lung (Mu\u00f1oz -Fontela et al. Nature. 2020 586(7830):509- 515). The study in hamsters supports the choice of the antigen in the vaccine, and the added value of the use of Matrix -M as an adjuvant. This antigen/adjuvant combination induced a strong protective immunogenic response, and a second dose enhanced further the immune response. The administration of the antigen/adjuvant combination also strongly reduced viral replication as shown by a reduced level of genomic as well as sub -genomic viral RNA in oral swabs . Protection from disease was shown by reduced body weight loss and lethargy as well as reduced lung pathology . There was no evidence of vaccine -enhanced disease. A study in middle aged (10 -16 years old) baboons was designed to study the functional immunogenicity by measuring the binding of IgG s to the spike protein and to the hACE2 receptor by ELISA. The adjuvant enhanc ed the immune response towards Th1 , including activity of CD4+ T cells. 1 and 10 g adjuvanted antigen induced similar humoral and functional responses, with 0.1 and 0.01 g antigen levels being sub- optimal (5 g Matrix -M1 for all antigen doses ). A booster injection given after a period of 3 weeks, enhanced further the immunogenicity as measured by anti -S IgG s, functional antibodies against hACE2 receptor, as well as cellular immunity. Total d uration of the study is 245 days. Immunogenicity against SARS -CoV2 was optimal around day 28 -35 after the booster. Afterwards it decreased at day 120 and further at day 182, but less when using the adjuvant . In another pivotal study, c ynomolgus monkeys were immuni sed with full human dose (5 g), or higher antigen dose (25 g) with the same dose of Matrix- M1 adjuvant (50 g). Binding as well as functional antibody responses were induced after the first immunis ation, and protection against lung pathology after SARS- CoV-2 challenge was also seen already after the first immuni sation, indicating that some protection against disease may be present already after a single immuni sation with the vaccine. Nevertheless, binding as well as functional antibody responses increased markedly after the second immuni sation, supporting the 21 day interval prime/boost vaccination regimen used in humans. Furthermore, in the vaccinated animals the viral replication of SARS -CoV2 was reduced in upper and lower respiratory tract. N o evidence of VAERD following exposure to SARS -CoV-2 virus was seen , even in animals which had received suboptimal vaccination regim ens. A pivotal study in rhesus macaques has applied the full human dose of 5 g SARS -CoV-2 rS antigen and 50 g Matrix M1 adjuvant. Immuni sation with one dose resulted in partial protection against viral replication in airways. Providing a second dose resulted in nearly complete protection. All SARS -CoV-2 rS with Matrix -M1 adjuvant vaccination doses and regimens used in this study were immunogenic in rhesus macaques, with the two -dose regimens resulting in the greatest immunogenicity and protection against SARS- CoV-2 challenge that was comparable between both the 5 and 25 g antigen dose levels. IgA response was ge nerated in this animal model. From the studies in hamsters, cynomolgus macaques and rhesus monkeys, it emerged that vaccination with the BV2373 c onstruct in combination with the adjuvant Matrix -M1 leads to a robust immune response that is proven to be effective against the disease symptoms of SARS -CoV-2 infection and in reducing viral replication . CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 50/168 In a second study in Rhesus monkeys two doses (full human dose) of 5 g SARS -CoV-2 rS with 50 g Matrix -M1 adjuvant was well tolerated. The final report will show the results on a challenge with SARS- CoV-2 virus after 6 or 12 months and provide information on the duration of protection. 2.5.2.2. Secondary pharmacodynamic studies No studies on the secondary pharmacodynamics have been performed, which is in accordance with applicable guidelines. 2.5.2.3. Safety pharmacology programme Safety pharmacology studies were not conducted with SARS- CoV-2 rS with Matrix -M1 adjuvant vaccine , which is in line with the recommendation of the WHO Guidelines on Non- clinical Evaluation of Vaccines (2005), also given the availability of supporting non -clinical and clinical data, which indicate d that the vaccine did not affect physiological functions other than those of the immune system. The repeat -dose toxicity study included daily clinical observations, a complete panel of haematology, clinical chemistry, and coagulation evaluations, as well as histopathology evaluation on a full panel of tissues. There was no evidence of toxicity on physiological functions (e .g., central nervous system, cardiovascular, respiratory, or renal functions) based on these evaluations. In addition, multiple repeat -dose toxicity studies have been conducted in rats and rabbits with the Matrix -M1 adjuvant and viral glycoproteins produced in the baculovirus/Sf9 platform with no evidence of overt systemic or organ -specific toxicities identified. 2.5.2.4. Pharmacodynamic drug intera ctions No studies on pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been performed, which is in accordance with applicable guidelines. 2.5.3. Pharmacokinetics WHO guidelines on non -clinical evaluation of vaccines (WHO 2005) and vaccine adjuvants and adjuvanted vaccines (WHO 2013), traditional absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) evaluations are not generally needed for vaccines. The safety concerns associated with vaccines are generally not related to the pharmacokinetics but are related to the poten tial induction of immune response. 2.5.4. Toxicology The non- clinical toxicology program was designed to support development of the SARS -CoV-2 rS vaccine with Matrix -M1 adjuvant and a set of GLP compliant stud ies was submitted by the applicant . A repeat -dose GLP -compliant study with SARS -CoV-2 rS in rabbits was performed, with or without the adjuvant Matrix -M1. In addition, 6 GLP -compliant repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and rabbits with other vaccines in combination with Matrix -M1, or Ma trix-M1 alone, were provided, in which the toxicity of Matrix -M1 was evaluated. 2.5.4.1. Single dose toxicity No single dose toxicity studies were performed by the applicant , which was agreed . CHMP a ssessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 51/168 2.5.4.2. Repeat dose toxicity In the repeated dose toxicity study with SARS -CoV-2 rS in New Zealand White rabbits, animals received 4 intramuscular injections of SARS- CoV-2 rS with or without Matrix -M1. SARS- CoV-2 rS vaccine was administered on day 1, 8, 15, and 36 and induced high anti -S IgG titers. Addition of Matrix -M1 adjuvant sign ificantly enhanced anti -S IgG responses. Vaccine administration affected clinical pathology parameters and histopathology , consistent ly with an immune stimulation following administration of a vaccine, including : minimally to mildly higher mean fibrinogen concentrations, moderately to markedly higher mean CRP and minimally higher mean globulin concentrations. These findings correlated with the microscopic observations of subacute inflammation at the injection sites. The vaccine -related findings were relativ ely mild and no changes were seen in parameters such as body temperature, food consumption or any of the haematological parameters. The observed effects resolved during the recovery interval, except for the injection site reactions . Addition of Matrix -M1 resulted in similar effects. Of note, the dosing schedule used was not in accordance with the proposed clinical schedule (the dose ratio of SARS -CoV-2 rS nanoparticle/Matrix -M1 used is different: 50/50 in the study vs 5/50 in the clinical situation). The s afety of Matrix -M1 was also evaluated in three studies in rabbits, either alone or in combination with other viral glycoproteins manufactured in the baculovirus -Sf9 system. In addition, three other studies (one in rabbits, two in rats) were submitted by the applicant in which the safety of Matrix -M1 was evaluated with or without a vaccine . Overall, consistent results were observed across these studies, and Matrix -M1 adjuvant was well -tolerated with no evidence of toxicity suggestive of any unusual risk or target organ toxicity. The findings were considered consistent with immune system stimulation consequent to administration of an active adjuvant, and comprised : local injection site inflammation, reversible enlargement of the lymph nodes draining the i njection sites (but not elsewhere), and chemical markers of inflammation (i .e., CRP, fibrinogen, and globulin). Most of the findings were fully reversible after 3- to 4-week of recovery periods, although minimal to mild changes at the injection sites and i n regional lymph nodes persisted in some animals. 2.5.4.3. Genotoxicity The adjuvant Matrix -M1 was tested in a bacterial reverse mutation assay and an in vitro screening chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. In both non -GLP assays, the re was no indication for a genotoxic potential of Matrix -M1. The confirmatory GLP -compliant bacterial reverse mutation assay and Mammalian Cell Micronucleus assay in CHO Cells with Matrix -M1 confirmed the absence of any indication for a genotoxic potentia l of Matrix -M1. Further in vivo studies were therefore not considered necessary. 2.5.4.4. Carcinogenicity No carcinogenicity studies have been performed with the SARS -CoV-2 rS vaccine and Matrix -M1 adjuvant in accordance with the WHO Guidelines on Non- clinical Eval uation of Vaccines (2005) and Guidelines on the Non -clinical Evaluation of Vaccine Adjuvants and Adjuvanted Vaccines (2014). 2.5.4.5. Reproductive and developmental toxicity A DART study in rats with SARS- CoV-2 rS + Matrix -M1 or Matrix - M1 alone (administered 27 and 13 days prior to cohabitation and on gestation day (GD) 7 and 15) has been performed. A non -GLP pilot study in rats indicated that SARS -CoV-2 rS adjuvanted with Ma trix-M1 is immunogenic in female and male rats following one and two immunis ations. In the DART study, 5 \u00b5g SARS- CoV-2 + 10 \u00b5g CHMP Page 52/168 Matrix -M1 or 10 \u00b5g Matrix - M1 alone were used, which are in given at a different ratio than in the clinically used dose (altho ugh the dose of SARS -CoV-2 rS is the same, the dose of Matrix -M1 is 5 times lower). No male fertility studies were performed given no adverse observations in male reproductive organs were observed in the GLP repeat -dose toxicology study . The DART study c onfirmed that SARS- CoV-2 rS + Matrix -M1 or Matrix -M1 does not affect reproductive or developmental parameters and no adverse findings on pregnancy/lactation, or development of the embryo/f oetus and offspring through post- natal Day 21 were identified. (although some, incidental, not compound -related f oetal observations were noted in all groups). Furthermore, administration of SARS- CoV-2 rS co -formulated with Matrix -M1 adjuvant induced high anti -S IgG titers in all vaccinated dams. Anti -S IgG antibodies were also found in F1 generation f oetuses and pups (higher levels were observed in pups), confirming the transfer of maternal antibodies in postnatal stages of development, but also (although to a lesser extent) during the gestational period. 2.5.4.6. Local Tolerance The absence of a dedicated local tolerance study for NVX -CoV2373 or Matrix -M1 Alone was endorsed. Local tolerance was evaluated as part of the repeat dose toxicology study in rabbits with SARS -CoV-2 rS Nanoparticle Vaccine with Matrix -M1 Adjuvant or Matrix -M1 Alone as well as in the cynomolgus, rhesus, and baboon NHP pharmacology studies. Overall, administration of both the SARS -CoV-2 rS Nanoparticle Vaccine and the Matrix -M1 adjuvant proved to induce local irritancy and inflammation. These effects can be related to an immunological response towards the administered products at the injection site, which is a desired pharmacological mode of action of the vaccine and the adjuvant. In the repeat dose toxicology study in rabbits, minimal to moderate subacute inflammation were found, which were generally similar between vaccine groups with and without Matrix -M1, and across all phases, and decreased in severity and incidence at the conclusion of the 3- week recovery period. In the two supportive rabbit repeated do se toxicity studies, the injection site reactions were relatively mild after 3 or 4 injections, and after the 28- day recovery period only minimal injection site reactions persisted. In the supportive rat repeated dose toxicity studies, there were minimal t o moderate local effects, including discolo uration, inflammation and haemorrhage at the injection sites, which had markedly to fully decreased in severity after a 3- week recovery period. Overall, the studies raise no concern regarding the local tolerance o f either the SARS -CoV-2 rS Nanoparticle Vaccine or the Matrix -M1 adjuvant. 2.5.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment In accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447100), du e to their nature vaccines and lipids are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. Therefore, environmental risk assessment studies are not provided in this a pplication for Marketing Authorisation, which is considered acceptable. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 53/168 2.5.6. Discus sion on non- clinical aspects The rS antigen is being manufactured in baculoviral cells, which is not a mammalian cell culture, and therefore a different pattern of glycosylation is expected. The paucimannose pattern glycosylation induced by the insect cell s has only limited effects on antibody binding and MHC molecule interactions of most predicted T -cell epitopes on the spike. In general, the pharmacodynamic studies show that SARS -CoV-2 rS plus Matrix M1 induce an immune response in several species (mice, hamsters and monkeys) as shown by the induction of virus- neutrali sing antibodies, as well as by disrupting the binding to the hACE2 receptor. These studies showed also that the addition of Matrix -M1 is necessary to induce a sufficient immune response. Furthermore, it has been shown in a mouse model as well as in hamsters and monkeys that administration of SARS -CoV-2 rS plus Matrix M1 protects against SARS -COV2 infection, as shown by amelioration of body weight loss, protection from activity reduction, accel erated viral clearance, and protection against severe SARS -CoV-2-induced lung histopathological changes compared with placebo . Finally, data show the induction of a Th1 cellular immune response. The nonhuman primate studies are still ongoing. Given the evo lving landscape of the SARS -CoV-2 pandemic and emergent variant strains, as well as considering the global scarcity of non -human primates available for biomedical research, study designs for the two ongoing NHP studies (Studies 702-087 in baboons and 702- 115 in rhesus macaques) have shifted to accommodate investigations into vaccines for SARS -CoV-2 variants of concern. Long -term data for protection against virus challenge in rhesus macaques will be reported after approval . As the Matrix -M1 adjuvant is not currently marketed in a human vaccine in the EU market, Novavax is planning to conduct a biodistribution study in mice to evaluate the Matrix -M1 adjuvant, which may be of value in further understanding the mode of action of the adjuvant. Results of this study will be provided at a later stage . Challenges with the labelling of the Matrix -M1 adjuvant, prevented the study to be conducted earlier . Considering the extensive clinical package available at the time of initial marketing approval, the safety prof ile of the adjuvanted vaccine was considered acceptable without finalis ation of the biodistribution study. Furthermore, the recruitment of immune cells, which might influence biodistribution, is mainly driven by the Matrix -M1 adjuvant (and not the vaccine antigen), as antigen and adjuvant are not bound. However, although the major influence to biodistribution is expected to be driven by the Matrix M1 adjuvant vs virus antigen, Matrix M1 adjuvant and antigen will be pre- mixed and, under these conditions, som e interaction between Matrix -M1 adjuvant and the SARS- CoV-2 rS antigen is likely. The applicant therefore will include an additional study group with Matrix -M1 (labelled) + SARS -CoV-2 rS ( unlabelled) in addition to the Matrix -M1 adjuvant (labelled) only gr oup to assess the impact of antigen on the biodistribution of the adjuvant. This protocol of the biodistribution will indicate that an adequate dose will be supplied, and adequate tissues will be analysed at multiple timepoints, allowing to assess the absorption, distribution and clearance of the adjuvant. Overall, the toxicology programme revealed no effects other than what expected when administering a vaccine. However, the doses used in both the repeated dose toxicity study in rabbits (50/50) and the DART study in rats ( 5/10) are not in line with the absolute human dose (5/50). In both studies, the ratio of antigen/adjuvant is different. In addition, in the DART study, the Matrix -M1 dose is 5 times lower than the clinical dose, whereas the Guidelines on t he non -clinical evaluation of vaccine adjuvants and adjuvanted vaccines clearly indicates that 'the toxicity study should be performed using the highest anticipated human dose (in absolute terms) of the final adjuvanted vaccine'. In addition, the pharmacod ynamic studies in various species have shown that the ratio of antigen/adjuvant may affect the immunogenic response , which indicate s the relevance of the ratio vaccine /adjuvant for the pharmacological properties . According to the applicant , the antigen is not contained within the CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 54/168 saponin -bearing complex, nor are the antigen nanoparticles adsorbed to the Matrix -M1 adjuvant. However, in the intended drug product, Matrix -M1 adjuvant and SARS -CoV-2 rS (BV2373) antigen will be pre- mixed, and under these conditions, some interaction between Matrix -M1 adjuvant and the SARS- CoV-2 rS antigen are expected. Of note , in the mouse study aimed to investigate Temporal and Spatial Effects of Matrix -M1 Adjuvant Administration on Adaptive Immune Responses, with Recombinant Ebola Virus Glycoprotein it was found tha t separate administration of Matrix -M1 and antigen to the same i.m. injection site resulted in lower levels of antigen -specific antibodies compared to pre -mixed Matrix -M1 + antigen . It is noted that in the repeated dose toxicity study with the SARS -CoV-2 rS vaccine, the majority of iliac lymph nodes (79%) was not assessed. According to the applicant this was due to the small size of these lymph nodes. The absence of enlarged lymph nodes implies that the mis sing lymph nodes were most likely normal and therefore the overall interpretation of the study can be accepted. For the evaluation of reproduction toxicology, the applicant has used the rat as animal model . It is noted that placental transfer of antibodies in rabbits is more similar to humans compared to rodents. However, in the DART study, anti- SARS- CoV-2 rS spike IgG and pup serum samples. Titers measured in f oetuses were approximately 8.0% of those present in dams, whereas nursing pups had anti -S lgG levels approximately 70- 82 % of the IgG levels of the dams, indicating that sufficient antibody transfer occurred via placenta and especially lactation. In addition, it is noted that In the DART study, the Matrix- M1 dose is 5 times lower than the absolute human dose. The administered dose was the maximum volume of clinical formulation (used for the early clinical studies) and, although the dose is smaller than the absolute dose that will be administered to humans, it does exceed the human dosage on a weight- adjusted basis by 40 -fold. In addition, the final audited DART report includes data showing that the dose used in this study did induce an immune response. The study design and generated results are therefore consid ered acceptable. 2.5.7. Conclusion on the non- clinical aspects No major non -clinical issues are identified in this application. Several concerns were identified and have been properly addressed by the applicant . The CHMP is of the view that non -clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on appropriate studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity . 2.6. Clinical aspects 2.6.1.

Clinical pharmacology Pharmacokinetics No pharmacokinetics studies have been conducted for NVX -CoV2373. This is because pharmacokinetics studies are generally not needed for vaccines, consistently with current Guidelines on clinical evaluation of vaccines. Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamic profile of vaccines is defined by their immunogenicity, as detailed in the CHMP guideline \"Guideline on Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines\" (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005). Mechanism of action The SARS- CoV-2 rS vaccine with Matrix -M1 adjuvant (also referred to as NVX -CoV2373) is a protein nanoparticle vaccine (SARS -CoV-2 rS) constructed from the full- length, wild- type SARS- CoV-2 S glycoprotein (based on Wuhan -Hu-1 stabilised in its prefusion conformation administered with Matrix -M1 adjuvant, derived from fractionated Quillaja saponins, phosph atidylcholine, and cholesterol. The addition of the saponin -based Matrix -M adjuvant facilitates activation of the cells of the innate immune system, which enhances the magnitude of the S protein - specific immune response. The two vaccine components elicit B - and T -cell immune responses to the S protein, including neutralis ing antibodies, which may contribute to protection against COVID -19. To date, there is no established correlate of protection for COVID -19. Primary and Secondary pharmacology The bioanalytical methods used to support the clinical development of NVX -CoV2373 were a micro - neutralisation (MN) assay neutralising ant in CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 57/168 human serum, an ELISA for the determination of specific IgG antibodies against S protein or N protein in human serum, an intracellular cytokine staining assay, and the inh ibition titre in human serum for inhibiting the binding of SARS -CoV-2 S protein to the hACE2 receptor. The microneutrali sation, anti- S protein binding IgG, and hACE2 receptor binding inhibition assays were all based on the original Wuhan strain. All assay s used to determine immunogenicity in the phase 3 studies were validated. The following table provides an overview of the different SARS -CoV-2 PCR assays used in the clinical studies and their validation status. SARS -CoV-2 PCR Assay by clinical study Phase 1 2019nCoV - 101, Part 1 Phase 2 2019nCoV - 101, Part 2 Phase 2 2019nCoV -501 Phase 3 2019nCoV Qualified Qualified Validated Validated Validated Immunogenicity results The immunogenicity data available so far were generated from study 2019nCoV -101 part 1 and 2, 2019nCoV -301, 2019nCoV -302, and 2019nCoV -501. Main findings are described below. Dose finding studies: 2019nCoV-101 Part 1 and Part 2 Study 2019nCoV -101 is a two -part phase 1/2 randomised observer blinded study designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of NVX -CoV2373. Part 1 is the first -in-human trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of SARS -CoV-2 rS with or without Matrix -M1 adjuvant in healthy adult participants 18 to 59 years of age at 2 sites in Australia. Part 2 commenced after positive results were observed following a formal analysis of the primary endpoints in Part 1 and was designed to evaluate the safety and im munogenicity of SARS -CoV-2 rS with Matrix -M1 adjuvant in healthy adult participants 18 to 84 years of age at multiple sites in the USA and Australia. Both Part 1 and Part 2 evaluated 2 dose levels of SARS -CoV-2 rS (5 g and 25 g), which were based on the results of non -clinical studies with this antigen and on the results of clinical studies with other Novavax -based nanoparticle vaccines. Both parts also evaluated a single dose level of Matrix -M1 adjuvant (50 g), based on previous clinical experience wit h Matrix -M1 adjuvant. Subjects in Part 1 received either 1 or 2 doses of either 5 or 25 \u00b5g rS with or without 50 \u00b5g Matrix -M1 adjuvant (see Table 4). CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 58/168 Table 4. Trial Design for Protocol 2019nCoV -101 (Part 1) Anti-S IgG was measured at Days 0 (baseline), 7, 21, 35, 49, 105, and 189 using a qualified IgG ELISA (Novavax Clinical Immunology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves showing the responses at D0, D21 (21 days post dose 1), D35 (14 days post dose 2) and D189 (6 months post dose 1) are presented below in Figure 6. Neutralising antibody responses showed a similar pattern. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 59/168 Vaccine Group TRT A B TRT C TRT 0/0 50/50 50/50 50/0 Figure 3 - Reverse Cumulative Distribution Function of Serum IgG Antibody Levels at Baseline and Following First Vaccination of SARS -CoV-2 rS with or without Matrix -M1 Adjuvant in Healthy Adult Participants 18 to 59 Years of Age (P er Protocol (PP) Analysis Set) In conclusion, Part 1 showed that up to 2 doses of 5 g and 25 g SARS -CoV-2 rS with or without 50 - g Matrix -M1 adjuvant, administered 21 days apart, were immunogenic and well tolerated in healthy adult participants 18 to 59 years of age (see safety section for more details). Part 2 of the study was conducted in healthy males or nonpregnant females 18 to 84 years of age, inclusive, to further identify the optimal dose across age strata based on immune response (IgG antibody to SARS -CoV-2 rS) at Day 35 and whether baseline immune status has an impact. The following treatment groups were included: Table 5 Trial Design for Protocol 2019nCoV-101 Phase 2 (Part 2) Immunogenicity assessments comprised serum anti -S protein binding IgG, hACE2 receptor binding sing antibodies, and cell -mediated immunity . Neutralising antibody responses comparing the 18 to 59 years stratum and the 60 to 84 years stratum are shown below. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 60/168 Table 6. Comparison of Neutrali sing Antibodies Specific for SARS -CoV-2 Wild -Type Virus Following Vaccination with SARS -CoV-2 rS and Matrix -M1 Adjuvant Regardless of Baseline Serostatus in Participants 18 to 59 Years of Age and 60 to 84 Years of Age (PP Analysis Set2019nCoV-101 Part 2) Overall, it can be concluded that the interim results obtained in Part 2 provide further support for the inclusion of the adjuvant and administration of a second dose, with again no apparent advantage for 25 vs. 5 g antigen doses in the adjuvanted formula tions. The humoral immune response analyses by age subgroup show a potent response in both age groups, although the magnitude of the response was consistently lower in the older age stratum. The final clinical study report (CSR) should be made available as soon as possible to further evaluate the effect of age on the kinetics, amplitude or durability of vaccine -induced immune responses. Main studies 2019nCoV-301 Study 2019nCoV -301 is an ongoing Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, observer -blinded, placebo - controlled study in participants 18 years of age and older in United States and Mexico. Upon enrolment, participants were stratified by age (18 to 64 years and 65 years) and assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive Nuvaxovid or placebo. The main immunogenicity related endpoints were the analysis of antibodies binding to the SARS -CoV-2 S protein by ELISA, and SARS- CoV-2 neutrali sation, both at Day 0 (baseline) and Day 35 (14 days after second study vaccination). Demographics and baseline character istics of participants in the PP -IMM Analysis Set were well balanced between the NVX -CoV2373 and placebo groups. Median age (range) was 65.0 years (18 to 95 years), with approximately 50% of participants 65 years of age. Approximately half the participan ts were male (50.1%), while the majority (79.1%) was White, not of Hispanic or Latino origin (80.7%), and located in the United States (93.0%). Black or African Americans (9.9%), American Indians or Alaska Natives (6.2%), and Asians (3.3%) were well represented. The majority of participants were overweight or obese (74.3%), with more than a third being obese (38.2%). At 2 weeks following second vaccination (Day 35), serum IgG antibody geometric mean ELISA units (GMEUs) in the NVX -CoV2373 group were markedly increased relative to placebo across all age groups (48,918.0 vs 128.0, respectively, for participants 18 years of age; 63,890.4 vs 121.9 for participants 18 to < 65 years of age; and 37,594.3 vs 134.1 for participants 65 years of age) with no evidenc e of CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 61/168 the NVX -CoV2373 group were approximately 1.7- fold higher in the younger age cohort (18 to <65 years) than in the older age cohort (65 years). SCRs in the NVX -CoV2373 groups also were markedly increased relat ive to placebo across all age groups (97.3% vs 4.5% for participants 18 years of age; 98.0% vs 3.7% for participants 18 to < 65 years of age; and 96.6% vs 5.3% for participants 65 years of age). Serum anti -S IgG levels at Day 35 in both serologically negative and serologically positive adult participants were increased relative to placebo and showed similar patterns of response, with higher levels in the placebo group in serologically positive adu lt participants. In baseline seropositive individuals, GMTs at baseline were 7,541.0 and 3,062.2 EU/mL in the placebo and NVX -CoV2373 group, compared to 6,174.6 and 119,620.4 EU/mL at Day 35. Neutralis ing antibody levels in serologically negative adult par ticipants at Day 35 (Table 13 ) were increased relative to placebo across all age groups: 18 years of age, 18 to <65 years, and 65 years of age. Table 7. Summary on neutrali sing antibodies for SARS -COV-2 wild -type virus at day 0 (baseline) and day 35 (14 days after second vaccination) in serologically negative participants by age groups (PP -IMM analysis set). At 2 weeks following second vaccination in most participants (Day 35), neutralis ing antibody GMTs in the NVX-CoV2373 group were markedly increased relative to placebo for all participants (1,156.6 vs 11.8, respectively); for serologically positive participants (3,741.9 vs 190.3) relative to placebo; and for serologically negative participants (1,078.2 vs 10.7), with no evidence of placebo response ( Table 14). Neutrali sing antibody GMTs in the NVXCoV2373 group were approximately 3.5- fold higher in the serologically positive cohort than in the serologically negative cohort. SCRs in the NVX -CoV2373 group also wer e markedly increased relative to placebo across all baseline serostatus groups (95.5% vs 2.3% for serologically negative positive participants).

Summary of neutrali sing antibodies for SARS -COV-2 wild type virus at day 0 (baseline) and day 35 (14 days after second vaccination) in adult participants by baseline status (PP -IMM-2 Analysis set) 2019nCoV-302 Study 2019nCoV -302 is an ongoing Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, observer -blinded, placebo - controlled study in participants 18 to 84 years of age in the United Kingdom. Upon enrolment, participants were stratified by age (18 to 64 years; 65 to 84 years) to receive Nuvaxovid or placebo. The main immunogenicity related endpoints were the analysis of antibodies binding to the SARS -CoV-2 S protein by ELISA, and SARS- CoV-2 neutrali sation, both at Day 0 (baseline) and Day 35 (14 days after second study vaccination). At 2 weeks following second vaccination in all participants (Day 35), serum anti -S IgG GMTs in the NVX-CoV2373 group were markedly increased approximately 350- to 400 -fold relative to placebo across all age groups (44,673.8 vs 113.2 EU/ mL, respectively, for participants 18 to 84 years of age; 47,564.3 vs 113.5 EU/mL for participants 18 to 64 years of age; and 37,892.8 vs 112.3 EU/mL for participants 65 to 84 years of age) with no evidence of placebo response. Serum anti -S IgG GMTs in the NVX-CoV2373 group were approximately 1.3- fold higher in the younger age cohort (18 to 64 years) than in the older age cohort (65 to 84 years). SCRs in the NVX -CoV2373 groups also were markedly increased relative to placebo across all age groups (99.0% vs 0.7% for participants 18 to 84 years of age; 99.0% vs 1.0% for participants 18 to 64 years of age; and 99.1% vs 0% for participants 65 to 84 years of age). Serum anti -S IgG levels at Day 35 in both serologically negative and serologically positive adult participants were increased relative to placebo and showed similar patterns of response, with higher levels in the placebo group in serologically positive adult participants. In baseline seropositive individuals, GMTs at baseline were 1771.7 and 1698.8 EU/mL in the placebo and NVX -CoV2373 group, compared to 1756.9 and 125489.8 EU/mL 35. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 63/168 Neutralis ing antibody levels in serologically negative adult participants at Day 35 were increased relative to placebo across all age groups: 18 to 84 years, 18 to 64 y ears, and 65 to 84 years (Table 15).

Summary of Neutrali sing Antibodies at Day 0 (Baseline) and Day 35 (14 Days after Second Vaccination) in Serologically Negative Adult Participants by Age Group (PP -IMM Neutrali sation Assay Subset, 2019nCoV-302) At 2 second vaccination (Day 35), neutralis ing antibody GMTs in the NVX -CoV2373 group were markedly increased approximately 110- fold relative to placebo for serologically negative participants (1,129.5 vs 10.4); and approximately 70- fold for serologically positive participants (4,373.8 vs 62.0) with no evidence of placebo response (Table 16 ). Neutrali sing antibody GMTs in the NVXCoV2373 group were approximately 3.9- fold higher in the serologically positive cohort than in the serologically negative cohort. SCRs in the NVX -CoV2373 group also were markedly increased relative to placebo across baseline serostatus groups (98.2% vs 0.8% for serologically negative participants; vs for erologically positive participants).

The objective of the substudy was to ev aluate the safety and immunogenicity of SARS -CoV-2 rS with Matrix -M1 adjuvant in the initial set of vaccinations when co- administered with a n authorised seasonal influenza vaccine. The endpoint was Analysis of the safety and immunogenicity of SARS -CoV-2 rS with Matrix -M1 adjuvant when co -administered with seasonal influenza vaccine in a subset population . An unadjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Flucelvax, Seqirus) was given to those 18 to 64 years of age, and an adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccin e (Fluad, Seqirus) was given to those 65 years of age, in compliance with UK recommendations. Flucelvax contains surface antigens (hemagglutinin and neuraminidase) detergent -extracted from the 4 strains of influenza virus recommended annually by the WHO for the Northern Hemisphere season (type A H1N1, type A H3N2, type B Yamagata lineage and type B Victoria lineage; 15 ug virus protein of each, 60 ug virus protein in total). Fluad contains surface antigens (hemagglutinin and neuraminidase) detergent -extracted from type A H1N1, type A H3N2 and type B Victoria virus, adjuvanted with MF59 (oil -in-water emulsion of squalene, a metaboli sable oil). is in the EU but the trivalent Fluad is not; however, in the EU, a tetravalent version of Fluad is available. The results are shown in the following two tables for the Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay and the Serum Anti -Spike Protein Binding IgG Specific to SARS -CoV-2 rS Protein Antigen Assay, respectively.

Summary of Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay by Influenza Virus Strain at Day 0 and Day 21 in Adult Participants Who Were Co -Administered QIVc and aTIV at Day 0 by Age HAI Serology Subset) CHMP assessment report 12 Summary of Serum Anti -S IgG Levels at Day 0 (Baseline) and Day 35 (14 Days after Second Vaccination) in Serologically Negative Adult Participants Who Were Co - Administered QIVc and aTIV at Day 0 by Age Group (PP -IMM Anti -S Protein enza Vaccine Substudy) Co-administration resulted in no change to influenza vaccine immune responses as measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay. A 30% reduction in antibody responses to Nuvaxovid was noted as assessed by an anti -spike IgG assay with seroconversion rates similar to participants who did not receive concomitant influenza vaccine. The clinical impact of the reduced response is unknown. 2019nCoV-501 2019nCoV -501 is an ongoing Phase 2a/b, multicentre, randomised, observer -blinded, placebo - controlled study in HIV-negative participants 18 to 84 years of age and people living with HIV 18 to 64 years of age in South Africa. These people were medically stable (free of opportunistic infections), receiving highly active and stable antiretroviral therapy, and having an HIV-1 viral load of < 1000 copies/mL. Upon enrolment, participants were randomly assigned to receive Nuvaxovid or placebo. Immunogenicity related endpoints considered binding antibody levels and n eutralis ing antibody activity at Day 0, 21 (only for binding antibodies) and 35 in healthy HIV -negative and medically stable HIV - positive adult subjects with baseline negative serosta tus, baseline positive serostatus, or regardless of baseline serostatus. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 67/168 Regardless of HIV status, anti -S IgG antibody GMTs at Day 0 were higher for participants who were seropositive at baseline, across both vaccine and placebo groups, than they were for participants who were seronegative at baseline. In all participants (HIV seronegative and HIV seropositive subjects together), SARS -CoV-2 seronegative at baseline, the anti -S IgG antibody GMT at Day 21 was greater for participants who received NVX -CoV2373 (1,147.4 EU/mL) than it was for those who received placebo (119.2 EU/mL). The anti -S IgG antibody GMT further increased after the second dose, to 30520.6 and 126.0 EU/mL at Day 35. Among participants who were SARS -CoV-2 seronegative at baseline, anti -S IgG antibody GMTs for HIV-positive participants were approximately half of those seen for HIV -negative participants (14420.5 vs 31631.8 EU/mL at Day 35); however, among participants who were SARS -CoV-2 seropositive at baseline, anti -S IgG antibody GMTs for HIV-positive participants were comparable to those seen for HIV-negative participants (98399.5 vs 100666.1 EU/mL at Day 35). In all participants, regardless of baseline serostatus and regardless of HIV status, participants who received 2 doses of NVX -CoV2373 showed stronger neutrali sing antibody responses, in terms of amplitude and kinetics, than did those that received placebo. Also in this study , among participants who were SARS -CoV-2 seropositive at baseline, neutralis ing antibody GMTs for HIV -positive participants were comparable to those seen for HIV -negative participants. Regardless of HIV status, SARS- CoV-2 wild -type virus neutralis ing antibody GMTs at Day 35 were markedly higher in seropositive as compared to seronegative participants. SCRs at Day 35 ranged from 92.3% to 98.4% for NVX- CoV2373 versus 2.0% to 13.5% for placebo for all actively immuni sed participants and for HIV-negative and HIV -positive participants with baseline negative serostatus, baseline positive serostatus, or regardless of base line serostatus. See Table 19 below for more details per HIV serostatus group.

Discussion on clinical pharmacology In the context of v accines, PK studies are not required because the PK is not considered informative towards the determination of an optimal dose and the metabolic pathways of vaccines are generally understood. The applicant has performed several assays to characterise the vaccine -induced immune response. At the present time, there is no established immunological correlate of protection against SARS -CoV-2 infection . Current evidence suggests that neutrali sing antibody against the spike protein of SARS -CoV- 2 is likely to be the best surrogate marker for vaccine efficacy. Validation reports have been submitted for the main assays, including the SARS -CoV-2 microneutralis ation (MN) assay and the IgG ELISA. The T cell assays have not yet been validated. If these assays will be used for the analysis of phase 3 study samples, validation reports are expected to be available. Of note, the validation exercise should include all steps, i.e. also the preparation, freezing and shipping of vaccinee PBMCs, and bridging studies between US an d UK laboratories. For both the MN and IgG ELISA assays efforts have been put in calibrating the assay standards with the WHO international standard (IS). For the S -binding ELISA, the conversion factor to convert IgG antibody level from EU/mL to BAU/mL is calculated to be 22. As such, any antibody level depicted in ELISA units can be divided by 22 to express these in the WHO international units BAU/mL. For the MN assay, a conversion factor of 0.62 has been determined. Immunogenicity data available were ge nerated from study 2019nCoV -101 part 1 and 2 (dose response studies), 2019nCoV -301 ). Immunogenicity was assessed primarily based on circulating neutrali sing and spike antigen -binding antibodies as measured by in vitro SARS -CoV-2 neutrali sation assay and anti -S protein respectively . Results from an hACE2 receptor binding inhibition ELISA and a limited amount of T cell immunity data were also included in the interim report of study 2019nCoV -101. The clinical phase 1/2 immunogenicity findings were in concordance with the preclinical immunogenicity findings in mice, CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 69/168 hamsters and nonhuman primate models; both preclinical and clinical data supports the posology intended for authori sation (5 ug of adjuvanted with 50 ug of Matrix -M1). T cell responses were Th1- skewed. Clinical phase 3 data confirm that the vaccine is immunogenic and the studied two dose schedule resulted in seroconversion in almost all participants. Also, in baseline seropositive subjects, the 2- dose regimen resulted in a markedly increased humoral immune response. Whether or not a single dose would also suffice in this subgroup is unknown, as data after a single dose have not been collected in the pivotal study. As expected, immune responses were somewhat lower in the adults 65 years of age , as well as in HIV seropositive participants ( for the latter group in both subgroups antibodies (binding and neutrali sing) were approximately 2-fold reduced). These findings raise no immediate concerns, but the magnitude as well as durability of immunogenicity of the vaccine in elderly subjects as well as medically stable HIV -positive subjects remains to be determined based on final study data. It is agreed that based on the available data, no dose adjustment is required in adults 65 years of age as also stated in the SmPC. In healthy COVID -19 na\u00efve individuals 18- 64 years of age of study 2019nCOV -101, at day 189 (approximately 5 months after the second dose), binding as well as functional antibody levels were approximately 10- fold reduced compared to the maximum at day 35; seroconversion rates remained at 100% for binding antibodies, but had declined to 64% for neutrali sing antibodies. The c linical relevance hereof, and whether or not (and if so, when) a booster dose should be recommended is currently unknown. Across all studies, f ew non -responders were seen for both the binding antibody as well as neutrali sation assay. L ower immune response was observed in study 2019nCoV -501 (conducted in South -Africa) as compared to study 2019nCoV -302 (conducted in the UK) . Furthermore, a lower vaccine efficacy has been reported for study 2019nCoV -501 as compared to 2019nCoV -302 (see clinical efficacy section for more details ). Although there are differences between the assays used in the two studies that may explain some of the observed differences in response levels, a resolutive explanation for the lower levels of neutralis ing antibody responses reported from Clinical Study 2019nCoV -501 has not been found . Importantly, the applicant states that no issues have been observed with the shipping or storage of the study vaccine in study 2019nCoV -501 (such as temperature excursions) that might have contributed to the reduced response levels. The reduced efficacy seen in study 2019nCoV -501 is according to the applicant directly attributable to the emergence of the Beta escape variant in South Africa during the study. While it is acknowledged that the emergence of the Beta variant likely has had a role in the reduced efficacy, it cannot be excluded that there are other factors that may have affected overall vaccine efficacy . However, given the lack of solid explanations as to why the immunogenicity was lower in 2019nCoV -501 and whether this can be linked to the reduced efficacy, no further action is currently required. The applicant is currently performing an analysis of immune correlates of risk and protection from the pre -crossover efficacy period for Clinical Study 2019nCoV -301 which may be able to provide additional insight in the implications of the observed lower immunogenicity in study 2019nCoV -501. A diminished response was also observed in participants in study 2019nCoV -302 who received a concomitant seasonal influenza vaccination (approx. 1.5 -fold). The clinical impact of the reduced response is unknown. The few cases of PCR -confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID - 19 observed in the substudy population (n=10 in tot al, 2 in the active arm and 8 in the placebo arm) are considered insufficient to dismiss the concern. SARS -CoV-2 neutrali sing antibody responses for the influenza substudy participants were not investigated by the applicant . Also , while negative impact of non-adjuvanted (quadrivalent) flu vaccine on NVX -CoV2373 is not expected, between CHMP assessment report Page 70/168 NVX-CoV2373 (adjuvanted vaccines (e.g. MF59 -adjuvanted trivalent flu vaccine such as used in study 2019nCoV -302) cannot be rul ed out, especially if accidentally injected at the same site, because of the similarity in the modes of action between the adjuvants present in the vaccines. However, in study 2019nCoV -302, only elderly participants received adjuvanted trivalent flu vaccin e, and there are too few elderly participants in the influenza sub- study for conclusions to be drawn. In short, the data from the flu substudy is considered too limited to support any recommendations regarding concomitant use of NVX -CoV2373 with influenza vaccines. Different PCR assays have been used in the different studies. All assays were however validated and expected to perform well. Further, sequencing of breakthrough cases has been performed. More information, including on the CT values of all positive samples, by virus strain (Wuhan vs. B.1.1.7, vs. other variants) will be provided in later CSRs. Several issues remain that require further investigation and that may be solved post -authorisation . These include i) investigation on the need of a boost er dose; ii) investigation on identifying an immunological correlate of protection, and iii) investigation (with regular updates) on the ability of the vaccine to neutralis e emerging SARS -CoV-2 variants. 2.6.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology In conclusion, aspects related to clinical pharmacology have been satisfactory addressed by the applicant . The immune response data provided in the interim reports overall support the choice of a 2 - dose schedule of NVX -CoV2373, with no apparent advantage for 25 vs. 5 g antigen doses in the adjuvanted formulations. The interim immunogenicity data indicates that immunogenicity is likely reduced in the elderly and HIV-positive subjects; the magnitude of this reduction remains to be determined. No conclusions can currently be reached on (i) durability of immune responses (especially in elderly vaccinees), and concomitant use of NVX -CoV2373 with influenza vaccines (especially adjuvanted influenza vaccines). The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the i ssues related to pharmacology: the applicant should submit final study reports from studies 2019nCoV -101 part 1 and 2, 2019nCoV - 301, 2019nCoV -302 and 2019nCoV -501 as soon as these are available, investigate the need of a booster dose, detail their plans to establish an immunologic correlate of protection, and investigate (with regular updates) the ability of the vaccine to neutralis e emerging SARS -CoV-2 variants. 2.6.5. Clinical efficacy 2.6.5.1. Dose response studies See section 2.6 on clinical pharmacology for an overview of the immunogenicity data from dose finding study 2019nCoV -101, Part 1 and Part 2. Overall, the safety and immunogenicity data obtained in Part 1 and Part 2 of 2019nCoV -101 provided support for the inclusion of the adjuvant and administration of a second dose, with no apparent advantage for 25 vs. 5 g antigen doses in the adjuvanted formulations. The immunogenicity analyses by age subgroup (humoral immunity only) show a potent response in both age groups, although the magnitude of the response wa s consistently lower in the older age stratum. The clinical relevance of this lower response can however not yet be determined. Clinical efficacy information for this age CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 71/168 stratum will come from the main studies described below. Reactogenicity was higher in the adjuvanted arms of the study and higher frequencies of local and systemic reactogenicity occurred in participants receiving the higher antigen dose (25 g) compared to the lower antigen dose (5 g). 2.6.5.2. Main studies Two pivotal studies are included for th is MAA: 2019nCoV -301 and 2019nCoV -302. These are phase 3, randomised, observer -blinded, placebo -controlled trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a SARS- CoV-2 rS with Matrix -M1 adjuvant in adult participants 18 years of age and older in the US, Mexico for study 2019nCoV -301 and the United Kingdom 2019nCoV & Study 2019nCoV -302 were presented together for the similar study sections, while they were reported separately to explain differences as needed. Study Participants The trials included healthy male or female participants aged 18 to 84 years (2019nCoV -302) or 18 years and older (2019nCoV -301), who did not have a history of laboratory -confirmed (by PCR or serology to SARS -CoV-2) COVID -19 infection at any time prior to r andomisation. Both trials focussed on enrolment of participants at high risk of complications due to COVID -19 due to underlying coming comorbidities or living/working conditions. Participants with stable chronic medical conditions were not excluded unless participants were immunocompromised (iatrogenic or pathogenic), had an autoimmune disease/condition or a current diagnosis of or treatment for cancer. Further, pregnant and breastfeeding women were also excluded from participation. Additionally, normal in clusion and exclusion criteria appropriate for a vaccine trial were in place. Treatments Participants were randomised to either 2 doses of 5 \u00b5g SARS- CoV-2 rS with 50 \u00b5g Matrix -M1 adjuvant or saline placebo (Sodium chloride (BP, sterile), 0.9%). In 2019nCoV -302, single dose vials manufactured from Emergent BioSolutions (Emergent) were used. Lot numbers were 2870- 101 and 2870- 102. The seasonal influenza vaccine co -administration sub - study will comprise a single IM injection (0.5 mL) of a n authorised influenza vaccine on Day 0 in an open-label manner. An unadjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine will be given to those 18 to 64 years of age, and an adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine will be given to those 65 years of age. In study 2019nCoV -301, material filled in multi- dose vials (MDV), manufactured by Par Pharmaceutical was used. The lot number was from Drug Product Lot 280003 manufactured at Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The lot was composed of drug substance and Matrix -M1, Lot GR1350007, manufactured at FujiFilm Diosynth Biotechnologies (FDBU) at the 2000 L scale. For information with regards to comparability between the batches produced at the two sites please see the sections 2.4 on Quality aspects. Of note, there are differences be tween the batches used in the different trials. In study 2019nCoV -301 the DP Lot PAR28003 was used which had a higher level of protein as well as higher levels of impurities compared to the DP Lots EBSI DP4 and EBSI DP5 used in as in trial 2019nCoV -101 and 2019nCoV -501. The commercial batches are more comparable to the lots used in the 2019nCOV -301 trial.

Outcomes/endpoints Primary endpoint ( 2019nCoV-301, 2019nCoV-302) : For both pivotal studies the primary e ndpoint is defined as: the first episode of PCR -positive mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 with onset at least 7 days after second study vaccination (e.g., Day 28), in serologically negative (to SARS -CoV-2) adult participants at baseline until the endpoin t-driven efficacy analysis is triggered by the occurrence of a prespecified number of blinded endpoints. The definition of severity of the endpoint can be found in table 20 below. Table 14.

For severe COVID *Participants with a single vital sign abnormality placing t hem in the moderate or severe categories must also meet the criteria for mild COVID - 19. Table 21 provides an overview of symptoms that would qualify for virological testing. Table 21. Qualifying Symptoms of Suspected COVID -19 Fever New onset cough New on set or worsening of shortness of breath or difficulty breathing compared to baseline New onset fatigue New onset generalised muscle or body aches New onset headache New loss of taste or smell Acute onset of sore throat, congestion, and runny nose New onset nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea Abbreviations: COVID -19 = coronavirus disease 2019. In study 2019nCoV-301, the eDiary would alert participants to start daily nasal self -swabbing for PCR testing within 3 days of symptom onset at home (3 days) and to initiate daily completion of the InFLUenza Patient -Reported Outcome (FLU -PRO) symptom reporting instrument for 10 days. Also, the eDiary alerted the study site to schedule a surveillance visit (Unscheduled Acute Illness Visit), which included taking of vital signs, a nasal swab and blood sample for serologic testing. PCR -positive swabs obtained outside the study from either asymptomatic participants, e .g. for travel or work, or from symptomatic infection not evaluated by swab(s) tested by the central laboratory, were not included in CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 75/168 the endpoint analyses. Active surveillance for COVID -19 will continue after the blinded crossover through the first 12 months of study. Passive surveillance of safety and efficacy via remote contacts or the scheduled visits will continue during m onths 12 to 24. For information on the PCR assays used, see section 2.6.2 of Clinical Pharmacology. In study 2019nCoV-302, participants received weekly reminders (email or text messages) to immediately contact the study team if they have experienced any new symptoms or health concerns that could be related to infection with SARS -CoV-2. If a participant experiences any symptom included in Table 21, this will trigger: - Nose/throat self -sampling once daily for 3 consecutive days. I f any test is found to be positive before 3 consecutive days of testing is performed, the full 3 consecutive tests may not be required. Participants will self -sample based on the training given on Day 0. - Nose/throat sampling will be started approximately 2 4 hours after the first symptom(s) are reported. - Participants will take their temperature daily for 10 days and complete a FLU_PRO diary to record symptoms. Study pa rticipants were discouraged from using non -study swabs; however, it was not prohibited. Non - study swabs include swabs taken during hospitali sations, ER visits, local tests performed at the study sites, or private testing facilities. If a valid report existed for testing in any of these conditions, it was treated identically to a study swab. Newly discovered symptoms of suspected COVID -19 will trigger a COVID -19 Surveillance Visit. During the surveillance visit, symptoms will be reviewed and confirmed, vital signs will be taken, any health care visits will be documented and use of concomitant medication recorded. Secondary endpoints 2019nCoV-301: - First episode of PCR -positive COVID -19, as defined under the primary endpoint, shown by gene sequencing to represent a variant not considered as a \"variant of concern / interest\" according to the CDC Variants Classification . - First episode of PCR -positive moderate or severe COVID -19, as defined under the primary endpoint. - ANY symptomatic SARS -CoV-2 infection, defined as: PCR -positive nasal swab and 1 of any of the symptoms considered qualifying for COVID -19 (Table 21) . Exploratory endpoints 2019nCoV-301: - -First episode of PCR -positive COVID -19, as defined under the primary endpoint, shown by gene sequencing to represent a \"variant of concern / interest\" according to the CDC Variants Classification. Secondary endpoints 2019nCoV-302: - First occurrence of virologically confirmed (by PCR to SARS -CoV-2), symptomatic moderate or severe COVID -19 with onset at least 7 days after second study vaccination (e.g., Day 28) in serologically negative (to SARS -CoV-2) adult participants at baseline un til the endpoint -driven efficacy analysis is triggered by the occurrence of a prespecified number of blinded endpoints. (Defined as Key by the applicant). CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 76/168 - First occurrence of virologically confirmed (by PCR to SARS -CoV-2), symptomatic severe COVID -19 with onset at least 7 days after second study vaccination (e.g., Day 28) in serologically negative (to SARS- CoV-2) adult participants at baseline until the endpoint- driven efficacy analysis is triggered by the occurrence of a prespecified number of blinded endpoints. - First occurrence of virologically confirmed (by PCR to SARS -CoV-2), symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19, with onset at least 7 days after second study vaccination (e.g., Day 28) in adult participants regardless of their serostatus at base line. - First occurrence of COVID -19 requiring hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission or mechanical ventilation linked to any virologically confirmed (by PCR to SARS -CoV-2) COVID -19 with onset at least 7 days after second study vaccination (e.g ., Day 28) in adult participants regardless of their serostatus at baseline. Exploratory endpoints 2019nCoV-302: - First occurrence of virologically confirmed (by PCR to SARS -CoV-2), symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 with onset at least 14 days after first study vaccination (e.g., Day 14) in serologically negative (to SARS -CoV-2) adult participants at baseline until the endpoint- driven efficacy analysis is triggered by the occurrence of a prespecified number of blinded endpoints. - Analysis of efficacy against symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19, with onset from at least 7 days after second study vaccination (e .g., Day 28) in the initial set of vaccinations in seronegative adult participants by age (< 65 and 65), in racial and ethnic minorities, and in those with comorbid conditions. Sample size 2019nCoV-301 The sample size for the original study design (described through protocol version 6.0) was driven by the total number of cases expected to achieve statistical significance for the primary efficacy endpoint; a total of up to approximately 30,000 participants 18 years of age would be enrolled to provide a target of 144 symptomatic PCR -confirmed SARS- CoV-2 infections. Change during study : Given the mandate from the US Govern ment that all adults would be eligible for an EUA vaccine as of 01 May 2021 and the decreasing prevalence of COVID -19 in the US during the timeframe for case accrual, the applicant identified that it would become extremely difficult to continue accruing CO VID-19 cases. The applicant implemented the blinded crossover in Clinical Study 2019nCoV -301 on 20 April 2021 following accumulation of the median 2- month safety follow -up (targeted for 19 April 2021) and accumulation of cases for the efficacy analysis. Wi th the implementation of the blinded crossover, the placebo -controlled portion of Clinical Study 2019nCoV - 301 ended. In a protocol revision the two interim analyses for efficacy and futility that were planned, were removed. Only one analysis will be perfor med. It was assumed as an example that with 75 events the minimum VE needed to demonstrate a lower bound of the confidence interval to be >30% would be VE 56%. 2019nCoV-302 This study is designed to enrol approximately 15,000 participants, who will be init ially randomised 1:1 into the study vaccine groups. The sample size is driven by the total number of events expected to achieve statistical significance for the primary efficacy endpoint. A target of 100 mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 cases was chosen to provide > 95% power for 70% or higher vaccine efficacy (VE). CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 77/168 A single interim analysis of efficacy will be conducted based on the accumulation of approximately 50% (50 events) of the total anticipated primary endpoints using Lan -DeMets alpha- spending f unction for Pocock boundary conditions, with a planned one -sided alpha of 0.01550 at 50% of the data and 0.01387 at the final analysis. Randomisation and Blinding (masking) In 2019nCoV -301, participants were randomised in a 2:1 ratio stratified by age grou p (18- 64, 65 years of age), using randomly varying block sizes between 3 and 12. No formal stratification by site was conducted, however, at the time of randomisation of a participant at a site, a full block would be assigned to the site in order to maintain treatment assignment balance in the planned ratio at each site and allow for site and region effects to be assessed. In 2019nCoV -302, participants were randomised to NVX -CoV2373 or placebo a 1:1 ratio via block randomisation to NVX -CoV2373 or placebo, stratified by site and by age (<65 years, 65 years). Both trials were designed as observer blinded trials. To maintain the blind, unblinded site personnel will manage study vaccine logistics, preparation, and administration so as to maintain the blind from the remainder of the site personnel and participants. The unblinded site personnel will not be involved in study-related assessments or have participant contact for data collection following study vaccine administration. It was made clear that for both studies b lue-coloured translucent tape will be used on the syringe barrel to maintain the blind Clear rules surr ounding potential unblinding were included in the protocols, however, communication between blinded and unblinded teams was possible. The DSMB was unblinded and reviewed the distribution of PCR+ cases over the trial arms during the study. Statistical metho ds The primary efficacy analysis set for both trials 2019nCoV -302 and 2019nCoV -301 was defined as the PP-EFF set, consisting of all randomised participants without major protocol deviations, who are seronegative (for SARS -CoV-2) at baseline and do not have a laboratory confirmed current SARS -CoV- 2 infection with symptom onset up to 6 days after the second dose, and who have received both doses less than 45 days apart. Supportive efficacy analyses were defined in the intent -to-treat (ITT) (2019nCoV -302 study )/ full analysis set (FAS) (2019nCoV -301 study) sets including all participants who are randomised and have received at least 1 dose of study vaccine. For the 2019nCoV -301, a second per -protocol efficacy (PP-EFF-2) analysis set was defined followed the sam e method described in the PP -EFF population including all participants regardless of baseline serostatus. For the primary analysis for both trials the VE was calculated as 100% x (1 - RR), where RR = Relative Risk calculated as ratio of incidence rates (SA RS CoV -2 Rs with Matrix -M1 / Placebo), presented with 95% CI and an unadjusted one -sided p- value for testing H 0: VE 30%. The primary endpoint was to be evaluated using a modified Poisson regression fitted to the occurrence of PCR confirmed COVID -19 disease (no infection, or one or more infections) with onset between 7 days after second study vaccination and end of study at 12 months (+15 days). The model included stratification factors and treatment group as fixed effects and robust error variances (Zou, 2004) as well as the natural log of the surveillance time as an offset. The explanatory variables included the treatment group and the stratification variables (age group (<65/ 65 years) and region [pooled sites] for study 302 only). The pooling of sites into regions will be determined and documented prior to breaking the blind for the 302 study. Where the model failed due sparsity of data, the Clopper Pearson approach, adjusted for surveillance time, was to be used. A sensitivity analysis was planned in both trials using a stratified Cox Proportional Hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling on the PP - EFF analysis. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 78/168 A primary estimand was defined for 2019nCoV -302. This estimand seeks to understand efficacy during a surveillance period (7 days to 12 months after second vaccination), which starts after the vaccine is considered to have stimulated an immune response in adults na\u00efve to SARS -CoV-2 infection (confirmed seronegative) who comply with the dosing schedule and do not start an infection prior to 7 days after second vaccination. A hypothetical strategy is used for unrelated deaths and significant protocol deviations (such as use of alternative vaccines and prohibited medications) so that interest lies in the hypothetical situation that these do not occur. As at the time of writing the protocol the estimand framework had not been fully implemented by all regulators gl obally, for pragmatic reasons, it was later decided to introduce the estimand framework, therefore it is not fully implemented. No estimand was defined for 2019nCoV -301. For 2019nCoV -302, the one- sided alpha was calculated using the Lan -DeMets alpha -spending for Pocock boundary conditions to account for the interim analysis. For 2019nCoV -301, two formal interim analyses for efficacy and a futility were planned. However, the protocol was revised while the study was ongoing to perform one single primary analysis. This analysis was planned to be performed when the blinded crossover will be implemented, the timing has not been clarified. For 2019nCoV -301, sensitivity analyses were planned to evaluate potential bias due to differential early unblinding: 1) Incl uding additional potential covariates; 2) Using a Cox PH model with Inverse Probability of Censoring Weights (IPCW) (e.g., Robins 1993, Robins & Rotnitzky 1992, Robins & Finkelstein 2000); 2) Using an alternative Cox PH model with multiple -imputation using Zhao's method. For 2019nCoV -302, data from the blinded crossover period as well as incomplete or unavailable data from the initial vaccination period was excluded from the efficacy analyses. For 2019nCoV -301, in general, missing data have been excluded, n o imputations were conducted for missing efficacy data. A tipping point analysis was to be conducted for both trials to assess the impact of missing values on the primary conclusions. Subgroup analyses were predefined for a range of subgroups based on age, sex, race and comorbidities, ethnicity and race. The statistical analysis plan of 2019nCoV -301 includes pre- specification of how waning of efficacy will be studied, the statistical analysis plan of 2019nCoV -302 will be updated to include similar methodology. Results Recruitment Study 2019nCoV-301 was initiated on 27 December 2020 (first participant screened) and completed enrolment on 18 February 2021 at 119 sites across the US and Mexico. The data cut-off date for the 60-day median safety follow -up analysis was 19 April 2021; collection of efficacy and safety follow -up data continued for events that began on or before 19 April 2021 through 01 June 2021. The study remains ongoing through approximatel y 2 years follow- up from the Day 21 injection. Study 2019nCoV-302 was initiated on 28 September 2020 (first participant screened) and completed enrolment on 28 November 2020 at 33 sites across the UK. The data cut -off date of the interim efficacy analysis was 10 January 2021, the data cut -off date for the final efficacy analysis was 29 January 2021, and the data cut -off date for all other analyses was 23 February 2021. All data were fully cleaned and locked on 26 January 2021 for the interim analysis and on 15 March 2021 for the final analysis. The study remains ongoing through approximately 1 year follow -up from the Day 21 injection. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 79/168 Participant flow Figure 4 .

Median age was 47.0 years, with all participants ranging in age from 18 to 95 years. Approxima tely 11.8% of participants were 65 years of age, with 10.7% aged 65 to 74 years and 1.7% (n=405) aged 75 to 84 years. Approximately half the participants were male (51.8%), while the majority (75.9%) were White, and not of Hispanic or Latino orig in (78.2%) and located in the United States (94.0%). Black or African Americans (11.0%), American Indians or Alaska Natives (6.2%), and Asians (4.4%) were well represented compared to the US population (US Census Bureau 2021). The majority of participants were overweight or obese (69.9%), with more than a third being obese (37.2%). Most participants (95.2%) were categori sed as high -risk adults for acquiring or experiencing complications of COVID -19. A breakdown of underlying comorbidities at baseline in the study population is presented in Table 24. Baseline characteristics were similar between the PP -EFF analysis set and the safety population. Further, within the Safety population, most participants (93.5%) had a seronegative (based on anti -NP serology) and PCR negative (based on negative status to randomi sation.

Notes: Medical History is coded using Version 23.1. participants randomi sed, 29,949 (100%) were in the ITT Analysis Set, 29,582 (98.8%) were in the FAS, and 29,582 (98.8%) were in the Safety Analysis Set. The PP -EFF Analysis Set included 25,452 (85.0%) -CoV2373 group and 8,140 (81.5%) in the placebo group. Overall, data analysis sets were generally well balanced between the 2 study vaccine groups. Table 18. Analysis Sets (All Randomis ed Participants, 2019nCoV-301) The FAS exclud ed 289 (1.0%) participants (195 [1.0%] in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 94 [0.9%] in the placebo group), predominantly due to the exclusion of all participants from Site US151 and 14 participants from Site 076. Site US151 is being terminated from participating in Clinical Study 2019nCoV -301 for critical and major observations identified during a for -cause audit regarding the CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 86/168 Principal Investigator's lack of compliance with regulations in place. There were 280 subjects randomi sed at this site with approximately 248 subjects ongoing. Study discontinuation occurred in 1,619 (8.1%) in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 1,391 (13.9%) in the placebo group, most frequently due to withdrawal by participant (NVX -CoV2373 5.5%, placebo 11%). Fourteen participants from Site US076 were excluded due to having received NVX -CoV2373 from single -dose vials rather than the multi- dose vial. The PP- EFF Analysis Set excluded 4,497 (15.0%) participants the NVX -CoV2373 group and 1,844 [18.5%] in the placebo group). The most frequent (incidence > 2.00% in any vaccine group) reasons for exclusion were baseline positive anti -NP result (5.6%), censored prior to observation period (4.5%), did not complete vac cination schedule (4.0%), and protocol deviation (3.3%). Approximately 18% of participants were unblinded to study treatment assignment during the course of the study. The most frequent reason was to receive an authori sed vaccine. There was an obvious imbalance between treatment groups with a higher proportion of placebo recipients (23.4%) requesting unblinding than vaccine recipients (15.2%), observed for most clinical sites. It is speculated that this difference may reflect the perception of study participants based on their reactogenicity symptoms or serologic testing outside of the study. No obvious association between reactogenicity profile and request for unblinding has been observed (supporting tables not shown). Data on serologic testing outside of t he study has not been collected. Further it is noted that a larger proportion of participants in the placebo group did not receive their second dose compared to the participants in NVX-CoV2373 group (3.2% vs 4.4%). Also, a larger proportion of participants in the placebo group discontinued the study (8.1% vs 13.9%). 2019nCoV-302 Of the 15,187 participants randomi sed, 15,139 (99.7%) were in the ITT and Safety Analysis Sets with 7,569 in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 7,570 in the placebo group ( Table 26). The PP- EFF Analysis Set included 14,039 (92.4%) randomi sed participants, with 7,020 in the NVX - CoV2373 group and 7,019 in the placebo group. A total of 1,100 (7.3%) participants were excluded from the PP -EFF Analysis Set, the most frequent (incidence > 1.0%) rea sons for exclusion from the PP - EFF Analysis Set were positive serostatus before 7 days after second vaccination, missed 1 dose of study vaccine, and positive PCR test before 7 days after second vaccination. Approximately one -third of participants (34.6%) w ere unblinded to study vaccine assignment during the course of the study). The most frequent reason was receipt of an authorised vaccine. Most (98.2%) unblinded participants continued to be followed up in the study. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 87/168 Table 19. Analysis Sets (All Randomis ed Subjects Analysis Set 2019nCoV-302) Outcomes and estimation Primary Endpoint 2019nCoV-301 After the protocol revision one single primary analysis was performed. For the primary analysis of the primary endpoint, there were 77 cases . Of these cases, 14 (0.1%) were in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 63 (0.8%) were in the placebo group; all 14 cases in the NVX -CoV2373 group were mild in severity; 59 cases in the placebo gro up were mild or moderate and 5 were severe. There were 3 hospitali sations due to COVID -19 among the 77 per -protocol COVID -19 cases in this study. The resultant VE 90.40% (95% CI: 82.88, 94.62), with a p -value of < 0.001 confirming the lower bound of the two -sided 95% CI > 30% and meeting the prespecified study success criterion of the study. 2019nCoV-302 Confirmatory interim analysis There were 62 cases accrued for the prespecified interim ana lysis of the primary endpoint, with 6 (<0.1%) in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 56 (0.8%) in the placebo group. The resultant estimated VE was (alpha -adjusted 96.9% LBCI > 30% meeting the prespecified st udy success criterion. Final primary efficacy analysis There were 106 cases for the final prespecified analysis of the primary endpoint, with 10 (0.1%) in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 96 (1.4%) in the placebo group. All but 4 cases were mild or moderate in severity, with all 4 severe cases, including 1 hospitalisation and 1 person with a pulmonary embolism, occurring in the placebo group. The resultant estimated VE 89.7% (95% 30% meeting the prespecified study su ccess criterion. These findings confirmed the results of the interim analysis of the primary endpoint. Secondary Endpoints 2019nCoV -301 CHMP assessment episode of PCR -positive COVID -19, as defined under the primary endpoint, shown by gene sequencing to represent a variant not considered as a \"variant of concern / interest\" according to the CDC Variants Classification. Viral genetic sequences were available for 54 of 77 primary endpoint cases in the PP -EFF. Ten of these cases (0 in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 10 [0.1%] in the placebo group) were prototype- like and did not contain any of the mutations that would identify them as a VOC/VOI, including 3 that were moderate or severe. Resequencing of the PCR -positive cases that had not initially yielded sequencing results r esulted in an additional 3 mild cases with non -VOC/VOI sequences in the placebo group (for a total of 13 [0.2%] cases). The VE of NVX -CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 due to a SARS - CoV-2 variant not considered as a VOC/VOI in serologically negative (to SARS -CoV-2) adult 100) with the 3 additional sequenced cases. - First episode of PCR -positive moderate or severe COVID -19, as defined under the primar y endpoint. There were 14 cases of PCR -confirmed symptomatic moderate or severe COVID -19 with onset from at least 7 days after second vaccination accrued for this analysis, with 0 in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 14 (0.2%) in the placebo group. The resultant V E of NVX -CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic moderate or severe COVID -19 in baseline seronegative (to -SARS- CoV-2) adult participants was First episode of PCR -positive COVID -19, as defined under the primary endpoint, shown by gene seque ncing to represent a \"variant of concern / interest\" according to the CDC Variants Classification. Of the 276 cases with onset from first vaccination, 14 were virologically confirmed with at least one COVID -19 symptom and 262 were mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19. Of the 262 PCR -positive cases of mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19, 203 had sequence data available as summari sed. Of these, 82 were identified as VOC/VOI clades, lineages, or variants of SARS -CoV-2. The most common VOC were B.1.1.7 (Alpha), wh ich occurred in 46 cases. During the period of case accrual, no cases of infection due to the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant were identified.

In the NVX -CoV2373 group, all 6 cases were mild in severity; in the placebo group, 9 of 38 cases were moderate or severe. The resultant VE of NVX - CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 due to a SARS -CoV-2 variant considered a VOC or VOI in baseline seronegative adult participants was 93. 2% (95% CI: 83.97, 97.1), with a p- value < 0.0 01 confirming the lower bound of the one -sided 95% CI > 0%. Secondary Endpoints 2019nCoV by strain (PP -EFF analysis set) PCR results of the final analysis by SARS- CoV-2 strain showed estimated VEs of NVX -CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic mild, m oderate, or severe COVID -19 in baseline seronegative (to SARS -CoV-2) participants were 86.3% CI: B.1.1.7 and 96.4% (95% CI: 73.8, 99.5) for the ancestral (Wuhan) strain. - Protection against symptomatic moderate or severe COVID -19 with onset at least 7 days after second study vaccination (e.g., Day 28) in baseline seronegative subjects. (defined as key by the applicant) CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 90/168 There were 77 out of 106 cases of PCR -confirmed symptomatic moderate or severe COVID -19 with onset from at least 7 days after second vaccination, with 9 (0.1%) in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 68 (1.0%) in the placebo group. The resultant estimated VE of NVX -CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic moderate or severe COVID -19 in baseline seronegative (to SARS -CoV- 2) adult participants was 86.9% (95% CI: 73.7, 93.5). - Protection against symptomatic severe COVID -19 with onset at least 7 days after second study vaccination (e.g., Day 28) in baseline seronegative subjects. At the time of the final analysis there were 4 cases classified as severe in the placebo group and none in the NVX -CoV2373 group occurring at least 7 days after the second dose in serologically negative adult participants in the PP -EFF analysis set. - Protection against hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission or mechanical ventilation linked to any virologically confirmed COVID -19 with onset at least 7 days after second study vaccination (e.g., Day 28) in adult participants regardless of their serostatus at baseline. There were 2 cases of P CR-confirmed symptomatic moderate or severe COVID -19 requiring hospitalis ation, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation with onset from at least 7 days after second vaccination in serologically negative adult participants, with 0 in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 2 in the placebo group. - Protection against COVID -19 in adults regardless of baseline serostatus There were 107 cases of PCR -confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 with an onset from at least 7 days after second vaccination in participants regardless of baseline serostatus, with 10 (0.1%) in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 97 (1.3%) in the placebo group. V accine efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 in adult participants regardless of baseline serostatus was estimated to be 89.8% (95% CI: 80.5, 94.7). There were 183 cases of PCR -confirmed mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 with onset from first vaccination through the data cut -off date of the final analysis of the primary endpoint. PCR -confirmed COVID -19 occurred in -years) in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 141 (1.9%) cases (1.728/1,000 person -years) in the place bo group at the time of the final analysis of the primary endpoint (median surveillance time 85 days), with no participant having more than 1 episode of COVID -19. The resultant estimated VE of NVX -CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe CO VID-19 from first vaccination in adults regardless of 70.5% (95% CI: 58.0, 79.6; Clopper -Pearson method). The vaccine efficacy against confirmed mild, moderate or severe COVID -19 with onset after first vaccination in adults regardle ss of baseline serostatus is shown in Table 27 for different time periods.

The median duration of illness was 12.5 days in the vaccine group and 13.0 days in the placebo group. Ancillary analyses Subgroup analyses 2019nCoV-301 The VEs of NVX -CoV2373 at the time of the final analysis of the primary endpoint, for which an adequate number of cases were identified, were consistent across major demographic and baseline characteristic subgroups and are shown in the tabled overview below . The relatively lower VE of 67.3% (95% CI: 18.7, 86.8) for participants of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, may reflect social or economic characteristics in the locations wh ere the participants were enrolled. Immunogenicity, measured by anti-S IgG ELISA assay, and hACE2 receptor binding inhibition titers at baseline and Day 35, demonstrated that the immune responses in Hispanic/Latino participants were equivalent (although uniformly slightly higher) to those in non -Hispanic/Latino participants.

CHMP assessment report in studies 2019nCoV -301 and 2019nCoV -302 To assess whether potential awareness of treatment allocation in study 2019nCoV -301 had an impact on the reporting of symptoms and collection of endpoint data, the applicant was requested to provide information on the number of acute illness visits, number of swabs taken and percentage positive and negative tests. A summari sing overview* is displayed below: *Calculations of the percentages ha ve been performed by the assessment team . Up to 4 tests could have been taken per person, although not all participants had in fact taken 4 tests. This number was considered for the calculations. There were no major differences in acute illness visits betw een the trial arms. The percentage of participants randomi sed who were tested and had a negative test result was comparable over the study arms, while the percentage positive tests was different. Summary of main efficacy results The following tables summ arise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well as the benefit -risk assessment (see later sections).

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of NVX -CoV2373 compared to placebo on the occurrence of symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe confirmed COVID -19 as demonstrated by qualitative PCR in serologically na\u00efve (to SARS - CoV-2) healthy HIV -negative and medically stable HIV - positive adult participants (an alysed as an overall population). Methods Eligible HIV -negative participants (Cohort 1) were healthy males/females 18 to < 85 years of age, with a BMI between 17- 40 kg/m2 and a documented HIV -negative test result. Eligible HIV -positive participants (Coho rt 2) were medically stable (free of opportunistic infections) males/females, 18 to < 65 years of age, with a BMI between 17- 40 kg/m2, receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy using the same regimen within at least 8 weeks before screening, and hav ing an HIV -1 viral load < 1000 copies/mL within 45 days of randomisation. Excluded participants, regardless of HIV status, included pregnant women, and persons with potential COVID -19. A negative SARS -CoV-2 results within 5 days prior to first vaccination was required. Enrolment was staggered to ensure safety. Participants 65 to < 85 years of age were only enrolled at second stage. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive up to 2 IM injections (Day 0 and Day 21) of SARS -CoV-2 rS with Matrix -M1 adjuvant o r placebo. At 6 months (\u00b1 15 days) after the last vaccination in the initial vaccination period (Day 201), participants were to be given the option to enter into the crossover vaccination period. The duration of the study, excluding screening, was to be approximately 12 months after the last vaccination in the initial vaccination period. The primary endpoint was PCR -confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 in serologically na\u00efve (to SARS -CoV-2) healthy HIV -negative and medically stable HIV -positive adult participants, analysed overall, with a lower bound CI of > 0, from 7 days after the second vaccine dose until the endpoint- driven efficacy analysis is triggered by the occurrence of a prespecified number of CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 100/168 blinded endpoints across the 2 study vaccine arms and/or at prespecified time points during the initial vaccination period. Secondary endpoints included the efficacy in HIV -positive and HIV -negative participants analysed separately, as well as protection against symptomatic mild or moderate or symptomatic moderate or severe COVID -19. Protection against COVID -19 requiring hospitali sation (regardless of severity) or resulting in death was also analysed. Of note, the immunogenicity and safety objectives and endpoints are discussed in the corre sponding sections of this AR. Results Study 2019nCoV -501 was initiated on 17 August 2020 (first participant screened) and completed enrolment into the initial phase on 25 November 2020. Participants were enrolled at 16 sites in South Africa. In total, 4,419 subjects were randomised (4,173 HIV -negative and 246 HIV -positive). At the cut- off date, 4,325 (97.9%) were continuing in follow -up and 94 (2.1%) had discontinued the study. The PP - EFF Analysis Set included 2,770 (62.7%) participants. The most frequent reasons for exclusion from the PP- EFF Analysis Set were positive PCR test or PCR -confirmed illness episode before 7 days after second study vaccination (n=1,488, 33.7%) and missed 1 dose of study vaccine (n=148, 3.3%). Demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the NVX -CoV2373 and placebo groups, overall and by HIV status. Of participants, 94% were HIV -negative. Median age was 28 years (range: 18 to 84 40% races, were Asian; and 2% were Hispanic or Latino. 5.5%. were HIV -positive. At baseline, 34.1% of participants were seropositive for SARS -CoV-2. For HIV positive participants, the majority (63.9%) had no co -morbidities. Median baseline CD4 level was 738 cells/L (range 80 to 2,076 cells/L) and median baseline HIV viral load was 63.5 copies/mL (range 20 to 735 copies/mL). Primary Efficacy Endpoint A total of 44 cases of symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe C OVID -19 cases in serologically na\u00efve healthy HIV -negative and medically stable HIV -positive adult participants were accrued between 23 November and 30 December 2020 for the official event -driven analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (data extraction 18 January 2021), with 15 (1.11%) cases in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 29 (2.19%) cases in the placebo group. The VE was 49.4% (95% CI: 6.1, 72.8). All but 1 case was mild or moderate in severity, with the severe case occurring in the placebo group. Final ana lysis A total of 147 symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 cases among all adult participants, seronegative (to SARS -CoV-2) at baseline, were accrued for the complete analysis (PP -EFF Analysis Set) of the primary efficacy endpoint (data extraction 23 February 2021), with 51 (3.62%) cases for NVX-CoV2373 versus 96 (7.05%) cases for placebo. The resultant VE of NVX -CoV2373 in prevention of symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 in adult participants, seronegative (to SARS -CoV-2) at baseline, was 48.6% (95% CI: 28.4, 63.1). The cumulative incidence curves in both vaccine groups is presented in Figure 11. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 101/168 Figure 8 . Cumulative Incidence Curves for the First PCR -confirmed SARS -CoV-2 Positivity with Symptomatic Mild, Moderate or Severe COVID -19 from 7 Days after Second Vaccination (e.g., Day 28) Analy sed Overall and in Serologically Na\u00efve Healthy HIV -Negative and Medically Stable HIV -Positive Participants (PP -EFF Analysis Set, 2019nCoV-501) Prevention of COVID -19 hospitalisation There were 5 cases of hospitalisation among all adult participants seronegative (to SARS -CoV-2) at baseline, from 7 days after second vaccination (Day 28). All occurred in the placebo group. Prevention of COVID -19 stratified by severity Among all participants seronegative (to SARS -CoV-2) at baseline, from 7 days after second vaccination, the level of prevention of mild COVID -19 was 68.7%, 95% CI: 38.5, 84.1, that of Efficacy by SARS -CoV-2 variant Forty-one (93.2%) of 44 participants with a primary efficacy endpoint had whole genome sequence data available (samples from 3 cases in the placebo group could not be sequenced), and 3 8 (92.7%) of 41 were identified as the B.1.351 variant, resulting in a post -hoc VE of NVX -CoV2373 (PP -EFF Analysis Set) in prevention of symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 in all adult participants, seronegative (to SARS -CoV-2) at baseline, of 43.0% (95% CI: - 9.8, 70.4) for the B.1.351 South African variant. Efficacy in subgroups By SARS -CoV-2 serostatus at baseline A total of 147 and 39 symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 cases occurring at least 7 days post dose 2, among all adult p articipants, seronegative (to SARS -CoV-2) or seropositive at baseline were accrued for analysis. The VEs of NVX -CoV2373 in prevention of COVID -19 in all adult participants, seronegative (to SARS -CoV-2) or seropositive at baseline, shown in Table 32 . By HIV status CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 102/168 Among HIV -negative participants seronegative (to SARS -CoV-2) at baseline, the VE of NVX -CoV2373 in prevention of symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 was 55. 4% (95% CI: 35.9, 68.9). Among HIV -positive participants seronegative (to SARS -CoV-2) at baseline the VE was - 35.4% (95% CI: -236.9, 45.6) , as shown in Table 3 2. Table 25 Vaccine Efficacy of PCR -Confirmed SARS -CoV-2 Positivity with Symptomatic Mild, Moderate, or Severe COVID -19 from 7 Days after Second Vaccination (e .g., Day 28) with NVX-CoV2373 or Placebo Overall and in Healthy HIV-Negative and Medically Stable HIV - Positive Participants Stratified by Baseline Serosta tus and Regardless of Baseline Serostatus (PP-EFF and Second PP -EFF Analysis Sets, 2019nCoV-501) on clinical efficacy COVID -19 vaccine NVX -CoV2373 is meant for active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS- CoV-2 in individuals 18 years of age and older. The following clinical studies were conducted by the applicant : two pivotal phase 3 trials, 2019nCoV -301 and 2019nCoV -302, and a supportive phase 2 trial, 2019nCoV -501, conducted in South Africa in approximately 4500 subjects including HIV+ subjects in addition to a phase 1/2 dose finding trial, 2019nCoV -101. Design and conduct of clinical studies The efficacy of the selected dose of 5 g SARS- CoV-2 rS vaccine +50 g Matrix- M1 adjuvant (NVX - COV2373) was assessed in two pivotal phase 3 clinical trials, 2019nCoV -302 and 2019nCoV -301. These were two randomised, observer blinded placebo -controlled trials conducted in approximately 30,000 adults aged 18 years or older in the US and Mexico (2019nCoV -301) and 15,000 adults aged 18-84 years in the UK (2019nCoV -302). The main efficacy objective of both trials was to demonstrate protective efficacy of NVX -CoV2373 given as a 2- dose vaccination regimen three weeks apart, in the prevention of virologically confirmed (by PCR to SARS -CoV-2), symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) with onset 7 days after second vaccination, as compared to placebo, in serologically negative (to SARS -CoV-2) adults. Both studies were placebo controlled, which is acceptable as there was no authorised COVID -19 vaccine at the start of either study. In study 2019nCoV -302, single dose vials manufactured from Emergent BioSolutions (Emergent) were administered to the NVX -CoV23 73 group. In study 2019nCoV - 301, material filled in multi -dose vials (MDV), manufactured by Par Pharmaceutical was used. The study population comprised of subjects 18 years and older, including individuals with underlying but stable chronic disease (e.g. diabetes, chronic lung disease, obesity) and older adults over 65 years CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 103/168 of age. In both studies efforts were made to include persons who were at high risk of COVID -19, aiming to include at least 25% of participants who were 65 years of age as well as pri oritising other groups that are most affected by COVID -19, including racial and ethnic minorities. Pregnant and breastfeeding women were excluded from the trials as well as persons who were immune suppressed or had an immunodeficiency; few HIV+ were enroll ed in supportive trial 2019nCoV -501. As both groups are highly relevant target groups for COVID -19 vaccination, it is important that the performance of NVX -CoV2373 is evaluated in these subgroups as soon as possible. Regarding children and adolescents, a p aediatric development plan has been agreed with Paediatric Committee (PDCO) . In 2019nCoV -302, participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio stratified by site and by age (18 to 64, 65 years). In 2019nCoV -301, participants were randomi sed in a 2:1 ratio to NVX-CoV2373 or placebo and stratified by age (18 to 64 years and 65 years). By providing full blocks to a site, the randomisation was also stratified by site. An adapted randomisation list, including randomisation time, will be shared by the applicant post-authorisation . Further, both trials were designed as single- blinded trials, with vaccination administrators potentially being aware of treatment allocation. In addition, although separate blinded and unblinded teams were set -up, any communication betwee n the blinded and unblinded teams cannot be fully excluded and therefore blinding cannot be fully guaranteed. The primary endpoint for both trials, i.e. the first episode of PCR -positive mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 with onset at least 7 days after second study vaccination (Day 28), is in line with applicable regulatory guidance on the evaluation of COVID -19 vaccines, is clinically relevant and agreed. Cases were either classified as being mild, moderate or severe according to pre- defined definitions which differed slightly between the two trials. Whilst it may be argued that cases classified as moderate according to these definitions were in fact mild, this has little impact on the actual outcome of the trials as all cases regardless of severity are considered for the primary endpoint. However , it should be kept in mind for the interpretation of secondary analyses. The classification of cases was performed with a programmatic algorithm. In 2019nCoV -301, because of the potential for the programmatic al gorithm to over -estimate the severity of disease (largely due to spuriously low oxygen saturations reported by participants), further medical review of all cases categori sed as \"severe\" was performed by independent infectious disease and critical care phys icians. This was not done for 2019nCoV -302. Further, the accuracy of the programmatic algorithms to distinguish mild from moderate cases is unknown, therefore categorisation of cases according to severity were not included in the SmPC. Severe cases may be reflected following review of narratives. In general methods for case detection appear sufficiently appropriate. Assessment of probable COVID - 19 cases followed reporting by study participants of respiratory and clinical signs/symptoms recogni sed to be predictive of COVID -19 (predefined) and subsequent laboratory confirmation of infection of SARS- CoV-2 in nasal swabs by RT -PCR. Swabs were through self -swabbing by individuals (2019nCoV -301, 2019nCoV -302) and by study personnel at a triggered sur veillance visit (2019nCoV - 301 only). Non -study swabs were permitted in 2019nCoV -302, and if a valid report existed for testing outside the study these swabs were treated identically to a study swab. E ven though non- study swabs were discouraged, non -study s wabs accounted for 15% of positive swabs overall. This is considerable. Furthermore, in comparison with study swabs there was a higher positivity rate in both the NVX - CoV2373 as the placebo group. The difference in positivity rate between non -study and stu dy swabs was higher in the vaccine vs the placebo group. It is considered that this will not impact the overall conclusion of the trial. However, the applicant is expected to submit sensitivity analyses in which non - study swabs were excluded at the time of the next interim CSR submission (Q1 2022). Also, a discussion of reasons for this discrepancy in positivity rates will be expected to be submitted with these sensitivity analyses post-authorisation . Numerous secondary endpoints were listed for both trials with varying relevance. For both trials the applicant listed 'key' secondary endpoints: protection against moderate or severe PCR confirmed assessment EMA/783213/2021 Page 104/168 COVID -19 -302) (not multiplicity controlled) and protection against COVID -19 not caused by Variants of Int erest or Concern (VOI/VOC) (multiplicity controlled). Whilst protection against severe COVID -19 (including hospital admissions, ICU admissions and death) is considered an important endpoint, protection against 'moderate to severe' is considered of less rel evance, particularly as the definition of moderate has large overlap with mild symptomatic disease and there is uncertainty around the accuracy of the assessment of moderate cases. Further, whilst it is considered relevant to determine whether the immune r esponse elicited by the vaccine also protects against circulating variants which are of interest from a public health perspective due to higher transmissibility or more severe disease, this is difficult to determine, as comparisons may be biased due to the non-random introduction of these variants. It is not considered very relevant to have an estimate of efficacy against variants that are not classified as being of concern or interest, which is the key secondary endpoint for 2019nCoV -301, therefore the hierarchical testing approach is considered of limited value. For study 2019nCoV -302 a single interim analysis of efficacy using the Lan -DeMets alpha -spending function for Pocock boundary conditions was planned to be conducted based on the accumulation of approximately 50 events of the total anticipated target number of 100 for the primary endpoint. For study 2019nCoV -301 two interim analyses for efficacy and futility were planned targeting a total of 144 cases. However, with the implementation of the blinded crossover, the placebo -controlled portion ended, and both interim analyses were removed in a protocol revision. The DSMB was unblinded and reviewed the distribution of PCR+ cases over the trial arms during the study. The requested DSMB minutes have been pr ovided. They provide sufficient reassurance that the timing of the interim analyses were not informed by knowledge on the efficacy of the vaccine by the DSMB. The amendment was made prior to the DSMB discussion and was therefore independently taken. In 201 9nCoV -302, the primary and secondary efficacy analyses was based on the PP -EFF and supported by ITT Analysis Sets whilst in 2019nCoV -301 t he primary analysis was conducted in the PP - EFF set supported by the FAS set. Further, the primary efficacy endpoint in 2019nCoV -301 was evaluated among the seropositive and seronegative participants in the PP -EFF2 set. The primary endpoint was analysed using modified Poisson regression, with a sensitivity analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model accounting for str atification factors. The primary hypothesis in both trials was to determine that the (multiplicity adjusted) lower bound of the confidence interval around the estimate of vaccine efficacy (100 x (1 - RR)) was above 30%. Presented statistical methods are generally considered acceptable. In study 2019nCOV -302 various strategies are applied on handling intercurrent events for each of the two proposed estimands, no estimand has been defined in study 2019nCoV -301. In addition, conventional terminology including per protocol analysis has also been used. The applicant clarified that as at the time of writing the protocol the estimand framework had not been fully implemented by all regulators globally, and it was later decided to introduce the estimand framework in the SAP . The applicant will provide supportive analysis in Q2 2022. Sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of potential informative censoring due to early unblinding for intention to receive an Emergency Use Authorization vaccine were planned. The effic acy of NVX - CoV2373 was planned to be explored in several subgroups, such as age, presence of underlying risk factors, ethnicity and race. In conclusion, overall, the design and conduct of the studies were appropriate and in line with the requirements as laid down in the Guideline on clinical evaluation of new Vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005) and the EMA considerations on COVID -19 vaccines approval. Overall primary and secondary efficacy objectives as defined in the phase 3 trials are of relevance to inform the efficacy of NVX- CoV2373. Baseline data CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 105/168 The disposition of study participants in the various analysis sets were generally well balanced across treatment gr oups. A reasonable proportion of participants was over 65 years of age (27%) in 2019nCoV -302, compared to 12.6% of the safety population of 2019nCoV -301. Study 2019nCoV -301 included participants up to 95 years of age whilst - 302 capped inclusion at 85 year s. Efficacy data and additional analyses Vaccine efficacy according to the primary efficacy endpoint was demonstrated for both pivotal trials. The inferential analysis at the interim analysis in 2019nCoV -302 indicated a VE point estimate of 89.3% with a multiplicity adjusted 96.9% CI of 73.0% to 95.8%, meeting the prespecified study success criterion of an alpha- adjusted LBCI > 30%. This interim was based on 62 accrued cases. VE was consistent in the final efficacy analysis after accrual of 106 cases, wit h an estimated VE of 89.7% (95%CI: 80.2, 94.6%). The final efficacy evaluation is based on a median follow -up of 90 days, limiting VE estimates to be applicable short- term. Longer -term vaccine efficacy remains currently unknown and will be further followed post-authorisation . Of the 106 cases, 4 were classified as severe (all in the placebo group). Of these, two were hospitalis ed. Pre- planned analyses assessing the sensitivity to model assumptions (Cox regression), missing data (tipping point analysis) as w ell as supportive analyses assessing different intercurrent event handling are planned by the applicant for 2022. An analysis taking into account overrunning cases not listed on the confirmed event list for the final analysis is also expected in 2022. A single final analysis was conducted in 2019nCoV -301, based on 77 cases with 14 in the NVX - CoV2373 group and 63 in the placebo group. The resultant estimated VE was 90.4% (95% CI: 82.9, 94.6), which is in line with the findings from 2019nCoV -302. This evaluat ion is based on a median follow up time of 76 days after the second dose of NVX -CoV2373. There were 4 severe cases including 3 hospitalisations due to COVID -19 among the 77 per -protocol COVID -19 cases in 2019nCoV -301 (all in the placebo group). Sensitivity analyses with Cox regression were consistent (VE: 90.4%), as well as the effect in adults regardless of serostatus at baseline. The latter is unsurprising considering the small proportion of participants who were seropositive, therefore no conclusions on efficacy in seropositive subjects can be drawn. Sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of potential informative censoring due to early unblinding for intention to receive an Emergency Use Authorization vaccine are planned for 2022. Both trials were cond ucted during a time that COVID -19 vaccines became available. 2019nCoV -302 was started earlier than 2019nCoV -301, September vs December 2020 respectively, and is therefore differently impacted by this. Although there was substantial unblinding in 2019nCoV -302, with one- third of participants unblinded to study vaccine assignment during the course of the study this was balanced between the groups (33.8% in the NVX -COV2373 group vs 35.4% in the placebo group). It is likely that the duration of follow -up is shor ter for selective groups who were eligible first to receive a n authorised vaccine through their national vaccination campaign, e.g. elderly and health care workers. However, as vaccine efficacy was fairly consistent across different risk groups and duratio n of follow -up is still relatively short, major impact is unlikely. In study 2019nCoV -301 there is an obvious imbalance in unblinding between the study arms, with more participants in the placebo group requesting unblinding (15.2% vs 23.4%). Overall, the percentage of unblinding is lower than in study 2019nCoV - 302, however, the implementation of the blinded crossover, offering NVX -COV2373 to all participants was much earlier in the conduct of the 2019nCoV - 301 study (4 months after study start) than it was in the - 302 study (6 months after study start). Further, a larger proportion of participants (3.2%) did not receive their second dose in the 2019nCoV -301 trial compared to 2019nCoV -302 (1.0%), with again more participants in the placebo group (3.2% vs 4.4%). Also, a larger proportion of participants in the placebo group discontinued the study (8.1% vs 13.9%). CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 106/168 A trend for increased requests for unblinding to treatment received in th e placebo arm compared to the NVX-COV2373 arm was observed for most clinical sites in study 2019nCoV -301, but not in study 2019nCoV -302. No obvious association between reactogenicity profile and request for unblinding has been observed, although this does not preclude that placebo recipients might still have been able to guess their treatment allocation, with potential impact on their behaviour (potentially impacting the risk of being exposed and reporting of symptoms and collection of endpoint data). To as sess whether potential unblinding had an impact on the reporting of symptoms and collection of endpoint data, the applicant was requested to provide per treatment arm an overview of the unscheduled surveillance visits, number of swabs taken, number of posi tive and negative tested cases. There were no major differences in acute illness visits in the active and placebo arm (8.3% vs 8.7% in 2019nCOV -301and 28% -302). The percentage of participants randomi sed who were tested and had a negative test result was comparable for the active and placebo arm (6.8% vs 6.6% in 2019nCOV - 301 and 5.0% and 4.7% in 2019nCOV -302), while as expected a difference was observed in the percentage of positive tests. This indicates that even though in study 301 there was some awareness of the treatment received, there were likely no major differences in risks of being exposed, reporting illness or tests taken over the study arms. It is unlikely that this severely biased the efficacy estimates. Sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of potential informative censoring due to early unblinding for intention to receive an Emergency Use Authorization vaccine were planned but have not been provided yet. Given that the lower bound of the confidence interval was far from the pre-specified null hypothesis, and based on the information provided, it is unlikely that it would change the conclusions. Sensitivity analysis are expected to be provided in Q2 2022. For both trials, cumulative incidence rates were increasing constantly after randomi sation in the placebo group but remained low in the vaccine group. These analyses show that the cases in the two groups start diverging around day 21, indicating no measurable efficacy before the administration of the second dose in both trials which is further supported by analyses considering the protection after a first dose. W ithin the trials the vaccine w as mostly given with a 3 -week interval. In those who received a second dose, the at least 50% received the vaccine between day 21 and 23. Therefore it is deemed appropriate that section 4.2 of the SmPC simply states that the 2 doses are recommended to be given with a 21- day interval. The vaccine was administered in the PP -EFF as early as day 14 up to day 60 in study 2019nCoV -301 and between day 16 and day 45 in study 2019nCoV -302, the IQR was 21 to 23 days for the ITT/FAS population in both trials. This information is reflected in sect ion 5.1 of the SmPC. There were insufficient severe cases (n=8) and hospitalised cases (n=5) or deaths (n=0) to reliably estimate the VE against more severe outcomes. In 2019nCoV -301, viral genetic sequences were available for 54 of 77 primary endpoint c ases in the PP-EFF. Of these, 44 cases had mutations that would identify them as a VOC or VOI, 6 in the NVX - CoV2373 group and 38 in the placebo group, suggesting that efficacy is maintained against circulating variants which included B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.4 29 (Epsilon) and B.1.526 (Iota). There were no cases due to the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant in either trial. In 2019nCoV -302, for the final analysis, 66 cases were characterised as B.1.1.7, and 29 as Wuhan, characterisation of 11 cases is unknown. Overall, efficacy was shown against the B.1.1.7 variant. Strain specific efficacy results should however be interpreted with caution given the low number of cases for individual strains (1 vs 28 for the Wuhan strain), and potential confounding due to differences in baseline characteristics or unknown confounding factors. In addition, subgroup analyses showed that vaccine efficacy is consistent across different risk groups, subjects with various underlying diseases and different demographic characteristics, although limited numbers in certain subgroups preclude strong conclusions. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 107/168 Further support for the efficacy of NVX- CoV2373 comes from trial 2019nCoV -501 which was conducted in South Africa and included both HIV -negative and HIV -positive participants. A total of 4 4 cases of symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 cases in serologically na\u00efve healthy HIV -negative and medically stable HIV -positive adult participants were accrued between 23 November and 30 December 2020 for the official event -driven analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (data extraction 18 January 2021), with 15 (1.11%) cases in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 29 (2.19%) cases in the placebo group. The estimated VE was 49.4% (95% CI: 6.1, 72.8). This is mainly driven by efficacy in HIV -negative pa rticipants, as efficacy in HIV -positive participants could not be established (overall VE - 16.0%, 95% CI - 182.5, 52.4). The complete analysis comprised of 147 cases, with 51 (3.6%) cases for NVX -CoV2373 versus 96 (7.1%) cases for placebo. The estimated VE was 48.6% (95% CI: 28.4, 63.1). With only few cases accrued in HIV -positive participants (10 in NVX -CoV2373 vs 8 in placebo), further evaluation of NVX -CoV2373 in HIV -positive persons would be relevant . The overall VE in this study is lower than what is ob served in study 2019nCoV -302 and -301, also when looking only at the HIV -negative population. Whilst this may be explained by the circulating variant (Beta), immunogenicity results of the participants enrolled in this study also point to a reduced immune r esponse after vaccination (measured against the Wuhan strain) compared to the response observed in 2019nCoV -302. As it is difficult to disentangle the relative contribution of the differences between the trials, it cannot be excluded that the lower VE is e xplained by more factors than the circulating virus variant alone, for example differences in baseline characteristics of the population enrolled or potential batch related issues. 2.6.7. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy Based on the data available for NVX -CoV2373, a robust and high protective efficacy against COVID -19 has been demonstrated in individuals aged 18 years and older in two pivotal observer blinded placebo controlled trials. Efficacy has been established for a median follow -up of 90 days in 2019nC oV-302 and 76 days in 2019nCoV -302. The vaccine is efficacious across different high -risk groups including older adults, as well as subjects considered at increased risk of severe disease due to underlying chronic disease. Lower vaccine efficacy was observ ed in a supportive trial 2019nCoV -501 in South Africa, which was possibly due to reduced efficacy against the B eta variant , however other factors cannot be excluded. No major objections regarding clinical efficacy have been identified. 2.6.8. Clinical safety Clinical safety was evaluated in the phase 1/2 trial 2019nCoV -101, phase 2 trial 2019nCoV -501 and the two pivotal phase 3 trials 2019nCoV -302 and 2019nCoV -301. Safety assessments include monitoring and recording of solicited (local and systemic reactogenicity events), unsolicited adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events of special interest (AESI), and vital sign measurements. Safety laboratory values (haematology and serum chemistry) were also evaluated in the first- in-huma n Clinical Study 2019nCoV -101 (Part 1). Solicited local and systemic adverse events were collected for 7 days after each vaccine dose. Grading of solicited adverse events was based on FDA Toxicity Grading Scale for Clinical Abnormalities. Unsolicited AEs w ere recorded from the time of first study vaccination until Day 49 after the initial set of vaccinations (i.e. 28 days post dose 2) in each trial, and for the entire study period in 2019nCoV - 301. SAEs, medical attended adverse events (MAAEs) and AESIs were assessed for the entire study period in all trials. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 108/168 AESIs included Potential Immune -Mediated Medical Conditions (PIMMCs) as well as events relevant to COVID -19. The investigator was to assess causality for all AEs and SAEs. AEs will be considered relate d if there is a reasonable possibility of relationship to study vaccine. The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study vaccine and cannot be reasonably explained by the participant's clinical state or other factors (e.g., disease under study, concurrent diseases, or concomitant medications), represents a known reaction to study vaccine or other vaccines in its class, is consistent with the known pharmacological properties of the study vaccine, and/or resolves with discontinuation of the study vaccine (and/or recurs with re -challenge, if applicable). The main presentations of data are based on the Safety Analysis sets from submitted clinical trials, including all subject data with supporting presentations to exclude the data post- unblinding/post - approved or deployed SARS -CoV-2 vaccine receipt . For 2019nCoV -301, incidence rates for AEs were presented to account for the imbalanced randomi sation and imbalanced follow up time between treatment arms. For other trials, numbers of events and % are reported. 2.6.8.1. Patient exposure Participants from two phase 3 studies ( 2019nCo V-301, 2019nCoV -302), -501) and one phase 1 study ( 2019nCoV -101 part 1) contribute d to the safety database for NVX -CoV2373. In total 30,058 subjects have been exposed to at least one dose of NVX -CoV2373 (5 ug rS /50 ug adjuvant), with 19,892 participants receiving a placebo. Of these, over 96% have received two doses. Table 26. Exposure of Participants in the Pooled Analysis of Safety Data In the phase 1 study, 134 subjects aged 18- 59 were randomised. Of these, 29 subject s received 2 doses of the final formulation (5 ug rS /50 ug adjuvant) and 54 subjects received at least 1 dose of 25 ug/50 ug vaccine formulation. In the phase 2 study 2019nCoV -101 (part 2), 1288 subjects were randomised, 1,283 participants received at leas t 1 dose of trial vaccine and 1,256 participants received both Dose 1 and Dose 2. Of these, 260 subjects received a single dose of NVX -CoV2373 (5 ug rS /50 ug adjuvant), 254 subjects received two doses. In addition, 251 subjects received two doses and 263 subjects received one dose of 25 ug/50 ug vaccine formulation (with a higher level of S -protein). The exposure in other phase 2 and 3 studies in presented in the table below. CHMP assessmen t report EMA/783213/2021 Page 109/168 Table 27. Exposure in phase 2 and phase 3 studies evaluat ing NVX -CoV2373 Target population Participants enrolled (NVX- CoV2373 / Placebo) Received 1 st dose (NVX - CoV2373 / Placebo) Received 2nd dose (NVX - CoV2373 / Placebo) Follow up time* (NVX-CoV2373 / Placebo) Date Cut Off 2,140/2,120 Median: in the interim CSRs submitted, from the second dose The median duration of follow -up in the pooled safety database was 70 days post -Dose 2, with 32,993 (66%) participants completing more than 2 months follow -up post -Dose 2. The shorter median duration of follow -up in the pooled data as compared to the indiv idual studies is due to censoring at unblinding. 2.6.8.2. Adverse events Solicited local reactions There were higher frequencies of solicited local AEs among NVX -CoV2373 recipients than among placebo recipients in all trials. An overview of solicited local AEs is p resented in Table 35 . In 2019nCoV -302, following the first dose, solicited local AEs were reported by 59.3% of NVX -CoV2373 recipients compared to 20.9% of placebo recipients. Following second dose the frequency of solicited local AEs in the NVX -CoV2373 gro up (80.2%) increased relative to the first vaccination (59.3%) and remained higher than in the placebo group (17.0%). Also, higher frequencies of grade 3 reactions were reported following the second dose, increasing from 1.1% to 5.2%. There was a slight in crease in the frequency and intensity of reactions following the second dose in persons who reported mild (grade 0, grade 1) reactions following the first dose; of persons reporting grade 1 reactions following the first dose approximately 50% reported grad e 2 or higher reactions following the second dose. Persons reporting moderate to severe reactions following the first dose tended to report similar or less severe reactions following the second dose. Tenderness and injection site pain were the most freque nt solicited local AEs, reported by 705 (54.9%) and 394 (30.7%) participants, respectively, after the first dose and by 922 (76.6%) and 624 (51.9%) participants after the second dose. Median durations of tenderness and pain increased with the second dose f rom 2.0 to 3.0 and 1.0 to 2.0 days respectively. A similar picture emerged in 2019nCoV -301 and 2019nCoV -101. In 2019nCoV -501 lower rates of local reactions were reported following the second dose compared to the first and they were less often severe. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 110/168 Table 28. Solicited Local Adverse Events for 7 Days Following Each Vaccination Across the SARS -CoV-2 rS Clinical Development Programme Solicited systemic reactions Overall, there were higher frequencies of solicited systemic AEs among NVX -CoV2373 recipients than among placebo recipients following each vaccination overall and in each age cohort. An overview of solicited systemic AEs after each dose across the clinical trials is presented in Table 29 CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 111/168 Table 29. Solicited Systemic Adverse Events for 7 Days Following Each Vaccination Across the SARS -CoV-2 rS Clinical Development Programme CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 112/168 In 2019nCoV -302, solicited systemic AEs were reported by 47.6% of NVX -CoV2373 recipients following the first dose. This increased with the second dose to 64.6%. With the second dose, higher frequencies of grade 3 reactions were reported, increasing from 1.3% with the first dose to 6.8%. There was a modest increase in the frequency and intensity of reactions with the second dose for those persons who experienced mild (grade 0, grade 1) reactions with the first dose. Of participants reporting grade 1 reactions with the first dose, 55% reported grade 2 or higher reactions following the second dose. Of participants who reported grade 3 or 4 reactions following the first dose, 60% reported less severe systemic reactions following the second dose. Headache, fatigue, and muscle pai n were the most frequent solicited systemic AEs. Grade 3 headache, fatigue, and muscle pain were reported in 17 (1.4%), 43 (3.6%), and 34 (2.8%) participants in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 3 (0.3%), 9 (0.8%), and 3 (0.3%) participants in the placebo group. M edian durations of headache, fatigue, and muscle pain were 1.0, 1.0, and 1.0 day in each study vaccine group after both the first as the second dose. Again, a similar systemic reactogenicity was observed in trials 2019nCoV -101 and 2019nCoV -301. In 2019nCoV -301, 0.1% reported grade 4 solicited systemic adverse events after the first and second dose in both vaccine arms. Following first vaccination in 2019nCoV -301, overall concomitant analgesic medication use was low (< 1%), and rates were balanced between th e NVX -CoV2373 and placebo groups (130 [0.7%] and 57 [0.6%], respectively). Following second vaccination, there was an increase in concomitant analgesic medication use in the NVX -CoV2373 group relative to the placebo group (545 [2.8%] and 63 [0.6%], respect ively). In 2019nCoV -302, following first vaccination, overall concomitant analgesic medication use was low (1.4%), and rates were balanced between the NVX -CoV2373 and placebo groups (100 [1.3%] and 112 [1.5%], respectively). Similar results were seen follo wing second vaccination (103 [1.4%] and 119 [1.6%], respectively). CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 113/168 Unsolicited adverse events There were higher frequencies of unsolicited AEs within the 49 days after first vaccination among NVX - CoV2373 recipients than among placebo recipients. Unsolic ited AEs were mostly mild, with severe TEAEs occurring in < 1% of participants. In 2019nCoV- 301, up to Day 49, higher rates of AEs in the NVX -CoV2373 group were reported for the following SOCs: 'General disorders and administration site conditions' (IR: 3 3.7 vs 16.8 per 100 PY) with differences in the PTs: Fatigue, Injection site pain, pain, pyrexia, chills, malaise, injection site pruritus, injection site erythema, Injection site swelling, influenza like illness, oedema peripheral (n=15 vs 4). Nervous sy stem disorders (IR: 18.7 vs 18.1 per 100 PY) with differences in PTs Headache (n=293 vs 130), Migraine (n=18 vs 3) 'Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders' (IR: 13.8 vs 11.8 per 100 PY), with a difference in PTs Myalgia (n=109 vs 30), Pain in extr emity subcutaneous tissue disorders' (IR: 7.9 vs 5.2), with a difference in the PTs Rash (n=61 vs 22), Prurit us (n=25 vs 2), Urticaria 'Blood and lymphatic disorders' (IR: 2. 8 vs 1.6), with a difference in the PT Lymphadenopathy (n=53 vs 13) 'Eye disorders' (IR: 2.3 vs 1.0) with 62 events reported in 51 of 19,729 (0.26%) participants receiving active vaccine compared with 13 events in 12 of 9,853 ( 0.12%) placebo -treated partic ipants. This explained by minor imbalances in several PTs including diplopia (notably, one SAE of diplopia was reported), dry eye, eye swelling, lacrimation increased, ocular discomfort, photophobia, and swelling of eyelid. Several of these PTs are related or can possibly be caused by inflammation of the eye although there was only a singular report in the PT 'Eye inflammation' (in the NVX -CoV2373 group). Reproductive system and breast disorders (IR: 2.00 vs 1.25) with 55 events reported in 52 of 19,729 (0.26%) participants receiving active vaccine compared with 17 events in 17 of 9,853 ( 0.17%) placebo -treated participants; the imbalance is explained by PTs of dysmenorrhoea (12 vs 3) and menstruation irregular (5 vs 0). There was a higher IR of uns olicited treatment- related AEs reported from start of first vaccination through 28 days after second vaccination (eg, Day 49) in the NVX -CoV2373 group (50.92 than (26.34 e/100 PY). Unsolicited treatment -related AEs that had e/100 PY higher IR in the NVX -CoV2373 group than in the placebo group were injection site pain (5.64 vs 2.35), fatigue (4.84 vs 2.72), headache (4.73 vs 3.31), pyrexia (2.76 vs 0.74), myalgia (2.76 vs 0.96), chills (1.86 vs 0.37), and injection si te pruritus (1.53 vs 0.15); these events were consistent with the solicited local and systemic TEAEs reported during the reactogenicity period. In 2019nCoV- 302, differences between the treatment arms were largely due to differences in AEs of pain (1.2% vs 0.3%, respectively), injection site pruritus (0.7% vs <0.1%), and lethargy (1.0% vs 0.4%). There was a higher frequency of participants with unsolicited treatment -related AEs in the NVX - CoV2373 group (10.9%) than in the placebo group (4.6%); this differen ce was largely due to treatment -related AEs of pain (1.1% vs 0.2%, respectively), influenza -like (0.8% vs (0.6% vs <0.1%), and lethargy (0.9% vs 0.3%). Considering the severe AEs in 2019nCoV -302, a numerical imbalance was seen for hypertension, with 9 reports of hypertension (0.1%) for the NVX -CoV2373 group compared with 2 for the placebo group (<0.1%), in addition to reports of blood pressure increased (n=2), systolic hypertension (n=1) and hypertensive crisis (n=1) in the group vs one report of pressure systolic CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 114/168 increased' in the placebo group (n=1). Combined 13 vs 3 severe TEAEs were reported related to hypertension. In the pooled analysis the incidence rates were 0.40 (n=102) in the NVX -CoV2373 a rm compared to 0.43 (n=70) in the placebo arm for participants 18- 64 years. In participants aged 65 or older however, the rates were 0.96 (n=46) in the NVX -CoV2373 arm compared to 0.64 (n=22) in the placebo group during the 3 days following vaccination . In 2019nCoV- 501, there was a similar rate of unsolicited AEs through 49 days after first vaccination in both vaccine arms. The most frequent (incidence > 1.0%) TEAEs in the NVX -CoV2373 group were headache (3.1%) and upper respiratory tract infection (1.2%); headache (2.3%) and influenza -like illness (1.1%) were the most frequent in the placebo group. The most frequent (incidence > 5 participants) treatment -related TEAEs in the NVX -CoV2373 group myalgia (9 [0.4%]), lymphadenopathy (9 [0.4%]), and injection site pain (6 [0.3%]). Adverse events of special interest Adverse events of special interest included potential immune- mediated medical conditions (PIMMCs) as well as adverse events related to COVID -19. PIMMCs were reported in 5 (<0.1%) participants in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 8 (0.1%) participants in the placebo group in 2019nCoV -302. There were no PIMMCs -101. there was a higher IR of PIMMCs reported from start of first vaccination to blinded crossover or End of Study in the NVX -CoV2373 group (0.40 e/100 PY]) than in the placebo group (0.15 e/100 PY). An overview of PIMMCs reported in 2019nCoV -301 is presented in Table 37.Table Apart from uveitis (n=3 reports) and Basedow's disease/hyperthyroidism (n=3), there was only a single report for the PTs listed with no clear patterns emerging aside from the overall imbalance. Table 30 . Overall Summary of Potential Immune-Mediated Medical Conditions Based on Protocol -Defined MedDRA Preferred Terms or Site Entered Criteria on the Case Report Form CHMP a ssessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 115/168 by System Organ Class and Preferred Term Reported from After Start of First Vaccination to Blinded Crossover or End of Study by Age Strata (Safety Analysis Set) Given findings in the interim data outputs, which suggested that investigators (and perhaps participants) thought they could surmise the treatment assignment, a broader analysis with r espect to PIMMCs was undertaken. A standard MedDRA query (SMQ) based on the protocol -defined PIMMC MedDRA preferred terms was applied to the data. This evaluation demonstrated no imbalance of PIMMCs between study groups. An overview of PIMMCs based on prot ocol-defined MedDRA preferred terms or site entered criteria on case report forms is provided in the table above. There were no SOCs that had a 0.05 e/100 PY higher IR in the NVX- CoV2373 group than in the placebo group. In 2019nCoV -302 similar frequencie s of participants reported protocol- defined AESIs relevant to COVID -19 between the NVX -CoV2373 and placebo groups, with AESIs reported in 8 (0.1%) participants in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 23 (0.3%) participants in the placebo group. Anosmia and ageusia we re the most frequently reported AESIs relevant to COVID -19, reported by 0.1% in the NVX - COV2373 group. In 2019nCoV -301, there was a numerically higher IR of AESIs relevant to COVID -19 CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 116/168 reported from start of first vaccination to blinded crossover or EoS in the placebo group (0.27 e/100 2019nCoV -501, few reports of AESIs related to COVID -19 through 49 days after first vaccination: 11 (0.5%) participants in the NVX - CoV2373 group and 14 (0.6%) pa rticipants in the placebo group. AESIs related to COVID -19 in the NVX-CoV2373 group were anosmia, cough, oropharyngeal pain, and pyrexia (3 [0.1%] each). 2.6.8.3. Serious adverse event s and deaths Deaths Three (<0.1%) participants died during study 2019nCoV -302, 2 in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 1 in the placebo group. In 2019nCoV -301, a total of 14 participants died during the study, with 9 (0.05%) in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 5 (0.05%) in the placebo group. Four deaths occurred in 2019nCoV - 501, with 2 deaths (unknown cause and COVID -19) in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 2 deaths (both COVID -19) in the placebo group. There were no deaths reported in 2019nCoV -101 (interim report). All deaths were assessed as not related to trial vaccine. An overview of deaths occurring within clinical trials is provided in Table 31 CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 117/168 Table 31 Incidence Rates of Death Events Reported from After Start of First Vaccinatio n Through the Respective Data Cutoff Dates of the Individual Clinical Trials in the Pooled Analysis of Safety Data Other serious adverse e vents The IRs of unsolicited SAEs reported from after the start of first vaccination through the respective data cu t-off dates for each individual study with an IR > 0.10 events per 100 person -years (e/100 PY) in any study group are presented in Table 39. SAEs occurred at a similar rate across both treatment groups, with slightly higher IRs among participants in the older age cohort ( 65 years of age). CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 118/168 Table 32 . Incidence Rates of Serious Adverse Events Reported from After Start of First Vaccination Through the Respective Data Cutoff Dates of the Individual Clinical Trials with an Incidence Rate > 0.10 e/100 PY in the Pooled Analysis of Safety Data CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 119/168 In 2019nCoV- 301 169 (0.86%) participants NVX -CoV2373 group reported 228 SAEs (IR: 4.32/100PY). There were 128 SAE reported in the placebo group (IR: 4.89/100PY). Two SAEs (angioedema and central nervous system inflammation) in the NVX -CoV2373 group were assessed by both the investigator and sponsor as being related to study vaccine. Three additional SAEs (Basedow's disease, hyperthyroidism, and thrombocytopenia) in the NVX -CoV2373 group were assessed by the investigator as related to study vaccine but were assesse d by the sponsor as not related to study vaccine. Also refer to AESIs. Other SAEs of interest in 2019nCoV -301 due to imbalances between the treatment arms or observations in other trials are: - There were 11 events of (acute) cholecystitis, bile duct stone, and cholelithiasis reported in nine subjects in the NVX -CoV2373 group and none in the placebo group - There were 6 events of prostate cancer in the NVX -CoV2373 group and none in the placebo group. These events occurred in 5 subjects - There were 7 events of c erebrovascular accident in the NVX -CoV2373 group and one in the placebo group. These events occurred in 8 subjects, including one in the placebo group There were 4 events of hypertension and 2 events of hypertensive crisis reported as an SAE in the NVX-CoV2373 group, and none in the placebo group. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 120/168 In 2019nCoV- 302, 44 (0.6%) participants in the NVX -CoV2373 group reported 54 SAEs vs 44 (0.6%) participants in the placebo group reporting 56 SAEs. One SAE of myocarditis in a 18- 29 year old study participant with no underlying risk factors was considered related to study vaccine by the investigator; TTO was 3 days post second vaccination. The event resolved. Further, there was an SAE of pulmonary embolism in a 50- 59 year old study participant with relevant risk fa ctors. TTO was 9 days after the second vaccination. The event was not considered related to vaccination by the investigator. In 2019nCoV- 501, a total of 11 (0.5%) participants reported 11 SAEs in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 18 (0.8%) participants reported 18 SAEs in the placebo group; none of these events in either group were assessed as related to trial vaccine. There were no SAEs reported in 2019nCoV-101 (Part 1) (D189 interim report). In study 2019nCoV - 101 (Part 2) 9 (0.7%) participants had a total of 9 SA Es, including an SAE of colitis occurring 2 days post second dose and assessed as not related by the Sponsor. 2.6.8.4. Laboratory findings Clinical laboratory findings were only reported for study 2019nCoV -101 (Part 1), where haematology and serum chemistry was par t of the safety assessments. Haemoglobin, haematocrit, platelet count, white blood cell count, alanine creatine were determined. FDA applied. Haematology: A total of 6 participa nts (4.6%) had post -baseline Grade 2 hematologic laboratory abnormalities: 1 in Group A [placebo/placebo], 1 in Group B [25/0 g \u00d7 2], 2 in Group C [5/50 g \u00d7 2], and 2 in Group E [25/50 g, Dose 1; placebo, Dose 2]. This included 5 participants (3.8%) w ith Grade 3 toxicity (1 in Group B; 2 in Group C; and 2 in Group E). All Grade 2 hematologic laboratory abnormalities comprised decreased haemoglobin, defined as > 20 g/L decreases from baseline. These events were predominantly transient in nature. Media n haemoglobin values decreased from baseline across the active vaccine and placebo groups following first vaccination at Day 7 and at Day 21 and following second vaccination at Day 28. Serum chemistry: A total of 2 participants (1.5%) had abnormal serum ch emistry laboratory values reported as TEAEs (liver function test increased in Group C and transaminases increased in Group D). Both events were mild in severity and assessed as related to active vaccine. A total of 10 participants (7.6%) had post -baseline Grade 2 serum chemistry abnormalities (1 in Group A [placebo/placebo], 1 in Group B [25/0 g \u00d7 2], 2 in Group C, 5 in Group D, and 1 in Group E [25/50 g, Dose 1; placebo, Dose 2]), which included 2 participants (1.5%) with Grade 3 toxicity (1 each in Gr oups C and E); no participant had a Grade 4 serum chemistry abnormality. Throughout the clinical trials, there were similar rates of laboratory investigation TEAEs for NVX - CoV2373 compared with placebo. TEAEs in most PTs were infrequent, with less than two events for most PTs in either the NVX -CoV2373 or placebo groups; there were no clear imbalances between the NVX-CoV2373 group and placebo. 2.6.8.5. Safety in special populations By sex CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 121/168 In the pivotal trial 2019nCoV -302, 51.6% of participants were male and 48.4% w ere female. In the pivotal trial 2019nCoV -301, 52.2% of participants were male, and 47.8% were female. In study 2019nCoV -501, 57.2% of participants were male and 42.3% were female. Subgroup analyses by sex were performed for solicited TEAEs in Clinical St udy 2019nCoV -301 and 2019nCoV -302. Male participants reported lower frequencies of solicited AEs among both NVX - CoV2373 and placebo recipients after each vaccination than in female participants. The difference between the rates in the NVX -CoV2373 and place bo groups for both males and females are very similar after dose 1 and dose 2 considering both local as well as systemic reactions. Solicited reactions by sex as observed in 2019nCoV -301 are presented in Table 33 (local) and Table 34 (systemic). Table 33 . Subgroup Analysis of Solicited Local Adverse Events within 7 Days after Dose 1 and Dose 2 by Sex (Safety Analysis Set, 2019nCoV-301) Table 34.Subgroup Analysis of Solicited Systemic Adverse Events within 7 Days after Dose 1 and Dose 2 by Sex (Safety Analysis Set, 2019nCoV-301) With regards to unsolicited AEs, including severe AEs, SAEs, MAAEs, and AESIs, there are no clear indications of a differential safety profile with relatively small, non -significant, differences in several SOCs detected but no consistent pattern emerging. Of note, where there are clearly higher rates of certain AEs in males vs females or vice versa this is mostly true for both the NVX -CoV2373 group as well as the placebo group. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 122/168 By underlying comorbidites In 2019nCoV -301, participants with co -morbidities of obesity, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2 reported lower frequencies and intensities of solicited local and systemic AEs after each vaccination among NVX -CoV2373 recipients than the overall study population who received NVX -CoV2373 and participants with chronic lung disease. The fr equencies and intensities in participants with chronic lung disease were similar as the overall study population. By Age Participants in the older age cohort ( 65 years of age) reported lower frequencies and intensities of solicited local and systemic AE s among NVX -CoV2373 recipients after each vaccination than in participants in the younger age cohort (18 to 64 years of age). An overview of adverse events reported in 2019nCoV -302 stratified by age is presented in Table 35. A similar pattern was observed in study 2019nCoV -301.

By serostatus at baseline In study 2019nCoV -501, negative baseline serostatus and positive baseline serostatus for SARS -CoV-2 were established, respectively, for 65.9% and 34.1% of participants. As can be seen in Table 45 rates of solicited and unsolicited adverse events were simil ar in subjects seropositive or seronegative at baseline. Similarly, in 2019nCoV -302 - where only 4.2% of participants was seropositive at baseline - there was no suggestion of an increase in reactions or TEAEs in seropositive persons vs seronegative person s.

A total of 137 pregnancies were reported in the clinical development program as of 26 October 2021. Of these participants, 95 received NVX - CoV2373 and 42 received placebo. Of the 95 pregnancies reported in participants in the NVX -CoV2373 group, 8 resulted in live births, 11 underwent voluntary termination, 16 resulted in spontaneous abortion, and 60 were either ongoing (55) or the outcome of the pregnancy was unknown (5). There were no f oetal deaths or stillbirths reported in the clinical development program. There are no data available on the safety of NVX -CoV2373 administered during breastfeeding. 2.6.8.6. Immunological events In order to evaluate the occurrence of potential hypersensitivity reactions following administration of the vaccine, the SMQ of Hypersensitivity (Narrow) was run across the pooled studies included in the Integrated Safety Summary (Studies 2019nCoV -101 Part 1, 2019nCoV -101 Pa 2019nCoV -501). Events occurring within the 3 days of vaccination were captured. Across the studies, 113 (0.38%) vaccine recipients compared to 42 (0.21%) placebo recipients reported AEs under the Hypersensitivity SMQ N arrow within the 3 days of vaccination, with a Risk Difference (RD) of 0.20 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.30). For the SOC Immune System Disorders, the frequency was higher for vaccine recipients (0.04%) than for placebo recipients (0.00%) with 8 (0.03%) recipients reporting of allergy to vaccine and 3 (< 0.01%) recipients reporting hypersensitivity. None of the three hypersensitivity events are considered related to NVX -CoV2373. None of the three hypersensitivity events are considered related to NVX - CoV2373. Upon revi ew of the narratives of the 8 reports of 'allergy to the vaccine', it was found that these were mostly reactogenicity related events rather than clear hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine. There was one case which may concern true hypersensitivity, namely an erythematous patch on the hand and itchiness as mild in intensity with onset 10 minutes after vaccination, which was resolved within 3 hours. No events of anaphylaxis have been reported. 2.6.8.7. Safety related to drug -drug interactions and other interactions Local and systemic reactions were higher in participants included in the Seasonal Influenza Substudy , who received concomitant influenza vaccine, than in participants who did not receive concomitant influenza vaccine. Following first dose, where concomitant influenza vaccination did occur, there was a higher frequency of solicited local AEs in the NVX -CoV2373 group who received concomitant influenza vaccine (70.1%) than in those who received only NVX -CoV2373 (57.6%). Systemic reactions were reported by 60.1% in the Seasonal Influenza Substudy, compared to 45.7% in those who did not receive concomitant infl uenza vaccine. Following second vaccination (where concomitant influenza vaccination did not occur), the frequency of solicited local AEs in participants in the Seasonal Influenza Substudy was 85.0%, compared to 79.6% in subjects not included in the Season al Influenza Substudy. Systemic reactions were reported by 69.7% compared to 64.0% respectively. 2.6.8.8. Discontinuation due to adverse events 2019nCoV-301 Study discontinuations due to adverse events were reported by a total of 24 subjects (0.1%), 17 (0.1%, 65 ev ents) in the NVX -CoV2373 arm and 7 (0.1%, 14 events) in the placebo arm. IRs of unsolicited TEAEs resulting in study discontinuation reported from start of first vaccination to blinded crossover or EoS with > 0.05 e/100 PY in the NVX -CoV2373 group was fati gue (0.06 vs 0). Adverse events resulting in vaccine discontinuation were reported by 57 (0.3%) subjects in the NVX -CoV2373 arm and 16 (0.2%) subjects in the placebo arm. 2019nCoV-302 TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were recorded for 27 (0.4%) of s ubjects in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 17 (0.2%) subjects in the placebo group. Treatment -related TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were reported in 14 (0.2%) subjects in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 3 (<0.1%) in the placebo group. The most frequent (incidence > 1 participant) treatment -related TEAEs leading to study discontinuation in the NVX -CoV2373 group were injection site pain (4 participants) and myalgia (2). CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 128/168 There were similar frequencies of participants reporting unsolicited TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study vaccine between the 2 study vaccine groups, with 30 (0.4%) participants in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 23 (0.3%) participants in the placebo group. 2019nCoV-501 Unsolicited TEAEs resulting in vaccine discontinuation were reported in 0 of 2 ,211 participants in the NVX-CoV2373 group versus 1 (< 0.1%) of 2,197 participants in the placebo group; 4 (0.2%) of 2,211 participants in the NVX -CoV2373 group and 4 (0.2%) of 2,197 participants in the placebo group reported TEAEs resulting in study disco ntinuation . 2.6.9. Discussion on clinical safety Methods Safety data was collected in 4 studies conducted in Australia, the US, South Africa, the UK and Mexico. A pooled analysis of safety data from these studies has been presented, including data from the first vaccination up to the data cut-off, blinded cross over or study unblinding. Methods for the collection and reporting of safety data appear largely appropriate. There is an apparent different pattern in reactions as observed in study 2019nCoV -501 compared to studies -301 and - 302. In 2019nCoV -501 lower rates of local and systemic reactions were reported, and the rates were reduced following the second dose compared to the first. Further, reactions were less often severe as compared to the other clinical trials. As the reason for the discrepancy between the studies in reporting is not clear, the rates of reactions as presented in the SmPC has been based on 2019nCoV -301 and 2019nCoV -302 and does not consider the data of study 2019nCoV -501. It is however anyhow considered that pivotal studies - 302 and - 301 are sufficiently large and of adequate methodology to characterise the reactogenicity profile. Of note, the reactogenicity subset in study - 302 included participants who received concomitant influenza vaccine. This is considered acceptable as it is a conservative approach: participants who received concomitant influenza vaccine reported more reactions (approximately 10 -15% hi gher rates of local reactions). Solicited AEs were collected for 7 days post dose 1 and post dose 2. Unsolicited AEs were collected up to 28 days after the second dose, with the exception of SAEs, MAAEs and AESIs which were collected during the entire study period, which was considered appropriate. Exposure At the time of the analysis, a total of 49,950 participants age 18 years and older received at least one dose of NVX -CoV2373 (n=30,058) or placebo (n=19,892). Over 96% of participants have received two doses. Median exposure from the second dose was 90 days in study 2019nCoV -302 and 76/77 days in the NVX -CoV2373 and placebo group respectively in study 2019nCoV -301, with 66% of participants completing at least 2 months follow -up. The median duration of follow -up in the pooled safety database was 70 days post -Dose 2. The shorter median duration of follow -up in the pooled data as compared to the individual studies is due to censoring at unblinding. Adverse Events Reactogenicity was evaluated in 1,364 participants who received a first dose and 1,348 participants who received a second dose of NVX -CoV2373 in study 2019nCoV -302, and 19,729 participants who received a first dose and 17,139 participants who received a second dose of NVX -CoV2373 in study 2019nCoV -301. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 129/168 In both studies, there were more solicited local and systemic reactions reported by participants in the NVX-CoV2373 group compared to placebo, with the frequency and intensity of reactions increasing with the second dose compared to the first. Pain and tenderness were the most commonly reported local reactions in both study 2019nCov -302 as study 2019nCov -301. Pain was reported by 34% after the first dose of NVX -CoV2373 and 59% after the second dose. Tenderness was reported by 53% post dose 1 and 74% post dose 2. In the placebo group rates were between 11% and 17% and did not increase with the second dose. Local reactions were mostly mild to moderate, with 1.1% of participants in the NVX -CoV2373 group reporting grade 3 local reactions after the first dose in either study and 6.6% after the second dose. Local reactions pain and tenderness had a median duration of 1 to 2 days after the first dose and 2 to 3 days after the second dose. Headache, fatigue, and muscle pain were the most frequent solicited systemic AEs , reported by 25%, 25%, and 23% post dose 1 compared to 23%, 22%, and 13% in the placebo group respectively, and by 44%, 49%, and 48% post dose 2 compared to 19%, 21%, and 12% in the placebo group. The median duration of headache, fatigue and muscle pain was 1 day after each dose in both studies. For GI reactions (nausea/ vomiting), after the first dose rates are comparable between the NVX -CoV2373 group and the placebo group, ho wever with the second dose reported nausea/vomiting doubled in the vaccine group. Fever was reported infrequently, but again increased substantially with the second dose in the NVX - CoV2373 group (in study - 302 from 2.3% to 5.1%, in - 301 from 0.4 to 5.7%). Overall, concomitant analgesic medication use was low, varying from < 1% to 3% depending on study and dose. Systemic reactions were mostly mild with 1.3% -2.3% reporting grade 3 systemic reactions after the first dose, and 6.8%- 12.0% reporting grade 3 systemic reactions following the second dose. Grade 4 reactions were reported by 0.1% in study 2019nCov -301. Unsolicited AEs There were higher frequencies of unsolicited TEAEs within the 49 days after first vaccination (28 days after the second dose) amon g NVX -CoV2373 recipients than among placebo recipients overall (23.8% vs 18.7% in study - 302 and 16.3% vs 14.8% in - 301). The imbalance between the NVX -CoV2373 group and the placebo group in study 2019nCoV -302 was mainly driven by the SOC of general disord ers and administration site conditions (n=438, 5.8%, vs n=191, 2.5%). Also, there were more cases of lethargy (SoC: Nervous system disorders) reported in the NVX -CoV2373 group (n=77 (1.0%) vs n=29 (0.4%)). A observed in study 2019nCoV -301 and 2019nCoV -501. In the clinical trials there is a signal of increased risk of hypertension following NVX -CoV2373 as compared to the placebo group. There was an imbalance in severe cases of hypertension in trial 2019nCoV -302 where 13 vs 3 severe TEAEs w ere reported related to hypertension as well as four events of hypertension and hypertensive crisis reported as an SAE in the NVX -CoV2373 group, compared to 1 in the placebo group. No further information is available on the severity of reported events nor on the duration. There was no standardi sed assessment of hypertension in the trials, and there is limited information on the episodes of hypertension or worsening of hypertension reported. Further, it is unclear if an AE of hypertension was accompanied by measurement of the blood pressure (BP) at multiple timepoints or reflects an increase at a single timepoint. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the potential impact of the observed increased risk for vaccinees and whether there is any cause for con cern. With regards to a mechanism, hypertension could be related to anxiety surrounding the vaccination (in which case similar rates would be expected in the placebo group) or possibly related to an inflammatory reaction to the vaccine. Despite these limitations it is deemed relevant to inform CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 130/168 prescribers of the increased risk as observed in the clinical trials and based on the higher incidence in the NVX -CoV2373 vaccinated participants, which was included in the table of ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Fu rther, more information should be actively collected by the participant to further characterise the risk of hypertension following vaccination either through monitoring of BP in older adults still to be vaccinated in ongoing trials or through prospective o bservational studies in persons at risk of hypertension, where close and consistent monitoring of blood pressure can take place . There were no relevant imbalances or signals with regards to Adverse Events of Special Interest in studies -2019nCov -302, 2019n Cov-501, and 2019nCov -101, however in study 2019nCov -301 there was an increase in the incidence of PIMMCs reported in the NVX -CoV2373 group. The type of events reported are diverse, with no clear patterns emerging aside from the overall imbalance. Whilst exploring this signal, the applicant conducted a MedDRA SMQ which identified additional events in both treatment groups not reported by investigators. This analysis did not suggest an imbalance. In addition, the applicant provided a review of PIMMMCs in dif ferent SOCs based on the entire clinical safety database. In the SOCs of Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders, Eye Disorders and Endocrine Disorders there is a risk difference suggesting increased risk in the NVX -CoV2373 group however differences are sma ll, there is no clear association with a single PT, and therefore these imbalances may be due to chance. Where background rates are available, the observed cases do not seem to be higher although no adequate analysis comparing rates following vaccination w ith expected background rates was submitted. The clinical trial data from 2019nCoV -301 provide a suggestion of a higher risk of AEs related to inflammation of the eye following vaccination with NVX -CoV2373. This increased risk is not detected in other tria ls and is based on small numbers; therefore, it is not clear whether it is indeed related to NVX-CoV2373. It is considered that the reporting of AEs related to eye inflammation, including but not limited to in the Monthly Safety Summary Reports/PSURs. In 2019nCoV -301 also show an increased reporting of AEs in the SOC of Reproductive and breast disorders, which is explained by imbalances in PTs of dysmenorrhoea (12 vs 3) and menstruation irregular (5 vs 0). As there were no adverse events reported in relation to these PTs in study - 302, and as there is no clear pattern in time to onset and factors in the medical history that may have contributed, it is not clear based on the available evidence whether NVX -CoV2373 may be related to these events. Therefore, it is recommended that menstrual disorders are followed in the MSSRs/PSURs. Deaths and other serious adverse events There were 3 death s in study 2019nCoV -302, 13 deaths in - 301, and 4 deaths in - 501. None were considered related to study vaccine. Whilst it is agreed that none of the deaths are related to study vaccine, there were two deaths due to COVID -19 pneumonia in the vaccine group. Onset of symptoms was 8 days and 19 days after the first dose. There were no imbalances in SAEs between the vaccine groups in study 2019nCoV -302 or 2019nCoV - 501. In study 2019nCoV -301, there are imbalances between the treatment groups in the report ing of SAEs. There were numerically more SAEs in the SOC of Hepatobiliary Disorders, mainly driven by events related to cholecystitis (9 vs 0). Further, there were more events of prostate cancer (5 vs 0), cerebrovascular accident (7 vs 1) and hypertension/ hypertensive crisis (6 vs 0) in the NVX -CoV2373 treatment group. Differences remain when incidence rates were compared therefore the longer duration of follow up time due to higher levels of unblinding in the placebo group do not fully explain the imbalanc es. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 131/168 The mechanism behind vaccine induced cholecystitis occurring within a relatively short timeframe after vaccination is unclear although may be attributable to the activation of the inflammatory system. All cases of cholecystitis were in participants wi th underlying risk factors (e.g. female, gallstones, obese). There was no consistent pattern in time to onset in the reported cases, varying from 6 to 64 days after the last dose. Further, the data presented by the applicant suggest a relatively high background rate although the number of cases expected within the clinical trials is unclear. As there is a numerical imbalance between the vaccine and placebo group, and as all cases are considered serious, although there is currently insufficient evidence to c onclude that cholecystitis is possibly related to NVX - CoV2373 the recommendation is to follow cholecystitis in the MSSRs/PSURs. Considering the short latency between the diagnoses of prostate cancer, the presence of underlying risk factors, the absence of biological plausibility and the number of cases observed being within the expected cases based on background rates, 'prostate cancer' is unlikely related to NVX -CoV2373. The events of ' cerebrovascular accident' occurred in participants with pre -existing medical conditions were known risk factors for stroke, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, tobacco abuse, hyperlipidaemia, atrial fibrillation, recent myocardial infarction, and obesity. There was no clear pattern in the time between last vaccine dose and onset of symptoms. Despite the absence of any clear indication that the observed cases were related to the vaccine and any clear indication of an increased risk of CVA and/or related conditions with NVX -CoV2373, due to the imbalance between the two groups in 2019nCoV -301 it is recommended that CVA and related conditions are monitored in the MSSRs/PSURs. In study - 302, an SAE in the NVX -CoV2373 group of myocarditis was considered related to study vaccine by the investigator, in a 18- 29 yoa s tudy partic ipant with no relevant risk factors. Important to note that a viral aetiology cannot be excluded based on the available information . A further four cases were identified during the vaccination cross over period, including two cases of pericarditis. For two cases - an event of myocarditis and an event of myocarditis/pericarditis - considering the TTO, a relation is possible although here potential confounders are present which could provide an alternative explanation (strep throat, viral syndrome and the lat ter preceding lower respiratory tract infection with elevated WBC and CRP). It will be important to carefully monitor and assess the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis following vaccination and it should be included as an important potential risk in the Safe ty Specifications of the Risk Management Plan (RMP). Laboratory values Clinical laboratory findings were only reported for study 2019nCoV -101 (Part 1), where haematology and serum chemistry was part of the safety assessments. According to the protocols of studies 2019nCOV -101 (Part 2), - 302 and - 501 it appears that the effects of vaccination on clinical laboratory values (i.e. haematology, serum chemistry) has not been evaluated within these studies. There were similar rates of laboratory investigation TEA Es for NVX -CoV2373 compared with placebo. TEAEs in most PTs were infrequent, with less than two events for most PTs in either the NVX -CoV2373 or placebo groups; there were no clear imbalances between the NVX -CoV2373 group and placebo. Safety in special populations Overall, 47.4% (n=14232) of NVX -CoV2373 recipients in the clinical trials were female and 52.7% (n=15826) were male. Therefore, both sexes are sufficiently represented. There were no relevant differences in the safety profile of NVX -CoV2373 in fem ale and male participants. Whilst higher rates of solicited adverse events were reported by females compared to males, with females reporting approximately 5- 10% more solicited reactions after dose 1 and dose 2, this is observed in the NVX - CoV2373 group as well as the placebo group which may indicate that the increased reporting in females is not vaccine related. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 132/168 Available data does not suggest that baseline serostatus impacts the reactogenicity (frequency of solicited AEs) or safety of NVX -CoV2373 with very similar rates of treatment emergent solicited and unsolicited AEs reported in both participants seropositive as well as seronegative at baseline. There is no clear pattern of a differential safety profile of NVX -CoV2373 by HIV status. Although there is a suggestion of less reactions in HIV -positive participants, this may also be due to age which is known to affect reactogenicity. HIV -negative participants had a median age of 27 years, compared to 38 years in HIV -positive participants. Medically attended AEs were reported more often in HIV positive participants (2.9%) compared to HIV -negative participants (0.9%), at a similar frequency in the placebo as the NVX -CoV2373 group. Participants with co- morbidities of obesity, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascu lar disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2 reported lower frequencies and intensities of solicited local and systemic AEs after each vaccination among NVX -CoV2373 recipients compared to the overall study population as well as participants with chronic lung disease. Considering older adults participating in the trials, reactogenicity was markedly lower in those aged 65 - 84 years of age compared to those 18- 64 years of age. Frequencies of unsolicited AEs were similar in older adults compared to those aged 18- 64 years of age, with no difference in related adverse events or serious adverse events. There is a potentially higher rate of medically attended AEs in older adults, however this is consistent between the two treatment groups and may be reflective of differ ent health care seeking behaviour in this demographic rather than a different safety profile of NVX -CoV2373. There is limited clinical data in pregnant women, with 95 pregnancies reported in the clinical trials of which the majority (60) were still ongoing at the time of reporting. There were no stillbirths or f oetal deaths. There are no data available on the safety of NVX -CoV2373 administered during breastfeeding. Preclinical data show no effect of NVX -CoV2373 on the reproductive or developmental parameters. Therefore, no safety issues of use during pregnancy are foreseen. Furthermore, there is no reason to assume that constituents of NVX -CoV2373 will be excreted in breast milk. It is to be expected that anti-SARS- COV2 antibodies elic ited by NVX -CoV2373 will be excreted in the colostrum, which may contribute to the protection of the newborn child. Safety related to drug -drug interactions and other interactions Concomitant administration with influenza vaccine increased reporting of solicited AEs relative to when NVX-CoV2373 was administered without influenza vaccine. This is reflected in the SmPC. Immunological events No events of anaphylaxis have been reported though this likely reflects the rarity of this event in relationship to the size of the pre- authorisation safety database for the vaccine. Discontinuation due to AES In general, there were few discontinuations (vaccination/study) due to treatment emergent adverse events. Whilst none of the studies showed an imbalance in the study discontinuations due to AEs per study group, in - 301 more events were reported by those that discontinued the study due to AEs in the NVX-CoV2373 group. Further, in both pivotal s tudies a slightly higher proportion of participants discontinued the vaccination with the imbalance mostly due to reactions to the vaccine (i.e. headache, injection -site pain, myalgia). 2.6.10. Conclusions on the clinical safety Overall, the safety profile of Nuva xovid is adequately characterised and appears to be acceptable. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 133/168 2.7. Risk Management Plan 2.7.1. Safety concerns The applicant has submitted an RMP including the following summary of safety concerns: Summary of safety concerns Important identified risks None Important potential risks Anaphylaxis Vaccine -associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine - associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) Myocarditis and p ericarditis Missing information Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding Use in immunocom promised patients Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders Use in frail patients with comorbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) Interaction with other vaccines Long-term safety Risks considered important for the inclusion in the summary of safety concerns Important potential risk Anaphylaxis , although very rare, it can be life -threatening or fatal , requiring immediate medical attention. The risk of anaphylaxis after all vaccines is estimated to be 1.31 per million vaccine doses. Events of anaphylaxis have been reported with other COVID -19 vaccines. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. There were no reports of anaphylaxis in the NVX -CoV2373 clinical development programme. One event of angioedema was reported and was considered as related to the vaccine. Anaphylaxis can manifest clinically with dyspnea, hypotension, swelling (sometimes leading to airway compromise), and rash, and may be life threatening. Vaccine -associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine -associated enhan ced respiratory disease (VAERD): Vaccine -associated enhanced disease (including VAERD) may present as severe disease or modified/unusual clinical manifestations of a known disease presentation and may involve one or multiple organ systems. Subjects with VA ED/VAERD may experience rapid clinical deterioration and will likely require non -invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation; and patients diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have poorer prognosis and potentially higher mortality rate . No cases have been reported at the moment in the current NVX -CoV2373 clinical development. Myocarditis and pericarditi s: Myocarditis and pericarditis are events which may be serious or non - serious and are generally mild but may be potentially life threatening. Balanced with the risk of death and illness (including myocarditis) seen with COVID -19 itself, the impact on the benefit -risk balance of the vaccine is considered minimal. Two cases of myocarditis were reported following exposure to NVX - CoV2373 and one case was reported following exposure to placebo. In the post -crossover phase of the CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 134/168 studies 301 and 302, three cases of myocarditis were reported. In one case, myocarditis was reported with temporal association to NVX -CoV2373. In the absence of a lternative aetiologies, a causal association with the vaccine cannot be excluded in this case. For the other cases, alternativ e explanations that could explain the event have been reported. Considering that myocarditis and pericarditis has been observed fo llowing other COVID -19 vaccines, it is considered that there is a scientific basis for suspicion of a causal relation, although this is not confirmed. It should be listed as important potential risk. Missing information Use in pregnancy and while breastf eeding: Pregnant and breastfeeding women are typically excluded from initial clinical trials. There is limited experience with use of NVX -CoV2373 in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy , embryo/foetal development, parturition, or post- natal development. Administration of Nuvaxovid in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus. It is unknown whether Nuvaxovid is e xcreted in human milk. No effects on the breast -fed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast -feeding woman to Nuvaxovid is negligible. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reprodu ctive toxicity. Use in immunocompromised patients: Immunocompromised individuals are at greater risk of morbidity and mortality from vaccine -preventable disease. In addition, vaccines may be less effective in severely immunocompromised patients, as the vac cinees weakened immune system may not mount a sufficient response. Although there is no evidence that the safety profile of this population receiving NVX - CoV2373 will be different to that of the general population, the possibility cannot be excluded. Use in frail patients with comorbidities (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) : Frail (unstable) patients with comorbidities are at risk of developing a more severe manifestation o f COVID -19. Although there is no evidence that the safety profile of this population receiving NVX -CoV2373 will be different to that of the general population, the possibility cannot be excluded. Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders : There is limited information on the safety of the vaccine in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. There is no evidence from NVX - CoV2373 clinical studies to date that the safety profile of this population differs with that of the general population. However, given the paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded. Interaction with other vaccines : The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of NVX- CoV2373 when co - administered with another vaccine (i.e., with seasonal illness vaccines [such as the influenza vaccines]) was evaluated in approximately 400 persons in the UK Phase 3 study. The binding antibody response to SARS CoV- 2 was lower when NVX -CoV2373 was given concomitantly with inactivated influenza vaccine. The clinical signi ficance of this is unknown. Long-term safety : Given the nature of the NVX -CoV2373 clinical development programme, understanding of the long -term safety profile of NVX -CoV2373 is currently limited. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 135/168 Risks not considered important for inclusion in the sum mary of safety concerns The reactogenicity is in line with what can be expected from a vaccine, and it is considered acceptable to not include those events in the list of safety specifications. Vaccination errors may relate to administration, vaccination s cheme, storage conditions, or errors associated with multidose vials. Furthermore, there is potential for confusion or interchangeability with other COVID -19 vaccines. These potential vaccination errors are mitigated through a number of routine risk minimisation measures, including product information, vaccination reminder cards and medical information contacts. Adverse Events of Special Interest : The List of AESI is drawn from efforts by regulatory authorities, internationally recognis ed collaborations, a nd the scientific literature to identify for vaccinations, and COVID -19 vaccinations specifically. NVX of AESIs is provided in the RMP . Conclusions on the safety specification It is agreed that the list of safety concerns in the RMP are appropriate. 2.7.2. Pharmacovigilance plan Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities The applicant will follow standard pharmacovigilance processes, along with the additional actions referenced in the EU -RMP. Signal detection and other routine pharmacovigilance a ctivities The detection of signals described in the NVX -CoV2373 Pharmacovigilance Signaling System (PvSS) plan involves qualitative and quantitative pharmacovigilance methods. The primary data sources for signal detection and the minimum frequency of revie w are outlined below. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 136/168 Activity/Data Source Frequency of Review Qualitative Data Review ICSR (Individual Case Safety Report) medical review of serious cases Each business day Review of signal notifications Each business day Literature review of EMBASE including Medline Weekly Line listing review of adverse event reports from the safety database Weekly SMQs (MedDRA [Medical Dictionary tor Regulatory Activities] queries) and targeted PT searches Weekly Review of Novavax's p ost-authorisation Safety Database, including all spontaneous and solicited ICSRs, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Eudravigilance Data Analysis System (EVDAS), and other regulatory databases, as required ** Weekly US Vaccine Adv erse Event Reporting System (VAERS) disproportionality comparisons* Bi-weekly Monitoring (eRMR)* ** Bi-weekly Aggregate review of Novavax's Clinical Trial Database Monthly Batch trend analysis Monthly Review of Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) recommendations on signals** Monthly Quantitative Data Review Trends over time/frequency analysis Weekly Disproportionality analysis using EVDAS Bi-weekly Disproportionality analysis using VAERS Bi-weekly Observed versus expected (O/E) analysis Monthly * Applicable once Novavax post -authorisation database reaches a threshold number of ICSRs. ** Applicable once product is authori sed in the EU. Monthly Summary Safety Reports (MSSRs) In line with EMA's 'Consideration on core requirements for RMPs of COVID -19 vaccines' guidance, the applicant will submit monthly safety reports containing a review of safety information received during the reporting interval, as well as cumulative data. Topics covered by the monthly summary safety reports will include, at a minimum: Interval and cumulative number of reports overall and stratified by age groups, report type (medically confirmed vs. non -medically confirmed), seriousness, and in special populations (e.g. , pregnant women) Interval and cumulative number of reports per HLT and SOC Reports per EU country Exposure data based on administered doses whenever possible, stratified by region (and within the EU also by country), by age groups, gender, by first vs. second dose Safety- related changes to the reference safety information and actions taken in the interval List of ongoing and closed signals in the interval, including a summary of their evaluation; reviews of signals identified during the period or of safety topics identified by EMA and requested to be addressed in the MSSR CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 137/168 Summaries of reported cases of all AESIs and RMP safety concerns: report numbers and relevant cases, including O/E analysis (when possible) Fatal reports - numbers and relevant cases (co nsidering co -morbidities and frailty), including O/E analyses (when possible), stratified by age groups. Medication errors, if a pattern of errors leading to harm is identified and/or risk minimisation activities are considered warranted Details of the search strategy, case definitions, and methodology for O/E analyses including source of background rates, risk windows, etc., as needed Benefit -risk considerations In addition, based on the impurity levels , the applicant should monitor the r eactogenicity profile for the secondary dose and for future potential booster injections via routine pharmacovigilance, including the provision of updates as part of the MSSR. Following the safety clinical assessment of the conditional marketing authorisation, the following events are to be reviewed via routine pharmacovigilance in the MSSR/PSUR: menstrual disorders, cholecystitis, cerebrovascular accidents and related conditions and adverse events related to eye inflammation, including but not limited to u veitis, iridocyclitis, iritis, lacrimation facilitate the traceability of the use of this vaccine, the SmPC includes instructions for HCPs to record the name and batch number of the administered vaccine for each recipient. Traceability is available for every shipping container of COVID -19 vacci ne, which are outfitted with a unique device that provides real -time monitoring of geographic location and records temperature 24 hours per day, 7 days per week while in transit. Each device will also trace the batch/lot of the associated shipment. The dev ice is activated prior to shipment and information is transmitted wirelessly to Novavax at a predefined cadence, until delivery to the customer. A shipment quality report that indicates if the product is acceptable for immediate use is generated by Novavax and transmitted to the vaccinator's practice site upon pressing of the stop button on the data logger, or arrival notification from the carrier in combination with the data logger's location and/or light signal. Additionally, alarms and escalation/notific ation for excursions (per pre -defined specifications) are programmed into the device. The carton, which is the lowest saleable unit of the product, is assigned a unique serial number that is linked to information about the product's origin, batch number an d expiration date. Each carton contains the product global trade identification number (GTIN), serial number, lot/batch number, and expiry date printed human readable information and a scannable GS1 2D DataMatrix code. Further, vaccination reminder card s will be available to member states, if requested, for use by member state vaccinators at the time of vaccination. The vaccination reminder cards contain the following elements: Placeholder space for the vaccinee name; Placeholder space for the name of th e vaccine (brand name) and manufacturer of the vaccine; Placeholder space for the batch/lot number of the vaccine; Placeholder space for the date the vaccine was administered; CHMP assessment re port EMA/783213/2021 Page 138/168 A reminder to return for the second dose of the vaccine; Placeholder spaces for the second dose of the vaccine including the name of the vaccine/manufacturer of the vaccine, batch number, and date of the second dose of the vaccine; Novavax website and QR code that links to NovavaxCovidVaccine.com; and Information on AE reporting to th e member state local health authorities. In addition to the vaccination reminder cards, traceability labels (two labels per dose) containing product identifier (brand name) and batch/lot information as human readable and GTIN, batch/lot information and exp iration date encoded in GS -1 compliant 2 -D data matrix will be made available to support documentation of the batch/lot traceability on the vaccination reminder card and for use in the vaccinee's medical records. We also acknowledge that some EU member sta tes may require utilisation of nationally mandated vaccination cards or electronic systems to document batch/lot number; therefore, the available traceability and vaccination reminder cards and/or stickers with printed lot/batch information may not be util ised in all member states. Specific AE follow -up forms for the following safety concerns: Two specific adverse reaction follow up questionnaires will be used to collect follow -up information on reports of anaphylaxis and Vaccine -associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine - associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) Additional pharmacovigilance activities The applicant proposes the following 10 studies to further evaluate safety and effectiveness, and to address missing information in th e post -marketing setting.

Conclusion The CHMP and the PRAC considers that the risk management plan version 1 is acceptable. Pharmacovigilance 2.7.5. Pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 2.7.6. Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 2.8. New Active Sub stance The active substance is defined as the protein product of a recombinant SARS -CoV-2 S-gene encoding the 1260 (full length 1273 amino acid protein minus the signal peptide) amino acid spike protein (company code NVX -CoV2373). Information has been prov ided on the chemical formula, relative molecular mass, and structural formula/ amino acid sequence of the SARS -CoV-2 rS protein. Keyword and sequence searches were conducted in established databases and no relevant patent literature was identified that des cribes the SARS -CoV-2 recombinant spike protein. Details about the searches performed are provided, using keyword -based searches and sequence- based searches. The applicant has provided sufficient evidence that the quality aspects of NVX -CoV2373 are unique and that collectively, the information provided support the claim that the SARS- CoV-2 recombinant spike protein included as active substance in Nuvaxovid can be considered a s a New Active Substance in itself. In conclusion, t he active substance NVX -CoV2373, i.e. the protein product of a recombinant SARS - CoV-2 S-gene encoding the 1260 (full length 1273 amino acid protein minus the signal peptide) amino acid spike protein, contained in the medicinal product Nuvaxovid can be cons idered a biological substance not previously authorised in a medicinal product in the European Union, i.e. it is considered a New Active Substance in itself. 2.9. Product information 2.9.1. User consultation A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable, given the current urgent public health need for rapid development and approval of vaccines to prevent the global burden of disease associat ed with SARS- CoV-2 infection and COVID -19 disease, and because the product will CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 150/168 always be administered by a healthcare professional. The applicant is expected to thoroughly review and update the package leaflet in the light of the results from the user tes ting, especially as regards the section 'Information about storage and handling'. 2.9.2.

Quick Response (QR) code A request to include a QR code in the labelling and the package leaflet for the purpose of providing information to Healthcar e Professionals and vaccine recipients has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by all EU MSs, including Norway and Iceland . The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code: Statutory information: Approved regulatory information, including the patient information leaflet (PIL) and Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC); Vaccination Card. 2.9.4. Additional monitoring Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Nuvaxovid (COVID -19 Vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) ) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU and it is approved under a conditional marketing authoris ation. Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 3. Benefit -Risk Balance 3.1. Therapeutic Context 3.1.1. Disease or condition The claimed indication for Nuvaxovid is active immunisation of individuals 18 years of age for prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19). COVID -19 is a respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS -CoV-2. The virus has spread world -wide during 2020 causing WHO to declare a pandemic in March 2020. The virus infects the airways and causes a broad spectrum of respiratory symptoms ranging from asymptomatic infection to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and ARDS. The pandemic is still ongoing despite unprecedented effort s to control the outbreak. 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need At the time of authorisation of this vaccine , five medicinal products had received marketing authorisation for the treatment of COVID -19. These encompass antiviral therapy (remdesivir), anti- inflammatory therapy (dexamethasone), IL -6 inhibitor (toculizumab) as as monoclonal (casirivimab regdanvimab and submitted for anakinra, baricitinib (both anti -inflammatory agents), as well as the direct acting antiviral drug molnupiravir. A rolling review was ongoing for tixagevimab / cilgavimab. Other widely used treatments for hospitalised patients include anticoagulants. These therapies have shown variable efficacy depending on the severity and duration of illness. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 152/168 While care for individuals with COVID -19 has improved with clinical experience gained over time, there remains an unmet need worldwide for vaccines able to pre vent or mitigate COVID -19 during the ongoing pandemic. There are currently four COVID -19 vaccines authorised in the EU to prevent COVID -19. A high global demand for suitable vaccines to help counteract the ongoing pandemic remains. 3.1.3. Main clinical studies The main evidence for efficacy for Nuvaxovid is based on two pivotal observer blinded, randomised, placebo controlled trials conducted in the US, Mexico (2019nCoV -301) and the United Kingdom (2019nCoV -302). The trials were designed to demonstrate efficacy against PCR -confirmed symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) diagnosed 7 days after completion of the second study vaccination (given 21 days after the first dose) in adult participants serologically negative (to SARS- CoV-2) at baseline until the endpoint- driven efficacy analysis was triggered by the occurrence of a prespecified number of blinded endpoints. In study - 302, 15,187 subjects were randomised 1:1 to receive NVX -CoV2373 or (saline). In 29,949 subjects were ra ndomised 2:1 to NVX -CoV2373 or placebo. The primary efficacy analyses were conducted in 14,039 (92.4%) randomised participants in 2019nCoV -301. The efficacy analysis was event -driven in both studie s, with 62 cases in the interim and 106 in the final analysis for 2019nCoV -302, and 77 cases for the analysis in 2019nCoV -301. 3.2. Favourable effects The estimated VE for the single primary analysis based on 77 accrued cases in 2019nCoV -301 was 90.4% (95% CI: 82.9, 94.6). Vaccine efficacy according to the primary efficacy endpoint was therefore demonstrated for both pivotal trials. The confirmatory analysis at the interim analysis based on 62 accrued cases in 2019nCoV -302 indicated a VE point estimate of 89.3% with a multiplicity adjusted 96.9% CI of 73.0% to 95.8%, meeting the prespecified study success criterion of an alpha -adjusted LBCI > 30%. VE was consistent in the final efficacy analysis after accrual of 106 cases, with an estimated VE of 89.7% (95%CI: 80.2, 94.6%). In 2019nCoV -301, 4 cases were classified as severe, all in the placebo group. With respect to hospitalisation, there was 1 case of COVID -19 hospitalisation in 2019nCoV -302 and 3 in 2019nCoV - 301. At the time of the final analysis in 2019nCoV -302 there were 4 cases classified as severe in the placebo group and none in the NVX -CoV2373 group occurring at least 7 days after the second dose in serologically negative adult participants in the PP -EFF analysis set. The efficacy was consistent with the level of protection in the general study population in older adults 65 years [2019nCoV -302: estimated VE 88. on 1/1953 vs 9/1957 cases for vaccine and control groups respectively], and in participants with comorbid estimated VE of NVX -CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 due to a SARS- CoV-2 variant considered a VOC or VOI in baseline 97.1). The most common VOC was B.1.1.7 (Alpha), which was fo und in 46 cases. PCR results of the final analysis by SARS -CoV-2 strain showed estimated VEs of NVX-CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 in baseline seronegative CHMP assessment report B.1.1.7 and 96.4% (95% CI: 73.8, 99.5) for the ancestral (Wuhan) strain. An immune response in terms of both the humoral response against S protein (binding antibodies) and SARS- CoV-2 virus (neutrali sation assays) an d the cellular response have been shown in vaccinated subjects. The second dose is required to improve immunogenicity. Furthermore, safety and immunogenicity data from 2019nCoV -101 supported the inclusion of the adjuvant. 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations abou t favourable effects Data on vaccine efficacy is available for 76 days for study 2019nCoV -301 and approximately 90 days since dose 2 from 2019nCoV -302. Therefore, the duration of protection is unknown. Longer -term vaccine efficacy will be further followed post -authorisation . Although encouraging trends were observed, reliable efficacy estimates against severe COVID -19 and hospitalisation caused by COVID -19 could not be established due to the lack of a sufficient number of cases within the clinical studies. From the experience with other vaccines it is expected that prevention of severe COVID -19 will be achieved by preventing COVID -19 overall. Although observed point estimates of vaccine efficacy were consistent across age groups, the number of cases in 65 to 84 years of age were limited. Available data are insufficient to establish efficacy in subjects seropositive for SARS -CoV-2 at baseline. However, efficacy is anticipated in this group to the extent that natural immunity does not fully protect against re -infection, which is presently not fully characterised. Immunocompromised patients were excluded from the trials, as well as pregnant and breast -feeding women. Few HIV+ subjects were enrolled in the supportive trial 2019nCoV -501. Further data in these subgroups should be collected post -authorisation. Data are limited in subjects with severe and/or uncontrolled underlying disease, and there is no data in persons with autoimmune diseases since these subjects were excluded from the clinical trials. Although efficacy was shown against the B.1.1.7 variant, strain specific efficacy results should be interpreted with caution given the low number of cases for individual strains and potential confounding. The extent of cross -neutralisation of circulating an d newly emerging strains of SARS -CoV-2 (including Delta and Omicron ) remains uncertain, more data should be generated post -authorisation. Further support for the efficacy of NVX- CoV2373 comes from trial 2019nCoV -501 which was conducted in South Africa and included both HIV -negative and HIV -positive participants. During the trial, a new variant emerged (B.1.351, Beta variant). The overall est imated VE in this study (48.6% (95% CI: 28.4, 63.1)) is lower than what is observed in study 2019nCoV -301 and 2019nCoV -302, also when looking only at the HIV -negative population. Whilst this may to some extent be explained by the circulating variant ( Beta), immunogenicity results of the participants enrolled in this study also point to a reduced immune response after vaccination (measured against the Wuhan strain) compared to the response observed in 2019nCoV -302. Thus, it cannot be excluded that the lower VE is explained by more factors than the circulating virus variant alone, for example differences in baseline characteristics of the population enrolled , or potential batch related issues. To date no correlate of protection has been established. Therefore, the clinical relevance of immunogenicity data is difficult to interpret. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 154/168 3.4. Unfavourable effects The safety was characterised in four clinical trials, in which 30,058 participants have been exposed to NVX-CoV2373 of whom 28,963 (96.4%) to two doses. The pla cebo group included 19,892 participants, with 19,270 (96.9%) receiving two doses. The median duration of follow -up in the pooled safety database was 70 days post -Dose 2. Solicited local and systemic reactions were reported at a higher incidence in the NVX -CoV2373 group than in the placebo group after each injection. The frequency and severity of solicited reactions increased with the second dose compared to the first. In 2019nCoV -302/2019nCoV -301, solicited local AEs were reported by 58% of NVX -CoV2373 reci pients following the first dose and 79% following the second dose, compared to 21% and 21% of placebo recipients after the first and second dose respectively. Pain and tenderness were the most commonly reported local reactions in both pivotal studies, reported by 34% (pain) and 53% (tenderness) after the first dose of NVX -CoV2373. After the second dose, pain was reported by 59% and tenderness by 74%. In the placebo group rates were between 11% and 17% and did not increase with the second dose. Local reactio ns were mostly mild to moderate, with 1.1% of participants in the NVX -CoV2373 group reporting grade 3 local reactions after the first dose in either study and 6.6% after the second dose. Local reactions pain and tenderness had a median duration of 1 to 2 days after the first dose and 2 to 3 days after the second dose. Headache, fatigue, and muscle pain were the most frequent solicited systemic AEs , reported by 25%, 25%, and 23% post dose 1 compared to 23%, 22%, and 13% in the placebo group respectively, and by 44%, 49%, and 48% post dose 2 compared to 19%, 21%, and 12% in the placebo group. The median duration of headache, fatigue and muscle pain was 1 day after each dose in both studies. For GI reactions (nausea/ vomiting), after the first dose rates are co mparable between the NVX -CoV2373 group and the placebo group, however with the second dose reported nausea/vomiting doubled in the vaccine group. The median duration of headache, fatigue and muscle pain was 1 day after each dose. Fever increased substantia lly with the second dose in the NVX -CoV2373 group (from 0.5% after dose 1 to 5.6% after dose 2). Systemic reactions were mostly mild with 2.3% reporting grade 3 systemic reactions after the first dose, and 12% reporting grade 3 systemic reactions following the second dose. Grade 4 reactions were reported by 0.1%. In the safety subsets, unsolicited AEs within the 49 days after first vaccination (28 days after the second dose) were reported more frequently in NVX -CoV2373 recipients than among placebo recipients overall (23.8% vs 18.7% in study 2019nCoV -302 and 16.3% vs 14.8% in 2019nCoV -301). This was driven mainly by the SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions, nervous system disorders and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, which mostly reflect the reactogenicity of NVX- CoV2373. A similar imbalance was seen in treatment -related TEAEs, which again was explained by the reactogenicity. Severe TEAEs occurred in < 1% of participants. A numerical imbalance was seen in the reports of severe TEAEs related to hypertension in 2019- nCoV302. In a pooled safety analysis, a higher incidence of hypertension following NVX -CoV2373 was seen in older adults, over 65 years of age. There were 4 SAEs of hypertension as well as 13 severe cases of h ypertension in the NVX -CoV2373 vaccinated participants. Hypertension is considered an adverse drug reaction of NVX -CoV2373. There were no deaths considered related to study vaccine, with similar rates between vaccine groups. Overall, the incidence of SAEs was low and similar in the between the vaccine groups in study 2019nCoV -302 and 2019nCoV -501. In study 2019nCoV -301, there numerically more SAEs in the CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 155/168 SOC of Hepatobiliary Disorders, mainly driven by events related to cholecystitis (9 vs 0). Addition ally, there were more serious adverse events of prostate cancer (5 vs 0), cerebrovascular accident (7 vs 1) and hypertension/hypertensive crisis (4 vs 0) in the NVX -CoV2373 treatment group. There were three cases of myocarditis following vaccination with NVX -CoV2373, which may be related to the vaccine based on the TTO. Considering the experience with other COVID -19 vaccines, myocarditis was included as an important potential risk in the RMP. 3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects There is a lack of long -term safety data, with a median follow up of 3 months after the second dose in the pivotal trials. Long term safety up to 1 year is available for the platform (Recombinant Nanoparticle Vaccine Antigens with Matr ix-M1 Adjuvant) with no emerging safety signal. No difference was observed with regard to the incidence and severity of reactogenicity in subjects who were seropositive for SARS -CoV-2 at baseline compared with subjects who were seronegative for SARS- CoV-2 at baseline. Whilst hypertension has been identified as an uncommon adverse drug reaction for Nuvaxovid , there is insufficient information available to determine the clinical impact of this ADR. Immunosuppressed /immune- deficient individuals, with excepti on of HIV infected individuals on stable antiviral therapy, were excluded from the study. The safety data base for immunocompromised individuals is limited to 244 subjects with medically stable HIV infection (122 in each treatment group) included in 2019nCo V-501. The submitted safety and reactogenicity data in this subpopulation did not reveal any concern. No safety data are available for immunocompromised individuals other than HIV. No safety data are available for individuals with autoimmune disorders and individual under immune-suppressive treatment. There is limited clinical data in pregnant women, with 95 pregnancies reported in the clinical trials of which the majority (60) were still ongoing at the time of reporting. There were no stillbirths or f oetal deaths. There are no data available on the safety of Nuvaxovid administered during breastfeeding. Persons with stable comorbidities were included in the pivotal trials. In 2019nCoV -302, almost half of participants (45%) had a comorbidity or BMI greater than 30. In 2019nCoV -301, the majority of participants were overweight or obese (70.2%), 14% had a chronic lung disease, 8% had Diabetes mellitus type 2, 1% had c ardiovascular disease and 0.6% had chronic kidney disease. There were lower frequencies and in tensities of solicited local and systemic AEs after each vaccination among Nuvaxovid recipients with co- morbidities of obesity, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus type 2 than the overall population. Frailty has not been e valuated yet. Therefore, use in frail patients with co -morbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) has been identified as missing information in the safety specifications o f the RMP . Available non -clinical and clinical data do not raise a concern regarding vaccine -enhanced respiratory disease. The possibility of enhanced disease cannot be excluded with certainty and is listed as an important potential risk in the RMP. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 156/168 3.6.

For a full summary of all advers e reactions refer to the Summary of Product Information section 4.8 3.7. Benefit -risk assessment and discussion 3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects Overall, vaccine efficacy of two doses of Nuvaxovid administered with an interval of 21 days has been demonstrated for the prevention of symptomatic COVID -19 disease with onset of at least 7 days after second vaccination in adults 18 years of age, as well as an acceptable safety profile, based on two large pivotal phase 3 trials included in this cMAA. The results are considered robust based on the study design and are further supported by the different secondary endpoints and analyses. Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed efficacy for elderly (65 years), as well as for participants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe COVID -19, which is considered as the population at highest need for preventative strategies. Efficacy against COVID -19 was demonstrated in each participating country, including South Africa (where the variant of concern B.1.351 (Beta) was the predominant circulating strain during the study), although efficacy was of lower magnitude compared to other region/countries. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 158/168 No reliable efficacy estimat e can currently be established against severe COVID -19 or hospitalisation; however, it is likely that severe disease will be prevented as a consequence of preventing symptomatic COVID -19. Further follow up is expected in post -authorisation effectiveness st udies to confirm this. A shortcoming of the current efficacy dataset is the short median follow up of approx. 90 days since dose 2 from 2019nCoV -302 and 76 days for 2019nCoV -301. Longer -term vaccine efficacy will be further followed pos t-authorisation . It would be desirable to confirm if this vaccine also has an effect on asymptomatic infection and viral transmission. This is evaluated as part of secondary objectives in both pivotal trials and data are expected pos t-authorisation . These aspects however may not be adequately characterised based on clinical trial data and will likely need to be further elucidated post- authorisation. The observed safety profile is considered well characterised and acceptable based on the short -term data available. The safety o f Nuvaxovid is mainly characterised by local and systemic reactions occurring during the first 7 days after vaccination. Reactions were mostly mild to moderate, transient and self -limited. Reactions were more frequent and more severe with the second dose. The reactogenicity was milder and lower in older adults aged 65 years compared to the younger adults aged 18 to 64. SAEs and AESIs were infrequent in the NVX- CoV2373 and placebo groups. Long term safety has to be characterised further, and it is importan t to analyse the full safety follow -up of the ongoing trials , which is 12 months for 2019nCoV302 and 2019nCoV501, and 24 months for 2019nCoV301 The current dataset gives no indication of vaccine -enhanced disease, a potential risk that will be followed up a s detailed in the RMP. There is limited data on use in pregnant women, but a protective effect is anticipated. Preclinical data are reassuring; therefore, noting that pregnancy as such is a risk factor for severe COVID19, and that pregnant women may additi onally belong to other risk groups, vaccination may be considered on a case by case basis. Data in pregnancy will be generated post -authorisation. There are no data in breast -feeding women. Based on biological plausibility, no risk in breast- feeding is ant icipated. No participants with severe immunodeficiency were included in the studies. Such patients may not be protected as well as immunocompetent individuals by vaccination. However, no safety issues are anticipated, and the benefit -risk balance in immuno compromised subjects is deemed positive, also in light of the underlying excess risk of COVID -19. Further data should be collected post -authorisation. Also, subjects with severe underlying diseases were not included in the studies, and the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in these groups will be followed up post -authorisation. Regarding seropositive subjects, no safety issues have been observed in this population, and efficacy can be anticipated. Therefore, the vaccine can be administered without per forming previous SARS - CoV-2 serology testing. Uncertainties concerning the pharmaceutical characteri sation of the commercial product are compatible with a positive benefit- risk balance. 3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks The available clinical data for Nuvaxovi d, including the induction of immune responses and the demonstrated vaccine efficacy, establish the benefits to prevent COVID -19 in immuni sed individuals 18 years of age and older. The lack of any serious safety concerns for subjects aged 18 years and abov e allows concluding on a positive benefit- risk balance in the proposed indication . CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 159/168 3.7.3. Additional considerations on the benefit -risk balance Given the current pandemic situation, the demonstrated favourable effect and considering the overall characteristics of the unfavourable effects, a positive benefit -risk balance in the proposed indication is concluded for this vaccine . Conditional marketing authorisation The potency of the finished product batches used in clinical studies was not adequately linked to the potency of the commercially manufactured batches, raising uncertainty in comparing the potency of commercial finished product batches with those of clinical batches and defining clinically qualified potency limits based on batches used in clinical phase 3 trials. Based on the clarifications provided by the applicant, it can be concluded that the commercial batches are at least as potent as the least potent batch used in clini cal studies. In addition, the lower limit for the product potency specification was increased, which is considered a conservative approach. However, to further support this conclusion, as a Specific Obligation, the applicant should bridge the relevant refe rence standard lots (i.e. calibrate reference standards BN2 -0620- and 20_PRS_SARS -CoV-2 against each other in the Gen1v2 finished product assay in the presence of Matrix -M1) to firmly link the potencies of finished product batches used in clinical phase 3 studies to those of commercial batches. Once the reference standards are adequately bridged, the finished product release and shelf -life acceptance criteria of the potency assay should be reviewed and updated as appropriate. The proposed specifications, as demonstrated by the submitted data, are suitable to control product quality. Due to the development of this vaccine under accelerated timelines, real time stability data for finished product are limited. However, data from clinical batches are consider ed representative to support the shelf life of the finished product. As a Specific Obligation the applicant is requested to provide additional stability data on commercial batches to further support the shelf life of the product. The characterisation and control of the active substance and finished product are considered acceptable in the context of a conditional Marketing Authorisation in the current (COVID -19) pandemic emergency situation. Nevertheless, additional data to ensure consistent quality are con sidered important to confirm the finished product stability and to ensure appropriate links to the clinical material in relation to control of potency, and these data should be provided post -authorisation as specific obligations to the MA. Studies are underway and it is expected that the applicant will be able to provide the requested data and thereby fulfil the specific obligations. Based on the applicant's justification and commitment, it is expected that data to fulfil the specific obligations will be su bmitted between February 2022 and end of January 2023. As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was requested by the applicant in the initial submission. The product falls within the scope of Article 14 -a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the prevention of a life -threatening disease. Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing authorisation: The benefit -risk balance is positive, as discussed. It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. Nuvaxovid falls within the scope of the conditional marketing authoris ation Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726 /2004 indent 2: Medicinal products to be used in emergency situations as recogni sed by Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council No. 1082/2013/EU on serious cross -border CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 160/168 threats to health amended with date of last review on 28/05/2020 to adopt measure to cope with the impact of the crisis following the COVID -19 outbreak. For Module 3 data the commitments are made with specified timelines and data will be delivered accordingly. It is therefore considered likely that the applicant will be able to provide the requested data and thereby fulfil the specific obligations. Unmet medical needs will be addressed. Currently, four COVID -19 vaccines are authorised in the EU , under conditional marketing authorisations : Comirnaty, Spikevax, Covid -19 Vaccine Janssen, and Vaxzevria. While these vaccine s all demonstrated a positive benefit -risk balance , they are not covering the supply need in the European Union , and there is still an urgent need to provide additional prophylactic options in the context of the pandemic across the EU . Further authorised vaccines are therefore needed to increase the total supply and availability to fully vaccinate the EU/EAA population. The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fac t that additional data are still required. The product provides immediate benefit for the vaccinated population in preventing COVID -19 disease. Data from Israel are suggesting that vaccination not only prevents COVID -19, but also limits the spread of the v irus. Decreasing the number of patients suffering from COVID -19, as well as the spread of the virus impacts positively the health care systems, not only financially, but primarily in terms of capacity and focus on standard care of other diseases. Moreover, data from clinical trials also show Nuvaxovid protection from new variant strains (e.g., B.1.1.7/501Y.V1 first identified in the UK and B.1.351/501Y.V2 first identified in South Africa). According to the WHO\u00b4s COVID -19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for 2021, vaccine availability, accessibility, and deployment are the highest health, social, economic, and political priorities for virtually every country, agency, business and community around the world. The justifications presented by the applicant are considered valid and acceptable. Therefore, a Conditional marketing authorisation may be granted as long as the benefit -risk balance of Nuvaxovid remains positive after the assessment of all submitted data. 3.8. Conclusions The overall benefit -risk balance of Nuvaxovid is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 'Recommendations'. Eligibility to a conditional marketing authorisation as well as requirements have been demonstrated in line with provisions of Article 14 -a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 161/168 4. Recommendations Outcome Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit -risk balance of Nuvaxovid is favourable in the following indication: Nuvaxovid is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV-2 in individuals 18 years of age and older. The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the following co nditions: In view of the declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern and in order to ensure early supply this medicinal product is subject to a time -limited exemption allowing reliance on batch control testing conducted in the registered site(s) that are located in a third country. This exemption ceases to be valid on 31 March 2022. Implementation of EU based batch control arrangements, including the necessary variations to the terms of the marketing authorisation, has to be completed by 31 Ma rch 2022 at the latest. Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. Official batch release In accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC, the official batch release will be undertaken by a state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose. Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation Periodic Safety Update Reports The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are se t out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web- portal. The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 6 months following authorisation. Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product Risk Management Plan (RMP) The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. An updated RMP should be submitted: At the request of the European Medicines Agency; CHMP assessment report EMA/783213/2021 Page 162/168 Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit -risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. Specific Obligation to complete post -authorisation measures for the conditional marketing authorisation This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14 -a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: Description Due date In order to ensure consistent product quality during shelf life, the MAH should provide additional information on stability of the finished product. 31 January 2023 In order to ensure consistent quality over the product life cycle, the MAH should adequately bridge the reference standards and review the finished product potency limits when additional data become available. 31 July 2022 New Active Sub stance Status Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that SARS -CoV-2 recombinant spike protein is to be qualified as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.
